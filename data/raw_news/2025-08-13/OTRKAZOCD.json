  "description": "Could this be the gadget to topple the Airwrap off its pedestal?",
  "content": "\u2022 Dreame has launched the Dazzle hair styler in the US\n\u2022 Currently on sale for $249.99 (was $299.99)\n\nDreame has added a new gadget to its haircare lineup \u2013 the Dazzle multi-styler \u2013 and I'm excited. I've reviewed most of the best Airwrap alternatives on the market, and this looks like the most serious rival to Dyson's super-styler, as well as offering perhaps the best value for money of any dupe.\n\nIt doesn't do everything the Airwrap i.d. can (I'll get into the differences below), but there are features I haven't seen in any other dupe, and it's a lot cheaper \u2013 half the price at MSRP, and even less than that right now thanks to an early discount: it's currently $249.99 (was ) at Dreame. (It's currently only available in the US, but Dreame has a big presence in the UK and I'm hoping it'll launch here soon too at a similar bargain price \u2013 I've reached out to the brand for confirmation.)\n\nWhat features, exactly? Firstly, Dreame has added attachment recognition. So when you snap on, say, a curl barrel, it'll automatically switch to the recommended temperature and speed settings for that attachment. That's still a very rare feature, even amongst the very best hair stylers on the market.\n\nSecond, the maximum heat setting has been bumped up. My major complaint with the Dreame AirStyle Pro was that it didn't get hot enough to dry my hair or set in styles (I'm all for protecting my hair from heat damage, but you do need some heat for a hair styler to actually be useful). The Dazzle has a cold setting, and heat settings of 134.6F / 57C and 194F / 90C. That's the same maximum temperature as the Airwrap i.d., whereas the AirStyle Pro topped out at 176F / 80C.\n\nYou're also getting a digital display, which shows you at a glance what settings you're using. I'm not so excited about that bit, but I guess it might be helpful.\n\nI've been comparing the Dazzle to the Airwrap, but actually it's perhaps more similar to the Shark FlexStyle. Like that gadget, the top section pivots to 90-degrees for drying, rather than using an additional drying attachment to redirect the airflow. I've tested out models that use both approaches and both can be equally effective.\n\nIt also has a similar metallic color scheme to the FlexStyle. I am a little sad Dreame hasn't opted for the unique leather-look finish it used on the AirStyle Pro here, although the higher maximum temperature means I'd still choose the Dazzle over that gadget.\n\nHow does the Dazzle compare to an Airwrap?\n\nThe Dazzle looks incredible for the price, but it's not quite as good as the newest Airwraps. There are currently two main models to choose between: the Airwrap i.d. (which launched in August 2024) and the Dyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x (which went on sale in the US in July 2025 but isn't yet available in the UK).\n\nBoth of those models have a curl.i.d. switch that launches an automated curl sequence \u2013 wrap, curl, cool shot \u2013 with timings based on your specific hair type. They hook up to a companion app, so you can provide information about your hair, and can adjust settings and watch as the sequence counts down.\n\nThe Co-anda 2x also has attachment recognition, and it's a step up on Dreame's offering in that it'll switch to your last-used settings with each tool, rather than reverting to a default.\n\nBoth of those upgrades are useful. I found the curl.i.d. feature a major game-changer on the Airwrap i.d. \u2013 it's just so effortless, and as a result I found my curls lasted longer because I wasn't having to manually switch settings or guess how long I'd been doing each bit for. I haven't tested the Co-anda 2x yet, but I've used Dyson's attachment recognition on the Supersonic Nural, where I found it helped smooth out the styling process.\n\nWhether they're worth the (considerable) extra cost is another thing. If you're in the mood to splash some cash, I don't think you'd be disappointed with the Airwrap, but if you're looking for bang for your buck, the Dazzle looks hard to beat.\n\nYou might also like...\n\u2022 Dyson Supersonic vs Airwrap: do I need both?\n\u2022 Dyson's new hair dryer is a feat of engineering \u2013 but there's one annoying design feature you need to know about if you're thinking of buying one\n\u2022 How to get your Airwrap curls to hold, plus more top tips for getting the most from your Dyson multi-styler",

      "text": "The best Dyson Airwrap dupes 2025: affordable alternatives, tried and tested\nWe tested a range of affordable Airwrap alternatives \u2013 here are the best of the bunch\nToday's best Dyson Airwrap dupes manage to capture some of the magic of Dyson's ultra-popular styler, without the eye-watering price tag. All the options here have been put through their paces by our team of experienced reviewers, and got the stamp of approval. They might not be up there with the original Airwrap, but they're all excellent stylers in their own right.\nThe Dyson Airwrap introduced a new way to curl hair, without the need for the extreme heat of traditional tongs. Rather than a heated wand, the Airwrap has barrels that blast out air in such a way that hair automatically wraps around, and is shaped into coils as it dries. Today's best Airwrap dupes replicate this effect very well. However, we've yet to find one that can manage clockwise and anticlockwise curls on the same barrel attachment, as the real Airwrap can; instead, you'll need to swap between two barrels.\nThe Airwrap also has various attachments that turn it into one of the best multi-styler tools around. Quality and variety of compatible attachments is something else we've considered when pulling together this ranking.\nThe newest version of the Airwrap has switch that launches an automated curl sequence (again, something no dupe offers). Head to our Dyson Airwrap i.d. review to find out how we got on when we tested it. Alternatively, read about its predecessor in our Dyson Airwrap (2022) review, or see how the two compare in our Dyson Airwrap vs Airwrap i.d. explainer.\nIf you're upgrading your styling kit, we also have guides to the best hair dryers and the best hair straighteners. Happy where you are? Read on to discover the best Dyson Airwrap dupes around today.\nThe quick list\nTop pick\nBest overall\nThis is perhaps the closest Airwrap dupe, with a wide range of attachments, including auto-wrap curling barrels. It's on the pricier side, but it's still cheaper than the Airwrap.\nUK pick\nBest affordable \u2013 UK\nIt doesn't feel hugely premium, but this affordable multi-styler does almost everything an Airwrap can, including auto-wrapping your curls.\nUS pick\nBest affordable \u2013 US\nThis styler delivers Airwrap-like features at a manageable price, with six effective attachments, including auto-wrap curl barrels.\nCheap pick\nBest cheap \u2013 UK\nWhile it won't auto-wrap, this styler has a rotating barrel brush that can be used to smooth, volumize and curl your locks, for that professional blow-dry finish.\nWonderful waves\nBest for waves\nWant big curls and waves? This styler comes with four attachments, including a 50mm soft bristle brush that's perfect for just that.\nNatural curls\nFor curly hair\nNot many hot air stylers ship with a diffuser, but this Revamp one does. The various tools can be used to create a wide range of styles.\nThe best Dyson Airwrap dupes 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best Dyson Airwrap dupe\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe closes Dyson Airwrap dupe we've tested is the Shark FlexStyle. It's one of only a few alternatives that use the same auto-wrap Coanda technology that the Airwrap became popular for. Here, the curl barrels function almost identically to the Airwrap's, save for the fact you'll need to swap barrels over to change the direction of curl.\nElsewhere, the FlexStyle boasts a nice wide range of compatible accessories (not quite as wide as Dyson's, but much better than most other brands offer). In some cases you can create your own bundle, so you just choose the attachments you need and aren't lumbered with a load that don't suit your hair needs. On test, we were especially impressed with the paddle brush. It's also the only dupe we've come across to feature a finishing tool \u2013 the 'FrizzFighter', to rival Dyson's FlyAway attachment. We didn't test this so can't vouch for its effectiveness, though.\nThe design is balanced and comfortable to hold, even for extended periods. The top section can be twisted to 90-degrees when using as a hair dryer, enabling you to easily direct the airflow without extending your arms. It also packs a good amount of power, for speedy styling.\nWhile much cheaper than the Airwrap, the FlexStyle is still fairly pricey, and if you're on a budget there are cheaper options at #2 (for the UK) and #3 (for the US) worth considering. However, it's well built and worth the investment if you need the versatility.\nRead more: Shark FlexStyle review\nThe best affordable Dyson Airwrap dupe in the UK\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe (deep breath) Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler is our favorite affordable Airwrap dupe in the UK. This tube-shaped multi-styler comes with various styling attachments \u2013 including the all-important auto-wrap curl barrels. Aside from the fact you'll need to swap barrels over when you want to change the direction of curl, these work almost identically to the real Airwrap. A nice touch is the easily accessible Pause button to switch off the blower, so you can remove the wand without disturbing your curls.\nThe Dynamic Radiance Pro can also be used with nothing attached, to rough-dry hair. In this mode it packs a decent amount of power, and the pivoting top section is helpful for directing the airflow without having to extend your arm. The build quality is a little on the cheap side, and our tester found the button placement meant it was a little too easy to accidentally change the settings mid-style, though.\nThere's a decent range of attachments included \u2013 our tester was a big fan of the large oval bristle brush for creating bouncy low-dries \u2013 and they come on and off easily and feel secure in use. However, unlike the Shark (#1) that's it for compatible accessories; you can't pick more specialized add-ons to purchase separately or bundle in.\nOverall, if you're looking for an Airwrap dupe that delivers a lot for a far more affordable price than the original, this Revamp model is a great choice.\nRead our full Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler review\nThe best affordable Dyson Airwrap dupe in the US\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLooking for performance and features that are close to the Dyson Airwrap but at a far lower price? Our top dupe in the US is the Sharper Image Revel 6-in-1 Multi-Styler is a pretty strong bet. It's one of a handful Airwrap dupes (including the Shark at #1) that uses the Coanda effect to create curls, and it comes with enough power and accessories to make it an effective styler a range of hair types.\nThe design is a little more premium than other dupes in this list, with the rubberized finish making it comfortable to grip. There are three power and three temperature settings plus a cool shot to lock in your style. Alongside your auto-wrap curl barrels, the accessories are mostly limited to different brushes \u2013 unusually, there's no concentrator here, and no diffuser either.\nOur reviewer, who has super-curly type 4c hair, was impressed by the Sharper Image Revel's performance, finding that it it dried her hair quickly without any noticeable heat damage but a little frizz, and did a good job of both straightening and curling. She noted, though, that for best results you'll have to put a lot of practice into using the Revel, and even then you might need to lower your expectations of what you'll get from an all-in-one tool.\nRead our full Sharper Image Revel 6-in-1 Multi-Styler review\nThe best cheap Dyson Airwrap alternative in the UK\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Remington Curl and Straight Confidence Airstyler AS8606 (also known as the Remington Pro Rotating Hot Air Styler AS8606 in the US) is a great Airwrap alternative if you're on a very tight budget. While there's no auto-wrap curl barrels, this styler has a different solution: it can be set to rotate automatically when the barrel brush tool is attached, to mimic the curl and smoothing action that hairdressers make look so easy when blow drying locks.\nThis versatile styler can smooth, volumize and curl, and on test we found it effective at creating both straight and bouncy hair styles. However, it's not the most powerful option here, and with only two temperature settings and two windspeeds, you have less precise control compared to other models in this list (which tend to have three of each). We found the curling tong was a little fiddly to use, requiring some patience and practice. On the downside, this tool is a little bulky, and only comes with one, rather large brush attachment, making it best for use on mid-length and longer hair.\nRead more: Remington Curl and Straight Confidence Airstyler AS8606 review\nThe best Dyson Airwrap dupe for big curls and waves\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe BaByliss Air Style 1000 is another UK-only Airwrap alternative that's worth considering if you're on a budget. There are no auto-wrap curl barrels here, but it ships with a selection of four attachments: a drying nozzle, soft round bristle brush, a paddle brush and a conical barrel for soft curls.\nOn test, we found our tester managed to create bouncy results but found the process time-consuming \u2013 especially because the dryer isn't especially powerful. Some of the attachments are a little fiddly, and the fact they heat up in use and lack stay-cool sections means you'll need to keep the heat-resistant glove handy for swapping them over. The soft bristle brush is on the large side, making it best suited to those with long hair.\nThere are some compromises you'll need to make with this styler, but it's affordable enough that it's still a decent buy \u2013 provided you have the patience to achieve good results.\nRead more: BaByliss Air Style 1000 review\nThe best Dyson Airwrap dupe for curly hair\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you have naturally curly hair then this Airwrap alternative is worth considering, as it\u2019s one of a handful of options that ships with a diffuser. This attachment disperses the air stream when drying, so it doesn\u2019t disrupt the curl pattern. In total there are six attachments, including different-sized round brushes, and one of the narrowest curling tong attachments we've come across, making it ideal for creating everything from soft bouncy waves to tight curls in all lengths of hair.\nOn test, we found it was able to effectively smooth and wave hair \u2013 although you won't get the auto-wrap curl effect the Airwrap is known for, and which is included on the other Revamp styler here (#2). Our reviewer found the 6-in-1 Ionic Airstyle bulky to hold, and struggled to to clamp hair against the curling tong easily, and the attachments could be tricky to remove, too. However, she was impressed by the hinged filter, which made it easy to clean dust and lint.\nRead more: Revamp Progloss Airstyle 6-in-1Air Styler DR-1250 review\nHow to choose the best Dyson Airwrap dupe for you\nWhen it comes to buying the best Airwrap alternative for you, there are a number of features you should consider.\nFirst of all, decide how much versatility you want from the hot air styler. Do you only ever smooth and straighten your hair, or are you looking for a styler that can also add volume and create soft waves, or even tight curls? Look for models that come bundled with the correct attachments for these different looks.\nIf you regularly curl your hair, you\u2019ll find a hot air styler that has a grip on the tong invaluable as it means you don\u2019t have to hold the tresses while they\u2019re wrapped around the attachment. Similarly, smaller brushes are best suited to those with shorter, to mid-length hair, as if a brush is too wide, you\u2019ll struggle to get a defined wave unless your hair is long.\nThe higher the wattage of Airwrap dupe, the faster the airflow, which means it will dry and style your hair quicker. Also consider the number of temperature settings it offers. If you have fine or colored hair, you\u2019ll need a lower temperature setting to reduce heat damage, whereas coarser hair can withstand higher temperatures.\nAirwrap alternatives with cool shot buttons are ideal for \u2018setting\u2019 hair styles so they don\u2019t drop as quickly, while longer cables enable you to style your hair without having to be positioned right next to an electrical outlet.\nFrequently asked questions about Dyson Airwrap dupes\nHow similar are Dyson Airwrap dupes to the original?\nIn terms of the basics, fairly well. The very best Airwrap dupes feature the auto-wrap curl barrels that the original Airwrap was known for. These use the Coanda effect to wrap hair around the barrel, shaping it into curls as it dries it. The auto-wrap barrels on Airwrap dupes are functionally almost identical to the first Airwrap.\nDyson has moved a step ahead of the competition now, though: you can create clockwise and anticlockwise curls on the same barrel, whereas all dupes require you to swap over your barrel. The newest version, the Airwrap i.d., has a curl switch that runs through a curl plus cool shot cycle, timed specifically to suit your hair, at the flick of a switch. Again, you won't find that on a dupe.\nIn terms of other attachments, quality varies depending on which alternative you go for. In general, expect lower quality and less power than if you invested in an Airwrap, although, there are some very good dupes about these days.\nAre Airwrap dupes damaging to hair?\nAny hair care appliance that uses heat to style will damage the outer protective coating of hair, known as a cuticle. The cuticle is formed of layers of overlapping cells known as scales.\nThese scales line up perfectly on healthy hair and reflect light, which is why hair appears shiny. However, when hair is subject to temperatures that are too hot, tiny holes will start to appear in these cells, which not only stoops the light reflecting, but eventually leads to breakages.\nThe Airwrap alternatives we\u2019ve tested don\u2019t drop as low as 300F / 150C, which is the coolest heat setting offered by Dyson\u2019s iconic hot air styler.\nSubsequently, they will (likely) cause damage to your hair if used untreated. To mitigate this, always apply a heat protection styling spray before blow drying, and keep the heat level at the lowest setting that still enables the hair to be manipulated into the style you want.\nHow we tested these Dyson Airwrap dupes\nTo compare Airwrap dupes we assess how effective they are at smoothing, volumizing and curling our locks on all of their heat settings and how shiny and frizz-free they left our hair.\nWe also monitored the sound level, and factored in how comfortable and balanced they were to use, along with how easy the attachments were to change and any handy features such as rotating barrels, or grips on curling tongs, that make it easier to style your hair.\nWe also considered cable length, any storage options for the attachments, and even cool shot buttons.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Dreame AirStyle Pro looks great, comes in at a fairly affordable price, and includes a strong selection of styling attachments. However, it's let down by a maximum temperature that's too cool to dry anything but the finest of hair, and attachments that don't clip on securely enough. It has tons of potential, but it's hard to recommend given there are similarly priced alternatives available without its flaws.\nPros\n- +\nPremium look and feel\n- +\nComfortable to use\n- +\nWell-positioned controls\n- +\nAuto-wrap curl barrels\nCons\n- -\nNot hot enough as a dryer\n- -\nAttachments don't clip on securely\n- -\nStyles lack staying power\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nDreame AirStyle Pro: two-minute review\nThe Dreame AirStyle Pro is a multistyler that can operate as a dryer, or to create smooth, curly or bouncy styles using the various attachments supplied in the box. On paper, it looks like one for TechRadar's best hair styler roundup, but when I actually put it through its paces, a couple of design flaws quickly revealed themselves \u2013 and they're annoying enough to make this styler difficult to recommend.\nThe first is that the maximum temperature just isn't hot enough. I have collarbone-length, wavy hair that isn't overly thick, yet I wasn't able to use the Dreame AirStyle to dry it \u2013 it just took far too long. I also found that the styles created using the Dreame (in particular, the curls) lacked staying power. I'm as concerned about heat damage as the next person, but you do need some heat for these kinds of tools to be useful.\nThe second issue is that the attachments don't clip on securely enough. They twist on, but there's no 'click' at the end of that motion, which means they have a tendency to twist off again as you're using them to style.\nIt's a shame because, as I've said, the Dreame AirStyle Pro shows plenty of promise. The attachments are varied and well designed, and include those all-important auto-wrap curl barrels that position this styler as an Airwrap alternative. It's also stylishly designed and comfortable to use, with controls that are well positioned.\nPrice-wise, it isn't cheap, but it's far more affordable than Dyson's Airwrap i.d., and in line with rival products. While the Dreame AirStyle Pro's issues might not be insurmountable \u2013 you could rope in one of the best hair dryers for the start of the styling process, and take extra care not to dislodge the attachments when styling \u2013 there's no real reason to choose it over a tool such as the Shark FlexStyle, which comes in at a similar price and doesn't suffer the Dreame AirStyle Pro's issues.\nThat's the short version; read on for my full Dreame AirStyle Pro review.\nDreame AirStyle Pro review: price & availability\n- List price: $399.99 / \u00a3299 / AU$599\n- Available: US / UK / Australia\n- Launched: May 2025\nThe Dreame AirStyle Pro is available worldwide, with a list price of $399.99 / \u00a3299 / AU$599. However, at time of writing, it was reduced in all territories to $279.99 / \u00a3269 / AU$399. Such widespread discounts suggest you won't often find it at full price.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nBy comparison, the Dyson Airwrap i.d. costs $599.99 / \u00a3479.99, while the Shark FlexStyle comes in at $279.99 / \u00a3269.99. While Dyson's styler delivers a step up in quality and features, it looks like Dreame is looking to position itself more directly as a competitor to Shark. (There are cheaper Dyson Airwrap dupes, but if you want one with the auto-wrap curl barrels, it will typically fall into a similar price bracket.)\nWhile the AirStyle Pro looks good, feels high quality, and comes with a solid range of accessories, there are a couple of flaws at a functional level (a top temperature that's far too cool, and attachments that don't clip on securely) that make it difficult to recommend over the similarly priced Shark version.\nThere's a clear jump up in quality and functionality with the Dyson i.d., but I appreciate that not everyone is looking to splash that amount of cash on a styling tool (I compare all three in a bit more depth in this article, if you're interested).\n- Value for money score: 3 out of 5\nDreame AirStyle Pro specs\nWeight (styler only, no cord): | 0.6lbs / 0.3kg |\nDimensions (styler only): | 1.8 x 1.8 x 10.2in / 4.5 x 4.5 x 26cm |\nCord: | 9.2ft / 2.8m |\nTemperatures: | 2 (50C and 80C) + cool shot (room temperature) |\nSpeeds: | 3 (50m/s, 55m/s, 60m/s) |\nWattage: | 1,300W |\nAttachments: | Fast dryer, flyaway attachment, 32mm auto-wrap barrels (L+R), hard smoothing brush, soft smoothing brush, round volumizing brush |\nDreame AirStyle Pro review: design\n- Tubular dryer with six styling attachments and storage box\n- Attachments twist on, but aren't secure enough\n- Stylish, premium design with leather-look finish\nThe Dreame AirStyle Pro has a similar look to most modern multistylers: it comprises a tube-shaped dryer onto which different attachments are clipped.\nAt the end of the barrel that you hold it are the controls. Two press buttons (with indicator lights) let you toggle though two temperatures and three windspeeds. Slightly unusually, the \"cool shot\" isn't a separate button, but included as an extension of the on/off slider.\nAt the base is a removable filter cage, covering a stainless steel mesh filter that traps any fine hair and particles and keeps them out of the motor. Dreame provides a cleaner brush to help with maintenance. The cable is 9.2ft / 2.8m.\nIf you want to use the AirStyle Pro as just a dryer, you clip on the fast dryer attachment. This widens the airflow to 90-degrees to the dryer.\nAside from that, the key attachments are the 32mm auto-wrap curl barrels. Used on slightly damp hair, they attract the strands around the barrel, shaping them into curls as they dry. The idea being that this damp to dry styling is far better for your hair than using traditional hot tongs.\nIf you want to switch from clockwise to anticlockwise curls then you'll need to swap over the barrels. Currently, the only styler of this kind that can achieve two directions of curl on one barrel is the Dyson Airwrap; all the cheaper alternatives require a manual swap-over.\nElsewhere, there's an impressive range of attachments. Alongside the fast dryer and auto-wrap barrels (L+R), you get a flyaway attachment, hard smoothing brush, soft smoothing brush, and round volumizing brush.\nTo attach a tool to the dryer section, you line up spots on the base of the attachments, then twist to clip them on. Most examples of this kind of styler have a release switch around the back, but there isn't one here \u2013 you simply twist in terms of opposite direction to take off the attachment. Unfortunately, this setup isn't that secure, and in my time with the tool I often experienced attachments becoming loose mid-styling.\n- Design score: 3.5 out of 5\nDreame AirStyle Pro review: performance\n- Not hot enough to be used as a hair dryer\n- Controls are well positioned and easy to use\n- Attachments work well, but lack of heat limits performance\nI started by using the Dreame AirStyle Pro with the fast dryer attachment \u2013 and I immediately ran into problems. While the windspeed felt decent, it just wasn't getting hot enough to dry hair, even on the higher of the two temperatures. (For context, I have collarbone-length hair that I'd towel-dried from wet, so it wasn't soaking.) After several long minutes of ineffectually waving the AirStyle over my head, I gave up and switched to a dedicated hair dryer.\nI wondered if my review model was faulty, but a closer look at the specs revealed this wasn't the case. The AirStyle's two heat options are 122\u00baF / 50\u00baC and 176\u00baF / 80\u00baC. In comparison, the Airwrap has a low heat setting of 140\u00baF / 60\u00baC and a high heat setting of 194\u00baF / 90\u00baC.\nThat cooler temperature might be better for your hair, but for anyone other than those with super-fine hair, the AirStyle Pro will prove ineffective and you'll need to have a separate hair dryer on hand for this part of the styling process.\nI then tried out the auto-wrap curlers. They worked well, effectively pulling around the barrels and holding it there as it finished drying. In this part, they were similar to the Airwrap (although the Airwrap has some extra features to make the process more straightforward). As a general rule, auto-wrapped curls don't last as long as those created using hot tongs, but I found the curls created with the AirStyle Pro dropped especially quickly \u2013 again, I think this is something to do with the lower temperatures used.\nOn the plus side, the styler is comfortable to hold and balanced in weight. The buttons are well positioned, making them easy to find mid-styling and difficult to press accidentally.\nI especially like the way the cool shot is activated. It's at the top of the on/off slider, so you can easily locate the raised button by feel alone, and since it's spring-loaded, it pings back when you let go.\nOver the course of my review period, I tested out all the other attachments. Broadly, I felt they were well designed and did what they were meant to do. However, as mentioned, they don't attach securely \u2013 they simply twist on and off, with no clipping involved.\nThis proved an issue when doing anything that involved twisting the tool, and when creating curls using the round volumizing brush, I found it became loose and fell off on more than one occasion.\nThe hard smoothing brush and soft smoothing brush both feature prongs that can pivot slightly \u2013 I'm not sure of their purpose \u2013 and they worked well in practice. In fact, the two are virtually identical, except the latter has bobbles on the end of the prongs, so I'm not sure I needed both.\n- Performance score: 2.5 out of 5\nShould you buy the Dreame AirStyle Pro?\nAttribute | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Not cheap but relatively affordable. In line with other similarly designed tools that perform better. | 3 / 5 |\nDesign | Looks stylish and is comfortable to use. Attachments are varied and well designed, except for the fact they don't clip on securely. | 3.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Maximum temperature too cool for effective drying, and means curls drop quickly. Attachments can also fall off in use. | 2.5 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou have very fine hair\nThose with fine or short hair may find the AirStyle Pro's cooler temperatures in hair dryer mode perfect for their hair type.\nYou want an stylish tool\nWith its tasteful tan, faux-leather finish, this is one of the most stylish hair tools I've tested.\nYou're worried about heat damage\nThe Dreame AirStyle Pro gets far less hot than rival stylers I've tested, so if you have heat-damaged hair and don't trust yourself to stick to lower temperatures, it might be a good pick.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou have thicker or longer hair\nThe AirStyle Pro's lower temperatures likely won't cut it to dry and style thicker or longer hair.\nYou have tangle-prone hair\nI found the attachments here didn't clip on very securely, so those with denser or more tangle-prone hair might find themselves losing tools while they try to style.\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Dreame Airstyle Pro (reviewed) | Dyson Airwrap i.d. | Shark FlexStyle |\n|---|---|---|---|\nWeight (styler only, no cord): | 0.6lbs / 0.3kg | 1.4lbs / 0.6kg XXCHECK | 1.5 lbs / 0.7kg |\nStyler dimensions (L x W): | 10.2 x 1.8in / 26 x 4.5cm | 10.7 x 1.9in / 27.2 x 4.8cm | 11.3 x 1.7in / 28.7 x 4.4cm |\nCord: | 9.2ft / 2.8m | 8.5 ft / 2.7m | 8ft / 2.4m |\nTemperatures: | 2 + cool shot | 2 + cool shot | 3 + cool shot |\nSpeeds: | 3 | 3 | 3 |\nWattage: | 1,300W | 1,300W | 1,400W (US), 1,600W (UK) |\nList price: | $399.99 / \u00a3299 / AU$599 | $599.99 / \u00a3479.99 / AU$849 | $279.99 / \u00a3269.99 / AU$499.99 |\nDyson Airwrap i.d.\nThe Airwrap i.d. is king in this category, both in terms of price and features.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Shark FlexStyle is a versatile multi-styler with a wide range of compatible attachments, making it suitable for different hair types and lengths. It's well-designed, packs a good amount of power, and is comfortable to use. The auto-wrap barrels work as advertised and make this an affordable alternative to the Airwrap. However, we found styles could lack staying power.\nPros\n- +\nGood drying power\n- +\nWide range of attachments\n- +\nBalanced, comfortable design\n- +\nCurl barrels work like an Airwrap\n- +\nExcellent paddle brush\n- +\nWell-built\nCons\n- -\nHave to swap barrels to change curl direction\n- -\nStyles could lack staying power\n- -\nStill quite expensive\n- -\nCord a little short, with power pack\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nShark FlexStyle: two-minute review\nWe have re-reviewed the FlexStyle and thoroughly updated this article to reflect new tests, changes in pricing and availability. The overall score has increased to 3.5. The review incorporates the experiences of three testers.\nThis is the product on review:\nUS: Shark FlexStyle (HD400)\nUK: Shark FlexStyle\nAU: Shark FlexStyle (HD440)\nWe tested the UK version. There may be minor differences between different countries' models.\nThe Shark FlexStyle \u2013 or to give its full name, the Shark FlexStyle Air Styling & Hair Drying System \u2013 is a tube shaped dryer onto which a variety of tools can be attached to achieve a range of styles. We tested one out to see how it compares to the rest of the best hair stylers on the market, and were pretty impressed.\nThis is Shark's answer to the perpetually popular Dyson Airwrap. Just like that multi-styler, the FlexStyle has the all-important auto-wrap curl barrels, shape strands of hair into coils as it dries them, without the need for the scorching heat of traditional curling tongs. Functionally, these work pretty much identically to the Airwrap, although here you'll have to swap over barrels when you want to move from clockwise to anticlockwise curls. That minor annoyance aside, this is one of the very best Dyson Airwrap dupes we've tested.\nOverall, the design is balanced, comfortable to use, and feels well-built. It packs a good amount of power too \u2013 although not quite as much as one of today's best hair dryers. Beyond the auto-wrap barrels, there's a wide range of compatible accessories, which make this tool suitable for a range of hair types and lengths. In some countries you can pick the ones you want included with your FlexStyle bundle, so you're not stuck with a bunch of attachments you don't need, too.\nOn test, we found results varied by tool, with some impressing more than others. Note too that, while using the Coanda effect to create curls is undoubtedly better for your hair, it's fiddlier and the results tend to drop far quicker than when using a traditional curling tong. That's the short version; read on for our full Shark FlexStyle review.\nShark FlexStyle review: price & availability\n- List price: $279.99 / \u00a3269.99 / AU$499.99\n- Launched: 2022\nThe Shark FlexStyle launched back in 2022, and has a list price of $279.99 in the US, \u00a3269.99 in the UK and AU$499.99 in Australia. You can purchase direct from Shark or via a range of third party retailers. Shark is no stranger to a sale, so if you're smart about when you buy, you can avoid paying full price (keep an eye out for a Shark promo codes, too).\nIf you go direct to Shark in the US or UK, you can build your own bundle. You get the base model, and then pick four from the wide range of compatible accessories (the left and right curlers count as one, don't worry!). That's a clever system as it means you can choose only the tools you need for your hair type and routine. You can also purchase accessories individually from Shark.\nYou can pick up styling tools at any price, but you should expect to pay a bit of a premium for one that uses the Coanda effect for curling. The build quality here is good, and wide selection of compatible attachments and convenience of the auto-wrapping curl barrels goes some way towards justifying the expense.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe main competitor in this area is the Dyson Airwrap. The previous model (which it's still possible to get hold of... for now) comes with a list price of $599.99 / \u00a3479.99 / AU$849.99, and the newest iteration, the Airwrap i.d., is $599.99 / \u00a3479.99 / $849. So a lot pricier than the Shark. That styler does feel more premium, though, and does some useful things the FlexStyle cannot.\nAs time has gone on, we've seen more Airwrap dupes arriving on the market, and some are significantly cheaper even than the FlexStyle. For example, in the US there's the Sharper Image Revel 6-in-1 Multi-Styler for $269.99, and in the UK the Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler for \u00a3179.99.\n- Value for money score: 3.5 out of 5\nShark FlexStyle specs\nWattage: | 1400W (US), 1600W (UK) |\nTemperature settings: | 3 + cool shot |\nSpeed settings: | 3 |\nCord: | 8ft / 2.4m |\nSize w/ no attachments (L x W): | 11.3 x 1.7\" / 28.7 x 4.4cm |\nWeight w/ no attachments: | 1.5 lbs |\nAttachment options (vary by country): | 1.25\" auto-wrap curlers (L + R), 0.95\" auto-wrap curlers (L + R), concentrator, round bristle brush, paddle brush, oval bristle brush, wide tooth comb, diffuser, 'FrizzFighter' finishing tool |\nShark FlexStyle review: design\n- Easy-to-reach and use controls\n- Well-balanced and comfortable to hold\n- Attachments are sturdily built, and come on and off easily\nThe design comprises a tube-shaped dryer with various attachments. The main barrel feels balanced and fairly lightweight, with a 5.5-inch circumference that fits neatly in the palm of your hand. On the barrel you'll find the controls \u2013 an on/off toggle, buttons to adjust windspeed and temperature (there are three settings for each, with indicator lights showing which mode you're in), and a button higher up the barrel for the cool shot.\nThe dryer itself looks and feels high quality, although not quite as premium as the Airwrap. We've tested both the gold and back colorways, and far prefer the latter \u2013 the beige attachments on the gold model look rather cheap, and become dirty easily.\nThe top section pivots and locks at a right angle, reducing the length from 11.3 inches to around 8.5 inches and making it very comfortable to use as a hair dryer.\nAdding attachments makes it rather long \u2013 the 6-inch auto-wrap barrels take the total length of the styler to a somewhat cumbersome 17.5 inches \u2013 but it's a testament to Shark's engineering that it remains well balanced no matter which attachment you use. This, coupled with its light weight, makes even the most complex and long-winded styles comfortable to complete.\nWhile it\u2019s true the Shark FlexStyle can replace a number of your existing hair tools, don\u2019t expect it to save you a lot of space in the process, as many of the attachments are rather bulky. One of our review samples came with a display box, which is large but looks smart and at least gives you somewhere to stash away all the various bits neatly. (The box isn't generally included as standard, but is one of the options in the build your own bundle.)\nA minor complaint is that the cable is thick and has a power pack around a third of the way down. This makes it difficult to wrap or coil neatly for storage, and the power pack adds what feels like an unnecessary amount of bulk when lifting the styler above and around your head. Said cable is also slightly shorter than we'd ideally like, at 8ft / 2.4m.\nAttachments\nThe FlexStyle initially launched with a relatively limited range of attachments, but in the years since has added more options. Now, it boasts one of the widest ranges of compatible attachments of any multi-styler... although the selection still isn't quite as comprehensive as the Airwrap's. (Note these may vary slightly by country.) For our review, we tested the following attachments:\n- 1.25\" auto-wrap curlers\n- Concentrator\n- Paddle brush\n- Oval bristle brush\n- Diffuser\nAlso available, but not tested here, are:\n- 0.95\" auto-wrap curlers\n- Round bristle brush\n- Wide tooth comb\n- 'FrizzFighter' finishing tool (to rival Dyson's popular Flyaway tool).\nThese all snap on easily, and can be released by pulling down the lock button. They also have cool-touch areas so you can remove them without burning your fingers.\nThe auto-wrap curlers have a classy matte finish and are marked with arrows so you can see at a glance if it's a clockwise or anti-clockwise barrel. Both the oval and paddle brushes are on the large side, much larger than the size of a regular hairbrush, and certainly geared towards those with longer, thicker hair (it looks like the round bristle brush would be a better fit for mid-length locks). The diffuser is also rather chunky, and features a slider switch that enables you to extend the length of the prongs, making it suitable for longer hair.\n- Design score: 4 out of 5\nShark FlexStyle review: performance\n- Intuitive controls and easy to get started with\n- Fast overall drying speeds\n- Performance and finish vary depending on the attachment\nOverall, the styler is well balanced, not too heavy, and comfortable to use. It's also easy to get started with, although mastering each of the attachments can take a bit longer \u2013 as we'll get into in a second.\nThe settings buttons are placed at the bottom of the barrel, rather than higher up where they might be accidentally switched while gripping the styler. They're easy enough to reach if you do need to make changes mid-style, and the fact they're on a flattened section means you can locate them fairly easily by touch. However, they do sit alongside the air vents for the motor, which means you can block airflow when switching between modes.\nTo set the styler into right-angled hair dryer mode, you pull down a switch on the barrel\u2019s handle and twist the top section. In this mode, it's easy to direct the airflow precisely where it's needed. It also makes it comfortable to use with the diffuser or diffuser attached.\nThe hair dryer on its own is fast and effective. It took our fine-haired tester 2 minutes and 47 seconds to go from wet to dry hair, putting it on par with the original Dyson Supersonic. Her hair was a little frizzy and flat when dried in this way, but no more or less than when drying with other hairdryers.\nTo add attachments, turn and lock them into place and then use the unlock switch on the barrel to release them with ease. The use of an unlock switch may seem unnecessary, but it prevents the attachments from twisting and moving mid-style \u2013 a common complaint of other hair dryers and cheaper multi-stylers we've used in the past.\nAuto-wrap curl barrels\nProbably the biggest selling point of the FlexStyle is the promise of effortless curling with minimal heat damage using the auto-wrap curlers. To get the most out of these attachments, you should start by drying hair until it's around 80% dry \u2013 you can use the styler in hair dryer mode to take care of this. Achieving the optimum level of moisture in the hair requires a bit of trial and error \u2013 too wet or too dry, and the curls won't hold.\nMastering the Coanda technology also takes a bit of time, although once you've got it, it's fairly straightforward. You want to section off a bit of hair, switch the styler on and position the barrel in the bottom third of the hair. You'll see the strands start twisting around the barrel, and moving the wand backwards and forwards slightly will cause the rest of it to wrap too. The hot air then shapes the curl as it finishes drying the hair. For best results, you'll need to hit the cool shot button to set the curl before removing the wand.\nHere, the matte finish on curl barrels adds slight grip on the hair, which one of our thick-haired testers found hindered the wrapping process a little, although those with finer, slipperier hair might actually find it helps.\nIt's not a perfect system. Swapping over the barrels when you want to change the direction of curl is annoying. The air can pull in hair from other sections, or blow it in various directions while you\u2019re setting each curl, creating frizz and flyaways. All three of our testers found their curls dropped much faster than those created using a traditional tong (although our tester with thick, straight hair found that curls on day-old hair had more staying power than on freshly washed hair).\nWe will emphasize, though, that this is true of all Coanda effect curlers we've tried. You won't end up with perfect, long-lasting curls with this method, but you can achieve good body and waves with minimal heat damage.\nIf you opt to pay more for an Airwrap i.d., you'll get the convenience of not having to swap barrels to change from clockwise to anticlockwise, and there's a switch that kicks off a curl cycle (wrap, curl, cool shot) timed to your hair type, so you won't need to mess around with changing settings mid-curl. However, functionally the wrapping process and results will be very similar.\nBrush attachments\nIf you're using the oval or paddle brush, you can expect drying times to be a little longer, because you're styling as you dry. These are both fairly intuitive in use, and require far less of learning curve than the auto-wrap barrels. The large size means they're best suited to longer, thicker hair.\nTo get real volume using the oval brush, you\u2019ll need to spend time working on the roots, holding your hair straight up (or at right angles to your head), placing the brush on the underside of your hair at the base and running it up and through each strand multiple times. You can also hold the brush at the base while it sets the volume, before smoothing the rest of the hair, or rotating it as you move it through to create flicks or large curls and waves.\nOur fine-haired tester found this method gave her hair decent volume to begin with, but the style fell flat within half an hour. The large size of the oval brush makes it much better suited to long hair than short.\nThe paddle brush is used for creating smooth styles, and to use it you simply run it through strands of hair like you would a regular hair brush, keeping it face-down to smooth the cuticles. If you want to add subtle volume, angle the paddle brush up and under your roots for a few seconds before each pass. On test we found this created a smooth finish, with very little frizz. Our fine-haired tester was particularly impressed, and noted that she usually had to resort to straighteners to gain such a sleek, straight look.\n- Performance score: 3.5 out of 5\nShould I buy a Shark FlexStyle?\nAttribute | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Premium priced, as expected for a multi-styler that uses the Coanda effect. Well-built and decent value if you need the versatility. | 3.5 / 5 |\nDesign | Well balanced and easy to wield, with a wide variety of compatible attachments. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | Nice and versatile, and comfortable to use with decent power, but performance varies by tool. Styles could lack staying power. | 3.5 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou like to wear your hair in different styles\nFrom curls to waves, and straight sleek finishes to bouncy blow dries, the FlexStyle offers a wide range of attachments to tackle different styles.\nYou can't afford a Dyson Airwrap\nWhile the Airwrap is better, the FlexStyle does many of the same things for a far lower price. And functionally, the auto-wrap curling is almost identical.\nYour priority is hair health\nThe FlexStyle creates curls with much less heat than a traditional tong, which is good news for hair health in the long term.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou're short on space\nThe versatility is convenient, but collectively the dryer and all its attachments take up a lot of space.\nYou tend to do one style only\nIf you don't need multiple attachments, you'll save money by going for a simpler, dedicated tool.\nYour want curls that last\nCreating curls using air might be less damaging to your hair, but don't expect them to stick around all day \u2013 for lasting curls, traditional tongs win out.\nHow I tested the Shark Flexstyle\nThis review combines the experiences of three testers, with different hair types and styling preferences. All used the FlexStyle extensively over at least a couple of weeks, trying out all the supplied attachments. We noted how intuitive and comfortable it was to use, and how the results matched up to other styling tools we'd used. We also assessed how fast it was to style hair, and how long the results lasted.\nRead more about how we test\n- Re-reviewed March 2025\n- First reviewed October 2022\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

Its Scalp Protect mode, which adjusts temperature based on distance from the head, is great news for those with damaged hair or a sensitive scalp. Other innovations \u2013 auto-pause when the dryer is put down, the ability to remember setting preferences with each individual attachment \u2013 all streamline the styling process.

The headline feature here is the 'Scalp Protect mode', which senses how far away your head is, then heats up or cools down to maintain what feels like a constant temperature on your scalp. All that means less heat damage; even if you put it right up to your head, it won't burn.\nThe Nural can also sense when you put it down, and drop into low-power mode in response, and when not using Scalp Protect mode, it also remembers your airspeed and temperature preference for each specific attachment. On test, I found these techy features all worked as they were meant to. While I guess they're not strictly essential to the hair drying experience, they're not just a gimmick either \u2013 each helps streamline and speed up the styling process.\nAlongside these new innovations, the Nural also has all the things that made the original Supersonic \u2013 widely considered the best hair dryer on the market (read about it in our Dyson Supersonic review) \u2013 so popular. Namely, very fast and efficient airflow, a design that's comfortable and easy to wield, and a range of well-designed, magnetic attachments that clip easily on and off. These attachments cater to a range of different hair types (short, long, straight, coily and curly) and include a unique Flyaway tool, which tames stray hairs with alarming effectiveness.\nWhile the attachments are broadly the same as with the original Supersonic, I would like to give a special shout-out to the redesigned diffuser, which can now be used without the prongs in so-called Dome mode, designed to define your curls. I have natural slight curls, and it's the only diffuser I've ever been able to use that hasn't transformed my hair into a frizz-ball of epic proportions.\nOf course, it's far from cheap. In fact, so far that 'cheap' isn't even a dot in the distance. The Nural's list price of $499.99 / \u00a3399.99 / AU$750 puts it firmly beyond the reach of many, and will perhaps make you question the necessity of owning a hair dryer that glows like a UFO and knows how close it is to your head at any time. But if you want the best of the best and have the budget for it, I have basically no complaints about how well the Nural works.\nThat's the short version; read on for my full Dyson Supersonic Nural review. Alternatively, for more on this brand's haircare range, head to our Dyson AirWrap review, Dyson Airstrait review or Dyson Coralle review.\nDyson Supersonic Nural review: price & availability\n- List price: $499.99 / \u00a3399.99 / AU$749\n- Available: globally\n- Launch date: May 2024\nThe Supersonic Nural was announced in March 2024, and became available across the US, UK and Australia shortly after.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRegardless of territory, it's expensive. At TechRadar, we consider any hair dryer over $200/\u00a3200 to be a premium product, and at list price, the Nural is twice that. In the US it's $499.99, in the UK it's \u00a3399.99, and in Australia it's AU$749.\nIt's the priciest hair dryer I've tested, but then it's also the most high-tech \u2013 by some margin. You're not paying just for the Dyson name, you're paying for the innovation and the engineering. (Okay, and a little bit for the Dyson name.) While I'm not especially mad at how expensive the Nural is, I do think it would be useful to be able to pick a cheaper option with fewer attachments. With their individual sensors and magnetic design, these are presumably driving up the price, and most people will only need two or three.\nDyson has also brought out a consumer version of its professional dryer (covered in our Dyson Supersonic r review) \u2013 this one is slightly pricier all round, at $569.99 / \u00a3449.99 / AU$799. At time of writing the original Dyson Supersonic (2016) is $429.99 / \u00a3279.99 / AU$649, but it's increasingly difficult to get hold of.\nThe most expensive GHD model is the GHD Helios, which is significantly cheaper, with a list price of $279.00 / \u00a3159 / AU$280. But it's nowhere near as intelligent as the Nural; you're definitely not getting like-for-like.\n- Value for money score: 4 out of 5\nDyson Supersonic Nural specs\nWattage: | 1,600W |\nVoltage | 120V (US), 220-240V (UK) |\nAir flow | 13.3 l/s |\nDimensions (H x L x W): | 10 x 4 x 3.1\" / 245 x 97 x 78mm |\nWeight: | 1.9lb / 680g |\nAirflow settings: | 3 |\nTemperature settings: | 3 plus cool shot |\nCord length: | 8.6ft / 2.62m |\nAttachments: | Wave+Curl diffuser, gentle air attachment, styling concentrator, wide-tooth comb, flyaway attachment |\nDyson Supersonic Nural review: design\n- Scalp Protect mode adjusts temperature based on distance from head\n- Wide range of magnetic attachments for different hair types\n- Light and easy to wield, although handle could be a bit longer\nAt time of launch, there are two different colorway options: Vinca Blue/Topaz (which I would call purple and orange) and Ceramic Patina/Topaz (turquoise and orange \u2013 the version I tested for this review). Otherwise it looks very similar to the original Supersonic \u2013 a streamlined version of a hair dryer, with a relatively small and lightweight barrel at the top, with most of the weight in the handle.\nWhile Dyson seems to be getting into the habit of adding tiny, largely unnecessary screens to its new releases (looking at you, Airstrait), the Nural has escaped the curse. Instead, it's operated via buttons \u2013 a sliding on-off switch and cool shot button on the handle, and temperature, airspeed and Scalp Protect mode buttons on the barrel. All are small and unobtrusive.\nAt the bottom of the handle is a filter cage. To clean, Dyson recommends snapping the cage off (it's magnetic), soaking it for 30 minutes in soapy water, rinsing and drying. The filter can be wiped with a dry cloth to get rid of anything that may have built up there.\nAt time of writing, the Vinca Blue colorway comes with a cushioned 'presentation case', but there isn't one with the turquoise \u2013 sorry, Ceramic Patina \u2013 option that I tested. I felt both slightly short-changed, and a bit sad, that I couldn't put my Nural to bed like a little prince, but it's not a major issue.\nSettings\nYou have three temperature settings (high, medium, low), plus a cool shot. There are also three airflow speeds \u2013 high (for when you're in a rush, or if you're a generally impatient person), medium (for regular use, if you're not an impatient person) and low (for diffusing).\nAir speed and temperature are adjusted by pressing little buttons on the main barrel of the hair dryer, with three tiny LEDs to indicate which setting you're using. The Nural also has sensors that recognize which attachment is connected. When you snap on each one, it'll automatically swap to your last-used temperature and speed settings, to save you having to manually adjust as you go through your routine.\nAs well as the manual settings, there's the all-new Scalp Protect mode, activated via a button on the barrel with a hair follicle on it. When activated, the Nural uses a Time of Flight sensor to measure how close to your head the hair dryer is, and adjust so it maintains a consistent temperature. So when you have the Nural right up to your scalp, it'll lower the temperature, and if it's further away, it'll increase it. The idea is to minimize heat damage to the hair, was well as helping you avoid burning your scalp if you want to have the dryer right next to your head for precision styling.\nTo hammer home how space-age this feature is, the whole inside of the main barrel will illuminate to indicate the temperature \u2013 bright red for the hottest setting, down to blue for the cool shot. Is it strictly necessary? No. Is it cool? Yes. Is it hard to photograph effectively? Absolutely.\nFinally, there's a Pause Detect function, which uses a motion sensor to identify when you've put the dryer down, and automatically cut the heat and minimize the airflow in response. There's intentionally a slight delay so the Nural doesn't cut out every time you pause slightly mid-style. This function is automatically on, unless you have a diffuser attachment connected.\nAttachments\nAll versions of the Dyson Supersonic Nural come with the full selection of styling attachments. These are magnetic, and snap on and off the barrel of the dryer. They're broadly the same (save for some slight design tweaks) as those included with the original Supersonic, with the exception of the Diffuser, which has been redesigned more thoroughly.\nThe variety of attachments included here mean you can use the Nural to create all sorts of styles. However, there's nothing that will curl naturally straight hair, so if you're looking for that, consider if an Airwrap might be a better choice for you \u2013 our Dyson Airwrap vs Supersonic face-off runs down the differences between the two.\nWave+Curl diffuser\nThis is the large diffuser, for waves and curls. It has been redesigned for the Nural, and can now be used in two ways. The central part, with the prongs, can be removed (it's magnetic) to leave a bowl-shaped attachment that Dyson calls 'Dome mode'.\n'Diffuse mode' (with prongs), is designed to add volume at the root, whereas Dome mode is designed to help define your curls. Dyson recommends you use the diffuser attachments with medium heat and medium airflow. It's the only attachment not to be compatible with Pause Detect.\nGentle air attachment\nThis has crimped edges, and is designed to very slightly diffuse the airflow, for gentler drying compared to using it without. This one is a little confusing \u2013 a Dyson community page states it's 'engineered to be kinder to fine hair and sensitive scalps' but creating a 'gentle, cooler airflow', but then suggests it's used with high heat and high air flow. It is compatible with scalp protect mode.\nStyling concentrator\nLike your standard concentrator, this channels the air into a wide, thin blade, for smooth styles. It's designed for use with high heat and medium airflow, but can also be used with Scalp Protect mode.\nWide-tooth comb\nA broader concentrator, with a comb extension, this attachment detangles your hair as it dries it. Dyson says it's for shaping and lengthening curly or coily hair, and it's designed to be used with high heat and high airflow.\nFlyaway attachment\nThis is for use on dry, straight hair. It uses 'Coanda airflow' \u2013 the same hair-bending phenomenon that powers the Airwrap \u2013 to flatten down flyaways. It's designed to be used with low heat and high airflow.\n- Design score: 4.5 out of 5\nDyson Supersonic Nural review: performance\n- Fast and effective drying; well-designed attachments\n- Scalp Protect mode works well and doesn't impact drying time too much\n- Auto-pause is useful\nIf Dyson really knows how to do one thing well, it's move air about. That's a more impressive specialism than it sounds \u2013 it's what earned Dyson reputation as the brand behind the best vacuum cleaners and the best fans around. And I wasn't surprised to find that the hair drying part of the Supersonic Nural is extremely effective. For rough drying, it gets the job done, and fast.\nBecause of the more compact shape and the fact that most of the weight is in the handle, it's more comfortable to hold, and easier to wield, than a traditional dryer. My only real complaint with the design is that the handle is a touch short for me \u2013 I'm either in danger of accidentally activating the cool shot button or getting my own 'cool shot' to the hand courtesy of the fan grille at the base of the handle.\nAs someone who has a habit of defaulting to the maximum settings on any haircare gadgets, I wasn't sure if Scalp Protect mode would be one of those features I'd end up neglecting, having prioritized extra sleep time over my long-term hair health. However, that hasn't been the case so far.\nI found that there was no appreciable difference in how long it took to rough-dry my hair in this mode compared to my usual blast-it-with-heat approach. This might be partly to do with the fact that the airspeed is so effective that it means you're not relying so much on cranking up the heat to get your hair dry. Scalp Protect mode has become my go-to for whenever I just want to quickly dry my hair.\nWhen comes to styling, the magnetic attachments snap on and off with just the right amount of effort \u2013 not so much it's a struggle, or requires the gripping of anywhere other than the dedicated stay-cool sections of the attachment, and not so little that there's a danger the tool will fall off mid-style.\nThe Attachment Learning tech worked as intended \u2013 in use, the Nural reliably remembered my last-used temperature and airspeed preferences. This feature will be useful for anyone who regularly uses a few different attachments for styling. Like many of Dyson's tech innovations here, it's not essential, but it does remove one of the annoying, fiddly parts of hair styling and streamline the process that little bit more. It's not just a gimmick. Exactly the same goes for the Pause Detect when the dryer is put down.\nI also appreciate Dyson branching out past your standard diffuser-and-concentrator package to offer attachments for different hair types, although it has taken a bit of experimenting to figure out exactly how some of them work and what they're for (this Dyson community page has come in handy). The Flyaway attachment is a standout, using the same hair-bending Coanda airflow effect that the Airwrap is based on to flatten out flyaways and leave a smooth finish with absolutely minimal effort.\nAs someone with naturally slightly curly hair, I was also impressed with the redesigned Diffuser. Regular diffusers leave my hair super-frizzy, but the 'Dome mode', created by removing the central prongs, gave me smoother, more defined curls. (You can see how it works in the video above.)\nOverall, minor niggle about the length of the handle aside, I really have no complaints about the Supersonic Nural's performance. It's by far the best hair dryer I've used.\n- Performance score: 5 out of 5\nShould you buy the Dyson Supersonic Nural?\nAttribute | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | It's wildly expensive, but the tech, build quality and engineering help justify that price. | 4/5 |\nDesign | Compact and easy to wield, with a wide range of useful attachments and some clever tech innovations. | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | Dries quickly and effectively; tech innovations work reliably and help streamline the styling process. | 5/5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want to invest in the best hair dryer around\nIt's not cheap, but it is the best hair dryer I've ever used.

      "text": "Dyson's new hair dryer is a feat of engineering \u2013 but there's one annoying design feature you need to know about if you're thinking of buying one\nCheck your power outlets before you invest\nFor the past few weeks, I've been testing the Dyson Supersonic r. This unusual-looking hair dryer started life as a professional-only tool, before Dyson released a consumer version last month.\nAs you can discover in my Dyson Supersonic r review, I was very impressed with this new addition to the brand's haircare lineup. The light, streamlined design is comfortable to hold and makes it extremely easy to direct the airflow, even in awkward spots like the back of your head. This is the best hair dryer I've tested when it comes to precision styling.\nHowever, there's a design feature that took me by surprise when my review sample arrived, and one I feel duty-bound to inform people of before they decide to invest in one. To achieve that ultra-streamlined look, Dyson has taken some of the mechanics that would usually be in the main body of the hair dryer and put them into the plug. That means that the plug on the Supersonic r is absolutely enormous.\nSupersonic and supersized\nThe extra bulk is distributed in such a way that it just won't work with certain power outlets \u2013 and if that includes the one next to your dressing table, you'll need to either commit to a permanent extension cable or shift your styling location somewhere else. Sure, it's not the worst thing in the world, but it's a frustration that's not ideal if you're spending a lot of money on a premium hair dryer.\nHow big are we talking? Below you'll see it in situ in a power outlet next to the plug for the Dyson Supersonic Nural (the brand's other hair dryer). The main part is 4.8in / 12.2cm long, excluding the wrap at the top of the cord, which you'll also need to make space for. It sticks out horizontally a fair way, too. (I tested the UK version with a three-pin plug; dimensions may vary in other territories.)\nThe whole thing lies flat to the wall, which may fit the sleek Dyson aesthetic, but could make things even worse when it comes to where this plug can fit. If you have power outlets that are low to the floor or sit just above protruding baseboards, you won't be able to plug it in.\nThe Dyson Airstrait has a very similar oversized plug, which also houses some electronics to help reduce the weight of the styling tool in hand. The brand does mention that the plug is larger than usual on the info pages for both products, but it's hidden in the FAQ section, which is collapsed by default. And there are no pictures of the plug that I could see, so it's very easy to miss.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nFor the record, I still think this is a neat innovation from Dyson. It's a clever idea to shift as much of the bulk and weight out of the user's hand as is practical. The wall isn't going to complain about the extra weight, and it makes it more comfortable to use the dryer for long periods. However, for potential buyers, it's worth knowing the full picture before you invest.\nYou might also like...\n- Dyson's new vacuum is as thin as a broom handle and appears to float across the floor\n- Browse the best hair styling tools \u2013 tried and tested\n- Dyson Supersonic vs Airwrap \u2013 do you really need both?\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Dyson Airwrap i.d. looks a lot like the previous version, but has a new automated curl sequence button that's a total game-changer. It takes all the effort and guesswork out of creating curls and, as a result, styles tends to last longer. It's effective as a dryer, too, and the wide range of compatible attachments mean it can work for different hair types, lengths and styling needs. But the main reason to invest (and it's a big investment) is that curl function \u2013 there's just nothing else like it on the market.\nPros\n- +\nEffortless curl creation\n- +\nLonger-lasting results\n- +\nLots of compatible attachments\n- +\nDoubles as a hair dryer\n- +\nLeft and right curls on same barrel\n- +\nExcellent build quality\nCons\n- -\nPremium pricing\n- -\nCurls don't last as long as with tongs\n- -\nResults will vary by hair type\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nDyson Airwrap i.d: two-minute review\nThe Dyson Airwrap i.d. is the latest generation of the brand's ultra-popular multi-styler. Released in 2024, the i.d. introduces one significant upgrade on the original Airwrap: an i.d.curl switch that launches a curling sequence (wrap, curl, cool shot). This simple upgrade is an absolute game-changer \u2013 curling with the Airwrap i.d. feels effortless compared to other auto-wrap stylers I've tested, and the results hold far better, too. It's predictably expensive, but I truly think this is the best hair styler on the market right now.\nIn terms of design, it's the same tube-shaped dryer, onto which various styling tools can be attached. The main ones are the Airwrap barrels, which use the Coanda effect to attract hair, shaping it into a curl as it dries it, without the need for the extreme heat of traditional curling tongs. These are the ones that work with the i.d. curl feature \u2013 and to double-down on what I've said above, the whole thing is now extremely straightforward to use.\nYou don't need to mess around with finding the cool-shot button mid-curl, or take a guess over how long each bit of hair has been wrapped; you just flip the switch, drape a bit of hair over the wand, wiggle it about a bit, and the i.d. will do the rest for you. The timings of the curl sequence are based on information you supply in a companion app (another new development) about your hair type and styling aims. And while nothing has changed with regards to how the Coanda function works, I found my curls remained in place for far longer than they have done using other auto-wrap multi-stylers, purely because the process is automated for you here.\nWith the i.d., Dyson introduced a new tapering barrel alongside the parallel ones of previous models. As before, changing the direction of curl is as simple as twisting the knob at the top of the barrel \u2013 something even today's best Airwrap dupes don't yet offer.\nThe auto-wrap curlers are the main reason to buy an Airwrap, but for styling enthusiasts this styling tool comes with a plethora of compatible add-ons. There are enough drying attachments that mean it can rival today's best hair dryers, too, along with brushes for smoothing or volumizing hair. The variety of attachments on offer also open up the Airwrap to different hair types and lengths \u2013 there's a wide-tooth comb for coils, for instance. However, in terms of effectiveness, I can only really speak to my own experience (I have armpit-length, wavy hair).\nPrice-wise, the Airdrop i.d. is firmly a premium buy; in terms of design, usability and build quality, though, I can't fault it. If you're enthusiastic about styling, like to curl your hair often, and care about long-term hair health, the i.d. is worth the investment. That's the short version; read on for my full Airwrap i.d. review.\nDyson Airwrap i.d. review: price & availability\n- List price: $599.99 / \u00a3479.99 / AU$849\n- Launched: August 2024\nDyson products almost always sit in the premium end of the market, and the Airwrap i.d. is no exception. From Dyson direct, it has a list price of $599.99 in the US, \u00a3479.99 in the UK, and AU$849 in Australia. At time of writing, in the US and UK, you can choose between a \"Straight+ Wavy\" or \"Curly+Coily\" bundle, which comprise different attachments, but the pricing for both remains the same. In Australia, it's just the one standard bundle right now.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe Airwrap i.d. first launched in August 2024, a newer version of the Airwrap (read our Dyson Airwrap (2022) review for more on that model), which Dyson appears to be phasing out.\nThe i.d. certainly isn't cheap, and of course you're paying a bit of a premium for the Dyson name. However, there's nothing else quite like it on the market right now, and I can fault it for either build quality or attention to detail when it comes to the design.\nYou can pick up cheaper dupes, a few of which even arrive with feature auto-wrapping barrels. Of these, the Shark FlexStyle is perhaps the best regarded, and costs $279.99 / \u00a3269.99 / AU$499.99. In the US, you also have the Sharper Image Revel 6-in-1 Multi-Styler at $269.99, while in the UK there's the Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler at \u00a3179.99. The Airwrap i.d. is a clear step above all of these models for build quality and features, however \u2013 none can do clockwise and anti-clockwise curls on the same barrel, and none have an automated curl sequence.\nDyson isn't especially known for its discounts, but they do crop up from time to time, and are well worth taking advantage of if you do spot one.\n- Value for money score: 3.5 out of 5\nDyson Airwrap i.d. specs\nWattage: | 1,300W |\nTemperature settings: | 2 + cool shot |\nSpeed settings: | 3 |\nCord: | 2.7m / 8.5 ft |\nSize w/ no attachments (L x W): | 10.7 x 1.9in / 27.2 x 4.8cm |\nWeight w/ no attachments: | 1.4lbs / 0.6kg |\nAirflow: | 13.5 l/s |\nDyson Airwrap i.d review: design\n- Tube-shaped dryer onto which styling accessories attach\n- Auto-curl sequence button and companion app\n- Extensive range of compatible attachments\nThe Airwrap i.d. is a tube-shaped hair dryer onto which various styling accessories can be attached. Primary among these are the Airwrap barrels, which use the Coanda effect to attract hair so it automatically wraps around the barrel and is shaped into curls as it dries. The attachments twist into place easily, and there's a lock switch on the rear of the dryer to release them when you want to swap in another one. I'll get more into the attachments themselves below.\nOn the dryer itself are three sliding buttons to control the settings. There are cleverly positioned near the top of the barrel, out of the way of your grip, but they're easily accessible during styling. Since they're sliding rather than press buttons, you have much less chance of accidentally changing settings as you hold the barrel, too.\nTwo operate temperature (two heat options plus a cool shot) and windspeed (three options), but the third is probably the most interesting. This switches on the blower, but also operates the i.d. curl sequence, where there Airwrap will cycle through the settings required to create the perfect curl.\nThis function is new with the i.d., and works in conjunction with a companion app (see all the differences between the old and new models in my (Airwrap vs Airwrap i.d. comparison). Here, you complete a quiz about your hair type, length and styling goals, and the Airwrap will set its curl sequence settings based the information you've supplied.\nOn initial completion of the quiz, the Airwrap i.d. will remember your sequence, so you don't need your phone connected or with you to use the i.d. curl sequence. However, if you do have the app open, you can also see the progress of the sequence via a countdown graphic.\nAt the base of the dryer is a grille, behind which sits the filter. You can remove the grille to keep the filter clean \u2013 Dyson recommends doing this regularly to keep the i.d. working as efficiently as possible.\nAttachments\nThe Airwrap i.d. has an extensive range of compatible attachments; in fact, more extensive than any other multi-styler I've come across. Don't expect to get all of these with your styler \u2013 different attachments will be included with different bundles, and some are only available to purchase individually via Dyson's accessory store.\nThe ones that the Airwrap first gained popularity for are the Airwrap barrels. These are curling barrels, but instead of heating up, they blast out directed air in such a way that the hair automatically wraps around them, shaping the hair into curls as the styler dries it. Dyson is the only brand (so far) that enables you to create clockwise and anti-clockwise curls using the same barrel. To switch direction, you twist the cool-touch knob at the top of the barrel.\nThe standard barrel is the same width all the way down, but with the i.d. Dyson has added a tapering barrel that creates curls that are tighter at the top and looser at the bottom.\nMy review model was supplied with a couple of attachments geared towards use of the Airwrap as a hair dryer: the Fast dryer and Dryer+Flyaway smoother. One of the new dryer attachments introduced with the i.d. is the Blade Concentrator, but I didn't test this \u2013 and, as far as I can determine, it isn't included in any bundles right now. Bundles geared towards curly or coily hair will include a diffuser and wide-tooth comb.\nThere are various brush attachments in the range, some soft and some firm, and some for smoothing and some for volumizing, and in different sizes to suit different hair lengths. (I got a soft smoothing brush and large round volumizing brush included.)\nMy review model came with a storage / presentation box, but I'm not sure if this is included with every bundle, so check before you buy.\n- Design score: 5 out of 5\nDyson Airwrap i.d. review: performance\n- Comfortable and efficient to use as a dryer\n- i.d. curl sequence is effortless and delivers long-lasting results\n- Volumizing and smoothing brushes also work very well\nAs a dryer, the Airwrap i.d. works very well. It feels lightweight, well balanced, and it's comfortable to hold and easy to wield.\nThe Fast dryer attachment shifts the flow of air so it's at a right angle to the dryer, rather than shooting straight upwards. This means you can hold your arm in a natural and comfortable position. Some Airwrap-alikes have top sections that pivot to a right angle, for the same purpose. Dyson's attachment is more effective because it also widens the flow of air, and results in a noticeable boost in power.\nOn test, I found the Airwrap plus Fast dryer combo dried by armpit-length hair efficiently. It wasn't quite as speedy as a dedicated hair dryer such as the Dyson Supersonic Nural, but it's more powerful than other multi-stylers I've tested. (I've compared the Dyson Supersonic Nural vs Dyson Airwrap, if you're not sure which one you need.)\nCurling\nBefore testing the Airwrap i.d., I thought the curl sequence might be a bit of a gimmick, but I've done a 180 on that view \u2013 I love it. It makes a massive difference to both the effort required to create curls and their staying power once you've finished styling.\nLet's back up a bit. Setting up the i.d. curl sequence in the app is straightforward. You connect your Airwrap via Bluetooth by switching it on and holding it near your phone, then take a short quiz, which incorporates questions about your hair type, length, experience level and hair goals. Based on this information, the app will create your curl sequence settings.\nThis sequence includes wrapping, curling, and then a cool shot, timed to suit your hair type and needs. If you say you're a beginner, for example, you'll have longer to wrap your hair; if your curls tend to drop quickly, you'll get a longer cool shot. Note, though, that you can manually adjust the timings in the app at any time, if you find they don't suit you.\nTo launch the sequence, you flick the central button upwards, and then just get on with curling. If you're not used to this kind of curling, it will take some getting used to, but once you have it down it's easy. (I was shown how to use this by a Dyson-representative hairdresser, as shown in the photos here, but I also tested it out at home, and managed it just fine on my own.)\nThe i.d. curl switch takes the guesswork and fiddling about out of the equation. I've tested a few of these auto-wrap curlers now and there are two areas they prove most annoying. First, guesstimating the time you've been curling a particular section of hair \u2013 it takes longer than traditional tongs, in the region of 8-10 seconds per section \u2013 and second, locating and running the cool shot on each curl. The i.d. takes care of both.\nIn terms of results, I was super impressed. However, I'll state upfront that curls created in this way generally tend to fall out far sooner than those created with traditional hot tongs (you'll need to decide if the benefits to hair health and less heat damage is worth it to you).\nNevertheless, my curls created with the i.d. lasted far longer than those created with competitor stylers. I think this is all down to the automation features: each section of hair is curled for the same length of time; I'm not forgetting or cutting short any cool shots.\nSmoothing and volumizing\nI also tested out the volumizing and smoothing brushes that came bundled with my Airwrap i.d. Both have been deigned well and I had no complaints about how they worked in use. They clip on easily and feel secure in use, and each has a stay-cool section that you can grip hold of for removal. While in terms of functionality there isn't anything particularly unique here, they work well and help boost the versatility of the multi-styler for those times you don't want a curly look.\n- Performance score: 4.5 out of 5\nShould you buy the Dyson Airwrap i.d.?\nAttribute | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Very expensive, but a clear step above alternatives in terms of both quality and features. | 3.5 / 5 |\nDesign | Comfortable to hold and use, thoughtfully designed, and the range of compatible accessories is extensive. | 5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Results will vary by hair type, but the i.d. curl made creating curls effortless on my long, wavy hair. The results lasted very well, too, although not as long as traditional hot tongs. Also effective as a hair dryer. | 4.5 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou curl regularly\nWhere the Airdrop i.d. shines is for creating curls. The i.d. curl sequence makes the process effortless, with the results more likely to outlast those where you're relying on guessing timings yourself.\nYou care about hair health\nThis type of curling is far better for your long-term hair health over regularly frying your locks with a curling wand.\nYou're a styling enthusiast\nThe Airwrap i.d. isn't cheap, but the quality of the tool and swappable accompanying attachments come into their own for those who love to create different styles. Of all the multi-stylers, the Airwrap probably features the widest range of compatible accessories.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou don't often curl your hair\nIf you don't regularly curl your hair, there's much less of a performance gap between this and the many Airwrap dupes and multi-stylers on the market. If you're only creating blowout styles, for instance, you could save a lot of money by going for a dedicated brush dryer.\nYou're on a budget\nThere are dupes that will do a very similar job, albeit with lower build quality and more effort required from you.\nHow I tested the Dyson Airwrap i.d.\nBefore receiving my review model, I first got a demo of the Airwrap i.d. from a Dyson representative in a salon. I then used the styler over a few weeks at home, testing out the curling system extensively, and using the other attachments too. I compared my experience to other alternatives I've tested, in terms of quality, usability, and how long the styles lasted.\nRead more about how we test\n- First reviewed March 2025\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "How to get your Airwrap curls to hold, plus more top tips for getting the most from your Dyson multi-styler\nInsider advice from a celebrity hair stylist and Dyson ambassador\nThe Dyson Airwrap is an outstanding styling tool. Perhaps the best hair styler around, actually. But with so many attachment options, not to mention a curling method that will be entirely foreign to those more accustomed to traditional hot tongs, figuring out how to actually use it requires a little effort.\nI was offered a chance to get my hair styled professionally using the Airwrap by Chris Long \u2013 a celebrity hairdresser and GB Styling Ambassador for Dyson. I used the opportunity to pick his brains for insider tips; in particular, I wanted to know how to make my Airwrap curls last longer.\nThe good news is that when I got my own one to test for my Dyson Airwrap i.d. review, I was able to mimic Chris' techniques without any difficulty. And if I can do it, I'm confident you can, too. Here's what I learned during my morning at the salon...\nHow to make Airwrap curls last longer\n#1. Don't skip the cool shot\nIf your Airwrapped curls are dropping quickly, Chris has one key piece of advice: \"For long-lasting curls and waves, always use the cold shot button.\" That means using it after every curl, for a decent amount of time, rather than for a couple of seconds whenever you remember.\nDyson recommends around five seconds of cool shot per curl, although you might need a little longer or shorter depending on how well your hair holds styles. The good news here is that, unlike tools that use heat, the Airdrop i.d. isn't going to damage your hair if you hold the cool shot for too long.\nThe newest version of the Airwrap makes this super-easy, because the cool shot is built into the automated i.d. curl sequence, activated by flicking up the button on the front of the dryer. You'll feel the Airwrap become hot, then cold, then drop into a lower-power mode when it's time to release the curl. If you have your companion app open, you can also watch the countdown on your phone's screen.\nIf you have an older version \u2013 the 2022 Airwrap, for example \u2013 then you still have a cool shot function, but you'll have to activate it manually and guesstimate your own timings.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n#2. Get your hair to 80% dry before curling\nWhile you'd only use traditional curling tongs on completely dry hair, the Airwrap works best on hair that's still slightly damp. \"For best results when creating curls, use the Dyson Airwrap i.d. when your hair is around 80% dry,\" says Chris. \"Wet hair holds curls more easily, allowing for tighter, more defined waves when styled with an Airwrap.\"\nHelpfully, you can just use your Airwrap for this bit. With the Quick Dry attachment clipped on, the performance of the Airdrop i.d. rivals some of the best hair dryers on the market. Older versions might come with a different drying attachment, and you can also just use the dryer part with nothing attached at all.\nBeware, if your hair is too wet, curling won't work well either \u2013 the remaining moisture will make your hair heavy, and cause the curl to fall out before it's dried fully. It might require a degree of trial-and-error to get your hair to the correct level of dryness for long-lasting curls.\n#3. Use a pre-styling cream\nChris also emphasized the importance of using a pre-styling cream if you want your curls to stick. He likened it to how you'd use a primer on your face before applying makeup.\nFor my hair, Chris used Dyson's own Chitosan Pre-Style cream. This uses an ingredient derived from oyster mushrooms and is designed to give your curls hold and reduce frizz. Chris smoothed four pumps' worth of it through my armpit-length hair before curling. There are, of course, plenty of alternatives on the market, so use the one that works for your hair.\nFollowing up with a post-style hold product can also help. Chris used Chitosan Post-Style serum to add definition to my curls after he'd finished styling.\n#4. Wiggle the barrel to create tension\nWhen your hair is wrapped around the barrel, you don't want to hold it completely static, but nor do you want to be pulling it all over the place. For the best results, Chris recommends just wiggling it slightly to so the hair stays taut.\nHe explains: \"When using the Dyson Airwrap i.d. with the barrel attachments, the Coanda effect naturally wraps the hair around the barrel. For a tighter curl, gently move the Airwrap back and forth as the hair wraps around the barrel to create more tension and create long-lasting curls.\"\nMore Airwrap tips\nAll clear on how to create Airwrap curls that last? Here's some more advice on how to get the best from your Dyson multi-styler...\n#1. Check you're holding it the right way up\nWhen I first picked up an Airwrap, my instinct was to hold it above my head with the handle at the top. This is apparently incorrect. (I also use traditional curling tongs this way, but it's yet to be confirmed if I'm also making an error there.)\nChris explained that you should hold the handle at the bottom, with the barrel pointing upwards. You'll find the Airwrap is much easier to control this way, not to mention it's less tiring for your arm muscles. It will also give the roots a bit of an extra volume boost.\n#2. Alternate directions for a natural look\n\"If you're starting with straight hair and want a natural curl, use a barrel attachment, and alternate the direction of the curls with each section,\" suggests Chris. \"This variation adds movement and a more effortless, natural appearance.\"\nOne area where the Airwrap stands out from some of the competition is that you can use the same barrel to create clockwise and anticlockwise curls \u2013 you simply twist the knob at the top of the barrel to change direction. To my knowledge, even the best Airwrap dupes still require you to swap over barrels to go from clockwise to anticlockwise curls.\nOne potential issue with the Coanda effect \u2013 the process by which hair is attracted around the barrel using directed air \u2013 is that bits of hair from other curls can fairly easily get sucked into the curl you're currently working on. To avoid too much cross-contamination, Chris sectioned my hair before starting to curl, clipping the rest of the hair out of the way so it didn't get caught up and pulled into the barrel.\n#3. Use the tapered barrel for tighter curls and precise edges\nDyson introduced a new tapered barrel with the i.d. version of the Airwrap (the regular barrels are parallel all the way down). This will give you a tighter curl near the root, so is good if you're after a very curly look. Chris also used it to smooth my frizz-prone baby hairs \u2013 the small tip is great for precision work such as this. Don't hold it too long, though, if you want to avoid the High Court judge look.\n#4. Try the smoothing brush for a polished look\nYour Airwrap will come with other styling attachments, so don't feel you need to stick to just the Airwrap barrels when crafting your look.\n\"For a polished, glamorous style, use the Dyson Airwrap i.d. barrels to curl the hair away from your face on both sides,\" suggests Chris. \"Then, gently brush through the curls using the smoothing brush attachment to transform them into smooth, flowing waves.\"\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "Dyson Supersonic vs Airwrap: do I need both?\nI have a Dyson Airwrap styler and Supersonic dryer \u2013 here's how they compare\nDyson might have made its name in vacuum cleaners, but these days it's also become a force to be reckoned with in the market for haircare tools. The two models that are perhaps best known and most highly regarded are the Dyson Supersonic and the Dyson Airwrap.\nBoth can dry and style your hair, but what's the difference between them? And do you need a Supersonic if you already have an Airwrap (or vice versa)?\nThe Supersonic launched first, in 2016, and was the product that turned Dyson into a serious name in haircare tech. It's primarily a hair dryer \u2013 in fact, one of the very best hair dryers on the market \u2013 but its range of attachments means it can also be used for some styling tasks. Read about the newest version in our Dyson Supersonic Nural review.\nThe Airwrap joined the party in 2018 and is primarily considered a hair curler \u2013 although, again, the wide selection of accompanying accessories mean it can be used to create other looks too (TechRadar ranks it among the best hair styler tools around). Crucially, it can also operate as a hair dryer, allowing it to compete more directly with the Supersonic. Read about the newest version in our Dyson Airwrap i.d. review.\nNeither is especially cheap, and with that in mind, you'll want to be sure about the model you need before investing in either \u2013 or, indeed, both. As TechRadar's Homes editor specializing in haircare gadgets, I have both the Airwrap i.d. and Supersonic Nural in my styling drawer. I've tested both extensively and have a good idea of the strengths and weaknesses of each. Read on for my in-depth comparison of the Dyson Supersonic vs Airwrap.\nDyson Supersonic vs Airwrap specs\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Dyson Supersonic Nural | Dyson Airwrap i.d. |\n|---|---|---|\nWeight: | 1.8 lbs / 0.7 kg | 1.5 lbs / 0.6 kg |\nDimensions (L x W x H): | 4 x 3.1 x 10 inches / 9.8 x 7.7 x 28.8cm | 10.7 x 1.6 x 1.9 inches / 27.2 x 4.1 x 4.8cm |\nWattage: | 1,600W | 1,300W |\nCord: | 2.62m | 2.7m |\nHeat settings: | Low, medium, high, Scalp Protect (auto-mode), Cool shot | 80\u00baC, 100\u00baC |\nSpeed settings: | 3 | 3 |\nAirflow: | 13.3 l/s | 13.5 l/s |\nDyson Supersonic vs Airwrap: price & value for money\n- Both are premium products in their respective categories\n- Supersonic is typically cheaper than the Airwrap\nBoth the Supersonic nor the Airwrap sit firmly in the premium price bracket. Dyson is known for its meticulous engineering and high-quality products, which goes some way to justifying the higher price tags. And despite a proliferation of copycat versions of both, the Airwrap and Sypersonic remain unmatched in terms of quality and performance.\nHere I'll focus on the pricing for the newest versions, when you buy direct from Dyson. You might also find the original Supersonic and Airwrap featured on Dyson's official listings, but prices vary and it's clear both are slowly being phased out. You'll also find these products on third party sites like Amazon.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nHead into Dyson US and you'll find the Supersonic Nural for $499.99 (we've see it discounted as low as $429.99 in the past, but in general Dyson deals aren't that common, and are well worth taking advantage of). At list price, the Airwrap i.d. costs $599.99.\nAt Dyson UK, the Nural has a list price of \u00a3399.99, and the Airwrap i.d. costs \u00a3479.99. It's available in various bundles, but all at the same price. Over Black Friday, though, I saw prices drop to \u00a3399.99.\nAt Dyson Australia the Supersonic Nural costs AU$749, while the Airwrap i.d. has a list price of AU$849.\nBased on the newest versions, the Airwrap i.d. is a fair bit more expensive than the Supersonic Nural. In fact, barring a really good deal, any version of the Airwrap is going to cost you more than a Supersonic. However, which will be better value for money depends on the styles you're hoping to achieve.\nDyson Supersonic vs Airwrap: design\n- Supersonic is predominantly a hair dryer; Airwrap is predominantly a styler/curler\n- Newest versions are the Airwrap i.d. and Supersonic Nural, both released 2024\nLet's start with the Supersonic. There are two main versions: the original model (launched in 2016), and the Supersonic Nural (launched in 2024).\nThe Supersonic shook up the market by delivering a different shape to traditional hair dryers. The barrel is compact and streamlined, and most of the weight is in the handle, making it easy to wield. It also gained popularly for its fast, efficient airflow.\nThe Nural looks pretty much the same, but adds some cool new features. There's a Scalp Protect mode, which uses sensors in the barrel to measure how close the dryer is to your head. It will then get hotter or cooler to maintain what feels like a constant temperature on your scalp, so you can get right up close to your head for styling without frying your locks.\nThe Nural also knows which attachment is clipped on, and remembers your setting preferences for each; it can tell when you've put it down and will drop into low-power mode in response. You can see how the two models compare in more depth in our Dyson Supersonic vs Nural explainer.\nMoving on to the Airwrap. This is essentially a tube-shaped dryer onto which you can add various attachments for achieving different styles. The main focus is the curling barrels, which use a phenomenon known as the Coanda effect to attract the hair around the barrel, shaping it into curls as it dries it \u2013 rather than relying on extreme heat, as traditional curling tongs do.\nWe're now on the third generation model. The first version launched in 2018 and had separate barrels for clockwise and anti-clockwise curls. In 2022, an updated version appeared, introducing more attachment options and \u2013 crucially \u2013 the ability to switch curl direction by twisting a knob at the top of the barrel, rather than having to swap the whole thing over. (You can read about that version in our Dyson Airwrap 2022 review).\nAugust 2024 saw the launch of the current version: the Airwrap i.d., which introduces an i.d.curl switch that automates the wrap-curl-cool shot process, with timings based on information you've supplied about your hair from within a companion app. This is the main upgrade, but Dyson also added some new attachments, including a conical curl barrel.\nFor a closer look at all the differences, head to our Dyson Airwrap vs Airwrap i.d. comparison.\nDyson Supersonic vs Airwrap: tools & attachments\n- Both have a compatible Wide-tooth comb, Flyaway tool and diffuser\n- Airwrap also has curling attachments and round brushes\n- Fast Dryer attachment for Airwrap enables use as a hair dryer\nBoth the Airwrap and Supersonic offer a selection of styling attachments that help increase versatility and broaden the range of styles you can create with each.\nSupersonic attachments\nLet's start with the Supersonic. Here are your attachment options:\n- Gentle air attachment (for light diffusing)\n- Concentrator (for sleek styles)\n- Wide-tooth comb (for coils and tight curls)\n- Flyaway attachment\n- Diffuser (1-part diffuser, included with Supersonic)\n- Wave+Curl diffuser (2-part diffuser, included with Nural)\nThat's a smaller attachment range than the Airwrap, and the main things missing are curling barrels and volumizing brushes.\nAll Supersonics come with the full range of attachments. That makes things simple in terms of buying and comparing prices, but also means that most people will end up with at least one or two attachments they'll never use.\nAirwrap attachments\nThe Airwrap has the broader range of attachments. These include different-sized barrels for curling, smoothing brush options, and round volumizing brush options. There are also various attachments for drying, many of which are similar (or in some cases, the same) as you'll find with the Supersonic dryer.\nNote that not all are automatically included; which tools you get will depend on the Airwrap bundle you've opted for. Here are the current Airwrap attachment options:\nBarrels:\n- 40mm long Airwrap barrel (for curls on longer hair)\n- 30mm long Airwrap barrel (for curls on shorter hair)\n- 20mm Airwrap barrel\n- Conical Airwrap barrel (for tighter curls, closer to the root \u2013 new with i.d.)\nSmoothing brushes:\n- Soft smoothing brush (for fine hair)\n- Firm smoothing brush (for frizz-prone hair)\n- Small soft smoothing brush\n- Small firm smoothing brush\nRound volumizing brush:\n- Small round volumizing brush\n- Round volumizing brush\n- Large round volumizing brush\nDryers:\n- Dryer+Flyaway smoother\n- Fast dryer\n- Blade Concentrator (new with i.d.)\n- Diffuser\n- Wave+Curl diffuser (new with i.d.)\n- Wide-tooth comb (to shape/lengthen coily hair)\nWhile the main machine remains the same, in most territories you can pick up versions with different sets of attachments depending on your hair type \u2013 so there's a Straight+Wavy set, and a Curly+Coily set, for example.\nYou can use the main part of the machine on its own, with no attachments, for drying. However, adding on the Fast dryer attachment amplifies and widens the flow of air, as well as changing the angle to make it more comfortable to use as a dryer.\nThe fact there's also a compatible Dryer+Flyaway smoother and Curl+Wave diffuser allow the Airwrap to compete more directly with the Supersonic. There is technically a concentrator \u2013 the Blade concentrator, introduced with the i.d. \u2013 but at time of updating it's not included in any Airwrap bundles, and it feels like Dyson isn't wholly committed to it as a new addition.\nDyson Supersonic vs Airwrap: performance\n- The Airwrap is better for creating curls or bouncy blow-dry styles\n- The Supersonic is better for rough-drying and smooth/straight styles\nBoth the Airwrap and Supersonic dryer are both excellent at what they do, and I scored both highly in their respective reviews (both got a near-perfect 4.5* out of 5). This aim of this article is to compare the two, so let's focus on which is better for which kind of style. Remember, results will vary by hair length and type. I tested these tools on my armpit-length, wavy hair.\nHair drying\nAs you might expect, the Supersonic is more efficient at drying hair, and the added scalp health features are a welcome bonus. If I need to rough-dry my hair, the Supersonic Nural does the job faster, and is slightly more comfortable to use too, because the proportions are geared specifically towards drying. It also works very well with the Concentrator, Flyaway attachment and Diffuser.\nUsing the Airwrap i.d. on its own as a dryer is less efficient, less comfortable and takes longer. However, the Fast dryer attachment speeds the drying process up significantly, as well as making the Airwrap more comfortable to use in this way (because the flow of air is at right angles to the handle).\nRough drying my hair with the Fast dryer takes a little longer than when using the Supersonic Nural, but not much. If I had especially thick or long hair, I suspect the difference would be more noticeable. You're also not getting the attachment recognition or auto-adjusting temperature features.\nHowever, if I want to dry and add volume at the same time, I reach for the Airwrap, with its brush attachments. There are no round brush attachment options with the Supersonic.\nCurly styles\nIf you have naturally curly hair, theoretically both the Supersonic and the Airwrap will work on your hair type. Both have a compatible two-part Curl+Wave diffuser, and for those with coily hair, both options have a very similar Wide-tooth comb attachment.\nIf you don't have naturally curly hair, the Airwrap is the clear choice. The barrel attachments are designed to create curls on straight hair, or encourage a curlier look on wavy hair. There's no equivalent on the Supersonic.\nStraight / smooth styles\nWhile the Airwrap does have attachments for creating smooth styles (a smoothing/drying attachment, a concentrator), it's really more geared towards curly, voluminous or bouncy styles. That, plus the slightly lower-powered drying means that for smooth, straight styles, a Supersonic is a better choice.\nWhich should I buy?\nBuy the Dyson Supersonic Nural if...\nYou need to dry thick/long hair fast\nThe Supersonic is the more powerful option as a dryer, so a better choice if that's your priority. It also has the Scalp care mode, which is an added bonus here.\nYou want to create smooth, sleek styles\nThere are smoothing brush options with the Airwrap, but the Supersonic Nural's higher power and included Concentrator mean it might be a better choice if you're just wanting to smooth out your hair.\nYou don't want to create curls\nThere's little reason to opt for an Airwrap over a Supersonic if you don't want to create curls, especially since the Supersonic will generally be much cheaper.\nBuy the Dyson Airwrap i.d. if...\nYou want to create curls\nThe Airwrap really shines when it comes to creating curls on straight or wavy hair. The curl barrels and i.d.curl switch make this a breeze. There's no equivalent on the Supersonic.\nYou want to create bouncy blow-dries\nThere are various volume and smoothing brush attachments compatible with Airwrap, designed to add bounce and volume while drying slowly. The Supersonic Nural doesn't have this option.\nYou like to experiment with different styles\nThe Airwrap has a wider selection of compatible attachments, and the ability to deliver a broader range of styles, including curls.\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

The starting price is $599.99 / \u00a3499.99, more than the original Dyson Airwrap released in 2018. Currently, the i.d is only available from Dyson's website, but I predict it will come to third-party retailers soon.\nThe Airwarap i.d differs from the original because it's Dyson's first-ever connected hair tool. It uses Bluetooth wireless technology to sync to a compatible Dyson app, so you can personalize the styler. You'll create a hair profile, and the Airwrap i.d will adapt heat, airflow, and timings to a tailored experience.\nThe new Airwrap comes in two different models, the Curly+Coily and Straight+Wavy. The model highlighted above is the Curly+Coily Airwrap, which includes new attachments such as the Conical Airwrap barrel and a Wave+Curl diffuser, which sets the two models apart. The i.d. also includes all the attachments to the original AirWrap.\n3. Dyson Airwrap Styler Complete\nBest for multiple hair types and styles.\nDimensions: 10.7\" x 1.61\" x 1.89\" | Weight: 1.5 lbs | Power: 1300 W | Attachments: 1.2-inch Airwrap barrel, 1.6-inch Airwrap barrel, firm smoothing brush, soft smoothing brush, round volumizing brush, pre-styling dryer\nThe Dyson Airwrap Complete styler is engineered for multiple hair types and styles and includes six attachments to achieve curls, waves, and smooth, shiny hair. The different attachments include a 1.2-inch and 1.6-inch Airwrap barrel, a firm, smoothing and round volumizing brush, and a pre-styling dryer. The Airwrap barrels allow you to create different size curls and waves, and the three different brushes are engineered to help flat, fine, and frizz-prone hair.\nThe Airwrap Complete Styler retails for $549.99 in the US and \u00a3449.99 in the UK and includes a storage case that protects and stores your Dyson Airwrap styler and its attachments.\n4. Dyson Airwrap Styler Smooth+Control\nBest for frizz-prone hair\nDimensions: 10.7\" x 3.1\" x 1.89\" | Weight: 1.5 lbs | Power: 1300 W | Attachments: 1.2-inch Airwrap barrel, 1.6-inch Airwrap barrel, firm smoothing brush, pre-styling dryer\nThe Dyson Airwrap Styler Smooth+Control is designed for people that have coarse or frizz-prone hair. The Airwrap styler comes with four different attachments, which include the 1.2-inch and 1.6-inch Airwrap barrel, the firm smoothing brush, and the pre-styling dryer. The smoothing brush features firm bristles that are engineered to control frizz-prone hair to create a straighter style with less frizz and fewer flyaways.\nBecause the Dyson Airwrap Smooth+Control lacks the soft smoothing and round volumizing brush, the styler retails for less when compared to the Airwrap Complete and is priced at $499.99 in the US and \u00a3379 in the UK. This Airwrap styler also includes a convenient storage case.\n5. Dyson Airwrap Styler Volume+Shape\nBest for fine, flat hair\nDimensions: 10.7\" x 1.61\" x 1.89\" | Weight: 1.5 lbs | Power: 1300 W | Attachments: 1.2-inch Airwrap barrel, soft smoothing brush, round volumizing brush, pre-styling dryer\nThe Dyson Airwrap Styler Volume+Shape is designed to add volume and shape to fine, flat hair. The Airwrap Styler features four different attachments, which include a 1.2-inch Airwrap barrel, a soft smoothing, and a round volumizing brush. The Airwrap barrel produces voluminous curls or waves, and the soft smoothing and round volumizing brush let you achieve a sleek, straight style or round, bouncy curls.\nThe Dyson Airwrap Styler Volume+Shape does not include the 1.6-inch Airwrap barrel or the firm smoothing brush, so it retails for less when compared to the Airwrap Complete and is priced at $499.99 in the US and \u00a3379 in the UK. The Airwrap styler also includes a storage case and a pre-styling dryer.\nIf you're still undecided about the Dyson Airwrap we've answered some common questions below to help with your buying decision.\nWhat does the Dyson Airwrap do?\nThe Dyson Airwrap is powered by the digital motor V9, which produces air pressure to create an aerodynamic phenomenon called the Coanda effect to attract and wrap hair around the barrel for you. Because the Dyson Airwrap doesn't have to rely on heat alone, the styler avoids extreme temperatures to produce voluminous, effortless curls.\nCan you use the Dyson Airwrap on wet hair?\nOne of the biggest perks of the Dyson Airwrap is that it can be used to help dry and style hair. While you shouldn't use the styler on entirely wet hair, you can rough dry your hair and style it damp so curls last longer.\nIs the Dyson Airwrap worth it?\nWe know the hefty price tag on the Dyson Airwrap can initially cause sticker shock, but there are several reasons for the steep price. The Dyson Styler is built like an appliance and uses an aerodynamic phenomenon called the Coanda effect, where a high-velocity jet of air meets a curved surface and wraps itself around the curve. This produces effortlessly, beautiful curls without extreme heat damage. The Airwrap also is available in three different sets for different hair types and includes a hair dryer and convenient storage case.\nIf you already have damaged hair or want to save time on styling your hair, then the Dyson Airwrap is the perfect tool for you. The Airwrap styler will also outlast other curling irons so you won't have to keep repurchasing the same $70 curling iron every couple of years.\nLearn more about the Dyson Styler with our Dyson Airwrap review and you can also see the best Dyson Supersonic prices and sales.\nYou can also shop for more Dyson discounts with our best cheap Dyson deals and offers that are currently going on.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMackenzie Frazier is the deals editor in the US for TechRadar at Future plc.

      "text": "Dreame, please fix these issues with your hair styler gadget \u2013 I'd love to be able to recommend it as an Airwrap alternative\nSo much potential\nI've tried out plenty of Dyson Airwrap alternatives; some good, some not so good. But the one I was most excited to get my hands on was the but the Dreame AirStyle Pro. I'd seen it demoed at a press event, my teammate had tried it out briefly at IFA and loved it, and when my test sample arrived my first impressions were great. I thought it was a shoo-in for my best hair styler roundup.\nI've also had great experiences with this brand. It's relatively new, but everything I've tested from Dreame has been excellent. The Dreame R20 sits at the top of our best cordless vacuum guide, and its X50 Ultra Complete is our favorite premium robot vacuum. And that's just a couple of examples.\nSo my expectations for the AirStyle were high. Unfortunately, I ended up rather underwhelmed. Let's start with the good bits. The dryer part is well-designed \u2013 it's comfortable to hold, well-balanced, and looks and feels high quality. The controls are intuitively placed and out-of-the-way enough that it's unlikely you'll press them accidentally, and the spring-loaded slider cool shot is especially well thought-out.\nThere's a great range of attachments, including those all-important auto-wrapping curl barrels (the innovation that made the original Airwrap so popular), and three different brushes for smoothing and volumizing.\nDreame has also added a Flyaway attachment (positioned to rival the one included with the Dyson Airwrap i.d.) and a smart-looking Fast dry attachment that blasts the air out at a right-angle to the handle, for comfortable drying. All are packaged up neatly in a stylish storage box.\nThe price is right too: it's still a bit of an investment, but almost exactly the same as its main Airwrap-alike competitor, the Shark FlexStyle.\nWhat's the problem?\nSo far, so good \u2013 so why did the Dreame AirStyle Pro end up being the biggest disappointment of my product reviewing year? The first (and most significant) problem is that it just doesn't get hot enough.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nI don't have especially long or thick hair (collarbone-length, and fine strands but quite a lot of them, for the record), but it couldn't get it dry. I spent several minutes waving the AirStyle ineffectually around my head before giving up and switching to a dedicated hair dryer \u2013 I just don't have that kind of time available in the mornings, okay?\nIt was so lukewarm that I wondered if I'd been sent a faulty review model, but not so \u2013 looking at Dreame's website reveals the two heat settings as 122\u00baF / 50\u00baC (medium) and 176\u00baF / 80\u00baC (high). In comparison, the Dyson Airwrap i.d.'s maximum heat setting is 194\u00baF / 90\u00baC.\nThe lack of heat is frustrating when you're in a rush and need to dry your hair efficiently, but it has a bigger problem for this kind of styler, too. You need a certain amount of initial heat to 'set' styles, and I found my curls seemed to drop much more quickly when created using the AirStyle versus other auto-wrap curlers I've tested \u2013 even cheap ones like the Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro.\nThe second problem is that the tools don't attach securely enough. It's a simple twist mechanism, with no 'click' and no release switch. That's fine for something like the Fast dryer attachment, but with brush tools that require twisting as part of the styling process, I fairly regularly ended up with a dryer in hand and a brush hanging tangled in my hair.\nDespite these frustrations, I'm hesitant to give up on Dreame's multistyler just yet. It just has so much promise. When (or if \u2013 nothing is confirmed yet) a new version arrives, I just hope these two problems will have been addressed.\nYou might also like...\n- Dyson's new Airwrap is smaller and more powerful, but it's the new straightening attachment that really turned my head\n- I tested 3 Airwrap dupes, and I'm more convinced than ever that Dyson's styler is the GOAT\n- Dreame D9 Max Gen 2 review: a budget-friendly robot vacuum that actually does as it's told\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "I tested 3 Airwrap dupes, and I'm more convinced than ever that Dyson's styler is the GOAT\nWhen it comes to effortless styling, Dyson has the market wrapped up\nDyson changed the multistyler game when it launched its Airwrap. So much so, that it wasn't long before a wave of copycat stylers began to appear on the market. I loved the newest version of this gadget when I tested it out for my Dyson Airwrap i.d. review, but there's no denying it's silly expensive.\nSo I got my hands on a selection of cheaper alternatives, to see how they matched up and if I could get similar results without clearing out my bank account. Unfortunately, I have bad news for the bargain-hunters.\nWhile today's best Airwrap dupes can now replicate the functionality of the original model from 2018, Dyson has been busy upping its game since then \u2013 the current Airwrap i.d. includes features you just can't find elsewhere, and elevate it head-and-shoulders above the competition. It's hands-down the best hair styler I've used, and if you can afford it, the Airwrap i.d. is worth the investment.\nAirwrap rewind\nBefore I tell you why, let's rewind slightly. What makes an Airwrap so worthy of copying? It's essentially a tube-shaped hair dryer onto which different styling attachments can be clipped.\nThe original launched in 2018, and the reason it garnered so much attention is because it offered a new way to create curls. Rather than use the extreme heat of traditional tongs to style hair, the Airwrap uses something called the Coanda effect to attract and wrap hair around its barrel automatically, shaping it into curls as it finishes drying it.\nAt that time, the alternatives didn't offer Coanda-powered, auto-wrapping curl barrels, and as such struggled to really compete. However, modern stylers \u2013 including the Shark FlexStyle, Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 and Dreame AirStyle Pro (review in progress) I've tested \u2013 do all offer this tech.\nIn fact, they do it pretty well. Functionally, a styling tool such as the FlexStyle works very similarly to the original Airwrap to create curls. So why wouldn't I buy one?\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMay I see some i.d. please?\nThe biggest reason is because Dyson has added two new capabilities to its Airwrap since that original model, and both are game-changers. The first innovation \u2013 introduced in the Airwrap (2022) model \u2013 is the ability to create clockwise and anticlockwise curls on the same barrel, rather than two separate ones, simply by twizzling a knob at the top.\nThe ability to switch direction creates more natural-looking curls with less effort. I'm not aware of any dupes that can do this \u2013 when testing the alternatives, I found myself sticking to one direction of curl on one side of my head, and the other on the other side, just because I couldn't be bothered to switch barrels.\nThe second innovation is i.d. curl, introduced with the 2024 Airwrap i.d. Flick the switch on the front of the styler and it will launch an automated curl sequence: a few seconds of lower-powered air to get the hair in place; a few more seconds of hot air to create the curl; then a cool shot to set the style. The exact timings are based on your specific hair type, set via a short quiz you complete in the companion app.\nOn test, I found that not only did this feature make for a fantastically low-effort styling session, it also meant a big improvement in the results. My curls created using the Airwrap i.d. looked more uniform and lasted far longer than those created using any of the other alternative stylers \u2013 something I attribute entirely to the fact that the routine is personalized to my styling needs and hair type.\nIt's a pain to have to clock-watch or guesstimate timings when creating your curls. The same applies to the cold shot \u2013 I know it's the best way to make Airwrap curls last, but what are the chances of even remembering to cold shot each curl amidst styling a whole head of hair? No chance at all. A very patient and conscientious home-styler with plenty of time on their hands might be able to achieve the Airwrap's results with a cheaper, less automated gadget, but I'm willing to bet most of us don't fall into that camp.\nThe other reason for not wanting to stray from my beloved Airwrap i.d. is that I simply feel it wins out over rival brands for build quality and attention to detail.\nWith the FlexStyle model, for example, I found the texture of the barrels a little too rough, so hair would snag when trying to wrap or release. And on the Revamp model, the location of the buttons makes it all too easy to accidentally change the settings mid-style. While the Dreame gadget I'm currently reviewing looks the part, the attachments don't clip on securely, and can twist off while you're trying to wrangle your locks into place.\nSuch issues might not be deal-breakers on their own \u2013 especially on a low-cost styler \u2013 but here's the thing: some of the rival tools aren't especially low-cost. They're cheaper than the Airwrap i.d., but they're far from budget \u2013 the FlexStyle has a list price of $279.99 / \u00a3269.99 / AU$499.99, while the Dreame Airstyle Pro costs $399.99 / \u00a3299 / AU$599. Not exactly pocket change.\nIn contrast, the Airwrap i.d. is $599.99 / \u00a3479.99 / AU$849. That does represent a big price-hike, but if you can get it on a deal, it's well worth the extra investment.\nYou might also like...\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "Dyson's next-gen Airwrap is smaller, lighter, and more powerful, but it's the new straightening attachment that really turned my head\nThe supreme multi-styler just got even better\n- New Dyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x is smaller and lighter but more powerful\n- Introduces attachment memory and a cool new straightener attachment\n- On sale on 8 July in the US, and 'September' in the UK\nDyson has launched a new version of its Airwrap, and it looks better than ever. The new Airwrap Co-anda 2x is smaller and lighter, but offers more air pressure and more power. The accessories have also been upgraded to amp up the styler's versatility.\nThere's now attachment recognition, and an all-new AirSmooth attachment that looks particularly interesting for those looking to create sleek, straight styles.\nI reviewed the Dyson Airwrap i.d. and rated it the best hair styler on the market. I haven't tested this one yet, but if I were a betting woman, I'd say Dyson is about to dethrone its own styler with the upgraded version.\nTo create that smaller and lighter build, the Airwrap Co-anda 2x has had its internal mechanics completely redesigned, with a new Hyperdymium 2 motor. Two cool facts about this motor are that it can spin nine times faster than an F1 car engine, and that the wire powering the motor is just 90 microns wide \u2013 which is as thin as a strand of human hair. It can apparently deliver twice the air pressure and 30% more power than the Airwrap i.d., without increasing noise levels, which should mean faster drying, more efficient hair wrapping, and sleeker straightening.\nYou're still getting the i.d.curl feature, which was such a game-changer on the Airwrap i.d. It enables you to launch a personalized curl sequence with the flick of a button. Here, the barrels can also apparently detect when hair is fully wrapped, and it's time to start the i.d. curl sequence.\nOverall, it looks like the gap between Dyson and other Airwrap-alikes is widening \u2013 today's best Airwrap dupes can't even offer clockwise and anti-clockwise curls on the same barrel, let alone automating the entire process for you. However, I am slightly perturbed to see that Dyson seems to have redesigned the buttons here, swapping the Airwrap i.d.'s chunky, easy-to-use buttons for the fiddly, unnecessarily small switches found on the Dyson Supersonic r hair dryer.\nIt's all in the accessories\nAs I said up top, the accessories are where it's really at, so let's take a closer look at them. Previous versions of the Airwrap were mainly geared towards curling, but this latest iteration amps up the versatility and acts more like a true 'multi-styler'.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nFirstly, the attachments now contain RFID sensors that enable the dryer part to recognize which one is clipped on. Then it'll automatically adjust to the optimal temperature and windspeed settings (the first time) or your last-used settings (thereafter) with each attachment. It's precisely the same as on the Supersonic Nural and Supersonic r hair dryers, where I found it massively helped to streamline the styling process, making it easier than ever to swap between tools.\nSecond, there's a new attachment geared specifically towards straightening: the AirSmooth2x, which looks like it's been inspired by the wet-to-dry Dyson Airstrait. Two unheated plates clamp together and blast the hair between them with air, with the tension helping smooth and straighten the strands as they dry. The plates will automatically unclamp once you reach the bottom of the hair.\nDyson says the Airwrap Co-anda 2x is the only multi-styler on the market to come with six attachments included with purchase. I'm not sure that's true, but there is certainly a more comprehensive range than you'd usually get.\nThere are two bundles to choose from, with different attachments to suit different hair types:\nStraight + Wavy bundle:\n- 30mm curling barrel\n- 40mm curling barrel\n- Anti-snag loop brush\n- Round volumizing brush\n- AirSmooth attachment\n- Fast dryer\nCurly + Coily bundle:\n- 40mm Co-anda curling barrel\n- Anti-snag loop brush\n- Round volumizing brush\n- Tension comb\n- Wave+Curl diffuser\n- Fast dryer\nYou can pick up most of the attachments individually if the one you want isn't included in your chosen bundle. Also available individually is a 20mm barrel for tighter curls (interestingly, Dyson seems to have already done away with the tapering barrel it introduced with the Airwrap i.d.).\n\u201cTraditional stylers can damage hair, but we have always focused on developing tools that protect hair health whilst enhancing without compromising precision and/or performance,\" comments brand founder James Dyson. \"We harness our expertise in motors, fluid dynamics, and materials to continually improve... It\u2019s about creating exciting long-lasting styles using smarter, more efficient technology.\"\nPrice & availability\nThe Co-anda 2x is actually already available in some international markets, including Korea. However, it was unveiled in the US and UK today (July 1). Both markets will offer the styler in Ceramic Pink or Jasper Plum, and the option of Straight+Wavy or Curly+Coily bundles (priced the same).\nIt will go on sale in the US from July 8 at Dyson.com and Sephora.com for $699.99. For comparison, the i.d. has a list price of $599.99.\nUK shoppers will have a bit longer to wait: the Dyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x will go on sale in September with a list price of \u00a3579.99 (compared to \u00a3479.99 for the i.d.).\nYou might also like...\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

Rather than applying extreme heat with a traditional curling tong, this tool harnesses a phenomenon called the coanda effect to cause hair to wrap itself around the barrel, shaping it and setting it into curls using just air. The i.d. version adds an i.d.curl switch that launches an automated curling sequence (wrap > curl > cool shot), taking all the guesswork out the process and making it absolutely effortless.\nWhere the Airwrap i.d. really shines is when creating curls, but there's a wide range of other compatible tools that increase its versatility. It can be used as just a hair dryer, and there are various brush attachments for creating bouncy blow-dries, a diffuser and wide-tooth comb attachments for curls and coils, and a flyaway smoother, amongst other things.\nThe sticking point for many will be the price \u2013 there's no getting around the fact that the Airwrap i.d. is extremely expensive. There are other multistylers in this list that also use the coanda effect to create curls (see the Revamp at #2 and Shark at #5) but none that can create clockwise or anticlockwise curls on the same barrel, and none that offer an automated curl sequence.\nRead our full Dyson Airwrap i.d. review\nThe best affordable multi-styler\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler is the best budget multi-styler we've tested, as well as being one of the best Airwrap dupes if you can't stretch to the real thing (it's UK only \u2013 US shoppers should hop down to the slightly pricier Shark FlexStyle at #5).\nLike many modern multi-stylers, the design combines a tube-shaped dryer \u2013 the top of which pivots for more comfortable drying \u2013 and various attachments for different styling tasks. These include the all-important auto-wrapping curl barrels, which we found worked just as well as any we've tried (although you will have to manually swap them over when you want to switch from clockwise to anticlockwise curls, unlike on the Airwrap).\nThere's a decent selection of attachments \u2013 the two auto-wrap curl barrels, a concentrator, flat paddle brush, large oval bristle brush with ceramic barrel and a round barrel with retractable bristles. It's only the last of these that our tester was unimpressed with, and we particularly like the large bristle brush for adding volume. Other brands' efforts have a wider selection of compatible attachments, but most bases are covered here, with the notable exception of a diffuser.\nAlthough it understandably doesn't feel ultra-premium, the build quality is decent and functions as intended \u2013 all the attachments clip on and off easily and feel secure in use, for example. The helpful addition of an easily accessible \"pause\" button means you can remove the wand without disturbing your curls. In fact, our only real complaint was that it was a little too easy to accidentally change the settings mid-style.\nIn general, Revamp is worth checking out if you're looking for a cheap multi-styler. The even more affordable Progloss appears in our list at #6.\nRead more in our Revamp Dynamic Radiance Pro Blow Dry 7-in-1 Ionic Air Styler review\nThe best hair brush dryer\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're on a tighter budget and want something that'll help you create bouncy blow-dries, Revlon's Pro Collection One Step is the best brush dryer we've tried. It's not much to look at, but it really delivers when it comes to results \u2013 and it's extremely affordable too.\nThis kind of hair styler tool dries and shapes your hair at the same time. It's quite heavy, but on test our reviewer found it was so efficient that the extra weight didn't really matter. There are just two drying settings: lower powered and less hot, or higher powered and hotter. The higher setting created an irritating noise, but our tester found the lower setting was powerful enough that she never had to use anything else. The large barrel enables you to tackle large sections at a time, and its oval shape makes it easy to create volume at the root.\nAlthough the design isn't perfect, the results more than made up for any flaws: the Revlon Pro Collection One Step consistently left our reviewer's hair sleek, bouncy and voluminous. If you're seeking more versatility \u2013 including the ability to create curls \u2013 there are plenty of multi-stylers in this list to choose from. But for bouncy blow-dries on a budget, this is the tool for you.\nRead more in our Revlon Pro Collection One Step Dryer and Volumiser review\nThe best straightening tool\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Dyson Airstrait uses an angled blade of focused airflow to dry and straighten at the same time \u2013 meaning you can use it on wet hair. Its design has an 80s sci-fi vibe and swaps the usual straightener hot plates for unheated panels, with vents to deliver the air.\nAt 1.18lb / 536g, the Airstrait is heavier than a traditional straightener, but it makes light work of drying/straightening hair, with our reviewer able to achieve both in 10 minutes, less than half the time it would take to dry and straighten her hair usually. It has some neat features too: one that adjusts the volume of airflow when hair is in it, and another that cuts airflow when its arms have been open for more than three seconds.\nOur reviewer found that there was little-to-no hair snagging or sizzling and that the Airstrait was able to dry segments of her hair with just one pass. Its results were natural-looking straight hair rather than pin straight, however, and the Airstrait can't get right up to the root, so may not be as effective for those with tight curls.\nTalking of curls, what the Airstrait is not so good at is creating them \u2013 for that, you'll want the Airwrap (#1) or another multi-styler. However, if you have wavy or slightly curly hair and are looking for a styling tool that will help you smooth things out without damaging your locks, the Airstrait would make an excellent choice. It's expensive, but top quality, and there's nothing else like it on the market right now.\nRead our full Dyson Airstrait review\nAnother versatile hair styler\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Shark FlexStyle Air Styling & Hair Drying System is a hair tool with a range of useful attachments for creating different styles. It's Shark's answer to the Airwrap (#1); it comes with very similar auto-wrapping curl barrels, which create curls using directed air, resulting in less heat damage than traditional tongs. However, unlike with the Airwrap, you'll need to manually swap over the barrels to create clockwise and anti-clockwise curls, and there's no automated curl sequence.\nYou can also use the FlexStyle as a dryer \u2013 the pivotable top section makes it comfortable to hold and easy to direct the airflow in this mode. Plus, there are brush tools, a concentrator and a diffuser that can be snapped on for different looks. In some countries you can build your own bundle, and choose only the attachments you'll actually use, which is a neat option.\nPrice-wise, it's much more affordable than an Airwrap, although still not super-cheap. The quality is fine (the black version looks and feels more premium than the beige one) but it's still worth keeping an eye out for a deal if you decide this is the hair tool for you. Shark loves a sale, so you shouldn't have to wait too long.\nRead more in our Shark FlexStyle review\nThe best cheap multi-styler\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Revamp Progloss Airstyle 6-in-1Air Styler DR-1250, or the Revamp Progloss, is a very budget-friendly multi-styler that comes with with six attachments \u2013 a wide-bristle brush, a paddle brush and a rotating hard bristle brush, which is designed for creating soft waves. There's also a conical attachment for creating curls, a drying attachment and a diffuser.\nThe dryer works well, drying our reviewer's hair in just over four minutes. And in our tests, the smaller barrel brush and paddle brush were particularly suited to fine hair. The larger rotating brush worked well in that it was easy to wind hair around the barrel, but the barrel itself was too wide for clearly defined waves on shoulder length hair, suggesting this tool may work better with longer hair. Elsewhere, our reviewer found it hard to grip the air styler when creating curls, due to the length of the handle.\nThe Progloss was also rather noisy at 80dB. Saying that, we'd recommend the Progloss to those who want to create a variety of styles without spending big.\nRead more in our Revamp Progloss Airstyle 6-in-1Air Styler DR-1250 review\nHow to choose a hair styler tool\nWhen choosing a hair styler, you first need to consider what you want to achieve. Are you looking to create waves, straight locks or to enhance or define existing curls? If there's only one style you know you'll want to create most of the time then you may want to choose a hair styler dedicated to that function, or if you want to be able to mix up styles then a multi styler may be better for you.\nAlso think about your hair type \u2013 some tools are better suited to some hair types than others. We've indicated where this is the case in our list.\nIt's also worth considering design and portability, do you need something that will travel easily or will your tool likely stay in one place? Do you have the space to keep several accessories and a large hair styler tool or do you need something that's relatively compact? Is an included carry case important to you?\nBudget will also likely play a key part in your decision. The price of hair stylers ranges from relatively inexpensive 2-in-1 hair brush dryers to multi-stylers, which vary in price, with Dyson being the most expensive.\nWhat is the best hair styling tool brand?\nThere are a number of brands in the hair styling tool market. Dyson is top of the range in terms of price and quality, but elsewhere there's Shark, Revlon, Remington, BaByliss, plus GHD and T3.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRosie is deputy editor of TechRadar's sister design site, Creative Bloq.

  "argos_summary": "Dreame has launched the Dazzle hair styler in the US, currently priced at $249.99, making it a competitive alternative to Dyson's Airwrap. The Dazzle features attachment recognition, allowing it to automatically adjust temperature and speed settings based on the attachment used, and offers higher heat settings compared to its predecessor, the AirStyle Pro. While it presents good value for money, it lacks some advanced features found in the latest Dyson models, such as automated curl sequences and the ability to create both clockwise and anticlockwise curls on the same barrel.",
