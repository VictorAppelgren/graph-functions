  "title": "Top 5 Social Security questions most Americans get wrong",
  "description": "A recent AARP survey revealed dangerous knowledge gaps that could lead some people to make poor decisions about when to apply \u2014 or to apply at all.",
  "content": "If you're retired or nearing retirement, you probably know some people claiming Social Security benefits, and you might also have a sense of how the program works. You pay into it your entire career, and then when you're older, you start collecting checks for the rest of your life.\n\nThe finer points of the program are often fuzzier, though. A recent AARP survey revealed dangerous knowledge gaps that could lead some people to make poor decisions about when to apply \u2014 or whether to apply at all. Correcting these misconceptions, including the five listed below, is key if you hope to get the most out of the program.\n\n1. What's the earliest age you can claim benefits?\n\nOnly 40% of those surveyed knew that the earliest you can claim Social Security is age 62 \u2014 and even this is a bit of an oversimplification. You have to be 62 for the entire month to be eligible, and in the Social Security Administration's eyes, your birth month only counts if you were born on the first or second. If not, you don't qualify until the month after your birth month.\n\nIt's also important to note that claiming at 62 is considered claiming early because you're under your full retirement age (FRA) \u2014 more on that below. This means you could face an early claiming benefit reduction of up to 30% for signing up then. However, it could still be the right choice for you if you have no other way to cover your living expenses or if you have a short life expectancy.\n\n2. What's the age that maximizes your monthly benefit?\n\nEven fewer people know how long they have to wait to maximize their monthly benefit claim. Only a quarter of respondents correctly chose age 70 as the age when you qualify for your largest monthly benefits.\n\nMost people guessed younger than this. This is dangerous because you might short-change yourself by claiming earlier, believing you couldn't grow your checks by waiting longer.\n\nThinking you have to wait past 70 to qualify for your maximum checks could prove even more costly. Your benefits don't grow any more once you reach 70, so you should definitely sign up by then at the latest. Otherwise, you're just costing yourself money.\n\n3. What is your full retirement age (FRA)?\n\nYour FRA is the age when you qualify for your full Social Security benefit based on your work history. If you claim in the month you reach your FRA, you don't face any early claiming penalties, and you also don't get any delayed retirement credits that boost your benefit.\n\nMore than one-third of survey respondents believed that FRA is 65, while another quarter said they didn't know. The 65 guess doesn't come out of nowhere. FRA used to be 65 for many years. But in the 1980s, the government made changes to the program to avoid insolvency, including raising the FRA for younger adults.\n\nIf you were born in 1960 or later, your FRA is 67. However, some older adults have slightly younger FRAs.\n\n4. Can you claim Social Security benefits on an ex-partner's work record?\n\nWhen asked about whether a divorced person could claim Social Security benefits on their ex's work record after a 10-year marriage, half of the respondents either answered incorrectly or didn't know. The truth is that you can, but the 10-year marriage is key.\n\nPeople who get divorced before crossing the 10-year mark are not eligible to claim benefits on their ex's work record. You also aren't eligible to do this if you remarry. However, in this scenario, you could become eligible based on your new spouse's work record. If your spouse remarries but you don't, this doesn't affect your eligibility for an ex-spousal benefit. Claiming on your ex's work record will not prevent their new spouse from receiving checks either.\n\n5. Will you get back the money you lost to the Social Security earnings test?\n\nThe Social Security earnings test applies to those claiming checks before their FRA while they're still working. If you're under your FRA for all of 2025, you lose $1 for every $2 you earn over $23,400. If you'll reach your FRA this year, you lose $1 for every $3 you earn over $62,160, if you earn this much before your birthday.\n\nFew survey respondents understood that this loss, while potentially problematic in the short term, isn't forever. When you reach your FRA, the Social Security Administration increases your checks to make up for the amount it kept from you before.\n\nIf any of the answers above surprised you, it might be time to rethink your Social Security claiming strategy. You may prefer to claim at a different time to get more money or avoid the earnings test, for example. If you have any questions about how the above rules apply to your specific situation, you can always contact the Social Security Administration for more information.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

      "text": "Spousal benefits are Social Security benefits that are based on your spouse\u2019s work record instead of your own. In some circumstances, you\u2019re eligible for spousal benefits even if you\u2019ve divorced.\nYour Social Security retirement benefit is typically based on your 35 highest-earning years of work. But, if your spouse earned significantly more or your work history is limited, you may get more money from spousal benefits. Read on to learn when you qualify for spousal benefits and how Social Security calculates your payments.\nWho qualifies for Social Security spousal benefits?\nTo be eligible for spousal benefits if you\u2019re currently married, all three of the following must apply:\n- You\u2019ve been married for at least a year.\n- You\u2019re at least 62, or you\u2019re caring for your spouse\u2019s disabled child who is younger than 16.\n- Your spouse currently receives retirement benefits.\nIf you\u2019re at least 62 and your spouse hasn\u2019t started receiving benefits yet, you can take your own retirement benefit and then claim their higher benefit once they file. This is a common Social Security planning strategy for couples.\nHowever, you can\u2019t take spousal benefits and switch to your own higher benefit unless one of the following applies:\n- You were born before Jan. 2, 1954.\n- You qualify for Social Security disability benefits.\n- You care for your spouse\u2019s child who\u2019s younger than 16 or disabled.\nSocial Security will give you either your own retirement benefit or spousal benefits, but not both.\nAs with retirement benefits, spousal benefits are taxable if your income exceeds certain thresholds. It\u2019s important to plan for your taxes in retirement, no matter which type of benefit you expect to receive.\nCalculating Social Security spousal benefits\nSpousal benefits are based on your spouse\u2019s primary insurance amount, which is the amount they\u2019re eligible for at full retirement age (FRA). Depending on how old you are when you start Social Security, you can receive 32.5% to 50% of your spouse\u2019s benefit.\nIf you wait until your full retirement age \u2013 which is 67 if you were born in 1960 or later \u2013 you\u2019ll qualify for the 50% maximum. But if you claim as soon as you\u2019re eligible at 62, you\u2019d only receive 32.5% of their full benefit.\nWhen you take your own retirement benefits, you can earn 8% delayed retirement credits for each year you wait past your full retirement age until you reach your benefit cap at age 70. However, you can\u2019t earn delayed retirement credits when you\u2019re taking spousal benefits. You\u2019ll receive your maximum benefit once you reach full retirement age.\nYou also won\u2019t earn extra if your spouse waits past their full retirement age. The rules are different for surviving spouses, as we\u2019ll discuss shortly.\nIf you take spousal benefits, you won\u2019t affect the benefits your husband or wife receives. Their benefit is based solely on their primary insurance amount and when they claim.\nIn the past, couples often maximized their Social Security by taking spousal benefits first and then switching to their own retirement benefits to get credit for delaying. But the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 eliminates this option unless you were born on or before Jan. 2, 1954, you have a disability and also qualify for spousal benefits, or you care for your spouse\u2019s child who is younger than 16 or has a disability.\nDivorced spouses\nIf you\u2019re a divorced spouse, you may be eligible for spousal benefits. To qualify as a divorced spouse, the following rules apply:\n- Your marriage must have lasted at least 10 years.\n- You must have been divorced for at least two years.\n- You can\u2019t be currently married.\nBenefits for ex-spouses are the same as benefits for current spouses. The maximum divorced spouse benefit is 50% of your former spouse\u2019s primary insurance amount if you wait until full retirement age. If you claim early, you\u2019ll receive as little as 32.5%.\nTo receive divorced spouse benefits, both you and your ex need to be at least 62. However, unlike with benefits paid to current spouses, divorced spouse benefits don\u2019t require your ex to actually be receiving benefits. As long as they\u2019re at least 62 and meet Social Security\u2019s minimum of 40 work credits, you can take spousal benefits if you meet the other requirements.\nIf you qualify for retirement benefits based on your own work record, Social Security will use your earnings to determine your benefits. Then your former spouse\u2019s record will be used to qualify you for a bigger benefit if applicable.\nAs with spousal benefits, if a former spouse claims Social Security using your record, your benefits won\u2019t be affected. There\u2019s also no effect on your current spouse\u2019s Social Security.\nSocial Security survivor benefits\nWhen your spouse dies, you may be eligible for survivor benefits. You may also be eligible for your ex-spouse\u2019s survivor benefits if you were married for at least 10 years or you care for their child who\u2019s younger than 16 or disabled.\nSurvivor benefits are as much as 100% of the benefit the deceased worker was receiving when they died. If the person died before claiming benefits, the survivor benefit is based on their primary insurance amount.\nTo qualify for the full benefit, you still have to wait until your full retirement age. However, you can claim benefits as early as age 60 (or 50 if you\u2019re disabled). If you claimed survivor benefits as soon as you\u2019re eligible at age 60, you\u2019d only receive 71.5% of your late spouse\u2019s benefit. Surviving spouses or ex-spouses who are caring for a child younger than 16 or who has a disability can receive 75% of the deceased worker\u2019s benefit.\nIf you remarry before age 60 (or 50 if you have a disability), you won\u2019t qualify for survivor benefits. However, if you remarry after age 60 (or 50 if you\u2019re disabled), remarrying won\u2019t jeopardize your survivor benefits.\nThe bottom line on spousal benefits\nSpousal benefits can boost your Social Security if your spouse earns significantly more than you. However, if you\u2019re employed for most of your working years, you may still qualify for a bigger benefit on your own. If you\u2019re wondering how much you\u2019d qualify for on your own record or your spouse\u2019s, you can create a my Social Security account to estimate your benefits and kickstart your retirement planning."

      "text": "The thought has occurred to most people of a certain age: Why not keep working and collect Social Security early? I'll make a good income, right?\nWrong. Since 1937, recipients have been subject to a Social Security retirement earnings test that cuts benefits for people who make above a certain amount. Read on to learn more about this rule and how it might affect your retirement plans.\nHow Social Security works\nHow does Social Security work?\nSocial Security was established to combat an epidemic of poverty among older Americans during the depths of the Great Depression. According to the Social Security Administration, roughly two-thirds of older Americans who lived alone fell below the poverty line. The first recipient of Social Security was Ida May Fuller, a Vermont woman who received a $22.54 check in January 1940 (almost $499 in 2023 dollars after adjusting for inflation).\nThe program is funded by a payroll tax. Employers and workers each pay 6.2% of their wages to a taxable maximum of $176,100 in 2025; self-employed workers pay 12.4%.\nIn 1940, there were 42 workers for every retired person. Because of longer life expectancies and a decline in the U.S. birth rate, the ratio is now 2.7 workers for every retired person, leading to calls for reforming the system to ensure that people who have paid taxes receive their benefits, which are determined by a complex formula that considers their lifetime earnings.\nAlthough Social Security is an important element of retirement income for most Americans, it's never served as a major source of money for the elderly. The Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, estimates that Social Security benefits only replace about 39% of previous earnings for retired people.\nWhat is the test?\nWhat is the Social Security earnings test?\nAlmost one in every three Americans collecting Social Security has retired early. For many, it's a financial necessity. Either a layoff or medical condition has made it necessary to use the benefits to stay afloat.\nHowever, not all Americans who retire early and collect Social Security have stopped working. As a result, many are subject to a Social Security earnings test that determines the amount of their monthly benefit. The Social Security earnings test is the amount you're allowed to earn from working when you claim early before part of your benefit will be withheld.\nAmericans can begin collecting Social Security when they turn 62. Benefits, however, are reduced until recipients reach full retirement age (FRA), currently set at 67 for people who were born in 1960 or later. Those benefits can be reduced even more if a recipient continues to work and earns enough to exceed a threshold set by the Social Security Administration.\nTaxable Income\nHow the test works\nHow does the Social Security earnings test work?\nIf you're under the FRA for an entire year, Social Security deducts $1 from benefits for every $2 earned above the annual limit, which was set at $23,400 in 2025. The limit increases in the year you reach full retirement age, but Social Security will still deduct $1 for every $3 you earn above $62,160 in 2025.\nThat's the bad news. Here's some good news:\nWhen you reach full retirement age, you can earn any amount of money, and your benefits won't be reduced. In addition, Social Security will recalculate your benefits to give you credit for the months that your excess earnings caused benefits to be reduced or withheld.\nAlso, while Social Security includes bonuses, commissions, and vacation pay as part of your earnings, it doesn't count pensions, annuities, investment income, interest, veteran's benefits, or other government retirement benefits.\nHere's an example: You decided to file for benefits when you turned 62 in January 2025 and have earned a monthly benefit of $600. But you're still going to be working a bit, and you think your earnings will come to $25,000. That's $1,600 above the current limit, so Social Security would withhold $1 of every $2 over that amount, or $800.\nSocial Security would withhold all benefit payments in January and February to account for the difference. Your $600 monthly benefit would begin in March, and you'd receive $400 (because Social Security withheld $1,200 worth of benefits, rather than $800) the next year.\nThe retirement earnings test works slightly differently in the year that you reach full retirement age. Let's say you wouldn't turn 67 until Nov. 23, 2025, but you've earned $62,640 between January and October. You're still expecting $600 in monthly benefits.\nThe year you hit full retirement age, you're subject to the higher threshold of $62,160. Since the difference is $480 and Social Security withholds $1 of every $3 earned above the threshold, you'd be short $160. Social Security would hang onto the full amount of your January 2026 benefit check; your money wouldn't start arriving until February. The next year, you'd receive the remaining $440 that was withheld in January.\nOne more small hitch: If you retire -- and we mean, seriously retire -- late in the year, you may be able to avoid the retirement earnings test with a monthly income that doesn't exceed $1,950. For example, let's say you've made $200,000 between January and October, but you're retiring in November and will take a part-time job that pays $500 per month. Since your earnings are less than $1,950, you'll receive your full benefit amount (although it won't be as much as it would be if you'd waited until you turned 67 or even 70, the age at which the size of your benefits stops rising).\nSupplementing Social Security\nHow to supplement Social Security\nHopefully, you won't have to rely totally on Social Security if and when you retire. As mentioned above, Social Security benefits account for roughly 37% of pre-retirement income. But as we also mentioned above, the government doesn't count quite a few sources of income in its calculations, including:\n- Investment income: About 61% of U.S. adults hold stocks. Most of the money is held in mutual funds, index funds, or 401(k)s. Investment income is key to a successful and healthy retirement. The best time to start investing was yesterday; the next best time is today. Use our list of top-rated brokerages and consider adding a little to your account using a dollar-cost averaging approach. Historically, the S&P 500 has grown about 10% annually, making a buy-and-hold strategy worth your time (and money).\nThe Motley Fool's investing philosophy recommends building a diversified portfolio of 25 or more stocks you plan to hold for at least five years. - Interest: Few Americans are happy about high inflation. Still, there's a silver lining when interest rates rise. True, a mortgage may cost more, but a high-yielding certificate of deposit (CD) or U.S. government-issued I Bond may suddenly become very attractive to people who have stopped collecting a paycheck.\n- Retirement benefits: The days of a full, company-sponsored pension may be over, but that doesn't mean your employer can't help you with a bit of financial security after you retire. Many employers offer 401(k) matching amounts; a fairly common match is a 1-to-1 match for every dollar you put into a 401(k), with a limit of 3%. It may not sound like much, but it builds up over time, and one of our Foolish rules is this: Never turn down free money.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line on the Social Security earnings test\nIt's well known that waiting as long as possible (at least to the age of 70) to begin collecting Social Security benefits will result in a larger monthly check. However, not all people nearing retirement are aware that continuing to work before reaching their full retirement age can cut into their benefits.\nThe bottom line? If you're thinking about starting to collect Social Security before your full retirement age, don't count on getting the full amount right away and plan your budget accordingly.\nFAQ\nSocial Security earnings test FAQ\nWhat is the Social Security earnings test for 2025?\nSocial Security deducts $1 for every $2 earned above $23,400 until the year in which you reach full retirement age.\nHow much income can I make and still collect Social Security?\nIf you wait to collect Social Security until reaching full retirement age (67 for most Americans), there's no limit on earnings.\nHow can you determine what your Social Security earnings will be?\nThe quickest estimate comes from a Social Security calculator.

      "text": "Full retirement age (FRA) is the age when you can claim your standard Social Security retirement benefit. Your standard benefit is called your primary insurance amount (PIA), and it's based on your inflation-adjusted average wages earned throughout your career.\nFull retirement age varies by birth year. For those born in 1960 or later, FRA is 67. If you were born between 1943 and 1959, FRA is 66 and a number of months (dependent on your year of birth). For instance, if you were born in 1959, it is 66 and 10 months.\nIt is important to know your full retirement age, as it affects when you can claim Social Security without reducing your benefits. It also impacts the amount of delayed retirement credits you can earn to raise your benefits and how much you can earn from working while receiving Social Security without forfeiting any of your benefits.\nFRA chart\nSocial Security full retirement age chart\nThe chart below shows the full retirement age for people born at different times.\n| Birth Year | Full Retirement Age |\n|---|---|\n| 1943 to 1954 | 66 |\n| 1955 | 66 and 2 months |\n| 1956 | 66 and 4 months |\n| 1957 | 66 and 6 months |\n| 1958 | 66 and 8 months |\n| 1959 | 66 and 10 months |\n| 1960 and later | 67 |\nThe effect of age\nHow does full retirement age affect your Social Security benefits?\nIf you claim your benefits at full retirement age, you will receive your standard Social Security benefit amount. If you claim prior to FRA, you will be subject to early filing penalties that reduce your benefit by the following amounts:\n- Five-ninths of 1% for each of the first 36 months before FRA\n- Five-twelfths of 1% for each subsequent month before FRA\nThis amounts to a 6.66% annual reduction for each of the first three years and an additional 5% reduction for each following year before FRA. For example, if you claim benefits at 62 with an FRA of 67, you will face a full 30% reduction in benefits.\nBy contrast, if you claim benefits after FRA, you receive delayed retirement credits valued at two-thirds of 1% per month. This results in an 8% annual increase to your monthly benefit. You can earn delayed retirement credits until age 70. After that, there's no financial benefit in delaying your claim. Delayed retirement credits cannot be earned if you are claiming either spousal benefits or survivor benefits.\nWorking past FRA\nWorking after full retirement age\nRetirees may work while collecting Social Security benefits, but those younger than their FRA will be subject to the retirement earnings test (RET). Under this test, if your earnings exceed a certain limit (which changes annually), you will temporarily forfeit some or all of your benefits. Once you reach full retirement age, your benefit is recalculated, and you may receive most of that money back.\nOther questions\nOther key questions about full retirement age\nThere are a few additional key points to consider regarding full retirement age.\n1. Do survivor benefits increase after full retirement age?\nIf you are the surviving spouse who is claiming benefits based on your deceased partner's work record, there is no benefit to waiting until after full retirement age to claim your benefits. You do not earn delayed retirement credits in this case, so your benefit will not increase.\nHowever, if you are the higher-earning spouse, delaying your claim for benefits until after FRA can result in your widow(er) receiving more monthly income, as your widowed partner will receive the higher of the two monthly benefits you were each receiving.\n2. Are Social Security benefits taxable at full retirement age?\nYour age does not have an impact on whether you will owe federal tax on Social Security benefits. Depending on your earnings, you may pay federal taxes on Social Security benefits regardless of the age at which you claim.\nSocial Security benefits are taxed on amounts exceeding the \"provisional income\" limit set by the IRS. To calculate your provisional income, add up all non-Social Security sources of income, including nontaxable income such as municipal bond interest, and include half of your annual Social Security income.\nSingle filers earning provisional income between $25,000 and $34,000 and married joint filers earning between $32,000 and $44,000 will owe income taxes on 50% of their Social Security benefits. For single filers with provisional income above $34,000 and married filers above $44,000, up to 85% of Social Security benefits will be taxable.\nTaxes on Social Security remain in effect following the passage of the \"big, beautiful bill\" (now law) on July 4, 2025. However, a new temporary tax deduction has reduced the number of retirees taxed on benefits because the deductions for more retired people now exceed their taxable benefits.\nThe White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimated that 88% of retirees will not pay tax on their payments as long as the deduction remains in effect.\nRelated retirement topics\n3. Is your full retirement age affected by where you live?\nYour full retirement age is not affected by where you live. Most Social Security rules, including those that determine benefit amount and claiming age, are set by federal law. However, some states do tax Social Security benefits, so where you live can affect tax levels on your retirement income. But again, the age at which you claim benefits won't affect your tax rate -- your income is the key factor.\nFAQ\nFull retirement age FAQ\nWhat is the full retirement age?\nFull retirement age (FRA) is based on when you were born. If you were born in 1960 or later, FRA is 67. If you were born between 1943 and 1959, FRA is 66 and a number of months (dependent on your year of birth). For instance, if you were born in 1959, it is 66 and 10 months.\nIs the full retirement age changing in 2025?\nFull retirement age changed in 2025. If you turn 66 in 2025, your FRA is 66 and 10 months. If you turned 66 in 2024, FRA was 66 and 8 months. Retirees turning 66 this year must claim benefits two months later than last year to avoid early filing penalties.\nIs it better to claim Social Security at 62 or 67?\nFor anyone born in 1960 or later, the full retirement age for Social Security is 67. That means you will receive your standard unreduced benefit if you wait to claim, and monthly checks will be larger.\nHowever, some people prefer to claim at a younger age to enable early retirement or for other reasons, such as poor health. Both options can make sense, as it depends on your circumstances and goals.\nCan I work after full retirement age?\nYou can work after full retirement age and earn as much as you'd like without affecting your Social Security benefits.\nHow much can I earn if I work after my full retirement age?\nIf you continue to work after reaching full retirement age, you may work and earn as much as you'd like. You will not be subject to the retirement earnings test, and your Social Security benefits will not be affected.\nIf you claim benefits and continue working prior to FRA, you may forfeit part of your benefits if you earn above annual thresholds. However, your benefit amount will be recalculated at full retirement age to account for most of those forfeited funds.\nDoes working after full retirement age increase Social Security benefits?\nWorking after full retirement age could increase your Social Security benefits. Your benefits are based on average wages over your 35 highest-earning years (adjusted for inflation).\nEven after you've reached full retirement age, and even if you've already claimed benefits, the Social Security Administration continues to recalculate your average annual wage to account for new income. If your earnings after FRA are higher than previous years and raise your average wage for your 35 top-earning years, your benefits could rise accordingly."

Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "Social Security forms an important part of most people's retirement plans, but the program itself does much more than just that. In a nutshell, Social Security is designed to support disabled and retired workers and their families by providing a guaranteed source of lifetime income for those who meet certain criteria.\nHere's a closer look at how the program works, the different types of Social Security benefits available, and what you can expect when you're ready to claim benefits.\nHow Social Security works\nHow Social Security works\nSocial Security is a government program that collects taxes from working Americans and distributes these funds to qualifying disabled workers, retirees, and their families to help them remain financially secure.\nA worker typically must earn 40 credits to qualify for Social Security, though if they die or are disabled young, they may qualify with fewer credits. A credit is defined as $1,730 of earned income in 2024 and $1,810 of earned income in 2025. You can earn up to four credits per year.\nYou may claim Social Security based on your own work record, if you've earned enough credits, or you may be eligible to claim spousal benefits based on your current or ex-spouse's work record if this amount is larger than what you're entitled to on your own. Dependent children and other family members may also qualify for family benefits in certain circumstances.\nWhen you're ready to apply for Social Security, you must fill out an application online or at your local Social Security Administration office. A government representative will verify the information in your application to determine if you qualify and then you'll begin receiving monthly checks.\nTypes of Social Security benefits\nTypes of Social Security benefits\nThere are three main types of Social Security benefits:\n- Retirement benefits\n- Disability benefits\n- Survivors benefits\nRetirement benefits\nRetirement benefits\nSocial Security retirement benefits are for workers 62 and older who have earned at least 40 credits. The size of your benefit checks depends on your average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) over your 35 highest-earning years, and the age at which you begin benefits.\nYou must wait until your full retirement age (FRA) to claim your standard benefit based on your AIME. Your FRA is 66 if you were born between 1943 and 1954. For those born between 1955 and 1959, FRA rose by two months every year thereafter. For anyone born in 1960 or later, full retirement age is 67.\nClaiming benefits before your full retirement age (FRA) reduces your checks.\nIf you begin claiming at 62, you'll get only 70% of your standard benefit if your FRA is 67 or 75% if your FRA is 66. Every month you delay benefits increases your checks slightly until you reach the maximum benefit at 70. This is 124% of your standard benefit if your FRA is 67 or 132% if your FRA is 66.\nReceiving Social Security benefits under your FRA could cause you to lose some of that money back to the government if your income is high enough. The Social Security Earnings Test withholds:\n- $1 from your checks for every $2 you earn above $22,320 per year if you will be under your full retirement age all year in 2024.\n- $1 from your checks for every $2 you earn above $23,400 per year if you will be under your full retirement age all year in 2025.\n- $1 for every $3 you earn over $59,520 if you will reach full retirement age in 2024.\n- $1 for every $3 you earn over $62,160 if you will reach your full retirement age in 2025.\nOnce you're past your FRA, the government recalculates your benefit to include the amount it withheld.\nCertain family members can claim benefits on your work record if doing so would give them more money than they're eligible for on their own work record.\nEligible family members include:\nEligible family members include:\n- Spouses\n- Ex-spouses, if the marriage lasted for at least 10 years and they have not remarried\n- Children under 18, or up to 19 if still enrolled in high school\n- Children of any age who were disabled before 22 and are not earning more than $1,550 per month in 2024 or $1,620 per month in 2025. Social Security defines disability as a medical condition that results in severe functional limitations and that is expected to last 12 months or longer or result in death\nSpouses and ex-spouses must be at least 62 in order to claim benefits, and spouses and children must wait for the worker to begin claiming benefits themselves before they can claim family benefits on their record.\nDisability benefits\nDisability benefits\nSocial Security disability benefits are available to adults 18 or older who are unable to work due to a physical or mental disability that is expected to last at least 12 months or result in death. You may still be eligible even if you haven't earned 40 credits, depending upon your age at the time of your disability. Your benefit is determined by your average lifetime earnings, so individuals who earned more while they were working will receive larger disability checks.\nYou must provide the government with information about your work history and your medical condition, including relevant supporting documents, when you apply. The Social Security Administration will review your case to decide if you are eligible. If it rules in your favor, you'll receive disability checks for as long as your disability lasts or the rest of your life, depending on the condition. If it rules against you, you may request a reconsideration or appeal to an administrative law judge.\nFamily members may be able to claim benefits on a disabled worker\u2019s work record if they are:\n- A spouse 62 or older or of any age if caring for a disabled worker\u2019s disabled child or child 16 or younger\n- Ex-spouses who were married to the disabled worker for at least 10 years and have not remarried if they meet the same criteria as spouses\n- Unmarried children up to 18, or 19 if still attending high school\n- Children of any age who were disabled before 22\nSurvivors benefits\nSurvivors benefits\nSurvivors benefits are benefits for the family members of deceased workers who qualified for Social Security.\nThe amount of the survivors benefit depends on the deceased worker's average income, adjusted for inflation, and their relationship to the deceased.\nSurviving spouses who are 60 or older (50 or older if disabled) may claim survivors benefits, as can surviving spouses of any age if they are caring for the deceased worker's child who is under 16 or disabled. The same rules apply for ex-spouses as long as they were married to the deceased worker for at least 10 years and have not remarried.\nThe deceased worker's children under 18, or up to 19 if still enrolled in high school, are eligible for benefits, as are disabled children of any age if they were disabled before 22. Parents of the deceased worker may also qualify for benefits if the deceased was providing 50% or more of their financial support before they died.\nIn addition to these benefits, the surviving spouse or children may be eligible for a one-time death benefit of $255.\nRelated Retirement Topics\nBrief history of Social Security\nBrief history of Social Security\nThe Social Security program was created by the Social Security Act that President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law in 1935. The first checks went out in 1940. Originally it paid benefits only to workers 65 and older, but in the 1970s the government altered it to allow workers to claim benefits as early as 62. It also instituted annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) to help Social Security keep pace with inflation.\nThe program has worked fairly well so far, but many people fear for the future, when there will be fewer workers to support a greater number of Social Security recipients.\nThe latest Social Security Trustees' Report indicates that the program's retirement trust fund could be depleted by 2033, after which it would be able to pay out only about 79% of benefits to retirees. Though previous reports estimated that Social Security's disability trust fund would run dry by 2057, the latest trustee's report projects that the disability trust fund will not be depleted in the next 75 years.\nThe government has proposed several possible solutions for ensuring the long-term sustainability of the program, but at present no plans have been set. There's no risk of the program disappearing in the next decade or two, but it's possible future benefits may not go as far as they do today. That's why today's workers need to prioritize their personal retirement savings, so they can cover most of their expenses on their own."

      "text": "Learning how to maximize your Social Security can make a big difference in your retirement planning. Social Security makes up about 30% of income for people 65 and older. But increasing your Social Security requires careful planning.\nSeven tips for raising your Social Security\nSeven tips to increasing your Social Security check\nIn this article, we'll cover seven strategies for maximizing your Social Security checks and explain how much you'll get after accounting for Medicare and taxes.\n1. Earn a bigger paycheck\n1. Earn a bigger paycheck\nOf course, you can't just snap your fingers and make your boss give you a raise. But your benefit is based on how much you've paid into Social Security, so earning more will help you score fatter checks. If negotiating a higher salary at your current job isn't an option, you could apply for better-paying jobs or take on a side gig.\nKeep in mind, though, that Social Security will only consider your earnings up to the maximum taxable income in any given year. The taxable maximum is $160,200 in 2023; it increases to $168,000 in 2024. So, even if you earn $1 million in 2024, Social Security would record your yearly income as $168,600.\nTaxable Income\n2. Work 35+ years\n2. Work at least 35 years\nThe Social Security benefits formula uses an inflation-adjusted average of your 35 highest years of earnings. If you only work 32 years, you'll have three years with $0 in earnings, which would drag down your benefit. Working at least 35 years will help you maximize your benefit -- and working additional years could increase your benefit if you're replacing lower-earning years with higher-earning ones.\n3. Delay as long as possible\n3. Delay as long as possible\nYou won't be eligible for your primary insurance amount until you reach full retirement age (FRA), which is 67 if you were born in 1960 or later. It's possible to start Social Security at age 62, but your benefit will be about 30% lower.\nIf you truly want to score the maximum Social Security benefit, though, you'll want to delay past FRA. You'll earn an extra 8% in delayed retirement credits for every year you wait, up to age 70, which is when your benefit maxes out.\n4. If working, avoid claiming until FRA\n4. If you're working, avoid collecting a check until FRA\nIn 2023. if you claim Social Security while working and haven't reached FRA, Social Security imposes limits on how much you can earn before it withholds part of your benefit:\n- Until the year you reach FRA, Social Security withholds $1 for every $2 you earn above $21,240. That threshold will increase to $22,320 in 2024.\n- From the year you reach FRA to the month you're eligible for your full benefit, Social Security withholds $1 for every $3 you earn above $56,520. That threshold will increase to $59,520 in 2024.\nOnce you reach FRA, Social Security won't withhold part of your benefit, no matter how much you earn. Note that even if you collect benefits early and continue working, Social Security will recalculate your benefit when you reach FRA to give you credit for the amount it withheld. Your benefit will increase as a result.\n5. Collect spousal or survivor benefits\n5. Collect spousal or survivor benefits\nIf your current or former spouse earned significantly more than you, you may get a bigger benefit by collecting based on their work record. Spousal benefits are paid to current spouses, as well as ex-spouses (if the marriage lasted at 10 least years).\nThe maximum benefit is 50% of their primary benefit. Collecting early will reduce your benefit more, but you can't earn delayed retirement credits for waiting past FRA. Your benefit will max out at age 67, not 70.\nIf you're a widowed spouse (or if your ex-spouse of at least 10 years has died), you could be eligible for survivor benefits. Survivor benefits are up to 100% of the late spouse's benefit (if they were already claiming) or up to 100% of their primary insurance amount (if they weren't taking benefits yet).\nYou can claim as early as age 60, rather than 62, for a reduced amount. As with spousal benefits, survivor benefits max out at age 67. Note that Social Security doesn't let you claim multiple benefits. You can collect your own retirement benefit or a spousal or survivor benefit, but not both.\n6. Get a one-time do-over\n6. Get a one-time do-over\nIf you've already started receiving Social Security but now wish you'd held out for a larger benefit, you may have two options for increasing your checks:\n- If it's been fewer than 12 months since you were approved for benefits: You can withdraw your application for benefits and reapply later, but you'll need to repay all benefits you received, as well as any money withheld for taxes and Medicare premiums.\nMedicare\n- If you're already FRA but haven't turned 70 yet: You can request that Social Security suspend your benefits to earn delayed retirement credits, and then reinstate them later. Once you're 70, Social Security will automatically restart your payments if you haven't already had them reinstated.\n7. Open a Roth account\n7. Save for retirement in a Roth account\nYou technically won't get bigger Social Security payments if you opt for a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k) over traditional accounts, but you will get to keep more of your benefit. Withdrawals from Roth accounts are generally tax-free in retirement because you've already paid taxes on that money. However, with traditional retirement accounts, you get a tax break on your contributions but have to pay taxes on withdrawals.\nRoth withdrawals aren't counted as income for Social Security purposes, so saving in a Roth IRA account maximizes the amount of your Social Security check you actually get to keep.\nAverage Social Security payment\nThe average Social Security payment\nIn 2023, the average Social Security payment for retired workers was $1,848 per month. The average monthly benefit is expected to rise to $1,907 in January 2024 once the 3.2% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2024 is applied.\nThe maximum monthly benefit for someone retiring at FRA in 2023 is $3,627. With the 2024 COLA, that amount will jump to $3,822.\nHow much will Medicare deduct from my check?\nHow much will Medicare deduct from my Social Security check?\nMost people don't pay a Medicare Part A premium; however, Part B premiums are typically deducted from Social Security checks. In 2023, most seniors pay $164.90 a month for Part B premiums, but those with incomes above $97,000 (individuals) or $194,000 (married couples) pay higher amounts.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line\nOne of the biggest myths about Social Security is that increasing your payments is easy. But as you can see, maximizing your Social Security benefit requires you to work more, earn more, or delay benefits you may need well before age 70.\nWhile Social Security is a lifeline for seniors in the U.S., retirement is difficult when your benefit is your only source of income. That's why it's essential to invest for retirement as early as possible. But if you're behind on saving, then working longer and delaying benefits are two good strategies for maximizing your Social Security.\nFAQs\nMaximizing Social Security: FAQs\nAt what point do you max out Social Security?\nYou'll max out Social Security retirement benefits at age 70, at which point you can no longer earn delayed retirement credits. You also can't earn delayed retirement credits for spousal and survivor benefits. Your benefit will max out at full retirement age, which is 67 for anyone born after 1959.\nWhat is the 35-year rule for Social Security?\nThe 35-year rule refers to the benefit formula Social Security uses. Your benefits are based on your highest 35 years of earnings. If you worked fewer than 35 years, the years you didn't work are calculated as $0.\nAt what age is Social Security no longer taxed?\nFederal taxes on Social Security are based on your income, not your age. Up to 50% of your benefit is taxable if your income is between $25,000 and $34,000 (singles) or $32,000 and $44,000 (married couples). Above these thresholds, up to 85% of your benefit is taxable."

  "argos_summary": "A recent AARP survey highlights significant misconceptions about Social Security among retirees and those nearing retirement, which could lead to poor decisions regarding benefit claims. Key misunderstandings include the earliest age to claim benefits (62), the age for maximizing benefits (70), and the full retirement age (67 for those born in 1960 or later). Additionally, many are unaware of eligibility for spousal benefits based on an ex-partner's work record and the implications of the Social Security earnings test on benefits for those still working. Understanding these aspects is crucial for optimizing Social Security benefits.",
