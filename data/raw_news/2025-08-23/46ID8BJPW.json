  "content": "All 2025 pre-filled syringe doses to be made in Canada, marking a domestic production milestone\n\nCAMBRIDGE, MA / ACCESS Newswire / August 22, 2025 / Moderna announced today that Health Canada has authorized its updated COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Spikevax\u00ae, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 LP.8.1 variant, for individuals aged six months and older. Moderna is on track to deliver the updated vaccine in time for the 2025-2026 vaccination season.\n\nAll Spikevax pre-filled syringe (PFS) doses for the Canadian market will now be manufactured domestically, marking the first time Canada\u2019s entire PFS format is produced at home. The drug substance will be produced at Moderna\u2019s new facility in Laval, Quebec, with fill-finish operations completed by Novocol Pharma in Cambridge, Ontario. These Canadian-made doses are expected to be available for this fall.\n\n\u201cThis approval is a regulatory milestone and a testament to Canada\u2019s growing leadership in biomanufacturing and public health resilience,\u201d said St\u00e9phane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. \u201cThanks to Health Canada\u2019s timely and thorough review, we are proud to supply Spikevax doses to communities across the country, including, for the first time this year, doses produced in Canada.\u201d\n\nModerna\u2019s updated COVID-19 vaccine targeting LP.8.1 has already been granted approval by regulators in Europe, Japan, Switzerland and other countries. Additional regulatory applications are under review around the world in preparation for the coming season.\n\nEligibility for the public vaccination program is set by each province and territory. Those who meet provincial criteria will receive the vaccine free of charge. For individuals not covered under the public programs, efforts are ongoing with private insurers and payers to streamline access and reimbursement within the private sector.\n\nCanadians are encouraged to consult their provincial or territorial health authorities for the latest information on eligibility and availability.\n\nHealth Canada\u2019s authorization is based on a comprehensive body of evidence submitted by Moderna, including clinical, non-clinical, and real-world data supporting the vaccine\u2019s safety and efficacy.[1]\n\nModerna is a leader in the creation of the field of mRNA medicine. Through the advancement of mRNA technology, Moderna is reimagining how medicines are made and transforming how we treat and prevent disease for everyone. By working at the intersection of science, technology and health for more than a decade, the company has developed medicines at unprecedented speed and efficiency, including one of the earliest and most effective COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nModerna\u2019s mRNA platform has enabled the development of therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases and autoimmune diseases.

It carries a \u201cmessage\u201d\u2013instructions that direct your cells what to do.\nFighting disease differently\nmRNA medicines fight diseases in a different way than traditional medicine by prompting your immune system to create the tools to treat or prevent disease.\nLimitless treatments\nWe believe that if mRNA can treat one disease, it can treat many diseases. We will use mRNA to treat diseases for which there are currently no treatments.\nHelping more people\nmRNA medicine contains no animal products or preservatives, making medicine accessible for as many people as possible.\nMore medicines, faster\nOur platform enables rapid design, research and testing of multiple mRNAs, within days. Our novel production methods allow us to get medicines to more people, faster.\nMeet Keke\nSenior Director of People Analytics\n\"Here, we emphasize nurturing each individual to thrive and perform at their peak.
