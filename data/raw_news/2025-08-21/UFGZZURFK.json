  "description": "Tucker is back in the starting lineup for Thursday's game after sitting out the first three games of a series against the Brewers.",
  "content": "CHICAGO \u2013 Kyle Tucker addressed the hairline fracture in his right hand on Thursday, an injury he suffered after a headfirst slide into second base in the first inning of a game against the Cincinnati Reds on June 1.\n\n\u201cAfter the injury or whatever, it just kind of started hurting and I came out,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cI thought I just jammed it, it was kind of swollen. We did some X-rays and at the time it was still kind of bothering me \u2014 I don\u2019t know the timeframe after that. We did some more (X-rays) and saw a little small fracture in there. It was already a week or two after that and it was already healing. I just kept playing through it and thought at some point it would go away. It kind of stuck around for a little bit. But I was playing well, hitting the ball and everything.\u201d\n\nTucker initially stayed in that game against the Reds, but was replaced by Vidal Bruj\u00e1n in the fifth inning. The Cubs had a day off the following day and Tucker wasn\u2019t in the starting lineup for the next two games, but pinch hit in the ninth inning of the second of those two games. June was one of his most productive months offensively as he delivered a 173 wRC+ with 14 extra-base hits.\n\nBut in July, Tucker managed just four extra-base hits (just one home run) and hit .218. His 20.6 percent walk rate kept him productive and helped him earn a .380 on-base percentage, but it was clear he wasn\u2019t right. By August, he was clearly ineffective, posting a 16 wRC+ in 15 games entering play on Thursday.\n\nIt all culminated in an 0-for-4 showing on Monday with three weak groundouts during which Tucker was booed by his home fans multiple times. Manager Craig Counsell decided to sit Tucker over the next three games before inserting him back in the starting lineup on Thursday against the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nIs the hand injury something he\u2019s still dealing with?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty much past it,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve been playing the whole time anyways and I\u2019m feeling good. I\u2019m all right.\u201d\n\nUntil a report by ESPN that came out late Wednesday night, neither Tucker nor the team acknowledged there was a fracture in Tucker\u2019s hand. Would it have been easier if Tucker had just said he was playing through this once he learned of the issue?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we could have gone a couple different ways,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cI felt good enough to go out there and play and confident that I could go out there and do it well.\u201d\n\nMaybe a stint on the injured list would have allowed him to avoid these deep struggles?\n\n\u201cI was already playing through it for however long and playing fine,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cSo I was just like, \u2018I\u2019m going to keep playing.\u2019 There wasn\u2019t a need to go on the IL because I could still do everything. It was just a pain tolerance at that point rather than I couldn\u2019t physically do it.\u201d\n\nOne theory that has been floated is that Tucker altered his mechanics to play through the pain. While he was able to thrive early, eventually the changes led to these struggles. For Tucker, there\u2019s no way of really knowing if that\u2019s the case.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t try and change my mechanics or anything,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cBut it could have gradually happened over time, I don\u2019t know. I was just playing with it and I was doing fine for a while. After a while it kind of turned. I don\u2019t know if that was the reason why, but it\u2019s how things played out.\u201d\n\nDespite a rough stretch of play, Tucker still has a strong 131 wRC+ and, according to FanGraphs, has reached 4 WAR for the fifth straight season. Tucker is expected to be the most sought-after position player on the market when he hits free agency this winter.",
