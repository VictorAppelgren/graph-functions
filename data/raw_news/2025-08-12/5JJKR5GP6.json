  "content": "SOON after losing 4st with skinny jabs, Jane Fennah\u2019s eyes turned yellow - and she needed an organ removed.\n\n\"I thought I was going to die because I wanted to lose weight,\" the 39-year-old from Lancashire said. \"It was horrific.\"\n\nThe mum-of-two who weighed 21st (133kg), began using the \u00a3170-a-month Mounjaro jab she'd bought from an online pharmacy in February 2025 after splitting from her partner.\n\nShe\u2019d seen the dramatic transformation posts online and wanted her own post-break-up glow-up.\n\n\"Everybody is on the jabs and I've struggled with my weight,\" she said.\n\n\"So when I split up with my partner last year I thought I need to sort myself out and it will help me because everyone is on it and I've seen so many success stories.\"\n\nThe family of drugs known as GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s), originally developed to treat diabetes.\n\nThey are now often being used for weight loss after they were found to suppress appetite and slow down digestion.\n\nWithin five months of being on the jabs, Jane has lost four stone - dropping from 21 stone down to 17 stone.\n\n\"I had no side effects other than the normal ones of the jab like feeling sick,\" she said.\n\n\"I did what people said, drank plenty of water, and took my vitamins.\"\n\nSix weeks in, Jane felt hungry again and upped her dose to 5mg, later increasing to 7.5mg.\n\n\"I started getting really bad diarrhoea. I looked into forums and people said that can happen so I carried on.\"\n\n\"My urine was brown, the tissue was brown. I thought I had to drink water and that I was dehydrated. I thought I might have a bug because I have kids in school.\"\n\nThen came agony in her chest and back.\n\n\"It started hurting my back and I had to walk bent over, I couldn't stand straight, I couldn't sit down,\" she said.\n\n\"Three weeks ago, I woke up and I thought something is not right, this is too bad. I thought I was having a heart attack.\n\n\"I called 111 and they sent me a taxi to the hospital.\n\n\"Even halfway through the breath the pain was horrendous and like stabbing. The pain was stopping me from breathing.\"\n\n\"They put me straight in blood thinners, they said I had blood clots but my gallbladder was so inflamed they couldn't see it.\n\n\"I have lots of gallstones and blockage to the liver.\n\n\"My eyes started to turn yellow. You could see my face was turning yellow.\"\n\nShe later learned her extreme tiredness and hair loss were also linked.\n\n\" I found out [they were both] was a sign of the infection, but I just put it down to being a mum,\" Jane said.\n\nJane spent nine days in hospital and is now waiting for surgery to have her gallbladder removed.\n\n\"The doctor said to stop taking the jab because it's not worth it,\" she added.\n\nJane has since sworn never to touch the medicines again.\n\nInstead she plans to start going to start the gym and \"eating healthy\", which she says includes drinking protein shakes and eating more veg and greens.\n\n'It's not worth it'\n\nShe now thinks the jabs should be harder to get hold of.\n\n\"There needs to be more tests before people get them, it shouldn't be so easily accessible,\" she explained.\n\n\"People don't understand that not everyone is going to suffer these complications but there's a lot of people who are. It's scary, it's not worth it.\"\n\nMounjaro\u2019s leaflet warns gallstones are a common side effect, affecting up to one in ten people.\n\n\"We take reports about patient safety seriously and investigate and report safety events in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\n\"We encourage patients to consult their doctor or other healthcare professional about any possible side effects they may be experiencing.\n\n\"Mounjaro (tirzepatide) must be prescribed by a licensed healthcare professional and prescriptions should be fulfilled and supplied only by registered pharmacies and providers.\"\n\nAre you eligible for weight loss jabs on the NHS? THEY are arguably the biggest medical breakthrough of recent times. And now, so-called \u2018fat jabs\u2019 are available to many more Brits on the NHS. In what marks the dawn of a new era, GPs have begun prescribing the weight loss jab Mounjaro in the first anti-obesity rollout of its kind. More than three million people are thought to be eligible for tirzepatide - the active drug in Mounjaro - the strongest jab on the market. Health chiefs hope it will turn the tide on England\u2019s obesity crisis which has seen rates double since the 1990s. Injections including Ozempic and Wegovy have previously only been available for type 2 diabetes or through specialist slimming clinics. Family doctors will now be encouraged to prescribe them in a bid to get more people on the meds. Experts hope widespread use will slash work sick days and boost the economy, while reducing rates of cancer, heart disease and dementia. But demand for the drugs is already huge and NHS clinics cannot dish them out fast enough. Who is eligible in the new rollout? The new rollout allows GPs to prescribe tirzepatide for weight loss, starting with those patients whose weight places them at greatest health risk. Top of the list will be those with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher (or 37.5 if from a minority ethnic background) and four weight-related health conditions. A BMI of 40 is roughly equal to weighing 16st (102kg) for an average height 5\u20193\u201d woman, or 19st 6lbs (123kg) for an average 5\u20199\u201d man. Patients will likely be expected to have tried diet and exercise first before being offered a jab. Many are likely to miss out, as some 13.5million adults in England are obese but only 3.4million are estimated to be eligible in the rollout. Professor Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cCurrently only patients who meet certain criteria - those who could benefit most - are eligible to be prescribed weight loss drugs on the NHS, and GPs will also need to follow local guidelines when prescribing. \u201cIf your practice advises you that they won\u2019t be able to provide weight loss medication, these will likely be the reasons why. \u201cWe appreciate the idea of weight loss medication is an attractive prospect to many patients - and they do have a lot of potential benefits for patients and may be a valuable tool as we try to tackle obesity at a national level \u2013 but it\u2019s important these medications aren\u2019t seen as a silver bullet. \u201cWeight loss drugs do not come without risk, they can cause side effects which range in seriousness, and they won\u2019t be suitable for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s important we don\u2019t lose sight of the role lifestyle factors play in achieving a healthy weight. \u201cThe roll out of weight loss medications as a treatment for obesity must not come at the expense of other weight loss services.\u201d If you are eligible but your GP denies you a prescription, you may be able to ask for a referral to specialist weight management services. Known as tier 2 and tier 3 weight management services, they may prescribe the jabs after other weight loss attempts. Many people are expected to find it easier to go private, with the injections widely available from high street pharmacies like Boots, Superdrug, and even Asda. There are also numerous online pharmacies offering the drugs. Buying the drugs online might seem like the faster fix \u2013 but buyer beware. Slimming success stories are everywhere but so, too, are tales of horror. Many patients have been duped by dodgy sellers, suffered severe side effects or even died after taking jabs they bought online. Bargain prices, easy tick-box applications, or prescriptions with no follow-up, should all be red flags to online shoppers.",

The drug, originally developed to treat diabetes, was often used for weight loss after it was found to suppress appetite and slow digestion. Within five months of being on the jabs, Jane lost four stone - dropping from 21st to 17 stone. However, after feeling unwell, she experienced severe diarrhoea and severe chest and back pain, leading to an operation to remove her gallbladder.

Jane has since vowed never to touch the medicines again and has suggested that the use of these jabs should be made more stringent.",
