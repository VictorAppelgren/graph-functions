  "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump, next to Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, speaks during an event to announce that the Space Force Command will move from Colorado to Alabama, in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., September 2, 2025.\n\nLabor Day in the U.S., which took place Monday, marks the unofficial end of summer \u2014 which means saying goodbye to the promise of all life could be and once again squeezing it to fit the four walls of the office.\n\nBut there was someone eager to get back to work: U.S. President Donald Trump. (Not that he appeared to take a summer vacation at all, as CNN reported.) Trump said Tuesday he will request an \"expedited ruling\" from the Supreme Court to overturn a federal appeals court decision that most of his tariffs were illegal.\n\nThe White House leader blamed that ruling for the fall in stocks Tuesday. \"The stock market's down because of that, because the stock market needs the tariffs,\" he said. \"They want the tariffs.\"\n\nIt's a debatable assertion, given that stocks sank after Trump announced his \"reciprocal\" tariffs on that fateful April day, and surged \u2014 in one of the biggest rallies in history \u2014 following a pause in the implementation of levies.\n\nHowever, Trump is potentially right in one aspect of the market benefiting from tariffs: Treasurys.

      "text": "Stocks plummeted Thursday, sending the S&P 500 back into correction territory for its biggest one-day loss since 2020, after President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs, raising the risk of a global trade war that plunges the economy into a recession.\nThe broad market index dropped 4.84% and settled at 5,396.52, posting its worst day since June 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 1,679.39 points, or 3.98%, to close at 40,545.93 and mark its worst session since June 2020. The Nasdaq Composite plummeted 5.97% and ended at 16,550.61, registering its biggest decline since March 2020. The slide across equities was broad, with more than 400 of the S&P 500's constituents posting losses.\nThursday's moves sent the S&P 500 to its lowest level since before Trump's election win in November. The benchmark now sits about 12% from its record close touched in February.\nShares of multinational companies tumbled. Nike and Apple dropped 14% and 9%, respectively. Big sellers of imported goods were among the hardest hit. Five Below lost nearly 28%, Dollar Tree tumbled 13% and Gap plunged 20%. Tech shares dropped in an overall risk-off mood, with Nvidia off almost 8% and Tesla down more than 5%.\nA baseline tariff rate of 10% on all countries goes into effect April 5. Even bigger duties against countries that levy higher rates on the U.S. will be charged in coming days, according to the administration.\nOn Thursday, the president acknowledged the market sell-off and likened the implementation of tariffs to \"an operation, like when a patient gets operated on.\"\n\"The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom. And the rest of the world wants to see is there any way they can make a deal,\" Trump said.\nTraders had hoped that Trump's tariff plan would use a 10% rate, or at worst a 20% rate as a cap, not as a minimum starting point. Rates will end up being much higher than what investors had expected for many nations. For example, the effective tariff rate for China will now be 54% when accounting for the new reciprocal rate and duties already levied against the country, the White House clarified to CNBC.\n\"This was the worst case scenario for tariffs and [they] were not priced-into the markets, which is why we are seeing such a risk-off reaction,\" said Mary Ann Bartels, chief investment strategist at Sanctuary Wealth. \"The big question is if 5,500 can hold on the S&P 500. If it cannot hold, we may see another 5-10% downside, which could likely point to a bottom of 5,200-5,400.\"\nInvestors turned to bonds in their search for safety. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell as low as 4% as bond prices increased.\nThe benchmark has been hit hard since late February with it falling into correction territory \u2014 or 10% down from its record \u2014 because of the heightened uncertainty caused by Trump's ongoing tariff announcements. This uncertainty has started to show up in some sluggish economic data, which further pressured stocks by heightening recession fears.\nJPMorgan economists said a recession was now likely if these new tariff rates are sustained and not negotiated lower."

      "text": "The stock market mounted one of its biggest rallies in history after President Donald Trump announced a pause in some of his \"reciprocal\" tariffs on the globe, causing a market that has been under extreme pressure for the past week to explode higher.\nThe S&P 500 skyrocketed 9.52% to settle at 5,456.90 for its biggest one-day gain since 2008. For the broad market index, it was the third-biggest gain in post-WWII history. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 2,962.86 points, or 7.87%, to close at 40,608.45 for its biggest percentage advance since March 2020. The Nasdaq Composite jumped 12.16% to end at 17,124.97, notching its largest one-day jump since January 2001 and second-best day ever.\nAbout 30 billion shares traded hands, making it the heaviest volume day on Wall Street in history, according to records that go back 18 years.\n\"I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social. Trump, in the same post, said he was raising the tariff on China higher again to 125%.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent later clarified that all countries except China would return to the 10% baseline tariff rate, down from the higher rates that previously shocked the markets, as negotiations take place. The pause would not apply to sector tariffs, Bessent said.\nStocks that were heavily pressured by the trade war tensions led the comeback Wednesday afternoon. Apple and Nvidia soared more than 15% and nearly 19%, respectively. Walmart shares rallied 9.6%. Tesla shares climbed more than 22% on the back of the pause announcement.\n\"Given how depressed stock prices and sentiment had become, the 90-day pause is sparking a violent rebound, and delaying implementation certainly removes a giant overhang from the market,\" said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge. \"But \u2014 tariffs are not going away. China's tariff rate is now in triple digit territory, and who knows what happens in 90 days when this pause concludes.\"\nPrior to the announcement of the 90-day pause, investors were on edge over an escalating tit-for-tat between China and Trump. The European Union had also approved its first set of tariffs on the U.S. set to start April 15.\nNonetheless, stocks were trending higher into the afternoon. Traders were encouraged after Bessent stated he would be taking a lead negotiating role in tariff talks. President Trump also urged investors that now was \"a great time to buy\" shortly after the market open in a post on Truth Social.\nTrump's pause declaration went out at 1:18 p.m. ET when the Dow was about 350 points higher for the day. Seconds later, the 30-stock index surged more than 2,000 points.\nIn a press conference later in the afternoon, Trump said investors' fears had gone overboard.\n\"I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy, you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid,\" said Trump.\nAnxiety around the rollout of the tariffs fueled a four-day rout for stocks. Over the course of the previous four trading sessions, the Dow lost more than 4,500 points, while the S&P 500 sustained a 12% fall. The Nasdaq Composite was down more than 13% during that period. These were losses not seen since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"This allows for at least a near-term rally, but I would not assume that the bottom has been put in place,\" added Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. \"Fool me once shame on you; fool me five times, shame on me.\""

      "text": "Independent analyses \u2014 by sources ranging from Yale University to the Wharton School to the Congressional Budget Office \u2013 have each said that President Donald Trump's budget plan will add trillions of dollars to the U.S. deficit over the next 10 years.\nWhat's at stake if the deficit continues on its upward trajectory? This year, the U.S. deficit is exceeding 6% of the gross domestic product, a level roughly 63% higher than the average in the past five decades. And unlike past spikes, the current one isn't driven by war or economic crisis, leading many to raise concerns about why America might be playing with fire when it comes to its fiscal health.\nCNBC's \"America's Deficit Reckoning\" explores the consequences \u2014 not how to solve the budget deficit, but what's at stake if we don't.\nWatch the video to learn more.\nThrough interviews with more than a dozen top officials, economists and investors, including former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, macro investor Ray Dalio, and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, CNBC homed in on three potential areas of fallout: the markets, the economy and international relations.\nMarkets at risk: Persistent deficits have many prominent investors on high alert. Dalio said the U.S. is showing \"classic signs\" of a late-stage debt cycle, ascribing a 50% chance of trauma in the next three years. PIMCO's Chief Investment Officer Dan Ivascyn was a bit more sanguine, saying that he thinks a crisis of investor confidence is unlikely in the U.S. but has been diversifying away from Treasuries. That mirrors some recent activity in the bond market, which hasn't been overtly reacting to the new budget plan. Still, the bond vigilantes will police the deficit when they feel it's necessary: Ed Yardeni, who coined the term in the early '80s, said they're more powerful than ever.\nEconomic strain: If Americans benefit from policies such as tax cuts and higher spending, why should they care about the longer-term implications of wider deficits? The most apparent risk to the economy is inflation, which would keep interest rates higher and \"crowd out\" private investment. Additionally, when interest payments become a higher proportion of federal outlays, they drain resources that would otherwise go to other budget line items, says Maya MacGuineas of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. And it hinders the government's ability to respond in the event of an emergency. But some of the worst economic effects will be felt by future generations, who, according to one Gen Zer interviewed by CNBC, are already concerned the deficit will impede their ability to collect social services.\nInternational implications: Admiral Michael Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, once called the national debt the \"greatest threat to national security.\" His concern was that as debt levels increase and rates remain higher, it could squeeze discretionary defense spending. As historian Niall Ferguson warns: A great power that spends more on interest payments than defense breaches a threshold that historically has preceded a decline. The U.S. crossed that red line last year. There's also a significant interdependence between the U.S. and its foreign creditors, especially China and Japan, so if global investors begin to truly question America's fiscal health, the ripple effects could extend beyond the bond markets.\nThe clock is ticking: Experts at the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimate the U.S. has less than 20 years to fix its fiscal trajectory. After that, even aggressive tax hikes or spending cuts may not be enough to stave off default \u2014 implicit or otherwise. While the U.S. can technically print its way out of debt, doing so risks runaway inflation, economic contraction, and geopolitical fallout.\nAs Rubin put it, we may be entering uncharted territory. The time to prepare is now \u2014 before markets force our hand."

      "text": "A federal appeals court ruled Friday that most of President Donald Trump's global tariffs are illegal, striking a massive blow to the core of his aggressive trade policy.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held in a 7-4 ruling that the law Trump invoked when he granted his most expansive tariffs \u2014 including his \"reciprocal\" tariffs \u2014 does not actually grant him the power to impose those levies.\n\"The core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution,\" the court said. \"Tariffs are a core Congressional power.\"\nThe appellate court paused its ruling from taking effect until Oct. 14, in order to give the Trump administration time to ask the Supreme Court to reverse the decision.\nTrump later Friday attacked the appeals court as \"Highly Partisan\" and asserted that the Supreme Court will rule in his favor.\n\"If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. \"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.\"\n\"The President's tariffs remain in effect, and we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a separate statement.\nFriday's ruling is the second straight loss for Trump in the make-or-break case, known as V.O.S. Selections v. Trump.\nThe case was consolidated from two separate lawsuits, one filed by a dozen states and the other by five small U.S. businesses.\nIt is the furthest along of more than half a dozen federal lawsuits challenging Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs.\n\"For the second time in this case, a federal court has held that the President's so-called 'Liberation Day' tariffs are unlawful,\" said attorney Jeffrey Schwab of the Liberty Justice Center, which represented the small-business plaintiffs in the case.\n\"This decision protects American businesses and consumers from the uncertainty and harm caused by these unlawful tariffs,\" Schwab said in a statement.\n\"The decision today is a powerful reaffirmation of our nation's core constitutional commitments from our nation's Founders, especially the principle that Presidents must act within the rule of law,\" said Neal Katyal, Schwab's co-counsel, in the statement.\nThe Trump administration has argued that IEEPA empowers the president to effectively impose country-specific tariffs at any level if he deems them necessary to address a national emergency.\nThe U.S. Court of International Trade in late May rejected that stance and struck down Trump's IEEPA-based tariffs, including his worldwide reciprocal tariffs. That ruling also cancelled Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, which were imposed to address the alleged trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S.\nThe Federal Circuit quickly paused that ruling while Trump's appeal played out. But multiple appellate judges appeared highly skeptical of the Trump administration's arguments when they heard oral arguments in late July.\nIn Friday's ruling, the court found that the challenged tariffs exceeded Trump's authority under IEEPA.\n\"Both the Trafficking Tariffs and the Reciprocal Tariffs are unbounded in scope, amount, and duration,\" the majority ruled.\n\"These tariffs apply to nearly all articles imported into the United States (and, in the case of the Reciprocal Tariffs, apply to almost all countries), impose high rates which are ever-changing and exceed those set out in the [U.S. tariff system], and are not limited in duration.\"\nThe four dissenters said they disagreed with the majority's conclusion on the question of the tariffs' legality.\nAnd the dissent said the plaintiffs had not justified their argument for a summary judgment in their favor.\nThe appeal was considered by 11 of the 12 judges on the Federal Circuit. The twelfth judge on the court, Pauline Newman, did not participate in the case, as she has been suspended from her duties since 2023. Newman, 98, is in a long-running dispute with the court over a request that she undergo a cognitive evaluation in order to continue hearing cases.\nThe appeals court decision came just hours after Trump's top trade negotiators urged the judges to consider what they called \"supplemental developments\" in the case, including an assessment from the Congressional Budget Office that tariffs will reduce U.S. deficits by $4 trillion over the next decade.\nStriking down the tariffs Trump imposed under IEEPA \"would cause massive and irreparable harm to the United States and its foreign policy and national security both now and in the future,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a declaration to the court.\n\"Such a ruling would threaten broader U.S. strategic interests at home and abroad, likely lead to retaliation and the unwinding of agreed-upon deals by foreign-trading partners, and derail critical ongoing negotiations with foreign-trading partners,\" he said."

The tariffs also included duties imposed on China, Canada and Mexico \u2014 who are the among the U.S.'s largest trading partners \u2014 because of those countries' purportedly not doing enough to stem the flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the United States.\nThe Federal Circuit appeals court, in ruling that those tariffs are not legal, said, \"The core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution.\"\n\"Tariffs are a core Congressional power,\" the court said.\nIf the Supreme Court upholds the decision, most imports into the United States would not be subject to tariffs.\nBefore the ruling, the Tax Foundation found that Trump's tariffs would affect nearly 70% of U.S. imports. If the ruling is upheld, just 16% of imports would be tariffed.\nThis is breaking news. Please refresh for updates."

      "text": "Treasury yields jumped on Tuesday to begin September trading as a court decision knocking down most of the Trump administration's tariffs raised the prospect of the government having to repay the money already brought in, stretching an already-stressed U.S. fiscal situation.\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose 5 basis points to 4.281%. The 30-year bond yield climbed more than 5 basis points to 4.977%. The 2-year Treasury yield moved 3 basis points higher to 3.658%. One basis point is equal to 0.01%, and yields and prices move in opposite directions.\nAt their highs of the session, the 30-year yield topped 4.97%, its highest since late July. The 10-year hit a high of 4.279%, its highest since Aug. 27. The jump in yields was hitting the stock market with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 500 points.\nRates overseas were also jumping with 30-year yields in Germany hitting their highest since 2011. French long-bond yields hit their highest since 2009.\nU.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs are in focus after a federal appeals court on Friday ruled that most of his global tariffs are illegal. The court determined in a 7-4 ruling that only Congress has the power to implement sweeping levies. Trump responded that the decision was \"highly partisan\" and that he will be appealing the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\"The core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution,\" the court said. The duties remain in place for now, however.\nWhile Trump's tariffs had initially raised worries about inflation, driving yields higher, the market view changed over the summer with bond investors heartened by the revenue raised from the duties. Tariffs are set to bring in $172.1 billion in 2025, according to the Tax Foundation, which would be a nice financial boost to a country with a ballooning budget deficit.\n\"If this ruling is upheld, refunds of existing tariffs are on the table which could cause a surge in Treasury issuance and yields,\" wrote Ed Mills of Raymond James in a note.\nU.S. yields seemed to be following overseas rates higher, which were increasing for different reasons.\n\"A new wave of sovereign risk is washing over European economies, with the UK and France most vulnerable as they navigate fiscal fragility, political instability, and cratering bond market confidence,\" wrote Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist with Yardeni Research, in a note.\nOn the tariff ruling, Yardeni wrote, \"The Bond Vigilantes might start acting up again if they can no longer look forward to a significant reduction in the federal deficit attributable to tariff revenues.\"\nInvestors will also be anticipating some key economic data this week, namely the nonfarm payrolls report and unemployment rate for August, set to be released Friday morning. It will influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later this month.\nISM's reading of manufacturing strength Tuesday showed contraction, but was a bit better than expected."

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\nLabor Day, according to the Department of Labor, is \u201can annual celebration of the social and economic achievements of American workers.\u201d\nIn the days leading up to this year\u2019s celebration, the Trump administration informed thousands of additional federal workers that it will be dissolving their union.\nIt\u2019s an expansion of a move undertaken back in March to utilize President Donald Trump\u2019s executive authority and citing national security law to argue that people who work in the US Patent and Trademark office, the National Weather Service, NASA, and hydroelectric workers across the country, among others, are too vital to national security to be able to organize.\nThat\u2019s the stated reason, at least. The move is also in line with the Trump administration\u2019s general hostility toward unions and its efforts to strip as many federal workers as possible of collective bargaining rights.\nAs usual with Trump\u2019s audacious use of executive power, there are lawsuits. But the March executive order, which affected a large portion of the unionized federal workforce, has been allowed to proceed after some early setbacks in court.\nTrump doesn\u2019t like American holidays very much\nBack on Juneteenth, the still-new federal observance of the end of slavery, he complained on his social media platform that American workers have too many days off.\nIt\u2019s costing the country too much money to have all these holidays, the president argued. Certainly it\u2019s true that when people don\u2019t work, they\u2019re not productive on that day, but CNN\u2019s Elisabeth Buchwald took a look at the research, some of which suggests having holidays and time off ultimately makes workers more productive in the long run.\nNo August vacation for the president\nTrump himself has not taken significant time away from the White House this month. Presidents traditionally spend at least a week or two in their preferred vacation spot during the month of August. During his first term, Trump would go to his golf club at Bedminster in New Jersey in the summer. This summer, he has golfed almost every weekend, but mostly stayed in Washington, where he has overseen turning the Rose Garden into a patio area and plans to build a $200 million ballroom.\nHe has also still spent plenty of his time in front of television cameras.\nHe had no public events on Friday, but on Tuesday he held a marathon three-plus-hour Cabinet meeting in front of television camera, although more than a working meeting it felt like an opportunity for his Cabinet secretaries to heap over-the-top praise on his leadership.\nOn Monday, he spoke to reporters multiple times at length from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. He also held a joint meeting, including a public session in front of cameras, with the Korean President Lee Jae Myung.\nProductivity is in the eye of the beholder. Trump has certainly produced a fair amount of video content this week. But he might consider spending less time in front of cameras and more time tending portions of the federal government that seem to be teetering.\nHis HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s efforts to undermine vaccines have set off chaos and resignations at the CDC, where Director Susan Monarez was ousted, apparently in a dispute over vaccine policy, despite having been confirmed by the Senate less than a month earlier. Other officials have resigned in protest.\nDuring his own confirmation, Kennedy promised not to throw out US vaccine policy. But his actions since being confirmed, like replacing everyone on a key advisory panel and restricting on-demand access to the Covid-19 vaccine for much of the country, have felt that way.\nAt the Federal Reserve, Trump has tried to fire Governor Lisa Cook over an alleged IRS infraction involving her apparent claim of multiple primary residences, although she has not been charged with any crime.\nThere is what feels like a slow-moving purge of top military officers at the Pentagon underway.\nAnd Trump\u2019s $1-million-a-day callup of the National Guard to patrol Washington, DC \u2014 including low-crime areas like the National Mall \u2014 has DC residents scratching their heads. But it\u2019s a warning to Americans in other cities, such as Chicago and Boston, that there could soon be rifle-toting Guardsmen in their cities too.\nHis administration\u2019s decision to halt work on offshore wind farms that are close to completion, purportedly made for national security reasons, is the opposite of productive since it could drive up energy costs and put thousands of jobs in Rhode Island and Connecticut at risk.\nTrump\u2019s supporters will look at all of this and celebrate the breakneck pace of his second term. Other Americans would prefer he take Labor Day off and plan a vacation."

      "text": "U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday, with investors weighing the latest developments on the trade front to kick off a seasonally poor month for equities. Rising yields also worried investors.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 249.07 points, or 0.55% to close at 45,295.81. The S&P 500 dropped 0.69% to settle at 6,415.54, while the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.82% to close at 21,279.63.\nInvestors took profits on bull market winners with the unofficial end of the summer season. Nvidia shares, for example, closed down about 2%, while other Big Tech names like Amazon and Apple shed around 1%.\nThe moves come after a federal appeals court on Friday ruled that most of Trump's global tariffs are illegal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit determined in a 7-4 ruling that only Congress has the authority to apply sweeping levies. Trump called the decision \"Highly Partisan\" and has said that he will appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nInvestors were also eying a surge in bond yields to start September. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 4.27%, while the 30-year yield topped 4.97%.\nBond investors were driving yields higher on the prospect that the U.S. may have to refund the billions brought in from tariffs, worsening the country's already-stressed fiscal situation.\nThose developments could weigh on sentiment to start a new trading month. September is historically the worst month for equities, with the S&P 500 averaging a 4.2% drop over the last five years, and falling more than 2% on average over the last 10.\n\"A 30-year Treasury of 5% is a headwind, no doubt about it,\" Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird Private Wealth Management, told CNBC. \"I think it'll continue to be a thorn in the side of equities that are trading at fairly stretched valuations.\"\nWall Street is coming off a strong month for the stock market. The S&P 500 rose nearly 2%, climbing above 6,500 for the first time. The big event traders are waiting for is the release of August's jobs report on Friday and how it will influence the Fed's interest rate decision coming mid-month.\nAugust saw the S&P 500 add five new all-time highs, putting the index's year-to-date total at 20, Sam Stovall of CFRA Research noted.\n\"For those years in which the S&P 500 tallied 20 or more new highs through the end of August, the S&P 500 continued to post an average decline in September,\" the firm's chief investment strategist said. \"The market may surrender some recent gains in the near term as it awaits new catalysts.\""

  "argos_summary": "President Trump claimed that stocks need tariffs, but the market reaction has been largely negative, with equity indices falling and Treasury yields spiking as investors worry about the fiscal impact of potential tariff refunds. A federal appeals court ruled most of Trump's tariffs illegal, prompting Trump to seek a Supreme Court appeal. The ruling has heightened uncertainty for U.S. fiscal policy, driving bond yields higher and weighing on equity sentiment.",
