  "description": "Manhattan-based Vessel Technologies is warning Bethel officials that they face expensive litigation if they reject the company\u2019s 75-unit apartment complex.",
  "content": "A wealthy Connecticut suburb is facing down a Manhattan-based real estate development firm that wants to build a 75-unit affordable housing project \u2014 with well-heeled residents calling it an \u201cinsult\u201d to Bethel\u2019s small-town vibes.\n\nThe developer, Manhattan-based Vessel Technologies, is warning officials in the Fairfield County town of Bethel that they face expensive litigation if they reject the company\u2019s five-story, 75-unit apartment complex, the Hartford Courant reported.\n\nThe stark warning came during a heated planning commission meeting last week where Vessel\u2019s attorney delivered a blunt message about the state\u2019s 8-30g law that severely limits towns\u2019 ability to block affordable housing projects.\n\n\u201cAnd the cost of litigation is not something to be just disregarded,\u201d attorney Jason Klein told commissioners last week \u2014 a comment that was perceived by town officials as a threat, the Connecticut Post reported.\n\nVessel wants to construct its signature five-story building on nearly 4.5 acres along Nashville Road, but offered a compromise of just four floors following heavy neighborhood pushback this summer.\n\nBethel residents object to the project, blasting its five-story \u2014 later four-story \u2014 height and 75-unit scale as completely out of step with the town\u2019s low-rise, single-family character.\n\nMany also take issue with the steel-and-glass design, calling it an \u201cinsult to Bethel\u201d and a disruption of the community\u2019s village feel, according to Greenwich Time.\n\nNeighbors also warn of worsening traffic, parking shortages, safety issues, loss of privacy and environmental impacts from stormwater to wildlife.\n\nBethel, in Fairfield County, is about 4.1 square miles with a population of 11,582, according to 2020 Census statistics.\n\nDespite these complaints, officials admit state law leaves them little room to reject the project unless they can prove serious health or safety risks.\n\nVessel has emerged as perhaps Connecticut\u2019s most controversial developer, specializing in stark steel-and-glass buildings and targeting wealthy suburbs with projects that trigger the 8-30g statute.\n\nConnecticut\u2019s 8-30g law makes it easier for developers to build affordable housing in towns where less than 10% of homes meet affordability standards by letting projects override many local zoning rules. The latest figures show Bethel\u2019s affordable housing stock stands at around 5%.\n\nAs of July, the median home price in Bethel was around $582,000, according to realtor websites. These figures mark a sharp year-over-year increase in the town\u2019s housing market.\n\nBethel is also home to some of America\u2019s wealthiest residents. The median household income in Bethel is about $115,135 \u2014 well above the national median household income of $77,700.\n\nVessel has proven ruthlessly willing to sue when communities resist, winning a court-brokered compromise in Simsbury and pursuing active lawsuits against Newtown and Glastonbury.\n\nLast year, Vessel submitted a plan to build two apartment buildings totaling 136 units on Berkshire Road in the Sandy Hook section Newtown \u2014 not far from the elementary school where 26 people, including 20 children, were killed in a mass shooting in 2012.\n\nBut the local Planning & Zoning Commission denied the plan in February, citing the lack of a required \u201cwill-serve\u201d letter from the local water utility, which was under a moratorium after storm damage raised supply concerns.\n\nVessel appealed, arguing there were no true health or safety issues that outweighed the state\u2019s affordable housing mandate, leaving the case to the courts.\n\nTwo years ago, Vessel sued Rocky Hill when officials balked at a five-story building with 30 apartments on a high-visibility site near the planned town center.\n\nNegotiations ultimately led to Vessel relocating to an out-of-the-way location but securing permission for 96 units in exchange.\n\nNow Bethel faces the same playbook after rejecting Newtown\u2019s proposal just six months earlier.\n\nKlein repeatedly hammered commissioners about the legal realities they face under 8-30g.\n\n\u201c8-30g is the law and it\u2019s important to follow the law, so we want to make sure the record is clear,\u201d Klein warned.\n\n\u201cCase law is very clear: To find a health and safety concern, it has to be more than a mere theoretical possibility. Mere concern alone is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nThe Post has sought comment from Vessel and Bethel.",

You were a respite from that.\n\u201cEarly on, you referenced serial killing multiple times in ways people normally don\u2019t. That immediately appealed to me.\u201d\nDespite his love of serial killers and his apparent hatred for children, Lanza wrote that he would be a \u201cphenomenal father\u201d because he would encourage them to think freely.\nPersonal documents from Lanza\u2019s home computer and medical reports \u2014 both released by Connecticut police \u2014 show that Lanza was primed to kill.\nHis deteriorated mental health, obsession with violence and access to his mother\u2019s guns \u201cproved a recipe for mass murder,\u201d concluded a report by Connecticut\u2019s Office of Child Advocate.\nLanza showed signs of trouble at a young age.\nHis linguistic skills were delayed early, and while his reading comprehension eventually improved, he never displayed a \u201cgrasp of empathy for characters motives, feelings or perspectives,\u201d the report said.\nLanza\u2019s troubled mental state loomed over his own creative endeavors, too.\nHe wrote a violent book in fifth grade that described harming children, and was also working on a screenplay called \u201cLovebound\u2019\u2019 that centered on \u201cthe beauty in the romantic relationship between a 10-year-old boy and a 30-year-old man.\u201d\nLanza claimed he was \u201cmolested at least a dozen times\u201d by doctors during genital exams, all with his parents\u2019 knowledge.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how I and every child was not raped by doctors: We did not consent to it. We only did it because our parents made us,\u201d he wrote."

Median household income was highest in 2019 among the years for which data is available.\n2020 data is excluded due to problems in data collection caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBetween 2022 and 2023, median household income decreased less than 1% to $77.7K.\nMedian household income, adjusted for inflation (2023 dollars)\nThe median household income is a useful summary, but it doesn\u2019t fully capture the income landscape.

      "text": "Zohran Mamdani wants to end all misdemeanor charges: \u2018E-ZPass for criminals\u2019\nDemocratic mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani and his comrades at the Democratic Socialists of America want to wipe out the enforcement of all misdemeanor offenses, The Post has learned.\nIn its most recent platform, the group blasts policing and detention as \u201cinstruments of class war\u201d designed to \u201cguarantee the domination of the working class\u201d \u2014 and demands an end what it calls \u201cthe criminalization of working-class survival.\u201d\n\u201cFor all of the working class to achieve collective liberation we must constrain, diminish, and abolish the carceral forces of the state \u2014 from prisons and police themselves, to their manifestations in all forms throughout society,\u201d according to the national party\u2019s latest platform, adopted in 2021.\nOn the campaign trail, Mamdani has repeatedly called for police to stop focusing on what he\u2019s referred to as \u201cnon serious crimes.\u201d\n\u201cPolice have a critical role to play but right now we\u2019re relying on them to deal with the failures of our social safety net, which is preventing them from doing their actual jobs,\u201d he said in a campaign video posted to X Wednesday.\nThe DSA has also pushed to slash arrests, gut prosecutors\u2019 budgets, abolish cash bail and all forms of pre-trial detention, scrap electronic monitoring, and end imprisonment for parole violations.\nMamdani, a Queens assemblyman and member of the NYC chapter of the DSA and its endorsed mayoral candidate, has questioned the purpose of prisons and repeatedly called to roll back punishment on so-called \u201cnon-violent offenses\u201d \u2013 both as an Albany lawmaker and in his Gotham mayoral campaign.\nHe doubled down on his longstanding push to legalize prostitution this week.\nOn the campaign trail, Mamdani backtracked from his prior \u2018defund the police\u2019 views in the wake of the Park Avenue massacre, insisting he\u2019d keep the NYPD roughly at its current size and redirect officers to focus only on \u201cserious\u201d crimes.\nCritics remain unconvinced he can lead law enforcement and tame NYC crime.\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy for a second that he is moderated on any of these policing questions because he has yet to really articulate in any deep way why he\u2019s moderated or how he\u2019s moderated,\u201d said Rafael Mangual, a legal policy expert at the Manhattan Institute. \u201cAll he has really said is that he no longer wants to defund the police, even though police and prison and jail abolition are core tenets of the DSA party platform.\u201d\nAnd Mamdani has even tried to challenge the definition of a violent offense.\n\u201cWhat violent crime is \u2013 is defined by the state,\u201d he said at a 2021 protest outside the Manhattan DA\u2019s office to nix cash bail and shut down Rikers \u2013 a promise he\u2019s still making. \u201d Violence is an artificial construction,\u201d he said at the time.\nThe misdemeanors the DSA wants to erase aren\u2019t minor slip-ups. In the Empire State, they include theft or shoplifting up to $1,000, drug possession, assault without a weapon and even driving while intoxicated.\n\u201cThey\u2019re driving the city into a hole that\u2019s never going to recover,\u201d said Susan Ginsburg, a resident of Greenwich Village, which has descended into a lawless drug den since soft on crime policies created what neighbors have decried as a revolving door of justice.\n\u201cPeople will break the law with impunity. There has to be deterrent for breaking the law,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing that we\u2019re even having this conversation,\u201d said Maria Danzilo, an Upper West Side resident who ran in the Democratic primary for state Senate in 2022 and founded the group One City Rising.\n\u201cEverybody is so sick and tired of this, and we just want to have a normal, functional, reasonable way of getting through our day without worrying about being hurt. This is exactly the opposite of what New Yorkers need right now.\u201d\nTo end misdemeanor arrests, Albany would have to pass a bill decriminalizing or downgrading those charges.\nGov. Hochul \u2013 who has yet to endorse her fellow Democrat \u2013 doesn\u2019t back defunding the police.\nIf elected mayor, Mamdani can\u2019t change state laws, but does have influence over how they\u2019re enforced. He could force the NYPD to deprioritize certain arrests or pressure district attorneys not to prosecute certain cases \u2013 much like Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg did in his controversial \u201cday one\u201d memo telling staff to go soft on armed robberies and drug dealing.\n\u201cThat will create an EZ-Pass for criminals, enabling them to repeatedly commit misdemeanor crimes,\u201d lambasted Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa. \u201cThis will make the police even less effective at enforcement. Ultimately, this will cause the quality of life to decline dramatically, leading to a breakdown of law and order and resulting in chaos and disorder.\u201d\nNew Yorkers like Chelsea resident Alexander Kaplan are stunned by the pro-crime push.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just difficult to imagine how adults in their right mind could come up with it. I\u2019m not exaggerating, I\u2019m completely serious,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re already suffering from terrible crime. This is going to make it a thousand times worse. And perception matters \u2013 just the notion of this would embolden criminals.\u201d\nMamdani\u2019s campaign and the DSA did not respond to The Post\u2019s request for comment."

Let us strive to honor them today and every day.\u201d\nLongobucco read out all 20 names of the students who are forever first-graders followed by a moment of silence as attendees bowed their heads.\nAbout 60 of the class of 335 graduates \u2014 who pinned green ribbons emblazoned with \u201cForever in Our Hearts\u201d on their gowns \u2014 were former classmates of the victims at Sandy Hook Elementary School and survived the Dec. 14, 2012 shooting that also killed six educators.\n\u201cTo graduate and miss 20 kids out of your class, there\u2019s no way to go about it without remembering them,\u201d 17-year-old Sandy Hook survivor and graduate Lilly Wasilnak told People Magazine.\nAnother graduating survivor, Matt Holden, said he thinks of grief in the moments unseen \u2014 the ones missed by the 20 students who should still be here, turning their tassels from one side to another, and in the smaller moments that are part of growing up.\n\u201cYou can always see the moments when someone\u2019s crying at the memorial or something like that, but every single day there are a thousand moments that you don\u2019t even think about, where they should be here,\u201d Holden told the Hartford Courant. \u201cThe empty seat at the lunch table, or the kid you don\u2019t see in the halls, that\u2019s what really defines it.\n\u201cSome people who didn\u2019t even meet these kids, who went to another school in town, are affected by this. Not because they knew them, but because they should have,\u201d he added. \u201cBecause we all should have gotten to know them better than we did.\u201d\n\u201cThey should still be here and that\u2019s the greatest tragedy of all,\u201d Holden said.\nParents of those killed painfully marked what should have been the day they celebrated their teenagers at events advocating for resources to prevent shootings in the days before graduation, the Courant reported.\n\u201cThis is a hard month because there should be twenty more kids graduating,\u201d said Nicole Hockley, whose son Dylan was killed. \u201cDylan should be graduating. And [Principal] Dawn [Hochsprung] and the others should all be here watching them graduate.\u201d\nFor many of the young survivors \u2014 who at just 6 years old witnessed or heard their peers and teachers being slaughtered \u2014 the shooting has impacted their whole life and future career paths.\n\u201cThis is the generation that has grown up knowing nothing but school shootings,\u201d Hockley said, according to the Courant. \u201cThis is the generation that will not let that be the future for their children.\u201d"

A lifetime of hard work vs. a silver spoon. The results speak for themselves,\u201d Adams wrote on X.\n\u201cThe weight of the job is too heavy for \u201cMamscrawny.\u201d The only thing he can lift is your taxes,\u201d Adams charged.\nIndependent candidate for mayor Andrew Cuomo also roasted Mamdani for the embarrassing display.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to talk, it\u2019s hard to carry the burden,\u201d Cuomo wrote on X, quoting The Post\u2019s report. Unlike Adams, Cuomo provided no evidence of his own bench press prowess in his X post.\n\u201cThis guy can\u2019t bench his own body weight, let alone carry the weight of leading the most important city in the world.\u201d\nThe 2025 frontrunner for mayor also walked down Eastern Parkway as part of an open streets event, taking hundreds of selfies as he passed the Brooklyn Museum.\nWhile he may have floundered at the test of strength, Mamdani showed some skill with the soccer ball, the national sport of Uganda, where he was born and recently married.\nVideo showed Mamdani taking off his designer boots to more expertly kick the stranger\u2019s soccer ball at an inflatable target.\nAfter ditching the boots, he vigorously kicked a soccer ball at a giant inflatable dart board set up by organizers at the open streets event near the Brooklyn Museum.\nMamdani also dropped in on a DJ\u2019s set and delivered remarks to dozens of Brooklynites.\n\u201cIt is such a pleasure to be here, and I want to say thank you to the organizers for celebrating what makes this community beautiful,\u201d Mamdani said in brief remarks.\n\u201cI look forward to being your next mayor, next year,\u201d he concluded.\nMen\u2019s Day is an annual open streets event featuring outdoor gyms, music performances, and car shows, which occurs towards the end of each summer."

I\u2019m an AG!\u201d Flanagan told police as they tried to detain her for failing to comply with their demands.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to regret this. You\u2019re going to regret it.

She embarrassed all of them,\u201d Neronah told WPRO Radio following Flanagan\u2019s arrest.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really hard to find and keep capable lawyers, and so I just have to think really carefully about this one. But no question there will be a strong, strong sanction here,\u201d he added.\nWhile Neronha said he believed Flanagan may have been under the influence of alcohol during the incident, he said it doesn\u2019t excuse the behavior.\nThe AG also issued an apology to the Newport Police Department over the incident.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what she was thinking. Clearly, she was not thinking straight,\u201d Neronha said.\n\u201cShe\u2019s humiliated herself. Regardless of what happens vis-a-vis her employment with us, she\u2019s going to have a long time coming back from this,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just really unfortunate.\u201d\nWith Post wires"

Vessel\u2019s attorney threatened that rejecting the project could trigger expensive court battles, while locals argue the steel\u2011and\u2011glass, multi\u2011story building would clash with Bethel\u2019s low\u2011rise, single\u2011family character and worsen traffic, parking, and environmental concerns. The town, which has a median home price of about $583,000 and a median household income of $115,000, has little legal room to refuse the project unless serious health or safety risks can be proven. The article also touches on broader regional issues, including Vessel\u2019s history of suing communities, the 8\u201130g statute\u2019s impact on affordable\u2011housing stock, and contextual data about Bethel\u2019s housing market and demographic profile.",
