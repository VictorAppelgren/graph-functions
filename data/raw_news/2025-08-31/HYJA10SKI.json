  "title": "Will The Fed Cut Interest Rates? Does It Matter? Recent History Says No.",
  "description": "The normal relationship between the Fed\u2019s interest rate policy and various market rates \u2013 the ones that matter for consumers and businesses \u2013 has broken down.",
  "content": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s most important monetary policy tool is the Fed Funds Interest Rate target. By raising or lowering this benchmark, the Fed hopes to influence the cost of credit throughout the economy, to stimulate or restrain, to control inflation and promote full employment. It is widely assumed that the Fed Funds Rate is an effective lever to move market interest rates, both short-term and long-term rates. For decades, that assumption appeared to hold up.\n\nNo longer. This critical policy lever is broken. It stopped working quite suddenly about a year ago. The Fed lowered its target rate three times from September to December 2024, and is getting ready to lower it further \u2013 but real interest rates in the market have moved decisively upwards. The correlations between the policy rate and the most important market rates (like Treasury yields and mortgage rates) flipped from extremely positive (i.e, strongly synchronized) prior to September of last year to extremely negative (moving in opposite directions) almost overnight. It is not clear if the breakdown of this long-standing relationship is temporary (\u201ctransitory\u201d?) or if it represents a structural shift in the way the macroeconomic system operates. If it is structural, it would mean that the Fed has lost some of its ability to influence the economy. Which could have momentous consequences.\n\nThe financial markets are treating the prospect of a rate cut next month as a psychological event. Market sentiment surrounding this prospect is decidedly positive. But viewed as a fundamental economic event, the outlook is cloudy. Last year\u2019s cuts have not worked as a stimulus \u2013 have not lowered important market interest rates, and appear in fact to have pushed them higher. Why should a different outcome be expected this time?\n\nAs summer comes to an end, the attention of the financial world is locked in on the Federal Reserve, and the possibility of an interest rate cut in September.\n\nThe markets are pretty well convinced. Investors have been positioning for a cut for weeks. \u201cBets on Fed Rate Cuts Are Sweeping Through US Bond Market\u201d was a Bloomberg headline earlier this month, and that was even before Chairman Powell teased in his Jackson Hole speech that \u201ca shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance\u201d \u2013 classic Fedspeak which the markets took as a Yes, and bid up the value of U.S. equities by about a trillion dollars that same day. The President has been leaning hard on Fed Chairman Powell to reduce rates, and the pressure to cut is building within the Fed itself. Two Fed Governors dissented from the no-change consensus at the July Federal Open Market Committee meeting and voted for a cut \u2013 the first time since 1993 that two FOMC members have broken ranks on a key policy decision.\n\nTechnical metrics and forecasts are flashing green. CME\u2019s FedWatch tool puts the chance of a September rate cut at 87% (up from 60% a month ago). Other financial industry estimates approach near-certainty. Prediction markets are currently showing a 75-80% probability of a 25 bps reduction in the Fed Funds target, and many professional traders are betting on a larger move. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has projected the possibility of a 50 bps cut \u2013 on a downward path to 150-175 bps lower soon.\n\nSo, will it happen? It seems so.\n\nBut the more important question is: If or when it does happen, will it actually matter?\n\nLet\u2019s go back a year. On September 16, 2024, after a long period of quiescence in interest rate policy, the Federal Reserve finally lowered the Fed Funds Rate target \u2013 the first downshift in more than 4 years. It was intended as a stimulus, or an easing of restraint. The normal expectation would have been for market interest rates to move downwards as well, lowering the cost of credit for consumers and businesses to encourage borrowing and spending. Lower rates on treasury bonds would reduce the cost of funding the federal government. Lower mortgage rates would unlock the stalled housing market. Cutting the Fed Funds target is the normal policy tool for this purpose. It has almost always worked before.\n\nNot this time. The rate cut on Sept 16 triggered a rapid and pronounced rise in the yields on Treasury bonds, and a similar steep increase in average mortgage rates. In just 6 weeks, both long-term rates lurched upwards.\n\nTwo more rate cuts followed in November and December, dropping the Fed Funds rate by a total of 100 basis points in three months. The long-term market rates continued to surge upwards, bolting higher with each rate reduction.\n\nThe gap between the policy rate and the most important long-term market rates ballooned by more than 2 full percentage points.\n\nThe rise in treasury bond yields and mortgage rates leveled off after January, but the gap has not closed.\n\nSince 1972, the Fed Funds Rate has been almost perfectly correlated with the 10-year Treasury Bond yield (90.4%) and the 30-year mortgage interest rate (91.6%). That relationship has broken down.\n\nTreasury yields and mortgage rates were inversely correlated with the Fed\u2019s policy rate from September 2024 to to January 2025 \u2013 strongly so, at negative 80-90%.\n\nCorporate bond yields followed the same pattern, as did \u2013 strangely \u2013 German and British government bond yields.\n\nAcross all these markets, the shift in direction was decisive \u2013 from moving with the Fed prior to the first rate cut, to moving strongly against the Fed afterwards. The reversal of the long-established pattern was abrupt and definitive.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, thsi means that the Fed has been unable to effect a monetary stimulus by the traditional means. The rate cuts backfired, probably helping to drive up the cost of credit in the economy.\n\nIt is true that certain short term rates such as the interest rate on auto loans, rates on personal bank loans, and credit card interest appear to have moved downward with the Fed\u2019s rate cuts. The so-called Prime Rate has move down as well. But it is the long-term rates that apply to the largest credit markets. Treasury bonds, municipal bonds, residential and commercial mortgages, and corporate loans and debt securities \u2013 which have all moved against the Fed\u2019s rate cuts \u2013 account for about 25 times the amount of interest bearing debt compared to the categories that have moved in sync with the Fed Funds Rate.\n\nThe Federal Reserve may be trying to drive a car with a gas pedal that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThis has happened before. In February 2005, in the course of Congressional testimony then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan mused about a \u201cconundrum\u201d in the bond market. The Fed had raised the Fed Funds target rate by 150 basis points between June 29, 2004 and February 2, 2005 \u2013 but the yields in the Treasury market did not rise \u2013 which was the Fed\u2019s policy goal. Instead they fell by 70 bps, contrary to the long-established pattern and to the Fed Chairman\u2019s expectations.\n\nIt got worse. Over the next two and a half years the Federal Reserve raised the Fed Funds target rate by a whopping 425 basis points \u2013 and the 10 year Treasury yields ended about 5% lower than when the rate increases began.\n\nThe phenomenon spurred a fairly large \u201cconundrum literature\u201d over the following dozen or so years \u2014 and a surfeit of alternative explanations with no clear winner. It wasn\u2019t just academic economists who were flummoxed. Bill Gross, then-head of Pimco and a true bond market expert, was just as puzzled.\n\nToday\u2019s anomaly is if anything even more of a departure from the norm than the 2004-2005 episode. Greenspan\u2019s \u201cconundrum\u201d involved a non-response by the market to Fed policy. The divergence of important market rates from Fed policy rates in the last 11 months constitutes a strong contrary response.\n\nDoes the Fed\u2019s Interest Rate policy lever really work?\n\nTwo large doubts loom over this question.\n\n1. Why Should Short-Term Rate Adjustments Affect the Long-Term Rates Anyway?\n\nThe Fed Funds Rate is a target, intended to guide the cost at which member banks lend reserves to one another overnight. It addresses the very shortest of short-term rates \u2013 less than 24 hours. It pertains to a limited and peculiar form of credit. The interbank lending to which it applies is not connected to any \u201cinvestment\u201d or other ordinary business purposes in the larger economy, at least not directly. It is a process of technical calibration, designed to allow banks to stay in compliance with reserve requirements and manage liquidity \u2013 essentially to keep their cash balance in good order for purposes of regulatory conformance and general prudence.\n\nThere has always been something slightly preposterous about the idea that these ultra-short-term interest rates, which apply to such functionally narrow transactions between huge banks taking place deep inside the Federal Reserve system, could somehow decisively influence the interest rates on, say, 30-year mortgages prevailing out in the vast consumer housing market. And aside from the timing disparity between \u201covernight\u201d adjustments and loans lasting decades, there is also a disparity in scale. The average daily volume of overnight bank funding is about $200-250 Billion. The combined long-term credit markets described above total more than $70 Trillion. Can such a tiny tail wag such a gigantic dog?\n\nAcademic studies of \u201ctransmission mechanisms\u201d between short-term policy rate changes and long-term market rate responses have tried to make sense of this policy proposition, but in the end they present a complex and less-than-coherent picture. One study published by the Kansas City Federal Reserve put it this way:\n\nThere is another confounding factor that may offset the stimulus effect of interest rate cuts altogether. In April 2022, after at least four rounds of massive bond buying in the previous 12 years (so-called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d), the Fed\u2019s balance sheet peaked at almost $9 Trillion, and then began to decline as the Fed allowed maturing bonds to \u201croll off\u201d (mature without replacement). The yield curve almost immediately ticked into an inverted state, recovered briefly and then two months later entered the longest period of inversion in history. It only ended in September 2024, just when the Fed began reducing the Fed Funds target rate. By then this process of \u201cquantitative tightening\u201d (QT) had reduced the Fed\u2019s balance sheet by almost $2 Trillion.\n\nIn the 11 months since the first rate cut, another half a trillion dollars of bonds have rolled off \u2013 in effect, removing a half a trillion dollars of demand from the bond market. Less demand means lower prices, which means higher yields. How much higher? One recent study calculated that a $1 Trillion reduction in the Fed\u2019s bond holdings would increase the 10-year Treasury yield by 200 basis points \u2013 which is almost exactly what we see (half a trillion dollars => 100 basis points rise in yields).\n\nThe Fed is pursuing two contradictory policies at the same time. It is attempting to ease credit conditions by cutting interest rates, and it is tightening credit conditions through QT.\n\nTo return to the previous metaphor \u2014 maybe the gas pedal on this vehicle isn\u2019t broken. Maybe it\u2019s just that the Fed is driving with one foot on the gas and one on the brake at the same time.\n\nMarket interest rates have not responded to the past three interest rate cuts in the way policy makers at the Federal Reserve intended. Instead of lower borrowing costs, the result has been significantly higher cost of credit for consumers and businesses in all the most important categories: Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, mortgage rates.\n\nShould we expect a different outcome from the next rate cut in September (or whenever)? Does the Fed\u2019s interest rate policy still have a meaningful influence over broader credit conditions? Current evidence would say No.",

      "text": "The overnight bank funding rate is a measure of wholesale, unsecured, overnight bank funding costs. It is calculated using federal funds transactions, certain Eurodollar transactions, and certain domestic deposit transactions, all as reported in the FR 2420 Report of Selected Money Market Rates. The federal funds market consists of domestic unsecured borrowings in U.S. dollars by depository institutions from other depository institutions and certain other entities, primarily government-sponsored enterprises. The Eurodollar market consists of unsecured U.S. dollar deposits held at banks or bank branches outside of the United States. U.S.-based banks can also take Eurodollar deposits domestically through international banking facilities (IBFs). Also included in the calculation of the OBFR are U.S. dollar deposits with a fixed overnight term and a negotiated interest rate that are booked in U.S. offices of banks. These transactions are collected in the FR 2420 under Part D, \"Selected Deposits.\"\nThe overnight bank funding rate (OBFR) is calculated as a volume-weighted median of overnight federal funds transactions, Eurodollar transactions, and the domestic deposits reported as \u201cSelected Deposits\u201d in the FR 2420 Report. The New York Fed publishes the OBFR for the prior business day on the New York Fed website at approximately 9:00 a.m.\nFor more information on the OBFR\u2019s publication schedule and methodology, see Additional Information about Reference Rates Administered by the New York Fed."

  "argos_summary": "The article argues that the Federal Reserve\u2019s Fed Funds rate cuts, which historically lowered long\u2011term rates, have stopped working since September\u202f2024. After three cuts, Treasury yields, mortgage rates, and corporate bonds rose instead of falling, reversing a long\u2011standing positive correlation. The author attributes this to simultaneous quantitative tightening and a possible structural shift in the transmission mechanism, suggesting the Fed\u2019s policy lever may now be ineffective. Market expectations still favor a September cut, but the evidence indicates it may not lower borrowing costs as intended.",
