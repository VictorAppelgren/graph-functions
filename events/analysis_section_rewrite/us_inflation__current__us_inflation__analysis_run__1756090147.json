      "feedback": "This draft earns strength for anchoring in 0–3 weeks with clear policy/market catalysts and solid numbers, but it needs a tighter, more disciplined causal chain, a sharper near-term catalyst set, and a clean, source-faithful citation frame. Edits to upgrade to world-class quality: (1) Clarify the immediate causal chain from Powell’s rate-cut hint to risk-on pricing, then to index momentum, using the exact numbers: CME/Market data show ~85% odds of a 25bp September cut (not just “a rally”), and the Dow/Nasdaq hit fresh highs on that backdrop (17F49LURJ;). Tie this to a concrete reaction function: if the cut odds hold, expect continued equity breadth but if data surprise hawkishly, volatility spikes rather than rally; (2) Center catalysts at verifiable near-term events with numbers: Nvidia print date and consensus, Santos’ H1 metrics plus Pikka first oil now guided to Q1 2026, Barossa 98% complete, LNG realized price US$11.57/mmbtu; quantify the cash-flow/production kicker and how that feeds equity/credit risk appetite (S1OY7ISLY); (3) Build a first-principles macro frame: tariff/inflation risk vs AI-driven productivity; Krugman’s stagflation risk is the explicit counterweight to AI uplift, so frame scenarios around productivity surprises and inflation credibility, with explicit thresholds tied to Fed guidance (218AGGUXB); (4) Add a compact three‑scenario structure (base/bull/bear) with explicit watchpoints and invalidation tests (e.g., if August payrolls/inflation prints surprise to the upside, if Nvidia underperforms, if Barossa/Pikka timelines slip); (5) Sharpen the near-term levels/thresholds to monitor: use the 45,631.74 Dow level and the 85% cut odds as definition anchors; monitor Nvidia earnings, Santos milestones, August jobs release and CPI print, and any new intel on the Trump/regulatory backdrop; (6) Improve number discipline and avoid non-source anecdotes: replace any D3/D4 placeholders with the IDs that actually exist in the material (17F49LURJ; S1OY7ISLY; 218AGGUXB; LLN6N4H3Z; QWWRYUZYR); avoid unrelated items like paywall-ridden prescriptives or nonessential startup financing gets; (7) Tighten coverage of all critical sources and reconcile conflicts: Krugman’s stagflation warning vs market pricing of cuts; Santos’ cash-flow/production lift vs impairment and cost base; energy-regulatory cost pressures vs potential policy reversals; present these as explicit cross-asset risk vectors rather than a loose narrative. In short, rewrite to a crisp base-case with explicit catalysts, levels, invalidation, and monitoring; anchor every claim to a cited ID (17F49LURJ; S1OY7ISLY; 218AGGUXB; LLN6N4H3Z; QWWRYUZYR).",
