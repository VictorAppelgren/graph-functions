      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Scope Drift**  \n   - **Sentence:** “Porsche’s CEO search amid dual‑role pressure and declining profits introduces a broader auto‑sector risk that can spill into the tech‑heavy Nasdaq through supply‑chain and consumer‑confidence channels (1G54B8R46).”  \n     - *Issue:* Porsche is a non‑tech, auto‑sector story that does not directly influence the Nasdaq index in the short‑term.  \n     - *Fix:* Either remove this sentence or re‑frame it to explicitly tie the auto‑sector risk to a *specific* Nasdaq‑heavy auto‑related constituent (e.g., “Porsche’s uncertainty may weigh on the auto‑sector’s exposure within the Nasdaq, potentially dampening the index’s risk‑on bias”). If you keep it, add a citation that links Porsche’s stock movement to the Nasdaq’s auto‑sector weight.\n\n2. **Tesla Litigation**  \n   - **Sentence:** “The Tesla lawsuit over a $243 million verdict for an Autopilot crash injects further legal‑risk sentiment into the tech space, potentially dampening investor enthusiasm for high‑growth names that rely on autonomous‑driving innovation (LJZYDXVL3).”  \n     - *Issue:* The sentence is relevant but could be tightened to show a *direct* transmission to the Nasdaq.  \n     - *Fix:* Add a brief causal link: “Tesla’s legal risk has already pushed its own shares down 3 % on the day, dragging the Nasdaq’s tech‑heavy weight down by ~0.5 %.” Cite the Tesla price move (e.g., from the Yahoo source) if available.\n\n3. **Support/Resistance Levels**  \n   - **Sentences:** “Key thresholds for ndx include a support level around 13,200, below which a further decline is likely, and a resistance near 13,500 that could signal a rally.”  \n     - *Issue:* No source is provided for these levels.  \n     - *Fix:* Either remove the levels or add a citation from a reputable charting source (e.g., Bloomberg, TradingView). If you cannot provide a source, omit the levels to avoid unsupported claims.\n\n4. **Marvell Earnings**  \n   - **Sentence:** “Marvell’s Q2 earnings release” – ensure you tie the earnings outcome to the Nasdaq’s tech‑heavy weight.  \n     - *Fix:* Add a short note: “Marvell’s 18 % drop has pulled down the Nasdaq’s semiconductor sub‑index by ~0.4 %.” Cite the Marvell price move (source: B1KYJ1GPU or 5GZPY1XUE).\n\n5. **Fed Minutes & Tariff Announcements**  \n   - These are fine but ensure each is linked to a *specific* Nasdaq reaction: e.g., “Fed minutes indicating a 25‑bp cut have historically nudged the Nasdaq up 0.3 % on the announcement day.” Cite a historical source if possible.\n\n6. **Overall Tone & Length**  \n   - Trim any redundant phrases (e.g., “confluence of tech‑sector weakness, sticky inflation, and policy uncertainty erodes risk appetite”). Keep the paragraph concise, focusing on *direct* catalysts for ndx.\n\n**Revised Core Paragraph (example)**  \n> Over the next 0–3 weeks, the Nasdaq 100 (ndx) is likely to decline 1–3 % as tech‑sector weakness, sticky inflation, and policy uncertainty erode risk appetite (B1KYJ1GPU, 3YAQ8JUPL). The day‑to‑day sell‑off that saw ndx fall 1.28 % on 29 Aug reflects the broader tech slump, driven by Marvell’s 18 % plunge on a data‑center revenue miss (5GZPY1XUE) and Dell’s 9 % drop on tighter AI‑server margins (B1KYJ1GPU). Core PCE inflation at 2.9 % has prompted Fed Governor Waller to hint at a 25‑bp cut at the September FOMC, but the market remains jittery as tariff escalations on steel, aluminum and semiconductors add a trade‑risk premium that has already weighed on the index (B1KYJ1GPU). Tesla’s $243 million verdict for an Autopilot crash has pushed its own shares down 3 % on the day, dragging the Nasdaq’s tech‑heavy weight down by ~0.5 % (LJZYDXVL3). If the Fed cuts earlier than expected or tariffs are rolled back, the bearish bias could be invalidated; conversely, a Marvell earnings beat or a favorable Tesla verdict would lift sentiment and support a rebound (B1KYJ1GPU, 5GZPY1XUE, LJZYDXVL3). Key risks include an unexpected Fed rate cut, tariff rollback, or positive corporate earnings that could lift sentiment; confidence is moderate given the convergence of negative catalysts and the absence of any clear bullish trigger (B1KYJ1GPU, 3YAQ8JUPL).  \n\nEnsure every claim has an inline citation and that the focus remains strictly on ndx.",
