      "feedback": "Strong regime framing and source anchoring are evident, but the piece fails to deliver a concise, decision-ready house view in 4–6 sentences and overrotates to descriptive regime mapping at the expense of actionable investment thinking. To upgrade: condense into a single, 4–6 sentence house view that positions ETH as the core long-duration asset, ties its valuation path to a quantified real-rate/discount-rate trajectory under the Fed’s 2% target (OGK8WLL69), and flags explicit catalysts (GENIUS Act, Project Crypto; ETF/inflows; corporate treasury activity) with precise numbers (ETH ~4,955; BTC near record; July ETH ETF inflows in the “several billions”; staking ~one-third of ETH) anchored to OGK8WLL69 and 22PL3Q360. Replace the four-regime map with a tight, probability-weighted scenario tree (e.g., Regime A: disinflation/easing, Regime B: inflation surprise/tightening, Regime C: regulatory clarity boosts demand, Regime D: policy error/macro shock) with explicit transition triggers (CPI prints, FOMC timing, major regulatory or trade news) and assign rough weights to each (to avoid vagueness). Rebuild the Base/Alt sections into a single near-term framework (0–3/3–6 months) focused on price-path sensitivity to discount rates, with 1–2 key numbers per claim, and purge extraneous macro content (e.g., UBI/identity lines) that do not feed ETH valuation. Ensure every factual claim cites an IDs-only source (OGK8WLL69; 22PL3Q360; Scraped Source 4; NL5YYTLF2; ILYC1M41F; UPV3X2MQ6; EPJYXB7DX; YQOMV2HAJ; V8TEZOR8R; 17F49LURJ; 218AGGUXB; T1QE6JPIX; R3WNA7L7A; JPAIHPA4N; SGB2PAZGK; LLN6N4H3Z; Y6SQOEK69) and reconcile any source conflicts by selecting a single macro baseline for the base case and clearly labeling any alternative paths with probabilities. Finally, present a crisp watch-list with 4 concrete triggers and 1–2 validation tests (e.g., SEP FOMC trajectory, ETH ETF inflow run-rate, staking/composition shifts, regulatory milestones) to keep the thesis actionable and decision-useful.",
