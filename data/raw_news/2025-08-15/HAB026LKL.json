  "title": "Donald Trump's reaction to Putin walking towards him leaves people livid",
  "description": "US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin met for over an hour in the remote Alaskan city of Anchorage on the sidelines of the Arctic Council summit",
  "content": "Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have convened in Alaska to deliberate on various contentious matters including the Ukraine conflict. The US President remains resolute in achieving a ceasefire and insists he \"won't be happy\" if an agreement isn't reached. Nevertheless, despite these assertive declarations, proceedings appeared remarkably amicable when the two global leaders encountered each other on the tarmac today (August 15). As a smiling Putin approached Trump along the red carpet, he was greeted with enthusiastic applause from the 79-year-old American. The world leaders exchanged handshakes before strolling towards their shared transfer vehicle, whilst engaging in relaxed conversation along the way.\n\nThey momentarily paused for photographs and seemed to disregard the pointed enquiries shouted by journalists present. Reporters waiting to see the presidents fired a series of questions at them, one asked: \"President Putin, will you stop killing civilians?\" In a chilling response, Putin shrugged and pointed to his ear. Presumably, the leader was making out he is not equipped with an ear piece for translations. That wasn't the only uncomfortable moment. Onlookers expressed profound unease that Putin \u2013 who faces allegations of being a 'war criminal' \u2013 received such a cordial reception in Alaska. Some observers went so far as to describe the meeting as nauseating. One individual shared a vomiting emoji alongside the comment: \"Trump just clapped as Putin was coming towards him, and then they did a lovey dovey smiley handshake.\"\n\nAnother critic declared: \"Trump applauded like an exciting school boy, multiple times, as Putin was walking towards him. This is the sickest s*** ever.\" A third observer noted: \"He has zero social etiquette. WTF is he clapping for?\". Yet another commented: \"Putin wins. He made it to the US. Even got Trump to clap for him. Disgusting.\" Defending the applause, a Trump supporter stated: \"Because he is in a diplomatic mission, welcoming a head of state, because he hopes to accomplish something good and wants Putin to feel welcome. That is what real leaders and real heads of states do.\"",
