  "description": "Former Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban ruled out 2028 presidential bid but would reconsider if Trump attempts to run for a third term, preferring to focus on his family.",
  "content": "Former \"Shark Tank\" investor Mark Cuban declared on Friday he will not run for the presidency unless President Donald Trump tries to run for an unprecedented third term.\n\nSince their disastrous defeat in the 2024 election, the Democratic Party has been struggling to find a new leader or ideological party line to rally around. Cuban, formerly a Harris campaign surrogate, is one of many political outsiders who have been mentioned as potential 2028 candidates.\n\nBut when Ben Smith asked Cuban about a run on the Semafor podcast, the billionaire rejected the idea.\n\n\"I'm not going to do it,\" Cuban replied. \"I've said the only way I would do it is if Trump tried to run for a third term. Because then that's just changing everything, right? And that's a true threat.\"\n\nWhile Trump has hinted that his vice president, J.D. Vance, is \"probably favored\" to be his successor, he has both teased and distanced himself from the idea of a third term.\n\n\"I got the highest vote in the history of Texas, a record that they say won't be beaten unless I run again,\" Trump said during an early August interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nAsked if he was going to run again, Trump responded, \"No, probably not. Probably not.\"\n\n\"But other than that, I'm not going to put my family through that, you know?\" Cuban said, noting further that his three kids are between the ages of 15 and 21 and he would prefer to avoid the amount of \"grief and abuse\" that comes with running for president.\n\n\"When I'm 95 and taking - or 105 and taking my last breaths, right? I don't want to say, \u2018Well, gee, I ran for president. Maybe won, maybe didn't,\u2019\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen asked who he actually favors to run in 2028, Cuban suggested names like Scott Galloway, Jon Stewart and Texas state Rep. James Talarico.\n\n\"But in terms of traditional politicians that we\u2019ve seen? Meh,\" he said, expressing distaste.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump answered Tuesday whether he would try to campaign for the White House a fourth time around.\nDuring a phone interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" Trump was discussing Bureau of Labor Statistics job numbers that he argues were \"rigged\" during the 2024 presidential election to inflate former President Joe Biden's economic performance. While discussing gerrymandering, Trump said he \"got the highest vote in the history of Texas\" \u2013 a claim CNBC anchorman Joe Kernen initially challenged but then admitted a network fact-check showed Trump did get the highest number of votes in Texas.\n\"I got the highest vote in the history of Texas, a record that they say won't be beaten unless I run again,\" Trump said.\nTRUMP CONFIRMS 2 NUCLEAR SUBMARINES ARE 'IN THE REGION' TO COUNTER RUSSIA\nCNBC anchorwoman Rebecca Quick interjected, \"Are you going to run again? The Constitution\u2026\"\n\"No, probably not,\" Trump responded. \"Probably not.\"\n\"And you're not going to, and you're not going to fire Jay Powell,\" Kernen added, referencing tensions between Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\nTrump circled back to address Quick directly: \"I'd like to run,\" Trump told the anchorwoman. \"I have the best poll numbers I've ever had. You know why. Because people love the tariffs, and they love the trade deals, and they love that countries \u2013 they love that foreign countries aren't ripping us off. For years, they ripped us. A friend, and foe and a friend. And the friends were worse.\"\nThe 22nd amendment of the U.S. Constitution says a person can be elected president only twice. If someone takes over as president \u2013 as a vice president would due to death or resignation \u2013 and serves more than two years in that term, the amendment states that person can only be elected president once more. It effectively sets a maximum of 10 years for any person to serve as commander-in-chief.\nTRUMP GOES AFTER SCHUMER: TELL HIM 'GO TO HELL'\nGeorge Washington set the tradition of stepping down as president after two terms, but the amendment came about in response to Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s unprecedented four terms. Roosevelt served during the Great Depression and World War II.\nTrump earlier this year both teased and distanced himself from the idea of a third term, as some conservative circles have floated changing the 22nd amendment to allow an exception for nonconsecutive presidencies.\nBefore Trump, the last and only other president to serve two nonconsecutive terms was Grover Cleveland in the late 1800s.\nIn May, Trump said he considered it a \"compliment\" that \"so many people\" wanted him to run in 2028 but said it was not something he was interested in pursuing.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I have never had requests so strong as that. But it's something to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do,\" Trump told MSNBC's Kristen Welker. \"There are many people selling the 2028 hat, but this is not something I'm looking to do. I'm looking to having four great years, and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican. A great Republican to carry it forward. But I think we're going to have four years, and four years is plenty of time to do something really spectacular.\"\nTrump said he believed the MAGA movement could survive without him, floating Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors."

In all fairness, he's the vice president, and I think Marco is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form,\" Trump replied.\n\"I also think we have incredible people, some of the people on the stage right here. So it's too early, obviously, to talk about it, but certainly he's doing a great job,\" he added. \"And he would be probably favored at this point.\"\nThe president also said others in his Cabinet could possibly lead the MAGA movement. Trump and some of his allies have previously floated the idea of him running for a third term, which is constitutionally prohibited.\nRubio ran against Trump during the 2016 primary but has since positioned himself as a Trump ally.\nLast month, Rubio dismissed speculation that he could be the Republican Party\u2019s 2028 presidential nominee. Instead, he threw support behind Vance.\n\"I think JD Vance would be a great nominee if he decides he wants to do that,\" Rubio said during an interview with Lara Trump that aired on the Fox News Channel.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHe also commended Vance\u2019s performance as vice president during the segment on \"My View with Lara Trump\" and made clear he is satisfied with his current role in President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet."

Rubio, previously a Republican senator representing Florida, was among the first confirmed to Trump's Cabinet.\n\"I believe that if I am able to be here, through the duration of this presidency, and we get things done at the pace that we've been doing the last six months, I'll be able to look back at my time in public service and say I made a difference, I had an impact, and I served my country in a very positive way,\" Rubio told Trump.\n\"And I would be satisfied with that as the apex of my career,\" he added."
