  "content": "Oh, what a show that was. A pan-Asia, pan-Eurasia, crossover Global South ball, with glittering dynamo Tianjin as backdrop, enjoyed as such by the overwhelming majority of the planet, while predictably generating cascades of sour grapes among the fragmented West \u2013 from the omnipotent Empire of Chaos to The Coalition of the Toothless Chihuahuas.\n\nHistory will register that as much as BRICS finally stepped into the limelight at the summit in Kazan in 2024, the SCO replicated the move at the summit in Tianjin in 2025.\n\nAmong a feast of highlights \u2013 hard to top Putin and Modi walking hand in hand \u2013 this was of course M.C. Xi\u2019s ball. The original RIC (Russia, India, China), as conceptualized by the Great Primakov in the late 1990s, were finally back in the game, together.\n\nBut it was Xi who personally set the main guidelines \u2013 proposing no less than a broad, new Global Governance model, complete with important ramifications such as a SCO development back, which should complement the BRICS\u2019s NDB, as well as close AI cooperation in contrast with Silicon Valley\u2019s techno-feudalism.\n\nGlobal Governance, the Chinese way, encompasses five core principles. The most crucial, no doubt, is sovereign equality. That connects with respect for the international rule of law \u2013 and not a shape-shifted, at will, \u201crules-based international order\u201d. Global Governance advances multilateralism. And also inevitably encourages a much-lauded \u201cpeople-centered\u201d approach, away from vested interests.\n\nPutin for his part detailed the role of the SCO as \u201ca vehicle for genuine multilateralism\u201d, in tune with this new Global Governance. And he crucially called for a pan-Eurasian security model. That\u2019s exactly the \u201cindivisibility of security\u201d that the Kremlin proposed to Washington in December 2021 \u2013 and was met by a non-response response.\n\nSo taken together, BRICS and SCO are totally engaged in burying the Cold War-era mentality, a world divided by blocs; and at the same time they are visionary enough to call for the UN system to be respected as it was originally conceived.\n\nNow that will be the Mother of Uphill Battles \u2013 including everything from taking the UN out of New York to completely revamping the Security Council.\n\nThe dance of Bear, Dragon and Elephant\n\nIf Xi set up the guidelines in Tianjin, the strategic guest of honor had to be Putin. And that extrapolated to their one-on-one meeting on Tuesday at the Zhongnanhai in Beijing: very private, as only special conversations are held at the former imperial palace. Xi greeted his \u201cold friend\u201d in Russian.\n\nAs Putin emphasized the central role of the SCO Development Program for the next 10 years, he was playing it very much the Chinese way, when it comes to all those successive, successful 5-year plans.\n\nThese roadmaps are essential to set long-term strategies. And in the case of the SCO, that means organizing its progressive shift from initially an anti-terrorism mechanism to a complex multilateral platform coodinating infrastructure development and geoeconomics.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where China\u2019s new idea \u2013 the establishment of the SCO Development Bank \u2013 comes in. It\u2019s a mirror institution to the NDB \u2013 the BRICS bank based in Shanghai, and parallel to the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the multilateral bank based in Beijing.\n\nOnce again, BRICS and SCO run intertwined, as their key focus is to progressively ditch dependence on Western paradigms and at the same time fight the effect of sanctions, which not by accident hit hard on the four top members of both BRICS and SCO: Russia, China, India and Iran.\n\nAnd of course, among all the camaraderie in Tianjin, there was Modi in China for the first time in 7 years. Xi went straight to the point: \u201cChina and India are great civilizations whose responsibilities extend beyond bilateral issues.\u201d And M.C. Xi once again hit the dancefloor: the future lies \u201cin the dance of the dragon and the elephant.\u201d Cue to the Three Eurasia amigos chatting amicably in the corridors.\n\nThe Tianjin Declaration \u2013 not as extensive as Kazan last year \u2013 still managed to emphasize the key points that apply to Eurasia: sovereignty, above anything else; non-interference in internal affairs of member-states; and total rejection of unilateral sanctions as tools of coercion.\n\nCrucially, that should apply not only to SCO member-states but to partners as well \u2013 from the Arab petromonarchies to the Southeast Asian powerhouses. Development strategies of different nations already cooperate, in practice, with BRI projects, from the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to the China-Belarus Industrial Park, extrapolating to cross-border e-commerce, AI and Big Data.\n\nThe SCO\u2019s astonishing geographic scale, combined with half of the world\u2019s population, carries tremendous potential across the spectrum \u2013 for instance on trade, transport infrastructure, cross-border investment and financial transactions. The potential is far from being realized.\n\nBut the high-speed trains are already rolling: geopolitical imperatives are guiding increased pan-Eurasia geoeconomic interaction.\n\nSo this is the top takeaway of the Tianjin Show: the SCO affirming itself as a solid strategic pole uniting a great deal of the Global Majority. And all that without the need to metastasize into an offensive military behemoth like NATO.\n\nIt\u2019s a long way from a pavillion in a Shanghai park in 2001, only three months before 9/11 \u2013 which was marketed by the Empire of Chaos as the foundation stone of the \u201cwar on terror\u201d. That other initially modest foundation stone \u2013 with Russia, China and three Central Asian \u201cstans\u201d \u2013 was the \u201cShanghai spirit\u201d: a set of principles based on mutual trust and benefit, equality, consultation, respect for the diversity of civilizations, and an emphasis on common economic development.\n\nHow the Shanghai spirit actually outlasted the \u201cwar on terror\u201d leaves us with much to ponder.\n\nIn his toast at the elegant banquet offered in Tianjin for SCO guests, Xi had to quote a proverb: \u201cIn a race of a hundred boats, those who row the hardest will lead\u201d.\n\nHard work. Results of which can be seen by anyone facing Tianjin\u2019s spectacular development. That has absolutely nothing to do with \u201cdemocracy\u201d \u2013 as debased by its allleged practitioners as it is across the collective West \u2013 opposed to \u201cthe autocrats\u201d, or \u201cvillains\u201d, or Axis of Upheaval, or any other stupidity. It\u2019s always about hard work \u2013 for the common good. That\u2019s what BRICS and SCO are fighting for.\n\nViews expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of ZeroHedge.",

The summit highlighted the launch of a SCO Development Bank to mirror the BRICS New Development Bank and the AIIB, aiming to reduce dependence on Western financial structures and counter sanctions. Leaders such as Putin and Modi underscored the role of the SCO as a vehicle for genuine multilateralism and a pan\u2011Eurasian security model, while China\u2019s initiatives seek to integrate infrastructure, AI, and trade across the Eurasian region. The event signals a shift toward a multipolar world order, challenging the existing Western\u2011led institutions and promoting deeper economic cooperation among the Global Majority.",
