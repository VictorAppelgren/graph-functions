  "description": "AC Milan\u2019s problems have carried over from last season. Defending Sereie A champion Napoli and 2023-24 winner Inter Milan confirmed themselves as the top contenders.",
  "content": "ROME (AP) \u2014 AC Milan\u2019s problems have carried over from last season. Defending Serie A champion Napoli and 2023-24 winner Inter Milan confirmed themselves as the top contenders. Como could challenge the top teams.\n\nThose were the verdicts from the opening round of Serie A.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know entering the second round of the Italian league:\n\nAfter losing at the San Siro to promoted Cremonese in its opener, Milan is under pressure to perform during a visit to Lecce on Friday. Returning coach Massimiliano Allegri has issues in attack with the Rossoneri so far unable to find a reliable solution at center forward amid potential deals on the transfer market that have fallen apart.\n\nWith Real Madrid product Nico Paz leading the way with a goal and an assist, Como comfortably beat Lazio in its opener. Now Como visits Bologna on Saturday to test itself against the Italian Cup champion. Coached by Cesc Fabregas, Como is owned by Indonesian tobacco billionaire brothers Roberto Budi Hartono and Michael Bambang Hartono and has spent 104 million euros ($121 million) in the current transfer market \u2014 the fifth most in the league.\n\nAlso on Saturday, Gian Piero Gasperini\u2019s Roma visits promoted Pisa, which will host a Serie A match for the first time in 34 years. The Arena Garibaldi sits practically in the shadow of the Leaning Tower of Pisa.\n\nJuventus has been trying to offload Dusan Vlahovic and his 12 million euros ($14 million) salary \u2014 the highest in the league \u2014 before his contract expires after this season. Without much success, though, since Vlahovic has turned down every offer. Vlahovic scored in Juve\u2019s opener, a 2-0 win over Parma, and if he puts in another solid performance at Genoa on Sunday, it could convince Juventus to keep him.\n\nInter struggled for alternatives in attack last season when Lautaro Martinez and Marcus Thuram were unavailable. Francesco Pio Esposito, a 20-year-old who could make his Serie A debut for Inter against Udinese on Sunday, is being touted as a future star. Esposito, who came up in Inter\u2019s youth program and scored 17 goals on loan with Spezia in Serie B last season, already scored for Inter against River Plate in the Club World Cup.\n\nCiro Immobile, the four-time Serie A scoring leader who signed with Bologna at age 35, is out for an estimated eight weeks after injuring his right leg last weekend.\n\nJuventus midfielder Andrea Cambiaso was banned for two matches for hitting a Parma opponent in the face.\n\nThe Serie A judge has requested more information before issuing a ruling over racist abuse directed at Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie by Parma fans.\n\nSerie A champion Napoli is shopping again in Manchester and appears close to signing Rasmus Hojlund from Manchester United to replace injured striker Romelu Lukaku.\n\nSerie A president Ezio Simonelli said he fears Italy could be stripped of the co-hosting rights with Turkey to the 2032 European Championship if an immediate move isn\u2019t made to update stadiums.",

The club, which is owned by Canadian Joey Saputo, has only won two second-division titles in between.\nIt was also coach Vincenzo Italiano\u2019s first win in a final, having lost back-to-back Europa Conference League title matches while in charge of Fiorentina and finishing runner-up in the 2023 Italian Cup.\n\u201cThey were three hefty disappointments,\u201d Italiano told broadcaster Mediaset. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could immediately come back and get my own back. But we succeeded and I\u2019m happy.\n\u201cI add an important trophy to my mantlepiece and I truly dedicate it to the guys, who were extraordinary.\u201d\nItaliano had been flung in the air by his players in celebration immediately after the final whistle. Many of them were in tears of joy, much like some of the thousands of Bologna fans in the stands.\nAnd the 47-year-old coach was eager to get back to the festivities.\n\u201cNow let me go and celebrate, because this is something really incredible,\u201d Italiano said with a smile at the end of his television interview.\nIt is Italiano\u2019s first season at Bologna after replacing Thiago Motta, who left to Juventus after steering the team to its first-ever Champions League qualification. Motta was fired by Juventus earlier this season.\nThe result secured Bologna a spot in next season\u2019s Europa League and left Milan with the very real likelihood of missing out on European competition.\nIt could spell the end of S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019s short stint in charge of the Rossoneri, with Milan eighth in Serie A after a disappointing season.\nBoth teams came to Rome looking to end an Italian Cup drought, as Milan last lifted the trophy 22 years ago \u2014 losing two finals in the intervening years.\nThe match was played at a high tempo from the start and both goalkeepers were called into making impressive saves in the opening 10 minutes.\nTension threatened to boil over toward the end of the first half and Bologna captain Lewis Ferguson was left bloodied with what looked like a broken nose after a sliding tackle on Rafael Le\u00e3o, who caught him on the face with his leg as he was upended.\nBologna broke the deadlock eight minutes into the second half. Riccardo Orsolini was tackled by Theo Hern\u00e1ndez in the area but the ball fell to Ndoye, who carved out some space before curling into the right side of the net.\nThe 24-year-old Switzerland international had missed Bologna\u2019s previous three matches with a thigh injury.\nMilan had fought back from a goal down to beat Bologna 3-1 in the Italian league on Friday, but there was to be no such comeback in Rome.\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"

      "text": "Italian soccer chief fears losing Euro 2032 hosting rights due to outdated stadiums\nItalian soccer chief fears losing Euro 2032 hosting rights due to outdated stadiums\nMILAN (AP) \u2014 A soccer chief in Italy says he fears the country could be stripped of the hosting rights to the European Championship in 2032 if an immediate move isn\u2019t made to update stadiums.\nItaly and Turkey will stage the tournament in seven years, but while Turkey has arenas and infrastructure almost entirely ready after a massive national construction project in the last two decades, Italy does not have 10 stadiums ready or in planning to host a 24-team, 51-game tournament.\nThe situation was called \u201ca shame\u201d by UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin in May, adding Italy had \u201cby far the worst infrastructure\u201d of the biggest nations in Europe.\nHis words set off alarm bells according to Ezio Simonelli, the president of the Italian league\u2019s governing body.\n\u201cI\u2019m really worried about Euro 2032,\u201d Simonelli said in an interview with Italian state radio.\n\u201cIs the candidacy at risk? I hope it\u2019s just my concern, but when the president of UEFA says that our stadiums are in a comatose state and the Euros are in six years\u2019 time, we risk not making a very good impression on an international level.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame, however, that, beyond Udine, Bergamo and Turin, the rest of our stadiums are in a comatose state. Ceferin has strongly criticized Italian stadiums and I agree with him.\u201d\nItaly needs to build and renovate an aging inventory of stadiums yet construction projects in the country, such as replacing the iconic San Siro in Milan and Stadio Olimpico in Rome, can be bureaucratic and slow.\n\u201cWe are behind all the other countries,\u201d Simonelli said. \u201cIn the last 18 years we have only inaugurated six stadiums, of which only three are in Serie A. In the rest of Europe, 226.\n\u201cI am very worried. We are pressing the government to streamline the procedure and thus silence the famous \u2018no committees,\u2019 which in Italy never get anything done, and the authorities that are supposed to protect cultural heritage.\u201d\nUdinese, Juventus and Atalanta are the only Serie A clubs to have new or recently renovated stadiums. They, crucially, own their grounds, while many arenas in Italy are council-owned.\nThe issue with San Siro highlights the problems clubs face. Inter Milan and AC Milan revealed plans to build a new stadium on the site in 2019 but delays and red tape made both clubs look for, and find, land to build new home venues in the city.\nHowever, in another complete turnaround, the clubs look set to buy the San Siro and land from the Milan city council after all. But even as this process moves forward slowly, there is still debate about the fate of the original San Siro.\nSan Siro was built in 1925 and has the largest capacity in Italy at 80,000. It will host the opening ceremony of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand what type of protection there should be for a stadium like San Siro,\u201d Simonelli said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hundred years old, it was rebuilt in 1955 and there is debate as to whether it was inaugurated before or after November. These are absurd things.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stadium that is no longer functional for playing soccer and welcoming people with dignity. You just need to go to the San Siro bathrooms to realize this. A new stadium needs to be rebuilt, full stop, putting an end to all these senseless diatribes.\u201d\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"

He\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d\nComparing it to his three Serie A titles won at Juventus and one at Inter Milan \u2014 not to mention a Premier League title at Chelsea \u2014 Conte said it was \u201cthe most unexpected, the most difficult, and the most stimulating in terms of the challenge.\u201d\nConte also noted how he had to try and convince players to stay when he arrived last June.\nNapoli needed only to do the same or better than defending champion Inter in the final round of matches, so Inter\u2019s 2-0 win at 10-man Como wasn\u2019t enough for the Nerazzurri.\nNapoli finished Serie A one point ahead of Inter.\nThe southern squad\u2019s fourth Serie A title overall capped an impressive turnaround after the Partenopei finished 10th during a dismal title defense last season.\n\u201cThe one two years ago was one we were (expecting) for months, whereas this week we had so much anxiety, we couldn\u2019t wait to get on the field and win this in front of our fans,\u201d said winger Matteo Politano, who provided the cross for McTominay\u2019s goal.\nDiego Maradona led Napoli to its first two titles in 1987 and 1990. The 2023 team led by Victor Osimhen and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia clinched with five rounds to spare.\nInter was heading toward the title until McTominay went airborne to redirect a pass from Politano in the 42nd minute for his 12th goal this season after transferring from Manchester United.\n\u201cFor me to come and experience this, it\u2019s a dream,\u201d McTominay said.\nLukaku, who was signed from Chelsea in August, controlled a long vertical pass and dribbled by two defenders before scoring in the 51st. It was his 14th goal along with his league-leading 10 assists.\nConte watched the match from the tribune after getting sent off last weekend. But he went down to the pitch at the final whistle and embraced Lukaku, with whom he also won Serie A at Inter in 2021.\nMcTominay dropped to the pitch in tears when the match finished. Minutes later he was honored as Serie A player of the season.\nNapoli players held up signs that read \u201cAgain\u201d featuring a \u201c4\u201d for the team\u2019s fourth title.\nNapoli fans began cheering and singing hours before kickoff at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona and erupted in celebration at the final whistle \u2014 including at jumbo screens that were set up in several of the city\u2019s central piazzas.\nCagliari was already sure of avoiding relegation but goalkeeper Alen Sherri was inspired at the start, denying Napoli on multiple occasions early on.\nWhile Napoli won by 16 points two years ago under Luciano Spalletti, this season was a duel with Inter virtually all season. It was also unexpected after Napoli went through three coaches last season \u2013 Rudi Garcia, Walter Mazzarri and Francesco Calzona.\nBut Conte constructed the best defense in Serie A, and brought in Lukaku and McTominay to play alongside holdovers from the 2023 team like captain Di Lorenzo, goalkeeper Alex Meret and midfielder Stanislav Lobotka.\nDi Lorenzo matched Maradona by captaining Napoli to two titles.\nIt also helped that Napoli did not play in Europe this season \u2014 keeping the team fresher for Serie A.\nInter rested its starters\nDefender Stefan de Vrij scored 20 minutes in for Inter, redirecting a corner kick with a bouncing header.\nComo was reduced to 10 men when goalkeeper Pepe Reina was sent off at the end of the first half for a foul on Mehdi Taremi. It was Reina\u2019s final game before retiring.\nJoaqu\u00edn Correa added another for Inter after the break in almost the same moment that Lukaku scored for Napoli.\nInter, which is also preparing for the Champions League final against Paris Saint-Germain in eight days, rested most of its usual starters, including top strikers Lautaro Martinez and Marcus Thuram.\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"

Plus former France and Real Madrid center back Raphael Varane, who then decided to retire but plans to remain with the club in another role.\nAlberto Moreno, a 32-year-old left back, has played every minute of the opening six Serie A matches after signing as a free agent in July after leaving Villarreal \u2014 having previously played for Liverpool.\nThen there\u2019s Nico Paz, a 20-year-old attacking midfielder signed from Real Madrid; and Alieu Fadera, 22-year-old Gambian winger signed from Genk.\nAdd in Como-born striker Patrick Cutrone (formerly of AC Milan), who is tied atop the league scoring chart with four goals in six games, and it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a mix of players not usually seen at a promoted club.\n\u201cComo is the revelation of the season,\u201d Napoli coach Antonio Conte said before the Serie A leader hosts Como on Friday.\nForeigners make up half of Como\u2019s fans\nIn Como\u2019s last three matches, it held Champions League side Bologna to 2-2, won at Champions League side Atalanta 3-2 and beat Hellas Verona 3-2 to move into the top half of the table in 10th.\n\u201cThe ambitions are high,\u201d Cutrone said. \u201cBut the first objective remains avoiding relegation. Then we\u2019ll see about the rest.\u201d\nThe club is collaborating with Lake Como Tourism to help attract more visitors to the area. Already 40% of Como\u2019s tickets are being purchased by foreigners.\n\u201cBut we also wanted to award our most devoted fans who have been season-ticket holders since Como was in Serie C,\u201d Suwarso said in Corriere della Sera. \u201cFor them, we haven\u2019t increased the ticket prices from last season.\u201d\nFabregas to meet one of his mentors in Conte\nVisiting the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona will be extra special for Fabregas, who will be facing one of his former coaches.\nFabregas played under Conte for two seasons at Chelsea. They won the English Premier League together the first year and the FA Cup the second season.\nBut before the trophies came, Conte told Fabregas when he arrived in London that he might want to think about finding another club because the coach didn\u2019t anticipate using him much.\n\u201cIt was the first time in my career, or maybe in my life, that someone had said something like that to me,\u201d Fabregas said this week, adding he took the message as motivation to work harder.\n\u201cAnd after four months I was playing all the time,\u201d Fabregas said. \u201cHe made me suffer in training. I learned a ton from him. It was a different method \u2014 a type of soccer I had never experienced before. Now I use his teachings when things get tough. He taught me a lot and I thank him for that.\u201d\nConte added, \u201cI always thought he could be a coach. He was curious and was always trying to learn.\u201d\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"

Gian Piero Gasperini\u2019s first match in charge of Roma ended in a 1-0 victory over Bologna.\nMcTominay joined Napoli from Manchester United last year in a move that was so successful he ended up being named Serie A player of the year.\nAnd the 28-year-old picked up where he left off last season by scoring Napoli\u2019s first goal of the new campaign in the 17th minute, peeling away from his marker to head Matteo Politano\u2019s cross from the right into the top near corner.\nMcTominay also sent a fierce effort crashing off the crossbar in first-half stoppage time, while Politano hit the post before Napoli doubled its lead in somewhat strange circumstances.\nDe Bruyne whipped in a free kick from wide on the left \u2014 practically on the touchline \u2014 and it went over everyone in the area before bouncing on the ground and going into the far bottom corner.\nThe 34-year-old De Bruyne, a two-time Premier League player of the season, joined Napoli in June on a free transfer after 10 years at Manchester City.\nSassuolo ended the match with 10 men after midfielder Isma\u00ebl Kon\u00e9 was sent off following a second yellow card, with 11 minutes remaining.\nSpectacular goal\nCremonese marked its return to the Italian top flight with a first ever victory over Milan at San Siro thanks to an early contender for goal of the season from Federico Bonazzoli.\nThe 28-year-old Bonazzoli, who started his career at Inter Milan, scored what was to prove the winner in the 61st minute with an acrobatic, overhead kick into the bottom corner.\nStrahinja Pavlovic had headed in the equalizer in first-half stoppage time to cancel out Federico Baschirotto\u2019s 28th-minute opener.\nAllegri, who left Milan in 2014, rejoined the Rossoneri at the end of May to replace the fired Sergio Conceicao.\nGasperini era begins\nWesley scored in his Serie A debut to give Gasperini a strong start to his Roma career.\nThe Brazil defender, who joined from Flamengo in July, brought down a long ball over the top and cut inside where he appeared to be intercepted by Jhon Lucum\u00ed but the Bologna defender only succeeded in prodding the ball back into the path of Wesley, who fired across into the bottom left corner.\nBologna lost both Ciro Immobile and Nicol\u00f3 Casale to injuries in the first half.\nElsewhere, Genoa drew 0-0 at home to Lecce.\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"
