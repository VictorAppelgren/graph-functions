  "content": "LA CROSSE, Wis., Aug. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- was surprised by his first Bassmaster Elite trophy, but not his second. The latter \u2014 this week's season-ending \u2014 fulfilled the Eleva, Wis., pro's honest expectation with a winning total of 66 pounds, 5 ounces.\n\n\"This one's so sweet, it means a lot to me,\" said Schlapper, who also won the in mid-May. \"The people that I get to fish with down here, it's for them. We put in a ton of work down here (prior to the off-limits period a month prior to the event) and it paid off.\n\n\"The Sabine was a kind of surprise to me, but this one I'm not surprised, because I fish down here so much and I have a ton of history. I'm so happy I won this (event). I love the Mississippi River and I hope we come back.\"\n\nIn a week marked with fluctuating water levels from heavy pre-tournament rains and strong winds the third and fourth days, Schlapper adjusted to the changing conditions and kept himself in the hunt.\n\nOn Day 1, he caught a fourth-place limit of 18-8. Adding a second-round bag that weighed 15-4, he rose to third. A limit of 14-2 kept him in third for Semifinal Saturday.\n\nConcluding with a Championship Sunday limit of 18-7, Schlapper recorded the heaviest winning weight in a Bassmaster Elite event at the Mississippi River. Californian won with 65-7 in .\n\nEdging fellow Wisconsin pro by 2-12, Schlapper took home the $101,000 top prize. The season finale also awarded an invitation to fish the , March 13-15 at the Tennessee River.\n\nBecause Schlapper qualified for the Classic through his 30th-place finish in the points, his invitation goes to rookie , the first angler outside the Classic cut.\n\nTapping into what he described as significant local knowledge, Schlapper followed a well-calculated daily game plan that involved locking up to Pool 7 and then returning to Pool 8, from which the tournament launched.\n\n\"I know Pool 7 better and I figured with the Classic qualification and a lot of things on the line, a lot of people wouldn't lock,\" he said. \"A lot of people get scared of (not making it back in time).\"\n\nIn Pool 7, Schlapper targeted vast expanses of eel grass, where he used a Big Bite Baits Jerk Minnow on a 5/0 round bend hook and a Spro Bronzeye Frog to search for schooling fish. In Pool 8, he punched dense vegetation in the Goose Pond area with a creature bait on a 4/0 hook with a 1 1/2-ounce weight.",

  "argos_summary": "Pat Schlapper captured his second Bassmaster Elite trophy at the season\u2011ending Mississippi River tournament, posting a winning bag of 66\u202fpounds, 5\u202founces and taking home a $101,000 prize.  The Wisconsin pro leveraged his local knowledge, targeting Pools\u202f7 and\u202f8 and using a mix of jerk minnows and creature baits to adapt to fluctuating water levels and wind.  His victory earned him an invitation to the 2026 Bassmaster Classic, while the Classic spot opened for rookie Tyler Smith after Schlapper\u2019s 30th\u2011place finish in points.  The event highlighted the high stakes of the Elite Series, where anglers compete for points toward the Angler of the Year title and Classic qualification.",
