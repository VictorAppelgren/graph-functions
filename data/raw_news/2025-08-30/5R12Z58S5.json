  "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nA classic economic indicator just nosedived to levels not seen since the depths of the 2020 pandemic, flashing bright-red signals about global growth fears.\n\nThe copper-to-gold ratio \u2014 a widely watched gauge of global economic sentiment \u2014 has plunged to 0.0015, its lowest reading since March 2020. This sharp decline suggests investors are losing confidence in the strength of the economic recovery.\n\nWhy Does The Copper-To-Gold Ratio Matter?\n\nThis ratio tracks how many pounds of copper you can get for one ounce of gold.\n\nCopper shines when the economy is expanding. It's used in everything from homes to electronics to infrastructure. Gold, on the other hand, thrives when investors seek safety \u2014 typically during economic downturns or geopolitical stress.\n\nTrending: Would you have invested in eBay or Uber early? The same backers are betting on this vacation home platform at just $2.90 per share.\n\nBecause copper is a bellwether for industrial activity and gold thrives in uncertain environments, a drop in the ratio often implies a loss of confidence in economic momentum.\n\nWhen the copper-to-gold ratio falls, it means that gold is outperforming copper \u2014 a clear \"risk-off\" signal. It tends to precede or coincide with major slowdowns.\n\nThe last time this ratio hit such low levels was in early 2020, right as COVID-19 threw the global economy into recession. Before that, such depressed readings were only seen during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nWhat Caused The Crash In Copper?\n\nAlthough copper has climbed 13% in the first half of 2025, volatility erupted quickly after President Donald Trump announced a 50% tariff on imported copper in July.\n\nPrices initially soared on fears of supply disruptions, hitting record highs. But on July 31, Trump clarified that refined copper would be exempt \u2014 sparking a jaw-dropping 22% collapse in a single day.\n\nThat was the worst single-day loss for copper ever, more than twice the biggest daily decline suffered during the Great Financial Crisis.\n\nBy late August, copper prices were still struggling to recover, holding at $4.52 per pound \u2014 a level that reflects ongoing uncertainty around trade policy and industrial demand.\n\nSee Also: Wealth Managers Charge 1% or More in AUM Fees \u2014 Range's AI Platform Does It All for a Flat Fee (and Could Save You $10,000+ Annually).
