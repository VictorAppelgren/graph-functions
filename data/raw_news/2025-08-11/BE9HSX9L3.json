  "title": "TDK backs Ultraviolette with $21M to take India-made electric motorcycles global",
  "description": "Ultraviolette aims to expand its electric motorcycles to 40 European countries, as well as Latin America and Southeast Asia.",
  "content": "Two months ago, Indian electric motorcycle startup Ultraviolette expanded into 10 European countries. Now, fueled with $21 million in an all-equity round led by the corporate venture arm of Japanese electronics giant TDK Corporation, Ultraviolette is putting its expansion plans into overdrive.\n\nThe nine-year-old startup plans to grow its European footprint fourfold, enter other motorcycle-driven markets such as Latin America and Southeast Asia, and increase its portfolio to 14 models by early 2027. Ultraviolette\u2019s global expansion follows the 2024 launch of its F77 Mach 2 flagship model and its second product, the F77 SuperStreet, in February.\n\nBehind Ultraviolette are two childhood friends \u2014 CEO Narayan Subramaniam and CTO Niraj Rajmohan \u2014 who combined their expertise in mechanical engineering, automotive design, computer science, and electronics to electrify the mid-segment two-wheeler market.\n\nThe duo, which drew inspiration from Tesla, started Ultraviolette at a time when India\u2019s electric two-wheeler market was dominated by low-speed models, mainly catering to commercial and utility needs. The early boom was driven by Chinese imports offering low-cost options, followed by a wave of homegrown startups and, more recently, legacy manufacturers entering the space.\n\nInstead of becoming just another player in that race, the Ultraviolette co-founders set out to build electric motorcycles that could match the performance of 150cc to 800cc internal combustion engine sports bikes.\n\n\u201cWe asked ourselves, if we have to make electric exciting in two-wheelers, what would it take? And that\u2019s the objective with which we started,\u201d said Rajmohan (pictured above, right) in an exclusive interview.\n\nThe Bengaluru-based startup took about four years from its inception in 2016 to unveil the first model in 2019. The startup went through multiple design iterations before finalizing the seventh version \u2014 hence the name F77. The commercial version debuted with a fixed battery pack to deliver over 186 miles of range and a top speed of 96 miles/hour with a 30kW peak power and up to 100 newton-meters of torque.\n\nUltraviolette has also unveiled the lightweight Shock Wave motorcycle as well as the Tesseract scooter, which features front and rear radars and cameras to enable an assisted-driving experience and blindspot detection. The scooter costs \u20b9120,000 ($1,370), while its motorcycles (ex-showroom) have a base price of \u20b9175,000 ($2,000) and goes up to $10,000.\n\nUltraviolette\u2019s vehicles come equipped with eSIM connectivity and feature predictive maintenance powered by a proprietary diagnostics system. Rajmohan said the system can detect even minor issues, such as when the chain needs lubrication. The startup offers an app that provides all these insights to consumers on the go.\n\nThe company has also established a manufacturing and assembly facility in Bengaluru\u2019s Electronics City, with a capacity of 30,000 units. Today, the company handles everything in-house from developing embedded software and battery management systems to motor controllers and even battery manufacturing. About 500 people work at Ultraviolette, including 200 in corporate functions and R&D.\n\nUltraviolette\u2019s business model was shaped in part by Tesla owners. The co-founders spent time talking to Tesla owners in the U.S., who were among the first ones to buy the Model S in 2015, to learn what made the that car different from other EVs of its time.\n\n\u201cThese Tesla cars were very special, as owning them was seen as progressive. It was more of a lifestyle statement,\u201d Rajmohan told TechCrunch.\n\nThe co-founders brought that sentiment to Ultraviolette\u2019s design and branding, aiming to make it a global company from day one. As Rajmohan explained, the word \u201cviolet\u201d is pronounced similarly in over 30 European languages, while \u201cultra\u201d signals something cutting-edge. Reinforcing that ambition, the startup pursued European certification for all its vehicles even before entering the market.\n\nThis is unlike other Indian electric two-wheeler manufacturers, which have tried to cater to local demand. India accounts for nearly 40% of global motorcycle sales \u2014 although most of those are powered by internal combustion engines.\n\nExpanding beyond India makes strategic sense for Ultraviolette, given the domestic EV market remains relatively underpenetrated \u2014 with adoption at just 7.66%, compared to the global average of 16.48%, according to a recent report by government-backed think tank NITI Aayog. While India aims to reach 30% EV penetration by 2030, progress so far suggests that it may be an ambitious target.\n\nIndia is also a price-sensitive market, where two-wheelers are typically not discretionary purchases, but essential and affordable modes of daily transportation. As a result, selling high-end variants at scale in the country could be a challenge for Ultraviolette \u2014 at least initially.\n\n\u201cWe were very clear that what we\u2019re doing is, we\u2019re working toward segments which are more universal in nature,\u201d Rajmohan said.\n\nUltraviolette plans to expand the capacity of its Bengaluru production facility to up to 60,000 units and add a larger location to scale to about 300,000 units by early next year. Ultraviolette operates 20 stores across 20 Indian cities and plans to grow to around 100 by March next year. About 50 of those stores \u2014 one per city \u2014 are expected to open by the festive season later this year.\n\nRajmohan told TechCrunch the startup is working on expanding its European presence, where it has 40 dealers.\n\n\u201cNext year is where the scale-up happens in Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nThe startup also plans to start its pilot in Latin America and Southeast Asia next year and go to markets including the U.S. and Japan later.\n\nUltraviolette has sold more than 3,000 motorcycles in India and has projected to sell up to 10,000 later this year. It has also targeted over $50 million in revenue by the end of this financial year. To date, it has raised around $75 million in funding and counts Qualcomm Ventures, Exor, and TVS Motor among its other key investors.",

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.

      "text": "India is the largest motorcycle market in the world, with around 40% of the total volume. The Indian motorcycle industry has experienced remarkable growth and transformation over the years, propelling the country to become a key player in the global motorcycle landscape. From the explosion of motorcycles in India itself to the international exposure gained by iconic brands like Royal Enfield and more recently Hero MotoCorp, and the establishment of production facilities by multinational companies, India has emerged as a significant force in the motorcycle industry. In this article, we look at the journey of how India became a prominent player in the motorcycle world.\nThe Motorcycle Boom In India\nIndia's love affair with motorcycles began in the early 1950s when the government encouraged the establishment of indigenous manufacturing soon after the country gained independence. This led to the emergence of several Indian motorcycle manufacturers, catering to the growing demand of a rapidly expanding population. Motorcycles offered an affordable and practical transportation solution for millions of people in a country with limited infrastructure. They were a better alternative to the more expensive four-wheelers in a price-sensitive market. As a result, the motorcycle market in India experienced an explosion, with bikes becoming a symbol of freedom and mobility.\nThe Rise Of Royal Enfield\nIt so happened that motorcycles first surfaced in India in 1955, when the government needed two-wheelers that could withstand harsh terrain and be used by the Indian Army and police in the country's western regions. The first batch of motorbikes produced in India was the 350 cc \"Bullet\" by the British company Royal Enfield. It was in Chennai where these motorcycles were first assembled. The initial units of motorcycles were assembled from components imported from England. In 1957, Royal Enfield acquired the necessary machines to manufacture complete units in India, and by 1962 all of Enfield's motorcycles were made in India.\nToday, Royal Enfield is perhaps one of the foremost brands that played a significant role in putting India on the global motorcycle map. With its rich heritage and classic designs, Royal Enfield motorcycles captured the imagination of riders worldwide. Known for their ruggedness and vintage charm, their bikes gained international recognition and appeal. This exposure not only boosted the brand's reputation but also shone a spotlight on India's motorcycle manufacturing capabilities. From the earlier Classic 350 to the now widely popular Interceptor 650 twin, Enfield has come a long way. Their upcoming motorcycle catalogue only makes things even more exciting for those that crave the vintage, retro charm in their hearts.\nIndia Becomes A Production Hub\nBy the 90s, the Indian motorcycle landscape had changed much. Three seasoned Indian business giants \u2014 Hero, Bajaj, and TVS had all partnered with three well-known Japanese companies \u2014 Honda, Kawasaki, and Suzuki, respectively, and procured technology from each of them. This was instrumental to drive motorcycle sales in India from 759,000 units in 1983 to 4.1 million units in 2001.\nThe success of Indian motorcycle manufacturers and the country's booming domestic market caught the attention of multinational companies. They recognized the immense potential and advantages of establishing production facilities in India. These companies, including renowned names like KTM, Yamaha, Honda, and Triumph, saw the advantages of utilizing India's skilled labor, cost-effectiveness, and vast market potential. For instance, KTM collaborated with Bajaj Auto, an Indian two-wheeler giant, to set up production facilities in India. This partnership allowed KTM to leverage Bajaj's expertise in manufacturing and distribution while benefiting from India's cost-effective production capabilities. The collaboration resulted in the production of KTM motorcycles in India, which not only catered to the domestic market but also became an export hub for KTM motorcycles worldwide.\nIndia's Growing Influence In The Motorcycle Industry\nIndia's emergence as a key player in the motorcycle industry extends beyond just its manufacturing prowess. The country has become a hub for innovation, research, and development, with manufacturers investing in technology and designing bikes. For instance, several Indian companies have been at the forefront of electric motorcycle development. One notable example is the recent startup Revolt Motors, which introduced India's first AI-enabled electric motorcycle. This exemplifies the country\u2019s commitment to a sustainable shift towards electric mobility.\nAs for their global presence, Indian motorcycle companies are expanding their international footprint by exporting their bikes to various countries. Apart from Royal Enfield, Bajaj, Hero, and TVS, all are prominent players that have established a strong presence in international markets. They have not only demonstrated the quality and competitiveness of Indian motorcycles but have also showcased the country's manufacturing capabilities and engineering expertise on a global scale.\nIndia's rise as a key player in the motorcycle industry is not only attributed to its vast domestic market but also to the industry's ability to adapt to changing trends, embrace technology, and produce bikes that cater to a wide range of consumer needs. With a mix of indigenous brands, international collaborations, and multinational production facilities, India's presence in the motorcycle industry is set to grow stronger in the years to come."
