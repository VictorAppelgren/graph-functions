  "title": "When Apparel Is Resistance: The Historic Style Of Movements For Change",
  "description": "Our clothing is an outward expression of cultural identity, and it can bring people together and still push groups apart.",
  "content": "\u201cSometimes the clothing manifests the ideology,\u201d my friend Josh Johnson said to me. We were sitting in a law firm conference room in what was once a Studebaker dealership, a beautiful historic building owned by my friend Bob Cox, who gave us the space to have a complicated conversation.\n\nI had been wanting to explore some rather complex ideas related to the tense political situation we are all living through right now. Johnson is an education and activist, and as long as I have known him he has been working to improve our community. His tireless efforts include work with our local public radio station, WFSU, and he\u2019d interviewed me earlier this year for his show The Warehouse, a series of weekly conversations with people in our area working in the arts.\n\nJohnson teaches high school and college courses and he\u2019s the CEO of 621 Gallery, a nonprofit arts programming and exhibition space that is something close to the last bastion of an arts center in Florida\u2019s mostly arts-free capital. Very seriously, our city leadership has almost no interest in saving our tiny arts district, which was decimated by tornados last year. It\u2019s a part of town right near Florida Agricultural & Mining University, one of our nation's many exceptional Historically Black Colleges and Universities. So please know, when I say we don\u2019t have a performing arts venue or city art museum, I am not being hyperbolic. But that is a different conversation.\n\nI asked my friend to have a conversation about what apparel means to resistance, because regardless of political persuasion, I believe that we dress in a manner that reflects our beliefs. Everyone is divided right now, it feels important to examine why and how, the nuances seem particularly important.\n\nI started with a hard question. I asked him about the extremes we see in images of ICE agents and the communities they are arresting, the way their unofficial store bought face coverings impact the way we see them, the way that regardless of opinion about the need for what they are doing, the look of the ICE agent almost instantly became ubiquitous in American culture.\n\n\u201cThe famous picture in the 1960s,\u201d Johnson continued, \u201cof the young man who was a part of the flower we power movement sticking the flowers into the barrels of guns. The soldiers juxtaposed against him did highlight who was who and which sides were which.\u201d\n\nIn the protest photograph the distinctions are clear, and perhaps that explains part of why the image remains powerful after so many decades; it is clear who is good and who is bad. This sort of simplicity, the absolutes of black and white, are rarely reflections of the real world. There probably isn\u2019t anything in existence that doesn\u2019t exist in grey scale, and when we are making decisions about who is who, thinking in degrees makes everything exponentially complicated.\n\nThis was not always the case. Without judgement about whether the casual nature of clothing worn to protests today is a good thing or a bad thing, it is objectively true that the clothing worn to protest, historically, was a much more formal affair.\n\n\u201cA lot of the time,\u201d Johnson said, \u201c activists are dressed exactly like their opponents. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who had a deep problem with Bull Connor in the 1960s, you can't find very much difference in the way that those two men were dressed. They're both in suits of their time, ties of their time, shirts of their time, shoes, whatever. Sometimes that juxtaposition gives weight to the activism. I do not think that those points are either mutually exclusive or are necessary because sometimes it just happens how it happens.\u201d\n\nI have been feeling like when I watch or read the news, increasingly there seem to be examples of cultural identity in dress, and through a media lens, it is hard not to worry that those divisive visuals are being exploited for attention. There is a lot of money involved in Americans hating or fearing communities that look different than their own.\n\n\u201cIt's a Cultural tribalism,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cCultural Tribalism is something that either separates people within a culture or groups people together to show the distinctions of culture. Many times, this is a helpful thing or a point of pride for cultures. The poncho and the sombrero is something that an authentic indigenous Mexican man or woman is proud of. The dashiki is something that an indigenous Ghanaian is proud of.\u201d\n\nWhile preparing for our conversation, I\u2019d found Daisy Maldonado\u2019s article in Vogue about young Mexican Americans using traditional dress as a form of resistance. I asked Johnson what he thought about this, and like the educator he is, his answer was an analogy.\n\n\u201cAs a journalist,\u201d Johnson told me, \"I had the grand pleasure at the beginning of this year to interview Roy Wood, Jr. And in one of his routines he says these very overtly political things that are wrapped up in comedy. He goes off in a very real moment and says, and I'm paraphrasing here, that sometimes it is incumbent on us to fall back and believe what people are saying. That their experience is really happening and us not having to critique that experience as being right or wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a man and not as a journalist,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI believe that a return to culture is always a healthy thing for an individual. Not only does it secure that individual's knowledge of themselves, it also exposes other people to a way of life that is just simply beautiful, no matter who you are. Culture cannot inherently be bad when we're talking about people. Now, there are obviously visceral and terrible things about all cultures, all cultures come with good and bad, but culture cannot be inherently bad. I think a return to cultural garb can only signify a good thing. As a non-political statement, America is an experiment based on the idea that cultures will come together. So, anything that's the antithesis of that seems anti-American.\u201d\n\nI asked Johnson if he felt like, in any way, there was a look specific to activism. And while my question was clumsy he understood the root of it and that was the question my friend answered.\n\n\u201cThe uniform of activism is something that has been talked about and debated,\u201d Johnson told me, \u201cyou really have to boil it down to the fact that an activist doesn't look any specific way. However, we would be glib to think that whether it's Chairman Fred Hampton from the Black Panther Party, or whether it's some foreign dictator, that counter-cultural apparel adds to the seriousness of an activist.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to deal with the hyper awareness I\u2019ve noticed in myself when I encounter someone wearing a red hat in public. I want to understand that response.\n\n\u201cWhether we like them, love them, hate them, despise them, their existence is an organic representation of populism,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSometimes populism is the type of populism we like. Sometimes it's the type we don't like. That's the nature of populism. What populism is always going to do is give us very organic things of that movement. Going back to the hats, it wouldn't be possible to organize and facilitate anything counter because it wouldn't be organic. Some people might want a counter uniform, that can only happen if another movement arises in response and comes equipped. But that's the beauty of populism. You can't manufacture it. Now, don't get me wrong, you can do things to co-opt it. But the feelings and the sentiments and the loyalties that will allow people to want to wear something has to be natural and organic. It has to come from a place of either deep passion, deep feelings, or deep aggrievement.\u201d\n\nAll of the public discourse right now does feel emotionally driven, and to some extent that is rational. It makes sense that we would have strong feelings about the state of the world. The world is scary and the general state of the planet feels a lot less stable than it did not long ago.\n\nJohnson still remembers his debate team coach, Ms. Sears, and the music she would play on team road trips. Johnson credits his coach and the experience with opening his ear to music he might not have otherwise discovered. Teachers like Ms. Sears inspire their students to grow up and find vocations instead of careers. Mentors are vital to anyone seriously interested in learning, to people growing or developing anything. But the relationship is good for the mentors too, I don\u2019t think we talk about that enough, how mentoring is symbiotic by nature. How mentoring is a closed loop system that teaches self-regulation.\n\n\u201cJoining that debate team was the start of my life,\u201d he said to me. \u201cIt was my baptism. It was an outward expression of an inward change.\u201d\n\nOne of the many great things about America and American culture is how we, most of us anyway, allow teenagers to try on identities during this developmental stage. It's simple to divide kids up by cafeteria tables in content for a screen, but in the real world, students are much more empathetic and sensitive to the needs of others than they were when Josh and I were students.\n\nI asked him about his work as an educator and how he saw his students reacting to all the forces he and I were discussing. Josh and I are both millennials, but all generations get castigated for their perceived faults as they near their majority. I was curious about their response; of course it was related to music.\n\n\u201cI teach college level kids and I teach older high school level kids,\u201d Johnson told me, \u201cthe high school seniors in dual enrollment classes. The time when people start to begin figuring themselves out.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are trying on their identities to see what fits and to find out what feels comfortable for them,\u201d he said. I love this quote, \u2018a good educator shows you others. A great educator shows you yourself or brings you back to yourself.\u2019 So, if somebody walks in my classroom, no matter which classroom it is, wearing the t-shirt of a band, whether it's Nirvana, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, S.L.Y and THE FAMILY STONE, the Eagles, whatever, there's a resurgence in the band t-shirt. The music shirt stamps a person as cool, because it makes you look like you\u2019ve got this seasoned taste that you maybe shouldn't have. It propels you into the zeitgeist as being one of the cool kids. I want to turn that on its head. I'll say, I'll give you extra credit if you can name two or more songs from the band that you have on your shirt. A hundred percent of the time, they can't name one song.\u201d\n\nThis surprised me a little, but probably because I own far too many obscure tees that I wear in hope of someone appreciating the niche interest. An entirely different sort of conversation than my friend was describing. Was it about the graphics from the album covers or tours?\n\n\u201cThey like the idea of people thinking that they like Nirvana, because Nirvana is cool,\u201d Josh said with a smile. \u201cBut when they can't name a song, two things happen there. First thing is they don't get the extra credit. The second thing is, now they live in a world where they're aware that people might converse with you about who you think you are or the identity that you're trying on. So if you're smart, you'll learn a little of the context of what comes with the uniform, not just put on the uniform. If you're going to wear a S.L.Y and THE FAMILY STONE shirt, maybe you ought to listen to If You Want Me to Stay or Family Affair, so that at least you don't make a fool of yourself and have to prove the identity that you're trying on.\u201d\n\nThe last question I asked my friend was enormous, but after such heavy contemplation, I wanted to be certain that we both left ready to return to our respective work. So I asked him what he felt was worth working for, above and beyond all else. He grinned before he answered me.\n\n\u201cThe cheap answer,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cwhich I don\u2019t want to give you, is everything.\u201d Josh and I first became friends when we bonded over a mutual desire to find ways to help our community be better for more members of our community. So I smiled right back at him and gave him the space to complete his thoughts.\n\n\u201cAccess has always been the most important thing in all of my work,\u201d Johnson told me, \u201ceducation, activism, politics, art and culture... To me it has been nothing but a pursuit of challenging the notion that some people should and some people shouldn't, or vice versa. That doesn't matter, I think everybody should have the same access. I do believe that access is the greatest education because it's oftentimes exposure.\u201d",

      "text": "CRA narrowly votes to support local effort to save Railroad Square amid drama\nTemperatures rose Thursday as the Tallahassee Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) Board voted to work with a group called the Railroad Square Revitalization Cohort towards collaborative local ownership of Railroad Square to preserve the beleaguered arts district.\nThe final vote was an unusual 3-2 split: Curtis Richardson was the rare swing vote and joined Commissioners Jack Porter and Jeremy Matlow in supporting the move while Mayor John Dailey and Commissioner Dianne Williams-Cox voted against.\nRichardson explained, however, that his support was conditional.\n\"We made a promise to several predominantly African American neighborhoods in this city that we would invest in the redevelopment and revitalization of those neighborhoods,\" Richardson said. \"I'm okay with (working with the cohort) but the bottom line is that anything that would preclude us from fulfilling our promise to those neighborhoods ... I would not be interested in.\"\nAlongside verbal jabs among the board, Railroad Square co-owner Adam Kaye made a last minute appearance, after which he was almost escorted out of City Hall. A mystery offer to buy the entire property at the appraised amount of $6.4 million was also emailed to commissioners by a local realty firm.\nAccording to CRA staff, Adam Kaye and sister Lily Kaye said they wouldn't entertain it as the offer was too low.\nThursday's meeting was the latest development in the months-long saga to determine the future of Railroad Square, which endured a heavy hit from the May 10 tornado outbreak and led the Kayes to issue something of an ultimatum to elected leaders: Buy the property or they'd open it up to private developers.\nNow the Railroad Square Revitalization Cohort, comprised of 621 Gallery, Mickee Faust club and the Council on Culture and Arts (COCA), look ahead. Their next two weeks are booked with meetings with public and private developers, as yet unidentified, and locals who could aid in their cause.\nKaye family shoots offer dead in water\nStephen Cox, the executive director of the CRA, read an email \u2212 which the board received the night before \u2212 from the Big Bend Group, a real estate concern, who had sent an offer to the Kayes for $6.4 million, the appraised value of the whole property.\nThe email, sent by the Big Bend Group's Bruce Foster, said that he was representing a group of investors but did not name them.\nHe did say, however, that the investors \"envision redeveloping Railroad Square into a well-funded, world-class arts destination, transforming it into a key community asset for Tallahassee residents and visitors. Their plan includes the addition of apartments, commercial buildings, art galleries and public spaces.\"\n\"Once the contract is signed, my clients would like to engage with the CRA and other local government entities to explore opportunities for collaboration with tenants and community stake holders,\" Foster wrote in his email. \"The goal is to ensure that the proposed vision for the property aligns with broader community objectives and addresses any concerns.\"\nCox went on to say he received an email from Lily Kaye in which she believes the \"appraisal undervalued Railroad Square\" and that a buyer would be willing to pay the \"highest and best value\" of around $10 million.\nDailey shook his head at that: \"I'm a little disappointed that Mr. and Ms. Kaye are not here ... Mr. Kaye has not attended a single one of the public meetings while asking for over $10 million from this body.\"\nHe added: \"I was excited to see the offer that came through last night ... I will wait to hear more from Mr. and Ms. Kaye on exactly why they will not entertain this offer because if it comes down to money I think they're showing their true colors.\"\nAs the board discussed between themselves how to move forward with Railroad Square, Adam Kaye burst into the chamber and announced his presence. He sat in the front row of the city commission chambers.\nThroughout the later discussion, board members continued to talk about Kaye as if he was not there, causing him to speak up and attempt to answer questions, but he was told he was \"out of order.\" This continued as he threw his arms in the air and continued shouting out.\nAfter voting, Williams-Cox had some words for Railroad Square tenants: \"It is unfortunate that you had to put your paint brushes down, your scripts down, to come down here repeatedly to try to save a district that is owned by someone who refused an offer to do that.\"\nKaye then blurted out, \"Leave me out of your politics, lady.\" She called for security but Kaye left before they showed up. Outside the chambers, security kept a close eye on him watching to make sure he left City Hall.\nKaye later said his family would be putting out a statement on the topic of the politicization of their sale of Railroad Square. As of late Thursday, it had not been received.\nThis story contains previously published material. Arianna Otero is the trending and breaking news reporter for the Tallahassee Democrat.

      "text": "Dressed to Kill, the third episode of Season Two of PBS\u2019s Human Footprint, explores apparel and its impact on our planet. Literally. Because the ways that we make what we wear, the practices, habits and infrastructure, it can alter the land that we live on. Earlier this week I met with Dr. Nate Dappen and Dr. Neil Losin, directors and producers of the docuseries, to talk about this fascinating episode.\nDr. Losin and Dr. Dappen were quick to tell me that they\u2019re not really fashion people, but it wasn\u2019t defensive, they were showing me how they found an entry point into apparel.\n\u201cI learned a ton about fashion,\u201d Dr. Dappen said when I asked about the personal effect of making this episode. \u201cI don't think I'd ever really thought about it quite as deeply as this episode forced us to think about it. It became clear working on this, not only that we're a species that has spent time and effort and energy and resources into crafting materials that clothe our bodies, but clothing really is the thing that's allowed us to take over the whole planet, it's allowed us to move everywhere. That practical side is great, but I think the other side, about fitting into groups, is so critical. Maybe I didn't appreciate it as much until I read Virginia Postrial's book, The Fabric of Civilization. In some ways fitting in feels almost like a dirty word, but I think I have a much deeper appreciation for how important it is, and I came to realize how critical of a role that form is to function in our groups and in society and in this complicated world we live in.\u201d\n\u201cFor my part,\u201d Dr. Losin told me, \u201cI think historically I felt like the person who dresses functionally and I didn't care what people thought, like that. I think I've realized as I've gotten older, and maybe a little more introspective, that even in the social circles that Nate and I travel in, in our jobs, we're science and wildlife documentarians. You walk around a film festival or an industry event and it might not be high fashion. But there are still the social signifiers in the way that people are dressed, right? It's the North Face jacket and it's the Arc'teryx slacks, or some certain shoes, something like that. And yes, those things are very functional, but I think it's fascinating the way that function has been co-opted into a social signifier and a fashion statement as well.\u201d\nAt its essence, fashion, both what we wear and how it is made, how all of that affects everything else in our world, it\u2019s a fascinating intersection of science and culture. Fashion needs to make changes to its industry practices, for the good of all, we need to remove petroleum from clothing. Messaging that audiences will hear is vital to making progress, and this series is an excellent example of how things could be done. It\u2019s pretty impressive work from (relatively) new filmmakers.\u201cThis is the first hosted show that we've made,\u201d Dr. Losin told me. \u201cWe were all new to this to some degree when we started,\u201d We met Shane back when he was a grad student studying lizards at Harvard.\u201d\nIt turns out that all three of them began their careers in herpetology. \u201cWe bonded over that,\u201d said Dr. Losin, \u201cand the first time we filmed Shane, we filmed him for a film about lizards.\u201d\nA few years later they worked together again on a science communication workshop and when they were finished Dr. Campbell-Staton told Dr. Losin and Dr. Dappen about an idea he had been playing with, how neat it would be to create a docuseries about evolution that is driven by people.\nAt this point, Dr. Losin told me, \u201cShane had done a little bit of on-camera work, but nothing where he was the main character, the host. We learned together and we learned to trust Shane's instincts and he learned to trust our instincts. Nate and I had actually already begun developing a similar concept on our own that we hadn't really started pitching to broadcasters yet. And Shane said, \u2018I think I should be the host.\u2019 And we looked at him, we had interacted with Shane maybe a handful of times at that point, and we both thought he really would be a good host. PBS was really excited about the concept and gave us the opportunity to actually give this a shot.\u201d\nThat was that. Roughly a million hours of work later, and Human Footprint was born.\n\u201cMaking a show like this,\u201d Dr. Losin told me, \u201cit has to affect you in some way. Hopefully it affects the audience in a similar way and gets people to think a little bit harder. About the choices they make and some of the hidden costs that go along with that, the externalities that aren't priced into the sticker price, whether that's a $5 t-shirt or it's a $3 hamburger. We're not paying for the environmental costs or the climate change costs of the production of that beef. These kinds of choices are all over our lives, where either our social structures, our institutions make the costs invisible or whether, in some cases, there are literal subsidies to industries that artificially decrease the prices of things. I think it's always worth investigating, interrogating the choices we make and trying to get why this thing that seems like it ought to be expensive is really cheap? Usually there's a scary answer at the end of that tunnel.\u201d\nThe most cursory online search into the impact that the textile industries in Southeast Asia have had on the waterways in that part of the world will prove to you how very right he is.\n\u201cI don't have any empirical evidence to support this,\u201d Dr. Dappen said, \u201cbut I feel deeply, after working on this episode and so many other episodes of Human Footprint, that the big thing we're lacking in our lives is connections to the people that make the things that make our life good. The systems that we operate in now make that so difficult. The people who make our clothes are on the other side of the planet now.\u201d\nI asked if the guys if making the episode had convinced them to talk more about clothing, if it changed the way they communicate about what we wear with the people in their lives.\n\u201cA lot of the conversations I have with my family and with my friends now revolve around, how can I have less that is more valuable,\u201d Dr. Dappen told me. \u201cIt does seem like there is an obsession with individual expression, but the value in that individual expression, I think it doesn't align with folks' true values. I think most people want the world to be a good place. They want the world to be more sustainable, but through a lot of the choices we make, they betray them. That's a core thing that I've been taking away. I don't mean to put the blame on customers because we're in a system now where the consequences of our choices are totally obscured by the system. We don't even know how bad of a choice we're making or what it's doing to somebody or someplace on the other side of the world.\u201d\nDr. Losin agreed. \u201cI think we in the developed world are incredibly insulated from the consequences of our consumer choices. I think we're pretty immersed in this world of conservation and wildlife and sustainability. I had certainly heard of these clothing graveyards in Chile, for example, but had not seen them, had never filmed them and I really didn't understand the full scope of what was happening there. We are rarely doing true investigative reporting. You can't really do that on a documentary timeline, on a documentary budget, at least not for broadcast television. Some people work on investigative docs that take many, many years to make. We're not doing that, but we are able to find the people who are doing that investigative work.\u201d\nIn this instance, talking to John Bartlett, a National Geographic journalist based in Santiago, Chile, really helped cement the vision for this episode of the show.\n\u201cSpending time on the ground with John in Iquique,\u201d Dr. Losin told me, \u201cwhich is something that Nate did basically solo, it all came together on very short notice. We happened to be in Princeton filming with Shane for something else and then there was this opportunity to get a camera person down to Iquique and meet up with John. And we were like, we\u2019ve got to do this. It all came together fast. Being able to tap into the people who are actually on the ground doing that investigative reporting is something that we really like to do. It's why we feature so many journalists in the show, because we recognize that we're not the ones actually doing the discovering. But by tapping into those who are unraveling these systems, those supply chains and everything else, we can bring the audience to a place of learning something new and hearing it directly from the people who really found that out.\u201d\n\u201cWhat we tried to do,\u201d Dr. Dappen added, \u201cis piece together disparate aspects of this story in a way that have never been put together. Leading people from the creation of a fiber through the devastation of an ecosystem, through the creation of hats into Fashion Week and then showing how that all connects to what's happening today with fashion waste and issues of sustainability. I think that is one of the things that the show does well, I think we put together the story in a way that is unique.\u201d\nThe story is important, telling it is the reason for this work, but the people making this series are very conscious of the experience the audience will have. This is not a heavy handed lecture and you will not be made to feel like a terrible person at any point in time while watching. After speaking with the filmmakers, I suspect that they would see very little utility in that approach.\n\u201cWe put a huge amount of effort into doing everything we can not to create any villains,\u201d Dr. Dappen told me. \u201cBecause, I would say, with very few exceptions, there are no real bad guys and good guys in this world. It's just most people trying to fit into their groups and make a life for themselves that is reasonable. And that is by design in our show. We definitely don't want to point fingers or if we do, we want to make it feel like Shane in the voiceover. As it's written, you can hear Shane grappling with himself, with his own choices. That's intentional on our part, like, hey, I'm also part of the problem. I'm also on this journey of self-discovery.\u201d\nSeason Two of Human Footprint,\u2019 including \u2018Dressed to Kill,\u2019 is now available on the PBS channels and Apps."

      "text": "To be a Mexican American living in the United States has always meant a deep-rooted fight to be seen. There\u2019s a constant conflict: \"We gotta prove to the Mexicans how Mexican we are, and we gotta prove to the Americans how American we are,\" Abraham Quintanilla Jr.\u2019s character famously put it in the movie Selena. Then there\u2019s the harmful rhetoric fueled by politicians that paints us as criminals, gang members, and worse.\nGrowing up the daughter of Mexican immigrants who came here in pursuit of a better life, I always felt pressure to assimilate, to be American, to live the \u201cdream\u201d of the country I was privileged enough to be born in. So I tried. I swapped braids for flat irons, and replaced the bold brown liner and fiery red lipstick my aunts wore with light pink gloss. I wanted to be American in the way that felt the most palpable. It wasn\u2019t until college that I began to circle back to my roots\u2014not with some grand cultural awakening, but through small, instinctive moments that felt like returning home. I found myself reaching for that same brown lip liner I once rolled my eyes at; I slipped into plaid flannels I\u2019d sneaked from my brother\u2019s closet, and found armor in the form of chunky gold hoops that made me feel my most comfortable and confident.\nIn today\u2019s political and cultural climate, with ICE raids sweeping through neighborhoods and rampant anti-immigrant discourse, it\u2019s clear that no amount of fitting in can protect us. The act of blending in, of shrinking ourselves, has never guaranteed safety\u2014It has only cost us connection. So now, many Mexicans and Mexican Americans are choosing to be seen in the loudest, most unmistakable way: by wearing their culture on their sleeves\u2014literally. I\u2019ve noticed this among peers, and I\u2019ve noticed it on TikTok, where other children of Mexican immigrants are documenting this intentional sartorial shift.\n\u201cBeing in a corporate environment that is predominantly white, I wanted to take space\u2014and use style\u2014to start a conversation about my culture and where I come from, especially because it\u2019s often overlooked,\u201d Michael Anthony N. Gonzalez, a 24-year-old working in fashion merchandising in , tells me of his viral video, in which he wears a blue and white plaid shirt reminiscent of the 1960s Chicano Movement. \u201cIronically, many of the people who say fashion isn\u2019t political are the same ones who get uncomfortable when I dress in a way that reflects my identity. That alone proves how political fashion really is.\u201d\nGonzalez\u2019s story isn\u2019t unique\u2014it\u2019s part of a broader wave of young Mexican Americans reclaiming space through style, even when it means standing out. For Maritza Ortiz, a 24-year-old legal administrative assistant based in Newport Beach, California, that choice came with a deep desire to honor her family. \u201cWith everything happening around ICE raids and mass deportations, I felt hurt,\u201d she says. \u201cImmigrants deserve to be here. We helped build this country.\u201d She began looking for more strategic approaches to showcasing her background at her corporate job. She wore ribbons in her braids in traditional red, white, and green hues, a bold red lip, and even a Virgen Mar\u00eda tee tucked into her baggy jeans. Ortiz would be lying if she said she didn\u2019t notice the stares. \u201cI could feel people looking at me like, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019\u201d she says. But when she shared her story online, her videos struck a chord. Hundreds of Latinas began responding with their own braid selfies. \u201cIt made me feel less alone,\u201d she says. \u201cLike I was part of something bigger.\u201d\nFashion as a vessel for cultural memory runs deep, especially for those living far from home. Ximena Avilez, 28, a Mexican woman living in Maine, tells me that dressing up has always been a bid for connection to her birthplace. After moving to Colorado in her early twenties and encountering blatant racism, she reached for pieces that reminded her of the flea markets and jaripeos she grew up with. \"I wore huaraches, hoop earrings, braids, and a spoon ring engraved with the Aztec calendar,\" she says. She also tattooed her ribs with a line from Pablo Neruda: soy y sigo (I am and I continue). \"It became a mantra and a quiet defiance. I refused to let who I was die.\"\nBut expressing your heritage through style can come at a cost, too. Especially at a time when policy is being shaped by people who reduce our families to case numbers and statistics. The outfit your grandmother wears can make her a target\u2014a reminder that even existing is a risk. Gonzalez remembers being stared at on the bus while wearing the outfit featured in his video. \u201cPassengers left the seat next to me deliberately empty,\u201d he says, recalling another time when a woman told others that \u201cMexican men are robbing women in the area\u201d\u2014while looking directly at him. Avilez remembers the sting of middle school ridicule for speaking Spanish or wearing her hair in braids\u2014small choices that made her a target before she could even understand why.\nStill, all three\u2014and thousands more under TikTok\u2019s #fashionispolitical page\u2014continue to show up. Not just in cultural markers like flannels, boots, or braids, but in the act of dressing without apology. \"We have always used fashion to reclaim space,\u201d says Avilez. \u201cThe Zoot Suit Riots of the 1940s are just one example in which young Mexican Americans were targeted for the way they dressed because their style challenged norms and made them visible. Their fashion became a symbol of defiance. I see myself continuing that legacy every time I choose to wear something that reflects my culture.\u201d\nThat history is heavy and sacred, but it\u2019s also full of joy. As Gonzalez puts it, \u201cI don't need to wear anything specific tied to my culture to make a point. It\u2019s the pride. It\u2019s the boldness. That\u2019s what it feels like to be Chicano and show up in my culture day to day.\"\nFashion has always had a direct connection to survival for us. For so long, we softened ourselves to stay safe, but now we\u2019re refusing to be diluted and reclaiming our Latinidad. In choosing to be seen, we\u2019re making an effort to make our community heard. To honor who we come from and who we are. It\u2019s how we say we\u2019re proud to be Mexican\u2014even when the country we live in tries to make us feel powerless. And in this moment, as history repeats and borders tighten, that pride matters more than ever.\nAqu\u00ed estamos y aqu\u00ed seguimos. Con trabajo, con amor, con orgullo\u2014siempre adelante."

      "text": "\u201cI'm really getting into the world of locking into one outfit for a project,\u201d Trinidad James told me when we spoke last week. The artist, whose name offstage is Nicholaus Williams, had just arrived in LA on a clothing related mission. But he still made the time to talk to me about his fashion projects and the ways that clothing and costume impact his work as a writer and artist.\n\u201cI got a suit we built from scratch with a Black tailor here in LA,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThrash, Thrash Bespoke on Instagram. Sartorial rock star that he is, he made me this red suit that I've been rocking a lot.\u201d\nThe suit is featured in the video and on the cover image for his latest single, My Biggest Hater, which is out now. It is a beautiful example of tailoring, studds lining a shawl collar, candy apple red, slim cut, but roomy enough to accommodate a hoodie. It is playful and elegant in a way that feels serious, with gravitas. The musician has always been more than stylish, he is someone completely comfortable with who he is and what he likes. That confidence is invigorating.\n\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Williams said about the suit, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a part of the music rollout for this year. And then next year I\u2019ll come back with something new. I wanted to do one look this time, really lock in a look for a project and for an era of music and then move to another look, compared to times where I do a lot of different looks.\u201d\nBetween the suit and Williams\u2019 unparalleled ability to accessorize, the clothing in the video adds to the feeling the song evokes, and this is similar in some ways you\u2019ve heard me talk about costume before. But there are significant, important differences between costume in a film or series and costume in the context of what a musician wears to perform. Music is so very personal, the words Williams, as Trinidad James, bends and flexes with such astonishing dexterity, they are his words about his life and his own experiences. I was very curious to know when he felt like clothing became costume.\n\u201cWhen you dress well,\u201d the artist mused, \u201canything could be performed in. But I think there is a big difference, with me at least, there's a big difference, costume for me is for the stage, that's the uniform. When you're talking iconic, we're talking costume. When we're talking just everyday great style, then that's just clothing to me.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a very interesting point, and I thought about all the icons we celebrate and remember, how much of those thoughts are taken up by the wardrobe? Because it is making contributions, absolutely.\n\u201cFor me, it's always more about where the venue is,\u201d Williams continued. \u201cWhat city, what songs I'm performing. Are these songs that feel like, oh, I need to put on the suit? Or are they songs that I feel like I could dress down some, but still be dressed up, like stage ready? We know if it's a full show with a band, then I'm going to put on the costume.\u201d\nTrinidad James talks about clothing regularly in his verses, he\u2019ll mention designers, garments, historic styles, the man knows a lot about clothing. I asked him how he got into it.\n\u201cI mean, I have a fashion based mind,\u201d the musician said. \u201cI was a stylist and I ran a men's boutique before I got into music. My background is actually clothes, and more clothes than actual fashion. I don't care who made it. If it looks good on me, then this is a good piece. Over the years of paying attention to vlogs and having fashion conversations with people who are well studied. There's some people that know everything about clothes, but don't have any. And then you got people who got a bunch of clothes and don't know anything about the clothes they have. You meet enough of those people, you start to find the interests that you like, find the literature that you like, the fashion. Part of it is my knowledge.\u201d\nHe smiled. \u201cAnd then the other part of it is probably what I had on when I was doing the song. When I'm cooking up something, I'm going to use certain ingredients. It'll be an actual theme that we're rapping to, but fashion has to be a part of the bullet points for the overall verse.\u201d\nFor the entirety of his career Williams has been known for his style, for his eye, he is an artist in more ways than one. My regular readers will know how interested I am in processes, in the many different ways there are to bring a creative idea to life. As with his music, the fashion related projects Williams works on have ties to his personal self. So how exactly does he decide which stories, which inspirations, to share in a commercial space?\n\u201cI'm pretty straight to the point,\u201d Williams explained. \u201cAnytime I do something the first time when it comes to design or creativity, I always try to do it from home. When I started with music, like in the All Gold Everything video, Trinidadian flags all through the video. That was something that you\u2019d never really seen in an American video. My next big video I shot was a song called Female$ Welcome. And we shot that in Trinidad and Tobago with Jonathan Mannion. I always think about home first. And with Hommework and our partnership with Saucony, for me, it just made sense.\u201d\n\u201cI also didn't know what my first idea was going to be. I really sat down and thought about it. Our first Saucony collection was four shoes so I had to tell four different stories. It just made sense like, what is something I can tell four different stories about that's going to have some type of educational pull in it, but also be fly and fashionable and at the same time, work in today's market.\u201d\nThe education part is important, and we\u2019ll get back to that in a second.\nWorking in today\u2019s market is an incredibly important consideration, and it is not something that every brand takes seriously, or even considers. To their own detriment, I might add.\n\u201cI can't just base it off of what I like,\u201d Williams said, and I cannot understate how correct he is about this point. Very, very rarely are designers making clothing for themselves.\n\u201cI'm not that type of person,\u201d the artist continued. \u201cI like what I like, I don't care if anybody likes it, because I've been just doing me for so long and it's gotten me so far. But when you make that decision to sell for others, you got to be smart and think of the happy mediums. What you like is what you like and that's your personal opinion and style, but what the consumer is into, that's where you do your homework to find out. And, you know, we're not chasing trends, we're trying to start new ways.\u201d\nThe new practices, the new ideas, this is where the educational part comes back in, and to Trinidad James, it is vital, a part of the practice that matters very much. And from his efforts, the Hommewrk flagship store in Atlanta has grown into the 21st century version of an artist\u2019s salon.\n\u201cWe started the ideation of the brand in 2019,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe planted the seed for designing sneakers in 2018 with Saucony. And 2020 is when we got a chance to do it. The whole saying of \u2018do your homework\u2019 is something that I always say to people just in general.\u201d\nWhen he was in those initial planning stages, it became clear that he wanted to design pieces that would help his clients understand what they like and why they should learn more about that. Williams was reminded of his own educational experiences, which were not great. He told me that while he\u2019d graduated, it felt close for a minute, and that most of his time at school was spent on subjects that seemed pretty irrelevant.\n\u201cSchool wasn't necessarily the most interesting thing for me,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd part of that was the way that the curriculums were taught, you know, learning things that don't feel like what I'm supposed to be learning makes a person like me shut down, or just not be interested or consistent.\u201d\n\u201cIf I make the right clothes,\u201d Williams said, \u201cclothes that I know is fly and works for the consumer, it helps them build their personal style. I always say that we don't sell clothes and shoes. We're really selling confidence.\u201d\n\u201cI'm not forcing a lesson or lecturing at somebody,\u201d Williams said, and he laughed a little. \u201cBut if somebody asks, what does that year on your jacket stand for? Who is this lady in this costume? Or why is this lady on this? How did this lady get drafted to the WNBA? These are good conversation pieces for the consumer, for the person wearing this piece to kind of open up and be a little bit more vulnerable and communicative with who they are. It shows a little bit into themselves if they choose to speak on it, you know?\nAll of this makes sense. If the designs are interesting, innovative, and they are referencing people, movements, work, if they are conversation starters and inspire questions, then it would be hard for anyone to not learn and grow as they loved what they wore."

      "text": "\u201cThe record of fashion pre-photography was painting,\u201d Carrie Ann Baade said to me. We were in the painter\u2019s studio. I'd been invited to come see the dozens of paintings that make up her latest exhibition, \u201cBirthplace: Remembering Louisiana\u2019s Forgotten Women.\u201d The exhibition, at LeMieux Galleries in New Orleans, will be open from January 4 - February 15, 2025. Looking around her workspace, paintings for the show covered the walls and counters, perched or balanced on any available surface. Each portrait was a depiction of a member of Baade\u2019s matrilineal family, mostly women, and all of whom were born or lived between 1690-1740.\nBefore we go any further, it is crucial to understand that before the 19th century photography did not exist. Humans have made camera obscurae for aeons, possibly as far back as the Neolithic era, but we did not figure out how to permanently affix an image onto a surface until roughly 1800 CE. Once that was possible, it still took more than a century of photographic history for the cost of a photo to plummet to an amount affordable to the average person. This means that when we look at the early images, the first decades of portrait photography, the people we see depicted are almost always wealthy. Regular people, and perhaps especially their clothing, are rare photographic subjects before the Great Depression.\nBirthplace, which includes some 20 larger paintings and 48 small ones, simmered beneath the unconscious before Baade ripped through whatever ether and brought them to life. Listening to her talk about the work, I got the distinct impression that this all may have grown out of Baade\u2019s desire to lock eyes with the women who came before her. All families have lore, mysteries and traditions. Exploring the bits which have been lost to time, which (objectively) are often the stories of regular, everyday women, is an impossible thing to do. But artists are not concerned with such trifles, and I have personally witnessed numerous other miracles Baade has achieved.\nThis deep dive into her ancestors, reviving them, was inspired by a challenge from another artist. Baade is a Louisiana native, as is her mother, and she began to work out her family genealogy with a DNA test. \u201cI have now checked 9,000 ancestors,\u201d Baade told me, \u201cwhich is crazy, but in 10 generations you have over 1,000 great grandparents. In 20 generations you have over 1 million great grandparents.\u201d Given the massive number of potential subjects, Baade decided to focus on a narrow slice of history. \u201cThe research going back to the beginning of New Orleans starts at about 1690,\u201d Baade explained. This is the colonial era, almost 20 years before the founding of the Big Easy, the era in her family history Baade found fascinating. \u201cI chose to work from 1690 to 1740, and you know, it's kind of a didactic.\u201d\nBaade is a professor in the College of Fine Arts at Florida State University, so in addition to creating entire universes in oil, she also guides students during the ineffable incubation period an artist goes through between leaving their family home and finding a way to survive on their own in the world.\nSome of Baade\u2019s female ancestors, artists themselves or not, came to America, long before it was the United States, as fille du roi. These were young French women, specifically of marriageable age, whose passage to the \u2018New World\u2019 was covered by King Louis XIV, dowry and trousseau promised and sometimes covered. Literally \u2018the King\u2019s daughters,\u2019 the moniker was an indication of literal state sponsorship, and, though the exact number of ladies is argued, close to 800 women immigrated to New France (land already occupied by indigenous peoples) between 1663-1672, literally doubling the French population.\nOf course there are no images of the people who made these voyages. The oldest photographs of family members Baade found were her grandparents' parents, or maybe a generation earlier. Then there was family lore accompanied by contemporaneous sources that proved documentable. But what did these people actually look like? What would they have worn?\n\u201cEvery single person had their own folder,\u201d Baade told me. \u201cEvery single folder had 20 to 40 images of research; culture, time period, trying to approximate dress. I had terrible moments when I realized that I had put an Edwardian detail on a Regency period piece and had to revise the entire collage because it was totally wrong. Heaven forbid, a fashion historian comes to my opening and goes, that's the wrong hairstyle. But I also changed hairstyles because I'm constantly reading and checking my work, and it's also it's a blend of cultures and so much of what we see is homogenized and it's Eurocentric and it's white. And I mean, these people wouldn't have had their images taken.\u201d\nBut artists tend to work from life, with exceptions of course, from photographs or from models posing. A not-artistic person would be surprised how little of the work that goes into a painting exists strictly within someone\u2019s imagination.\n\u201cI utilized AI to reimagine all the people, based on who they were by origin,\u201d Baade told me. \u201cI used AI to invent who they were and then to pictorialize them. Then, if these two people had a baby, maybe it would look more like her, or if she married this family line knowing that these are French Canadians and these are Romani.\u201d To recreate the clothing, Baade combined painting and collage, beads and textiles. The finished pieces look completely flat, at least until you bring your eye close.\nEach painting is named for the person it depicts, and many are adorned with silver leaf backgrounds, augmented with matte brushstrokes depicting bucolic scenes specific to the woman whose portrait they enhance. Toile de Jouy, that\u2019s the name for this (French) style of fabric, a woven cotton decorated with domesticity. You\u2019ve undoubtedly seen it, though perhaps you might not have known the name. One of Baade\u2019s ancestors lived through a particularly violent and gruesome experience. She gets \u201cmurder toile.\u201d\nFor women who were land owners, \u201cas opposed to a more indigenous mindset,\u201d Baade explained, \u201cI\u2019ve used maps from the same time period and of the same region in their clothing. They might not have identified as a landowner, they wouldn't have conceived of that, they would have not seen a separation between themselves and the land.\u201d It would be impossible to accurately explore this subject matter, during this specific era, without encountering the stories of America\u2019s Indigenous peoples, enslaved peoples and those considered to be undesirable back in Europe, like Romani people. Baade\u2019s gaze does not flinch, and she points her light towards dark places that others might avoid.\nFrom the traditional Ursuline robes and wimple worn by one lady, to the regalia worn by others who intermarried with Iroquois and Algonquins, every figure in this show is a whole person. What people wear, in history and today, is a veritable download of information. Wardrobes tell stories; what a person likes and loves, what they fear, who they idolize. While clothing is not costume, apparel still always tries to give away our secrets. Maybe that\u2019s because we want to talk about who we are and where we come from.\n\u201cI kept sending my family these articles and talking about these incredible stories and they just couldn't imagine it,\u201d Baade told me. \u201cI wanted to make this life, this legacy of Gulf Coast history, which is American history, it\u2019s world history. I wanted to make New Orleans history accessible. Everybody wonders who they are when they look at their nose or at their coloring. We look at facial hair patterns and wonder, who am I? This was always a source of intrigue for my mother's family and I feel like now I can establish, at least in part, who they are. What they looked like, how they dressed.\u201d"

      "text": "\u201cIntellectually I understand my work in one way and just intuitively, I understand it in a different way,\u201d Linda Hall said to me. We met a couple of times over the last month or so to talk about her work. She currently has an exhibition at the Thomasville Center For The Arts, Surface Tension, Hall\u2019s work on her own as well as her collaborations with photographer Becki Rutta.\nHall is an artist, she works largely with textiles and in her hands anything at all can become a notion. \u201cI just love the materials,\u201d she told me. \u201cI'm comfortable with them. They are materials that belong outside of the academy. You know, they\u2019re not traditional art materials. So there's no rules.\u201d\nHall sews creatures and people and animals and monsters, all of them exactly as beautiful as they can make a viewer uncomfortable. Which is a compliment, in case that is not clear. A significant portion of Hall\u2019s work is wearable art; pieces she has created to adorn a person\u2019s body in one way or another and to make different points or arguments. During the Pandemic years she created a collection of Anxiety Masks. Part wearable art, part sculpture, and sometimes part of a performance art, Hall told me a story that makes up a piece of her inspiration to create the masks.\n\u201cBefore the pandemic,\u201d the artist explained, \u201cjust before the pandemic in Jackson, Mississippi, there was an exhibition of Nick Cave's work. I was amazed how his soundsuits were all made from things gathered from thrift stores. He was recalling his deep African roots, its shapes and movements. But what moved me is that his entire body was covered or a person who wears it, their entire body is covered. So they're sort of safe. You can't tell what gender or what ethnicity they are. So they're a cross between a superhero and a suit to protect you, like armor.\u201d\nThey are strange and compelling Hall\u2019s masks, and they will draw from you an emotional response. The wearable component feels intimate. After all, it is not often that the viewer is invited to interact so closely with art. In this instance, a mask becomes a bridge of sorts. We needed more bridges during those years. Things were bleak.\n\u201cIn a lot of these masks,\u201d Hall told me, \u201cthey have these beautiful things that almost look like flowers that are going to explode, buds that are also pustules. They turned out pretty beautiful. The death of George Floyd and issues around race were also very fodder for this series too. And I was relieved that they were Anxiety Masks because there was a lot of anxiety there and there was a lot of darkness. Especially during the pandemic, when there was so much anxiety, just seething under the surface. It gave me a focus. I always had two or three of the masks going at the same time. I found myself really interested in the bubonic plague.\u201d\nThough Covid inflicted many horrors, it did not produce the oozing masses for which the 14th century Black Death was named. Hall found herself thinking about the ways the body and viruses and bacteria interact.\nIt helped, making the work. \u201cIt gave me a place to,\u201d Hall said, \u201cit's a place to aim yourself, to keep your hands busy, keep your mind busy, and feel those feelings a little bit later. You know, I find when I walk into my studio and see it full of these pieces, and I see what they have in common, it sort of informs me of why I did it. There's a gift there to say, wow, I made all this. This is all something that wasn't here before the pandemic. It's evidence that these feelings were felt.\u201d\nI like this idea a lot, it sounds like exorcism, if there can be a positive association with that word. I know that I love my work, but that I can use it to hide, as a place to use up the energy from my own anxieties. \u201cYou know,\u201d the artist said to me, and her eyes were bright, \u201cif more people are like us, this is going to be a very productive four years.\u201d\nThe masks are a small piece of a much larger body of work, but as I\u2019ve indicated above, the materials are a throughline, Hall spends thousands of hours with needle and thread. As my regular readers will know, I am very interested in processes. There are an infinite number of ways to find solutions to creative problems, to work out any conceivable challenge. I love that about art, and I believe this is part of what makes art such a vital component to our culture, why it feeds us when we have appetites we cannot articulate. I asked Hall how she makes her work.\n\u201cUsually what I do is I will take a form that is already made, like a cast of my head,\u201d Hall explained with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll wrap it with fabric, like quilted fabric, so that I'll have something pretty, that I could then put back on later. After I take the form out, I put it on and then cut my eyes out and embellish the surface, so it gives me a very flesh-like sort of heavy surface where I can really add a lot of embellishment to it, that kind of quilted fabric.\u201d\nWhere does she get all this quilted fabric? \u201cI go to thrift stores, antique stores. Friends give me quilts that are falling apart that their grandmother gave them and they don't know what else to do with them. A lot of times I'll start with a quilted fabric that is not a handmade textile; that's going to go underneath. And I sort of let it evolve as it wants to go. I just look at the materials that I have.\u201d\nI asked her if she had figures in mind in advance of the making part, if she felt like there were characters or archetypes. \u201cThey sort of evolve as I make them,\u201d Hall mused. \u201cThey sort of inform me of what they're going to be a lot of times. Intellectually, I think what I'm doing is telling my mother's story, my grandmothers, my great-grandmothers, and giving it a ferociousness that they were never allowed or didn't allow themselves to express, or there was not a place in our culture for them to express it. And I feel like I'm from a generation where I can, you know, have some minor notes. It doesn't all have to be happy and functional and it can be a bit ferocious. Nature is a big theme in my work. And I particularly love it, to have that nature making marks on the surface or being covered with bees or with fur, that sort of thing.\u201d\nMy mother taught me to sew, I\u2019m currently teaching my daughter to sew, and though I know many people who are exceptionally deft with a needle, the largest demographic is absolutely female. I asked the artist who taught her.\n\u201cMy mother sewed,\u201d Hall told me, \u201cmy grandmother and great grandmother sewed and my mother tried to teach me to sew, but it was with the sewing machine and it was so labor intensive. So I think I gained the love of fabrics. And sort of storytelling through them, but I just taught myself by spending time with the materials.\u201d\nSurface Tension, Linda Hall + Becki Rutta is on exhibition at the Thomasville Center for the Arts until June 6, 2025."

      "text": "For Roy Wood Jr., comedy is a way to better understand the human condition.\nJunior, got his start in media in Tallahassee while he was enrolled as a student and Florida A&M University. Since then he's worked as a correspondent on The Daily Show, headlined the White House Correspondents Dinner and released several comedy specials, including Lonely Flowers, which interrogates the impact of isolation on our society.\nWood recently joined Speaking of host Josh Johnson to talk about his career, what he's learned and how comedy has given him the opportunity to connect with people who would otherwise be strangers.\n.\nBelow is an excerpt from their conversation, edited for clarity and brevity. You can also hear the full discussion on Speaking Of!\nJosh Johnson: I really am a fan of you. I love your stand up and how you dive through it. And I've said this before I even heard you say the joke, but you just made it funny, the cashier is sometimes the last line of defense for a person who may be struggling in their personal life.\nRoy Wood Jr.: Correct, That's your last friend. Yeah. Crazy people only got the cashier, or they might have a server if they're regular at a restaurant and they only sit in that person's section. Which is what was interesting about the special I just did for Hulu, Lonely Flowers.\nThat became essentially a dissertation on loneliness and connection, [or] the lack thereof. I didn't start like that. I was just writing jokes. And the more I started looking, there was a commonality to a lot of the jokes. I had about 30 minutes on how you don't have a cashier, gas is pay at the pump. There used to be a buddy come out to the pump, talk to you.\nJohnson: But then I like how you reversed that and said, but for Black folks, we have a different problem, because sometimes we can't lose the person in the store because they follow somebody, follow you around.\nWood: They care so much they would just follow us. Even if we didn't want them to follow, they would just follow us.\nWood: Yeah. So, you have like, 30 minutes on it, and then I just start talking to myself, like, 'all right, well, what do I feel about loneliness? What do I feel about connection? Okay, well, you seen the problem. How do you fix it?' And so that's kind of what that special is. If you look at it in three acts, it's essentially: we are lonely, here are ways we can all try to connect, and here's what happened when I tried one of those ways.\nJohnson: Do you see your work as being the last line of defense for somebody? Because just like that cashier maybe, you know, there's somebody who's watching you right now who's going through the worst part of their life. Do you ever think about that, that you're reaching people that you never know? And does that give any comfort to the work, or are you just doing your thing?\nWood: I'm conscious of it, but I don't let that be the driving star. I don't think any one joke is going to fix anything for anybody, but if it gets you to today...I've got some very, very kind DMs from people who watched the special who are legitimately going through some tough stuff on isolation. So that's cool.\nIt doesn't happen often and not anymore, but in the early days when like the first 5 or 6 years in my career, every now and then after a show, somebody would come up and shake my hand. \u201cHad a good show today. I enjoyed the show. I'm suffering from insert tragedy here..I just came from the funeral of the...I just found out from my doctor that I got the thing,\u201d whatever it was.\nThey would be kind enough to come up and say \u201chey\u201d. And so, I figure fir every person that shakes my hand, that probably represents, you know, 40 or 50 people who don't."
