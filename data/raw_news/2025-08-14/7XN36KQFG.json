      "text": "Best DC Comics stories of all time\nYou voted on the best DC Comics stories of all time, and these are your results\nThe best DC Comics stories of all time feature heroes such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and the rest of the Justice League, all of whom are about to return after being thought dead due to the events of the story Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths, which concludes in December 20's Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths #7.\nAnd true to form, DC is once again drawing on its vast legacy of legendary tales for the latest comic event in the DC Universe - but among those many stories, what are the best DC Comics stories ever told?\nWhether you're a time-worn DC fan who's looking to re-read some favorite comics, or a DC newcomer looking to dip your toes in the comic books that started it all, here are Newsarama's picks for the best DC Comics stories of all time.\n10. Whatever Happened To the Man of Tomorrow?\nHow do you eulogize the history of a character in two short issues? That's the question Julius Schwartz sought to answer, and he hired Alan Moore to do it - and he did with 'Whatever Happened To The Man Of Tomorrow?.'\nWith the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths effectively ending the Silver Age, Schwartz imagined that his last two issues editing the Superman line were to be the last in human history. In two short issues, Alan Moore created a road map through Superman's history that included his most fearsome villains and his closest friends.\nAnd ultimately, he gives the man who has everything the one thing he lacked: a perfect ending. Part of the reason that this is such a pitch-perfect tribute to the Man of Steel is that legendary artist Curt Swan handled the art. He had been drawing Superman since 1948 and from the opening letters \"This is an imaginary story\" to that final, knowing wink from 'Jordan Elliott,' this one feels like a Superman story through and through.\nIt honors the legacy of one of the world's greatest heroes while simultaneously thumbing its nose at the continuity changes that were to take place.\nGet the best comic news, insights, opinions, analysis and more!\nBuy: Amazon\n9. The Return of Barry Allen\nIn the wake of Crisis On Infinite Earths, Wally West became the new Flash, graduating from sidekick to superhero with the death of his mentor Barry Allen. Wally's transition wasn\u2019t without growing pains, however. He failed to gel with readers until Mark Waid began his landmark run on Flash, giving Wally the depth that his predecessor had often lacked.\nWhile it\u2019s hard to argue that there was ever a lull in Waid's original Flash run, 'The Return of Barry Allen ' is likely its apex. In this story, Wally is confronted with the return of the deceased Barry Allen \u2013 a story that, under another writer's pen, might have been heartfelt schmaltz, but for Waid, was an examination of Wally's ascent to true heroism, and the moment that solidified him as the one true Flash.\nOver the course of six issues, Wally and Barry struggle to share the mantle of the Flash until the truth of the return is revealed. Written in a conversational style reminiscent of Wally recounting the tale to a friend, it's as much a conversation between Waid and readers about legacy and heroism as it is between the characters on the page.\n'The Return of Barry Allen' is something of an unsung pioneer of modern comic books, blending an everyman perspective with a modern narration and a grasp of classic ideals that make it one of the best examples of late 20th-Century superhero storytelling, and one of the best DC stories of all time.\nBuy: Amazon\n8. The Judas Contract\nWhen 'The Judas Contract' began in New Teen Titans #42, the surprise wasn't Terra's apparent heel turn. Marv Wolfman and George P\u00e9rez had spent nearly a year introducing Terra to the Titans and making her part of the group and then letting readers in on her terrible secret months before the Titans would learn her true nature.\nThe shock of that issue was just how totally and thoroughly she and Deathstroke owned the Titans because she knew all of their secrets at that point. At the height of their creative energies, Wolfman and Perez's stories were about the unique individuals that made up the Titans. All of the characters are so strong that the introduction of a wildcard like Terra to the team was a great way to shake things up.\n'The Judas Contract' also focuses on the story of Dick Grayson versus Deathstroke as the two warriors maneuver their allies to counter the other's forces, culminating in the one-time Robin's transition to his new superheroic persona as Nightwing.\nJust as Grayson moves out of his mentor's shadow, this story proves that the Titans are much more than just a Justice League junior varsity team.\nBuy: Amazon\n7. Sinestro Corps War\nFor years, the Green Lantern Corps stood as the universe's best and brightest, defending the galaxy through the use of the most powerful weapon in the cosmos \u2014 their emerald power rings.\nBut with the action-packed space opera epic 'The Sinestro Corps War,' Geoff Johns and Dave Gibbons, along with A-list artists such as Ivan Reis and Patrick Gleason, showed Hal Jordan and company they weren't the only ring slingers in town.\nFeaturing the debut of the fear-powered Sinestro Corps, 'Sinestro Corps War' was a pivotal moment for the Green Lanterns as both an organization and as a franchise, with a murderer's row of iconic DC supervillains thrown against the team, including Parallax, Cyborg Superman, Superboy-Prime, and the Anti-Monitor himself.\nYet this book also had key moments of the Green Lanterns rising to this unprecedented challenge, with beats such as John Stewart trading interstellar sniper fire with the hermit crab-like creature known as Bedovian, the Guardians revoking their eons-old edict against killing, or the promotion of Daxamite Green Lantern Sodam Yat as the new, all-powerful Ion as he tackles the unstoppable Kryptonian Superboy-Prime.\nCulminating with some huge battles and personal redemptions, 'Sinestro Corps War' also led to a greater expansion of the Green Lantern universe as a whole, hinting at the rise of five more corps based on the colors of the emotional spectrum. This explosion of creativity and action not only solidified this as one of the greatest Green Lantern stories but one of the greatest DC stories in history.\nBuy: Amazon\n6. The Dark Knight Returns\n30+ years after its original four-part release, Frank Miller, Klaus Janson, and Lynn Varley's The Dark Knight Returns is undeniably one of the most powerful Batman stories ever told. A violent tale acted out behind a backdrop of Cold War paranoia and nightmares of a teenage uprising, The Dark Knight Returns follows Batman as he comes out of retirement to wage war against a Gotham City that will no longer tolerate one man taking the law into his own hands.\nMiller's Bruce Wayne is a silver-haired cowboy dropped into an '80s dystopia, a burly bag of aching bones who finds himself physically outmatched by a new generation of vicious gangs and the return of his arch-nemesis the Joker. Finally, as nuclear war breaks out between the U.S.A. and the Soviet Union, it's up to Superman to take down a Batman hell-bent on cleaning up Gotham's streets.\nAlthough written and illustrated when Miller was just 29, The Dark Knight Returns feels like the work of a much older man. It's a satirical look at the evolving media landscape of the '80s when TV became more youth-oriented and even the news began to turn towards entertainment, as exemplified by the many talking heads who narrate the book's events in ways that benefit their own twisted agendas.\nAlthough time and countless issues of a harder-edged Batman have since softened the original impact of Frank Miller's pessimistic take on the World's Greatest Detective, its place in comic book history cannot be understated. For that reason alone, 'The Dark Knight Returns' deserves a place in every reader's library.\nBuy: Amazon\n5. The New Frontier\nIn a modern era of cynicism in comic books, the late Darwyn Cooke was able to showcase the latent optimistic potential of the DC Universe in the now-classic New Frontier. The story is everything that Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns aren't, with DC's marquee characters exhibiting their best traits and inspiring the world and readers alike to fight towards a better tomorrow at the dawn of the nuclear age. Cooke captures an America fresh from World War II and before a cultural shift where the only way comic books could be respected was if they were dragged through the gutter first.\nNew Frontier is unabashed in its love of the superhero as an icon for what humanity could strive towards. Often under-served characters like Martian Manhunter, Wonder Woman, and Adam Strange are given their best interpretations here. Cooke simultaneously gets to the core of these characters and, through this, reinvents them at the same time.\nCooke's art is a perfect marriage of influences from DC's storied history - from Jack Kirby to the Fleischer Superman cartoon and Batman: The Animated Series. Even the creator's art style brings out the best of DC's Silver Age with each hero smiling into the sunrise in a post-war art deco style. Darwyn Cooke's magnum opus, New Frontier is a portrait of DC's best side and embodies all the courage and hope that these characters represent in a perfect love letter to the Silver Age of comic books.\nBuy: Amazon\n4. All-Star Superman\nGrant Morrison's intent with the 12-issue series All-Star Superman, one that took almost three years to finish its original publication run, was to create a Superman story that was both fresh and timelessly classic. He does so by tasking the simple question of how Superman would spend his last days on Earth.\nIn a way that's an antidote to his previous exploitative death of the '90s, Superman is seen completing a series of tasks, or 'trials' in the most mythical (or perhaps even biblical) sense. It's a narrative that celebrates everything we have ever loved about the Last Son of Krypton. Morrison funnels his encyclopedic knowledge of the Man of Steel into a singular story in a way that never feels didactic, allowing cameos and appearances from virtually every era of Superman comics without ever needing to crack open the Multiverse to do so.\nStripping the character down to his most heroic of essentials, Frank Quitely makes a career-defining turn on the book, casting the hero as a super relaxed version of a near-omnipotent alien. From the barrel-chested Superman, a logical extension of what the ultimate human being would look like, through to the polar opposite in the vulnerable Lex Luthor, Quitely has a way of capturing both the majesty and the humanity of these characters.\nAll-Star Superman remains a quintessential Superman story for new readers through to those with much deeper long-boxes.\nBuy: Amazon\n3. The Great Darkness Saga\nLegion of Super-Heroes' 'The Great Darkness Saga' is one of the oldest stories on this countdown, and hasn't seen many references in the modern DC Universe, but it stands steadfast as an example of what DC stories can accomplish when they combine the classic with the nouveau and find common ground in disparate ideas.\n'The Great Darkness Saga' tells the tale of Darkseid, dark lord of Apokolips, making his way into the 31st century. The story brought together numerous villains of the Legion of Super-Heroes, uniting them with aspects of the 20th Century DC Universe. It defined the era of the Legion and set the stage for what came for years after.\n'The Great Darkness Saga' is not just the highlight of Paul Levitz and Keith Giffen's run on Legion of Super-Heroes, it's one of the greatest tales of the modern DC Universe, and a prime reason so many fans still clamor for the Legion even when they aren't part of DC's line.\nBuy: Amazon\n2. Crisis On Infinite Earths\nDC's continuity leading up into the '80s was rich with nostalgia but convoluted with inconsistencies, leading to the first real mega-event in the company's history: Crisis on Infinite Earths, which shook DC to its core, remixing its timeline and heralding the beginning of a continuity-shuffling practice repeated every decade since.\nIntroducing the literally Earth-shattering threat of the Anti-Monitor, this Crisis threw together dozens of heroes from across the Multiverse and was the scene of the then-shocking deaths of Barry Allen and Supergirl. Marv Wolfman and George P\u00e9rez juggled a universe full of characters, packing together more panels and action in one issue than many modern series fit into a trade. Earths lived and Earths died, resulting in a true epic that has withstood the test of time 30 years later.\nThe legacy of Crisis also cannot be overlooked, with the streamlined continuity establishing Wally West as the new Flash, and launching into well-received series such as John Byrne's Man of Steel, Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli's Batman arc 'Year One' and George P\u00e9rez's Wonder Woman run.\nBuy: Amazon\n1. Kingdom Come\nKingdom Come, Mark Waid and Alex Ross's tale of the old guard of DC heroes facing obsolescence in a world protected by a younger and more vicious generation of superheroes is just as powerful now as it was when it was first published in 1996.\nThanks to Waid's understanding of the titanic personalities he handles, his presentation that makes them feel human instead of lofty gods, and Ross' gorgeous painted visuals, Kingdom Come is often the first book mentioned when people are asked what their favorite DC stories are.\nWhile Kingdom Come stands as an emotional testament to Mark Waid's almost superhuman knowledge of the DCU and Alex Ross's immense talent behind a brush, it also rewards readers who find themselves coming back again and again to Waid and Ross's dystopian Elseworlds series.\nWhether it is the fact that Ross used the image of his own father, a reverend himself, as the inspiration for point-of-view character Norman McCay or Waid's cameo-filled final showdown that still reveals new heroes amid the din of battle, this story feels new with every reread despite being on shelves for over 20 years.\nKingdom Come is a classic in every sense of the word, and continues to stand as the best story that DC has produced \u2013 and with 2021 marking the 25th anniversary of the story's release, we expect some renewed attention from DC.\nBuy: Amazon\nI'm not just the Newsarama founder and editor-in-chief, I'm also a reader. And that reference is just a little bit older than the beginning of my Newsarama journey. I founded what would become the comic book news site in 1996, and except for a brief sojourn at Marvel Comics as its marketing and communications manager in 2003, I've been writing about new comic book titles, creative changes, and occasionally offering my perspective on important industry events and developments for the 25 years since. Despite many changes to Newsarama, my passion for the medium of comic books and the characters makes the last quarter-century (it's crazy to see that in writing) time spent doing what I love most."

      "text": "Marvel and DC are pulling out all the stops for their new crossover by bringing in comics legend Frank Miller to write and draw a story that pits Old Man Logan Wolverine against the Dark Knight Returns Batman\nFrank Miller made his name on Wolverine and Batman \u2013 and now he's returning to both\nAs part of Marvel and DC's new crossover \u2013 their first in over 20 years \u2013 legendary creator Frank Miller will return to both Wolverine and Batman by writing and drawing a back-up story that presents perhaps the ultimate comic book brawl: Old Man Logan vs. Miller's grizzled Dark Knight.\nWhen it comes to legendary DC and Marvel Comics creators, few names stand out as brightly as Frank Miller, who brought superhero comics to a new, more mature audience in the '80s thanks in part to his work on the first Wolverine solo series alongside writer Chris Claremont, and his own Batman epic The Dark Knight Returns.\nWith Marvel and DC now coming together once again for a more creator-focused crossover than their specifically character driven '90s Marvel Vs. DC series, it seems fitting that Miller step back into interior comics with two of the characters that most solidified him as a household name for comic fans, and one of the most influential comic creators ever to grace the medium.\nAlong with the story itself, Miller has drafted a variant cover for Deadpool/Batman #1, the Marvel side of the crossover (as opposed to DC's Batman/Deadpool #1), which shows off his 2025 renditions of his Dark Knight Batman, and Marvel's now classic post-apocalyptic Wolverine, Old Man Logan.\nMiller's 2025 style is indeed more eccentric than his classic '80s work. But Miller is a lot like Nicholas Cage in that way. He hit the absolute top of his craft relatively early in his career, proving his mastery of the medium, and he's been allowing himself to experiment more and more ever since.\nHonestly, Miller has nothing to prove at this point, so this story feels like a nice victory lap for a comic creator whose work has touched countless fans and inspired legions of creators who followed him, and a fitting return to two of his most well-loved works.\nDeadpool/Batman #1 goes on sale September 17.

Marvel told me I could do that or I could write a comic starring Deadpool and Batman with the best Batman artist of our generation. I no longer needed a break,\" Wells states. \"In Batman we've found someone who has even less time for Deadpool's antics than Wolverine, but a city-wide threat from the Joker makes strange bedfellows (literally, if Deadpool had his way). It's been a blast letting Deadpool loose in Gotham City and watching what happens.\"\n\"Am I dreaming? This crossover is likely to be the high point of my career...and, I've had a great career,\" Capullo adds. \"Some of my earliest work (many years ago) was on X-Force, so Deadpool and I go way back.

      "text": "The best Marvel Comics stories of all time\nThe ten best Marvel Comics stories from the House of Ideas\nThe best Marvel Comics stories of all time have often transcended media, with many of the MCU's most popular movies adapting classic comic tales.\nBut there will always be something uniquely special about reading - or re-reading - the original comic books and experiencing those stories in their earliest incarnation.\nSo without further ado, here are Newsarama's picks for the best Marvel Comics stories ever.\n10. X-Men: Days of Future Past (1981)\nThe original X-Men story 'Days of Future Past ' was simply two issues of the main ongoing series, Uncanny X-Men #141 and #142 (Take that, 200+ issue events of today!) In a dystopian future, mutants have been rounded up into concentration camps; that is, the ones who haven't been slaughtered.\nAdult Kitty Pryde's consciousness travels back in time to stop the assassination of a prominent government figure (in the story, Senator Robert Kelly) by Mystique and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.\nWhile she succeeds, and the world is avoided (at least in one timeline), there are some lasting effects. Rachel Summers, a prominent character in today's X-Men titles, came from that alternate future. So did the hyper-advanced Nimrod Sentinel, which has been a key antagonist in the current X-Men era.\nThe storyline was adapted into the 2014 feature film, one of the most highly-regarded of the Fox X-Men franchise.\nGet the best comic news, insights, opinions, analysis and more!\nBuy: Amazon\n9. Annihilation (2006)\nIn 2006, Marvel Comics decided they were going to ignite the cosmic corner of the Marvel Universe. Writer Keith Giffen was tapped to conceive a limited series and a set of tie-ins titled Annihilation, intended to establish characters new and old as major players in the Marvel universe.\nThe story, told entirely apart from the mainstream Marvel Universe without the input of heroes like the Avengers and X-Men, letting the more obscure cosmic heroes take the spotlight - eventually leading to the formation of a new version of the Guardians of the Galaxy, who became the basis for the popular MCU version of the team.\nIndeed, the Guardians of the Galaxy movie franchise literally would not have come to pass without Annihilation having redefined Star-Lord, Groot, and Rocket, and bringing that group of heroes together in the first place.\nBuy: Amazon\n8. Fantastic Four: The Coming of Galactus (1965)\nLong before anyone could even conceive of carving out a whole corner of the Marvel Universe devoted to cosmic threats, Jack Kirby and Stan Lee created what may still be considered the ultimate cosmic threat: Galactus.\nFirst appearing in Fantastic Four #48-50, the godlike being from beyond the stars came careening into the solar system and the lives of Marvel's First Family, widening the entire scope of the Marvel Universe in the process.\nBoth the Silver Surfer and The Watcher also made their debuts in 'The Coming of Galactus,' with the latter becoming a burgeoning figure in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with the recent What If...? animated Disney Plus series.\nBuy: Amazon\n7. Daredevil: Born Again (1986)\nThere was a time when Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli could basically do no wrong, and 1986-1987 was simply a magical period for the pair, who essentially reinvented major street-level vigilante heroes for both Marvel and DC in the span of about a year and a half - including, most importantly for this list, Marvel's Daredevil.\nThe pair's arc together on Daredevil #227-231 (with some ancillary work in #232 and #233) has it all: romance, intrigue, religion, and of course tons of action. There\u2019s The Kingpin, Ben Urich, Nuke, and Captain America. This story basically tears Daredevil down to virtually nothing and lets him emerge, 'Born Again,' into a better, stronger hero than ever before.\nNow, Daredevil: Born Again is being adapted into an 18-episode Disney Plus streaming show.\nBuy: Amazon\n6. Secret Wars (1985)\nNo, not 2015-16's Secret Wars - but the original!\nBack in 1984, Marvel Comics and toy makers Mattel had the big idea to team up for a joint toyline and accompanying comic book series featuring all the biggest heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe in one story, resulting in Secret Wars, the first major Marvel crossover event.\nSecret Wars set the mold for later Marvel events with its own 12-issue limited series, as well as tie-in stories told through ten other comics. Secret Wars pitted a veritable who's-who of Marvel heroes and villains against each other, with the results being an occasionally goofy but still exciting and even defining story with ramifications that spiraled out across the entire Marvel Universe.\nSpider-Man's black Symbiote suit (that was really Venom), She-Hulk on the Fantastic Four, the second Spider-Woman Julia Carpenter - they all got their start in Secret Wars, along with even more storylines and character changes that continued to play out in a much less well-received sequel just a few years later.\nNow the original Marvel Comics crossover event and its 2015 sequel will form the basis of the officially announced Avengers: Secret Wars film.\nBuy: Amazon\n5. X-Men: Age of Apocalypse (1995)\nIn the late '90s, Marvel proclaimed they were going to cancel the entire X-Men line, then at the height of its immense popularity, and replace it with a whole new slate of titles - and lo they did, reimagining the entire X-line in an alternate reality with a vastly different status quo.\nThe result was four months of alternate-reality comic books titled 'Age of Apocalypse,' which turned the entire X-Men franchise on its head with new roles and new relationships for almost all the line's characters.\nSet in a timeline where Charles Xavier died before founding the X-Men and Apocalypse is the unquestioned ruler of the world, 'Age of Apocalypse' presented readers with wildly different takes on Nightcrawler, Cyclops, Wolverine, Magneto, Rogue, and many, many more.\nThough an event as massive as 'Age of Apocalypse' is never without its hiccups, the story took fans by storm - with some of the new versions of the characters even making it into the mainstream Marvel Universe after the story concluded and the classic X-Men timeline was restored.\nIt's looking like the X-Men franchise will pay homage to the original Age of Apocalypse in a similarly themed 2023 event titled Sins of Sinster.\nBuy: Amazon\n4. Civil War (2006)\nOne of the newest stories on our list, Marvel's Civil War asked the question, 'Whose side are you on?'\nCivil War starts with a bang (so sorry) as the New Warriors, while trying to subdue a B-list villain, are involved in a resulting explosion that kills 600 people (including many children and the New Warriors themselves) at a Stamford, Connecticut elementary school.\nAs a result, the US government fast-tracks legislation called the Superhuman Registration Act, requiring anyone with powers and abilities beyond that of a mortal person to register with the government - thereby revealing their identity, with the caveat that they must train with government-approved heroes if they want to keep using their powers.\n(The concept of the SHRA was somewhat adapted into the MCU as the Sokovia Accords).\nUltimately, this leads to Iron Man leading the pro-registration side and Captain America leading the anti-registration folks, with the two sides going all-out in a superhero civil war - a war with real consequences with major deaths.\nTony Stark becomes Director of SHIELD, while Captain America is assassinated, leading to a much deeper, longer-term rift between many of Marvel's heroes.\nMarvel loved this story so much it was adapted to film in the blockbuster Captain America: Civil War and led to a comic book sequel, Civil War II.\nBuy: Amazon\n3. Amazing Spider-Man: The Night Gwen Stacy Died (1973)\nOutside of the death of Uncle Ben, Amazing Spider-Man #121-122 may be the most important issues in the entire life of Peter Parker. The story said it right there in the title. They spoiled the outcome. They told the truth.\nThis would be 'The Night Gwen Stacy Died.'\nNorman Osborn, back as the Green Goblin, takes Gwen Stacy - Pete's girlfriend at the time - and throws her off a bridge. Just when it looks like Spider-Man successfully saves her, his webbing catches her ankle ... but the sudden stop snaps her neck.\nGwen's death was utterly tragic, and a true surprise - devastating Peter Parker (and many readers) like almost nothing before or since. It's heartbreaking and shocking, and in 1973, it was something that made people look at comic books, especially superhero comic books, in a very different way.\nBuy: Amazon\n2. X-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga (1980)\nTo this day 'The Dark Phoenix Saga ' is the story that all other X-Men stories are held up to. The first seeds of the tale began way back in 1976 when Jean Grey first came into contact with the Phoenix Force in X-Men #101-108. Then the 'Dark' part hit four years later in #129-138, as Jean comes under the influence of the Hellfire Club.\nA masterpiece of a story by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, this epic holds some true marquee moments for the team both as a whole and as individual members.\nCyclops battles Mastermind on the psychic plane. Wolverine takes on a seemingly endless stream of Hellfire Club soldiers. Oh, and Jean Grey, as the Dark Phoenix, goes berzerk, eats a sun (killing an orbiting planet's entire population), and goes on trial for genocide.\nWhen Jean manages to gain control of herself for one short moment, she sacrifices herself to end the Dark Phoenix, dying in Cyclops' arms.\nOver the next few years (and several retcons), some of the pivotal moments would later be backtracked to bring back Jean and the Phoenix Force, but none of it has managed to cheapen or take away from the original classic.\nBuy: Amazon\n1. Infinity Gauntlet (1991)\nAt this point, if you don't know about Infinity Gauntlet - the seminal Marvel Comics event that took the lead on our poll of the best Marvel stories by a wide margin - you simply haven't been paying attention.\nBringing together basically all of Marvel's heroes at the time to take on the existential threat of Thanos the Mad Titan and his quest for the Infinity Stones, which hold the power to remake reality itself, Infinity Gauntlet tells the story of what happens when the heroes actually fail - a somewhat unprecedented story at the time.\nOf course, the heroes manage to overcome their defeat and win the day, restoring the universal destruction caused by Thanos, but not before the entire landscape of the Marvel Universe is changed by the experience - and not entirely for the better.\nInfinity Gauntlet has it all - an unbeatable foe, an incredible creative team in Jim Starlin, George Perez, and Ron Lim, and a conglomeration of the world's greatest heroes involved in cosmic action with the highest stakes possible.\nEven if you haven't read Infinity Gauntlet (and you should!), you probably know some of the story's broad strokes from its two-part MCU adaptation as Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.\nBuy: Amazon\nLove comics but don't know where to start? Here's our guide to comic shops and what to expect.\nChris Arrant covered comic book news for Newsarama from 2003 to 2022 (and as editor/senior editor from 2015 to 2022) and has also written for USA Today, Life, Entertainment Weekly, Publisher's Weekly, Marvel Entertainment, TOKYOPOP, AdHouse Books, Cartoon Brew, Bleeding Cool, Comic Shop News, and CBR.
