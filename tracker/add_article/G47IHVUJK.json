      "summary": "U.S. President Donald Trump is meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska for a high‑stakes summit aimed at ending the Ukraine war and reshaping European security. Trump seeks to position himself as a dealmaker and global peacemaker, while Putin hopes to secure Russia’s gains and block Ukraine’s NATO aspirations. The talks risk legitimizing Putin and sidelining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, raising concerns about a deal that may not align with Ukraine’s interests. Both leaders face significant domestic and international scrutiny, and the summit’s success remains uncertain as their demands diverge sharply.",
