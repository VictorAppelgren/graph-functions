  "content": "1 The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d). However, the Company considers certain non-IFRS financial measures as useful additional information in measuring the financial performance and condition of the Company. These measures, which the Company believes are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the Company\u2019s performance, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other publicly traded companies, nor should they be construed as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS measures, included anywhere in this press release, include \u201cAdjusted Net Income\u201d, \u201cAdjusted Net Earnings per Share (on a basic and diluted basis)\u201d, \u201cAdjusted Operating Income\u201d, \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d, \u201cFree Cash Flow\u201d, \u201cFree Cash-Flow (after IFRS 16 lease payments)\u201d and \u201cNet Debt\u201d. The relevant IFRS financial measure, as applicable, and a reconciliation of certain non-IFRS financial measures to measures determined in accordance with IFRS are contained in the Company\u2019s Management Discussion and Analysis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and in this press release.\n\nPat D\u2019Eramo, Chief Executive Officer, stated: \u201cWe are very pleased with our performance in the second quarter. Margins were notably higher compared to the first quarter, reflecting continued progress. Vehicle production volumes increased quarter over quarter, as inventories returned to a more normal level. We continue to execute well and are driving results through operating improvements and efficiencies, cost reductions, and ongoing investments in machine learning and other innovations that are enhancing productivity. On the trade front, USMCA-compliant auto parts are exempt from tariffs, which is positive for us and our industry. We have tariffs on some product that we get from our Tier 2 suppliers and from parts affected by steel and aluminum tariffs but, overall, our exposure is manageable. Given operational improvements, actions we are taking with our previously announced SG&A improvement program, and anticipated recoveries from customers, we expect to offset a substantial portion of the impact. As such, we are maintaining our 2025 outlook, which calls for total sales of $4.8 to $5.1 billion, Adjusted Operating Income Margin ( 1 ) of 5.3% to 5.8%, and Free Cash Flow ( 1 ) of $125 to $175 million.\u201d\n\nNet Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA (1) ratio, excluding the impact of IFRS 16, ended the second quarter at 1.50x, down from 1.64x in the first quarter of 2025 and at our target of 1.50x or better.\n\nFree Cash Flow ( 1 ) (excluding principal payments of IFRS 16 lease liabilities) was $72.0 million, up almost 40% year over year.\n\nAdjusted Operating Income Margin ( 1 ) of 6.8%, up 50 basis points year over year, and 150 basis points over the first quarter of 2025.\n\nDiluted net earnings per share of $0.52 and Adjusted Net Earnings per Share ( 1 ) of $0.66.\n\nTORONTO, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Martinrea International Inc. (TSX : MRE), a diversified and global automotive supplier engaged in the design, development and manufacturing of highly engineered, value-added Lightweight Structures and Propulsion Systems, today announced the release of its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025, and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share.\n\nHe continued: \u201cI am pleased to announce that we have been awarded new business representing approximately $40 million in annualized sales at mature volumes, consisting of $18 million in Lightweight Structures with Stellantis and other customers, and $22 million in our Flexible Manufacturing Group with Volkswagen\u2019s new Scout Motors division, and Volvo Truck. New business awards over the last four quarters total $175 million in annualized sales at mature volumes.\u201d\n\nPeter Cirulis, Chief Financial Officer, stated: \u201cOverall, we are pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter and first half of 2025. We are in good shape operationally and doing well managing what is in our control. Sales for the second quarter, excluding tooling sales of $76.3 million, were $1,199.2 million. Adjusted Operating Income(1) was $86.1 million, and Adjusted Operating Income Margin(1) of 6.8% was up 50 basis points year over year and 150 basis points over the first quarter of 2025. Free Cash Flow(1) (excluding principal payments of IFRS 16 lease liabilities) was $72.0 million, up almost 40% year over year, mainly reflecting positive working capital flows. We are confident in our ability to meet our 2025 outlook, particularly on Free Cash Flow(1), which is likely to come in at the high end of the range or better, given opportunities we are seeing to reduce capital expenditures and optimize working capital. We said we would become a consistently solid Free Cash Flow(1) generator, and we are proving that to be the case.\n\nRob Wildeboer, Executive Chairman, stated: \u201cWe are pleased with our second quarter results, which demonstrate that we are exceptional operators. We invested in the business in the second quarter, and paid down debt, which brought our Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA(1) ratio to our target of 1.50x or better. While we are encouraged by the latest developments on trade, particularly as it relates to tariff exemption for USMCA-compliant auto parts, we will wait to see how the tariff discussion and overall macro environment unfolds over the coming months before committing to further share buybacks. In the meantime, we are prioritizing balance sheet strength and debt repayment. On behalf of the executive management team, we would like to thank our people for their hard work and flexibility in these dynamic times, as well as our shareholders and other stakeholders for their ongoing support.\u201d\n\nAll amounts in this press release are in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated; and all tabular amounts are in thousands of Canadian dollars, except earnings per share and number of shares.\n\nAdditional information about the Company, including the Company\u2019s Management Discussion and Analysis of Operating Results and Financial Position for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 (\u201cMD&A\u201d), the Company\u2019s interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 (the \u201cinterim financial statements\u201d) and the Company\u2019s Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2024 can be found on the Company\u2019s profile at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\nResults of operations may include certain items which have been separately disclosed, where appropriate, in order to provide a clear assessment of the underlying Company results. In addition to IFRS Accounting Standards (\"IFRS\") measures, management uses non-IFRS measures in the Company\u2019s disclosures that it believes provide the most appropriate basis on which to evaluate the Company\u2019s results.\n\nThe following tables set out certain highlights of the Company\u2019s performance for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. Refer to the Company\u2019s interim financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 for a detailed account of the Company\u2019s performance for the periods presented in the tables below.\n\nThe Company prepares its interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS. However, the Company considers certain non-IFRS financial measures as useful additional information in measuring the financial performance and condition of the Company. These measures, which the Company believes are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the Company\u2019s performance, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other publicly traded companies, nor should they be construed as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS measures include \u201cAdjusted Net Income\u201d, \u201cAdjusted Net Earnings per Share (on a basic and diluted basis)\u201d, \u201cAdjusted Operating Income\u201d, \"Adjusted EBITDA\u201d, \u201cFree Cash Flow\u201d, \"Free Cash Flow (after IFRS 16 lease payments)\", and \u201cNet Debt\u201d.\n\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of IFRS \u201cNet Income\u201d to Non-IFRS \u201cAdjusted Net Income\u201d, \u201cAdjusted Operating Income\u201d and \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d:\n\n*Adjustments are explained in the \"Adjustments to Net Income\" section of this Press Release\n\n*Adjustments are explained in the \"Adjustments to Net Income\" section of this Press Release\n\nThree months ended June 30, 2025 to three months ended June 30, 2024 comparison\n\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated sales for the second quarter of 2025 decreased by $26.3 million or 2.0% to $1,275.5 million as compared to $1,301.8 million for the second quarter of 2024. The total decrease in sales was driven by year-over-year decreases across all operating segments.\n\nSales for the second quarter of 2025 in the Company\u2019s North America operating segment decreased by $4.2 million or 0.4% to $980.4 million from $984.6 million for the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was due to lower year-over-year OEM production volumes on certain light vehicle platforms, including the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Wagoneer, the Ford Escape and Maverick, and Nissan Pathfinder and Rogue; and programs that ended production during or subsequent to the second quarter of 2024, specifically the Chevrolet Malibu, an aluminum engine block for Stellantis, and the Ford Edge. These negative factors were partially offset by an increase in tooling sales of $48.3 million, which are typically dependent on the timing of tooling construction and final acceptance by the customer; higher year-over-year production volumes of certain platforms including the Ford Mustang Mach E, General Motors' Equinox/Terrain, General Motors' large pick-up truck and SUV platforms, Mercedes' electric vehicle platform (EVA2), a transmission for the ZF Group, and the Lucid Air; the launch and ramp up of new programs during or subsequent to the second quarter of 2024, including General Motors' new electric vehicle platforms (BEV3/BET), and the Toyota Tacoma; and the impact of foreign exchange on the translation of U.S. denominated production sales, which had a positive impact on overall sales for the second quarter of 2025 of $25.7 million. Overall second quarter industry-wide OEM light vehicle production volumes in North America decreased by approximately 3% year-over-year.\n\nSales for the second quarter of 2025 in the Company\u2019s Europe operating segment decreased by $18.3 million or 6.4% to $268.7 million from $287.0 million for the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was due to a decrease in tooling sales of $9.7 million, which are typically dependent of the timing of tooling construction and final acceptance by the customer; lower year-over-year OEM production volumes on certain platforms, including aluminum engine blocks for Ford and Mercedes, the Mercedes' electric vehicle platform (EVA2), and Jaguar Land Rover; and programs that ended production during or subsequent to the second quarter of 2024, specifically the BMW Mini. These negative factors were partially offset by the launch and ramp up of new programs during or subsequent to the second quarter of 2024, including Volkswagen's new electric vehicle platform (PPE), and a transmission for Audi; higher year-over-year OEM production volumes on certain platforms, including a transmission for the ZF Group, and the Lucid Air; and the impact of foreign exchange on the translation of Euro denominated production sales, which had a positive impact on overall sales for the second quarter of 2025 of $13.8 million. Overall second quarter industry-wide OEM light vehicle production volumes in Europe decreased by approximately 2% year-over-year.\n\nSales for the second quarter of 2025 in the Company\u2019s Rest of the World operating segment decreased by $5.4 million or 14.5% to $31.8 million from $37.2 million in the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was largely driven by lower year-over-year production volumes with Jaguar Land Rover and BMW in China, and a decrease in tooling sales of $1.5 million.\n\nOverall tooling sales increased by $38.2 million (including outside segment sales eliminations) to $76.3 million for the second quarter of 2025 from $38.1 million for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nSix months ended June 30, 2025 to six months ended June 30, 2024 comparison\n\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated sales for the six months ended June 30, 2025 decreased by $181.9 million or 6.9% to $2,443.8 million as compared to $2,625.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The total decrease in sales was driven by year-over-year decreases across all operating segments.\n\nSales for the six months ended June 30, 2025 in the Company\u2019s North America operating segment decreased by $83.1 million or 4.3% to $1,865.4 million from $1,948.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease was due generally to lower year-over-year OEM production volumes on certain light vehicle platforms, including the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Wagoneer, the Ford Escape and Maverick, Nissan Pathfinder and Rogue, General Motors' large pick-up truck and SUV platforms, and Mercedes' electric vehicle platform (EVA2); and programs that ended production during or subsequent to the corresponding period of 2024, specifically the Chevrolet Malibu, the Ford Edge, and an aluminum engine block for Stellantis. These negative factors were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on the translation of U.S. denominated production sales, which had a positive impact on overall sales for the six months ended June 30, 2025 of $71.0 million; the launch and ramp up of new programs, including General Motors' new electric vehicle platforms (BEV3/BET), and the Toyota Tacoma; higher year-over-year production volumes on certain platforms, including Ford Mustang Mach E, the Lucid Air, General Motors' Equinox/Terrain, and a transmission for the ZF Group; and an increase in tooling sales of $58.3 million which are typically dependent on the timing of tooling construction and final acceptance by the customer. Overall industry-wide OEM light vehicle production volumes during the six months ended June 30, 2025 decreased in North America by approximately 4% year-over-year.\n\nSales for the six months ended June 30, 2025 in the Company\u2019s Europe operating segment decreased by $97.0 million or 15.6% to $524.0 million from $621.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease was due to lower year-over-year OEM production volumes on certain platforms, including aluminum engine blocks for Ford and Mercedes, the Mercedes' electric vehicle platform (EVA2), and Jaguar Land Rover; programs that ended production during or subsequent to the corresponding period of 2024, specifically the BMW Mini; and a decrease in tooling sales of $41.9 million which are typically dependent on the timing of tooling construction and final acceptance by the customer. These negative factors were partially offset by the launch and ramp up of new programs, including Volkswagen's new electric vehicle platform (PPE), and a transmission for Audi; higher year-over-year production volumes of certain platforms including the Lucid Air, and a transmission for the ZF Group; and the impact of foreign exchange on the translation of Euro denominated production sales, which had a positive impact on overall sales for the six months ended June 30, 2025 of $18.1 million. Overall industry-wide OEM light vehicle production volumes during the six months ended June 30, 2025 decreased in Europe by approximately 3% year-over-year.\n\nSales for the six months ended June 30, 2025 in the Company\u2019s Rest of the World operating segment decreased by $3.4 million or 4.9% to $65.6 million from $69.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease was largely driven by a decrease in tooling sales of $2.6 million, and lower year-over-year production volumes with Jaguar Land Rover and Mercedes.\n\nOverall tooling sales increased by $14.4 million (including outside segment sales eliminations) to $118.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025 from $104.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nThree months ended June 30, 2025 to three months ended June 30, 2024 comparison\n\n\n\nThe gross margin percentage for the second quarter of 2025 of 14.5% increased as a percentage of sales by 0.4% as compared to the gross margin percentage for the second quarter of 2024 of 14.1%. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales was generally due to productivity and efficiency improvements at certain operating facilities and other improvements; partially offset by an increase in tooling sales which typically earn low margin for the Company, and operational inefficiencies at certain other operating facilities.\n\nSix months ended June 30, 2025 to six months ended June 30, 2024 comparison\n\n\n\nThe gross margin percentage for the six months ended June 30, 2025 of 13.8% increased as a percentage of sales by 0.2% as compared to the gross margin percentage for the six months ended June 30, 2024 of 13.6%. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales was generally due to productivity and efficiency improvements at certain operating facilities and other improvements; partially offset by:\n\u2022 overall lower production sales volume and corresponding contribution;\n\u2022 an increase in tooling sales which typically earn low margin for the Company; and\n\u2022 operational inefficiencies at certain other operating facilities.\n\n\n\nOverall market related inflationary pressures on labour, material and energy costs, along with offsetting commercial settlements, were generally stable year-over-year.\n\nAdjusted Net Income excludes certain items as set out in the following tables and described in the notes thereto. Management uses Adjusted Net Income as a measurement of operating performance of the Company and believes that, in conjunction with IFRS measures, it provides useful information about the financial performance and condition of the Company.\n\nThree months ended June 30, 2025 to three months ended June 30, 2024 comparison\n\nSix months ended June 30, 2025 to six months ended June 30, 2024 comparison\n\n\n\n(1) Restructuring costs\n\n\n\nAdditions to the restructuring provision during the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 totalled $13.8 million and $30.6 million, respectively, and represent employee-related severance resulting from the rightsizing of certain operations in Germany, Canada, Mexico, and the United States.\n\nAdditions to the restructuring provision during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 totalled $5.4 million and $11.6 million, respectively, and represent employee-related severance resulting from the rightsizing of certain operations in Germany, Mexico Canada, and the United States.\n\nThree months ended June 30, 2025 to three months ended June 30, 2024 comparison\n\n\n\nNet Income, before adjustments, for the second quarter of 2025 decreased by $2.9 million to $38.1 million or $0.52 per share, on a basic and diluted basis, from Net Income of $41.0 million or $0.54 per share, on a basic and diluted basis, for the second quarter of 2024. Excluding the adjustments explained in Table A under \"Adjustments to Net Income\", Adjusted Net Income for the second quarter of 2025 increased by $3.4 million to $47.8 million or $0.66 per share, on a basic and diluted basis, from $44.4 million or $0.58 per share, on a basic and diluted basis, for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nAdjusted Net Income for the second quarter of 2025, as compared to the second quarter of 2024, was positively impacted by the following:\n\u2022 a $2.7 million year-over-year decrease in finance expense as a result of decreased debt levels and lower borrowing rates on the Company's revolving bank debt; and\n\u2022 a lower effective tax rate (28.8% for the second quarter of 2025 compared to 29.4% for the second quarter of 2024).\n\n\n\nThese factors were partially offset by the following:\n\u2022 a net foreign exchange loss of $1.7 million for the second quarter of 2025 compared to a gain of $1.9 million for the second quarter of 2024; and\n\u2022 a $1.2 million year-over-year increase in research and development costs driven generally by increased new product and process development activity.\n\nSix months ended June 30, 2025 to six months ended June 30, 2024 comparison\n\n\n\nNet Income, before adjustments, for the six months ended June 30, 2025 decreased by $29.1 million to $55.6 million or $0.76 per share, on a basic and diluted basis, from Net Income of $84.6 million or $1.10 per share, on a basic and diluted basis, for the six months ended June 30, 2024. Excluding the adjustments explained in Table B under \u201cAdjustments to Net Income\u201d, Adjusted Net Income for the six months ended June 30, 2025 decreased by $15.2 million to $77.3 million or $1.06 per share on a basic and diluted basis, from $92.5 million or $1.20 per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nAdjusted Net Income for the six months ended June 30, 2025, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2024, was negatively impacted by the following:\n\u2022 a net foreign exchange loss of $3.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to a gain of $6.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024; and\n\u2022 a higher effective tax rate (29.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to 27.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2024).\n\n\n\nThese factors were partially offset by the following:\n\u2022 a year-over-year decrease in SG&A expense, as previously explained; and\n\u2022 a $6.2 million year-over-year decrease in finance expense as a result of decreased debt levels and lower borrowing rates on the Company's revolving bank debt.\n\nA cash dividend of $0.05 per share has been declared by the Board of Directors payable to shareholders of record on September 30, 2025, on or about October 15, 2025.\n\nMartinrea International Inc. is a leader in the development and production of quality metal parts, assemblies and modules, fluid management systems, and complex aluminum products focused primarily on the automotive sector.

  "summary": "Martinrea International Inc. (TSX: MRE) has reported its second quarter results and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share. The company considers certain non-IFRS financial measures as useful additional information to measure its financial performance and condition. These measures, which do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, do not necessarily represent those of other publicly traded companies. The Company's performance was particularly pleased with margins significantly higher in Q2, with vehicle production volumes increasing quarter over quarter and a 6.8% Adjusted Operating Income Margin. Free Cash Flow (1), excluding principal payments of IFRS 16 lease liabilities, was $72.0 million, up almost 40% year over year. The Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio ended at 1.50x, down from 1.64x in the first quarter of 2025 and at its target of 1.60x or better. The CEO, Pat D\u2019Eramo, stated that the company's exposure to tariffs was manageable and that USMCA-compliant auto parts are exempt from tariffs, given operational improvements and anticipated recoveries from customers, and that it is maintaining its 2025 outlook for total sales of $4.8 to $5.1 billion.",
