  "description": "Phoenix Financial Ltd (XTAE:PHOE) reports robust earnings, driven by asset management growth and strategic market positioning, while addressing potential risks and future targets.",
  "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus. For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\u2022 Phoenix Financial Ltd (XTAE:PHOE) reported a strong first half of 2025 with comprehensive income of 1.5 billion shekels and a return on equity of 27%.\n\u2022 The company has a robust capital position, liquidity, and a good solvency ratio, which supports its growth and dividend distribution strategies.\n\u2022 Asset management activities showed significant growth, with over a 40% increase year-over-year, contributing 426 million shekels in the first half.\n\u2022 Phoenix Financial Ltd (XTAE:PHOE) announced a dividend of 400 million shekels and doubled its annual buyback program to 200 million shekels.\n\u2022 The company is well-positioned to capture opportunities in the Israeli market, supported by long-term structural trends such as population growth and wealth accumulation.\n\u2022 Despite strong performance, the company faces potential risks from interest rate sensitivity, although this is partially mitigated by the implementation of FRS 17.\n\u2022 The insurance segment's profitability was partially offset by non-operating effects, mainly due to capital market performance and interest rate impacts.\n\u2022 Phoenix Financial Ltd (XTAE:PHOE) operates in a highly fragmented market, which may pose challenges in capturing market share.\n\u2022 The company's growth strategy relies heavily on international partnerships and market trends, which could be affected by global economic conditions.\n\u2022 While the company has shown strong growth, there is a need to continuously update targets and strategies to maintain this momentum, which could be challenging.\n\u2022 Take a short quiz to get matched with a financial advisor who understands your goals - no pressure, just real support. Q: Phoenix demonstrated accelerated growth in core activities, especially in asset management. Is this sustainable for the long run? A: Yes, this growth is sustainable for the long run. We have built strong platforms and have a substantial advantage in the insurance business. We see significant market opportunities and believe our market share in insurance, currently at 15-16%, has room to grow. In asset management, we are just beginning to tap into the potential, especially with our large client base. Q: Your market cap has increased during the past year. Where do you plan to go from here? A: While I prefer to focus on business performance rather than share price, I can say that we have significantly increased our profits over the past few years. We continue to work hard to improve the business and create value, leveraging strong platforms like brokers and advisors and asset management.\n\nQ: In your presentation, you pointed to the opportunity for asset managers and insurers in Israel. Do you expect the shift in value creation to happen in Israel in the coming years, and what are you doing to capture this shifting value? A: Israel is following trends seen in other markets, such as the US and UK, where financial institutions are capturing more value from traditional banks. We believe this trend will accelerate in Israel, and Phoenix is well-positioned to capture this value due to our strong market position and strategic initiatives. Q: This is the third consecutive quarter you're showing a return on equity of over 20%. Will the ROE targets be updated? Is this the new level we should expect? A: We see the recent ROE levels as representative and plan to update our targets in the fourth quarter. The current levels are sustainable, and we will also consider profit multiples alongside ROE in our future assessments. Q: You're showing high profitability and strong cash flows. Is there a plan to increase dividends? A: Our current dividend policy is to distribute at least 40% of profits, and at least 50% including buybacks. We have moved from semiannual to quarterly dividends, and our strong cash flows support this policy. Q: You mentioned that your 2025 run rate is within the 2027 target range. When do you plan to update targets, and are they expected to be around the guidance published in March? A: We plan to update our targets during the fourth quarter of 2025. We are already performing within the 2027 target range and believe our numbers are sustainable and growing. Q: How is IFRS 17 implementation expected to impact your corporate account allocations and mix? A: IFRS 17 reduces the exposure of liabilities to interest rates, allowing us to optimize our portfolio for risk-adjusted returns. This change will enable us to achieve higher yields in the long term. Q: In relation to Phoenix agencies, what are your plans after the deal closes? A: We see strong growth potential in Phoenix agencies, which currently holds a 7% market share in a fragmented market. We are building our management team and platform to drive this business forward, and we believe there is significant potential for growth and value creation.
