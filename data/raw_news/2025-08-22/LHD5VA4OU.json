  "content": "Apple One allows you to subscribe to a bundle of up to six of Apple's services for a discounted all-in-one monthly price, and its value just went up.\n\n\n\nThe reason why Apple One just became more valuable is because Apple TV+ received a price increase this week in the U.S. and select other countries. In the U.S., for example, the cost of the service increased from $9.99 per month to $12.99 per month. However, Apple One plans with Apple TV+ did not receive any corresponding price increases.\n\nThere are three Apple One tiers, all with Apple TV+ included:\n\nAll in all, you can now potentially save even more money by switching to Apple One as opposed to paying for Apple TV+ and other services separately.\n\nAlternatively, you can switch to the annual Apple TV+ subscription, which also avoided a price increase. In the U.S., that plan remains available for $99 per year.\n\nMany streaming services like Disney+ and HBO Max offer annual plans at a discount compared to paying for 12 months individually, although it is worth keeping in mind that there is an opportunity cost to paying in full upfront.\n\nThis is a win-win situation for Apple, which gains an instant revenue boost from customers who stick with the monthly Apple TV+ plan, while boosting the appeal of its Apple One and annual Apple TV+ plans with a higher spend or longer commitment.",

      "text": "Apple TV+ Price Increase Announced\nApple today raised the monthly price of its Apple TV+ streaming service to $12.99 in the U.S., according to 9to5Mac's Benjamin Mayo.\nApple TV+ cost just $4.99 per month in the U.S. when it launched in 2019, but the price has now increased three times. The price went up to $6.99 per month in 2022, and then to $9.99 per month in 2023, and now the service costs $12.99 per month. The latest price increase applies to select other countries too.\nAn annual subscription to Apple TV+ will continue to cost $99 in the U.S., and Apple One bundle prices are not changing, the report said.\nThe new price is effective immediately for new Apple TV+ subscribers, but various free trial options remain available. For existing subscribers, the price increase will take effect 30 days after their next renewal date, the report said.\nIn a statement shared with 9to5Mac, Apple attempted to justify the price increase by noting that it has continued to expand its library of original content, and it touted the value of its Apple One plans with multiple Apple services.\nMany other streaming services like Disney+ and Netflix have raised prices in recent years.\nPopular Stories\nWe're only weeks away from Apple's annual iPhone event \u2013 rumored to take place on September 9 \u2013 and along with the new iPhone 17 series, we're going to get a new version of the Apple Watch Ultra for the first time since 2023.\nBy the time the Ultra 3 is unveiled, it will have been two years since the previous model arrived.

      "text": "Apple One is an all-in-one bundle that allows Apple device customers to purchase several services together in one package instead of separately, saving money for those who use multiple Apple service products.\nOur dedicated Apple One guide covers everything that you need to know about the Apple One bundles.\nBundle Options\nThere are three Apple One bundle options to provide different levels of service access to customers at different price points.\n- Individual ($19.95 per month) - Includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and 50GB iCloud storage.\n- Family ($25.95 per month) - Includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and 200GB of iCloud storage, with the services able to be shared between up to six family members.\n- Premier ($37.95 per month) - Includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Fitness+, and 2TB iCloud storage, with the services able to be shared between up to six family members.\nThe Individual plan offers savings of $9 per month compared to purchasing the services individually, while the Family plan offers savings of $11 per month.\nThe highest-priced Premier plan offers the greatest savings, saving customers $29 per month compared to purchasing each service separately.\nThe tiers were originally priced at $14.95, $19.95, and $29.95, but Apple increased prices by a few dollars for renewals starting in late 2022 due to increased licensing costs for Apple Music and Apple TV+ content. Prices for standalone plans with those services increased at the same time.\nAnother round of price increases occurred in late 2023 for Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and Apple News+, pushing Apple One prices higher as well.\nApple's Available Services\nFor those who are unfamiliar with Apple's available service offerings, we've created a list with short descriptions of what each one features along with links where you can get more information before deciding whether to purchase a bundle.\n- Apple Music ($10.99 per month) - Priced at $10.99 per month for an individual subscription and $16.99 per month for a family subscription, Apple Music is Apple's streaming music service, akin to Spotify. It works natively in the Music app on Apple devices and on the HomePod, and it offers access to 70 million songs.\n- Apple TV+ ($9.99 per month) - Apple TV+ is a service similar to Netflix or Disney+ that offers Apple's catalog of original television shows and movies. Apple doesn't have as much content as other streaming services, but is working on growing what's available and there are dozens of TV shows in the works.\n- Apple Arcade ($6.99 per month) - Apple Arcade offers up access to more than a hundred games for the $4.99 per month fee, and games are free from in-app purchases with all content unlocked. Apple teams up with popular game developers to create games for the Apple Arcade service, and new games are added on a regular basis.\n- Apple News+ ($12.99 per month) - Apple News+ offers access to hundreds of different magazine titles that can be accessed through the Apple News app. It also provides access to several paid newspaper sites such as The Wall Street Journal and The Los Angeles Times. It's a paid extra add-on for the standard Apple News app.\n- Fitness+ ($9.99 per month) - Fitness+ is an Apple Watch adjacent service that offers guided workouts across multiple fitness categories. Workout videos are watched on iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV with workout data calculated in tandem using Apple Watch.\n- iCloud Storage - Apple offers 5GB of iCloud storage free to all users for backups, storing photos, and more, but additional 50GB, 200GB, and 2TB paid plans cost $0.99, $2.99, and $9.99 per month, respectively, in the United States. In September 2023, Apple added even larger 6TB ($29.99 per month) and 12TB ($59.99 per month) tiers.\n- Additional iCloud Features - Apple One enables access to iCloud Private Relay and Hide My Email, features that are now part of the paid iCloud+ plans.\nFamily Sharing\nThe full access to the Family and the Premier plans can be shared between six family members, including the person who sets up the Bundle access.\nThe Individual plan is designed for use by a single person, but even with the Individual plan, the Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade services included can be shared with other family members.\nSharing subscriptions with multiple family members works through the Family Sharing feature available for Apple devices. Each person on the Family and Premier plans can sign into services with their own Apple ID through Family Sharing (which is also how it works with individual services) so all family members can get private access and personalized recommendations.\nMultiple Apple IDs\nFor Apple device users who continue to have multiple IDs split across iCloud services and iTunes/App Store purchases and subscriptions, Apple has a system in place to handle the dual Apple IDs within a single Apple One Bundle, with more information available through an Apple support document.\nFree Trials\nThere is a free one-month trial available for the Apple One bundle, but there's a catch -- you can only trial services where you haven't already had a free trial experience. You cannot get a second free trial for Apple services that you have already experienced or subscribe to.\nDevice Availability\nApple One bundled services can be accessed on iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, Apple TV, HomePod, and Apple Watch. Apple One services are also available on non-Apple platforms depending on where support is available.\nAn Apple Music subscription through Apple One can, for example, be accessed on Android devices, while Apple TV+ subscriptions available through Apple One can be accessed on smart TVs or any other platform that supports the Apple TV app.\nExtra iCloud Storage\nThe Individual Apple One plan comes with 50GB of iCloud storage, the Family plan comes with 200GB, and the Premiere plan comes with 2TB. Those who need more storage than is provided through Apple One can purchase additional iCloud storage separately, which means with the most expensive Apple One bundle, a maximum of 4TB is available.\nCustomers who subscribe to Apple One can also choose other storage amounts for a different mix, such as 50GB with Apple One and 200GB through a separate iCloud purchase, but a total of 4TB is available. That would cost $29.95 for the Apple One plan with 2TB storage and then an additional $9.99 for the 2TB iCloud plan.\nPeople who have separate Apple IDs for media and iCloud can use both accounts with Apple One, but there's no option to stack the storage in the same way. In this situation, the Apple One storage plan replaces the current storage plan.\nGuide Feedback\nHave questions about the Apple One bundles or want to offer feedback on this guide?
