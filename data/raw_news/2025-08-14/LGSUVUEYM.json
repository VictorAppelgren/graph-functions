  "description": "Breaking: Smithsonian Unveils New \"Trump-Approved\" History Exhibits Revolutionary War airports, living Frederick Douglass among featured attractions The Smithsonian Institution announced this week it's undergoing a \"comprehensive review\" to ensure all...",
  "content": "The Smithsonian Institution announced this week it's undergoing a \"comprehensive review\" to ensure all exhibits align with President Trump's interpretation of American history. After months of pressure from the White House, museum officials have begun implementing what they're calling \"historically accurate and constructive descriptions\" across their collections.\n\nHere's your sneak peek at the exciting new exhibits coming to America's most beloved museums:\n\nThe crown jewel of the renovated collection features a stunning diorama of Continental Army forces storming British-controlled airports in 1775. Visitors can watch a holographic George Washington coordinate air traffic control while his troops \"man the air\" and \"ram the ramparts\" simultaneously.\n\nThe exhibit includes an authentic replica of a Wright Brothers biplane (manufactured in 1776, naturally) and features interactive displays where children can practice Revolutionary War-era TSA procedures. Don't miss the gift shop's bestseller: \"Paul Revere's Midnight Flight\" snow globes.\n\nNational Museum of American History: \"The War That Didn't Need to Happen\"\n\nA new Civil War exhibit explains how President Andrew Jackson was \"really angry\" about the conflict and could have prevented it entirely if he hadn't been so busy being dead for 16 years. The display features a touching recreation of Jackson's ghost appearing to Abraham Lincoln, saying \"There's no reason for this\" while pointing to a map of airports that wouldn't exist for another century.\n\nInteractive elements include a \"What Would Jackson Do?\" decision tree that invariably leads to the conclusion that slavery could have been \"worked out\" through better negotiation tactics.\n\nNational Museum of African American History: \"Frederick Douglass: Still Going Strong\"\n\nPerhaps the most ambitious renovation features a live actor portraying Frederick Douglass, who Trump noted \"is being recognized more and more\" in present tense. The 206-year-old abolitionist (looking remarkably good for his age) gives hourly talks about his ongoing work and recent social media presence.\n\nVisitors frequently ask how Douglass has maintained his vitality since 1895. Museum guides explain it's through a combination of good genes and the power of being \"recognized more and more.\"\n\nThe museum's new geopolitics wing features a detailed timeline of how Ukraine invaded Russia, complete with maps showing Ukrainian forces storming the Kremlin. The exhibit carefully explains how this totally happened and definitely wasn't the other way around, despite what the \"fake news media\" might claim.\n\nA companion display explores other historical reversals, including how Canada burned down the White House during the War of 1812 (it was actually British troops, but who's counting?).\n\nA hard-hitting expos\u00e9 reveals how Joe Biden appointed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chairman, conveniently ignoring the fact that Trump himself made this appointment in 2017. The exhibit features a dramatic recreation of Biden traveling back in time to 2017 to secretly influence Trump's decision-making process.\n\nInteractive elements include a \"Blame Game Wheel\" where visitors can spin to determine which Democrat is responsible for various Trump administration decisions.\n\nThe contemporary art wing now features an immersive experience called \"Living in Your Own Reality,\" where visitors can walk through a maze of mirrors that reflect only what they want to see. The centerpiece is a digital display showing Trump's inauguration crowd, which magically grows larger every time someone looks at it.\n\nThe gallery's mission statement reads: \"Truth is whatever feels right in the moment, and facts are just opinions with better PR.\"\n\nMuseum officials stress that these changes reflect their commitment to \"scholarly excellence\" and \"accurate, factual presentation of history.\" As one curator explained while updating a placard to read \"The Civil War (1861-1865): A Totally Avoidable Misunderstanding,\" the goal is simply to present American history in a way that makes everyone feel good about themselves.\n\nThe White House has given museums 120 days to complete these \"content corrections,\" replacing what officials call \"divisive or ideologically driven language\" with \"unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions.\"\n\nCritics argue the changes represent a dangerous politicization of historical institutions. Supporters counter that it's about time American museums started telling the real story of our nation's past\u2014you know, the one where everything makes perfect sense and nobody needs to feel uncomfortable about anything.\n\nAdmission remains free, though visitors are encouraged to bring their own alternative facts in case the museum runs out.\n\nThe Smithsonian's new exhibits open to the public next month. Advanced tickets are available, but hurry\u2014they're selling faster than Continental Army fighter jets.\n\nShare this article on Bluesky, Facebook, and X/Twitter.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this companion article of Trump\u2019s Presidential Museum for his devout disciples (Gory be!).",

      "text": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to allow a \"major lawsuit\" against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to proceed, escalating his pressure on the central bank leader to cut interest rates.\nTrump said in a Truth Social post that the suit would relate to Powell's management of pricey renovations at the Fed's headquarters in Washington, D.C., which the president has previously criticized.\nTrump did not say when that suit could be filed or by whom.\n\"Jerome 'Too Late' Powell must NOW lower the rate,\" Trump wrote in the post.\n\"Steve 'Manouychin' really gave me a 'beauty'when he pushed this loser,\" Trump wrote, referring to his first-term Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin having encouraged him to nominate Powell as Fed chair in 2017.\n\"The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable. Fortunately, the economy is sooo good that we've blown through Powell and the complacent Board,\" Trump claimed.\n\"I am, though, considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed because of the horrible, and grossly incompetent, job he has done in managing the construction of the Fed Buildings.\"\n\"Three Billion Dollars for a job that should have been a $50 Million Dollar fix up. Not good!\" he wrote.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to share more about the potential lawsuit when asked for clarification later Tuesday.\n\"He's considering a lawsuit, and I won't speak on it any further. I will allow the president to do that,\" Leavitt said.\nThe Fed declined to comment on Trump's post.\nPowell and the Fed have previously defended the ongoing renovations of two historic buildings in D.C., which house the central bank, and explained why costs have risen during the projects.\nPowell pushed back on Trump to his face last month when the president visited the construction site and claimed that renovation costs had topped $3.1 billion.\n\"I haven't heard that from anybody,\" Powell said then.\nTrump has railed against Powell for months as he pressured the central bank to quickly slash interest rates by multiple percentage points.\nTrump claims that doing so would save the United States vast sums of money by reducing the cost of borrowing to finance government operations.\nAfter raising the benchmark federal funds rate in 2022 in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Fed gradually cut interest rates multiple times in 2024, the final full year of President Joe Biden's term in office.\nBut it has kept rates steady throughout 2025 so far, defying Trump's demands.\nIn congressional testimony in July, Powell said the Fed would have already cut rates this year if Trump had not implemented his major tariff policy.\nFed officials in June indicated they expect two rate cuts this year.\nTraders currently anticipate a quarter-point rate reduction following the Federal Open Market Committee's September meeting. Expectations have risen for further cuts after FOMC meetings in October and December.\n\u2014 CNBC's Erin Doherty contributed to this report."

      "text": "Donald Trump made an awkward blunder during his speech on Independence Day, praising the army, which he said \u201ctook over the airports\u201d from the British during the revolutionary war in the late 1700s.\nTrump made the mistake during his hour-long speech at the Lincoln memorial in Washington DC as part of his 4th of July \u201cSalute to America\u201d celebrations, which saw him become the first US president in nearly 70 years to address the country on Independence Day.\nIn a departure from his usual style of rambling, impromptu speeches in which the president lurches between topics at high speed, Trump gave a surprisingly scripted address in which he outlined the history of Independence Day, American achievement in various fields, and then paid tribute to each branch of the military in turn.\nDuring his tribute to the army, Trump said: \u201cIn June of 1775, the Continental Congress created a unified army out of the revolutionary forces encamped around Boston and New York \u2026 The Continental Army suffered a bitter winter of Valley Forge, found glory across the waters of the Delaware, and seized victory from Cornwallis of Yorktown.\n\u201cOur army manned the air, it rammed the ramparts, it took over the airports, it did everything it had to do, and at Fort McHenry, under the rockets\u2019 red glare, it had nothing but victory.\u201d\nAs listeners were quick to point out, air travel did not occur in the US until early in the 1900s. The Wright brothers, whom Trump praised earlier in his speech, are credited with flying the world\u2019s first plane in 1903.\nHowever, this was not the only historical confusion in this section of Trump\u2019s speech. As astute listeners picked out, the battle of Fort McHenry occurred during the war of 1812, and not the American revolutionary war which took place several decades earlier."

      "text": "Fact-checking Trump claims about war in Ukraine\nUS President Donald Trump has appeared to accuse Ukraine of being responsible for the war with Russia, in a flurry of claims from his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Florida.\nSpeaking to reporters, Trump also made claims about President Volodymyr Zelensky's popularity and observed that Ukraine had yet to hold scheduled elections due to martial law. He later doubled down on those comments in a fiery Truth Social post on Wednesday.\nTrump's accusations - some of which appeared to mirror common Russian talking points about the war - came just hours after US officials met a Russian delegation in Riyadh to open talks to end the conflict, which has raged for almost three years.\nZelensky later accused Trump of \"living in a disinformation space\" created by Russia.\nBBC Verify has fact-checked Trump's claims.\nClaim: Zelensky is a 'dictator without elections'\nTrump initially drew attention to the fact that Ukraine has not held a presidential election since 2019, when Zelensky - previously a comedian with no political base - swept to power.\nHe repeated the claims in a Truth Social post in which he accused the Ukrainian leader of being a \"dictator without elections\".\nZelensky's first five-year term of office was due to come to an end in May 2024. However, Ukraine has been under martial law since the Russian invasion in February 2022, which means elections are suspended.\nUkraine's martial laws were drafted in 2015 - shortly after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and years before Zelensky and his Servant of the People party came to power.\nIndependent observers from the OSCE said the 2019 election had been \"competitive and fundamental freedoms were generally respected\".\nZelensky won 73% of the vote in the second-round run-off.\nZelensky has vowed to hold a new election once the conflict ends and has yet to confirm that he intends to stand. Some experts have observed that holding elections in Ukraine before the conflict ends would be practically impossible, as Russian attacks on many cities persist and millions of citizens are displaced abroad or living under Russian occupation.\nTrump's intervention on the subject came just hours after the Kremlin questioned Zelensky's legitimacy as his term in office has ended, a claim Moscow has repeatedly made in the past months. On 28 January, Russia's President Vladimir Putin called Zelensky \"illegitimate\" in an interview with Russian media.\nReferring to the electoral situation, Trump appeared aware that it had been a frequent Russian allegation used to undermine Zelensky, saying in his news conference: \"That's not a Russian thing, that's something coming from me, from other countries.\"\nFor his part, Zelensky has previously said it would be \"absolutely irresponsible to throw the topic of elections\" in the middle of the conflict.\nClaim: 'I hate to say it, but he's down at 4% approval rating'\nPresident Trump also claimed that Zelensky's approval rating has fallen to 4%.\nIt's unclear what source the president was citing as he didn't provide evidence. We have asked the White House to clarify this.\nOfficial polling is limited and it is extremely difficult to carry out accurate surveys during a time of war. Millions of Ukrainians have fled and Russia has occupied around a fifth of the country.\nHowever, some polling has been possible to carry out by telephone. A survey conducted this month found that 57% of Ukrainians said they trusted the president, according to the Ukraine-based Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.\nHowever, that was down from 77% at the end of 2023, and 90% in May 2022 - suggesting that the president has suffered a drop-off in his popularity.\nSome other polls suggest Zelensky trailing his nearest rival, former army chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi, in the first round of any future election, indicating the two would face each other in a run-off.\nIn the wake of Trump's comments, some major Russian media outlets seized on the claim and cited a poll carried out by Ukrainian MP and Zelensky critic, Oleksandr Dubinsky, on Telegram which they claimed backed up Trump's assessment.\nDubinsky has been charged with treason in Ukraine, and accused of \"operating at the behest of Russian intelligence\" - which he denies.\nClaim: 'You should have never started it'\nUkrainian authorities expressed dissatisfaction over not being part of Tuesday's talks in Riyadh. But Trump dismissed these concerns, telling reporters that Ukraine had had three years to end the war, before appearing to blame Kyiv for starting the conflict.\n\"You should have never started it,\" he said. The Kremlin has previously accused Ukraine of starting the war against Russia.\n\"It was they who started the war in 2014. Our goal is to stop this war. And we did not start this war in 2022,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin told US talk show host Tucker Carlson in February 2024.\nUkraine didn't start the war. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, having annexed Crimea in 2014.\nThe annexation came after Ukraine's pro-Russian president was ousted by popular demonstrations.\n- Trump says Ukraine could have made a deal earlier\n- Rosenberg: How Putin and Trump shook up the world in a week\n- Who was at the table at US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia?\nRussia also backed proxy forces who seized areas of eastern Ukraine, and it accused the new government in Kyiv of discrimination and genocide against Russian speakers. The International Court of Justice has rejected Moscow's claims.\nAfter the failure of agreements which aimed to end the post-2014 conflict - Russia began a massive build-up of troops on its border with Ukraine in late 2021.\nPutin launched the invasion on 24 February 2022, stating that the aim of the operation was to \"demilitarise and denazify\" the pro-Western government of Volodymyr Zelensky and prevent the country from joining Nato.\nIn Ukraine's last parliamentary elections, support for far-right candidates was 2%. It should also be noted that Zelensky is Jewish and that his party has been regarded as centrist.\nAnd while Nato officials said in 2021 that Ukraine was a candidate to join the Western alliance in the future, it was not part of any formal process.\nAdditional reporting by BBC Monitoring."

      "text": "White House calls for a 'comprehensive review' of eight Smithsonian museums\nThe Trump Administration sent a letter to The Smithsonian Institution on Tuesday requesting a \"comprehensive internal review\" of eight of its museums with the aim of bringing the organization in line with President Trump's cultural directives ahead of the country's 250th anniversary celebrations.\n\"This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the President's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,\" states the letter, which was addressed to Smithsonian secretary Lonnie Bunch, signed by White House officials Lindsey Halligan, Vince Haley and Russell Vought, and reprinted on The White House's website.\nThe White House said it plans to conduct the process in stages. Among the eight museums included in the first phase are the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.\nThe process will include an analysis of everything from exhibition texts and social media content to the curatorial process and exhibition planning.\nThe letter sets out a detailed list of materials the museums need to submit for White House appraisal, including grant-related documentation, inventories of permanent holdings and visitor surveys. It also lays out a timeline by which The Trump Administration expects parts of the review process to be completed, with specific 30, 75 and 120 day targets.\n\"Within 120 days, museums should begin implementing content corrections where necessary, replacing divisive or ideologically driven language with unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions across placards, wall didactics, digital displays, and other public-facing materials,\" the letter states.\nAt least one Smithsonian museum has already made moves to correct public-facing content. Earlier this month, its National Museum of American History removed references to Trump's two first-term impeachments from an exhibit following a review. The museum later updated the exhibit with an edited version.\nThe Smithsonian said in a statement Tuesday that its work \"is grounded in a deep commitment to scholarly excellence, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history. We are reviewing the letter with this commitment in mind and will continue to collaborate constructively with the White House, Congress, and our governing Board of Regents.\nIn a statement released in June, the institution said its committed to ensuring that it remains \"free from political or partisan influence.\"\n\"The Board of Regents will continue its vigilant, independent oversight of the Smithsonian and its museums to protect their rigorous scholarship and expertise, nonpartisanship, and accuracy, and ensure that the Smithsonian is welcoming to all Americans,\" the statement said.\nThe Smithsonian has found itself embroiled in an ongoing \"culture war\" since Trump took office.\nTrump's March executive order \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History\" directly criticized The Smithsonian for coming \"under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology\" and for promoting \"narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\"\nIn May, Trump claimed he was firing Kim Sajet, the director of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery. She later resigned of her own accord.\nIn late July, artist Amy Sherald canceled an upcoming exhibition of her work at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery after a dispute over her painting of a transgender woman with pink hair and a blue gown, holding a torch, Statue of Liberty-style.\nDespite the requests for piles of documentation and interview with Smithsonian museum staff, Tuesday's letter states the museum review is intended to be a \"constructive and collaborative effort\" and that The White House will not \"interfere with the day-to-day operations of curators or staff.\" But some commentators say the government has no business interfering with museum processes and decisions.\n\"Museums cannot change content to suit a political whim or agenda,\" said Lisa Strong, a professor of art history at Georgetown University. \"The best way for museums to maintain the high public trust they already enjoy is by remaining independent. Museums are staffed by experts in their fields who interpret the collection to help educate the public about art, history, science and culture. Their content should not be reviewed, revised, or edited for political gain.\"\nThe White House said assuming compliance, it anticipates completing its review process early in 2026.\nCorrection Aug. 13, 2025\nA previous version of this story incorrectly indicated that references to President Trump\u2019s two first-term impeachments were permanently removed from an exhibit at the National Museum of American History. The museum has since restored those references, using revised language and placing them in a less prominent location within the exhibit display."

      "text": "Donald Trump, at a breakfast with African-American supporters marking the start of African-American History Month, described famed 19th century abolitionist Frederick Douglass as \u201can example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more.\u201d\nTrump spoke Wednesday about Douglass \u2013 who died in 1895 \u2013 and Martin Luther King Jr. through the context of the National Museum of African-American History and Culture, the newest Smithsonian museum that opened in 2016.\n\u201cI am very proud now that we have a museum on the National Mall where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other things,\u201d Trump said. \u201cFrederick Douglass is an example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice.\u201d\nTrump added: \u201cHarriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and millions more black Americans who made America what it is today. Big impact.\u201d\nSean Spicer, asked about Trump\u2019s comment on Wednesday, sought to clear up how Trump thinks Douglass will be recognized \u201cmore and more.\u201d\n\u201cI think he wants to highlight the contributions that he has made and I think through a lot of the actions and statements that he\u2019s going to make, I think the contributions of Frederick Douglass will become more and more,\u201d Spicer said.\nHonoring Douglass at the start of Black History Month is common for both Democratic and Republican presidents. In 2002, President George W. Bush lauded Douglass\u2019 relationship with President Abraham Lincoln, describing them as \u201ctwo men, very different, who together ended slavery.\u201d\nAnd then-President Bill Clinton urged people to visit Frederick Douglass National Historic Site in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington.\nDouglass was born a slave in Maryland in 1818 and was launched into the pantheon of black leaders when he published an autobiography \u2013 \u201cNarrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American\u201d \u2013 that described his life from slave to statesman and someone who had Lincoln\u2019s ear on slavery and the Civil War."

      "text": "Trump Fuzzy on Andrew Jackson, Civil War History\nPresident Donald Trump delivered pronouncements yesterday (May 1) about President Andrew Jackson and the Civil War that left many people scratching their heads over the current president's interpretation of American history.\nIn an audio interview clip shared on Twitter by the political news radio channel SiriusXM Politics, Trump told Washington Examiner reporter Salena Zito that Jackson was \"really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War,\" adding that Jackson said, \"There's no reason for this.\"\nTrump did not mention a time frame or context for the former president's supposed displeasure concerning what he \"saw.\" However, Jackson died on June 8, 1845, and the American Civil War began in 1861. [6 Civil War Myths, Busted]\nLater that day, Trump reiterated his claims about Jackson in a tweet, insisting that even though Jackson died 16 years before the Civil War began, the former president nonetheless \"saw it coming and was angry.\" Trump added that if Jackson had been leading the country at the time, he \"would never have let it happen!\"\nJackson, like Trump, was considered a Washington outsider. The 19th-century president favored a \"plain and simple\" approach to politics that resonated with voters and won him two terms in the White House. As President, \"he sought to act as the direct representative of the common man,\" according to a biography published online by the White House website.\nA portrait of the late Jackson is prominently displayed in Trump's Oval Office. And Trump has previously acknowledged that he greatly admires Jackson, calling him \"an amazing figure in American history.\" Meanwhile, Trump's supporters have enthusiastically compared the current president to the populist Jackson, The New York Times reported in January.\nBut even a president's admiration must be tempered with reality, and there is little evidence to suggest that Jackson anticipated the Civil War, let alone that he would have been able to stop it, American historian Eric Foner, a professor of history at Columbia University in New York City, told Live Science in an email.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\"Jackson would certainly have opposed secession. He was a very strong nationalist,\" Foner explained.\nJackson adamantly favored a powerful federal government. In 1833, when South Carolina sought to reject a tariff already passed by Congress, Jackson sent armed forces into Charleston; privately, he threatened to hang the opposition leader, according to the White House website's biography of Jackson.\nSo, it seems unlikely that Jackson would have accepted the secession of slave states from the United States. And as far as the Civil War is concerned, it appears equally unlikely that Jackson, as Trump claimed, would \"never have let it happen,\" Foner added.\n\"There is no reason to think that were he alive or president in 1860 to 1861 he would have been any more successful than others in preventing [the] Civil War,\" Foner told Live Science.\nOriginal article on Live Science.\nMindy Weisberger is an editor at Scholastic and a former Live Science channel editor and senior writer.

      "text": "The Trump administration is evidently extending its control of cultural representation at the Smithsonian, the world\u2019s largest museum and research complex.\nIn a letter posted on the White House website, the administration told the Smithsonian that it plans a wide review of exhibitions, materials and operations ahead of the US\u2019s 250th anniversary celebrations in 2026.\nThe letter to Lonnie Bunch, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, from Trump administration officials said the White House wants the museums\u2019 program to reflect \u201cunity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story\u201d in keeping with an executive order issued in March that ordered the elimination of \u201cimproper, divisive or anti-American ideology\u201d from the Smithsonian and its museums.\nMuseums will have 120 days to replace content the administration finds \u201cdivisive or ideologically driven language with unifying, historically accurate and constructive descriptions\u201d.\nDonald Trump\u2019s order from March, titled Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History, said the president \u201caims to ensure that the Smithsonian is an institution that sparks children\u2019s imagination, celebrates American history and ingenuity, serves as a symbol to the world of American greatness, and makes America proud\u201d.\nEarlier in August, the museum removed and later amended an exhibit on US presidential impeachments that mentioned Trump\u2019s two impeachments during his first term. Officials at the Smithsonian later said museum officials \u201cwere not asked by any administration or other government official to remove content from the exhibit\u201d.\nBut Monday\u2019s letter to the institution, which was first obtained by the Wall Street Journal, places the institution under curatorial scrutiny ranging from public-facing exhibition text and online content to internal curatorial processes, exhibition planning, the use of collections and artist grants.\n\u201cThis initiative aims to ensure alignment with the president\u2019s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,\u201d the letter is reported to say.\nIt was signed by Lindsey Halligan, White House senior associate; Vince Haley, the director of the domestic policy council, and Russ Vought; the director of the office of Management and Budget.\nHalligan was appointed to effectuate JD Vance\u2019s oversight of the Smithsonian. In a statement, she said the review was \u201cabout preserving trust in one of our most cherished institutions\u201d.\nHalligan added: \u201cThe Smithsonian museums and exhibits should be accurate, patriotic, and enlightening \u2013 ensuring they remain places of learning, wonder, and national pride for generations to come.\u201d\nThe formal review comes as the Trump administration placed Washington DC\u2019s police department under direct federal control and deployed the national guard into the city, citing a public safety emergency related to crime and homelessness, though data shows a sharp decrease in violent crime.\nIn January, Washington DC police and the US attorney\u2019s office released a report showing that total violent crime in DC in 2024 was down 35% from the prior year, resulting in the lowest violent crime rate in more than 30 years. Meanwhile, data has consistently shown that unhoused people are more likely to be victimized by crimes than commit them.\nThe review will initially focus on eight of the following Smithsonian museums: the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.\nThe White House\u2019s letter said others will be reviewed at a later date.\n\u201cThe Smithsonian\u2019s work is grounded in a deep commitment to scholarly excellence, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history,\u201d the institution said in a statement. \u201cWe are reviewing the letter with this commitment in mind and will continue to collaborate constructively with the White House, Congress, and our governing Board of Regents.\u201d\nThe Smithsonian\u2019s board of regents had previously agreed to conduct a thorough review of all its museum and zoo content to eliminate political influence and bias. That preceded the resignation in June of Kim Sajet, the director of the National Portrait Gallery, who Trump said was involved with diversity initiatives he opposed.\nSeparately, figurative painter Amy Sherald cancelled a career review of her work \u2013 including a portrait of Michelle Obama, the former first lady \u2013 at the Smithsonian over concerns that the institute would not show Trans Forming Liberty, a portrait of a transgender woman with pink hair and a blue dress holding a torch as the Statue of Liberty.\nMonday\u2019s letter later goes further, however, ordering a review of exhibits planned for the US\u2019s 250th birthday. It also is part of a broader push to assert oversight over a broad swathe of cultural and academic institutions.\nThe White House states that museums should correct \u201cdivisive or ideologically driven\u201d language with text that is \u201cunifying, historically accurate\u201d.\nA team from the White House reportedly plans to conduct observational visits and museum walk-throughs to document themes and messaging. The letter also said that the White House had asked to review organizational charts, visitor surveys, exhibited artists who received Smithsonian grants, outside partners and internal communications related to section and approval processes.\nThe outlet said the White House had given 30 days for requested materials to be turned over and that it expected to complete its review by early 2026."

  "argos_summary": "The Smithsonian Institution is undergoing a comprehensive review to align its exhibits with President Trump's interpretation of American history, following pressure from the White House. New exhibits include a diorama of Revolutionary War forces and a Civil War display featuring fictional elements, while interactive features aim to present a sanitized version of history. Critics argue this represents a dangerous politicization of historical institutions, while supporters claim it promotes a unifying narrative. The changes are set to be implemented within 120 days, with the Smithsonian emphasizing its commitment to scholarly excellence amidst these alterations.",
