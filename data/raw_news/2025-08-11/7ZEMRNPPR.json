The whistleblower reportedly worked for Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee for over ten years, and reported Schiff's alleged behavior to the FBI in 2017.According to the report, the intelligence staffer called the leaking \"treasonous\" and \"illegal,\" in addition to being unethical. He was most recently interviewed by the FBI in 2023.COULD SENATOR ADAM SCHIFF REALLY GO TO JAIL OVER ALLEGED MORTGAGE FRAUD?The staffer also said that he personally attended a meeting where Schiff greenlit the leak.\"When working in this capacity, [redacted staffer's name] was called to an all-staff meeting by SCHIFF,\" the documents state, per Just The News. \"In this meeting, SCHIFF stated the group would leak classified information which was derogatory to President of the United States DONALD J. TRUMP. SCHIFF stated the information would be used to indict President TRUMP.\"\"[The whistleblower] stated this would be illegal and, upon hearing his concerns, unnamed members of the meeting reassured that they would not be caught leaking classified information,\" the report added.TRUMP-FOE ADAM SCHIFF DISMISSES TULSI GABBARD'S DECLASSIFIED RUSSIA COLLUSION INTELLIGENCE AS 'DISHONEST'John Solomon, who co-authored the piece with Just The News' Jerry Dunleavy, appeared on Fox News Channel's \"Hannity\" to discuss the report.\"This is the first of several major leak investigations we're going to see over the next several days,\" Solomon said. \"You're going to see other major people that were clearly identified by the FBI, having leaked classified secrets.\"\"Their own staff turned them in when interviewed by the FBI. Nothing, again, happened,\" he added. \"It's a common pattern. The question now is, in Donald Trump's Justice Department, does that dynamic change?\"Soon after the report was published, Patel shared it on X, saying that the FBI \"found it [and] declassified it.\"\"Now Congress can see how classified info was leaked to shape political narratives - and decide if our institutions were weaponized against the American people,\" Patel's post read.Fox News Digital's Brooke Curto contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director William Pulte sent a criminal referral to Attorney General Pam Bondi in May alleging that California Democrat Sen. Adam Schiff \"has, in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, impacting payments from 2003-2019 for a Potomac, Maryland-based property.\"\nWhat is the gist of the complaint? That Schiff, while representing a California district in the House of Representatives, falsely listed his posh Maryland home as his primary residence in order to get more favorable loan terms when, in truth and in fact, his California condo, which he designated as his primary residence in order to qualify for a California homeowner\u2019s tax exemption, was his real primary residence.\nEven worse, according to the referral, Schiff claimed his Burbank condo as his primary/principal residence in California tax filings during the same years he listed his Maryland home as his primary/principal residence on loan applications to finance that home.\nTRUMP INVOKES RUSSIA COLLUSION HOAX WHILE CALLING FOR LONGTIME FOE SCHIFF TO FACE JAIL TIME\nSchiff\u2019s response to the criminal referral and to subsequent Truth Social posts by President Donald Trump was one we often see in white collar cases. Per the senator\u2019s office, \"the lenders who provided the mortgages for both homes were well aware of then-Representative Schiff\u2019s Congressional service and of his intended year-round use of both homes, neither of which were vacation homes.\"\nThat\u2019s not much of a denial, senator. The question is whether you lied on these forms or not. Were your answers accurate or not, and if they were inaccurate, were the answers a mistake or intentional?\nThe devil is always in the details in white-collar cases like this. Which representatives of which particular lenders \"were well aware\" that Schiff intended to use both homes year-round, and why does that matter?\nFEDERAL HOUSING OFFICIAL SUBMITTED SCHIFF CRIMINAL REFERRAL TO DOJ OVER MORTGAGE DOCUMENTS\nThe issue is whether Schiff intentionally lied on federal or state forms to gain a financial advantage. If he falsely listed his Maryland home as his primary residence in order to get a lower interest rate, that matters too. (After all, similar alleged falsehoods by Donald Trump were used by New York Attorney General Letitia James to go after Trump in her massive New York state civil action.)\nDid Schiff lie on California tax forms to gain an exemption he was not entitled to, and, if so, does it implicate any federal criminal statutes? This is what inquiring minds want to know, and we just don\u2019t have enough information at this stage to know all the answers.\nBased on what we do know, how likely is it that Schiff will be indicted for violating one of several federal bank fraud statutes that potentially cover his conduct? Not very likely. Here are several reasons why:\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n- Venue for a federal prosecution would be in Maryland, Washington, DC, or the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The jury pool in each of these districts is overwhelmingly liberal and Democratic. Chances of a conviction are minute unless the crime was blatant and the evidence strong.\nTRUMP ACCUSES 'SCAM ARTIST' SCHIFF OF LYING ABOUT MARYLAND HOME TO COMMIT MORTGAGE FRAUD\n- The statute of limitations for most federal financial fraud crimes is 10 years, and the last allegedly false statement Schiff made on a bank loan form was in 2013. FHFA Pulte\u2019s criminal referral apparently attempts to get around this problem by noting that Schiff\u2019s alleged falsification was done to, \"acquire more favorable loan terms, impacting payments from 2002-2019.\" In other words, the fraud continued until 2019, because Schiff continued to benefit from lower interest rates brought about by his false statements, which brings his conduct within the statute of limitations. This will not work for 18 U.S. Code Section 1014, the federal criminal statute covering false statements on loan applications, because the crime is the false statement itself. It could conceivably work for the general mail, bank, and wire fraud statutes, but this is by no means a sure thing.\nThe devil is always in the details in white-collar cases like this. Which representatives of which particular lenders \"were well aware\" that Schiff intended to use both homes year-round, and why does that matter?\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n- It is not at all clear to me that Schiff wrote anything false at all by listing the Maryland house as his primary residence on a bank loan form. After all, it is where he and his family resided most of the time. We would need to closely examine all pertinent loan documents, including instructions and definitions for how to fill out the forms. Barring an explicit written instruction on the loan documents directing Schiff to designate his primary residence as any house where he was claiming a homestead exemption, he is probably in the clear on a federal bank fraud charge.\nThis leaves open the possibility of a state of California prosecution for filing false tax returns. Would you care to place any bets on that happening? The bottom line is this: Schiff\u2019s alleged conduct may be sleazy and his explanation shifty, but a criminal charge at the federal or state level does not seem to be in the offing."

      "text": "Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is throwing cold water on Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's assertion about the Obama administration's role in pushing the Trump-Russia collusion narrative during the 2016 presidential election.\nGabbard has declassified documents, including a House Intelligence Committee memo, alleging that former President Barack Obama and his national security team \"manufactured an Intelligence Community Assessment they knew was false.\"\n\"I think what Gabbard and her staff are doing is dishonest and misstated, and I'll leave it at that,\" Schiff told Fox News Digital on Capitol Hill.\nBut White House Spokesman Davis Ingle was quick to fire back in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Pencil neck, watermelon head Adam \u2018Shifty\u2019 Schiff was one of the chief propagandists behind the Russia collusion hoax,\" he said. \"He\u2019s now trying to desperately cover his tracks as this entire lie is being exposed to the world.\"\nSchiff was elected to the Senate last year but served in the House while Congress investigated whether Trump colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election.\nNEW RUSSIAGATE EVIDENCE 'DIRECTLY POINT TO' OBAMA, DOJ WILL DECIDE 'CRIMINAL IMPLICATIONS': GABBARD\nAnd as a ranking member and then chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Schiff was directly involved in the congressional investigation and became a leading Democratic voice accusing Trump's 2016 presidential campaign of colluding with Russia.\n\"Should Obama and his team be held responsible in some way for pushing the Russia collusion narrative that was proven false to take down Trump?\" Fox News Digital asked Schiff.\n\"Well, if you read the well-reported intelligence community report, you know they documented Russia's efforts to help denigrate Hillary Clinton, which gave a boost to the Trump campaign,\" Schiff responded.\nSchiff was referring to an Intelligence Community Assessment report from 2017 that asserted that Russia's goals were to undermine faith in the U.S. democratic process and to \"denigrate\" former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"developed a clear preference\" for Trump.\nGabbard's office alleged in a press release outlining the unearthed documents that Putin did not favor a candidate in 2016. It also said, \"There is irrefutable evidence detailing how President Obama and his national security team directed the creation of an Intelligence Community Assessment that they knew was false.\"\nWhen asked if he should apologize, Schiff told Fox News Digital, \"It's been proven accurate.\"\nAnd as he walked away, Schiff seemed to nod in agreement and say, \"Yes,\" when asked if everything he had said about the Russia collusion was accurate.\nThe Justice Department, however, has formed a \"strike force\" to assess the evidence publicized by Gabbard into the Obama administration's role in the Trump\u2013Russia collusion narrative.\nTrump and Schiff have long been political foes, as the president often evoked Schiff's nickname on the presidential campaign trail in 2024 while Trump weaved through a range of topics, including what he has come to refer to as the \"Russia, Russia, Russia hoax.\"\n\"Adam \u2018Shifty\u2019 Schiff is in BIG TROUBLE!\" Trump said on Truth Social on Sunday. \"He falsified Loan Documents. He once said my son would go to prison on a SCAM that Schiff, along with other Crooked Dems, illegally \u2018manufactured\u2019 in order to stage an actual coup.\"\n\"My son did nothing wrong, knew nothing about the fictional story,\" he added. \"It was an American Tragedy! Now Shifty should pay the price of prison for a real crime, not one made up by the corrupt accusers!\"\nThe U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) sent a letter to the Department of Justice in May alleging that Schiff has \"falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, impacting payments from 2003-2019 for a Potomac, Maryland-based property.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Since I led his first impeachment, Trump has repeatedly called for me to be arrested for treason,\" Schiff said after Trump first accused Schiff of mortgage fraud. \"So in a way, I guess this is a bit of a letdown. And this baseless attempt at political retribution won\u2019t stop me from holding him accountable. Not by a long shot.\"\nFox News Digital's Brooke Singman, Emma Colton, Danielle Wallace, and Peter Doocy contributed to this report."

      "text": "Sen. Adam Schiff, once a staunch defender of the Justice Department\u2019s independence, now warns it has become an \u2018Orwellian\u2019 tool for President Donald Trump and ripe for political abuse.\nThe California Democrat and former U.S. prosecutor, who served four House terms before his election to the Senate last fall, has long been an outspoken Trump foe, using his former posts as chair of the House Oversight Committee and impeachment probes to urge a more independent-minded Justice Department.\n\"The rule of law is a core foundation of our nation,\" Schiff previously told Time Magazine during Trump's first term in office. \"No one, not even the president, is above it.\"\nSchiff once served as a federal prosecutor at the Justice Department, where he helped successfully convict an ex-FBI agent on charges of spying for the Soviet Union. Throughout his later service in the House, he repeatedly defended the Justice Department as independent-minded and asserted that its career officials operate above the political fray.\nTRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW BAN ON BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP\nHe also chided his Republican colleagues who, in his view, too harshly criticized the agency, warning them that doing so could lead to an erosion of trust.\nFewer than four years later, however, Schiff is singing a different tune.\nNow in the Senate, the California Democrat is one of the most vocal critics, sounding the alarm about Trump's efforts to reform the Justice Department to his liking.\nOn Monday, he pushed back against Trump's claim that he and other members of the House committee tasked with investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot could be subject to \"investigation at the highest level,\" as the president threatened in a Truth Social post.\n\"The members of the Jan 6 Committee are all proud of our work,\" Schiff wrote on X, in response to Trump's remarks. \"Your threats will not intimidate us. Or silence us.\"\nEarlier this month, Schiff took aim at the current leadership of the Justice Department in a blistering floor speech, noting that the DOJ\u2019s three most senior officials, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and John Sauer, all formerly represented Trump in criminal court proceedings.\nBy so frequently claiming the Justice Department has been improperly \"weaponized\" against him, Schiff said, Trump has arguably given his officials a green light, \"in Orwellian fashion, to do what they have accused others of doing,\" which is \"to weaponize the department. \u2026 To use the department as a sword and as a shield.\"\nWHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY DEFENDS TRUMP'S FIRING OF INSPECTORS GENERAL\nSchiff also blasted the Supreme Court decision last August that expanded the view of presidential immunity \u2013 a ruling, he said, that \"has turbocharged the ability to weaponize the Department of Justice by a president who wishes to use it for that purpose.\"\nLast month, Schiff joined other Democrats on the panel in urging the administration to turn over information that prompted their decision to remove or reassign dozens of career Justice Department officials and FBI personnel.\nLawmakers also cited concerns about a sprawling questionnaire sent by Justice Department officials to thousands of FBI agents and supervisors in January asking detailed questions about their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot investigation.\nFBI AGENTS GROUP TELLS CONGRESS TO TAKE URGENT ACTION TO PROTECT AGAINST POLITICIZATION\nThat questionnaire is also the subject of a lawsuit filed this year by current and former FBI agents, who are seeking to head off any retaliation or discriminatory action against personnel involved in the Jan. 6 probe. A judge is expected to hear from both parties in court later this month.\nMost recently, Trump attempted to strip security clearances and access to federal government buildings for all Perkins Coie employees, a law firm he sees as opposed to his political agenda, prompting a federal judge to step in and block the order.\n\"An American President is not a king \u2013 not even an 'elected' one \u2013 and his power to remove federal officers and honest civil servants like plaintiff is not absolute,\" U.S. District Court Judge Beryl Howell wrote in a court order this month that blocked one of Trump\u2019s executive orders from taking force.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSchiff, for his part, appears to share that view.\n\"There could be no more frontal assault on the post-Watergate policy of having some division between the White House and the Justice Department than the Supreme Court of the United States saying, \u2018Break down that wall. Use the department any way you wish. Create cases where there\u2019s no evidence. Dismiss cases where there\u2019s plenty of evidence. And you will never face accountability. No matter how corrupt a motive,'\" Schiff said this month.\nReached for comment about his evolving views on the Justice Department, Schiff's office pointed Fox News Digital to his previous remarks, including a February interview on MSNBC\u2019s \"The Last Word with Lawrence O\u2019Donnell.\" Asked about his claims that Trump has weaponized the Justice Department \u2013 and the severity of the issue \u2013 Schiff responded, \"We\u2019ve had a debate about what level of constitutional crisis we\u2019re in, and frankly, I think we\u2019re already there.\""

He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is under criminal investigation for mortgage fraud, a Trump administration source told Fox News.\nFox News host Laura Ingraham broke the news on Tuesday night on \"The Ingraham Angle,\" saying the source said a criminal investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Maryland on possible charges involving mortgage fraud.\nThe investigation comes a month after a story broke about the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) sending a criminal referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) alleging that Schiff, in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms.\nIn a 2011 affidavit signed by the then California congressman, Schiff certified that a property in Montgomery County, Maryland, is his primary residence.\nSchiff also owns a condominium in Burbank, California, which he has also claimed as his primary residence as recently as 2023, during his campaign for Senate.\nSchiff's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the matter.\nThe director of the UFHFA sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in May citing alleged misconduct by Schiff.\nCOULD SENATOR ADAM SCHIFF REALLY GO TO JAIL OVER ALLEGED MORTGAGE FRAUD?\n\"Based on media reports, Mr. Adam B. Schiff has, in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, impacting payments from 2003-2019 for a Potomac, Maryland-based property,\" FHFA Director William Pulte wrote in the letter. \"As regulator of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks, we take very seriously allegations of mortgage fraud or other criminal activity. Such misconduct jeopardizes the safety and soundness of FHFA\u2019s regulated entities and the security and stability of the U.S. mortgage market.\"\nPulte later received a memo from the Fannie Mae financial crimes investigations concluding that Schiff allegedly engaged in \"a sustained pattern of possible occupancy misrepresentation\" on five Fannie Mae loans, Fox News has learned.\nSchiff and his wife purchased a home in Potomac, Maryland, in 2003 for $870,000, according to the letter. They entered into a Fannie Mae-backed mortgage agreement for $610,000 at a rate of 5.625% over a term of 30 years, asserting the property would be their primary and principal residence.\nThe letter said they reaffirmed that the Maryland home was their primary residence in mortgage refinancing filings in 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013, despite Schiff being an elected official representing the state of California at the same time.\nFox News obtained a copy of the 2011 affidavit showing Schiff signed certifying that the Maryland house is his primary residence.\nPulte said Schiff and his wife did not list the Maryland home as their secondary residence until 2020.\nOver the same time frame, Schiff took a homeowner\u2019s tax exemption on a condo that he owns in Burbank, California, also claiming that home as his primary residence for a $7,000 reduction off of the 1% property tax, Pulte wrote, citing media reports.\nIn 2023, the letter notes, a spokesperson for Schiff asserted that, \"Adam\u2019s primary residence is Burbank, California, and will remain so when he wins the Senate seat.\"\nThe federal housing official wrote that he believes Schiff's alleged misconduct could be violations of federal criminal codes banning wire fraud, mail fraud, bank fraud and false statements to financial institutions.\nSchiff \"appears to have falsified records in order to receive favorable loan terms, and also appears to have been aware of the financial benefits of a primary residence mortgage when compared to a secondary residence mortgage,\" Pulte wrote.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAccording to the letter, a spokesperson for Schiff in 2023 told CNN that, \"Adam\u2019s California and Maryland addresses have been listed as primary residences for loan purposes because they are both occupied throughout the year and to distinguish them from a vacation property.\"\nLast year, the letter notes, a federal jury convicted Marilyn Mosby of making false statements on a mortgage application for a Florida condominium when she was the Baltimore City state\u2019s attorney.\nFox News Digital's Danielle Wallace contributed to this report."
