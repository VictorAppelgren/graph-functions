  "description": "Ransoms have surged as Haiti struggles with widespread gang violence, particularly around its capital Port-au-Prince.",
  "content": "Ransoms have surged as Haiti struggles with widespread gang violence, particularly around its capital Port-au-Prince.\n\nEight people, including an Irish missionary and a three-year-old child, have been released following a kidnapping at an orphanage in Haiti.\n\nThe announcement on Friday ended nearly a month of captivity for the group, which included Irish missionary Gena Heraty, the director of a special needs programme for children and adults at the Saint-Helene orphanage.\n\n\u201cWe warmly welcome the news that Gena and all of the Haitian nationals taken captive on [August 3], including a small child, have been released and are reported to be safe and well,\u201d Ireland\u2019s Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Harris said in a statement posted on X.\n\nKidnappings and ransoms have become increasingly common in Haiti, where gang violence has surged amid overlapping political, humanitarian and security crises.\n\nThe targeted orphanage was located in the southeast of the capital, Port-au-Prince, where the United Nations estimates gangs control nearly 90 percent of the territory.\n\nRun by the international charity Nos Petits Freres et Soeurs, the orphanage cares for more than 240 children, according to its website.\n\nFurther details of the release were not immediately available. No group claimed responsibility for the attack on the school in early August, although the area is controlled by the Viv Ansanm gang federation.\n\nIn a statement, Heraty\u2019s family said they were \u201crelieved beyond words\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe continue to hold Haiti in our hearts and hope for peace and safety for all those who are affected by the ongoing armed violence and insecurity there,\u201d they wrote.\n\nIn April 2021, two French priests were among 10 people kidnapped by the \u201c400 Mawozo\u201d gang before they were released nearly three weeks later.\n\nThe gang took 17 American and Canadian missionaries hostage from a bus six months later.\n\nFriday\u2019s release came as the UN Security Council began talks to bolster a floundering international police force deployed to Haiti starting in June 2024 to counter the rising violence.\n\nJust under 1,000 personnel, mostly Kenyan, are currently in the country as part of the US-backed mission, a number far below the 2,500 troops originally expected.\n\nA draft proposal, put forth by the US and Panama this week, seeks to transition the mission into a so-called \u201cGang Suppression Force\u201d.\n\nThe proposal would authorise a deployment of up to 5,500 personnel and establish a UN office in Port-au-Prince to provide \u201cfull logistical support\u201d for rations, fuel, medical services, ground transportation and surveillance from drones.\n\nIt further laid out a plan to encourage more voluntary funding and resources, but the draft did not directly address the current mission\u2019s lagging support. Earlier this month, the UN said its effort to bring stability to Haiti was less than 10 percent funded.\n\nUN missions remain controversial in Haiti, with past deployments resulting in a sexual abuse scandal and cholera epidemic that killed more than 9,000 people.\n\nStill, the country\u2019s leaders have requested external help as violence and displacement have surged.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has said at least 3,141 people have been killed in Haiti in the first half of this year.\n\nOn Thursday, the head of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) reported that a \u201cstaggering\u201d 50 percent of gang members and participants in the country were children.",

      "text": "400 Mawozo gang kidnapped the missionaries: Haiti police\nGang known as 400 Mazowo said to have abducted 17 foreign missionaries amid increasing lawlessness in troubled nation.\nA notorious Haitian gang known for brazen kidnappings and killings has been accused by police of kidnapping 17 Christian missionaries, including five children, from a US-based organisation.\nThe 400 Mawozo gang snatched the group in Ganthier, east of the capital of Port-au-Prince, Haitian police inspector Frantz Champagne told The Associated Press (AP) news agency on Sunday.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 4 itemsDeportations making Haiti crisis worse, says former US envoy\nWidow of slain Haitian president \u2018won\u2019t stop\u2019 push for justice\nHaiti top diplomat asks UN Security Council for help with gangs\nThe gang, whose name roughly translates to 400 \u201cinexperienced men,\u201d controls the Croix-des-Bouquets area that includes Ganthier, where they carry out kidnappings and carjackings and extort business owners, according to authorities.\nOhio-based Christian Aid Ministries said the kidnapped group consisted of 16 US citizens and one Canadian national and included seven women and five men as well as the children. They were in a bus on their way to visit an orphanage when they were abducted, it added.\n\u201cWe are seeking God\u2019s direction for a resolution, and authorities are seeking ways to help,\u201d the organisation said in a statement.\nHaiti has seen a spike in kidnappings following the killing of President Jovenel Moise in July as armed gangs take advantage of spreading insecurity and a political crisis aggravated by Moise\u2019s assassination.\n\u201cThis kind of climate gives opportunities for anyone to do whatever they want because it\u2019s easy now,\u201d Emmanuela Douyon, founder and executive director of Policite, a think tank, told Al Jazeera. \u201cThere\u2019s not much control. Anyone who has something against you can do something. The risks are higher now than they used to be.\u201d\nThose affected generally come from the Haitian middle class \u2013 teachers, priests, civil servants, small business owners \u2013 who can scrape together a ransom. Gangs have demanded ransoms ranging from a couple of hundred dollars to more than $1m, according to authorities.\nCivil society groups on Sunday called for the missionaries\u2019 immediate release. The youngest child is just two years old.\n\u201cWe call for the liberation of the persons kidnapped, whether American citizens or of other nationalities,\u201d Gedeon Jean, the director of the Center for Analysis and Research in Human Rights, based in the capital Port-au-Prince told the AFP news agency. He said the current situation was \u201cdetrimental to human dignity\u201d.\nThe US State Department said it was aware of the reports. US embassies do not typically release information about citizens due to privacy regulations. A senior US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP the United States was in touch with Haitian authorities to try and resolve the case.\nThe Canadian government said it was working with local authorities and groups to gather more information.\nVoid\nWhile attacks on foreigners are relatively rare, 400 Mawozo is suspected of being involved in the April kidnapping in the same area of a group of priests and nuns that included French citizens.\nAmong its activities in Haiti, Christian Aid Ministries runs a medical clinic, helps orphans and holds Bible readings.\nIts annual report for last year said that American staff had returned to their base in Haiti after a nine-month absence \u201cdue to political unrest\u201d and noted \u201cuncertainty and difficulties\u201d arising from such instability.\nA team from the AP on Sunday visited the group\u2019s orphanage in Ganthier, where a couple of children were seen walking through a yard. A security guard confirmed that it was the place the kidnapped missionaries visited before they were abducted. The guard called the orphanage\u2019s pastor at the AP\u2019s request, but he declined to comment, saying only, \u201cLet\u2019s leave things as they are.\u201d\nNearly a year ago, Haitian police issued a wanted poster for 400 Mawozo\u2019s alleged leader, Wilson Joseph, on charges including murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, car theft and the hijacking of trucks carrying goods. He goes by the nickname \u201cLanm\u00f2 Sanjou,\u201d which means \u201cdeath doesn\u2019t know which day it\u2019s coming\u201d.\nAt least 328 kidnappings were reported to Haiti\u2019s National Police in the first eight months of 2021, compared with a total of 234 for all of 2020, according to a report issued last month by the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti known as BINUH.\nAnalyst Jean said the absence of a strong state had left a void that criminal gangs have moved to fill, extending their hold from some of the capital\u2019s poorest districts into surrounding areas.\nThe kidnapping of the missionaries comes just days after senior US officials visited Haiti and promised more resources for Haiti\u2019s National Police, including $15m to help reduce gang violence."

      "text": "United Nations says children make up 50 percent of gang members in Haiti\nUS and Panama have proposed a security force meant to counter gangs, despite setbacks with an existing Kenya-led policing operation.\nThe United Nations has reported that children now comprise about half of the membership of Haitian gangs, as violence and political and economic instability continue to roil the Caribbean nation.\nOn Thursday, the head of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), Catherine Russell, announced the \u201calarming\u201d statistics, as she and other officials pushed for more support in Haiti.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 itemsUN says bid to help address turmoil in Haiti less than 10 percent funded\nBlackwater founder Erik Prince to send forces to Haiti to fight gangs\n\u201cWe estimate that children currently account for a staggering 50 percent of the members of the armed groups active today,\u201d Russell said.\n\u201cChildren are being forced into combat roles, directly participating in armed confrontations. Others are being used as couriers, lookouts, porters to carry weapons or are exploited for domestic labour.\u201d\nShe added that the number of child recruits appears to be rapidly rising. Child participation in gang activities, including recruitment, had surged by 700 percent in the first three months of the year, compared with the same period last year.\nThat coincided with an increase in the number of human rights violations committed against children in Haiti.\nIn 2024, the UN reported more than 2,000 grave violations against minors, an increase of 500 percent from the previous year.\nCriminal organisations and gangs have grown increasingly powerful in Haiti, particularly in the aftermath of the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise.\nThe resulting violence has forced nearly 1.3 million Haitians to flee their homes, half of them estimated to be young people.\nThe UN has previously warned that gangs have gained \u201cnear-total control\u201d of the capital, Port-au-Prince, with as much as 90 percent of the city under their influence.\nThe result has been blocked roads, limited public services and skyrocketing costs for essential supplies, including food.\nHaitian gangs have long pointed to political corruption as a reason for seeking increased power and territorial control. But human rights abuses have been growing: From October to June alone, nearly 5,000 people were killed as a result of gang violence.\nBoth the Haitian government and the international community have struggled to address the widespread bloodshed.\nIn October 2023, the UN Security Council approved a Kenya-led mission to support Haiti\u2019s police, but those forces have struggled to make an impact and have suffered from lack of funding and resources.\nCritics have also feared the prospect of foreign intervention, given the country\u2019s disastrous history with colonial and military occupation.\nAt a UN Security Council meeting on Thursday, United States Ambassador Dorothy Shea said her country and Panama would put forward a draft resolution to establish a security force aimed at confronting the gangs.\nIt is unclear how that force would intersect with the existing UN-backed security force.\nBut the Haitian government has recently sought greater collaboration with private security firms such as Vectus Global, run by the private military entrepreneur Erik Prince, who has ties to US President Donald Trump.\nThe UN reported in August that a proposed response plan to address the crisis in Haiti had received less than 10 percent of its funding goal.\nDespite the severity of the violence roiling Haiti, migrants and refugees fleeing the turmoil have struggled to find safety in other countries.\nThe US announced in June that it would move to revoke protections for Haitians living in the country, opening them up to the possibility of deportation."

      "text": "\u2018Nowhere near winning this,\u2019 Haiti\u2019s PM says of battle against gangs\nPrime Minister Garry Conille offers grim view of progress in anti-gang mission on sidelines of UN General Assembly.\nHaiti\u2019s interim prime minister has said the Caribbean country is far from defeating armed groups that have seized control of large swaths of territory, urging greater international support to help restore safety and stability.\n\u201cWe are nowhere near winning this, and the simple reality is that we won\u2019t without your help,\u201d Garry Conille said on Wednesday at an event on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 items24 people killed, 40 injured in Haiti tanker truck explosion\nHaiti sets up council to prepare for first elections since 2016\n\u201cThere is a sense of urgency because the Haitian people are watching with cautious optimism, they\u2019re really hoping to see clear results,\u201d he said.\nHaiti has reeled from years of violence as powerful armed groups \u2013 often with ties to the country\u2019s political and business leaders \u2013 have vied for influence and control of territory.\nBut the situation worsened dramatically at the end of February, when the gangs launched attacks on prisons and other state institutions across the capital of Port-au-Prince.\nThe surge in violence prompted the resignation of Haiti\u2019s unelected prime minister, the creation of the transitional presidential council, and the deployment of a UN-backed, multinational police deployment led by Kenya.\nAbout 10 countries have pledged more than 3,100 troops to the multinational force \u2013 formally known as the Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) \u2013 but only approximately 400 of these have deployed.\nThe mission\u2019s one-year mandate expires in early October and the UN Security Council is set to vote on September 30 on whether to renew it.\nOn Wednesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed that the funding for the mission, as well as the Haitian National Police, \u201cremains totally inadequate\u201d.\n\u201cI urge all those who have made financial commitments to deliver on them urgently,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe must keep working to mobilize sufficient resources for the mission, and for the humanitarian response in Haiti.\u201d\nMore than 700,000 Haitians have been displaced due to the violence and instability, according to UN figures, with many living in makeshift camps in Port-au-Prince. The instability also has pushed many Haitians to flee the country in search of protection.\nMeanwhile, the United States, the MSS\u2019s key backer, has been pushing to get more funding and personnel to bolster the force.\nThe US State Department announced on Wednesday that it was contributing an additional $160m in \u201cdevelopment, economic, health, and security assistance for the Haitian people\u201d.\nNews outlets also have reported that Washington is exploring the possibility of transitioning the mission into a UN peacekeeping operation.\n.@SecBlinken spoke with @UN Secretary-General Guterres about the possibility of transforming the Haiti Multinational Security Support mission into a UN peacekeeping mission. They discussed the need for sustainable security support for the Haitian people.\n\u2014 Matthew Miller (@StateDeptSpox) September 19, 2024\nThat potential change received the backing of Kenyan President William Ruto, who visited Haiti at the weekend to assess the progress of the Kenya-led mission.\n\u201cOn the suggestion to transit this into a fully UN peacekeeping mission, we have absolutely no problem with it, if that is the direction the UN Security Council wants to take,\u201d Ruto said on Saturday in Port-au-Prince.\nBut many Haitians remain wary of UN interventions, saying past deployments have brought more harm than good.\nA deadly 2010 cholera outbreak was linked to a UN peacekeeping base, for example, and UN forces in Haiti were also accused of rape and sexual abuse.\nHaitian civil society leaders have cautiously welcomed the multinational mission as a needed boost in the fight against the gangs. But they have also stressed that the problems facing the country will not be solved by force alone.\nThey have called for more support and training for Haiti\u2019s national police force, as well as an end to corruption and a Haitian-led political process."

      "text": "Haiti names new head of transitional council ahead of scheduled elections\nLaurent Saint-Cyr is meant to be the final head of the council as it prepares for a nationwide vote to elect a president.\nHaiti has appointed businessman Laurent Saint-Cyr as the head of its transitional presidential council as the country continues to battle rampant gang violence, corruption and economic insecurity.\nSaint-Cyr\u2019s inauguration ceremony took place on Thursday at the Villa d\u2019Accueil, a colonial-style mansion in a suburb of the capital, Port-au-Prince.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 itemsColombia\u2019s Petro visits Haiti to help bolster security amid gang violence\nUS to deport Haitian legal permanent residents with alleged gang ties\n\u201cWe must restore state authority,\u201d Saint-Cyr said at the ceremony. \u201cThe challenges we face are certainly linked to insecurity, but they also are the result of our lack of courage, a lack of vision and our irresponsibility.\u201d\nBut even the location of Saint-Cyr\u2019s inauguration was a sign of the instability Haiti faced. The federal government has been largely displaced from downtown Port-au-Prince, where gangs control nearly 90 percent of the city.\nOn Thursday morning, one prominent gang leader, Jimmy \u201cBarbecue\u201d Cherizier, even pledged to disrupt Saint-Cyr\u2019s inauguration.\n\u201cWe have decided to march on the premier\u2019s office and the Villa d\u2019Accueil to end it all,\u201d Cherizier said in a video posted online.\nHe called on Port-au-Prince\u2019s residents to assist him and his fighters in their approach of the mansion: \u201cPeople of Haiti, take care of yourselves and help us.\u201d\nBut Cherizier was ultimately not successful. A security mission backed by the United Nations and led by Kenya issued a statement explaining that police officers had increased their patrols in the area.\n\u201cArmed gangs had plotted to disrupt national stability and render the country ungovernable,\u201d the statement said, asserting that law enforcement had successfully deterred those efforts.\nSaint-Cyr\u2019s appointment, however, has drawn scrutiny for what it symbolises in the conflict-torn country.\nBoth Saint-Cyr and Haiti\u2019s prime minister, Alix-Didier Fils-Aime, are light-skinned, mixed-race businessmen who made their fortunes in the private sector. Saint-Cyr worked in the insurance industry, while Fils-Aime led an internet company.\nThe majority of Haitians, however, are Black, with only 5 percent of the population identifying as mixed race. The country itself is the poorest in Latin America.\nSome critics fear the leadership of figures like Saint-Cyr could herald a slide backwards for Haiti\u2019s government, where power has long been concentrated among the rich and lighter-skinned.\nThe country has not held a presidential election since 2016, and turmoil in the country increased following the 2021 assassination of Jovenel Moise.\nCriminal networks have exploited the power vacuum to expand their own influence, while denouncing the remaining government leadership as inefficient and corrupt.\nThough the presidential council was only formed in April 2024, by the end of that year, three of its members had been accused of corruption, though they denied wrongdoing.\nThe transitional presidential council is considered to be widely unpopular, and its nine members have been rotating into the leadership position.\nSaint-Cyr is meant to be the final head of the council before it completes its task of holding a presidential election on February 7, 2026. At that point, Saint-Cyr and the council are expected to hand off power to the election\u2019s victor.\nElections for roles in the federal government are expected to unfold in three stages, starting in November and ending with February\u2019s presidential race. But critics warn gang violence could thwart those plans.\nThe United Nations estimates that 4,864 people in Haiti were killed from October 2024 to June of this year.\nThreats of violence have forced essential services to shut down, including hospitals and roadways, and nearly 1.3 million people have been displaced from their homes.\nThe humanitarian situation in Haiti is considered among the most dire in the world, and Saint-Cyr called on the international community to respond with further resources.\n\u201cI invite all international partners to increase their support, send more soldiers, provide more training,\u201d Saint-Cyr said at Thursday\u2019s ceremony. \u201cI am asking the security forces to intensify their operations.\u201d\nAmbassadors from several foreign countries were in attendance. He directed some of his remarks at them.\n\u201cOur country is going through one of the greatest crises in all its history,\u201d Saint-Cyr said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the time for beautiful speeches. It\u2019s time to act.\u201d"

      "text": "Haiti declares three-month state of emergency as gang violence spikes\nGovernment says move aims to boost \u2018fight against insecurity\u2019 as armed gangs continue to carry out attacks across the country.\nHaiti\u2019s government has announced a three-month state of emergency in several parts of the country as it battles surging gang violence.\nThe measure will cover the West, Centre and Artibonite departments, the latter of which is known as Haiti\u2019s \u201crice basket\u201d and has experienced an increase in attacks by armed groups in recent months.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 itemsUS to deport Haitian legal permanent residents with alleged gang ties\nHaiti death toll hits nearly 5,000 in nine months as gang violence spreads\nIn a statement on Saturday, the government said the state of emergency would allow the Haitian authorities to \u201ccontinue the fight against insecurity and respond to the agricultural and food crisis\u201d.\n\u201cInsecurity has negative effect both on the lives of citizens and on the country\u2019s different sectors of activity. Given the scale of this crisis, it is imperative to decree a major mobilisation of the state\u2019s resources and institutional means to address it,\u201d it said.\nHaiti has reeled from years of violence as powerful armed groups, often with ties to the country\u2019s political and business leaders, have vied for influence and control of territory.\nBut the situation worsened dramatically after the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise, which created a power vacuum.\nNearly 1.3 million people have been displaced across the country, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said in June, while the United Nations estimates that 4,864 people were killed from October 2024 to June of this year.\nEfforts to stem the deadly gang attacks, including the deployment of a UN-backed, Kenya-led police mission, have so far failed to restore stability.\nWhile much of the focus has been on Haiti\u2019s capital, Port-au-Prince, where up to 90 percent of the city is under the control of armed groups, the violence has also been spreading to other parts of the country.\nBetween October 2024 and the end of June, more than 1,000 Haitians were killed and 620 were kidnapped in the Artibonite and Centre departments, according to the UN\u2019s human rights office.\nIn late April, dozens of people waded and swam across the Artibonite River, which cuts through the region, in a desperate attempt to flee the gangs.\nMeanwhile, the government on Friday appointed Andre Jonas Vladimir Paraison as interim director of Haiti\u2019s National Police, which has been working with Kenyan police officers leading the UN-backed mission to help quell the violence.\n\u201cWe, the police, will not sleep,\u201d Paraison said during his inauguration ceremony. \u201cWe will provide security across every corner of the country.\u201d\nParaison previously served as head of security of Haiti\u2019s National Palace and was on duty as a police officer when Moise was killed at his private residence in July 2021.\nHe replaced Normil Rameau, whose tenure of just more than a year was marked by tensions with a faction of the Transitional Presidential Council, notably Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime.\nRameau had repeatedly warned about the police force\u2019s severe underfunding.\nThe change comes as Laurent Saint-Cyr, a wealthy businessman, also took over this week as president of the Transitional Presidential Council, which is charged with holding elections by February 2026."

      "text": "Kenyan police contingent arrives in Haiti as protests roil Nairobi\nHundreds of officers travelled to Haiti to begin a UN-backed mission to curtail the influence of the country\u2019s gangs.\nA group of Kenyan police officers have arrived in Haiti, marking the beginning of a United Nations-backed mission to combat powerful armed gangs that have wreaked turmoil in the Caribbean country.\nWaving Kenyan flags and sporting camouflage uniforms and rifles, several hundred Kenyan police officers stepped onto the tarmac at the Toussaint Louverture international airport on Tuesday near the capital of Port-au-Prince. More than 80 percent of the city has fallen under the control of gangs.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 itemsKenyan police to depart for contentious peacekeeping effort in Haiti\nHaiti to replace national police chief in effort to counter gang violence\n\u201cI commend \u2014 and am deeply grateful to \u2014 all the countries that have pledged personnel and financial support to this mission,\u201d United States President Joe Biden said in a statement on Tuesday, noting that the US also provided $360m in support.\nWhile the UN has urged the international community to send a security force to Haiti, a long and controversial history of foreign interventions has caused critics to question the initiative.\nThose doubts have been exacerbated by a lack of concrete details regarding the goals and actions of the latest mission.\n\u201cWhat is going to happen vis-a-vis the gangs?\u201d said Romain Le Cour Grandmaison, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime. \u201cIs it a static mission? Is it a moving mission? All those details are still missing, and I think it\u2019s about time that there\u2019s actually transparency.\u201d\nHaitian Prime Minister Garry Conille, however, praised the effort in remarks earlier on Tuesday.\n\u201cThe country is going through very difficult times,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start working little by little to retake the country.\u201d\nConille was named to his post last month as part of a transitional government in Haiti. The country has not held federal elections since before the assassination of President Jovenal Moise in 2021.\nSpeaking alongside Conille was Monica Juma, a security adviser to Kenyan President William Ruto. Juma said in remarks that the forces will serve as \u201cagents of peace, of stability, of hope\u201d.\nHowever, on the day Kenyan forces arrived in Haiti, police in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi opened fire on protesters attempting to storm parliament, killing several demonstrators and injuring dozens more.\n\u201cThe police should be able to operate well in their own country, but they can\u2019t,\u201d said Enock Alumasi Makanga, an ex-Kenyan police officer now working in private security. \u201cHow do you think they can manage then when they arrive in Haiti?\u201d\nResponding to questions about the incident, Biden administration spokesperson Matthew Miller said that the US and other countries have \u201cvetted the Kenyan personnel\u201d in Haiti and underscored the importance of human rights.\nThe Kenyan police are the first contingent of an international force in Haiti that is anticipated to reach about 2,500 police from 15 other countries.\nA previous UN mission, which lasted from 2004 until 2017, did little to improve the conditions on the island. Instead, its presence was tarnished by allegations of sexual assault and the start of a cholera outbreak that killed an estimated 10,000 people.\nIn the intervening years, however, gangs have increased their influence, filling the power vacuum left by Haiti\u2019s government. So far this year, violence has displaced a record 578,074 people from their homes, and nearly half of the country\u2019s population is living with severe hunger."

      "text": "UN says bid to help address turmoil in Haiti less than 10 percent funded\nViolence remains widespread in Haiti, where powerful armed gangs have surged amid political and economic chaos.\nThe United Nations has said that efforts to address widespread economic and political dysfunction and debilitating violence in Haiti are falling far short, with a UN response plan receiving the lowest funding of any in the world.\nIn a briefing on Tuesday, coordinator Ulrika Richardson said that the UN hopes to raise more than $900m for Haiti this year, but that effort is just 9.2 percent funded.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 itemsHaiti names new head of transitional council ahead of scheduled elections\nHaiti death toll hits nearly 5,000 in nine months as gang violence spreads\n\u201cWe have tools, but the response from the international community is just not at par with the gravity on the ground,\u201d Richardson said.\nThe lacklustre funding numbers underscore concerns over flagging international efforts to assist the Caribbean island nation, which is reeling from violence as powerful armed gangs jostle for control of territory and resources amid political and economic instability.\nRichardson said that a $2.63bn appeal for Ukraine is 38 percent funded and that a $4bn appeal for the occupied Palestinian territories is 22 percent funded, by comparison.\nMore than 1.3 million people have been displaced by the violence in Haiti, and more than 3,100 people have been killed this year.\nArmed gangs, some with links to powerful political and economic figures, have taken control of large swathes of the capital of Port-au-Prince since the assassination of former president Jovenel Moise in July 2021.\nThe UN has said that cutting off the supply of arms pouring into the country, largely smuggled from the US state of Florida, is a key step towards staunching the violence, along with applying sanctions on networks connected to the gangs.\n\u201cHaiti can quickly spiral up again, but the violence needs to end,\u201d said Richardson.\nBut international efforts to address the fighting thus far have little to show, and some Haitians are sceptical of such efforts given a long history of destructive interventions by outside powers.\nA UN-backed policing mission, staffed largely by Kenyan security officers, has failed to bring stability to the country or tackle the gangs. Haiti\u2019s government also declared a three-month state of emergency earlier this month, covering the West, Centre and Artibonite departments of the country."
