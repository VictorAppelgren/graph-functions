      "title": "U.S. producer prices surge in July as Trump tariffs push costs higher",
      "summary": "U.S. wholesale inflation unexpectedly surged by 0.9% in July, the largest increase in over three years, largely attributed to President Trump's tariffs on imports. While producers have absorbed some costs, economists warn that these higher expenses will eventually be passed on to consumers, potentially leading to increased prices. The Federal Reserve faces challenges in its monetary policy decisions as inflation rates rise above its 2% target, complicating expectations for interest rate cuts.",
