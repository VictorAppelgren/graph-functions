  "title": "Trump says he will place tariffs on furniture \u2014 causing shares of Wayfair, Williams-Sonoma to plunge",
  "description": "\u201cThis will bring the Furniture Business back to North Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan, and States all across the Union,\u201d Trump vowed.",
  "content": "President Trump announced Friday that his administration is investigating imported furniture for potential tariffs, sending shares of major home goods companies tumbling in after-hours trading.\n\nTrump said the probe would be wrapped up within 50 days, after which furniture imports would face duties at rates \u201cyet to be determined.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will bring the Furniture Business back to North Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan, and States all across the Union,\u201d Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.\n\nThe tariff threat hammered stocks of companies heavily reliant on foreign manufacturing. Wayfair, RH and Williams-Sonoma all saw their shares plunge following Trump\u2019s announcement.\n\nWayfair, whose stock fell by more than 6% after the closing bell on Friday, imports much of its furniture inventory from overseas suppliers.\n\nShares of RH were also down more than 6% while Williams-Sonoma stock dropped more than 4% Friday evening.\n\nHowever, not all furniture companies suffered. La-Z-Boy shares actually rose nearly 2.5% on the news since the company conducts most of its manufacturing operations within the United States.\n\nThe furniture industry investigation adds to Trump\u2019s growing list of sectoral tariff targets.\n\nHe has already imposed steep duties on automobiles, steel and aluminum while floating similar measures for copper, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement left unclear whether furniture tariffs would stack on top of existing country-specific duty rates that Trump has negotiated through bilateral trade deals.\n\nThe Trump administration has spent months conducting trade negotiations with partners worldwide, seeking to rebalance what it views as unfair global commerce arrangements.\n\nRecent framework agreements with the European Union and China have provided some market stability, though many longer-term trade disputes remain unresolved.\n\nThe timing of potential furniture tariffs comes as the industry faces significant headwinds.\n\nCompanies like Wayfair have endured more than a year of declining demand for big-ticket items, including couches and dining room sets.\n\nThe furniture sales slump stems partly from a sluggish housing market as prospective buyers wait for interest rates to decline before making major purchases.\n\nFewer new home sales translate directly into reduced furniture demand, since consumers typically buy new furnishings when they move into different residences.\n\nPersistent inflation has also made consumers more selective about discretionary spending. Restaurants, clothing, travel and home decor have all experienced reduced sales as shoppers tighten their budgets.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariff strategy aims to encourage companies to relocate manufacturing operations back to the United States, particularly in states with strong furniture-making traditions.\n\nNorth Carolina and other southeastern states historically served as major furniture production hubs before much of the industry migrated overseas in search of lower labor costs.\n\nThe investigation represents another step in Trump\u2019s broader trade agenda focused on reducing America\u2019s reliance on foreign manufacturing across multiple industries.\n\nPrevious tariff announcements have produced mixed results, with some companies announcing plans to reshore production while others have absorbed higher costs or passed them on to consumers.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from the American Home Furnishings Alliance.",

      "text": "Sales of new US single-family homes fell more than expected in May as high mortgage rates sapped demand, boosting the supply of unsold houses on the market.\nNew home sales units dropped 13.7% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 623,000 units last month, the Commerce Department\u2019s Census Bureau said on Wednesday.\nThe sales pace for April was revised lower to a rate of 722,000 units from the previously reported 743,000 units.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which make up about 15% of US home sales, declining to a rate of 693,000 units.\nNew home sales, which are counted at the signing of a contract, are volatile on a month-to-month basis and subject to big revisions.\nThey decreased 6.3% on a year-on-year basis in May.\nThe inventory of unsold homes on the market increased to 507,000 units, the highest level since late 2007, from 500,000 in April.\nMortgage rates have remained elevated in tandem with US Treasury yields amid heightened economic uncertainty stemming from President Trump\u2019s tariffs, which have prompted the Federal Reserve to pause its interest rate cutting cycle.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday that the sweeping import duties could begin raising inflation this summer and reiterated that the US central bank was in no rush to resume rate cuts.\nThe Fed last week left its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range where it has been since December.\nThe average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage hovered just under 7% in May, data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac showed.\nGovernment data last week showed permits for future construction of single-family housing dropped to a two-year low in May as builders struggled with the inventory overhang and higher costs from duties on materials, including lumber, steel and aluminum.\nA National Association of Home Builders survey last week also showed sentiment among single-family homebuilders plummeted to a 2-1/2-year low in June.\nThe NAHB reported a rise in the share of builders cutting prices to reduce the inventory bulge, and forecast a drop in single-family housing starts this year.\nEconomists expect residential investment, which includes homebuilding and sales, to have contracted in the second quarter after a slight decline in the January-March quarter."

      "text": "Trump strikes \u2018biggest deal ever made\u2019 with EU: Europeans will buy $750B in US energy, invest $600B after meeting with prez\nIt took just 75 minutes for President Trump to get what he wanted out of the European Union.\nThat\u2019s how long he and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were away from the cameras.\nWhen they returned, Trump was triumphant. Europe agreed to buy $750 billion in American energy products, invest $600 billion in new money in the US and purchase additional US military equipment, according to the terms of the preliminary agreement.\nTariffs on many American exports will drop to zero. Duties on most European goods coming into the US rise to 15%.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the biggest deal ever made,\u201d Trump proclaimed.\nThe stated terms of the tariff deal appeared to be remarkably lopsided in favor of the US. Von der Leyen suggested that the only real concession from the Americans was that Trump would not impose 30% tariffs he had threatened.\nThe 27-member bloc is America\u2019s biggest trading partner if taken together, with total trade hitting $1.97 trillion last year. The US trade deficit for goods was $235 billion.\nThe deal avoids a trade war between two economies that account for about 44% of the world\u2019s gross domestic product \u2014 less than a week before steep \u201cLiberation Day\u201d levies were set to bite.\n\u201cI think we both wanted to make a deal,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to bring us closer together. I think this deal will bring us very close together.\u201d\nBefore announcing the agreement, both Trump and von der Leyen put the odds at making a deal at 50-50. The European leader had flown to Scotland to meet Trump at his Turnberry golf course, where the president spent the morning playing with son Eric.\n\u201cThe starting point was an imbalance \u2014 a surplus on our side and a deficit on the US side,\u201d the EU boss said when asked about the concessions Trump made. \u201cAnd we wanted to rebalance the trade relation, and we wanted to do it in a way that trade goes on between the two of us across the Atlantic.\u201d\nThe sides also agreed to have zero-for-zero tariff rates on \u201ca number of strategic products\u201d such as aircraft and component parts, certain chemicals, certain generics, semiconductor equipment, specific agriculture products, natural resources and critical raw materials, according to von der Leyen.\nPart of the arrangement also involved a European agreement to \u201cpurchase a vast amount of military equipment\u201d from the US, though Trump noted, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what that number is\u201d yet.\nVon der Leyen and Trump shook hands and commended each other on the deal.\nEuropean negotiators had sought to score a 10% tariff from the US, mirroring Trump\u2019s baseline rate against foreign countries and the preliminary trade deal he inked with the United Kingdom in May.\nOne of the goals for Europe was to bring down US tariffs on automobile exports. Trump imposed a 27.5% rate on autos in April. The president predicted that American auto manufacturers and farmers would be among the happiest constituencies with the deal.\n\u201cI think maybe cars would be the one that would go the biggest, and the second would be agriculture, the farmers,\u201d he said.\nBefore announcing the deal, Trump signaled that \u201cpharmaceuticals won\u2019t be part\u201d of the deal he was negotiating because his administration is planning a more aggressive approach to reshore manufacturing in that sector. Pharmaceuticals are Europe\u2019s largest export to the US. Trump threatened 200% tariffs on those products last month.\nTrump also clarified that his steel and aluminum tariff policy is \u201cstaying the way it is,\u201d meaning it would remain at the 50% worldwide rate that he announced in June.\nThe EU boss signaled plans to have a quota system on steel and aluminum, but didn\u2019t elaborate.\nVon der Leyen hailed Trump as a \u201ctough negotiator and dealmaker.\u201d\n\u201cAnd fair,\u201d Trump interjected.\nThe EU boss also characterized negotiations with the US president as \u201cvery difficult\u201d and acknowledged the visible tension between the two before they reached the agreement.\nRepublican lawmakers back home quickly heralded Trump\u2019s deal with the Europeans as a significant victory.\n\u201cAnother historic trade deal, another big win for America. President Trump is winning nonstop!\u201d Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa) cheered.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who was part of Trump\u2019s delegation, billed the deal as a significant breakthrough.\n\u201cPresident Trump just unlocked one of the biggest economies in the world,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe European Union is going to open its [$]20 Trillion dollar market and completely accept our auto and industrial standards for the first time ever.\u201d\nStephen Miran, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, wagged his finger at traditional economists who doubted Trump could pull off 15% tariffs on the EU without significant retaliation.\n\u201cWrong. You owe an apology to [the president]. Another huge failure for elite consensus,\u201d he posted on X.\nRep. Michael Rulli (R-Ohio) hailed the preliminary trade deal as a \u201cboost to the Ohio Valley economy.\u201d\n\u201cWith $750 billion in U.S. energy exports heading to Europe by 2028, our region stands to benefit directly from the new demand for American oil, natural gas, and coal,\u201d Rulli told The Post.\n\u201cWith the elimination of EU tariffs on U.S. industrial goods, the deal opens new markets for our producers, expands production, and cuts bureaucratic red tape, enabling businesses across the Ohio Valley to export and compete on a global scale,\u201d he added. \u201cThis agreement unapologetically puts America First.\u201d\nTrump emphasized during his gaggle with reporters Sunday that he has no intention of delaying the Aug. 1 deadline before his customized \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs take effect. The president previously moved that deadline twice.\nSo far, Trump has cut preliminary tariff deals with the UK, Vietnam, Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines. The president teased that his team recently locked down another deal, but didn\u2019t specify which country.\nHe also has a variety of tariffs in place now, such as a 25% rate on automobiles, aluminum and steel, as well as 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico that don\u2019t comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He\u2019s also recently mused about jacking up tariffs on the US\u2019 two neighbors.\nTrump has also reached a tariff truce with China and given Beijing an Aug. 12 deadline to cut a broader deal.\nEarlier this month, he gave Moscow an ultimatum to cut a peace deal with neighboring Ukraine within 50 days or face 100% secondary tariffs on Russian energy \u2014 meaning levies imposed on countries that import from Russia."

Hence, the elimination of the \u2018old-timer\u2019 from the signage.\u201d\nSteak \u2018n Shake continued, \u201cHeritage is what got Cracker Barrel this far, and now the CEO wants to just scrape it all away. At Steak \u2018n Shake, we take pride in our history, our families, and American values. All are welcome. We will never market ourselves away from our past in a cheap effort to gain the approval of trend seekers.\u201d\nThe fiery post followed just one day after Steak \u2018n Shake called out Cracker Barrel on Wednesday for the logo change.\nReplying to a post from Trump advisor Alex Bruesewitz in which he criticized the chain\u2019s leadership for the new logo, Steak \u2018n Shake accused Cracker Barrel\u2019s board of directors of not respecting its \u201chistorical customers\u201d or \u201cbrand.\u201d\n\u201cAt Steak \u2018n Shake, we have gone back to basics,\u201d Steak \u2018n Shake posted to X on Wednesday.\n\u201cOur tallow fries are waiting for you.

Steak \u2018n Shake was founded in 1934 in Normal, Illinois, while Cracker Barrel opened its first store in 1969 in Lebanon, Tennessee, according to their websites.\nSteak \u2018n Shake and Cracker Barrel did not immediately respond to FOX Business\u2019 request for comment."

      "text": "Home Depot warns it may raise prices because of Trump\u2019s tariffs\nHome Depot warned that it may raise prices on select merchandise in order to offset the cost of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on imports \u2014 marking a reversal from the retailer\u2019s earlier stance against trade-related pricing adjustments.\nThe nation\u2019s largest home improvement chain said during an earnings call on Tuesday that pricing changes would affect specific product categories, though executives characterized the adjustments as measured rather than sweeping.\nRichard McPhail, Home Depot\u2019s chief financial officer, told the Wall Street Journal that certain items would see price modifications in response to import duties.\n\u201cThere will be some modest price movement for some categories,\u201d McPhail told the Journal, signaling the company\u2019s evolving approach to managing tariff pressures.\nThe likely price hikes come as customers pull back on home renovations.\nEconomic headwinds and elevated interest rates have prompted many homeowners to delay substantial remodeling projects, opting instead for minor improvements that don\u2019t require financing, according to Home Depot executives.\nThe Atlanta-based company reported that roughly half its merchandise originates from domestic suppliers, shielding those products from international trade duties \u2014 though imported goods remain vulnerable to cost increases.\nThe retailer\u2019s latest quarterly performance reflected mixed consumer behavior patterns.\nWhile comparable store sales edged up 1%, the number of customer visits declined by 0.9%.\nThis divergence suggests shoppers are spending more per trip while making fewer overall purchases. Wall Street responded favorably to the earnings report, pushing Home Depot shares higher by more than 4% during Tuesday trading.\nHome Depot CEO Ted Decker said mortgage rate relief could spur renewed customer activity.\n\u201cSome relief on mortgage rates in particular could help,\u201d Decker told analysts during the earnings call on Tuesday.\nThe residential real estate market\u2019s persistent challenges have weighed on Home Depot\u2019s performance in recent periods.\nElevated property values combined with economic uncertainty have dampened home sales activity, reducing demand for renovations typically done before listing properties or after purchasing new homes.\nAdditionally, costly financing has discouraged homeowners from pursuing major improvement projects requiring loans.\nDespite home equity values doubling since 2019, property owners are tapping into that wealth at historically low rates, suggesting widespread reluctance to take on debt even when collateral values support borrowing, according to McPhail.\nMeanwhile, inflation has dampened foot traffic to the store, according to research firm Placer.ai, which documented a 2.6% decline in Home Depot same-store visits during the second quarter compared to the previous year\u2019s period.\nTo counter softening do-it-yourself demand, Home Depot has intensified efforts to capture professional contractor business. The strategy includes expanded bulk purchasing options, customized ordering capabilities and enhanced support services tailored to commercial customers.\nThis professional market focus accelerated with Home Depot\u2019s recent agreement to purchase building materials supplier GMS for $4.3 billion.\nThe transaction follows last year\u2019s $18.25 billion acquisition of distribution firm SRS, reinforcing the company\u2019s commitment to serving professional builders.\nManagement projects the GMS acquisition will contribute positively to earnings within twelve months of completion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that more than 50% of our products are sourced domestically and not subject to tariffs,\u201d a Home Depot spokesperson told The Post.\n\u201cFor some imported goods, tariff rates are significantly higher than last quarter, so there will be modest price movement in certain categories, but it won\u2019t be broad based.\u201d\nThe company added that \u201cour customers shop with us for entire projects \u2014 not just a single item \u2014 so we\u2019re focused on protecting the overall cost of the project while maintaining the best value.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take a portfolio approach, as we always do, and intend to hold a price leadership position in home improvement,\u201d the company rep said.\n\u201cThis view is reflected in our reaffirmed guidance. In terms of categories, we don\u2019t break that out for competitive reasons.\u201d"

      "text": "Timing of Letitia James\u2019 Zelle suit backfiring as NY AG faces her own legal woes\nWall Street bankers are throwing shade on New York AG Tish James\u2019s sensational fraud accusations against the popular Zelle payments platform \u2013 claiming it looks like a cheap stunt to divert attention away from her own legal woes, On The Money has learned.\nOn Thursday, James was dealt a major blow when her own mortgage-fraud case against President Trump \u2013 and the nearly $500 million against him \u2013 was tossed by a New York appellate court skeptical of the evidence the AG presented in the case.\nThat\u2019s after she filed another lawsuit last week in New York State Supreme Court, essentially claiming that Zelle was plagued with scammers while its founders \u2013 big banks like JP Morgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo \u2013 stood idly by and allowed a billion dollars\u2019 worth of fraud to flourish under their collective noses.\nThe truth is more complicated, the bankers tell On The Money, and they may have a point. For starters, she filed her Zelle suit on Aug. 13 \u2013 just as a DOJ investigation was ramping up into whether James, seeking a better interest rate on a property she was buying in Virginia, misled bank officials about her residence.\n\u201cThe timing of this Zelle case is interesting,\u201d said one bank insider. \u201cSeems like James is looking to change the subject from her own problems.\u201d\nJames is alleged to have stated in 2023 bank documents her principal residence was Virginia not New York. James denies the charges. She has claimed they are politically motivated by her own mortgage fraud case against Trump.\nTrump, of course, claims that James\u2019s case against him lacked merit and was politically motivated, noting that she brought it after vowing during her NY AG campaign to bring charges against him, in violation of professional ethics.\nA press rep for the NY AG\u2019s office had no immediate comment on the appellate decision. As for the Zelle case, a spokesman said: \u201cThe Office of the Attorney General conducted a thorough investigation into Zelle\u2019s security failures that enabled massive amounts of fraud and we stand by our findings and our work to protect New Yorkers.\u201d\nZelle officials say they had no warning last week about the case being filed, which is standard procedure.\n\u201cThis lawsuit is a political stunt to generate press, not progress,\u201d a Zelle spokesperson told On The Money in a statement. \u201cThis is nothing more than a copycat of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau lawsuit that was dismissed in March. Despite the Attorney General\u2019s assertions, they did not conduct an investigation of Zelle.\u201d\nThe spokesman added, \u201cHad they conducted an investigation, they would have learned that more than 99.95 percent of all Zelle transactions are completed without any report of scam or fraud \u2013 which leads the industry.\u201d\nIndeed, the case is a leftover from the CFPB, the controversial federal agency that President Trump is looking to dismantle, and dropped after Trump took over because it looked pretty weak.\nThe vast majority of the ripoffs occurred between users operating on the platform by exchanging money, not people hacking into Zelle accounts and pilfering funds or Zelle employees doing something nefarious.\nThe typical so-called fraud involved someone looking to buy concert tickets or even puppies, and making a Zelle transfer of cash to someone else who took the money and ran.\nFor the record I\u2019m not defending this behavior, or saying Zelle should be open to bad actors. But based on James\u2019 allegations, what happened was a far cry from her sensationalized claim that Zelle is running a network \u201cteeming with fraudsters who have stolen staggering sums from consumers.\u201d"

      "text": "Canada scraps billions in tariffs on US imports as it extends olive branch to Trump\nPrime Minister Mark Carney is scrapping Canada\u2019s punishing tariffs on billions of dollars worth of American products in hopes of making trade peace with the Trump administration.\nCarney will announce the sweeping policy shift Friday after a cabinet meeting, removing 25% tariffs on a vast range of US consumer goods that comply with the North American trade agreement, Bloomberg News reported.\nThe move represents a stunning about-face for Canada, which had been one of the few countries to aggressively punch back against President Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist agenda.\nThe tariff rollback will spare American-made products like orange juice, wine, clothing and motorcycles from the steep import taxes that have been in place since March.\nThe relief applies to roughly $21.7 billion worth of US goods, sources in the know told Bloomberg News.\nBut Carney isn\u2019t completely backing down. Canada will maintain its 25% tariffs on US steel, aluminum and automobiles \u2014 sectors where Trump has imposed his own punitive levies.\nThe dramatic policy reversal comes just one day after Carney and Trump spoke by phone, marking their first publicly acknowledged conversation in weeks.\nSources say the move is designed to ease tensions with the White House while positioning Canada for the upcoming review of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement expected to begin in coming months.\nThe shift marks a sharp departure from the combative approach Carney championed during his successful election campaign, when he promised to inflict \u201cmaximum pain\u201d on the US through aggressive retaliation.\nThat tough-guy rhetoric helped propel Carney to victory over former Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative Party leader, in the recent election.\nTrudeau\u2019s government first imposed the retaliatory measures in March, targeting about $21.6 billion in US shipments. A second wave followed Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs, hitting US metals products and consumer goods worth another $21.6 billion annually.\nCarney escalated the trade war further during his campaign, slapping tariffs on US-manufactured vehicles in response to Trump\u2019s automotive levies.\nBut as prime minister, Carney has taken a markedly different approach than his predecessor, showing growing skepticism about the effectiveness of tit-for-tat trade measures.\nHis finance minister began carving out exemptions in April, allowing businesses to import certain US items tariff-free.\nAutomakers like General Motors and Stellantis were offered potential relief by Ottawa if they maintained Canadian manufacturing and investment.\nWhen Trump doubled steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%, Carney threatened retaliation but never followed through.\nCanada also declined to respond when the White House hiked its \u201cfentanyl tariffs\u201d on Canadian goods to 35% from 25% on Aug. 1.\nThe restrained response reflects economic realities that may have influenced Carney\u2019s calculation.\nBank of Nova Scotia economists estimate the effective US tariff rate on Canadian goods remains below 7%, thanks partly to USMCA exemptions that shield many Canadian exports.\nMeanwhile, Canada\u2019s retaliatory tariffs haven\u2019t triggered the inflation surge some economists feared.\nStatistics Canada, the government-run agency that crunches the numbers on economic data, reported consumer prices rose just 1.7% in July from a year earlier, well below the central bank\u2019s 2% target.\nThe policy reversal has irritated both Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who viewed Canada\u2019s swift retaliation as particularly galling compared to other trading partners\u2019 more measured responses.\n\u201cWe welcome this move by Canada, which is long overdue,\u201d a White House official told The Post. \u201cWe look forward to continuing our discussions with Canada on the Administration\u2019s trade and national security concerns.\u201d\nThe Post has sought comment from the Canadian government."

      "text": "Trump\u2019s Aug. 1 tariff deadline is set in stone, Lutnick says: \u2018No extensions, no more grace periods\u2019\nPresident Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs \u2014 set to kick in Friday \u2014 are set in stone this time and will not be delayed again, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday.\n\u201cNo extensions, no more grace periods. Aug. 1, the tariffs are set; they\u2019ll go into place. Customs will start collecting the money, and off we go,\u201d Lutnick said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\u201cObviously, after Aug. 1, people can still talk to President Trump. I mean, he\u2019s always willing to listen, and between now and then, I think the president is going to talk to a lot of people. Whether they can make him happy is another question.\u201d\nTrump announced a 10% baseline tariff rate on all imports to the US and announced a set of customs rates against virtually every country on the planet during his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d push.\nThe customized tariff rates were slated to take effect on April 9, but then got delayed 90 days and then postponed again until Aug. 1.\nIn the time since, Trump has announced preliminary trade deals with the United Kingdom, Vietnam, Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines.\nAdditionally, the Trump administration reached a tariff truce with China and set an Aug. 12 deadline to cut a broader deal.\nLutnick stressed that Trump is prioritizing the \u201cbig economies\u201d right now.\nThat includes the European Union. Trump met with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday during his four-day trip to the United Kingdom.\n\u201cWe set the table. The team sets the table. But Donald Trump does his negotiations by himself,\u201d he emphasized.\nThe EU is a bloc of 27 countries that, taken together, is one of America\u2019s largest sources of trade. Negotiations with the EU have proven to be lengthy and tricky for Trump.\nTrump has a variety of tariffs in place now, such as a 50% rate aluminum, and steel, as well as 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico that don\u2019t comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He\u2019s also recently mused about jacking up tariffs on Canada and Mexico.\nLutnick touted the revenue gains from those tariffs.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen is very few products are actually going to move in price,\u201d he predicted. \u201cAnd basically $700 billion, $800 billion, maybe it\u2019s possible we get near a trillion dollars of revenue, will come into the United States of America, reducing our deficit.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think is paying for no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, right?\u201d he added. \u201cI think if you take a look at the whole thing, it\u2019s going to be fantastic.\u201d\nTrump has also flexed tariffs in the geopolitical realm. On Saturday, he spoke with the leaders of Cambodia and Thailand, informing them that US trade negotiations will stop unless they cease fighting over a long-contested section of the border.\nOn July 15, the president also threatened Russia with 100% secondary tariffs on Russian oil if it fails to make a deal with neighboring Ukraine.\nThat threat could complicate US trade relations with China and India in particular, which have been taking advantage of cheap Russian oil due to the sanctions on Moscow."

      "text": "Trump threatens to escalate trade war with new round of tariffs up to 50%\nPresident Donald Trump said he will impose tariffs ranging from a minimum rate of 15% to a clip as high as 50% as his Aug. 1 deadline looms.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a straight, simple tariff of anywhere between 15% and 50%,\u201d Trump said Wednesday at an artificial intelligence summit in Washington, DC.\nTrump\u2019s latest tariff salvo was aimed at countries that have not yet secured bilateral trade frameworks with Washington.\nWhile some nations are actively negotiating to lower their rates, Trump emphasized that he intends to apply a \u201cvery, very simple tariff for some of the countries,\u201d citing the logistical challenge of negotiating individual deals with over 150 nations.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t negotiate deals with everyone,\u201d Trump said.\nHe added that negotiations with the European Union were \u201cserious\u201d and tied potential reductions in tariffs to increased access for American businesses.\n\u201cIf they agree to open up the (EU) to American businesses, then we will let them pay a lower tariff,\u201d Trump said.\nThe markets were mixed Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 164 points, or 0.36%, to 44,846.29 as of noon.\nThe S&P 500 rose 13.68 points, or 0.22%, to 6,372.59, while the Nasdaq gained 43.05 points, or 0.21%, to reach 21,063.06.\nTrump\u2019s comments mark a shift from statements when he initially proposed a universal tariff of 10% on nearly every country during his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d rollout in April.\nWhile his team has previously floated rates between 10% and 15%, Wednesday\u2019s remarks indicate that the baseline is now expected to begin at 15%, with significantly higher rates for countries with strained relations with the US.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that smaller nations \u2014 including \u201cthe Latin American countries, the Caribbean countries, many countries in Africa\u201d \u2014 would face a baseline tariff of 10%.\nDespite initial expressions of interest in formal trade agreements, Trump has recently suggested that the letters themselves constitute a form of dealmaking. Still, countries may reduce their rates through side agreements.\nOn Tuesday, the White House announced that Trump had agreed to reduce a proposed 25% tariff on Japan to 15%. The reduction was made in exchange for Japan lifting certain restrictions on US products and pledging $550 billion in US investments.\nA similar deal is reportedly under discussion with South Korea, according to people familiar with the matter. That country is also working toward securing a 15% tariff rate, including on automobiles.\nIn Southeast Asia, the Philippines is also seeking to lower its rate.\nAccording to the country\u2019s ambassador to the US, Jose Manuel Romualdez, the Philippines hopes to bring down its current tariff rate from 19% to 15%.\nVietnam, another country weighing its options, is assessing the possible consequences of not securing a trade agreement. An internal Vietnamese government estimate projects that its exports to the US could fall by as much as one-third if higher tariffs take effect.\nIndia and members of the European Union are also pushing for trade agreements before the new tariffs are enacted. As the deadline nears, multiple governments are working to either strike a deal or gauge the economic impact of the proposed levies.\nTrump\u2019s increasingly firm stance on tariffs suggests a broader strategy to use trade policy as a lever for international concessions.\nWith the Aug. 1 implementation date fast approaching, the administration is signaling that countries will either accept the new terms or negotiate quickly to avoid higher costs."

RH, formerly Restoration Hardware and Williams-Sonoma have been working to diversify their supply chains.\nNew tariffs could drive up costs for many of these major furniture brands. But not for all of them.\nShares of La-Z-Boy, which has most of its manufacturing in the U.S., rose on the news of Trump's tariff plans.\nTrump has already put steep tariffs on cars, steel and aluminum and he has floated similar customs duties for imported copper, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.\nIt was unclear Friday whether new, sectoral tariffs on furniture would be applied on top of country specific tariff rates.\nThe Trump administration has spent months holding bilateral negotiations with U.S. trade partners in an effort to reset the balance of global trade. Recent framework agreements with the European Union and China have helped to calm markets, but leave many longer-term issues unresolved.\nAny new tariffs would come at a difficult moment for the U.S. furniture industry, which faces a range of challenges.\nCompanies like Wayfair have seen demand fall for more than a year on items like new couches and dining sets, a drop caused in part by a slower overall housing market as buyers wait for interest rates to come down.\nWith fewer new homes being bought, consumers have fewer reasons to buy new furniture.\nPlus, with stubborn inflation, they have been more choosy on where they are spending their discretionary income. Restaurants, new clothes, trips and home decor have all taken a hit.\n\u2014 CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge contributed to this report."

  "argos_summary": "President Trump announced a 50\u2011day investigation into imported furniture that could lead to new tariffs, sending shares of Wayfair, RH, and Williams\u2011Sonoma sharply lower while boosting La\u2011Z\u2011Boy, which manufactures mainly in the U.S. The move follows Trump\u2019s broader tariff push on cars, steel, aluminum, and other sectors and comes amid a slump in the housing market that has dampened demand for big\u2011ticket items. Trump\u2019s tariff strategy aims to bring manufacturing back to states with historic furniture\u2011making traditions, but it adds uncertainty to an industry already facing high inflation and a slowdown in new home sales. The announcement also underscores the administration\u2019s ongoing trade negotiations with partners such as the EU and China, which have helped calm markets but left many long\u2011term disputes unresolved.",
