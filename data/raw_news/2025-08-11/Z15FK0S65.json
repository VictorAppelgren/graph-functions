  "description": "Amazon is offering a massive $2,100 discount on this laptop, but it is likely going to end soon.",
  "content": "Tech gear prices feel like they\u2019re at an all-time high right now. If you\u2019ve been looking forward to a laptop upgrade but feel like your options under $1,000 are limited, we have good news.\n\nThe HP 15.6-inch touchscreen business laptop has dropped to $900 after a massive 70% discount on Amazon. Considering how HP makes some of the best machines out there, this is a rare chance to get premium performance at a budget-friendly price.\n\nFlaunting the classic HP style, this sleek machine packs serious power. Starting with the basics, you\u2019re getting a decent 15.6 inches touchscreen display with Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution. This means great visuals for all your tasks, including studying, presentations, and those Netflix sessions. This device isn\u2019t a 2-in-1 convertible, so while you won\u2019t exactly get a tablet-like experience with the touchscreen, it\u2019s still decent for navigation.\n\nVisuals are made even better with the Intel Iris Xe Graphics, which offers smooth playback and sharp details. That\u2019s a boost from the standard Intel UHD graphics you find in many budget laptops. Pair this with the 13th Gen Intel Core i7-1355U processor with 10 cores and 12 threads, and you\u2019re looking at impressive power for multitasking, as well. Data-heavy projectors or some creative tasks \u2013 it takes care of it all.\n\nOf course, speeds matter and for that, you\u2019ve got 32GB of DDR4 RAM. This is more than enough to switch between multiple programs without experiencing lag. Store all your documents, media content, and games with the 1TB PCIe SSD that also ensures quicker file access. HP calls it a business laptop, but with this power, it easily doubles as a solid choice for students as well as remote workers.\n\nThe design is portable. At just 3.52 lbs and under an inch thick, carrying it around where life leads you is easy. Battery life is up to 7 hours and 45 minutes on mixed usage, which should cover most of a workday. Plus, fast charging support means you can juice it back up in no time.\n\nConnectivity-wise, you\u2019re getting multiple USB-A ports, a USB-C port, HDMI for presentations, and a headphone/mic combo jack. Some other features that deserve a mention include the built-in HP True Vision HD camera and noise reduction software that work together to make video calls a breeze. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, so start using it right away.\n\nAt $900, you\u2019re getting a laptop that\u2019s built for serious work but priced like a mid-range machine. If you\u2019ve been wanting to upgrade, don\u2019t miss out on this deal.",
