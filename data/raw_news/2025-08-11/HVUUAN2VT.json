  "description": "AMC CEO Adam Aron revealed that he has switched from Google to OpenAI's ChatGPT and discussed how artificial intelligence is transforming the company's operations, driving growth, and fueling future investments.",
  "content": "AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.\u2019s AMC CEO Adam Aron has revealed that he has switched from Alphabet Inc.'s GOOG GOOGL Google to OpenAI's ChatGPT and explained how artificial intelligence is transforming the company\u2019s operations and fueling growth.\n\nDuring AMC Entertainment\u2019s second-quarter earnings call on Monday, Aron shared how the company is leveraging AI to drive significant improvements across its operations.\n\nAron stated that he had personally \"abandoned Google in exchange for ChatGPT\" and highlighted how AI is becoming a core part of AMC's strategy.\n\n\"We're already using it [AI] in software development, software optimization and software testing. We're using it in image creation for marketing. We're using it for the automation and simplification of tasks here in our corporate office,\" said Aron.\n\nHe also highlighted AI's role in demand planning for AMC's theaters.\n\nSee Also: Ramit Sethi Lays Out the Most Common Money Traps\u2014And How To Dodge Them Before It's Too Late\n\nAI And Investments In The Entertainment Sector\n\nAron shared that AMC is in discussions to make small investments in AI technology-enabled businesses.\n\n\"We've just scratched the surface with AI,\" Aron said. \"Going forward, there'll be an opportunity for us to take care take advantage of the powerful AI technology to assess with our pricing, with our film scheduling, with our customer service programs and our consumer response programs.\"\n\nThe company reported a significant year-over-year revenue increase of 35%, driven by a 25.6% rise in attendance, totaling approximately 62.81 million.\n\nGoogle Vs ChatGPT And Other AI Platforms\n\nIn December 2022, Google launched a 100-day mission to build a rival to OpenAI's ChatGPT, tasking veteran executive Sissie Hsiao with assembling a team to create the chatbot Bard, now under the Gemini umbrella.\n\nThe effort was part of a \"code red\" response to ChatGPT's rapid rise and its integration into Microsoft Corporation's MSFT Bing search engine.\n\nDespite early setbacks \u2014 including inaccuracies, offensive responses and a factual error in a marketing video that dented Alphabet's stock \u2014 Google accelerated Bard's development, branding it an \"experiment\" to manage expectations.\n\nTo strengthen its AI push, Google merged its DeepMind and Google Brain teams, resulting in the Gemini language model, which reportedly surpassed ChatGPT in several tests.\n\nToday, the tech giant maintained confidence in its long-term AI competitiveness, but the platform's ability continues to be pitted against the likes of ChatGPT, Reddit Inc. RDDT, Perplexity and more.\n\nPrice Action: On Monday, AMC shares rose 3.41% before slipping 0.67% in after-hours trading to $3.01 at the time of writing, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nBenzinga's Edge Stock Rankings indicate that AMC has been trending downward across short, medium and long-term periods.

      "text": "A high salary doesn't guarantee that you'll escape a life of living paycheck to paycheck. Approximately one-third of Americans making $250,000 per year are one missed paycheck away from falling behind on expenses.\nThe higher cost of living has made it difficult for most people to stay afloat, but the impact on high earners is astonishing. However, the cost of living isn't entirely to blame, especially for most Americans who earn more than $250,000 per year.\nFinancial guru Ramit Sethi recently laid out some of the most common money traps that can make it harder to become debt-free and build wealth. Knowing these money traps can put you on the path to a six-figure net worth and result in more ambitious goals in the future.\nDon't Miss:\n- The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market \u2014 and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n- \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\nToday's Best Finance Deals\nGet Rich Quick\nSethi started his list by pointing at get rich quick schemes. While side hustle culture has brought forth plenty of training courses that promise riches, Sethi expanded the definition to meme stocks and buying Airbnb properties without considering the downsides.\nThese schemes sound too good to be true, and they often are. The get rich quick route is bad for your finances since the misguided sense of hope can result in reckless investments and wasting a lot of time that could have been spent on something more productive.\nThe best opportunities take many years to materialize. It's very difficult to get rich in a few months, but you can become rich in several years with the right mentality.\nToxic Frugality Extremism\nIt's good to stay on top of your finances, have a budget, and say no to various purchases. Although this is a healthy practice, every good thing has an extreme.\nSeth defines toxic frugality extremism as penny pinching and not spending money, even when it would make sense to do so. Some people end up with fat bank accounts but very little to show for their lives. That's an effect of toxic frugality extremism.\nTrending: Accredited Investors: Grab Pre-IPO Shares of the AI Company Powering Hasbro, Sephora & MGM\u2014Secure $0.63 Shares Before 8/14\nSpending money on things and experiences that you enjoy can inspire you to make more money. It's good to play defense with your budget, but financial discipline gives you permission to go on the offensive sometimes and spend money on things that matter. Most people talk about the dangers of impulsive spending, but it's not as common for people to discuss the downsides of hoarding their money and ending up with poor living conditions.\n\"I Missed My Chance\" Syndrome\nYou will miss out on some good opportunities. Some people think about how their lives would be different if they bought Nvidia NVDA or Palantir PLTR five years ago. It's also common for people to miss out on career opportunities or use their money in suboptimal ways.\nSome people may bemoan these shortcomings and say that they missed their chance, but Sethi disagrees. He emphasizes that you can get started with building your financial future right now, even if you're late to the party. Focus on what you can do now and the opportunities that are in front of you instead of sulking about missed opportunities and believing that you missed your chance.\nSee Also: $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes \u2013 no cost, no obligation.\nThe Optimization Spiral\nOptimizing your finances is good, but too much optimization can turn into a burden. For instance, some people switch savings accounts every six months just to earn a slightly higher interest rate. It's similar to how people open new credit cards every few months just to get the welcome bonuses.\nWhile these optimizations will put you ahead, they're not worth the time. You can make more money by using that same time to develop new skills that let you advance in your career. Professional development can open far more doors than switching bank accounts and opening new credit cards. Boosting your income from $50,000 to $100,000 will do you a lot more good than switching to an account with an extra 0.20% APY.\nRead Next: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here\u2019s how you can earn passive income with just $10.\nImage: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s AMD Lisa Su said the company is making progress with U.S. regulators on AI chip export licenses to China and is preparing for eventual shipments of its MI308 GPUs.\nProgress With US Regulators On China AI Chip Licenses\nDuring AMD\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, Su addressed concerns over the company\u2019s business in China, stating that AMD has been working closely with the Donald Trump administration to secure licenses for its MI308 AI chips.\n\u201cWe're very pleased with the progress that's been made with the administration over the last couple of months,\u201d Su said. \u201cThis is a better position than we were 90 days ago.\u201d\nSu added that while AMD has not yet received export licenses for the MI308 chips, several applications are under review by the U.S. Department of Commerce.\nThese licenses are required due to the ongoing U.S. export restrictions on advanced AI hardware to China.\nChina Remains A Strategic Market Amid Export Restrictions\nSu said that China continues to be an important market for AMD, despite the geopolitical challenges. She expressed support for the global use of U.S. technology, stating that the company is committed to contributing to that effort.\nThe U.S. government has tightened export controls on AI hardware over concerns about China's military modernization. The MI308, one of AMD's advanced data center chips, falls under those restrictions.\nMI308 Inventory Largely In Process, Not Finished Goods\nWhile awaiting licenses, AMD has been holding inventory related to the MI308, but Su noted that most of it is still in the production phase.\n\u201cIn terms of the supply chain, most of our inventory was not in finished goods. So it was work in process and it'll take us a couple of quarters to run through that,\u201d she stated.\nThe timeline for revenue contribution from the MI308 depends on when export approvals are granted.\nAMD Eyes Rebound In China Strategy As AI Demand Grows\nSu's comments suggest AMD is positioning itself to re-enter the Chinese AI market as soon as regulations allow. \u201cChina is an important market for us. Given the timing of licenses, we have a number of licenses that are under review now.\u201d\nAMD posted second-quarter revenue of $7.69 billion, surpassing the $7.41 billion forecast by analysts. However, its adjusted earnings came in at 48 cents per share, slightly below the expected 49 cents.\nAMD projects third-quarter revenue to be around $8.7 billion, give or take $300 million. In comparison, analysts are estimating revenue of roughly $8.15 billion.\nPrice Action: AMD shares have risen approximately 44.50% year-to-date. However, as of the latest check on Wednesday, the stock was down 4.37% in pre-market trading, trading at $166.70, according to Benzinga Pro.\nBenzinga's Edge Stock Rankings show that AMD continues to demonstrate strong upward momentum across short, medium and long-term timeframes.

The company reported breakeven adjusted earnings per share versus estimates for a loss of 9 cents per share.\nTotal revenue was up more than 35% on a year-over-year basis as attendance totaled approximately 62.81 million in the quarter, up 25.6% year-over-year. U.S. attendance came in at 46.89 million, up 28.5% year-over-year.\nNet cash provided by operations was $138.4 million in the quarter, and AMC generated $88.9 million of free cash flow in the period. The company ended the quarter with $423.7 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n\"Our second quarter results are a combination of a recovering industry-wide box office, and the undeniable fact that both AMC and Odeon are executing so well in so many different ways. Indeed, we shattered alltime records across nearly every per patron metric,\u201d said Adam Aron, chairman and CEO of AMC.\nRevenue per patron was $12.14 in the quarter and consolidated food and beverage revenue per guest hit a record $7.95. Total consolidated revenue per patron was $22.26 in the second quarter.\n\u201cThe combination of a resurgent box office, our unparalleled theatre footprint with premium experiences galore, our compelling marketing programs and our increasing financial strength have a flywheel impact when they all are happening simultaneously,\u201d Aron said.\nAMC\u2019s management team will further discuss the quarter on an earnings call set for 5 p.m. ET.\nAMC Price Action: AMC shares were up 4.37% at $3.06 at the time of publication Monday, according to Benzinga Pro.\nRead Next:\n- Retail Crowd\u2019s Top Stocks With Earnings This Week: Archer, Rigetti, Oklo And More\n- Ramit Sethi Lays Out the Most Common Money Traps\u2014And How To Dodge Them Before It\u2019s Too Late\nPhoto: Shutterstock.\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Reddit Inc. RDDT is gaining increased visibility in Alphabet Inc.'s GOOG GOOGL Google's AI Overviews, but analysts say that traffic boost may not translate into meaningful revenue growth.\nWhat Happened: According to data from analytics firm Semrush, Reddit is the second most-cited source in Google's AI-generated summaries, trailing only Quora.\nThe rise is likely tied to a $60 million content licensing deal Reddit signed with Google in 2024, which allows Google to use Reddit data to train its AI systems and display it more prominently in search.\n\"Quora and Reddit users often ask and answer niche questions that aren't addressed elsewhere,\" the Semrush report said, adding, \"Making them rich information sources for highly specific AI prompts.\"\nBut while this exposure is boosting Reddit's web traffic, it's coming largely from \"logged-out users\"\u2014people who click Reddit links from Google but don't sign in or stick around, reported Business Insider.\nAnalysts at Redburn wrote in March, \"Accelerated user growth has been driven predominantly by logged-out users who arrive on the platform largely via Google Search.\"\n\"These users are much less valuable to Reddit as they are typically just looking for an answer to a query and thus spend little time on the platform,\" the analyst continued, the report added.\nMoreover, with Google's AI Overviews summarizing Reddit content directly on the search page, fewer users may click through to Reddit at all, the report said.\nWhy It's Important: Reddit, which went public in 2023, is under mounting pressure to grow ad revenue and prove long-term profitability, the report noted.\nWhile its partnership with Google has increased exposure, the quality of that traffic matters more than volume.\nAs Google leans more heavily on AI-generated answers, Reddit may find itself widely cited but less visited, posing a challenge for monetization. Last month, Google launched a new \"AI mode\" in Search and Chrome for U.S. users, providing a ChatGPT-like conversational experience instead of traditional search results.\nPrice Action: Reddit shares have declined 28.77% year-to-date but have surged 95.82% over the past 12 months, according to Benzinga Pro data.\nBenzinga's Edge Stock Rankings show a steady upward trend for Reddit in the short and long term, while reflecting a downward movement in the medium term.
