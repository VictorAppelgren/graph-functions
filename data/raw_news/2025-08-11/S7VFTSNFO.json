  "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Inflation likely ticked up in July for the third straight month as tariffs lift the cost of imported goods such as furniture, appliances, and toys, which could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates as President Donald Trump has demanded.\n\nConsumer prices are forecast to have risen 2.8% in July from a year earlier, according to a survey of economists by data provider FactSet. That annual pace would be up from 2.7% in June and a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, core inflation is expected to rise to 3%, from 2.9% in June. Both figures are well above the Fed\u2019s 2% price target.\n\nThe potential increases, while modest, would put the Fed in a difficult spot: Hiring slowed sharply in the spring, after Trump announced a sweeping set of tariffs in April. The stalling out of job gains has boosted financial market expectations for an interest rate cut by the central bank.\n\nYet Fed chair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines \u2014 a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs.\n\nTuesday\u2019s data will also arrive at a highly-charged moment for the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and publishes the inflation data. Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, then the head of BLS, after the Aug. 1 jobs report also showed sharply lower hiring for May and June than had previously been reported.\n\nThe president posted on social media Monday that he has picked E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a frequent critic of the jobs report, to replace McEntarfer.\n\n\u201cE.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.\n\nAdding to the BLS\u2019s turmoil is a government-wide hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the amount of data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said. UBS economist Alan Detmeister estimates that BLS is now collecting about 18% fewer price quotes for the inflation report than it did a few months ago. He thinks the report will produce more volatile results, though averaged out over time, still reliable.\n\nOn a monthly basis, prices are expected to rise modestly, increasing just 0.2% from June to July and core prices rising 0.3%. Gas prices likely fell in July and grocery costs are expected to barely increase, muting overall inflation.\n\nSigns of duties pushing up prices first emerged in the June inflation report released last month. Toy prices jumped 1.8% from May to June, after a 1.3% increase the previous month. Clothing prices rose 0.4% in June, while sporting goods leapt 1.8%.\n\nMeanwhile, the average tariff level has climbed from about 2% before Trump\u2019s inauguration to nearly 18%, the highest since the early 1930s, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. Most imports from the European Union and Japan now face duties of 15%, while goods from Taiwan pay 20% and Switzerland, 39%.\n\nOther trends are helping keep inflation from rising more quickly. Price increases for apartment rents, for example, are steadily cooling after sharp spikes during the pandemic era. And prices for new cars have declined slightly in recent months, even after Trump slapped 25% duties on autos and auto parts.\n\nSo far, U.S. and overseas carmakers are paying the tariffs, though economists say they likely will pass them on to consumers soon. Car companies are also paying 50% import taxes on steel and aluminum and 30% on parts from China.\n\nFord has said it paid $800 million in tariffs in the second quarter, while General Motors shouldered $1.1 billion. Stellantis, the world\u2019s fourth-largest carmaker and the maker of brands such as Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep, has said it has paid $350 million in tariffs out of a $1.7 billion expected cost this year.\n\nConsumers are likely to absorb more costs beyond the auto industry in the coming months, as Trump has begun to finalize many tariffs. Once businesses know what they will be paying, they are more likely to pass those costs to consumers, economists say.\n\nTrump has insisted that overseas manufacturers will pay the tariffs by reducing their prices to offset the duties. Yet the pre-tariff prices of imports haven\u2019t fallen much since the levies were put in place.\n\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs estimate that foreign manufacturers have absorbed just 14% of the duties through June, while 22% has been paid by consumers and 64% by U.S. companies. Based on previous patterns, however \u2014 such as Trump\u2019s 2018 duties on washing machines \u2014 the economists expect that by this fall consumers will bear 67% of the burden, while foreign exporters pay 25% and U.S. companies handle just 8%.\n\nMany large firms are still raising prices in response to the tariffs, including apparel makers Ralph Lauren and Under Armour, and eyewear company Warby Parker.\n\nConsumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages.\n\nAnd cosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty, which makes a majority of its products in China, said on Wednesday that it had raised prices by a dollar on its entire product assortment as of Aug. 1 because of tariff costs, the third price hike in its 21-year history.\n\n\u201cWe tend to lead and then we will see how many more kind of follow us,\u201d CEO Tarang Amin said on an earnings call Wednesday.\n\nMatt Pavich, CEO of Revionics, a company that provides AI tools to large retailers to help them evaluate pricing decisions, says many companies are raising prices selectively to offset tariffs, rather than across the board.\n\n\u201cUp until now we haven\u2019t seen a massive hit to consumers in retail prices,\u201d Pavich said. \u201cNow, they are going up, we\u2019ve seen that.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press Retail Writer Anne D\u2019Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.",

      "text": "A top Federal Reserve official says dour jobs data backs the case for 3 rate cuts\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A top official at the Federal Reserve said Saturday that this month\u2019s stunning, weaker-than-expected report on the U.S. job market is strengthening her belief that interest rates should be lower.\nMichelle Bowman was one of two Fed officials who voted a week and a half ago in favor of cutting interest rates. Such a move could help boost the economy by making it cheaper for people to borrow money to buy a house or a car, but it could also threaten to push inflation higher.\nBowman and a fellow dissenter lost out after nine other Fed officials voted to keep interest rates steady, as the Fed has been doing all year. The Fed\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell, has been adamant that he wants to wait for more data about how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are affecting inflation before the Fed makes its next move.\nAt a speech during a bankers\u2019 conference in Colorado on Saturday, Bowman said that \u201cthe latest labor market data reinforce my view\u201d that the Fed should cut interest rates three times this year. The Fed has only three meetings left on the schedule in 2025.\nThe jobs report that arrived last week, only a couple of days after the Fed voted on interest rates, showed that employers hired far fewer workers last month than economists expected. It also said that hiring in prior months was much lower than initially thought.\nOn inflation, meanwhile, Bowman said she is getting more confident that Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cwill not present a persistent shock to inflation\u201d and sees it moving closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Inflation has come down substantially since hitting a peak above 9% after the pandemic, but it has been stubbornly remaining above 2%.\nThe Fed\u2019s job is to keep the job market strong, while keeping a lid on inflation. Its challenge is that it has one main tool to affect both those areas, and helping one by moving interest rates up or down often means hurting the other.\nA fear is that Trump\u2019s tariffs could box in the Federal Reserve by sticking the economy in a worst-case scenario called \u201cstagflation,\u201d where the economy stagnates but inflation is high. The Fed has no good tool to fix that, and it would likely have to prioritize either the job market or inflation before helping the other.\nOn Wall Street, expectations are that the Fed will have to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September after the U.S. jobs report came in so much below economists\u2019 expectations.\nTrump has been calling angrily for lower interest rates, often personally insulting Powell while doing so. He has the opportunity to add another person to the Fed\u2019s board of governors after an appointee of former President Joe Biden stepped down recently."

      "text": "The tariff-driven inflation that economists feared begins to emerge\nInflation rose last month to its highest level since February as President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs push up the cost of a range of goods, including furniture, clothing, and large appliances.\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Inflation rose last month to its highest level since February as President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs push up the cost of everything from groceries and clothes to furniture and appliances.\nConsumer prices rose 2.7% in June from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, up from an annual increase of 2.4% in May. On a monthly basis, prices climbed 0.3% from May to June, after rising just 0.1% the previous month.\nWorsening inflation poses a political challenge for Trump, who as a candidate promised to immediately lower costs, but instead has engaged in a whipsawed frenzy of tariffs that have jolted businesses and consumers. Trump insists that the U.S. effectively has no inflation as he has attempted to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into cutting short-term interest rates.\nYet the new inflation numbers make it more likely that the central bank will leave rates where they are. Powell has said that he wants to gauge the economic impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs before reducing borrowing costs.\nExcluding volatile food and energy, core inflation increased 2.9% in June from a year earlier, up from 2.8% in May. On a monthly basis, it picked up 0.2% from May to June. Economists closely watch core prices because they typically provide a better sense of where inflation is headed.\nThe uptick in inflation was driven by a range of higher prices. The cost of gasoline rose 1% just from May to June, while grocery prices increased 0.3%. Appliance prices jumped for the third straight month. Toys, clothes, audio equipment, shoes, and sporting goods all got more expensive, and are all heavily imported.\n\u201cYou are starting to see scattered bits of the tariff inflation regime filter in,\u201d said Eric Winograd, chief economist at asset management firm AllianceBernstein, who added that the cost of long-lasting goods rose last month, compared with a year ago, for the first time in about three years.\nWinograd also noted that housing costs, a big inflation driver since the pandemic, have continued to cool, actually holding down broader inflation. The cost of rent rose 3.8% in June compared with a year ago, the smallest yearly increase since late 2021.\n\u201cWere it not for the tariff uncertainty, the Fed would already be cutting rates,\u201d Winograd said. \u201cThe question is whether there is more to come, and the Fed clearly thinks there is,\u201d along with most economists.\nSome items got cheaper last month, including new and used cars, hotel rooms, and airfares. Travel prices have generally declined in recent months as fewer international tourists visit the U.S.\nA broader political battle over Trump\u2019s tariffs is emerging, a fight that will ultimately be determined by how the U.S. public feels about their cost of living and whether the president is making good on his 2024 promise to help the middle class.\nThe White House pushed back on claims that the report showed a negative impact from tariffs, since the cost of new cars fell despite the 25% tariffs on autos and 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum. The administration also noted that despite the June bump in apparel prices, clothing prices are still cheaper than three months ago.\n\u201cConsumer Prices LOW,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cBring down the Fed Rate, NOW!!!\u201d\nFor Democratic lawmakers, the inflation report confirmed their warnings over the past several months that Trump\u2019s tariffs could reignite inflation. They said Tuesday that it will only become more painful given the size of the tariff rates in the letters that Trump posted over the past week.\n\u201cFor those saying we have not seen the impact of Trump\u2019s tariff wars, look at today\u2019s data. Americans continue to struggle with the costs of groceries and rent \u2014 and now prices of food and appliances are rising,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\nMany businesses built up a stockpile of goods this spring and were able to delay price hikes, while others likely waited to see if the duties would become permanent.\nMore businesses now appear to be throwing in the towel and passing on costs to consumers, including Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, which has said it raised prices in June. Automaker Mitsubishi said last month that it was lifting prices by an average of 2.1% in response to the duties, and Nike has said it would implement \u201csurgical\u201d price hikes.\nPowell said last month that companies up and down the supply chain would seek to avoid paying tariffs, but that ultimately some combination of businesses and consumers would bear the cost.\n\u201cThere\u2019s the manufacturer, the exporter, the importer, the retailer, and the consumer, and each one of those is going to be trying not to be the one to pay for the tariff,\u201d the Fed chair said. \u201cBut together, they will all pay for it together\u2014or maybe one party will pay it all. But that process is very hard to predict, and we haven\u2019t been through a situation like this.\u201d\nTrump has imposed sweeping duties of 10% on all imports plus 30% on goods from China. Last week the president threatened to hit the European Union with a new 30% tariff starting Aug. 1.\nHe has also threatened to slap 50% duties on Brazil, which would push up the cost of orange juice and coffee. Orange prices leaped 3.5% just from May to June, and are 3.4% higher than a year ago, the government said Tuesday.\nOverall, grocery prices rose 0.3% last month and are up 2.4% from a year earlier. While that is a much smaller increase than after the pandemic, when inflation surged, it is slightly bigger than the pre-pandemic pace. The Trump administration has also placed a 17% duty on Mexican tomatoes.\nFamilies have cut spending on food as prices rise. Cassidy Grom, 29, her husband, and his mother are eating out less and try to stretch grocery store rotisserie chickens as far as possible, using them in salads and the bones for soup.\n\u201cIt feels like a miracle if I\u2019m able to leave the grocery store without spending $100,\u201d the Edison, New Jersey resident said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to save for a house, we\u2019re trying to save for a family, so prices are really on our mind.\u201d\nAccelerated inflation could provide a respite for Powell, who has come under withering fire from the White House over interest rates.\nThe Fed chair has said that the duties could both push up prices and slow the economy, a tricky combination for the central bank since higher costs would typically lead the Fed to hike rates while a weaker economy often spurs it to reduce them."

Antoni, chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the agency that compiles and publishes the nation\u2019s employment and inflation figures.\n\u201cOur Economy is booming, and E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,\u201d Trump said on social media late Monday.\nAntoni, if approved by the Senate, would replace Erika McEntarfer, who was appointed commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics by former President Joe Biden. Trump fired McEntarfer Aug. 1 after the July jobs report showed hiring slowed sharply this spring, with job gains in May and June revised much lower than initially estimated.\nTrump accused McEntarfer, without evidence, of rigging the jobs data for political reasons.\nThe announcement comes one day before the BLS is scheduled to release the latest inflation data, for July. It is forecast to show that consumer prices rose for the third straight month as tariffs are pushing up the cost of many imported goods.\nAntoni has criticized the bureau\u2019s\u2019 collection and publication of the jobs data for years, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic, after which the agency has frequently revised its initial jobs estimates lower. Many conservatives have argued that this potentially benefited Biden by producing a large initial monthly job gain, only to have it reduced in subsequent months.\nHowever, revisions \u2014 including downward revisions \u2014 are not unusual and occurred during the Trump administration as well. Overall hiring jumped after the pandemic and the unemployment rate stayed low even after the revisions.\nAntoni called for McEntarfer to be fired after the jobs report was released Aug. 1. Last Monday he wrote on X, \u201cThere are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data \u2014 that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years.\u201d\nThe BLS commissioner is the only political appointee at the agency, which is otherwise staffed by career civil servants. Most previous commissioners have been mild-mannered technocrats.\nAntoni, however, has been an unabashed partisan in his economic analyses posted on the Heritage website. For example, two months ago, in an analysis of the May jobs report, he wrote, \u201cA deep dive into the report shows any weakness started long before the Trump administration, which is making undeniable progress reprivatizing the economy.\u201d\nAntoni\u2019s nomination quickly attracted an unusual level of criticism.\nJason Furman, a top economist in the Obama administration, wrote on X: \u201cI don\u2019t think I have ever publicly criticized any Presidential nominee before. But E.J. Antoni is completely unqualified to be BLS Commissioner. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant expertise.\u201d\nKyle Pomeleau, a tax expert for the right-leaning Tax Foundation and the conservative American Enterprise Institute, wrote on X: \u201cThere are a lot of competent conservative economists that could do this job. E.J. is not one of them.\u201d ___\nAssociated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report."

But economists don\u2019t expect that to last\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Inflation cooled for the third straight month in April even after some of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect, though economists and many business owners expect inflation will climb by this summer.\nConsumer prices rose 2.3% in April from a year ago, the Labor Department said Tuesday, down from 2.4% in March and the smallest increase in more than four years. On a monthly basis, prices rose modestly, increasing 0.2% from March to April after falling 0.1% the previous month, the first drop in five years.\nGrocery prices dipped 0.4% from March to April in what will come as a relief to many people stretching family budgets for the basics. It was the biggest decline in food costs at home since September 2020, the government said. Egg prices fell sharply, declining 12.7%, the most in 41 years. Yet they are still 49% higher than a year ago.\nOverall, the report suggests tariffs haven\u2019t yet impacted prices for many items. Economists say the impact will more likely be seen by June or July. The 10% tariff on all goods that took effect April 5 could take two to three months to feed into the inflation data. And many companies built stockpiles of products earlier this year, enabling them to delay price hikes in hopes that the trade war will cool.\nThe cost of clothing, which is mostly imported, declined 0.2% from March to April, Tuesday\u2019s report said. New car prices were unchanged. And grocery prices fell despite fears that tariffs on some goods from Mexico would boost food costs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s early days for tariff effects,\u201d said Laura Rosner-Warburton, co-founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives and formerly an economist at the Federal Reserve\u2019s New York branch. \u201cMore will come in May, June, and July. There are plenty of price increases already scheduled and on the way.\u201d\nAnd there were some early signs that the duties are having an impact. Computer prices rose 0.3% from March to April, a category that is heavily imported from China and usually sees mild price declines. Sporting goods and toys, where many products are imported, also saw increases. And a category that includes baby strollers and car seats also got more expensive.\nStill, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices were also muted, rising 2.8% in April compared with a year ago, the same as in March. On a monthly basis, they increased a mild 0.2%. Economists watch core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.\nRosner-Warburton noted that some prices fell as business weakened, particularly in travel. Air fares and hotel prices dropped noticeably last month, contributing to lower inflation, but that may have been driven by a decline in foreign visitors to the U.S.\nSome companies have raised prices and others have said they plan to do so as a result of the duties. Mattel Inc., the maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars, said earlier this month it would have to raise prices on some products. The company makes 40% of its products in China.\nTool maker Stanley Black & Decker said it raised prices in April and plans to do so again in the July-September quarter because of higher tariffs. And executives at Procter & Gamble, the consumer products giant that makes household name brands such as Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent, and Charmin toilet paper, said last month it will likely have to pass on higher prices to consumers as soon as July.\nOnly some early tariffs imposed by Trump were in effect in April, including 25% duties on steel and aluminum and 25% on some imports from Canada and Mexico. Trump\u2019s initial 20% import taxes on goods from China were also in place. The steel and aluminum duties will take time to feed through into consumer products, such as cars, and may not affect retail prices for months.\nTrump\u2019s huge 145% import taxes on Chinese goods were reduced to 30% in a deal announced Monday, with some of the higher tariffs on pause for 90 days. Retailers and importers had largely stopped shipping shoes, clothes, toys, and other items when the duties were so high, but many will now resume importing from China, which should reduce the chances of empty shelves this fall.\nYet the additional 30% duties, on top of other import taxes, will likely affect prices. The Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a trade group, says children\u2019s shoes from China will now pay a nearly 100% tariff, because the latest duties are on top of previous import taxes.\nMatt Priest, president and CEO of the FDRA, said that the cost of shipping goods from China will likely rise as many companies scramble to get orders to the U.S. during the 90-day window.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not out of the inflationary cost woods yet,\u201d he said.\nAnd economists say average tariffs are now at about 18%, roughly six times higher than before Trump took office and the highest in about 90 years.\nConsumer prices cooled noticeably in February and March, prompting Trump to claim repeatedly on social media that there is \u201cNO INFLATION.\u201d Inflation has fallen to nearly the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve, the agency charged with fighting higher prices.\nThe Fed would have likely been gearing up to restart interest rate cuts in the absence of tariffs because inflation is down. It reduced its benchmark rate three times last year. However, it has since frozen rates while it awaits further evidence of how the tariffs \u2014 and other policy changes, such as immigration restrictions and potential tax cuts \u2014 affect the economy.\nThe smaller import taxes on Chinese goods will limit the damage to the U.S. economy, but combined with all the other tariffs, economists forecast they will still slow growth this year and worsen inflation.\nThe Yale Budget Lab, for example, estimates the tariffs will lift prices 1.7% and cost the average household about $2,800 this year.\n\u201cThis is still a very, very substantial tariff hike, but it will take awhile\u201d to show up in the inflation data, Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, said.\nMany small businesses are relieved that the U.S. has cut its tariffs on goods from China but say they still aren\u2019t sure what their costs will be for the remainder of this year, or whether they can avoid raising prices themselves.\nRick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, an educational toy company, said that the 145% tariffs would have pushed his tariff bill to $100.2 million from $2.3 million last year.\nHe paused shipments and production but is now strategizing how to work with the lower tariffs. He has 13 containers stored in warehouses in Los Angeles, which allows importers to defer duty payments for up to five years. And he may bring $11 million of goods from China and pay the 30% tariffs, but he\u2019s not sure how to price them.\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know what our costs are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not know what our tariff costs are. We do not know what our freight costs are.\u201d\n__\nAP Retail Writer Anne D\u2019Innocenzio contributed to this report from New York."

But Powell also signaled that it could take months for the Fed to determine whether Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs will push up inflation temporarily or lead to a more persistent bout of higher prices. His comments suggest that a rate cut in September, which had been expected by some economists and investors, is now less likely.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned that the process will probably be slower than expected,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe think we have a long way to go to really understand exactly how\u201d the tariffs will affect inflation and the economy.\nThere were some signs of splits in the Fed\u2019s ranks: Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman voted to reduce borrowing costs, while nine officials, including Powell, favored standing pat. It is the first time in more than three decades that two of the seven Washington-based governors have dissented. One official, Governor Adriana Kugler, was absent and didn\u2019t vote.\nThe choice to hold off on a rate cut will almost certainly result in further conflict between the Fed and White House, as Trump has repeatedly demanded that the central bank reduce borrowing costs as part of his effort to assert control over one of the few remaining independent federal agencies.\nPowell has in the past signaled during a news conference that a rate move might be on the table for an upcoming meeting, but he gave no such hints this time. The odds of a rate cut in September, according to futures pricing, fell from nearly 60% before the meeting to just 45% after the press conference, the equivalent of a coin flip, according to CME Fedwatch.\n\u201cWe have made no decisions about September,\u201d Powell said. The chair acknowledged that if the Fed cut its rate too soon, inflation could move higher, and if it cut too late, then the job market could suffer.\nMajor U.S. stock indexes, which had been trading slightly higher Wednesday, went negative after Powell\u2019s comments.\n\u201cThe markets seem to think that Powell pushed back on a September rate cut,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, chief market strategist at New York Life Investments.\nPowell also underscored that the vast majority of the committee agreed with a basic framework: Inflation is still above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%, while the job market is still mostly healthy, so the Fed should keep rates elevated. On Thursday, the government will release the latest reading of the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, and it is expected to show that core prices, excluding energy and food, rose 2.7% from a year earlier.\nGus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial, says he expects the tariffs will only temporarily raise inflation, but that it will take most of the rest of this year for that to become apparent. He doesn\u2019t expect the Fed to cut until December.\nTrump argues that because the U.S. economy is doing well, rates should be lowered. But unlike a blue-chip company that usually pays lower rates than a troubled startup, it\u2019s different for an entire economy. The Fed adjusts rates to either slow or speed growth, and would be more likely to keep them high if the economy is strong to prevent an inflationary outbreak.\nEarlier Wednesday, the government said the economy expanded at a healthy 3% annual rate in the second quarter, though that figure followed a negative reading for the first three months of the year, when the economy shrank 0.5% at an annual rate. Most economists averaged the two figures to get a growth rate of about 1.2% for the first half of this year.\nThe dissents from Waller and Bowman likely reflect jockeying to replace Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. Waller in particular has been mentioned as a potential future Fed chair.\nMichael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said in a note to clients this week if the pair were to dissent, \u201cit would say more about auditioning for the Fed chair appointment than about economic conditions.\u201d\nBowman, meanwhile, last dissented in September 2024, when the Fed cut its key rate by a half-point. She said she preferred a quarter point cut instead, and cited the fact that inflation was still above 2.5% as a reason for caution.\nWaller said earlier this month that he favored cutting rates, but for very different reasons than Trump has cited: Waller thinks that growth and hiring are slowing, and that the Fed should reduce borrowing costs to forestall a rise in unemployment.\nThere are other camps on the Fed\u2019s 19-member rate-setting committee \u2014 only 12 of the 19 actually vote on rate decisions. In June, seven members signaled that they supported leaving rates unchanged through the end of this year, while two suggested they preferred a single rate cut. The other half supported more reductions, with eight officials backing two cuts, and two \u2014 widely thought to be Waller and Bowman \u2014 supporting three reductions.\nThe dissents could be a preview of what might happen after Powell steps down, if Trump appoints a replacement who pushes for the much lower interest rates the White House desires. Other Fed officials could push back if a future chair sought to cut rates by more than economic conditions would otherwise support.\nOverall, the committee\u2019s quarterly forecasts in June suggested the Fed would cut twice this year. There are only three more Fed policy meetings \u2014 in September, October, and December.\nWhen the Fed cuts its rate, it often \u2014 but not always \u2014 results in lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.\nSome economists agree with Waller\u2019s concerns about the job market. Excluding government hiring, the economy added just 74,000 jobs in June, with most of those gains occurring in health care.\n\u201cWe are in a much slower job hiring backdrop than most people appreciate,\u201d said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 200 points, or 0.5%, while the Nasdaq composite shaved 0.3% off its own record.\nThe highlight of this week for Wall Street will likely arrive on Tuesday, when the government will report how bad inflation was across the country in July. Economists expect it to show U.S. consumers had to pay prices for groceries, gasoline and other costs of living that were 2.8% higher from a year earlier, a slight acceleration from June\u2019s 2.7% inflation.\nInflation has remained above 2%, even if it has improved substantially from its peak above 9% three years ago. And the worry is that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs could push inflation higher.\nWall Street braces for an update on inflation. Here\u2019s AP business correspondent Seth Sutel.\nThat in turn is raising fears about a potential, worst-case scenario called \u201cstagflation\u201d where the economy stagnates but inflation remains high. The Federal Reserve has no good tool to fix both at once, and it would need to concentrate on either the job market or inflation first. But helping one of those areas by moving interest rates would likely hurt the other.\nA top Fed official, Michelle Bowman, said on Saturday that she believes the job market is the bigger concern. She is still backing three cuts to interest rates by the Fed this year following this month\u2019s stunning, weaker-than-expected report on the U.S. job market. Trump has also been angrily calling for cuts to interest rates to support the economy.\nOther Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have been more hesitant. Powell has said he wants to wait for more data about how Trump\u2019s tariffs are affecting inflation before the Fed makes its next move, and Tuesday\u2019s update on the consumer price index may offer a big clue about that.\nStrategists at Stifel are warning that stagflation may already be on the way, with spending by U.S. consumers slowing. That in turn could create a reckoning for investors after they sent stock prices soaring to records from their low point in April.\n\u201cRate cuts cannot save an overvalued S&P 500,\u201d according to the strategists, led by Thomas Carroll and Barry Bannister.\nOne way companies can make their stock prices appear less expensive is to deliver bigger profits.\nMicron Technology climbed 4.1% after raising its forecasts for profit and revenue in the current quarter, which will end later this month. The maker of memory for computers said it\u2019s benefiting from higher prices for its products.\nAMC Entertainment rose 3.4% to trim its loss for the year so far, which came into the day at 26.4%, after reporting better results for the spring than analysts expected. The theater chain said moviegoers paid more for tickets, while also spending more on food and drinks.\nTKO Group Holdings climbed 10.2% after reaching a deal to distribute its UFC mixed martial arts matches on the Paramount+ streaming platform. But Paramount Skydance\u2019s stock dropped 3.7%.\nAlso on the losing side of Wall Street was C3.ai after the AI application software company warned it may report an operating loss as large as $124.9 million for its first quarter. CEO Thomas Siebel called the first-quarter sales results \u201ccompletely unacceptable,\u201d and its stock tumbled 25.6%.\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 16.00 points to 6,373.45. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 200.52 to 43,975.09, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 64.62 to 21,385.40.\nThe price of gold, meanwhile, eased after Trump said he would not place tariffs on the metal. That followed Friday\u2019s brouhaha in the gold market after the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seemed to rule that some kinds of gold bars coming from Switzerland would face a tariff. That in turn caused a disconnect between the prices of gold trading in New York versus in London, but the market has since calmed.\nGold for December delivery settled at $3,404.70 per ounce in New York, down 2.5%.\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed amid mostly modest movements across Europe and Asia.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 4.27%, where it was late Friday.\n___\nAP Business Writers Wyatte Grantham-Philips and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed."

      "text": "Whitmer told Trump in private that Michigan auto jobs depend on a tariff change of course\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer met privately in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump to make a case he did not want to hear: The automotive industry he said he wants to save was being hurt by his tariffs.\nThe Democrat came with a slide deck to make her points in a visual presentation. Just getting the meeting Tuesday with the Republican president was an achievement for someone viewed as a contender for her party\u2019s White House nomination in 2028.\nWhitmer\u2019s strategy for dealing with Trump highlights the conundrum for her and other Democratic leaders as they try to protect the interests of their states while voicing their opposition to his agenda. It\u2019s a dynamic that Whitmer has navigated much differently from many other Democratic governors.\nThe fact that Whitmer had \u201can opening to make direct appeals\u201d in private to Trump was unique in this political moment, said Matt Grossman, a Michigan State University politics professor.\nIt was her third meeting with Trump at the White House since he took office in January. This one, however, was far less public than the time in April when Whitmer was unwittingly part of an impromptu news conference that embarrassed her so much she covered her face with a folder.\nOn Tuesday, she told the president that the economic damage from the tariffs could be severe in Michigan, a state that helped deliver him the White House in 2024. Whitmer also brought up federal support for recovery efforts after an ice storm and sought to delay changes to Medicaid.\nTrump offered no specific commitments, according to people familiar with the private conversation who were not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke only on condition of anonymity to describe it.\nWhitmer is hardly the only one sounding the warning of the potentially damaging consequences, including factory job losses, lower profits and coming price increases, of the import taxes that Trump has said will be the economic salvation for American manufacturing.\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai said no other president \u201chas taken a greater interest in restoring American auto industry dominance than President Trump.\u201d Trade frameworks negotiated by the administration would open up the Japanese, Korean and European markets for vehicles made on assembly lines in Michigan, Desai said.\nBut the outreach Trump has preferred tends to be splashy presentations by tech CEOs. In the Oval Office on Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave the president a customized glass plaque with a gold base as Cook promised $600 billion in investments. Trump claims to have brought in $17 trillion in investment commitments, although none of those numbers has surfaced yet in economic data.\nUnder his series of executive orders and trade frameworks, U.S. automakers face import taxes of 50% on steel and aluminum, 30% on parts from China and a top rate of 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico not covered under an existing 2020 trade agreement. That puts America\u2019s automakers and parts suppliers at a disadvantage against German, Japanese and South Korean vehicles that only face a 15% import tax negotiated by Trump last month.\nOn top of that, Trump this past week threatened a 100% tariff on computer chips, which are an integral part of cars and trucks, though he would exclude companies that produce chips domestically from the tax.\nWhitmer\u2019s two earlier meetings with Trump resulted in gains for Michigan. But the tariffs represent a significantly broader request of a president who has imposed them even more aggressively in the face of criticism.\nMaterials in the presentation brought by Whitmer to the meeting and obtained by The Associated Press noted how trade with Canada and Mexico has driven $23.2 billion in investment to Michigan since 2020.\nGeneral Motors, Ford, and Stellantis operate 50 factories across the state, while more than 4,000 facilities support the auto parts supply chain. Altogether, the sector supports nearly 600,000 manufacturing jobs, forming the backbone of Michigan\u2019s economy.\nWhitmer outlined the main points of the materials to Trump and left copies with his team.\nTo Grossman, the Michigan State professor, a key question is whether voters who expected to be helped by tariffs would react if Trump\u2019s import taxes failed to deliver the promised economic growth.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s aware that Michigan is a critical swing state and the auto industry has outsized influence, not just directly, but symbolically,\u201d Grossman said.\nAP VoteCast found that Trump won Michigan in 2024 largely because two-thirds of its voters described the economic conditions as being poor or \u201cnot so good.\u201d Roughly 70% of the voters in the state who felt negatively about the economy backed the Republican. The state was essentially split over whether tariffs were a positive, with Trump getting 76% of those voters who viewed them favorably.\nThe heads of General Motors, Ford and Stellantis have repeatedly warned the administration that the tariffs would cut company profits and undermine their global competitiveness. Their efforts have resulted in little more than a temporary, monthlong pause intended to give companies time to adjust. The reprieve did little to blunt the financial fallout.\nIn the second quarter alone, Ford reported $800 million in tariff-related costs, while GM said the import taxes cost it $1.1 billion. Those expenses could make it harder to reinvest in new domestic factories, a goal Trump has championed.\n\u201cWe expect tariffs to be a net headwind of about $2 billion this year, and we\u2019ll continue to monitor the developments closely and engage with policymakers to ensure U.S. autoworkers and customers are not disadvantaged by policy change,\u201d Ford CEO Jim Farley said on his company\u2019s earning call.\nSince Trump returned to the White House, Michigan has lost 7,500 manufacturing jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nSmaller suppliers have felt the strain, too.\nDetroit Axle, a family-run auto parts distributor, has been one of the more vocal companies in Michigan about the impact of the tariffs. The company initially announced it might have to shut down a warehouse and lay off more than 100 workers, but later said it would be able to keep the facility open, at least for now.\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s a market of who is able to survive, it\u2019s not a matter of who can thrive,\u201d said Mike Musheinesh, owner of Detroit Axle."

      "text": "As Trump ramps up attacks on the Federal Reserve, Chair Powell refuses to change course\nAs Trump ramps up attacks on the Federal Reserve, Chair Powell refuses to change course\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday stuck to his position that the central bank will keep its key rate on hold while it waits to see how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs effect the economy, despite the steady stream of criticism from the White House, which wants lower borrowing costs.\nPowell, speaking in Sintra, Portugal, at a conference hosted by the European Central Bank, also said that U.S. inflation is likely to pick up later this summer, though he acknowledged that the timing and magnitude of any price increase from the duties is uncertain. But he said the Fed will keep rates on hold while it evaluates the impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy.\n\u201cAs long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\u201d Powell said, referring to the sweeping duties Trump has imposed this year.\nPowell\u2019s comments underscored the divide between the U.S. central bank\u2019s leader and the Trump administration. Trump has repeatedly urged the Fed to cut its key rate, which he says would save U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars on interest costs on the federal government\u2019s massive debt, and boost the economy. The fight has threatened the Fed\u2019s traditional independence from politics, though since the Supreme Court signaled the president can\u2019t fire the chair, financial markets haven\u2019t responded to Trump\u2019s criticism.\nThe Fed chair also said that without tariffs, the Fed would probably be cutting its key rate right now. The central bank went \u201con hold\u201d after it saw how large Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs were, Powell said, and economists began forecasting higher inflation.\nAt the same time, Powell did not rule out a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s next policy meeting July 29-30.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take any meeting off the table or put it directly on the table,\u201d Powell said. Most economists, however, expect the Fed won\u2019t reduce rates until September at the earliest.\nOn Monday, the president attacked Powell again and extended his criticisms to the entire Fed governing board, which participates in interest-rate decisions.\n\u201cThe board just sits there and watches, so they are equally to blame,\u201d Trump said. The attack on the board ratchets up pressure on individual Fed officials, such as Governor Chris Waller, who have been mentioned as potential successors to Powell, whose term ends in May 2026.\nWhen asked during a panel discussion with other central bankers what keeps him awake at night, Powell referred to the fact that there are just 10 months left in his term.\n\u201cAll I want and all anybody at the Fed wants is to deliver an economy that has price stability, maximum employment, financial stability,\u201d he said.\nPowell was also asked whether Trump\u2019s attacks make his job harder, and he responded, \u201cI\u2019m very focused on just doing my job.\u201d\nThe other central bankers onstage, including Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, Kazuo Ueda, governor of the Bank of Japan, and Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, joined the audience in applauding Powell\u2019s comment.\n\u201cWe would do exactly the same thing as Jay Powell has done,\u201d Lagarde said. \u201cThe same thing.\u201d\nOn Monday, Trump posted a note on social media that listed 44 countries in order of the interest rates set by their central banks. The list showed that Switzerland, Cambodia, and Japan have the lowest short-term rates of 0.25% to 0.5%. \u201cShould be here,\u201d Trump wrote on the list, referring to the Fed.\nYet central banks typically lower their rates when their economies are weaker, to boost borrowing and spending and support growth. The Fed cut its short-term rate to nearly zero during the pandemic for that reason. It rapidly lifted borrowing costs in 2022 and 2023 to combat the worst inflation spike in four decades.\nTrump has been particularly focused on the idea that Fed rate cuts would sharply reduce the government\u2019s borrowing costs.\nYet it\u2019s not necessarily the case that a cut would lower other borrowing costs for things such as mortgages, car loans, or business loans. The short-term rate the Fed controls influences other interest rates, but the markets also play a significant role.\nAs a result, a rate cut by the Fed wouldn\u2019t automatically lower the interest rates paid by Treasury securities, particularly longer-term rates such as the yield on the 10-year Treasury, which strongly affects mortgage rates.\nIn fact, when the Powell Fed first cut its short-term rate last September, the 10-year yield actually rose, lifting mortgage rates and other borrowing costs.\nThe Fed has kept its key short-term interest rate unchanged this year, at about 4.3%, after cutting it three times in 2024.\nAt a news conference in June, Powell suggested that the central bank would \u201clearn a great deal more over the summer\u201d about whether President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs would push up inflation or not. The comment suggested the Fed wouldn\u2019t consider cutting rates until its September meeting.\nYet a few days later, Fed governors Waller and Michelle Bowman, who were both appointed by Trump, said that it was unlikely the tariffs would lead to persistent inflation. Both also indicated that they would likely support reducing the Fed\u2019s rate in July.\nSo far, inflation has mostly continued to cool, despite the imposition of the duties on nearly all U.S. imports. Consumer prices rose just 2.4% in May compared with a year earlier, not far from the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target and much lower than a year ago."

And the unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.2% as Americans dropped out of the labor force and the ranks of the unemployed rose by 221,000.\n\u201cA notable deterioration in U.S. labor market conditions appears to be underway,\u2019' said Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets. \u201dWe have been forecasting this since the tariff and trade war erupted this spring and more restrictive immigration restrictions were put in place. Overall, this report highlights the risk of a harder landing for the labor market.\u2019'\nEconomists have been warning that the rift with every U.S. trading partner will begin to appear this summer and the Friday jobs report appeared to sound the bell.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finally in the eye of the hurricane,\u201d said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at Glassdoor. \u201cAfter months of warning signs, the July jobs report confirms that the slowdown isn\u2019t just approaching\u2014it\u2019s here.\u201d\nU.S. markets recoiled at the jobs report and the Dow tumbled more than 600 points Friday.\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on a sharp slowdown in hiring.\nBut President Donald Trump responded to the weak report by calling for the firing of Erika McEntarfer, the director of the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the jobs numbers. \u201cI have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social. \u201cShe will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified.\u201d\nTrump questioned the big revisions, but they are a standard part of the monthly jobs report. The Labor Department revises its numbers as more data comes in. Particularly since COVID-19, businesses have taken longer to respond to the government\u2019s survey on hiring. As more data has come in later than in the past, the potential for large revisions has increased.\nRevelations in the new data raise questions about the health of the job market and the economy as Trump pushes forward an unorthodox overhaul of American trade policy.\nTrump has discarded decades of U.S. efforts to lower trade barriers globally, instead, imposing hefty import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on products from almost every country on earth. Trump believes the levies will bring manufacturing back to America and raise money to pay for the massive tax cuts he signed into law July 4.\nMainstream economists warned that the cost of the tariffs will be passed along to Americans, both businesses and households.\nThat has begun.\nWalmart, Procter & Gamble, Ford, Best Buy, Adidas, Nike, Mattel, Shein, Temu, Stanley Black & Decker, have all hiked prices due to U.S. tariffs. Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that overseas exporters have absorbed just one-fifth of the rising costs from tariffs, while Americans and U.S. businesses have picked up the lion\u2019s share of the tab.\nTrump has sowed uncertainty in the erratic way he\u2019s rolled the tariffs out \u2014 announcing, then suspending them, then coming up with new ones. Overnight, Trump signed an executive order that set new tariffs on a wide swath of U.S. trading partners to that go into effect on Aug. 7, and that comes after a flurry of unexpected tariff-related actions this week.\n\u201cThere was a clear, significant, immediate, tariff effect on the labor market and employment growth essentially stalled, as we were dealing with so much uncertainty about the outlook for the economy and for tariffs,\u201d said Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist for the brokerage T. Rowe Price.\nStill, Uruci said the data suggests we could be past the worst, as hiring actually did pick up a bit in July from May and June\u2019s depressed levels.\n\u201cI\u2019m not overly pessimistic on the U.S. economy based on this morning\u2019s data,\u201d she said, though she does think that hiring will remain muted in the coming months as the number of available workers remains limited due to reduced immigration and an aging population.\n\u201cBecause of immigration policy, labor supply growth has nearly ground to a halt,\u201d said Guy Berger, senior fellow at the Burning Glass Institute, which studies employment trends. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to have very weak employment growth. And we look like southern Europe or Japan.\u201d\nStill, with fewer workers available, the economy doesn\u2019t need to generate many jobs to soak up the unemployed. That could keep the unemployment rate from climbing much, Berger added.\nTrump has sold the tariffs hikes as a way to boost American manufacturing, but factories cut 11,000 jobs last month after shedding 15,000 in June and 11,000 in May. The federal government, where employment has been targeted by the Trump administration, lost 12,000 jobs. Jobs in administration and support fell by nearly 20,000.\nHealthcare companies added 55,400 jobs last month \u2013 accounting for 76% of the jobs added in July and offering another sign that recent job gains have been narrowly concentrated.\nThe department originally reported that state and local governments had added 64,000 education jobs in June. The revisions Friday slashed those jobs to less than 10,000.\nThose revisions also revealed that the U.S. economy has generated an average of just 85,000 jobs a month this year, barely half last year\u2019s average of 168,000 and well below an average 400,000 from 2021-2023 as the economy rebounded from COVID-19 lockups.\nThe weak jobs data makes it more likely that Trump will get one thing that he most fervently desires: A cut in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve, which often -- though not always -- can lead to lower rates for mortgages, car loans, and credit cards.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have repeatedly pointed to a healthy job market as a reason that they could take time to evaluate how Trump\u2019s tariffs were affecting inflation and the broader economy. Now that assessment has been undercut and will put more pressure on the Fed to reduce borrowing costs.\nWall Street investors sharply raised their expectations for a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September after the report was released.\nOn Wednesday, the Fed left its key rate unchanged for fifth consecutive meeting and Powell signaled little urgency to reduce rates anytime soon. He said the \u201clabor market is solid\u201d with \u201chistorically low unemployment.\u201d But he also acknowledged there is a \u201cdownside risk\u201d to employment stemming from the slow pace of hiring that was evident even before Friday\u2019s weaker numbers.\nThe current situation is a sharp reversal from the hiring boom of just three years ago when desperate employers were handing out signing bonuses and introducing perks such as Fridays off, fertility benefits and even pet insurance to recruit and keep workers.\nThe rate of people quitting their jobs \u2014 a sign they\u2019re confident they can land something better \u2014 has fallen from the record heights of 2021 and 2022 and is now weaker than before the pandemic.\nDrees Homes, a homebuilder based outside Cincinnati in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, has hired about 50 people over the past year, bringing its workforce to around 950. Pamela Rader, Drees\u2019 vice president for human resources, it\u2019s \u201cgotten a little bit easier\u2019\u2019 to find workers.\nA couple of years ago, Rader said jobseekers were focused on getting more pay. Now, she said, they emphasize stable employment, a better work-life balance, and prospects for advancement."

  "argos_summary": "Inflation is expected to rise for the third consecutive month, driven by tariffs on imported goods, complicating the Federal Reserve's potential interest rate cuts. Economists predict a 2.8% increase in consumer prices for July, up from 2.7% in June, with core inflation also expected to rise. The tariffs have led to higher costs for various consumer products, prompting companies like Procter & Gamble and Ford to raise prices, while the job market shows signs of slowing, with hiring significantly down. This economic backdrop creates tension between President Trump, who demands lower rates, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who emphasizes the need for caution amid rising inflation.",
