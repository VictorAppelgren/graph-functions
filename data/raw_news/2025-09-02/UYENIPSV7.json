  "description": "This message is not what it seems \u2014 do not lose your account.",
  "content": "Most people reading this will have a Gmail account and a Facebook account, which makes this a busy week on the security front. Gmail attack warnings are already front and center in most news feeds. And now there\u2019s a new Facebook warning as well.\n\nCourtesy of Kaspersky\u2019s Global Research and Analysis Team, users are being warned that a new threat campaign is disguised as a warning from Facebook itself that your account \u201chas been blocked\u201d or will be suspended after 7 days.\n\nThe message includes an \u201cAppeal\u201d button, which links to a \u201cfraudulent support page.\u201d From there you\u2019re \u2018tricked into downloading malware disguised as an 'appeal\u2019 script.\u201d\n\nThe payload is StealC v2 malware, which can \u201charvest passwords, cookies, cryptocurrency wallet data, and even access screenshots.\u201d Suffice to say, you really don\u2019t want to give the hackers behind these attacks access to that data on your device.\n\nThe attack has started in Asia and is now \u201clikely to begin targeting more countries.\u201d Thus the warning for users in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere to beware the accounts suspension message and the strict instruction not to click that \u2018Appeal\u2019 button.\n\nKaspersky says \u201ccybercriminals often exploit users\u2019 fear of losing account access and a perceived sense of urgency. This pressure can lead individuals to act without caution, increasing the risk of infection by malware such as StealC v2.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhishing attacks can come in many different forms,\u201d Facebook says. \u201cThese links may appear harmless, but they can lead you to dangerous or fraudulent websites that look legitimate, where your personal information or login credentials can be stolen.\u201d\n\nThis malware is a 2025 evolution on the original StealC, and \u201csignificantly enhances the malware\u2019s capabilities and elevates the risk to both individual and corporate users.\u201d\n\nKaspersky\u2019s advice is simple and extends across the board, not just for this latest malware campaign that has been caught in the act:\n\n\u201cLook for urgency or threats. Phishing attempts frequently try to create a sense of urgency or fear. Be cautious of emails demanding immediate action, such as changing a password or providing personal information.\u201d And always \u201cverify unsolicited messages, calls, or links, even if they appear legitimate, and never share 2FA codes.\u201d\n\nThis is the latest such attack, and follows a similar warning last month. Facebook\u2019s advice if your account is hacked can be found here.",

In reality, while that\u2019s inarguably the case there\u2019s also some more bad news for Android overall, just days after Google made its new Pixel 10 the headline act.\nAs reported by Samsung Magazine, this month \u201cSamsung is preparing a huge update, but One UI 8 it won\u2019t be.\u201d And \u201cthe worse news is that this update will preempt One UI 8 but will take a while for it to reach all users,\u201d which may mean even longer delays.\nThis delays Samsung flagship owners getting the same Android 16 security and privacy upgrades that Pixels have now enjoyed for months. This is not a good look for Android, and again highlights the awkward optics of Google competing with OEMs in a battle they can\u2019t win, given Google\u2019s unique position across hardware and software.\nSamMobile has the same warning: \u201cThe next Galaxy S25 update could be a big one,\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s not One UI 8.0, for those wondering.\u201d And while \u201cSamsung is reportedly preparing a big software update for the Galaxy S25 series, it\u2019s not the one everyone\u2019s waiting for.\u201d\nAt the time of writing, we don\u2019t yet know what\u2019s in store for the general Android security bulletin this month or the Samsung specific release. What we do know though, is that Samsung will deploy its firmware patches over several weeks in stark contrast to Google updating Pixels almost immediately after issuing its monthly security bulletin.\nThe latest news follows a post from notable Samsung tipster Tarun Vats on X. \u201cThe last One UI 7 update (September patch) might be quite large, over 1GB+ in size. This will be the final patch before the move to One UI 8.\u201d\nWhat we don\u2019t know yet is whether One UI 8 will creep in before the end of September, as hoped, or it will be October before that upgrade makes its way onto user phones.\n\u201cIt remains to be seen when the rollout will actually begin,\u201d SamMobile says. \u201cFingers crossed it won\u2019t take too long, because the later this monthly update comes, the longer we\u2019ll end up waiting for One UI 8.\u201d"

It is critical you now upgrade the security on your account, as millions have already done.\nThese text messages include a link to a malicious sign-in page that will trick you into entering your user name and password. This then allows an attacker to log into your account, to change your details, buy products, and ultimately steal your money.\nYou must never click links in any text messages \u2014 especially not those that open sign-in pages. And that warning extends beyond texts. Never log into any of your accounts through a link sent to you, even if it seems to come from a legitimate organization.\nThere\u2019s a better way to stay safe. You can upgrade the security on your Amazon account to stop attackers stealing your security credentials. You need to add a passkey now.\nAmazon tells me \u201cmore than 320 million Amazon customers are now using passkeys to experience the convenience of passwordless sign-in on Amazon.com,\u201d and the company is \"committed to expanding their availability across more apps and services.\u201d\nUnder Login $ Security under your Amazon account settings, there is a section where you can check if there\u2019s a passkey on your account and add one if not. This links your account access to the security of your own device, for example the biometrics or PIN on your phone. If an attacker doesn\u2019t have your device, they can\u2019t use your passkey.\nYou should also select a form of two-step verification (2SV) that\u2019s not SMS based, given how vulnerable SMS messages are to socially engineered attacks. An authenticator app is fine. You must still never share passcodes with anyone, even from an app.\nUsing passkeys and authenticator apps stops attackers will only stop attackers accessing your account if you never share passcodes and always use your passkey to login. Even if you were to mistakenly add a password to a fake sign-in page, your account is still safe.\n\u201cWe encourage customers to use two-step verification and Passkeys to help protect their accounts,\u201d Amazon told me, pointing to their sign-up instructions here. That advisory is less than a year old, and reports only 175 million passkey users \u2014 that means passkey has almost doubled in those 12-months. That\u2019s a major shift.\nAs text scams surge, with attackers looking for vulnerable accounts, don\u2019t leave yours exposed. Even if you\u2019re now aware of the latest refund scam, the lure will change and the next one might catch you out. Upgrade your account security now."

      "text": "Zscaler Blog\nGet the latest Zscaler blog updates in your inbox\nSubscribeI StealC You: Tracking the Rapid Changes To StealC\nIntroduction\nStealC is a popular information stealer and malware downloader that has been sold since January 2023. In March 2025, StealC version 2 (V2) was introduced with key updates, including a streamlined command-and-control (C2) communication protocol and the addition of RC4 encryption (in the latest variants). The malware\u2019s payload delivery options have been expanded to include Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) packages and PowerShell scripts. A redesigned control panel provides an integrated builder that enables threat actors to customize payload delivery rules based on geolocation, hardware IDs (HWID), and installed software. Additional features include multi-monitor screenshot capture, a unified file grabber, and server-side brute-forcing for credentials.\nThis blog post focuses on the recent changes in StealC V2, describing the improvements in payload delivery, encryption, control panel functionality, and the updated communication protocol.\nKey Takeaways\n- StealC V2, introduced in March 2025, utilizes a JSON-based network protocol with RC4 encryption implemented in recent variants.\n- StealC V2 now supports loader options that can deliver Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) packages, and PowerShell scripts.\n- The redesigned control panel includes an embedded builder that allows operators to customize payload rules and bot responses based on geolocation, HWID, and installed software.\n- StealC V2 includes multi-monitor screenshot capture and a unified file grabber that targets crypto wallets, gaming applications, instant messengers, email clients, VPNs, and browsers. In addition, StealC V2 supports server-side brute-forcing capabilities for credential harvesting.\n- ThreatLabz has observed StealC V2 being deployed via Amadey, and conversely, it being used to distribute StealC V2.\nTechnical Analysis\nA thorough technical analysis of StealC V2 was published by another researcher. However, in the following sections, we delve into additional technical information that complements prior open source reporting.\nSimilar to StealC V1, many StealC V2 samples are packed using Themida, a commercial code protection tool, which is designed to hinder reverse engineering. Additionally, the malware obfuscates nearly all the strings it uses during execution and employs a two-stage deobfuscation process, which was also observed in StealC V1.\nThe following matrix shows a comparison between features available in StealC V1 and StealC V2.\nStealC Version 1 | StealC Version 2 | |\n|---|---|---|\nAnti-VM checks | Yes | No |\nSupports specifying a custom port or using HTTPS | Yes | No |\nEstablishes persistence | No | No |\nDownloads third-party DLLs from the C2 server | Yes | No |\nExecutes DLL payloads | Yes | No |\nExecutes EXE payloads | Yes | Yes |\nExecutes MSI files payloads | No | Yes |\nExecutes PowerShell script payloads | No | Yes |\nCompiled for x64 architectures | No | Yes |\nUses RC4 encryption for network communications | No | Yes (implemented in 2.1.1) |\nDecrypts stolen data server-side | No | Yes |\nSupports Chrome v20 application bound encryption | No | Yes |\nEnables victim screenshot capture with multi-monitor support | No | Yes |\nSupports unified file grabber functionality | No | Yes |\nStreamlines and improves the control panel with an integrated builder | No | Yes |\nTable 1: A matrix comparing features available in StealC V1 and StealC V2.\nDuring the initial execution, StealC V2 decrypts important strings using a hardcoded RC4 key, along with an expiration date and information required for API resolution. If the current date is past the expiration date, the malware will terminate itself. The malware\u2019s strings are stored in Base64 format and decrypted using RC4 encryption with a unique hardcoded key. Although the hardcoded keys may vary between samples, the builder integrated into the control panel does not change this RC4 key. Instead, the StealC V2 support team manages key updates for their clients as we will discuss later.\nStealC V2 performs several validation steps in addition to the expiration date, including ensuring no duplicate instances are running, and the system language cannot be a language spoken in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). At this point, the second deobfuscation routine takes place, decoding configuration strings such as the host and URL path of the C2 server, along with additional API DLLs and function names for future use during execution.\nThose API functions are contained in the DLLs below:\n- kernel32.dll\n- advapi32.dll\n- gdiplus.dll\n- crypt32.dll\n- gdi32.dll\n- rstrtmgr.dll\n- ole32.dll\n- winhttp.dll\n- user32.dll\n- shlwapi.dll\n- shell32.dll\n- ntdll.dll\n- nss3.dll\n- wininet.dll\nNotably, unlike V1, StealC V2 does not include strings related to virtual machine environments. StealC V2 also no longer makes requests to the C2 server to download third-party DLLs that were required for information stealing functionality.\nNew features\nStealC V1 was capable of executing EXE and DLL files. StealC V2 now supports downloading and executing payloads in three formats: executable (EXE) files, Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) packages, and PowerShell scripts. Depending on the loader configuration parameter provided by the C2 server in the initial response, this functionality can be triggered either before or after the data-stealing functions. The table below describes how each payload is executed.\nPayload Type | Execution Method |\n|---|---|\nEXE files | Executed using the Windows API function ShellExecuteEx with up to 10 retry attempts if execution fails. |\nMSI files | Installed using msiexec.exe with the silent |\nPowerShell scripts | Executes a remote PowerShell script via the |\nTable 2: New payload execution types supported by StealC V2.\nRC4 encryption\nInterestingly, the RC4 encryption functionality was initially commented out in early versions of StealC V2. The most recent update has enabled RC4 encryption, indicating that malware is under active development.\nUpdated network communication protocol\nStealC V2 utilizes standard JSON-based requests and responses for its C2 communication. The figure below illustrates the workflow of the C2 communication process.\nFigure 1: Shows StealC V2\u2019s communications workflow.\nRequest\nThe C2 server accepts four operation types: create\n, upload_file\n, done\n, and loader\n. The create\noperation is always the first request, which registers the infection. The initial request always contains a bot ID (HWID) and the botnet ID (build\n), as shown in the example below.\n{\nbuild: \"main1\",\nhwid: \"A9CAA24C-E7F3-3B20-0F54-4BE8A7DC2330\",\ntype: \"create\"\n}\nThe HWID creation is based on the volume serial number from the system\u2019s drive letter (or C: by default) and consists of 32 hexadecimal characters in a UUIDv4 format.\nResponse\nThe response from the C2 server contains essential elements that define the malware\u2019s behavior and operational tasks. It includes the access_token\n, which the malware uses for all subsequent requests, as well as flags that specify target configurations, such as browser settings for data theft, crypto plugins for search and exfiltration, and files to target (e.g., cryptocurrency wallets, Steam, Outlook). Steam and Outlook paths are hardcoded into the binary, and their data is exfiltrated if the corresponding flags are enabled.\nOne notable feature in the C2 server's response is the inclusion of a random parameter, which adds variability to each message. This string consists of hexadecimal characters and ranges from 10 to 15 hexadecimal lowercase characters in length (e.g., c689cbd9ecfa3cc\nin the example below). This random key-value pair plays a critical role for RC4 encrypted messages that ensures that each message is unique (even though the same encryption key is repeatedly used). This technique is used to avoid static signatures for the responses.\nAn example response is shown below:\n{\n8b31887be2030b7: \"c689cbd9ecfa3cc\",\nopcode: \"success\",\naccess_token: \"f066fcda843438[..]f666733c11901ae74102df\",\nself_delete: 1,\ntake_screenshot: 1,\nloader: 0,\nsteal_steam: 0,\nsteal_outlook: 1,\nbrowsers: [],\nplugins: [],\nfiles: []\n}\nEach response contains an opcode\nfield that indicates the result of the request, such as success\n, blocked\n, error\n, or unknown\n, which are described in the next section.\nBased on the panel files, a StealC V2 server generates specific error codes when it detects malformed or unexpected requests. By comparison, a StealC V1 server responded with an empty message, a block\nnotification, or terminated the connection. The following table outlines the StealC V2 error codes and the conditions under which they are triggered.\nRequest | Explanation | Response |\n|---|---|---|\nAny request | Malformed message (not JSON compliant) | {\u201copcode\u201d: \u201cerror\u201d, \u201ccode\u201d: \u201c1000\u201d} |\nAny request | Unknown packet (unknown type parameter) | {\u201copcode\u201d: \u201cunknown\u201d} |\nAny request | Empty parameter or not present | {\u201copcode\u201d: \u201cerror\u201d} |\nAny request | Unencrypted message (after version 2.0.1) | {\u201copcode\u201d: \u201cblock\u201d} |\n| Empty access token | {\u201copcode\u201d: \u201cerror5\u201d} |\n| Filename or data parameters not present | {\u201copcode\u201d: \u201cerror4\u201d} |\n| Malformed or unknown access token | {\u201copcode\u201d: \u201cerror1\u201d} |\n| File was already sent by the bot | {\u201copcode\u201d: \u201cerror3\u201d} |\n| Server couldn\u2019t store file | {\u201copcode\u201d: \u201cerror2\u201d} |\n| Empty parameter or not present | {\u201copcode\u201d: \u201cerror\u201d} |\n| Already finished communication process or blocked IP | {\u201copcode\u201d: \u201cblocked\u201d} |\n| Unable to register bot | {\u201copcode\u201d: \u201cerror\u201d} |\nTable 3: Error codes sent by the StealC V2 C2 server when an unexpected or malformed request is received.\nControl panel and builder\nThreatLabz analyzed a StealC V2 C2 panel with an embedded builder as shown in the figure below.\nFigure 2: The StealC V2 control panel dashboard provides a summary of infection activity and stolen information.\nThreatLabz\u2019s in-depth analysis of StealC V2\u2019s infrastructure revealed several key findings:\n- Version control enforcement: The builder requires a version update that is provided in a ZIP archive to be uploaded via the framework's admin settings. This ensures that operators cannot install older versions than the most recently applied update.\n- Telegram bot integration: The control panel supports Telegram bot integration for sending notifications and allows customization of message formats.\n- Rule-based payload delivery: Payload delivery depends on rules created by the operator, such as bot geolocation, build IDs, markers triggered, or identified software/processes during the information-gathering phase. These rules dictate how payload responses are generated.\n- Ongoing development: The panel is rapidly evolving, with partially implemented features like Firefox plugin loading. As previously mentioned RC4 encryption for network communication was initially commented-out. The recently released update (version 2.2.0) enabled RC4 encryption for network communications.\n- Endpoint file handling: The control panel endpoint supports file-based uploads (e.g., multipart/form-data) similar to StealC V1 but now exclusively processes\nupload_file\ncommands. - IP and HWID-based blocking: The panel allows operators to block communications based on IP addresses (or IP masks) and specific HWIDs. Additionally, IP addresses can be automatically blocked for the remainder of the day after completing the communication process.\n- Fake 404 error for C2 discovery evasion: Early versions of the panel served fake 404 Not Found pages. However, a researcher noticed this fake response could be used to easily detect StealC V2 servers, and newer updates reportedly patched this behavior.\n- Basic RC4 implementation: Despite the first StealC V2 advertisement claiming to implement a custom RC4 algorithm, the RC4 implementation used is standard.\nThe StealC V2 builder is embedded into the control panel interface, enabling operators to define loader rules, grabber rules, and markers (markers consist of wildcards that will be triggered if the content of the stolen passwords or cookies files match) for stolen data. For example, the threat actor could create a marker searching for strings containing coinbase.com in the contents of the exfiltrated password and cookies files as shown below.\nFigure 3: StealC V2 Marker rule which will search for coinbase.com.\nThen the actor can then create a loader rule that will be triggered when the marker matches. So if the victim\u2019s files contain the marker\u2019s search terms, the C2 will answer to the loader request with the triggered loader\u2019s URL as shown in the figure below.\nFigure 4: StealC V2 loader rule creation which will trigger when the Coinbase Marker matches.\nThese custom configurations are automatically merged with a build template file, which is a pre-configured StealC V2 binary.The builder only modifies the build\nparameter from the build template, leaving the build_id\nparameter in plaintext and set to the default value across all templates. Important elements such as the RC4 key, C2 address, and URL path are exclusively managed by the StealC V2 development team. Note that StealC V2 currently only supports HTTP communication on port 80.\nUpdates\nThe figure below shows the update interface in StealC V2\u2019s control panel.\nFigure 5: StealC V2\u2019s panel and builder update menu (with two updates applied).\nAfter the StealC V2 control panel is set up, the installer script instructs the operator to contact support (the StealC seller) and send the control panel domain, the path for network communication, and the RC4 key created at install time. After receiving these parameters, the seller creates an update containing a builder template binary configured with the parameters from the installation script. Once the operator receives the builder template, they can use the control panel to create new StealC builds.\nThe update file is packaged as a ZIP archive containing the following components:\n- version.json: JSON file used by the panel to identify and install the update.\n- build.exe: StealC V2 template binary.\n- Optional patch files: Additional files that can replace specific existing files in the panel during the update process, ensuring seamless integration of new functionality or fixes.\nThe example below shows the contents of a version.json\nfile. This file contains update information, which is read by the panel to identify and apply the changes included in the update.\n{\n\"version\": \"2.2.4\",\n\"admin_update\": true,\n\"gate_update\": true,\n\"db_update\": false,\n\"changes\":\n[\n{\"type\": \"gate\", \"description\": \"Fix build block requests v2\"}\n]\n}\nThe table below describes fields inside the version.json\nfile:\nField | Description |\n|---|---|\n| The StealC V2 bot version. |\n| A flag that instructs the updater to apply patches to the admin structure folder. |\n| A flag that directs the updater to apply patches to the gate structure folder. |\n| A list of update messages detailing modifications, displayed within the panel. |\n| Indicates updates or modifications to the panel's database model, specifically MySQL. |\nTable 4: Parameters present in StealC V2\u2019s update configuration file.\nComparing StealC builds\nAfter examining the builder templates included in the C2 panel, we compared different versions and identified key improvements in their development. The table below highlights the evolution of StealC across versions:\nTemplate Version | Update File | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n2.0.1 |\n|\n|\n2.0.1 |\n|\n|\n2.1.1 |\n|\n|\n2.1.3 |\n|\n|\n2.2.4 |\n|\n|\nTable 5: Differences among the StealC V2 bot templates present in several update files.\nAdditionally, the latest version includes a self-delete routine, triggered based on the configuration flag (self_delete\n) received from the C2 server, which is very similar to the routine that StealC V1 used to erase the downloaded DLLs.\nConclusion\nStealC V2 introduces improvements, such as enhanced payload delivery, a streamlined communications protocol with encryption, and a redesigned control panel that provides more targeted information collection. StealC V2 is frequently used in conjunction with other malware families such as Amadey. ThreatLabz is continuing to track updates to StealC V2 and adding coverage to protect our customers.\nZscaler Coverage\nZscaler\u2019s multilayered cloud security platform detects indicators related to the new variant of StealC V2 at various levels.

      "text": "Republished on July 31 with new text attack warnings for all smartphone users.\nThe FBI warns that \u201cmalicious actors\u201d continue to send fraudulent texts and voice messages to \u201cgain access to personal accounts.\u201d Do not reply to messages unless you recognize the sender\u2019s number. But there\u2019s more you must do to safeguard accounts.\nAmerica is under attack from a malicious texting industry sending out billions of messages. Whether undelivered packages, unpaid tolls and DMV fines or Amazon refunds, the objective is to steal your data, your money, even your identity.\nBut sometimes even legitimate texts can be dangerous.\nWe\u2019re talking two-factor authentication (2FA), which the bureau says you should set up \u201con any account that allows it,\u201d and should \u201cnever disable.\u201d But most 2FA codes are delivered by text. And the problem with texts is that you can send them on to others.\nNever do that, the FBI warns \u2014 regardless of who\u2019s asking.\n\u201cActors may use social engineering techniques to convince you to disclose a 2FA code,\u201d the bureau says in an advisory reshared this week. Doing so lets attackers \u201ccompromise and take over accounts.\u201d Even if the request comes from someone you know, \u201cnever provide a two-factor code to anyone over email, SMS/MMS or encrypted messaging.\u201d\nESET\u2019s Jake Moore warns the same. \u201cScammers often trick people into revealing them to bypass security checks and take control so even if someone claims to be from your bank, trusted company or even a family member, keep OTPs to yourself.\u201d\nThis all sounds very basic. But if an attacker hijacks one of your friend\u2019s messaging accounts, they can pretend to be your friend and ask you to send a code, telling you their phone is not working. The scam is remarkably effective.\nWhile you should never share OTP text messages, you can better protect yourself if you stop using them altogether. Use an authenticator app, or better still use a passkey. This links your account to your physical device, making it impossible to steal and use a code.\nShifting from SMS to authenticator apps or passkeys is critical now SMS interception and bypass is more common. Per Cybersecurity News, \u201ccriminal enterprises no longer require extensive technical expertise to deploy advanced mobile threats, as ready-to-use malware kits are now available for subscription fees as low as $300 per month.\u201d\nBanks in Australia and UAE are already calling time on SMS 2FA codes, and you should now do the same. But if you are using those codes, it\u2019s even more critical that you never share them, regardless of who is who\u2019s asking and the reason they\u2019re giving.\nWhile SMS persists, Cybersecurity News warns of a \u201cfundamental shift toward industrialized cybercrime, where specialized providers handle technical complexities while criminal customers focus solely on victim targeting and monetization strategies.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t new. Per one warning from 2021, while \u201cfigures suggest users who enabled 2FA ended up blocking about 99.9% of automated attacks, as with any good cybersecurity solution, attackers can quickly come up with ways to circumvent it. They can bypass 2FA through the one-time codes sent as an SMS to a user\u2019s smartphone.\u201d\nAnd the warnings keep coming. \u201cAs attack methods become more sophisticated,\u201d Cyber News has just warned, \u201chackers have discovered multiple ways to bypass 2FA when the authentication method consists of one-time codes sent as an SMS message. There are many terrifying ways to easily trick users into unwittingly downloading malware onto their device or perform a socially engineered SIM swap fraud.\u201d\nExamples of such attacks include Coinbase, where where \u201cseveral techniques to overcome SIM 2FA and drain accounts of 6,000 consumers. T-Mobile's recent data breach should also be a warning to customers who are using SMS for two-factor authentication. The attack reportedly leaked IMEI and IMSI information which compromises the security of SMS-based two-factor authentication.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s 2FA code bypass, interception or socially engineered thefts that have fueled many of the recent headline ransomware attacks, where support staff have been tricked into disclosing codes, which opens up initial access to systems.\nAs Google now warns, \u201cover the past year, defenders have been facing heightened pressure,\" as \u201cattackers intensify their phishing and credential theft methods, which drive 37% of successful intrusions,\u201d and that includes 2FA attacks.\nOne such example is Scattered Spider, of course, where \"threat actors use multiple social engineering techniques \u2014 including push bombing \u2014 and subscriber identity module (SIM) swap attacks, to obtain credentials, install remote access tools, and/or bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA), the bureau has warned.\n\u201cDo not use SMS as a second factor for authentication,\u201d CISA, the U.S. cyber defense agency warns. \u201cSMS messages are not encrypted \u2014 a threat actor with access to a telecommunication provider\u2019s network who intercepts these messages can read them. SMS MFA is not phishing-resistant and is therefore not strong authentication for accounts of highly targeted individuals.\u201d\nThat said, CISA also notes the challenge where \u201csome online services may default to SMS during account recovery flows,\u201d and so \u201cit may not be feasible for you to completely eliminate SMS messages from the service.\u201d But where you can, you really should."

      "text": "In a surprise move, a Google update has just slammed viral headlines warning of a mass Gmail data breach as \u201centirely false.\u201d Google and Gmail newsfeeds have been littered for days with stories suggesting a warning has been issued from 2.5 billion. It\u2019s not true. But Google also issued some critical advice for users on protecting their accounts.\nGoogle\u2019s almost unprecedented decision to warn all 2.5 billion Gmail users to ignore headline claims (1,2,3) of a mass data breach was prompted by the news getting \u201cout of hand.\u201d Prior to Google\u2019s update, the fake news showed little sign of slowing down.\nIn a Workspace blog On Monday, Google posted that \u201cseveral inaccurate claims surfaced recently that incorrectly stated that we issued a broad warning to all Gmail users about a major Gmail security issue. This is entirely false.\u201d\nBut Google also cautioned users that \u201cit\u2019s always the case that phishers are looking for ways to infiltrate inboxes,\u201d assuring that \u201cour protections continue to block more than 99.9% of phishing and malware attempts from reaching users.\u201d\nThe blog came a day after Google told me \u201cseveral inaccurate claims surfaced this week incorrectly claiming we issued a broad warning to all Gmail users about a major Gmail security issue. This is entirely false.\u201d But two days later, even Google News still brands the story as \u201cGoogle warns Gmail users of data breach, urges password changes.\u201d\nThe danger in conflating different stories into a data breach that never was is that users become inured to the real advice. It\u2019s true that most Google account holders do not update passwords regularly \u2014 which they should. And it\u2019s also true that most Gmail users should add passkeys to their email and other accounts.\nGoogle reiterated this advice in its fake news update: \u201cFor additional protection, we encourage users to use a secure password alternative like passkeys.\u201d It would be good to think that some good will come out of this furor. And if millions more of Gmail\u2019s 2.5 billion users take this opportunity to add passkeys, it will be worth it.\nGoogle\u2019s own research says only 34% of U.S. account holders use passkeys. And so perhaps that\u2019s the real critical update from Google here \u2014 to add a passkey now, rather than the short-term news cycle which will fade within days and soon be forgotten.\nAs ever with passkey advice, it\u2019s also imperative to remind users that even if you add a passkey, your password remains a vulnerability if it provides access to your account. That\u2019s why Microsoft and others recommend deleting passwords, albeit Google isn\u2019t there yet. Make sure your password is strong and unique and that you enable two-step verification using something other than SMS. An authenticator app is fine."

      "text": "Facebook accounts are under attack as bad actors \u201ctry to steal your login information or to infect your device with malware.\u201d And when bad actors \u201ctake control over an account or device,\u201d they may target \u201cother people you may know, including friends or family.\u201d\nThat Facebook advice is now front and center again as MalwareBytes warns a new attack has crafted \u201can email saying that your Facebook account was logged into from a new device\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019ve received a request to reset your password for Facebook Account!\u201d\nJust as with Google, Apple and Microsoft, emails that purport to come from Facebook with account or security related alerts are likely account attacks. These messages will include links or attachments that must not be clicked. Delete the messages.\n\u201cPhishing attacks can come in many different forms,\u201d Facebook says. \u201cThese links may appear harmless, but they can lead you to dangerous or fraudulent websites that look legitimate, where your personal information or login credentials can be stolen.\u201d\nThese links come in emails, texts or posts. \u201cYou read a post on Facebook from someone you think you know,\u201d but when \u201cyou click the link, you are taken to a fake Facebook login page where you unknowingly give your account credentials to scammers.\u201d\nIn the latest password attack discovered by MalwareBytes, \u201call the links you see in the email: \u2018Report the user\u2019, \u2018Yes, me\u2019, \u2018unsubscribe\u2019, and even the obfuscated email address at the bottom, do exactly the same thing. They open your default email program with a pre-addressed message with a subject line that matches the button/text you clicked on.\u201d\nAll such attacks will eventually lead to a fake login page that steals usernames and passwords and sometimes two-factor authentication codes, or will trick you into downloading an attachment or app, which then installs malware on your device.\nBecause this attack lures you into sending an email, MalwareBytes reminds Facebook users to \u201cscrutinize the destination of an email link. Even if the domain looks legitimate, your Facebook account isn\u2019t secured by a shoe maker or vacation provider, or someone using a gmail address. The email address should belong to Facebook or Meta.\u201d\nIf your account has been hijacked or compromised, Facebook says you might see the following warning signs:\n- \u201cYou can\u2019t access your Facebook account.\n- Your friends or family tell you that they are receiving inappropriate messages, videos, or images from your account.\n- You are now following people or pages you don\u2019t want to follow.\u201d\nMeanwhile, just as with the latest campaign, the social media giant says you should look out for messages crafted to trick you into reacting urgently, such as \u201cthreats or urgent demands, like \u2018do this now or we\u2019ll close your account\u2019, asking for passwords, account details, or other personal information, or language that urges you to click on a link.\u201d\nWhile any message with such warnings or calls to actions are almost certainly scams, Facebook advises that any emails it sends will come from one of these addresses: fb.com, facebook.com, facebookmail.com, meta.com, metamail.com.\u201d"
