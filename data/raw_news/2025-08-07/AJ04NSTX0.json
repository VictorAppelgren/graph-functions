  "title": "IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Just Beat Earnings Expectations: Here's What Analysts Think Will Happen Next",
  "description": "NasdaqGS:IDXX 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore IDEXX Laboratories's Fair Values from the Community and select...",
  "content": "Explore IDEXX Laboratories's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\n\n\nIDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDXX) investors will be delighted, with the company turning in some strong numbers with its latest results. It was overall a positive result, with revenues beating expectations by 4.0% to hit US$1.1b. IDEXX Laboratories reported statutory earnings per share (EPS) US$3.63, which was a notable 10% above what the analysts had forecast. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nAfter the latest results, the twelve analysts covering IDEXX Laboratories are now predicting revenues of US$4.23b in 2025. If met, this would reflect a satisfactory 4.7% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to rise 2.2% to US$12.59. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$4.15b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$12.21 in 2025. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\n\nSee our latest analysis for IDEXX Laboratories\n\nThe consensus price target rose 24% to US$674, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values IDEXX Laboratories at US$785 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$420. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.\n\nThese estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the IDEXX Laboratories' past performance and to peers in the same industry. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 9.5% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 8.4% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 8.2% annually. So although IDEXX Laboratories is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's only growing at about the rate of the wider industry.",

The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$313.3b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$152.78\n7D\n-0.5%\n1Y\n7.3%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$72.0b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$58.64\n7D\n-1.0%\n1Y\n36.4%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$62.3b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$26.75\n7D\n-4.5%\n1Y\n28.6%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$53.1b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$235.91\n7D\n1.1%\n1Y\n32.8%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$51.4b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$162.44\n7D\n-4.9%\n1Y\n-4.1%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$47.7b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$75.23\n7D\n-8.5%\n1Y\n-9.4%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.5b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$104.33\n7D\n2.9%\n1Y\n44.7%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.9b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$18.68\n7D\n9.0%\n1Y\n35.3%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.8b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$41.79\n7D\n-2.1%\n1Y\n17.2%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.7b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$41.54\n7D\n-2.7%\n1Y\n3.2%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$2.8b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$22.73\n7D\n-7.7%\n1Y\n-37.6%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.6b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$27.09\n7D\n-15.3%\n1Y\n12.4%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.3b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$20.04\n7D\n-12.5%\n1Y\n-0.4%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$457.4m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$2.03\n7D\n-0.5%\n1Y\n-16.1%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$405.7m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.36\n7D\n0%\n1Y\n-35.5%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$306.3m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$24.91\n7D\n-2.5%\n1Y\n-30.9%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$89.8m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$4.80\n7D\n0%\n1Y\n23.4%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$48.2m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$0.99\n7D\n-4.4%\n1Y\n-49.5%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$526.1k\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0013\n7D\n18.2%\n1Y\n-81.9%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a"
