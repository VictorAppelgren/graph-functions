      "feedback": "The draft is too long and unfocused for a 4–6 sentence executive brief; tighten it into a Ford-centric house view with a clear base/bull/bear map and explicit triggers. Actionable edits: (1) confine to 4–6 sentences, building a tight causal chain where Model E EBIT and EV gross margins drive ROIC versus WACC, which then sets the discount rate/valuation, rather than a broad multi-asset regime narrative; (2) ground in first principles by specifying Model E EBIT breakeven, the EV gross margin needed for ROIC > WACC, and how ICE/Pro cash flows offset EV losses; (3) quantify Ford-specific numbers from the sources (EV Q2 loss $1.3B; overall margin ~4.3%; ROIC ~10.1%; 2014–2024 revenue CAGR ~2.5%; deferment of up to $12B EV capex; forward P/E 8–10x; ~5% yield) and tie them to a disciplined mid-cycle value anchor around 9x with a defensible cash-flow path; (4) trim or relocate non-Ford macro/private-market sections, citing only Ford-relevant sources (W2622L6WW, 22PL3Q360) to avoid dilution of the investing thesis; and (5) add explicit catalysts and invalidation points (e.g., Model E EBITDA turns positive within 2–3 quarters and EV margins stabilize, tariff trajectory neutralizes, or a sustained demand downturn would invalidate the bull/base cases), plus a concise 3–4 item watchlist to guide monitoring.",
