  "title": "Why Gaming's Most Influential Series Is a Game You've Never Heard Of",
  "description": "Some of your favorite games owe their existence to this niche bullet hell shooter.",
  "content": "You've probably never heard of the Touhou Project series. Even if you have, there's a good chance you haven't played any of the games. Although the series has always been stuck in the confines of its cult classic status, Touhou has played a monumental role in shaping the modern gaming landscape, and many of your favorite games wouldn't exist without it.\n\nTouhou Project\u2014better known as just \"Touhou\"\u2014is an indie bullet hell series created by solo-developer Jun'ya \u014cta (known to fans as \"ZUN\"). The series originally debuted in 1997 on PC-98 systems with Touhou Reiiden ~ The Highly Responsive to Prayers, a mostly bog-standard Breakout clone with a few creative gameplay twists inspired by retro shoot 'em ups. It wasn't until the second game\u2014Touhou Fuumaroku ~ the Story of Eastern Wonderland\u2014that the series' identity truly began to take shape.\n\nBeginning with the Story of Eastern Wonderland, most Touhou games have been frantically fast-paced and immensely difficult bullet hell shooters. Each entry has you flying through a series of challenging stages, shooting down waves of airborne enemies and narrowly avoiding bullets until you reach a boss fight at the end of each level.\n\nWhile you're dodging bullets, you'll also strengthen your own magical projectiles by gathering power-ups from defeated enemies. Fully-upgrading your firepower can turn some stages into a breeze, but it's never enough to make any of Touhou's boss battles feel like pushovers. Every boss attacks with uniquely tricky bullet patterns that will test your reflexes and memorization. At various points during their fights, boss characters can also activate \"spell cards,\" special attacks that flood the screen with a continuous stream of bullets.\n\nThankfully, you can also strike back with your own spell cards to obliterate a large chunk of their health bars. Later Touhou games introduced the \"graze\" mechanic, which allows you to raise your score by narrowly avoiding\u2014or \"grazing\"\u2014enemy projectiles. Some of the sequels have shaken up this formula with the additions of new playable characters and creative gimmicks, but you can always expect to find the same style of bullet hell goodness in each entry.\n\nUnlike many earlier bullet hell games, Touhou places its world and characters at the forefront of each game. Every Touhou story takes place in the mystical land of Gensokyo, where humans and mythological creatures known as \"youkai\" live together in harmony... at least, for the most part. While the series features multiple protagonists, most Touhou games follow a powerful human shrine maiden named Reimu Hakurei, who frequently finds herself being dragged into various incidents to stop the youkai from stirring up trouble.\n\nTouhou's stories rarely take themselves seriously and often fit into a very formulaic structure: Reimu faces off against a roster of new characters and familiar faces in a series of bullet hell battles, occasionally drops blatant death threats (especially in the early entries; PC-98 Reimu was oddly bloodthirsty), and beats some sense into the big-bad at the very end.\n\nDespite their simplicity, the series' eccentric cast of characters and endlessly imaginative conflicts are always a joy to experience. Whether you're following Reimu (or one of the other playable protags) as she stops a family of vampires from trapping Gensokyo in an endless night, investigates the sudden appearance of a mysterious UFO, or interferes in a war between an army of fairies and a secret society living on the moon, it's surprisingly easy to get invested in the lighthearted adventures of Touhou.\n\nOver the years, the Touhou franchise has expanded into fighting games, rhythm games, and even a few photography-themed spinoffs. There's a lot more to Touhou beyond the original bullet hell shooters, but its influence on gaming as a whole begins with the franchise's earliest entries.\n\nTouhou Was the Original Face of Indie Games\n\nThe late 90s and early 2000s marked a rough time for indie studios and solo developers. In contrast to the 80s and early 90s\u2014which saw many small studios build themselves up through shareware and moderate successes\u2014the rise of game consoles and rapid commercialization of the gaming industry allowed AAA releases to easily eclipse lower-budget titles.\n\nDuring this time, indie game development began to seem less viable as a career. At best, self-published games were a potential gateway to being hired at a larger studio, but many solo devs pursued indie game development as a hobby, first and foremost. This was also the case for ZUN, who developed Highly Responsive to Prayers as a way to practice his programming and music composition skills while attending college. The series' PC-98 titles were only sold at Comiket Market\u2014a Tokyo-based convention where independent creators can sell self-published works\u2014with the first two games selling less than 100 copies, combined.\n\nHowever, Touhou quickly attracted a small fanbase with each new installment. Over the course of the series' PC-98 games, all five of which were released between 1997 and '98, the series' climbed from tens to hundreds of copies being sold per game. After a brief hiatus, during which ZUN graduated from college and began working at Taito, he returned to the series in 2002 with Touhou Koumakyou ~ The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil.\n\nBesides being the first game released for Windows, the sixth game is also where ZUN refined Touhou into a masterclass in bullet hell design. Many fan-favorite levels, characters, songs, and game mechanics were introduced in The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. The game went on to sell thousands of copies and helped cement the Touhou series as a true cult classic.\n\nTouhou certainly wasn't the first indie game to see this type of success, though most of those other successes\u2014at least in Japan\u2014were dating sims or other types of visual novels. Touhou was an obvious outlier, which made it all the more surprising when it single-handedly revitalized the bullet hell genre, inspiring many games that modeled themselves after the series' unique mechanics and cutesy anime aesthetic.\n\nIn many ways, Touhou was the underdog story that indie developers needed during the early 2000s. While it was far from a mainstream hit, the Touhou series proved to be much more successful than anyone would have expected from a solo-developed bullet hell shooter. A few years after The Embodiment of the Scarlet Devil, we started to see more games created by small teams and solo developers, such as Cave Story in 2004, Darwinia in 2005, and Dwarf Fortress in 2006. Between these releases, there were also hundreds of lesser-known indie games that never received the same level of attention as Touhou, but still showed that the series had inspired independent creators to break out of their shells.\n\nTo be fair, Touhou wasn't the only thing that helped spark the indie game resurgence. Around the same time, Valve launched Steam\u2014everyone's favorite PC storefront\u2014and Flash games had just begun to populate the web. However, Touhou was the first major indie release of the 2000s to prove that passionate creators were still capable of making a name for themselves without the help of a larger studio.\n\nIt's not hard to understand why the Touhou series attracted a cult following in Japan, but the series' evolution into a global success is a lot more bizarre. None of the Touhou games were ever officially released outside of Japan, and most fans of the series have never even tried its games. That may sound confusing at first, but Touhou's popularity begins to make more sense when you consider the era of its release.\n\nTouhou owes much of its success to the rise of internet fandoms. Ever since The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, the Touhou series has been a magnet for fan art, song covers, online videos, and just about every other type of fanwork imaginable. As Touhou's online influence became more widespread, people unfamiliar with the series were drawn into the Touhou fandom thanks to the series' iconic characters and amazing soundtracks.\n\nIt didn't matter if they even knew about the original games; many early internet denizens were exposed to the series through its inescapable presence on forums and video-sharing sites like YouTube or Nico Nico Douga. In those days, it wasn't rare for videos or songs you found online to somehow be connected to the Touhou fanbase. Personally, a video of someone playing \"Night of Nights\" (a boss theme from Embodiment of Scarlet Devil) on their phone's keypad ended up being my gateway into bullet hell.\n\nTouhou is one of the rare cases of a series' fanbase eclipsing the official releases. There are countless unofficial games, comics, anime adaptations, merchandise, and fan conventions dedicated to the Touhou series. Unless you are already familiar with the mainline series, you probably wouldn't even realize that nearly all the most popular works associated with Touhou are entirely fanmade. Even Touhou games that received international console ports and videos with millions of views are usually made by fans.\n\nWhile it often overshadows ZUN's work, Touhou's fanbase is the series' greatest strength. It has brought more people into the series than the original games could have ever reached on their own, and allowed Touhou to explore all sorts of genres and different mediums. That's not to disregard the official games\u2014they're still going strong with the 20th mainline entry arriving later this month\u2014but much of Touhou's current identity and cultural relevance stems from its community. Today, Touhou embodies far more than a niche series of bullet hell games, and that wouldn't have ever happened without its devout fanbase.\n\nIn the same way that Touhou once represented what indie games could be, it's also become a shining example of what more game series should be. Part of the reason Touhou's fan community blossomed the way it did was largely due to its creator's willingness to support fan projects. Unlike many modern game companies\u2014especially those whose names start with \"Nin\" and end with \"Tendo\"\u2014ZUN has always embraced the Touhou fanbase's creativity, even allowing indie creators to monetize their fanmade projects based on the series.\n\nBecause of this, fans have been able to reimagine Touhou in other genres and concepts that the official releases probably never would. It's also allowed other creators to turn their love for the series into original works unashamedly inspired by Touhou, including the massively popular Undertale and Deltarune.\n\nToday, many gaming companies are more protective of their IPs than ever before, even when it's detrimental to the rest of the gaming industry. While it makes sense for them not to encourage cheap knock-offs or blatant bootlegs, it's obvious that companies aren't solely interested in protecting their reputation when they start attacking fan remakes like AM2R, competitors like Palworld, or entire fangame archives on websites like Gamejolt.\n\nMeanwhile, Touhou's fangames include everything from kart racers, Metroidvanias, strategy games, dungeon crawlers, and light gun shooters, among many other genres. Many of these unofficial games have introduced new fans to the series, and it's likely that Touhou would never have exploded in popularity if ZUN had adopted the same hostility towards his fanbase as Nintendo seemingly holds for its own. Fortunately, not everyone in the industry is as stubborn as Nintendo, and studios such as Bethesda and Valve have (mostly) supported mods and fangames such as Skyblivion and Black Mesa.\n\nToday, indie games are thriving like never before thanks to all the amazing releases that have replaced Touhou as the face of indie gaming. Likewise, fan games and heartfelt homages to specific series are still common, despite Nintendo and other companies' recent attempts to change that. But even after all these years, Touhou remains one of gaming's most important series, even if it doesn't always get the recognition it deserves.\n\nThankfully, the Touhou series has become more accessible in recent years. The latest entries are all available on Steam, and most of the older games have received fan translations. Even if you're not a hardcore bullet-hell fan, it's worth trying out Touhou just to experience one of the most underrated series in gaming history.",

      "url": "https://www.howtogeek.com/game-soundtracks-that-changed-my-opinion-of-game-music/",
      "text": "Quick Links\nWhile gameplay is the most important part of any game, music is an essential part of setting the mood or getting you pumped for the action that's to come. Over the years I've played thousands of games, and in a few rare cases the music was so good I had to stop what I was doing, and listen.\nThese are soundtracks that are worth tracking down the CDs for, or loading up a Spotify playlist.\n10 Nier Automata\nIt's no exaggeration to say that Nier Automata is in my top five personal best games of all time, and the soundtrack is a big part of the reason. The atmosphere of the game is quite important to the setting, and the lush post-apocalyptic stages are elevated to another level thanks to the beautiful music, featuring choral vocals often singing in a made-up language.\nSometimes, I'll put the OST on and simply listen to the whole thing with my eyes closed. Yes, children. You can listen to music all on its own. It's not just background noise.\n9 Doom 2016\nThe original DOOM game in 1993 was not only some of the first proper video game music I heard, since we finally had a sound card at that point, it was also one of my earliest exposures to thrash metal, which would become a lifelong love of mine.\nAs good as classic DOOM's music is (and the recent re-release has an awesome live-recorded version of it), DOOM 2016's soundtrack is life-changing both for gamers and fans of music in general. Created mainly by composer Mick Gordon, the music in DOOM 2016 is highly experimental, sonically-dense, and infinitely interesting. Gordon combines traditional heavy metal sounds and fuses them with industrial synths and, I kid you not, the actual modified recordings of a real chainsaw.\n8 Chrono Trigger\nChrono Trigger is at the top of most \"best JRPG\" lists you'll find online, and it absolutely deserves it. This game is one of those rare titles that really has nothing you could improve or change about it. It's not that every aspect of the game is perfect, it's just more than the sum of its parts. So if you fiddle with just one aspect, the whole thing might lose it's shine.\nThe music in Chrono Trigger is an essential part of that recipe. This is mainly the work of legendary composer Yasunori Mitsuda with a little help from even bigger legend Nobuo Uematsu. Mistuda also did the music for Xenogears and Chrono Cross. Both games that themselves have amazing soundtracks. Just have a look at Mitsuda's video game music career and I bet you'll see more than a few classic titles you love.\n7 Halo\nI'm not the world's most avid Halo player, though I've finished the campaigns for all the mainline games except ODST (yeah I don't like it) and Halo Infinite (I'll get to it). However, while I'm ambivalent about the gameplay in these games, the story and score are both top-tier in my book.\nThe Halo main theme has been on my in-car play list for years. The only reason I stopped listening to it during my commute is that I work from home now.\n6 The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\nI should really extend this to the entire Elder Scrolls series, but I think the most refined versions of Jeremy Soule's music is in the fifth game\u2014Skyrim. It's also one of my favorite tunes to doodle when I find time to actually pick up my guitar.\nObviously, the main theme is the star of the show here, but there are just so many beautiful pieces, particularly the ambient ones, which makes this a favorite OST for me to put up while I work.\n5 Street Fighter II\nStreet Fighter II is still the best fighting game in history in my opinion, but then I'm biased because I was lucky enough to grow up with the arcade cabinets of the game in my dad's small arcade. Which also means I got to hear the proper music, rather than the stripped-down chiptunes we got on home consoles.\nGuile's Theme is the most famous track, mainly thanks to meme culture, but it's a certified bop as some people who used to be kids said at some point. It goes way beyond that one track though. Most of the major characters have their own distinctive tracks and this might actually be one of the first times I heard real music in a video game. So it definitely left an impression on me.\n4 The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\nI have a strange relationship with the Zelda games. I know they are excellent games, I know that people love them, and many of them should be the type of games I like. Particularly Breath of the Wild, yet despite spending a ton of money on Zelda games, I always drop them after a few hours as I lose interest.\nNow, the exact same thing is true for me when it comes to The Legend of Zelda:Ocarina of Time, but during the bit of time I played the remaster on my 3DS, I was extremely impressed by the music. This game in particular has a strong emphasis on music as part of the gameplay and story, and the songs are simple, catchy, and really do a good job of establishing the vibe if the game section you're in. It's just good fundamental music composition.\n3 Every Final Fantasy\nMost Final Fantasy music is the work of maestro Nobuo Uematsu and I could write an entire article just about the best tracks (in my opinion) from all the various games. My personal favorites include Liberi Fatali, Vamo' alla Flamenco, One-winged Angel, and so many more.\nThere have also been a ton of covers and reimaginings of the music from these games. My absolute favorite is one of Uematsu's own side projects\u2014The Black Mages. There are several albums from the group, with the best Final Fantasy music reimagined as virtuoso heavy metal and rock music. It's some of the best-produced and arranged music I have ever heard.\n2 Journey\nIs Journey really a game? Well, if you ask me, not really. It's solidly in the \"walking sim\" category of titles where most of the time you're just pushing forward on the stick, and occasionally you have to jump over something. It's very linear, not very long, and it's also an absolutely amazing experience.\nJourney is really more a piece of digital art, with the sights and sounds evoking emotion through simple and effective storytelling. I don't really want to spoil the whole thing, but once you've played through it, you'll want to go back to the soundtrack from time to time because of the memories attached to the songs.\n1 Shadow of the Colossus\nShadow of the Colossus is another game that lives near the top of my all-time favorites list, and I have particularly intense feeling about this one, because the first time I played it, I had only 24 hours to complete the whole game on my PlayStation 2 before the game had to be returned to the person I borrowed it from.\nThe titular colossi are tragic figures with their own unique personalities, and the music of the game reflects that perfectly. It manages to be both beautiful and pulse-pounding. It's not an OST I listen to on its own much, but it definitely left an impression on me at the time. Well, maybe the sleep deprivation also had something to do with it.\nThere are, of course, so many more games I could talk about when it comes to music. Like movies, video games seem to be one of the last bastions where classical music composers can still find work. So, from that perspective alone, it's worth dipping into the world of game music if you're interested in modern classical music. There's a reason so many orchestras have events where they play video game music. Even people with season tickets who don't know the source material can still appreciate it.\nFor those of us who are gamers, these songs can take on an even more special meaning. After all, this is what was playing while you were in the heat of battle, or discovering something marvelous in an open game world. Like music you hear in other parts of your life, it's that connection to a time, a place, and a feeling that really makes a difference, but it also helps that some of the most talented musicians in the world work in this industry to all our benefit."

      "text": "If you loved flash games, then you might remember a few that ended up on the bigger consoles. Interestingly, this happened more often than people know, and many of our favorite games started out in this nostalgic format. In fact, some of the best games are just bigger and better versions of their flash counterparts.\n13 Bloons Tower Defence Had Many Games Before It\nBloons Tower Defense started as a straightforward but very fun Flash game that came out in 2007. The game challenged players to carefully set up towers, mostly monkeys, to stop waves of brightly colored balloons from making it to the end of a set path.\nThis is an easy-to-understand idea, but mixing it with cute visuals and increasing difficulty was an easy way to attract a large player base. The first Flash game\u2019s popularity led to versions being made for mobile devices and later for gaming consoles, with games like Bloons TD 5 being released on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. Keep in mind, you can still use Adobe Flash if you're interested in the old Bloons TD games.\n12 TowerFall: Ascension Is a Sequel to TowerFall\nTowerFall: Ascension started as a project by Maddy Thorson, a regular browser game creator. TowerFall was her first full-priced commercial game. This game began development in 2012 when Alec Holowka and Thorson worked together at a game jam. They then made a game about a highly skilled archer in a legendary setting.\nThey originally wanted to include many different weapons, but in the end, they decided to focus only on the bow and arrow. The game first launched on the Ouya console, but later grew into a complete expanded version. Thorson made a new deal to release TowerFall: Ascension on PlayStation 4 and Steam, adding new weapons and gameplay features.\n11 The Fancy Pants Adventures Wasn\u2019t as Fancy to Start With\nThe Fancy Pants Adventures is a side-scrolling platform game series that started as a free browser game made by Brad Borne. The first game came out in 2006 with smooth controls, a cool stick figure art style, and fun momentum-based gameplay. The series became very popular and led to a console version published by EA.\nThis version had better graphics, all-new levels, and a multiplayer mode for Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network. This console release showed how strong the original Flash games' gameplay was, but the series did not stop there. In 2017, the series expanded again with a Steam release called Super Fancy Pants Adventure.\n10 Hollow Knight Was Once a Very Hungry Knight\nHollow Knight's rise to fame as a beloved indie game did not start on consoles but at a small game jam in 2013. Australian developers Ari Gibson and William Pellen made a simple Flash game called Hungry Knight, which laid the foundation for the vast world of Hallownest. Although Hungry Knight itself did not get much praise, it motivated the two to develop the idea of a rich, interconnected underground kingdom filled with insects.\nThey managed to bring their vision to consoles, where the game found a bigger audience and even more praise, solidifying its place as a modern Metroidvania masterpiece. The fact that the console versions stayed faithful to the original design showed that the initial idea, even as a Flash game, had been strong, even if it was not fully recognized at first.\n9 The Binding of Isaac Started as a Flash Game\nThe Binding of Isaac is a roguelike action-adventure game that originally started as a Flash game. Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl created it during a week-long game jam, where developers make games quickly. The game takes some loose inspiration from the biblical story of the same name, and it quickly became popular because of its unusual mix of gameplay and its dark, sometimes unsettling themes.\nThe roguelike style of the game, with its randomly created dungeons and many different items and power-ups, made players want to replay it and try new strategies. McMillen actually thought the game would not sell well. However, its popularity led to a remake called The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, which came out on consoles and PC with better graphics, more content, and smoother performance.\n8 Alien Hominid Came From a Flash Legend\nAlien Hominid started as a Flash game made in 2002 by Tom Fulp, the creator of Newgrounds, and Dan Paladin. In the game, you play as a yellow alien who crashes on Earth and has to fight off waves of secret agents. The original Flash game was famous for being very difficult because the alien dies in just one hit.\nAlien Hominid did so well that Dan Paladin\u2019s coworker John Byers offered to help them make a console version of the game. In 2004, the game came out on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox, becoming one of the first Flash games to make the jump to consoles.\n7 VVVVVV Started Life With Far Fewer Levels\nVVVVVV began as a Flash game created by Terry Cavanagh. Over time, it grew beyond its origins on platforms like MiniClip and Newgrounds and eventually became a full console release.\nThe art style of VVVVVV is strongly influenced by 8-bit computer games from the 1980s, particularly Jet Set Willy and Monty on the Run. The game includes more than 400 rooms and has excellent level design with no unnecessary or repetitive content. What makes VVVVVV unique is that the player cannot jump; they just modify gravity.\n6 Trials Was Originally a Great Find by Ubisoft\nTrials is a great example of a flash game that managed to transition successfully to consoles. The Trials series started as a Java-based browser game, and it did not use Flash until the second game. The development team brought Trials to consoles for the first time with the Xbox 360 release of Trials HD in 2009, and it's been popular ever since.\nTrials is a well-known obstacle course game that focuses heavily on realistic physics. The game encourages players to try different approaches and figure out the best way to complete each level in a way that feels intuitive. Ubisoft may keep notes on how you play their games, but they sure find good games to put out.\n5 Swords & Souls: Neverseen Is a Lot Like the Original\nSwords and Souls: Neverseen is a special role-playing game that started from modest origins. Before it came out on Steam in 2019, the game that came before it, Swords and Souls, was a well-liked flash game made by SoulGame Studio. The original Swords and Souls challenged players to become the strongest fighter in SoulTown by training their skills through mini-games and fighting enemies in an arena.\nSwords and Souls: Neverseen expanded on the gameplay of the first game by introducing a much larger standalone adventure set on an island called the Neverseen. Players improve their character by playing mini-games, quick battles, taming pets, and finding unusual mercenaries.\n4 Celeste Was Once a Lot Simpler\nCeleste is a platform video game created as a PICO-8 game by Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry in 2015. Thorson and Berry later expanded the PICO-8 version into a full-length game. The player controls a character named Madeline, who can run, jump, climb walls for a short time, jump off walls, and dash while in the air.\nCeleste is beloved not only for its gameplay but also for the story, visuals, and soundtrack. The game's mechanics reflected Madeline's personal challenges, turning the climb to the top of the mountain into a symbol for facing and overcoming personal struggles."

      "text": "If you're ever in the mood for something that's easy to pick up and play, look no further than browser games. While there's a seemingly endless supply of relaxing time-wasters and addictive score-chasers made specifically for browsers, you can also find browser ports of retro gaming classics from all genres.\nWhether you're in the mood for nostalgic gaming hits or underrated cult classics, these browser ports are only a few clicks away.\n11 WipEout\nWipEout is a fast-paced, futuristic racing game that places you in the driver's seat of a high-speed hovercraft, blending elements of Mario Kart and F-Zero to form one of the best racing games on the PS1. Each of WipEout's seven unique tracks challenge you to tackle winding turns and precarious jumps while also battling opponents at breakneck speeds with a variety of weapon pickups. Although you won't find much of a story in WipEout, the game makes up for the lack of narrative substance with its sleek visuals, electrifying techno soundtrack, and what is easily one of the fastest racing experiences in gaming.\nAlthough the WipEout series was unfairly abandoned by Sony, the first game is now easier to access than ever before, thanks to a browser port created by Dominic Szablewski. This port was created with a recompiled version of the original game's source code (which had been leaked back in 2022) and updates the original PS1 experience with a steady 60 FPS and an increased resolution. Everything from the original WipEout is here and\u2014apart from a few minor bugs\u2014it's even better than any of the game's official ports.\n10 Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2\nThe Command and Conquer series is one of the pillars of the real-time strategy (RTS) genre, having helped establish the modern RTS formula alongside Warcraft. Like most other RTS series, the Command and Conquer games revolve around a cycle of resource-gathering, base-building, and strategic battles as you gradually amass an unstoppable army to crush the opposing faction. The series also set itself apart with its storytelling, using full-motion video cutscenes to deliver thrilling plots about globe-spanning military conflicts unfolding across various alternate histories. These cutscenes range from chillingly bleak to hilariously hammy, but the Command and Conquer games never fail to engage you in their war-torn worlds.\nEvery Command and Conquer game has its own dedicated fanbase, but Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2 is often considered to be the fan-favorite of the franchise. There are a few different fan projects designed to make the game playable on modern systems, including the fan-made browser version: Red Alert 2: Chrono Divide. While single-player fans may be disappointed to hear that Chrono Divide lacks the original game's story campaigns, the port does offer cross-platform multiplayer, mod support, and every multiplayer map from the original Red Alert 2. At the time of writing, Chrono Divide is in active development, meaning the missing features will likely be restored in future updates. But even with these omissions, Chrono Divide is still an excellent way to return to Red Alert 2.\n9 SimCity\nThe original SimCity paved the way for numerous sequels, spinoffs, and spiritual successors to build upon its addictive city-planning simulation. SimCity may seem bare-bones compared to most modern city-builder games, but its simpler visuals and straightforward challenge are still captivating enough to keep you hooked. Building your city, balancing its needs, and keeping up with natural disasters and other unpredictable challenges is still just as fun as it was back in 1989. While you probably won't find yourself sinking hundreds of hours into SimCity, especially if you've played any of its vastly improved successors, it has surprisingly stood the test of time.\nBack in 2008, programmer Don Hopkins released the source code for the original SimCity under the name \"Micropolis.\" Despite the different name\u2014which was taken from the game's early development build\u2014Micropolis is still the original SimCity at its core. Since then, there have been multiple open-source browser ports of Micropolis, with micropolisJS still being the best of the bunch. This version runs in javascript and contains nearly all the core features of SimCity, apart from its scenario mode.\n8 Fate/Stay Night\nAnyone with a passing interest in anime or visual novels has probably heard of Fate/Stay Night and its countless spinoffs. Originally released back in 2004, Fate/Stay Night centers around the \"Holy Grail War,\" a battle royale tournament wherein powerful mages summon famous historical warriors to fight to the death. Each of the game's three major story routes chronicles the war from the perspective of Shirou Emiya, an inexperienced teenage mage who unwittingly becomes a participant in the fifth Holy Grail War, which leads him into a series of harrowing encounters and life-or-death decisions.\nFate/Stay Night is known for being an absurdly long game, clocking in at almost 100 hours if you pursue all endings, but don't let the lengthy runtime scare you away. After its slow opening, Fate/Stay Night delivers a fantastic story brimming with compelling characters, shocking plot twists, and plenty of fantasy action. There are a few different methods of playing Fate/Stay Night, including the free browser port developed by Kent Hagerman.\nThis version of the game includes all three major story routes and a flowchart that allows you to jump to any point in the story. Although it's not the best version of Fate/Stay Night\u2014lacking save-states and requiring you to scroll through the text instead of progressing through separate screens\u2014the browser port is still a great way to begin the Fate series.\nFate/Stay Night: Remastered\n- Released\n- August 7, 2024\n7 Tsukihime\nA few years before creating Fate/Stay Night, developer Type Moon made its debut with Tsukihime. This cult-classic visual novel follows Shiki Tohno, a seemingly ordinary high-schooler with an extraordinary power that enables him to see \u201clines of death\u201d on living beings, allowing him to end their lives by severing these lines. Despite his attempts to live a normal life, a series of bizarre events and violent impulses lead Shiki to an ancient vampire named Arcueid.\nAfter a blood-splattered introduction, the two form an uneasy alliance to track down a mysterious serial killer who's turned their quiet neighborhood into his personal hunting ground. What begins as a straightforward supernatural mystery (with hints of romance) gradually unravels into a gruesome psychological thriller as Shiki learns more about Arcueid, a mysterious new classmate named Ciel, and his own secretive family history. While it takes some time for Tsukihime to reveal its true colors, the story's shocking twists and gripping drama are well worth the wait.\nSurprisingly, the browser port of Tsukihime is one of the best ways to experience the game. This port features a variety of quality-of-life features absent from most official releases, including a detailed story flowchart, an image gallery, and optional content warnings for certain scenes. However, it\u2019s also worth noting that the browser port is based on the original, uncensored release of Tsukihime, which features graphic adult content in both its visuals and text. Multiple scenes throughout the game explore sensitive topics and contain graphic depictions of horrific acts, so play this version at your own discretion.\n6 Pac-Man\nWhether you grew up playing in arcades, on consoles, or don't have much experience with gaming in general, you probably don't need any introduction to Pac-Man. Even after 45 years, Pac-Man remains one of the most iconic games of all time. Whereas most other arcade games have faded into obscurity over the decades, Pac-Man has continually proven itself to be a timeless classic. Of course, that also means it's been preserved on most platforms, including browsers.\nBack in 2010, Google celebrated the 30th anniversary of Pac-Man by replacing the logo on its homepage with Doodle Pac-Man, a fully playable browser version of the 1980 arcade classic with a Google-themed stage. Apart from the remixed level layout, this version plays exactly like the original game, even featuring the familiar \"kill-screen\" if you somehow manage to reach level 256. While Doodle Pac-Man only appeared on the Google home screen for one day, you can still play it here.\nPac-Man\n- Released\n- July, 1980\n- ESRB\n- e\n- Developer(s)\n- Namco\n- Publisher(s)\n- Namco, Midway Games\n- Engine\n- Unreal Engine\n- Franchise\n- Pac-Man\n5 Diablo\nThe original Diablo was a revolutionary RPG for its time, trading the genre's usual focus on party-management and long-winded storytelling for an addictive emphasis on real-time action and solo dungeon-crawling. Your journey through Diablo will have you exploring 16 randomized floors of a massive dungeon leading into hell, battling monsters and gradually strengthening your character with better armor, stronger attacks, and experience points to level up.\nAlthough Diablo follows the standard ARPG formula, the game still delivers a uniquely atmospheric experience that not even its own sequels have replicated. The original Diablo is a slow, brutally punishing test of skill and persistence, with each successive level proving tougher than the last. Your foes are more fearsome than fodder, the music more tense than triumphant, and the world more grim than grandiose. Diablo's hopeless descent into hell is a stark contrast to the loot-filled power-fantasies of later entries, making it a game worth revisiting for even the most experienced ARPG players.\nIf you already own a copy of Diablo\u2014whether it's on-disc or the digital GoG re-release\u2014you can run the game from your browser by uploading the DIABDAT.MPQ file to its fan-made browser port. Even if you don't own the game, the website already includes the shareware version, which limits you to the warrior class and only includes the first two levels. However, this makes it easy to try out the game or play on mobile devices.\n4 Serial Experiments Lain\nBased on the anime of the same name, Serial Experiments Lain is a 1998 Japan-exclusive PS1 game with an unusual approach to storytelling. If you haven't seen the original series\u2014which you really should\u2014all you need to know about the show is that it tells the story of Lain Iwakura, a teenage girl who finds herself becoming increasingly obsessed with a global network known as \"the Wired\"\u2014which essentially acts as an analogue for the early internet.\nWhat follows is a surreal, scarily prophetic story about the internet's rapid encroachment on our daily lives, its growing influence on social interaction, and its unsettling ability to reshape a person's self-identity. The game explores these same concepts in a different context, having you scroll through a web-like interface to view audio logs, diary entries, and animated cutscenes. As you find more information, you'll unlock new data logs needed to piece together the full story, though some parts of this narrative puzzle will ultimately be left up to your interpretation.\nWhile you don't need to watch Serial Experiments Lain to understand the game, there's not much here for anyone who isn't already a die-hard fan of the anime. The entire game consists of listening to audio logs and viewing brief cutscenes, with no traditional gameplay to speak of between the hours of nonstop exposition. If you don't already have an attachment to this series and its characters, you might not have the patience to sit through its cryptic story. But for longtime fans of Serial Experiments Lain who have been waiting to play the game, an English version is finally available thanks to lainTSX, a browser-based recreation and translation of the original PS1 version. Just be aware that the game can be very confusing, so you may want to have a guide on hand before you start playing.\n3 Commander Keen\nBefore iD Software popularized first-person shooters with Wolfenstein 3D and later perfected the genre with Doom, the studio made its debut with the family-friendly Commander Keen in \"Invasion of the Vortigons\". This 2D platformer sees you take on the role of the eponymous Commander Keen, an eight-year-old who travels across different planets in a quest to rebuild his spaceship and stop an alien attack on Earth.\nEach level has you running, jumping, and shooting your way through foes, while also\u2014and stop me if you've heard this one before, iD fans\u2014hunting down colored keycards and uncovering hidden entrances to secret levels. Although it lacks the super shotguns and visible viscera of its FPS successors, Commander Keen still deserves some credit for laying out the blueprint that defined iD's massively influential shooters and the countless games they inspired.\nLike many PC games of its time, Commander Keen in \"Invasion of the Vortigons\" originally received an episodic release, but you can play the game from your browser through its reverse-engineered web port: Chocolate Keen. This version plays exactly like the original MS-DOS release and is easily the best way of experiencing the original trilogy.\n2 Doom\nSpeaking of iD Software, we obviously have to mention Doom. The 1994 shooter about blasting through otherworldly invaders on Mars\u2014which could also be an apt description for Commander Keen\u2014is playable on nearly any device. Calculators, cash registers, cameras, bacteria cells; you name it, someone has probably run Doom on it. So it should come as no surprise that Doom is also playable on web browsers.\nWAD Commander is a browser tool that allows you to run WAD files for Doom and Doom II. Along with being able to play the vanilla games and their expansions, WAD Commander is also compatible with PWAD files for the majority of custom maps. However, WADS for separate games built on the Doom engine\u2014such as Hexen and Heretic\u2014aren't fully supported, yet.\nYour comment has not been saved\nDoom (1993)\n- OpenCritic Reviews\n- Top Critic Avg: 86/100 Critics Rec: 92%\n- Released\n- December 10, 1993\n- ESRB\n- M for Mature: Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Strong Language\n- Developer(s)\n- id Software\n- Publisher(s)\n- id Software\nYour comment has not been saved"

      "text": "Steam has a very loyal player base, and it's not by accident. There are plenty of other launchers and game stores, but Steam has held onto its success like no other.\nDespite challenges from Epic, Amazon, and soon Google (plus the DRM-free marketplace that is GOG), Steam is still number one. There are many reasons for this, and Steam has shown no signs of stopping any time soon.\n10 Steam Is Not Publicly Traded\nSteam\u2019s setup as a privately owned company makes it more attractive to players. Since Steam is private, it doesn\u2019t face the same pressure to constantly grow or make quick profits that public companies often do. Public companies have to answer to shareholders who expect strong earnings every few months, but Steam has more freedom to focus on long-term plans and spend money on projects that help its users, even if those projects don\u2019t make money right away.\nThis independence lets Steam make choices that players appreciate, like keeping its fair refund policy and supporting gaming on Linux. Public companies might avoid these moves because they seem too risky or not profitable enough, but Steam\u2019s decisions build trust and strengthen its image as a platform that genuinely listens to its players.\n9 Steam Feels Like a Hub for Games, Not Just a Store\nSteam does more than just sell digital games; it helps build a community around gaming. It gives players ways to talk, discuss, rate, and interact with each other. Steam acts as a main place for conversations and lets players meet others who enjoy the same games. Steam has a lot of useful features, like community forums, gaming groups, user reviews, and even areas for fan art and game guides.\nThese tools turn Steam into a social space where users can meet up, share their experiences, and find content made by other players. This makes gaming more enjoyable and helps players feel like they\u2019re part of a group. The company understands that these extra features help keep players interested and bring in new users. It also makes players feel more attached to their accounts and the games they own on Steam.\n8 Valve Refused to Sell Steam to Companies Like Microsoft\nAs revealed through an email from Microsoft, Valve has many prospective buyers, but the company isn't interested. This keeps the platform free from outside control and lets it stay dedicated to PC gaming. This freedom is important because it means Steam can push back against Microsoft\u2019s influence over PC gaming. By developing SteamOS on Linux, Steam has created a backup option, a kind of safety net, in case Microsoft ever makes Windows too limiting for gamers. This has had a positive knock-on effect on many gamers, including those who choose not to use Windows and handheld gamers who bought a Steam Deck.\nValve appears to care about the gaming community, rather than just making as much money as possible. This approach makes gamers feel like they\u2019re working with Steam, not just being treated as customers. Because Steam sticks to this way of doing things instead of selling out to a huge corporation, gamers stay loyal to the platform and can keep enjoying everything it offers without worrying about corporate interference.\n7 Steam Is One of Valve\u2019s Primary Sources of Income\nValve depends on Steam as its main income source, pushing the company to keep improving the platform. This makes Valve different from competitors who treat their game launchers as just add-ons to their other businesses. For example, Epic Games makes a lot of money from Fortnite, Ubisoft earns from selling its own games, and Microsoft has an operating system business, console ecosystem, and hardware divisions.\nThese companies have other ways to make money; they might not feel as much pressure to keep upgrading their launchers since their success doesn\u2019t completely depend on them. However, it's different for Valve, as Steam is a big part of the company's income. Valve has to keep making the platform better to hold onto its users and attract new ones. It is a strong reason to keep adding new features and improving the experience.\n6 Steam Has Been Around for Over 20 Years\nSteam has been a major part of PC gaming for a long time, which is a big reason why so many people like it and stay loyal to it. Since it\u2019s been around for more than 20 years, a lot of gamers see Steam as the go-to place for PC gaming. Being around for so long has helped Steam develop into a powerful platform with lots of useful features.\nSteam has built a strong community, making people feel comfortable and trusting it in a way that newer platforms can\u2019t easily match. Some players have spent decades collecting games on Steam. Putting so much time and money into their Steam libraries is a strong reason to stick with Steam. Players have also earned achievements, collected trading cards, made friends in the community, and customized their profiles on Steam.\n5 Steam's Legendary Sales Help Gamers Build a Library\nSteam regularly offers sales and discounts that make buying games more appealing. These sales let players buy games at much lower prices, which makes gaming more affordable and opens it up to more people. The sales often happen and come in many forms, like big seasonal events, promotions from specific game publishers, and random discounts. There\u2019s usually something new to check out.\nThis keeps the platform interesting and makes players want to come back often to see what\u2019s on sale. Because of these constant sales, players often collect and try out new games they wouldn\u2019t normally buy at full price. It's not uncommon to have a game library that's overflowing, and sales are a big reason for that.\n4 Users Get Points for Spending More\nSteam has a rewards program that gives users points when they spend money on the platform. These points make spending feel more worthwhile since users get something extra beyond just buying games. The system is designed to encourage people to keep using Steam by rewarding them for their purchases.\nUsers can spend their Steam Points in the Points Shop to buy things like profile backgrounds, avatars, badges, and emoticons. These items let players customize their Steam profiles to show off their value and accomplishments. Many of these cosmetics are only available in the Points Shop, which makes them special and something dedicated Steam users want to collect.\n3 Steam Workshop Makes Modding Easy (and Free)\nAnother reason players love Steam is because it has a history of supporting free mods and the people who make them. This is something that other platforms often don\u2019t do well or only do sometimes. There are plenty of games that are better with mods, and Steam knows that. The Steam Workshop acts as a main place where players can easily search for, download, and add fan-made content to their games.\nThis easy access helps games stay fun and interesting for longer by giving players new ways to play beyond what the original creators designed. The Workshop also helps modders by giving them the tools and a space to share their work. Steam\u2019s focus on modding is important because it makes the platform different from others who might care more about making money than supporting content made by players.\n2 Valve Looks Out for Steam Users\nSteam\u2019s focus on keeping users safe is a big reason why many PC gamers like using it. The platform works hard to maintain its reputation as a secure and dependable place to buy games. One clear way it does this is by keeping an eye out for games that might have issues. If a game hasn\u2019t been updated in a long time, Steam will put a notice on its store page to warn buyers.\nThis way, people know before they buy that the game might no longer be supported by its developers, helping them avoid games that could be abandoned. Another way Steam protects users is by stepping in when scams or harmful content show up on the platform. A good example of this is what happened with The Day Before. When it became clear that the game might be a scam, Steam quickly removed it from the store and gave refunds to players who had bought it.\n1 Steam is Constantly Improving\nSteam has stayed popular for so long because it keeps changing and improving. While some platforms stay the same and don\u2019t get better, Steam is always working to improve the user experience by adding new features and fixing problems. For example, adding in Updated Compression in February.\nOver the past twenty years, Steam has made big changes to how it looks and works, but it does these changes slowly, so users don\u2019t feel overwhelmed. Features like those mentioned above keep the platform feeling fresh. If Steam can keep this up, players won't ever leave the service.\nSteam is king of the PC games marketplace, but there are other choices. In particular, you might be interested in the Epic Games Store's free monthly games (which are also now coming to Android).\n-\nValve Steam Deck\n- Dimensions\n- 298mm x 117mm x 49mm\n- Playing Time\n- 2-8 hours of gameplay (content-dependent)\nThe Steam Deck LCD is, hands down, the best budget handheld gaming PC you can get, thanks to its phenomenal price, top-notch build quality, excellent software support, and pretty solid gaming performance.\n-\nSteam Deck OLED\n- Dimensions\n- 298mm x 117mm x 49mm\n- Weight\n- 640 grams\nThe Steam Deck OLED is a clear improvement over Valve's original handheld console, with a larger battery, more storage, faster Wi-Fi, and more. Not to forget the bigger and better-looking OLED screen that gives the device its name."

      "url": "https://www.howtogeek.com/some-gamers-are-obsessed-with-indie-games-heres-why/",
      "text": "Summary\n- Indie games are developed by independent studios without the huge publisher resources that big budget releases get.\n- Despite smaller budgets and teams, indie games can provide an engaging story, unique aesthetics, and strong community connections.\n- With tens of thousands of indie games available, there's a near-endless variety to explore and support, often at affordable prices.\nIf you've ever scrolled through the Steam library, you must have stumbled upon a few interesting games with an \"Indie\" label. You check the reviews and see that some players with hundreds of recorded hours completely obsess over this game you've never heard of. So, is the hype justified?\nWhat Is an Indie Game?\nYou've likely heard the term \"indie\" before in the context of movies and music, but what does it actually mean? \"Indie\" is short for \"independent\" and applies to any game made by an independent studio or developer without the resources provided by a big publisher.\nIndie games are the opposite of triple-A (AAA) games that are made by teams of hundreds of people and cost tens of millions of dollars to develop. Though indie games are available on all platforms, most start life on the PC as it's easier and cheaper to develop and release games, in no small part thanks to Steam.\nIt's worth noting that some games \"disguise\" themselves as indie games but are actually backed by major publishers. The Dave the Diver controversy at the Game Awards 2023 is a good example of a game that looks like an indie but is backed by a multi-billion company.\nThe lack of a large budget and infrastructure matters because the average game can take hundreds or thousands of work hours to create. An average video game developer can earn over $100,000 a year, so just hiring ten developers for a couple of years to develop a smaller game can cost well over $2 million. That's without accounting for audio, level, and character designs, artwork, and the numerous other professionals necessary to make a good game.\nSome large indie studios have already seen financial success and can provide proper compensation and hire whomever they need, such as Hades developer Supergiant Games. But this often isn't the case, as a good proportion of indie games are passion projects of one or just a few individuals who don't expect a lot in return.\nSometimes, this hard work pays off in dividends. Stardew Valley is one of the best indie games of all time, and it was created by a single person named Eric Barone. To give you some perspective, Eric had to work 70-hour weeks for four and a half years to create this awesome game, which eventually earned him millions of dollars.\nIndie Games Must Have a Special Sauce\nIf an indie developer wants their game to succeed, they have to make it fun and original. Unlike triple-A developers who have a lot of expectations to live up to, indie developers are more prone to taking risks. In a way, they have to take risks if they want their game to stand out among thousands of other games.\nThey need to convince you that their game is worth your precious free time. An indie game has to keep you entertained and provide something that you can't find in more popular titles. Let's not forget that indie games lack the marketing budgets seen by their triple-A counterparts, so they depend on word of mouth and the gaming press.\nGamers who like indie games may overlook some pretty egregious bugs when a game is still in early access, as long as the game is fun. A great example is PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), which started life as an indie game and kick-started the battle royale genre. I played the game when it was still in early access, and while it was quite buggy, the game's unique formula more than made up for it with engaging gameplay.\nThe gimmick doesn't have to be genre-defining gameplay, though. It could also be an original story, art style (like pixel art and the use of cel-shading), or an innovative mechanic. It could also just be a well-made labor of love that does everything well enough.\nCutting-edge graphics aren't usually the focal point of these games, though some games like Bodycam leverage high-resolution photo-realism as their unique selling point. Other games just go for a unique aesthetic, as was the case with Hollow Knight and Cuphead.\nNear-Endless Variety\nOnce you dive into the world of indie games, you'll quickly realize how many good examples there are out there waiting to be played. Want 2D Minecraft? You got Terraria (or Factorio if you want 2D Minecraft with industrial mods). Looking for a heavy metal rhythm FPS Doom clone? Try Metal: Hellsinger and BPM: Bullets Per Minute. There are games that appeal to every niche you can imagine.\nWhile we only see about 180 \"double-A\" and triple-A releases each year, we get nearly 13,800 indie games on Steam. Even if 13,000 of them are absolutely terrible or something you'd never play, you're still left with more than two new games per day. So, while you're waiting for the next major release from EA or Ubisoft, check out the indie aisle. I'm sure that you'll find something that you like.\nSmaller Scope, Bigger Impact\nSince indie teams are smaller both in terms of size and budget, it inevitably affects the finished product. I've already mentioned sacrifices in the visual department, but another common sacrifice is game length. Many of them provide a shorter story that takes around 3\u201315 hours to beat. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as many gamers are slowly starting to dislike games that overstay their welcome. I know I do.\nA focused story can be short but still resonate with the audience while also leaving space for a potential sequel if the game succeeds. Other indie games, such as Steamworld: Dig 2, Unpacking, Darkest Dungeon, and my personal favorite, Hades, rely on procedural generation to provide a satisfying, near-infinite gameplay loop.\nMuch of the time, these shorter and more sedate experiences make for more chill games that are perfect for relaxing.\nIndie Developers Work With Their Communities\nTriple-A games are incredibly complex, so any changes that players request take a long time to implement. For instance, it took CD Projekt Red three years to add vehicle combat and fix the police in Cyberpunk 2077. Plus, developers have to aggregate data to figure out which features are in the highest demand and worth spending resources on.\nIn contrast, indie games are often much simpler, so even major gameplay changes don't take as long to implement. Plus, it's easier for indie teams to keep track of player feedback, as they have significantly smaller and more dedicated player bases. You can express what features, fixes, and changes you'd like to see, and there's a good chance that your feedback will be heard and considered.\nIf you want an example, look no further than Yacht Club Games, the developer of Shovel Knight. Perhaps nobody listens to players more than indie developers whose games are being crowdfunded or are still in early access and need money to keep the game in development.\nAlso, being part of a small, tightly-knit community means you can enjoy the game with like-minded individuals, make new friends, and enjoy a deep connection with the game. Discord servers and subreddits are good places to talk to the community and developers.\nDon\u2019t Ignore Indie Games\nThere are so many original indie games; you're bound to find at least a dozen that you'll enjoy as much, or even more than a triple-A release. I was more excited about Hades II than any other game that was released this year. It's still in early access, but I've sunk over twenty hours into it. In contrast, I've barely touched Horizon: Forbidden West, which is big budget a sequel to a game I really enjoyed. This speaks volumes about how much a simple indie game can offer.\nThe best part is that indie games are dirt cheap; they're significantly cheaper than AAA and AA games. Many of them are reasonably priced, but they're even cheaper if in early access or on sale. Some will cost you a couple of bucks. Take the chance to support indie developers so that they can continue giving us new creative games."

      "text": "An \"indie\" game is simply a game where the people creating the game don't answer to any outsiders when it comes to its creative direction. Generally, people think of indie games as having low budgets and small teams, but that's not actually a requirement to be independent.\nAt the same time, there are low-budget games with small teams that are not indie, such as Dave the Diver. There are some games that, to look at, might not trigger the idea of what an indie game should be in your mind. Here are some examples that I think are indie games (though surely you can argue against it) despite it not feeling entirely right to call them that.\nFor this article, just to clear things up, I'm using the Wikipedia definition of indie:\n\"An indie video game or indie game (short for independent video game) is a video game created by individuals or smaller development teams without the financial and technical support of a large game publisher...\"\n10 Minecraft\nThis is perhaps the most successful indie game of all time, but I don't think anyone could argue that Minecraft isn't an indie game. Sure, it stopped being indie when Notch Persson sold it to Microsoft, but the base game upon which this massive media empire was built is largely the work of one man, who had a little help from a talented composer, and a lot of community beta testers.\nThis is basically the ultimate example of a bedroom coder making it big. All respect to Concerned Ape and Localthunk for Stardew Valley and Balatro, but in terms of success, Minecraft stands at the top of the indie mountain as far as I'm concerned.\n9 Jazz Jackrabbit\nToday, Epic Megagames has finally lived up to the audacity of its name, and is a major video game publisher and platform holder. Not to mention the owner of the most popular video game engine, for better or for worse.\nHowever, when it made one of my favorite games ever\u2013Jazz Jackrabbit\u2013 Epic Megagames was just a handful of people, including Cliff Bleszinski. This was the game that kicked off his career, leading to his role in games like Unreal and Gears of War. Technically, the game is a marvel, with programmer Arjan Brussee managing to give us the sidescrolling speed of a Sonic game on the PC, which traditionally didn't do so well with this type of game. Brussee, by the way, is the co-founder of Guerrilla Games. The studio behind Killzone and Horizon: Zero Dawn. It's amazing how humble beginnings can lead to so much!\nYou can buy Jazz Jackrabbit on GOG, where it's part of the GOG Preservation Program.\n8 DOOM\nDOOM is arguably the biggest game of all time, but it was made by a core group of just five people: John Carmack, John Romero, Adrian Carmack, Kevin Cloud, and Tom Hall. The credits for the game list just 15 people total!\nAt this point, ID Software had worked with Apogee as a publisher for games like Commander Keen and Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM was developed and published by ID Software, and used the shareware model to distribute the game, selling copies directly by mail order to people who contacted them. You could, of course, argue that this is only indie by modern standards, and that this was a pretty typical development team size for the time, but having a look around other popular games from the 90s, having such a small core team is still notable, so I'm going to count DOOM as an indie.\n7 Clair Obscur: Expedition 33\nThis is the newest game on the list and really the whole reason I wanted to write it in the first place. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is made by independent French studio Sandfall, with a core team of around 30 people (and dozens of contractors who helped on and off).\nIt doesn't feel like an indie because its budget level is more on the AA game level, and it uses modern Unreal Engine graphics along with full voice and motion capture of professional actors. However, all this really shows is that game development technology now allows indie developers to achieve much more with far less. It means you probably have to recalibrate what \"indie\" means to you, because this is it.\n6 Marathon\nToday, Bungie is known for Halo and Destiny, and is owned by Sony. So its indie days are long behind it, but back in 1994, just 17 people developed and published Marathon for the Mac.\nNot only that, but they made the engine for it from scratch, and if it wasn't for DOOM coming out the year before, we might have called first-person shooters \"Marathon clones\" for the rest of the boomer-shooter era instead.\n5 No Man's Sky\nThis is one of the first indie games where people thinking it was an AA or even AAA game backfired hard. Sean Murray and a very small handful of people (19 roles in the credits) created this space survival and exploration game using the magic of procedural generation. In other words, most of the content isn't hand-crafted, and is instead generated on the fly using clever programming.\nThe hype for the game was just blown out of proportion, and when it released, players were disappointed that the game they got was not the epic space adventure that was (supposedly) promised. Yet, over the last decade, Hello Games has just kept plugging away at the game, updating it and expanding it. Now it's a highly-regarded title and a far cry from that first overly-ambitious indie.\n4 Cuphead\nThis is perhaps one of the most famous indie games that, although it got a leg up from Microsoft in the marketing department, was independently developed and published by Studio MDHR. Starting off with a core team of just three people, culminating in around 25 people working on the game.\nThe main reason this game isn't always clocked as an indie is the insane level of polish and detail involved. Cuphead uses a 1930s bendy animation aesthetic, and it's all hand-animated and captured at incredible quality. It's a true labor of love, and it's one of the hardest games ever made to boot. The studio is still independent, yes even though there's a Cuphead Netflix show, no one has snapped them up yet. Imagine that.\n3 The Witcher (2007)\nOK, I know there's going to be some push-back to my arguments for the first Witcher being an indie game, but hear me out. It might stretch the definition a bit, but I think we can make it work!\nThis is the first game developed by CD Projekt RED, which is a game studio formed by game distributor CD Projekt. However, this is basically just a legal distinction. CD Projekt was at the time a scrappy little company that built up its business doing translation and localization work of games for sale in Poland, where most people simply pirated English games. It gained enough experience working on other developer's games that the company wanted to make its own original game. It owned the rights to the Witcher books for game development purposes and, despite having no idea how to make games, a team of just 15 people started development of The Witcher using the licensed Aurora Engine used for Neverwinter Nights 2, but heavily modified.\nThe budget went a little higher than expected, and by the end of development the team size had grown to around 100, but given the scope and size of this game (which I have about 200 hours in), I still feel that in spirit this was an indie, if not by the strictest letter of the definition. Also, it was published by Atari, but plenty of indie games sign publishing deals without affecting their indie status, so there.\n2 Rocket League\nHas it really been a decade since the smash-hit car soccer game Rocket League launched? It's still an ultra-popular esports staple today and my little brother is pretty addicted to it (and also very good).\nWhile developer Psyonix is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Epic Games as of 2019, when it made Rocket League it was a true-blue indie studio, and nothing will ever change that.\n1 Half-Life 2\nHalf-Life 2? An indie? That Half-Life 2? Yes, this is another one you can fight me on, but I think it qualifies. Why not Valve's first game Half-Life? Well that was partly funded by Sierra Games, so I don't think it counts, but just like ID Software, Valve made enough money from its first game and other titles prior to Half-Life 2 that it didn't need any help funding or publishing the game.\nAdded to this, Valve is famous for its novel flat hierarchy and how development teams and roles are dynamically formed as needed internally. Even the team size for the game was on the smaller side for 2004, with around 80 people. Valve isn't even publicly listed, despite being a massive company today with pretty much full dominance of game distribution on PC. So Lord Gaben answers to no one. No shareholders, no board, no hope of getting Half Life 3 until he says so.\nHonestly, the whole debate about \"what is an indie\" gets old fast. The truth is that the word has always been a little meaningless and fluid, so maybe it makes more sense to concentrate on whether a game is good, and if the people who made it were properly rewarded rather than the boring details of a company's structure."

      "text": "Summary\n- Fan-made remakes can greatly improve upon and add unique elements to beloved games.\n- Small volunteer teams struggle due to limited resources and other commitments, a problem that's highlighted by official efforts.\n- Fan-made projects risk legal issues, like potential DMCA takedowns, despite passionate efforts.\nComparisons between the fan-made Skyblivion remake and Bethesda's official Oblivion Remastered offer an interesting perspective on fan-made projects. We've never before had a professional studio version released around the same time as a fan-made product. Being able to see them side-by-side lays the differences bare while showing how easily a big studio can take the thunder from a fan-made project.\nMany Great Fan Remakes Exist\nThe world of fan-made remakes has a surprisingly large number of successful projects, Skyblivion is just one of them. These projects often go beyond simple copies of the original games, adding creative ideas and major improvements that make them stand out.\nFor example, MiniDoom 2 took the classic first-person shooter Doom and turned it into a fast-paced side-scrolling platformer. It kept the intense action of the original while adding new levels, bosses, and weapons. The game was free to play and was well-received by fans, proving that a new take on a beloved game can make it feel fresh again.\nSimilarly, Pok\u00e9mon Uranium was a completely original Pok\u00e9mon game made using the RPG Maker engine. It built on the series' usual gameplay while introducing a new region, new creatures, and a new story. Its creative ideas felt like a huge improvement on the series, showing that a fan-made game can stay true to the spirit of a franchise while still feeling unique.\nThere\u2019s also Black Mesa, a full remake of Half-Life built in the Source engine. It recreated the original game with great attention to detail, improving the graphics, refining the gameplay (especially the AI and the often-disliked Xen levels), and adding new story elements.\nAt first, the game was released for free, but it was so well-made that Valve later allowed it to be sold commercially. Its success shows just how much fans appreciated the high quality of the remake.\nHowever, the success of fan remakes often comes with a lot of uncertainty. While you can make your own mods, it's hard to match the same level of quality as an official remake.\nSmaller Teams Suffer From Many Limitations\nThe development of ambitious fan-made game remakes like Skyblivion shows a big gap between large studios' resources and what smaller, volunteer-based teams can access. This is something Oblivion Remastered doesn't have to worry about.\nThese limitations affect every part of the development process. This issue persists from the first ideas to the final release, often leading to longer development times, reduced project scope, and sometimes a drop in overall quality.\nThe biggest challenge right away is funding. Big studios have large budgets, but volunteer teams depend entirely on the goodwill, time, and dedication of project members. They can\u2019t always get the tools and assets they need without proper funding, such as professional software, high-quality 3D models, or original music.\nSmall team sizes make these problems worse. Big studios have separate teams for different parts of game development, like programming, art, design, and sound. On the other hand, fan remake teams usually have just a few people who have to handle multiple jobs at once.\nAnother major issue is that volunteer work is usually part-time. Many developers have full-time jobs or other responsibilities outside of the remake project. This makes development schedules unpredictable and can drag out the production process.\nMarketing is also a big challenge for volunteer teams. Unlike commercial games, fan projects don\u2019t have the money or expertise to get widespread attention. Getting media coverage and reaching a large audience is much harder when competing against heavily advertised commercial games. If not enough people hear about the game, it can lead to fewer players and a weaker reception overall.\nAll of these factors mean that fan-based remakes, no matter how passionate and dedicated they are, often can\u2019t match the quality, scope, or timely release of games made by professional studios. The result is still an impressive achievement, but one that normally doesn't add up to a professional team.\nThe Legality Is Rarely Gray Enough to Avoid a DMCA\nFan-made game remakes, while often praised for their ambition and hard work, exist in a risky legal situation. These projects, created out of passion and built through years of unpaid effort, often come dangerously close to violating intellectual property (IP) laws. Bethesda could have a great case against Skyblivion, if they chose to pursue legal action.\nThe biggest legal danger comes from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which allows copyright owners to demand the removal of works that use their IP without permission. Fan remakes, by definition, use parts of the original game such as code, artwork, music, and even gameplay systems that the original publisher legally owns.\nEven if a project says it is not making money, using copyrighted material without direct permission still counts as breaking the law, putting creators at serious legal risk. Unlike making an original game, fan projects have almost no legal protection. Copyright law strongly favors the original owners, meaning game publishers have the power to shut down fan remakes at any stage of development.\nHow they use this power varies, with some publishers being more accepting of fan projects than others. Years of effort spent carefully recreating a favorite game can be wiped out in an instant by a single DMCA takedown notice.\nThe impact goes beyond just the creators. The excited communities that support these projects are also hurt when the games they are looking forward to suddenly disappear. Losing a highly anticipated fan remake doesn\u2019t just mean losing a game; it also damages trust in the fan-made game development community as a whole.\nOblivion Remastered Beat Skyblivion to the Punch\nThe release of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered had a big effect on the much-awaited fan-made remake, Skyblivion. The difference between these two projects shows how hard it is for volunteer-driven development to compete with professionally funded efforts. The difference in quality and development timelines is so clearly apparent.\nSkyblivion, a passion project started in 2012, tried to recreate Oblivion using Skyrim\u2019s game engine, a huge task that required years of work from a team of volunteers. On the other hand, Oblivion Remastered, announced and released in April 2025, had the full support of Bethesda and Virtuos, two well-known companies with plenty of experience and money.\nBoth are just remastering the game in their own ways, and a remake would take a lot more time, but the timing is significantly different. This gap in resources directly impacted development time. Skyblivion took over a decade to make, while Oblivion Remastered was developed much faster, having only started in 2021.\nThe difference in visuals between the two projects is obvious. Skyblivion tried to stay true to Skyrim's original style while using Skyrim\u2019s engine, making it look like a fan mod. Meanwhile, Oblivion Remastered, built in Unreal Engine 5, got a full graphical upgrade, improving the game\u2019s look completely. Basically, Oblivion Remastered feels like a modern version of a classic, something Skyblivion wanted to be.\nIn an unexpected way, the huge excitement around Skyblivion might have actually helped Oblivion Remastered\u2019s marketing. Years of hype for the fan project kept Oblivion in people\u2019s minds, making the official remaster a highly anticipated release.\nUnfortunately, the biggest problem with fan remakes is that the original team is usually able to outdo the fan project. If a studio sees a market for their remastered game, the studio might make more money doing it alone. We could see many Oblivion-style remasters after this.\nNow that there exists a polished official remaster of Oblivion, Skyblivion could struggle to capture the audience it had banked on. Even though the Skyblivion team has said they\u2019re still committed, having an official, easy-to-get, and more advanced version of the same game significantly reduces the chances of the fan project reaching a big audience."

      "text": "Summary\n- Stardew Valley was inspired by Harvest Moon, taking familiar elements and improving them.\n- Nintendo's lawsuit against Palworld for patent infringement may hurt creativity and competition.\n- Nintendo has a long history of using its money and power to stifle developers and others in the industry.\nPalworld was to Pok\u00e9mon what Stardew Valley was to Harvest Moon. These games took basic gameplay elements that seemed like they shouldn't be owned by any one group and improved the formula to make a better game.\nStardew Valley fans are lucky that Nintendo doesn't actually own Harvest Moon because, given Nintendo's Palworld lawsuits, their favorite farming sim might have run into trouble years ago.\nStardew Valley Was Inspired by Harvest Moon\nThe creation of Stardew Valley is closely tied to the Harvest Moon series, which has been around for a long time. The game\u2019s developer, ConcernedApe, has said that Harvest Moon was a big inspiration for him. He loved the series\u2019 cozy farm settings and the way it mixed farming with life simulation. However, he also felt that later Harvest Moon games weren\u2019t as good as the older ones because they became less creative, gave players fewer choices, and forced them through long, boring tutorials.\nThe classic Harvest Moon experience is all about running a farm. Players had to grow crops, raise animals, and get to know the people in town. These games move slowly, letting players take their time to build up their farm. Later games started adding more restrictions, like forcing players to follow a set story or making them go through long tutorials before they could really play. Stardew Valley fixes many of these issues. It keeps the same basic farming mechanics but makes everything smoother and easier to use.\nStardew Valley also balances its pacing well, mixing slow farming with other fun activities like exploring, crafting, and talking to villagers. It also adds extra things to do, like fishing, mining, and fighting monsters. The farming sim has benefited from Stardew Valley. However, it's arguable that the cozy sim genre owe its popularity to this indie hit.\nNintendo\u2019s Trademark Lawsuit Against Palworld Speaks Volumes\nNintendo\u2019s strong legal action against Pocketpair, the studio behind the monster-collecting game Palworld, shows how complicated and risky intellectual property protection can be in the video game industry. Stardew Valley received no lawsuit notices despite openly being inspired by Harvest Moon.\nThe lawsuit, which started in September 2024, wasn\u2019t about copyright issues, it was about patent infringement. This is an important difference because Nintendo didn\u2019t just go after obvious similarities in how characters or designs looked (which would be a copyright claim). Instead, it claimed that Palworld copied specific, patented game mechanics, like how monsters are caught and moved around.\nNot many would think that basic gameplay mechanics like movement would be the issue. Instead of fighting Palworld, Nintendo is fighting every game that is close to Pok\u00e9mon Legends because that's the company's venture into the 3D space. In my opinion, any company aggressively patenting basic gameplay ideas is bad for the gaming industry.\nNintendo\u2019s case focused on the similarities between Palworld\u2019s \"Pal Spheres\" and Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s Pok\u00e9 Balls and how players capture and interact with creatures. Nintendo argued that Palworld\u2019s systems worked too much like Nintendo\u2019s patented designs, making it an infringement.\nNintendo didn't go after Cassette Beasts, a game that looks and acts far more like Pok\u00e9mon than Palworld does. It went after Palworld, a very popular game that gave players the adult monster-catching game they wanted.\nNintendo chose to go after a successful franchise that could compete with its franchise, which reveals something about how the company thinks. In my opinion, it is less about stopping Palworld because of true infringement and more about making sure no one can enter a genre and compete with Pok\u00e9mon.\nEven Minecraft Wasn\u2019t Completely Original\nMinecraft was a huge success, but people often forget that its beginnings weren\u2019t all that original, just like Stardew Valley. Even though it became a groundbreaking game, its development history shows clear inspiration from earlier games. This proves how smart changes and unique design choices can turn familiar ideas into something completely fresh.\nMarkus \"Notch\" Persson, the creator of Minecraft, has openly admitted where the original concept came from. One major influence was a 2009 multiplayer game called Infiniminer, which randomly generated worlds of blocks that players could destroy.\nHowever, Minecraft wasn\u2019t just a copy of Infiniminer. Minecraft's brilliance came from taking Infiniminer\u2019s basic ideas and expanding upon them, adding key changes that made the game feel entirely different. Unlike Infiniminer, which was focused on competitive multiplayer, Minecraft started as a single-player game that emphasized exploration and creativity. Persson also mixed in elements from other types of games, like role-playing progression and survival challenges, adding features that Infiniminer didn\u2019t have, like the ability to host a server.\nMinecraft can't be played like Infiniminer, the same way Palworld can't be played like Pok\u00e9mon; they only look similar. It would be hard to imagine the Infiniminer creator suing Notch (if Infiniminer wasn't open source) just because some aspects are similar or because the concept inspired Minecraft.\nCompetition Isn\u2019t Bad Because Games Grow Through Imitation\nThe way video games develop over time is hardly ever a straight line of completely new ideas; Stardew Valley, Minecraft, SimCity, and more prove that. Instead, it\u2019s more like a back-and-forth mix of copying and improving, where popular games often become the starting point for future ones.\nGames like DOOM and Quake were groundbreaking in their time, but they set up basic mechanics that later games used as a foundation. Titles like Half-Life and Call of Duty took elements from those earlier games but added their own unique touches. Half-Life had story-driven gameplay, Call of Duty with its realistic military action and the rise of competitive online modes. Even though these games relied on existing ideas, they still managed to create their own style, making the shooter genre better.\nThis same pattern of borrowing and improving shows up in many types of games. Real-time strategy games, for instance, have changed a lot since Dune II first appeared. Later games like Command & Conquer and StarCraft kept the same basic RTS structure but added new features like different factions, high-tech units, and fresh gameplay twists. There are plenty of iconic games you didn't realize were knockoffs.\nCompetition isn\u2019t always a bad thing, it creates a cycle where developers take ideas from successful games, change them, and make them even stronger, is good for the industry. Unfortunately, Nintendo is huge and has used its power and connections to stifle competition before. To name a few examples listed from the Console Wars book by Blake J. Harris (one of the best books to learn the history of gaming):\n- Nintendo required third-party developers to sign agreements that severely restricted the number of games they could release a year for the NES. This forced developers to prioritize Nintendo's system over competing consoles, as they simply couldn't afford to release the same volume of games elsewhere.\n- Those same developers often had to agree not to release their games on other platforms (like Atari and later, Sega) for a certain period, giving Nintendo's platforms a significant content advantage. Developers gained almost nothing from this, and developers agreed because...\n- Nintendo was the sole manufacturer of NES cartridges, giving them significant control over supply. They could, and allegedly sometimes did, limit the number of cartridges available to developers who weren't fully compliant with their demands.\n- There have been allegations that Nintendo pressured retailers to give preferential shelf space to NES games and hardware, sometimes at the expense of competing systems.\n- Do you wonder why Nintendo products never get cheap? Nintendo was accused of (and even settled a price-fixing lawsuit over) colluding with retailers to ensure consumers paid a certain price for its products, regardless of how well they sold.\nNintendo put in patents after Palworld was released, meaning Nintendo did not own those gameplay elements, which is a fishy thing to do when a game becomes competition with one of your biggest IPs. It shows how far Nintendo will go to protect any property from true competition.\nI've named plenty of games that took basic elements and built upon them to form the industry we know today. If Stardew Valley or any of those games were scrutinized like this, they most likely would not have been made, or at the very least faced legal challenges that led to their shutdown."

      "text": "I can't be the only one who loves playing for high scores. It may seem like a throwback to the past when you were fighting to get on the Raiden II leaderboard at the arcade, but there are plenty of modern titles that keep the tradition alive.\n10 Celeste\nCeleste is a much-celebrated platformer that's available on almost anything. As with most platformers, \"100 percenting\" the game can be time-consuming, but there's a good reason to do so. The True Achievements Celeste leaderboard lists players on Xbox who have completed the game with a max score, but that's not the competitive part.\nThere are also rankings for Crystal Hearts and Strawberries that you can try to beat if you're superb at the game. If you're on PC or PS4, don't fret. You can still fight the speedrun Celeste board for the fastest game time, although the competition there is very stiff. This challenge isn't for the faint of heart, and your jumps should be on point if you intend to compete with the fastest times.\n9 Super Meat Boy Forever\nIf there were a leaderboard for the amount of time spent in a game, I'd probably be ranking on Super Meat Boy, but since there isn't. All I can hope for is placing on The Daily Grind Mode. In this mode, players get a randomly generated level that they have to run, but it's not all about speedrunning. It pits your time against the average time and factors in pacifiers and rank bonuses to give you a final score and a position on the leaderboard.\nIt might be one of the most frustrating games you can play if you're new to it, but once you settle into the groove, your precision platforming could pay off with your name in lights.\n8 Trackmania Nations Remake\nTrackmania has always been one of the best titles out there for high-score hunting, and while the number of people still playing Nations after its remake has died down somewhat, it's not completely dead. Moreover, with Trackmania Exchange supporting the title, it might be time to jump back into the games and see if you can best what's out there. There are still seasonal leaderboard updates and resets, so jumping into the latest season won't leave you too far behind the competition.\n7 Slay the Spire\nRoguelikes present a challenge for ranking players because of how random a single run can be. Slay the Spire somewhat \"fixes\" the randomness through its daily challenge system. Each day, the game offers players a unique challenge in the Daily Climb game mode. On completion, players are given the My Lucky Day achievement, and their score is sent to the in-game leaderboard.\nYou can browse the top scores and attempt more than one run, although your new score only gets submitted if it's better than the best one you previously submitted. for a game with so much playability, Daily Climb keeps me playing far longer than I should.\n6 Super Mario Maker 2\nSome people like running games, and some like making them. Super Mario Maker 2 is built for those who like both. The game offers Course World as a spot where players can compete for high scores on a series of player-created maps. Players get a few tabs that they can explore, including Endless Challenges of all difficulties, number of clears and first-clears, and world record holders, among other things.\nYou could make a level so frustrating that no one can clear it, but you'll have to clear it yourself before you submit it, keeping it somewhat fair. If you're a fan of old-school platformers or can just instinctively read Super Mario levels like a pro, you might be able to land on some of these leaderboards.\n5 Rocket League\nIf you like RC cars and soccer, you should already be playing Rocket League. The game has cross-platform play, but there are a few sites that can track your career and season achievements. The Rocket League Tracker Network allows login from any of the platforms you play on to keep track of your in-game achievements. It even comes with an in-game app with an overlay you can access while playing.\nRocket League Stats is more simplified, but you can also look up your current stats or track them via its overlay app. Since the stats themselves are publicly sourced information, the only difference is the flavor of tracker you choose to use.\n4 Binding of Issac: Rebirth\nAnother roguelike sensation that's incredibly hard to put down is Binding of Issac: Rebirth, especially the Daily Challenge mode. In the daily challenge, players start with a random seed that the whole run is based around. Your starting items, character, stage, difficulty, and ending level are all determined based on the random seed.\nOnce you complete your run, your score is submitted to the leaderboard. However, you can't have any mods active in-game, or your score won't count. Achievements are also disabled for challenge runs, but you can practice the run after your submission.\n3 Crypt of the Necrodancer\nThere are a lot of roguelikes that do the daily challenge thing, and Crypt of the Necrodancer is another cracker. If you're unfamiliar, this is a rhythm-based dungeon crawler where you need to stick to the beat while keeping track of enemy movements to rack up the best score.\nThe challenge is an All Zones run using Cadence, which resets daily at midnight (UTC +0). There are a few nuances compared to a standard All Zones run, but for the most part, it's an equal footing for all players trying it. Once you complete it, your score goes to the global leaderboard for the day. Since the board is also reset daily, you can keep trying for high scores and improve the game through each run.\n2 Neon White\nIf you want a leaderboard chase, first-person card-based speedrunning simulator Neon White's got you covered. The game offers a global leaderboard and a local one shared among your friends. Since it's been released on different platforms, each has its own leaderboard for obvious reasons: can you imagine trying to compete with a mouse-and-keyboard player while playing on a Nintendo Switch?\nWhat makes this game unique is that the leaderboard and time attack are an intrinsic part of the gameplay. It's not uncommon to finish a run and then reload the level because you want to shave a couple of milliseconds off your best time.\n1 Balatro\nIf you want ridiculous scores, deck-building poke-inspired roguelike Balatro is what you want to play. The Speedrun board for Balatro currently records the best times for completing the game, with some runs coming down as little as 1 minute and 48 seconds.\nArguably, beating the game fast isn't as fun as trying to rack up the highest score, but for now a Daily Challenge mode is missing from this title. Still, it's one of the best games you can gift, so if you're stuck on last-minute gift ideas, this might just be a great fit.\nIf you miss the days of chasing high scores or just want to throw yourself into a challenge that evolves, any of these games can be your jam. As with everything, practice makes perfect. Even if you're not ready to tackle leaderboards yet, the more you play, the better you'll get!"

      "text": "Summary\n- Palworld's gameplay mechanics closely resemble Pok\u00e9mon's, leading to Nintendo's patent infringement claim.\n- Nintendo's lawsuit against Palworld sets a dangerous precedent for gaming innovation since broad patent claims could stifle creativity and innovation in the gaming industry.\n- Pocketpair's future is uncertain because it faces a potential legal loss and gameplay changes.\nIt's understandable that companies like Nintendo want to protect their intellectual property, the company's targetting of Palworld sets a dangerous precedent. It suggests that even broad, seemingly innocuous game design elements can be patented, hurting innovation and creativity in the industry and making games worse for everyone.\nWhy Is Nintendo Suing Palworld?\nPalworld is a popular game where players catch monsters named Pals that help with survival and crafting. While many games have elements of monster collecting, the way that Palworld does it is very similar to Nintendo's Pok\u00e9mon monster-catching mechanics. In fact, building up to release \"Pok\u00e9mon with guns\" was thrown around more than once.\nThe lawsuit between Nintendo and Pocketpair, the creators of Palworld, centers around alleged patent infringement. Palworld is similar to Pok\u00e9mon, Nintendo's iconic franchise. Players in Palworld catch and train Pals to battle each other and explore a vibrant world that inhabits these Pals. The lawsuit, filed in the Tokyo District Court, claims Palworld infringes on multiple patents held by Nintendo and The Pok\u00e9mon Company.\nWhile Palworld launched in early access in January 2024, Nintendo waited until September to file the lawsuit. The reason for this delay is unclear, but it's possible Nintendo was taking their time to observe the game mechanics, build a case, and wait for the right moment to act. By delaying the lawsuit, Nintendo could have maximized its potential leverage, as Palworld had already established a significant player base and gained a good deal of money.\nWhy the Lawsuit Is So Concerning\nNintendo isn't alleging copyright infringement, but something worse. Copyright infringement protects original works like authorship, art, and the creative process. If this were the case, Pocketpair could easily switch out the models of the Pals with very little issue.\nIn gaming, patent and trademark infringement deals with the game's mechanics, systems, and even specific design choices in the gaming world. Copyright covers the expression of an idea, like the design of a Pok\u00e9mon (how a game looks), while a patent covers the underlying invention itself (how a game plays).\nIt would be straightforward for Nintendo to argue that Pals are just Pok\u00e9mon. You use a sphere to catch monsters, and a higher quality sphere gives you better chances to catch these monsters. You then train the monsters to battle other monsters and trainers, and they learn new techniques as they level up. The ultimate goal is to go to an arena and battle a leader who uses high-level monsters. Also, there's a rogue team of bandits that capture monsters for ill gain.\nTake the paragraph above and switch \"monsters\" with \"Pals,\" and you have Palworld, but if you switch it with \"Pok\u00e9mon,\" you have Pok\u00e9mon. The paragraph above lists game mechanics, and that's what Nintendo could sue Pocket Pair for. The key difference lies in the scope of protection.\nTwo of the best examples of why this is bad for the industry come from Bandai Namco and Warner Bros. The former is why we had to sit through boring loading screens when we were younger. Until 2015, Bandai Namco had a patent for adding little games to loading screens. These mini-games were separate from the main game and helped pass the time while you waited.\nThe Nemesis system from Warner Bros.' Shadow of Mordor generated unique and memorable enemy characters that remembered previous encounters and could react to the world and those in it uniquely. It is one of the best storytelling systems in a game, but it was patented. This means no other game can use a similar system unless they prove it is implemented differently. Unfortunately, the Nemesis system seems to have died with the Shadow of Mordor games since we haven't seen them since Shadow of War had a disastrous launch.\nThe result is that developers can't take these ideas and push them further, so gamers won't see cool systems and mechanics improve over time. In the end, both players and the industry as a whole are losers.\nWhat This Could Mean for Games Going Forward\nNintendo's lawsuit against Palworld, while seemingly focused on a single game, could have far-reaching implications for the gaming industry as a whole. This isn't about a single game \"copying\" Nintendo, this is about Nintendo trying to use the legal system to snuff out a real competitor.\nThis lawsuit, while perhaps justified from Nintendo's perspective, could have a chilling effect on innovation and competition. It's easy to see how developers might become hesitant to take risks and iterate on ideas if they fear being sued for infringing on broad and vaguely defined patents. Palworld gave players things they asked from Pok\u00e9mon for a long time but never received\u2014a mature version for an aging audience.\nBasically, Palworld is to Pok\u00e9mon what Stardew Valley is to Harvest Moon. Nintendo claims to love innovation, but mostly when it comes from Nintendo. Lawsuits like this will stop innovation because the risk of facing a lawsuit, even if ultimately unfounded, can be a major deterrent.\nIt's not just about the financial burden but also the time and resources spent defending against these claims. Developers might choose to focus on established genres and gameplay mechanics instead of taking something and making it better. Very few companies have the money to take on Nintendo in a world where every monster collector gets a lawsuit because it's kind of like Pok\u00e9mon.\nUltimately, the impact of this lawsuit will depend on how the legal system interprets patent law and how the industry reacts. While Warner Bros. and Bandai Namco made two pretty broad patents, we didn't see anyone challenge them by making a game with similar systems. We'll finally see how big of a deal it is when a company tries.\nPalworld's Chances Don't Look Good\nWhile we don't know the specifics of the patent infringement, one thing is clear: Nintendo doesn't throw around lawsuits lightly. The company has a history of fiercely protecting its intellectual property, and its willingness to pursue legal action against Palworld suggests a strong belief in its case.\nIf Nintendo successfully proves that Palworld infringes on its patents, it could force the developers to change the game drastically. The game's core gameplay loop revolves around capturing and training creatures, a mechanic undeniably inspired by Pok\u00e9mon. If it's everything related to Pok\u00e9mon, then Pocketpair would have to strip away the very element that drew many players to Palworld in the first place.\nThe loss of the Pok\u00e9mon-esque system will leave Palworld as a generic crafting survival game. That's a genre that is already saturated with competitors. While Palworld offers unique features like gunplay and a crafting system, the charming monster collection aspect sets it apart. Without it, it's hard to see how Palworld could compete in the survival genre.\nThe success of Palworld ended up being a double-edged sword for Pocketpair. On the one hand, the game's success has helped the studio immensely, but that attention is likely what brought the ire of a legal juggernaut like Nintendo. However, we've seen even giants like Google lose when it came to lawsuits over competition.\nIf Pocketpair wins, we will easily see more games attempt to improve on features that could be patented. However, if Pocketpair loses, this is a big stake in the heart of the monster-collecting genre. Also, if Pocketpair has to abandon its core gameplay loop, it risks losing what makes Palworld stand out.\nThe potential loss of its unique selling point, on top of legal fees, leaves Palworld's future uncertain, highlighting the high stakes in this legal battle. But far greater than that are the implications that such a lawsuit will have on the wider industry in the future."

      "url": "https://www.howtogeek.com/659948/what-are-aaa-triple-a-video-games/",
      "text": "Quick Links\nYou might have heard the term AAA or Triple-A video games before. These are big-budget titles that you see commercials for on TV. Here's what they are, and how they shape the gaming industry.\nBlockbuster Movies, But for Games\nYou've probably watched a blockbuster movie before. Blockbusters typically have large budgets, production teams of thousands of people, big-name actors, and recognizable film studios producing them. Also, they tend to make tons of money, with more and more movies crossing the billion-dollar mark every year. AAA (or Triple-A) video games are to the gaming world what blockbusters are for the film industry.\nJust like blockbusters, they usually involve huge teams working for months to years to make a finished product, employed by a major studio. This is normally followed by a big marketing campaign with ads that show up everywhere, as well as a long preorder so people can get the game as soon as it comes out. These games are then distributed by a large well-known publisher, such as Nintendo, Sony, Activision, or Electronic Arts.\nMany Triple-A titles are also part of popular franchises. Much like the way a studio like Disney or Warner Bros. creates movies with their significant properties every year, there are some game series that release titles every few years or even yearly. Call of Duty, Battlefield, Mario, and FIFA are all series with regular new installments that frequently beat their own sales records.\nTriple-A Games Versus Other Games\nSo, how do you tell if a game counts as Triple-A? Without even knowing the game's studio, the first identifier is its launch price. Nowadays, a standard major title is sold both digitally and physically at $60 upon launch in the United States, with that amount varying between different regions and countries. While this price will certainly go down over time due to sales and bundles, nearly all major releases start at this amount. This doesn't even include things like a season pass or launch day downloadable content (DLC), which can add to its price upon purchase.\nNext is the game's scale. While there are undoubtedly many ambitious and expansive non-AAA titles out there, the limited budget often becomes a hindering factor for smaller games. Many Triple-A games such as Red Dead Redemption, The Witcher, and Grand Theft Auto have thousands of hours of content and open maps that emphasize exploration. They also frequently have boundary-pushing graphical quality and animation.\nAnother visible indicator is the size of the team. If a game's credits have thousands of people and multiple gaming companies working on it, it's very likely to be a major studio release. Due to the scale and intensity, game publishers often outsource certain aspects of the game, such as 3D animation, modeling, sound design, and online connectivity to third-party contractors.\nOn the opposite side of the coin are independent games, colloquially known as indie games, which are independently financed and made by small teams. Some famous indie games, such as Minecraft and Stardew Valley, were made almost entirely by one person. They usually are shorter, less graphically intensive, and are priced much lower than Triple-A titles, with many of them being sold between $10 to $40. Many of them also don't have a physical release, opting for pure digital distribution.\nA subset of these games, known as III or Triple-I titles, are large-scale productions with expansive concepts that are made by an independent studio. Games such as Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, No Man's Sky, and The Witness are all high-quality titles developed by indie game studios.\nWhat Are \"Triple-A Plus\" Games?\nIn recent years, game journalists have also coined the term AAA+ or Triple-A plus. These are titles with especially large budgets that are sold at a premium price, and often have additional monetization inside the game. Examples of these include season passes, DLC, and microtransactions.\nYearly game franchises, like FIFA and Call of Duty, are often explicitly designed to have additional purchases built-in. Call of Duty is sold with a season pass that players have to buy to play new campaigns that are distributed throughout the year.\nFIFA, on the other hand, has a microtransaction system where you can open loot boxes to unlock various versions of football players to assemble a team. They recently announced that they'd made over a billion dollars in total microtransaction revenues.\nThe Future of Gaming\nAs the gaming community continues to grow, so will the gaming industry. More and more major franchise games are being released every year, and while many of them are great, there are some causes for concern. These include the pervasiveness of additional monetization to already expensive games, as well as the tendency of studios to release very similar games every year.\nFortunately, indie gaming enterprises are also growing. The most popular game in the world, Minecraft, was made by a small gaming studio set up by one person. The ubiquity of digital downloading and the rise of platforms like Steam and GOG have made great affordable titles more accessible than ever."

      "text": "Summary\n- Bullet hell games are a sub-genre of shoot-em-up with intense projectile density and one-hit deaths.\n- The line between regular schmup and bullet hell can be blurry, gradually ramp up to the \"hell\" setting.\n- Bullet hell games offer a flow experience where players can get into the zone despite quick deaths.\nLike most people, I have certain video game genres that are my comfort food. However, I try to step outside of my gaming comfort zone from time to time, and over the last few years I've been dipping my toes in the broad \"bullet hell\" genre of games, which have turned out to be much more interesting than I thought,\nWhat\u2019s a Bullet Hell Game Exactly?\nThe bullet hell genre is surprisingly hard to pin down exactly. At its core, this is a sub-genre of shoot-em-up or \"schmup\" games. Think of titles like R-type, Ikaruga, Raptor: Call of the Shadows, Twin-Bee and many more. You control a ship or something like it in a vertical or horizontal game field, shooting at enemies as you try to avoid being shot.\nBullet hell games are basically this, but the number of projectiles are increased to a ridiculous degree. Couple that with the fact that you usually die in one hit, and the main aim of the game is not so much to shoot enemies, but to simply survive. Keeping your character or vehicle in the one safe spot on screen, which constantly shifts as the game unfolds.\nThese days, the bullet hell genre is often crossed with other styles of game to make something unique. Bullet hell roguelikes seem to be the most common crossover. Also, these games may not be limited to a 2D plane as with pure classic bullet hell titles. For example, Returnal is a roguelite bullet hell game that's played as an over-the-shoulder third-person shooter.\nIt turns out that some people even consider the later stages of Diablo II, one of my all-time favorites, to essentially be a bullet hell game.\nThere Are Degrees of Hell in Bullet Hell Games\nAs I alluded to before, the line between regular schmup and bullet hell can be fuzzy,. Certainly, by the later stages of some schmups at higher difficulty levels, the game functionally becomes a bullet hell title. I guess that the \"true\" bullet hell titles are those that are designed to offer the \"bullet curtain\" (danmaku) experience from the outset.\nNonetheless, it may be a good idea to try your hand at standard schmups first to see if you have a taste for it, then gradually ramp it up to the \"hell\" setting.\nBullet Hell Games Are Some of the Best for Achieving Flow\nLet's get one thing straight: I am not very good at bullet hell games. However, I've never felt like I had to be good at a genre of games to enjoy them. I'm not great at first-person shooters either, but I still enjoy playing them.\nMy dabbling in bullet hell games has usually led to quick deaths, but every now and then, when I'm in the zone, it all comes together for a while. I sort of zone out and try not to think too hard about moving my ship or character around, and it sort of works at a subconscious level. Until it doesn't, of course. I've really become a little disillusioned with modern games, and there's something about schmups and bullet hell games that's pure on a visceral level. No filler, no quicktime events, just your wits.\nGreat Bullet Hell Titles to Get You Started\nOur friends over at Game Rant have put together a list of the best bullet hell games, and I've only tried a handful of titles since I became interested, but a few titles seem to pop up in every conversation about these games.\nDeathsmiles seems to be a common recommendation for people looking for a beginner's bullet hell. Of course, another favorite of mine, Nier Automata, has heavy elements of bullet hell in segments of the game, known for its liberal flipping of game genres while you play.\nVampire Survivors is also a bullet hell, though the \"bullets\" in this case are creatures of the night. Other notable titles include Asterogues, Jamestown+ and Nuclear Throne. Also, who can forget Cuphead? Of course, the Touhou games might be what first clued people in to the genre in the West, but these games are in Japanese, so if you care about the plot, they might not be for you.\nBullet hell games are so diverse and have so many unique gameplay twists, that there's sure to be one that clicks with you, all you have to do is be willing to try."

      "url": "https://www.howtogeek.com/games-where-you-arent-the-main-hero/",
      "text": "Chances are that most of your favorite games involve you being the main hero of the story. Perhaps the playable character is meant to save the world, or maybe they have a unique talent or ability that no one else has.\nBut what about the games where that responsibility falls to someone else? While it's empowering to have such greatness thrust upon you, some of the most satisfying games are the ones where you impact the world indirectly or enable someone else to do so.\nThis article contains some spoilers for the listed games.\n10 The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion's intro is beyond incredible, both in presentation and how it eases you into its world. Your journey begins in a prison cell, and it just so happens the king is secretly leaving the castle through a passageway only accessible from your cell. Upon meeting you, he remarks on how he's seen you in his dreams and beckons you to come with. This has all the makings of you being a type of chosen one, but in actuality that role belongs to the king's illegitimate son, Martin.\nYour journey throughout Cyrodil revolves around finding Martin and the events that unfold afterward. It's unfair to say your character isn't influential, since you're even recognized in-game as the \"Hero of Kvatch,\" but Martin is the key to Cyrodil's future, while you play a more supportive role.\nLuckily, if you've never played, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered was simultaneously announced and released in April 2025, and makes a compelling case as to why the gaming world needs more shadow drops.\n9 Final Fantasy X\nThe funny thing about Final Fantasy X is how the game emphasizes its events being Tidus' story, despite that not entirely being the case. Tidus may be a main character, but he is a guardian to Yuna, a summoner embarking on her pilgrimage to obtain the power needed to save the world. Specifically, Yuna travels across all of Spira to help bring about the Calm, a period of respite from the calamity known as Sin.\nMake no mistake, Tidus is imperative to the story, especially given his ties to several plot-critical characters. What happens in the game's climax is due to his influence, and he\u2019s undoubtedly a hero, but the narrative is primarily focused on Yuna. You spend a good chunk of the game accompanying her from temple to temple as she acquires more power in the form of Aeons, and the game cannot move forward without her.\n8 Legend of Mana\nLegend of Mana features a silent protagonist as the player character, who can be either male or female. The Mana Tree, which provides mana and life for the entire world, burned down hundreds of years before the game begins. The protagonist wishes to restore the world and does so by aiding certain characters throughout three main quest arcs, as well as a final arc.\nNotably, there is no information given about your character, and their silent nature provides no clues about their personality or background. They serve more as an enabler and support for the other characters in the story, who all play a crucial role in restoring the Mana Tree.\n7 The Last of Us Part I\nDespite only controlling her for a brief period of time (in the first game, at least), Ellie is the main hero in The Last of Us Part I. Similar to Final Fantasy X, you play as a bodyguard basically the entire game. After it is discovered that Ellie is the only known person immune to the Cordyceps infection that has devastated the world, Joel is hired to protect her. Your goal is to regroup with the Fireflies, a faction that aims to reverse-engineer a vaccine capable of curing those who become infected.\nJoel is anything but virtuous, and even calling him a hero is a stretch considering how cynical and ruthless he is. As you travel throughout the game, you discover that Joel has killed many people. At one point in his life, he and his brother were no better than raiders, frequently setting traps to murder and rob anyone unfortunate enough to pass.\nJoel is certainly a main character, but he definitely isn't a hero. Everything in The Last of Us Part I revolves around Ellie and the potential influence she can have on the world.\n6 Halo 3: ODST\nThe fact your in-game character is known as \"Rookie\" in Halo 3: ODST (an Xbox game you probably never played, but should) tells you everything you need to know about your role in the story. Though Rookie is the main character, the bulk of the game is actually experienced through a series of flashbacks.\nThe story begins in New Mombasa as he awakens after being knocked unconscious from his bumpy landing. You then scour the city to try and find different beacons, each of which is associated with one of his squadmates in some way. Upon discovering a beacon, you take control of the comrade in question to piece together what happened while Rookie was out cold.\nNot only do you play as multiple characters throughout the Halo 3: ODST's campaign, you are noticeably weaker than series protagonist Master Chief due to being an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper. That's not to say that shock troopers in the Halo universe can't be heroic, but Rookie's exploits aren't noteworthy in the long-run.\n5 Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age\nVaan is interesting in that he is a main character in Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age, but not necessarily critical to the story's narrative. Beginning the story as nothing more than a street urchin, Vaan gets swept up in a conflict between the Kingdom of Dalmasca and the Archadian Empire. Ashe, heir to the Dalmascan throne, heads a resistance movement to fend off the Archadians and reclaim her throne. Vaan's companions, particularly Ashe, Balthier, and Basch, are all key players regarding what befalls Ivalice. Even Balthier comments about how he's the \"leading man\" of the story.\nIn the grand scheme of things, Vaan is more of an external observer, or a self-insert of the player into the game's universe. His relative ignorance of the world provides easy ways for other characters to explain what's going on to him without the player getting lost. He does help advance the plot and has many important moments in the story, but the greater focus is on Ashe and her goal of liberating Dalmasca.\n4 Xenoblade Chronicles X\nXenoblade Chrnoicles X begins with you creating an avatar character, known by default as Cross. As the game begins, you're awakened by Elma, the leader of BLADE (Builders of the Legacy After the Destruction of Earth) and brought back to New Los Angeles. Before you know it, Cross becomes a member of BLADE under Elma's command and embarks on a number of missions and adventures.\nThough the missions you take part in have a monumental impact on the world, you are ultimately a part of Elma's team. Elma's squadmates contribute in large ways, but she is the narrative's primary focus and what occurs in the story would not occur without her.\n3 Fire Emblem: Awakening\nIn Fire Emblem: Awakening, the avatar character (canonically known as Robin) plays a pivotal role in the story, but is still second to Chrom and Lucina. A descendant of the Hero King, Marth, Chrom is Ylisse\u2019s prince who leads a vigilante group known as the Shepherds that protect the kingdom. Chrom finds Robin passed out in a field and suffering from amnesia, who then travels with the Sheperds, serving as their strategist.\nThings get more complicated once Lucina, Chrom's daughter from the future, makes an appearance to prevent her father from being killed as he was in her time. I'll refrain from spoiling the story too heavily, but Robin is certainly an integral part of the plot. When Robin's identity is revealed, he does become a focal point, but Chrom and Lucina are still the ones taking center stage as they save the present and the future together.\n2 Final Fantasy Tactics\nFinal Fantasy Tactics may seem like an odd inclusion on this list, but according to the in-game records, the main character is a heretic. Ramza Beoulve was born into the respected House Beoulve and, despite his position as a noble, he quickly became friends with Delita Heiral, a commoner. While Ramza initially fights to honor and uphold his family name, his motivations change once he sees how twisted and unfair the world truly is, particularly to people like Delita.\nRamza and Delita represent two very different lines of thinking and methods of making the world a better place. Delita believes it is acceptable to manipulate others to bring about good and Ramza tries to achieve that same end through virtuous means, no matter what.\nBoth characters seek to change society for the better, but Ramza's methods are more overt, resulting in the church branding him a heretic. Meanwhile, Delita eventually becomes king, courtesy of his cunning and scheming. Ramza eventually saves all of Ivalice, but his deeds and identity are almost completely omitted from history, so he technically isn't a hero at all.\n1 Gothic\nGothic is a brutal RPG where you begin as a nobody and the world is actively trying to take advantage of you. The game starts with your character being sentenced to a mining colony as a prisoner for an unmentioned crime. Before serving your time, you receive a letter and are instructed to deliver it to the Order of the Magicians of Fire, a task that begins your journey.\nAs Gothic's plot progresses, you do become reputable, however. I'll avoid spoilers, but there is a reason the game refers to the main character as the Nameless Hero. Nonetheless, it is an arduous adventure and one where it takes an inordinate amount of work for other characters to even acknowledge you, much less refer to you as heroic.\nThough it's nice to be the main hero of a story, sometimes it's just as satisfying to be along for the ride. Many of the best games around are the ones where your actions may not have directly changed the world, but helped those whose actions could. Whether it's for a friend or to protect someone even more dear to you, the emotional impact of being there for them outweighs the pride of saving the world any day of the week."

If you end up enjoying AI: The Somnium Files, you'll be glad to hear that the game received a sequel in 2022 and has a third entry arriving later this year.\nAI: The Somnium Files\n- OpenCritic Reviews\n- Top Critic Avg: 82/100 Critics Rec: 89%\n- Released\n- July 25, 2019\n- ESRB\n- t\n- Developer(s)\n- Spike Chunsoft\n- Publisher(s)\n- Spike Chunsoft, Limited Run Games\n9 428: Shibuya Scramble\nMost visual novels are already long-winded and complicated enough with just one protagonist, but 428: Shibuya Scramble presents its convoluted tale through the lenses of five different people whose paths frequently collide in unexpected ways.\nTrying to explain the plot of 428 would take a while, so let's just introduce the game's five unlikely heroes: Kano, a rookie detective racing against the clock to rescue a kidnapped girl; Achi, a gangleader-turned-environmentalist helping another girl flee from a mysterious assassin; Minorikawa, a freelance journalist battling deadlines and evading thugs to save his former boss from crippling debt; Osawa, a reclusive virologist who discovers a deadly conspiracy being carried out within his pharmaceutical company; and Tama, a part-timer struggling to reach the zipper on the back of her costume.\nAt any point, you can swap between the five protagonists to progress their individual stories, but you will have to frequently jump between each character to reach the best possible ending. As you advance through each of their plotlines, you'll frequently make decisions that can influence future events for both your current character and any of the other protagonists. Even the most seemingly inconsequential choices can have severe consequences for the other characters. For example, Tama can end up indirectly responsible for other characters' deaths by simply handing out a free drink or choosing to fight a cockroach.\nEach of the game's five interconnected storylines are equally entertaining from start to finish, and the overarching plot they form is a captivating mystery that never takes itself too seriously. If you're looking for a fast-paced visual novel with a consistently thrilling story, you should definitely check out 428.\n8 The Silver Case\nThe Silver Case won't be the last murder mystery game to appear on this list, but it's certainly the most bizarre. Set in an alternate version of 1990s Japan, The Silver Case contains two different stories centered around a terrifying serial killer named \"Kamui.\" The first story follows the Heinous Crimes Unit (HCU), a group of detectives assigned to track down and arrest Kamui, only to get involved in a deeper mystery involving a cryptic message: \"Kill the Past.\" The second story centers around Tokio Morishima, a struggling reporter whose investigations into Kamui's history send him spiraling down a dark rabbit hole of paranoia and personal traumas.\nEvery aspect of The Silver Case is drenched in a moody style and chilling atmosphere. UI elements such as the 90s computer-inspired menus and the detailed character portraits give the game a cold, often disconcerting tone. The dreary environments you explore throughout the game reflect the same feeling, frequently placing you in dark areas with total silence while you hunt for Kamui or the remains of his victims. However, the game is more than just doom and gloom, often mixing in other visual mediums such as live action footage and anime cutscenes for dramatic moments.\nMake no mistake: The Silver Case has plenty of substance to accompany its style. Nearly everyone in its large cast of characters feels like a real person, with many of them having subtle flaws and vulnerabilities that humanize even the harshest personalities.\nThe Silver Case is only the first chapter in a trilogy and was followed by Flower, Sun, and Rain and The 25th Ward: The Silver Case. Both The Silver Case and The 25th Ward have been ported to modern platforms, though Flower, Sun, and Rain is still stuck on the Nintendo DS and a Japan-exclusive PlayStation 2 release.\n7 VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action\nVA-11 Hall-A is set in a bleak cyberpunk future ruled by crime and corruption, taking place in a city where shootouts and political unrest are part of the daily routine. It's a world full of biker gangs, armored police squads, and underground hackers, but they aren't the focus of this story.\nInstead, VA-11 Hall-A places you in the role of an ordinary bartender in a not-so-special dive bar, where you'll be mixing drinks and socializing with a colorful cast of memorable characters. Your clients include eccentric figures such as a sunglasses-sporting Shiba Inu, a flirtatious human brain in a jar, and a few guest appearances from another cyberpunk indie game. As you become more acquainted with these characters, you'll learn more about their lives, their ongoing struggles, and\u2014of course\u2014their taste in drinks. You'll also play a major part in their stories, as the drinks you serve will also affect your relationship with each character and potentially alter the outcome of their stories.\nWhile it may not provide the same level of excitement or suspense as other games on this list, VA-11 Hall-A makes up for its lack of action with its masterful writing. Sometimes VA-11 Hall-A is a wonderfully cozy experience, letting you relax with its charming cast as they indulge in their shared escapism. Other times, it's an emotional tale about running from the past, facing your regrets, and finding a reason to move forward with your life. Across your many shifts in VA-11 Hall-A, you'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll probably need a drink by the end.\nVA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action\n- OpenCritic Reviews\n- Top Critic Avg: 84/100 Critics Rec: 89%\n- Released\n- August 16, 2014\n- ESRB\n- t\n- Developer(s)\n- Sukeban Games, Wolfgame\n6 Slay the Princess\nYou can probably tell by the name that Slay the Princess is not your typical fairytale love story. You are a hero on a quest to save the world, but the only way to accomplish that is by entering an isolated cabin and killing the princess locked inside. Regardless of how this story ends\u2014whether it's with your death or hers\u2014the world will reset, and you'll find yourself back at the beginning. It soon becomes clear that you're trapped in a time loop, and the only way to break free is to slay\u2014or save\u2014the princess once and for all.\nEach loop will have you making moment-to-moment decisions as you pick what to say to the princess, when to attack, or possibly go against your mission and spare her\u2014assuming she doesn't kill you first. Along the way, you'll also be accompanied by the narrator and a secondary voice\u2014whose personality changes with each loop\u2014and they will attempt to guide you towards certain choices (though not always the best ones) when they're not too busy bickering with each other.\nMost routes in Slay the Princess begin as a dark comedy before eventually morphing into full-fledged horror, yet the game manages to deliver a heartfelt story across each of its multiple endings. The game also received a free update titled The Pristine Cut, adding new routes and endings to the story.\nYour comment has not been saved\nSlay the Princess\n- OpenCritic Reviews\n- Top Critic Avg: 90/100 Critics Rec: 96%\n- Released\n- October 23, 2023\n- ESRB\n- nr\n- Engine\n- ren'py\n5 Gnosia\nGnosia places you in a spaceship alongside 15 colorful characters, only to learn that a few members of this eccentric cast aren't who they claim to be. A few members within your group are \"Gnosia,\" a hostile alien species that blends in with the crew to wipe out humanity. The only way to stop the Gnosia is by sealing them in cryosleep, but that's easier said than done when they're almost indistinguishable from regular humans. With no other options, you and the crew vote to select one member of the crew to seal away.\nBased on the premise, you probably won't be surprised to hear that Gnosia is heavily inspired by games like Werewolf and Among Us, but that influence extends beyond its story. Gnosia is essentially a single-player social deduction in which the other characters are controlled by the computer. That may sound odd, considering that the whole appeal of social deduction games comes from the \"social\" aspect, but Gnosia's solo reimagining of the genre is surprisingly addictive. Instead of finding clues to solve the murder, you'll need to pay attention to each character's subtle habits and personality quirks. Each character has different personality stats that determine how others respond to them during conversations.\nMuch like a certain princess-slaying adventure, Gnosia also takes place in a time loop. Across each loop, the number of crew members and their respective roles will change. Characters that appear as humans in one round may be Gnosia in the next. They may also appear in other roles that can help or hinder the human crew, but the Gnosia can also falsely assume these roles to blend in. You may also be thrown into one of these other roles, allowing you to scan characters as an engineer or work against the crew as one of the Gnosia.\nYour comment has not been saved\n4 Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney\nThe Ace Attorney franchise has been going strong since 2001, but it's never been easier to jump in. Nearly every major mainline entry and spinoff is now available on modern platforms thanks to recent re-releases. All the Ace Attorney games are worth playing, but there's still no better place to start than the very beginning.\nPhoenix Wright: Ace Attorney\u2014the first entry in the Ace Attorney franchise\u2014has you taking on the role and shiny badge of the eponymous defense attorney. Across multiple increasingly complex cases, you will need to defend your client by gathering evidence and presenting your findings in court. Each case is split into two sections: a point-and-click investigation period during which you gather clues and meet with an eccentric cast of characters connected to the case, and the dramatic courtroom trials that involve presenting your evidence while cross-examining witnesses on the stand.\nDespite its age, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is a timeless murder mystery classic. Each of its five cases is packed with likable characters, engrossing storylines, and an amazing soundtrack. Even compared to later entries, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is one of the best installments in the franchise, and it's still my personal favorite of the mainline entries.\nYour comment has not been saved\nPhoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy\n- OpenCritic Reviews\n- Top Critic Avg: 82/100 Critics Rec: 86%\n- Released\n- February 7, 2012\n- ESRB\n- T For Teen Due To Use of Tobacco, Blood, Suggestive Themes, Violence\n- Developer(s)\n- Capcom\n- Publisher(s)\n- Capcom\n3 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors\nAfter being abducted by a masked figure named \"Zero,\" you and a group of eight other survivors wake up in a mysterious cruise ship with numbered bracelets strapped to your wrists and remote bombs implanted in your intestines. The only way to escape is by progressing through a series of elaborate escape rooms within the next nine hours. However, escaping the ship won't be as simple as it sounds, and you will have to repeatedly die and try again to seek a way out.\nThis is the basic premise of 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, but its story rapidly escalates across multiple playthroughs. In between solving puzzles and unlocking new areas of the ship, you'll frequently make decisions that can drastically alter the events of the story and lead to different endings. With each story route, you'll gradually learn more about the other survivors and their secretive ties to Zero's true identity.\nEven if you don't enjoy escape rooms or puzzle games, 999's complex, twist-filled story makes it a must-play visual novel. Fair warning: expect to run into lots of math problems\u2014I hope you know how to count in hexadecimal.\nAlthough it was originally written to be a standalone story, the original success of 999 spawned the rest of the Zero Escape trilogy. The second game, Virtue's Last Reward, continues the story with even more mind-blowing plot twists and some extremely challenging puzzles. The third game, Zero Time Dilemma, is considerably more divisive among fans, but it maintains the quality puzzles and storytelling of the prior entries.\nYour comment has not been saved\nZero Escape: The Nonary Games\n- OpenCritic Reviews\n- Top Critic Avg: 85/100 Critics Rec: 91%\n- Released\n- March 24, 2017\n- ESRB\n- Mature 17+ // Blood, Drug Reference, Sexual Themes, Strong Language, Violence\n- Developer(s)\n- Spike Chunsoft\n- Publisher(s)\n- Spike Chunsoft\n2 Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc\nAmong visual novels, the Danganronpa series has always been one-of-a-kind. Even for stories with dramatic plot twists and constantly high stakes like 428: Shibuya Scramble and the Zero Escape Series, reading a visual novel is usually a relaxing experience. Some horror visual novels will keep you on edge with their tense atmospheres, but even those are a lot calmer than most other gaming genres. The best parts of Danganronpa deliver nerve-wracking, pulse-pounding thrills with their energetic twist on classic murder mysteries.\nDanganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc follows Makoto Naegi, an ordinary high-schooler who wins a raffle to enroll in the prestigious Hope's Peak Academy, and is consequentially dubbed the \"Ultimate Lucky Student.\" That luck soon runs out when Makoto and fourteen other students are captured by a robotic bear named Monokuma and forced to participate in a vicious killing game. What follows a series of shocking murder mysteries and a search for the sadistic mastermind behind the killing game.\nFollowing a formula inspired by the Ace Attorney series, Trigger Happy Havoc features multiple cases divided into investigation segments and \"class trials.\" The investigations are composed of the usual point-and-click format of searching for clues and gathering information from the surviving students, but the \"Class Trials\" are where Trigger Happy Havoc truly shines, transforming the courtroom into an eclectic series of minigames. Each class trial alternates between a first-person shooter in which you fire \"truth bullets\" at contradictions, a game of hangman to uncover important answers to lingering mysteries, a climactic rhythm game duel against the lead suspect, and a puzzle game finale in which you piece together the events of the murder.\nTrigger Happy Havoc's murder mysteries aren't very difficult, and it doesn't take long to figure out who's the killer in each case. Despite this, Danganronpa's energetic class trials and off-beat humor make every case incredibly fun to solve.\nYour comment has not been saved\nDanganRonpa: Trigger Happy Havoc\n- OpenCritic Reviews\n- Top Critic Avg: 86/100 Critics Rec: 100%\n- Released\n- November 25, 2010\n- ESRB\n- m // Blood, Intense Violence, Strong Language, Suggestive Themes\n- Developer(s)\n- Spike\n- Publisher(s)\n- Spike\n- Engine\n- Unity\n1 The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy\nThe Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is a true passion project; a behemoth of a visual novel that aims to fit every possible idea its creators concocted into a single, absurdly massive story. It's a murder mystery, a strategy RPG, a horror story, a dating sim, a sci-fi thriller, a slice-of-life drama, and so much more stuffed into a story with 100 unique endings.\nThe Hundred Line tells the story of a group of fifteen high-schoolers enrolled in the Last Defense Academy, a mysterious facility seemingly designed to prepare the students to battle against an invasive alien species. For 100 days, the students are tasked with training and defending the academy from the seemingly endless onslaught of invaders. Along the way, their daily lives in the academy head into a series of dangerous, shocking, or downright bizarre events, depending on your choices throughout the story.\nMost of your time with The Hundred Line will be split between turn-based strategy battles against the invaders, and free time segments wherein you can improve your relationships with the other students and train them to strengthen their combat skills. You can also use your free time to collect materials by exploring different areas through an elaborate board game.\nThe main appeal of The Hundred Line is its expansive branching story. After a linear first playthrough\u2014which mainly serves as a tutorial\u2014the game opens up with the ability to make different choices that lead into a multitude of different story routes. The Hundred Line regularly flies off into bizarre new directions and entire genre shifts, constantly finding new ways to blindside you with absurd and unpredictable scenarios.\nIf you've been avoiding visual novels for any reason, it may be time to give them a second chance. While the visual novels on this list are perfect for anyone who's new to the genre, there are many more amazing games that are worth playing.\nMystery classics like Umineko: When They Cry and The House in Fata Morgana are just as inventively mind-bending and engrossing as any of the games on this list. Horror visual novels like The Letter and the Spirit Hunter series are similarly worthwhile for fans of tense, atmospheric experiences. Finally, some of the most famous games in the genre like Fate/stay night and CLANNAD are still fondly remembered for a reason.\nYour comment has not been saved"

      "text": "Summary\n- Indie developers pour their hearts, time, and money into games, offering unique experiences filled with personality despite the challenges they face from tight budgets and poor discoverability.\n- Indie game development allows for creative freedom, allowing them to take risks that result in unique gameplay mechanics and storytelling techniques often absent in mainstream titles.\n- Despite challenges like limited resources and visibility, indie developers continue to create innovative and enjoyable games for players.\nIndie games like Stardew Valley and Hades have become some of the biggest hits in gaming, but the world of indie development is quite different from that of big-budget triple-A releases. Here's what smaller indie developers want their fans to know about the industry as it currently stands.\nThe Driving Force Behind Developing a Game\nI am a solo indie developer, having completed a few games (I most recently submitted to the GMTK Game Jam 2024). My insights come from personal experience talking with gamers, and discussions with other indie game developers in my professional circle.\nDue to my position, I have a healthy respect for indie game developers. But there are many things that indie developers don't typically disclose to their audience. Sometimes, it's because they think the audience knows already, but other times, it's because they're too busy trying to get stuff to work.\nA Labor of Love\nIndie developers pour their hearts, time, and often their own money into creating games. Unlike large studios backed by significant funding, these creators must balance shoestring budgets and sometimes juggle other jobs to bring their visions to life. This personal involvement results in games that are deeply personal and crafted with immense passion.\nFor players, this means every indie game represents a labor of love. The developers are not just looking to make a profit; they are sharing a piece of their soul. When you pick up an indie game, you're experiencing something unique, often reflecting the developer's personal experiences, dreams, and creative expression.\nNo Studio Constraints\nOne of the most exciting aspects of indie game development is the creative freedom it allows. Unlike larger studios that might shy away from more experimental ideas due to financial risk, indie developers have fewer constraints holding them back. This freedom leads to unique gameplay mechanics, unconventional storytelling, and stylized visuals that stand out in the gaming landscape. Sometimes, a lack of support from a large studio means disastrous launches, but those are things a game can recover from.\nFor gamers, indie games can deliver a diverse range of experiences that might not be possible with mainstream titles. Indie games offer fresh perspectives and gameplay hooks that challenge traditional gaming norms, providing players with something new and exciting.\nIt's a Tough Road Being an Indie Developer\nDeveloping a game means wearing many \"hats.\" Sometimes, you have to be a game designer, sometimes a 3D model creator, and other times a programmer. Aside from these challenges, there are a few more things that come up in the world of indie game development that most players never notice.\nGame Development Is Pretty Expensive\nTriple-A studios invest millions of dollars in a new title. Indie devs often find themselves with a small salary and the lint they gathered at the bottom of their jeans pockets. Without the vast budgets of major studios, indie developers must maximize every dollar and every hour they invest.\nPlayers might not realize that every aspect of an indie game, from art and music to programming and marketing, is often handled by a small team or even a single individual. This constraint can lead to longer development times and the need for careful resource management. The next time you see an indie game, remember all the funding required to make one of them.\nGetting Eyes on Your Product\nOne of the biggest problems for indie developers is getting players to notice their product. There are thousands of games being developed and released each year. A lot of this is shovelware like asset flips from well-known game engines, with a few diamonds that truly deserve recognition. Even the most innovative and well-crafted indie games can go unnoticed without effective marketing and community support.\nFor players, this means that discovering hidden gems can require a bit more effort. Word of mouth, reviews, and recommendations play a crucial role in bringing these games to a wider audience. By actively supporting and promoting indie titles, players can help the games they love get the recognition they need to succeed.\nSome developers have curated a community on social media that helps them get the word out about their game. Even so, coverage is still very limited.\nCommunity Means A Lot To Indie Game Developers\nSocial media has been one of the biggest blessings to game developers. Screengrabs, gameplay videos, and other things help to raise awareness and get people involved with the development. Some developers create and manage a Discord server to help them get updates to their followers much faster. There are a few reasons community is such a huge thing for an indie developer.\nPlayer Feedback\nEarly access and beta testing are common practices in indie game development, allowing players to provide feedback that helps shape the final product. This interaction is essential for developers, who rely on player input to identify bugs, balance gameplay, and improve overall quality. That's why some devs release early access games on Steam to get a community interested in its development.\nFor gamers, participating in early access and providing constructive feedback is a way to directly influence the development process. It creates a sense of collaboration between developers and players, leading to games that better meet player expectations and desires. Imagine saying you had a hand in helping to develop a great game!\nCommunity Marketing\nHave you ever seen a game and then told all your friends about it? That's the kind of energy that indie devs love about their communities. Positive reviews, social media shares, and personal recommendations can significantly boost a game's visibility and success. Unlike large studios with substantial marketing budgets, indie developers depend on the organic spread of information to reach new players.\nAs a player, sharing your favorite indie games with friends and on social media can have a meaningful impact. Every mention, review, or recommendation helps build momentum and can be the difference between an indie game thriving or fading into obscurity.\nCommon Misconceptions Shadowing The Industry\nPutting together an indie game isn't an easy task. Aside from the uphill battle when it comes to discoverability, many developers also have the problem of misconceptions clouding the air around their projects.\nSome players have a preconceived notion that most indie games are of low-quality. However, games like Celeste, Hollow Knight, and Stardew Valley prove that indie titles can be just as fun to play as big-budget games. Players should approach indie games with an open mind, appreciating the unique qualities and innovations they bring to the table.\nAnother common misconception is that indie devs are making tons of money from their product. Over the years, there have been a few very successful indie titles, but most indie devs rarely make back the money they sink into a project. Many game devs have to find alternative ways of making money to stay afloat. Even if their game is successful, it won't necessarily pay for itself unless it gets massive traction.\nIt's A Lot of Effort, But We Still Do It\nIndie game developers pour passion, creativity, and immense effort into their projects. Despite facing significant challenges, their dedication results in some of the most innovative and unique gaming experiences available.\nWe spend so many hours trying to work out bugs or figuring out if a particular game mechanic is fun because we love making things for people to play. We love it when people come to us and tell us they played our game and enjoyed it. For many indies in the industry, game development isn't about the money. It's about making more things for people to enjoy and exploring a passion for creating."

      "text": "Summary\n- Metroidvania games reward progression and exploration with new abilities and upgrades to access more of the map.\n- The genre originated with Metroid and Castlevania, evolving to include indie hits like Cave Story and Axiom Verge.\n- Modern Metroidvania titles, such as Dead Cells and Ori series provide a range of takes on the genre that blend different genres and provide accessible and unique entry points to the genre.\nThe \u201cMetroidvania\u201d genre can be hard to wrap your head around if you\u2019re not familiar with the Metroid or Castlevania franchises. To further muddy the waters, the genre has a completely different name in Japan. But these games are worthy of your time considering the ways in which they reward progression and exploration.\nWhat Is a Metroidvania or Search-Action Game?\nThe term Metroidvania is a portmanteau of Metroid and Castlevania, two games that ultimately defined the genre. Nintendo\u2019s Metroid saw its first release in August 1986, while Castlevania made its debut in September of the same year.\nThe original games take the form of action-adventure platformers with large interconnected levels, an often complex world map, and a gradual upgrade system. Perhaps the most defining characteristic is the way that players gain new abilities, items, or means of accessing new parts of the map as they proceed through the game.\nFor example, when starting a Metroidvania game, you will likely encounter inaccessible doors, switches that you can\u2019t use, ledges that you can\u2019t reach, and more right from the outset. Over time, you will unlock ways to access these areas either through tools or skills, which often lead to even more upgrades that you can use to fully explore the map. This drip-feed of progressive exploration is one of the most satisfying aspects of modern gaming.\nAs a result, these games can often require a fair bit of backtracking or warping which is why a detailed map becomes such a valuable resource. Like any genre, not every game that falls within this categorization rigidly adheres to the rules. As such, the lines have become blurred as more games take inspiration from the genre or bend it into something different entirely.\nIn Japan, this type of game is known as a \u201cSearch-Action\u201d game (Tansaku-Gata Akushon). This is likely because Metroid didn\u2019t experience the same level of success there as it did in the West, and because Castlevania is known as Akumaj\u014d Dracula in Japan.\nThe Evolution of Metroid and Castlevania\nAfter Metroid and Castlevania debuted in 1986, both franchises saw success with the release of further entries. Super Metroid became an SNES hit in 1994, taking advantage of the system\u2019s increased power with improved visuals. It further encouraged exploration with secret areas, varied biomes, and a more compelling narrative.\nCastlevania: Symphony of the Night is regarded by many as the franchise\u2019s best outing, arriving on PlayStation in 1997. The game incorporated role-playing elements like a character upgrade system on top of other genre staples like an interconnected world and incremental upgrades.\nMetroid eventually made the move to the 3D realm with the arrival of the Metroid Prime series, which blends first-person shooting with more traditional Metroidvania elements. Nintendo\u2019s most recent 2D Metroid outing was 2021\u2019s Metroid: Dread for Nintendo Switch, a follow-up that received widespread praise from fans of the series and critics alike.\nKoji Igarashi, the writer and programmer of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, left Konami in 2014 and responded to fan requests for more of the same with Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. This spiritual successor to the best of the Castlevania series proved to be a hit, with additional content released as late as 2024, with a sequel in the works.\nBut there\u2019s way more to the genre than namesakes and spiritual spin-offs. Indie development studios in particular have picked up the torch and made valuable contributions, like 2004\u2019s Cave Story which was developed by a single Japanese developer (Daiksuke Amaya) in his free time, before becoming a cult classic with an accessible modern Nintendo Switch port.\nAxiom Verge is another similar Metroidvania that started as a side project by developer Thomas Happ. Like Cave Story, the game is considered an indie masterpiece by many and has gone on to receive a sequel. The game takes a lot of inspiration from Metroid, tasking the player with exploration of an alien planet through the use of power-ups and upgrades.\nThe Ori series is another fan-favorite Metroidvania platformer, with a more approachable difficulty curve and beautiful visuals. Hollow Knight is another beloved title that takes inspiration from Metroid, Zelda, and Mega Man that saw its development funded by a Kickstarter campaign. The follow-up, Hollow Knight: Silksong is one of the most eagerly awaited games of all time.\nAnd then there are the outliers, like Yoku\u2019s Island Express, which is part pinball game and part platformer, with a strong emphasis on Metroidvania elements like exploration and unlocks. Steamworld Dig (and its sequel) incorporate one of the most satisfying gameplay loops of exploration, mining, and ever-improving equipment that\u2019s so good it\u2019s hard to put down.\nBut perhaps the best example of a modern Metroidvania is Dead Cells, a game that blends the best parts of a roguelike game with the exploration and permanent unlocks of a Metroidvania. Like other roguelikes, the game is run-based, and when you die you lose all of your items and upgrades while still making progress by unlocking Runes and spending an in-game currency on consumables called Cells.\nWhere Should You Start?\nIf you\u2019ve never played a Metroidvania before, many of the games mentioned above are good starting points. Perhaps the two most obvious choices though are Super Metroid (available on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System with a Nintendo Switch Online membership) and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (available on PS4 and playable on PS5).\nSteamworld Dig 2 is worthy of your time if you\u2019re put off by the difficulty of some Metroidvania titles, and you can finish it in a few hours. Guacamelee! is another approachable title that embraces Mexican folklore and accessible combat to great effect.\nFor a step up in difficulty and a chance to be wowed by an endearing story and jaw-dropping art direction, Ori and the Blind Forest and its sequel Ori and the Will of the Wisps are challenging but fair jumping-on points. The same could be said of Hollow Knight, though the game dials up the difficulty with its bosses.\nIf you\u2019re not scared of a challenge, Metroid: Dread is a true modern 2D take on the genre. Be warned though, the use of the word \u201cdread\u201d in the title is not to be taken lightly (I never did finish the final boss). Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a similarly modern take on 2D Search-Action, albeit in a more fantastical setting rather than a sci-fi one. Another modern 2D Metroidvania is Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, which even includes an \u201ceasy\u201d difficulty setting for those who need it.\nAnd even if you are put off by the Soulslike combat and fast pace, Dead Cells is a masterpiece of game design that feels oh-so-satisfying to play, even if you are making progress at a glacial pace.\nIf you\u2019ve got a modern portable console like the Nintendo Switch or Valve\u2019s Steam Deck handheld gaming PC, these types of games are especially well-suited to handheld play. They work well in short bursts, rely on relatively simple control schemes, and many of them have system requirements that won\u2019t stress your battery too much. The older titles are also ripe for emulation, something the Steam Deck does very well."
