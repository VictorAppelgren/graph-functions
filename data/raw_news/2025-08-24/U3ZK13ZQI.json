  "content": "Disneyland says the perk is underutilized; in its place, guests will get one freebie and then have to pay for the rest.\n\nOne of the only reasons to stay in a Disney-owned hotel at one of their theme parks is for the extras.\n\nThe hotels are fine, but there's nothing so special that makes them worth the significantly extra price.\n\nIt's the perks that make it worth it.\n\nWhen my kids were little, we usually stayed at the Disneyland Hotel or the Disneyland Pixar Place (formerly the Paradise Pier) because it was easy to get the kids back to their rooms for naps on the monorail or shuttle, and because we got early park entrance.\n\nEven getting a 30-minute jump ahead of most visitors meant we could get at least one more ride on Space Mountain or the Matterhorn each day.\n\nIt was absolutely worth the extra $100 a night (or even a little more).\n\nOnce naps weren't an issue, the \"rope drop\" for early park entrance was the big draw, especially as the kids got older and wanted to ride all the rides, again and again.\n\nNow Disneyland is making a major change to one of its most recognizable hotel perks, effective Jan. 5, 2026.\n\nDisneyland getting rid of early theme park entry in 2026\n\nGuests staying at Disneyland Hotel, Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, or Pixar Place Hotel will no longer enjoy early theme park entry, which allowed them to access select attractions 30 minutes before the general public.\n\nIn its place, each guest will receive one Lightning Lane redemption per stay (yes, per stay, not per day), which can be used for popular rides like Space Mountain, Matterhorn Bobsleds, or Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: BREAKOUT!, depending on availability.\n\nAt first glance, this appears to be a simple swap of perks.\n\nBut a closer look reveals how Disney (DIS) responds to changing guest habits, operational realities, and revenue opportunities.\n\nDisney's own analysis showed that many hotel guests were not taking full advantage of early entry. Guests reported that the designated park schedule often did not align with their plans, and younger children or travelers who prefer sleeping in were unlikely to use the perk consistently.\n\nFamilies visiting both parks over several days sometimes found that early entry at one park was inconvenient or simply not relevant to their itinerary.\n\nEarly entry is also a significant cost for Disney, requiring extra staffing and resources: ride operators, security, and shops must open earlier each morning, even when only a fraction of hotel guests participate.\n\nLightning Lane, by contrast, integrates seamlessly into Disney's existing skip-the-line system. It allows the company to manage guest flow more efficiently, optimize staffing, and reinforce a system that also generates revenue through paid upgrades.\n\nFor families who never managed to use early entry effectively, this may feel like an upgrade.\n\nIt's also a way to introduce hotel guests to the Lightning Lane concept and condition them to see the add-on as a central part of the park experience.\n\nDisney is not alone in rethinking traditional perks. Theme parks are moving away from time-based advantages that require early mornings and rigid schedules, and instead offering flexible, demand-based services that better reflect modern guest behavior.\n\nThe change represents a trade-off: less frequent exclusivity, but more flexibility and potential efficiency in navigating the park.\n\nFor Disneyland, it's a calculated decision that balances guest satisfaction, operational efficiency, and revenue strategy. And revenue for The Walt Disney Company is way up.\n\nAt the company's most recent earnings call, the company reported park attendance, hotel bookings, and spending on merchandise and food were all up from the previous year.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Experiences Division by the numbers:\n\n\"We have more expansions underway around the world in our parks and experiences than at any other time in our history. With ambitious plans ahead for all our businesses, we\u2019re not done building, and we are excited for Disney\u2019s future,\u201d The Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said during the August 6 announcement.\n\nIf you want to take advantage of Disneyland's early entrance perk, the last day to do it is January 4, 2026.\n\nMake a free appointment with TheStreet\u2019s Travel Agent Partner, Postcard Travel, or email Amy Post at amypost@postcardtravelplanning.com or call or text her at 386-383-2472.",
