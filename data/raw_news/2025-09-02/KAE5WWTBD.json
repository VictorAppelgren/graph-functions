This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nWhether you\u2019re a baby ARMY or a fan from Day 1, BTS\u2019 ARMY meaning has one heck of a story. As fans know, ARMY was established as BTS\u2018 fandom name on July 9, 2013, soon after the release of the band\u2019s first single, \u201c2 Cool 4 Skool.\u201d\nThe word is an acronym for \u201cAdorable Representative M.C. For Youth,\u201d but there are also other meanings. According to USBTSARMY.com, the fandom name \u201cARMY\u201d also relates to the meaning of BTS\u2019 full name, \u201cBangtan Sonyeondan,\u201d which translates loosely to \u201cBulletproof Boyscouts\u201d in English. According to USBTSARMY.com, ARMY is the military while BTS is the armor, which is a metaphor for how the band and fans will always be together.\nBut ARMY wasn\u2019t the first choice for BTS\u2019 fandom name. In an interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in July 2021, BTS\u2019 leader, RM, revealed that their fandom was almost named \u201cThe Bells.\u201d BTS\u2019 members also include Jin, J-Hope, Suga, Jimin, V and Jungkook. \u201cWhen you say BTS, it stands for \u2018bangtan\u2019 in Korean, not \u2018behind-the scenes.\u2019 I mean, for your information,\u201d RM said. \u201cIt stands for \u2018bangtan,\u2019 and when you say \u2018bell\u2019 in Korean, it sounds like \u2018bang wool.\u2019 It starts with the same word, \u2018bang.'\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cSo when we think of the fan name, someone brings up the idea, like, \u2018What about the bell thing?\u2019 Everybody rings their bells and [we\u2019re] like, \u2018Make some noise!\u2019 and the Bells are like \u2018ring-a-ling-a-ling.\u2019 But thank God that [it changed], ARMY is so much better.\u201d\nSince BTS\u2019 debut, ARMYs have used their used their power for social and political action around the world. According to Esquire, the fandom, which includes tens of millions of people across the globe, have raised money to regrow rainforests, feed LGBTQ+ refugees and more. \u201cWe and our ARMY are always charging each other\u2019s batteries,\u201d RM told Esquire in 2020. \u201cWhen we feel exhausted, when we hear the news all over the world, the tutoring programs, and donations, and every good thing, we feel responsible for all of this.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be greater; we\u2019ve got to be better. All those behaviors always influence us to be better people, before all this music and artist stuff.\u201d\nThe word \u201cARMY\u201d was also featured in the music video for BTS\u2019 July 2021 single, \u201cPermission to Dance,\u201d which was co-written with Ed Sheeran. The track, which is from BTS\u2019 Butter single album, is the band\u2019s third full English song after 2020\u2019s \u201cDynamite\u201d and 2021\u2019s \u201cButter.\u201d \u201cDynamite\u201d was BTS\u2019 first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single and earned the band their first Grammy nomination in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category. \u201cButter\u201d is BTS\u2019 longest-running number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, with at least seven weeks at the top of the charts.\nOur mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you\u2019ll love as much as we do.
