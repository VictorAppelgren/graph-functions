  "title": "Fire Without Smoke Is (Almost) Possible. Our 4 Favorite Firepits",
  "description": "These burning rings of fire (but less smoke) will make your patio a party, and your jacket less smelly.",
  "content": "Solo Stove Yukon for $500: If you love Solo Stove but the 19-inch Bonfire 2.0 above isn't large enough for your space, consider the Solo Stove Yukon. The 27-inch Yukon is big enough for a crowd of s'mores and functions nearly identically to the smaller models. While it's still portable, the Yukon is best thought of as \u201cportable around the house\u201d unless you have a good-size vehicle to haul it to a campsite. It's not cheap, but it is generally priced $100 below the same-sized pit from Breeo. Thanks to its solid, stainless steel construction, it's essentially indestructible (as long as you cover it in winter), so this investment should last for years.\n\nCuisinart Cleanburn 24-inch Firepit for $300: While most smokeless firepits have the same tin-can shape, this Cuisinart comes in the form of a shapely bowl. It's nice. And it\u2019s lightweight and portable enough to move around, with a removable ash pan for easy cleaning. The bowl shape does make it harder to fit logs in for a fire, so either you'll do some chopping or the fire will rest higher in the bowl. It's an attractive pit with a distinctive shape that's effective at reducing smoke at a reasonable price. But it doesn't quite have the accessory options that make other pits useful for cooking and easy to port around.\n\nSnow Peak Takibi Fire & Grill for $320: Snow Peak's Takibi Fire & Grill is an extremely well-made (heavy-duty stainless steel), traditional firepit and doubles nicely as a wood-fire grill for your next DIY tiki blowout. Its genius is the folding design, which can lie flat for storage and be toted easily in a nice canvas carry bag. Heck, WIRED reviewer Adrienne So says it made her like camping trips again. It's designed to last forever, and by all accounts it does. Multiple WIRED reviewers have been testing theirs for years, and the worst wear they've seen is smoke and fire marks. But it's not smokeless unless you buy an extra \u201cFloga\u201d attachment that costs $200, which adds some height and secondary combustion.\n\nIn part, we test smokeless firepits by building fires in them, then seeing how well they fare at cooking, being pleasant, and also being smokeless. Multiple testers have tried out multiple rounds of firepits over the past few years. But for the most recent round of testing, I made fires in each pit using both firewood and lump coal, cooked over each firepit, and tested air quality continually while burning with each pit to see if particulate matter 6 feet and 20 feet from the pit fell within acceptable levels. (Twenty feet is an approximate stand-in for \u201cis your neighbor mad at you?\u201d) I cooked marshmallows and hot dogs over each pit, to see how pleasant it was to be near the putatively smokeless pit. And if firepits had grill accessories, we cooked meals on them, ranging from veggies to burgers to pork and chicken rotisserie, and even pizza. I also assessed each smokeless firepit for how easy each was to dump and clean, portability, capacity, and whether the vents clogged easily. But here's the thing: Smoke, especially black or gray smoke, is a sign of the inefficiency of a fire. Much of smoke is uncombusted material, carried aloft into the air. If you burn more efficently, you make a lot less uncombusted material and therefore less smoke. Certainly, you make smoke that's less dirty and less full of particulate matter that's both unpleasant and unhealthy to inhale. Most modern smokeless firepits achieve this with a quite similar design. The firepit is double-walled design, with a gap in between the walls and vents on the top and bottom of the pit. The base of the pit is elevated, so that oxygen can reach the flames at all times. Air gets sucked into the bottom vents and gets heated while traveling up in the space between the double walls. When it leaves the top vents, it's hot enough to reignite and burn the unexpended particles in the smoke, in a process called secondary combustion. This secondary combuston makes the fire hotter, and more efficient, and less smoky in general. What's fun is that this is a self-reinforcing cycle: If the fire burns hotter, the circuit of air through the double walls also gets hotter, and accelerates the cycle. And so the firepit will get hotter, and more efficient, and less smoky over time. Typically, as you first start the fire, you'll still get quite a bit of smoke leaving the firepit, until the fire gets hot enough to begin secondary combustion. This increased heat will also end up meaning you burn fuel faster, even as you're burning it more efficiently. Anecdotally, burn through fuel about twice as fast with an efficient smokeless pit\u2014I've also achieved coal temperatures well in excess of a thousand degrees. Needless to say, this makes a smokeless firepit kind of terrific for cooking. How Can I Use a Firepit Safely? Firepits are generally pretty simple to use, but here are a few tips and tricks to ensure safety and longevity. Follow the manufacturer's suggestions on where to put it. For example, most companies will tell you to keep it a specific distance from any structure, and not to place it on a wood deck, in a field of dry grass, or in other highly flammable situations. Following this advice seems wise Keep your firepit clean (wipe up those burnt marshmallows once it cools), regularly empty the ashes, and cover them when not in use (or take them inside if they're portable), and they should last you many years. That said, don't forget the basics. Make sure you're burning the right wood (don't burn pressure-treated wood, and avoid yard trimmings if you don't know what kind of wood it is). Keep a fire extinguisher and a water bucket handy, and make sure your children and pets stay away from the fire. Before you invest, check the legal restrictions in your area. There are often specific rules in big cities (like New York City, where one of WIRED's editors cannot have a firepit because he lives in an attached row house). Even if there aren't city laws prohibiting firepits, many homeowners associations have restrictions, so make sure of the legal situation in your neighborhood before buying a pit. Check on existing fire warnings in your region. Sometimes it's not a great time to start outdoor fires. Check on FEMA's website, which as of September 2025 offers multiple resources about fire warnings in your area.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

      "text": "In the last five years, I've tested beautiful projectors, audiophile-grade turntables, and nearly every pair of wireless headphones worth listening to for my job, and yet the product my roommates have begged me to keep is Solo Stove's new 27-inch Yukon firepit.\nIt seems absurd. You can build a pretty firepit with bricks for $20, or get an elevated, portable one for about $100 on Amazon. How can this $500 stainless steel circle be that much better? After about a month of socially distanced burning, I\u2019m almost sad to report how good it is. The gorgeous, patented design doesn\u2019t just make my lawn look like a tasteful bee sanctuary instead of a weedy mess\u2014it also burns wood better than anything I\u2019ve ever seen.\nI like oak-smoked burnt ends as much as the next guy, but outside of bimonthly excursions to Matt\u2019s BBQ (a Guy Fieri\u2013approved must-try in Portland, Oregon,) I\u2019ve never paid much attention to the type of wood I put in a fire.\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t know that various types of woods burn differently, it\u2019s just that I never needed to care. My basic teepee fires burn relatively low and slow, no matter what I use. But the first time I piled a mountain of Douglas fir (the cheapest in my neck of the woods) in the Yukon and lit it, I realized I needed much harder wood.\nThis all comes down to how hot the thing is able to get. Solo Stove\u2019s keglike circle has round holes around the bottom of the outside and the top of the inside, with an elevated section to put the wood in, allowing for excellent airflow. It\u2019s a great design that lets the pit suck air through the wood the entire time a fire is lit.\nBut that design also comes with a downside: It burns wood hotter and faster than most fires, ripping through my soft fir logs in no time. In my experience, it will reduce a medium-size log to glowing ash in about 30 minutes. Next time, I\u2019ll go with oak or another harder wood, so I won\u2019t have to pop logs in as often.\nThe design makes it super easy to light, no lighter fluid or kindling required. I usually tear up a paper bag and light it beneath my logs\u2014the airflow immediately pushes the flame toward the logs above, passively fanning the flames. Gathering logs, setting them up in my shape of choice, and lighting a blazing fire takes about five minutes."

      "text": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nI first saw Snow Peak\u2019s Pack-and-Carry Fire Pit at Snow Peak Way, the cult outdoor brand's yearly camping retreat. A few Fire Pits were set up in the field, deep in the wooded recesses of the Columbia River Gorge. Kids of all ages gathered around them, helping themselves to marshmallows, chocolate, and graham crackers, while their parents warmed their toes beside them.\nMy husband handed glow sticks to our two kids and they ran around like happy, sticky fireflies in the dimming twilight. \u201cThis is amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had this before.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018this\u2019?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been outside and just let the kids go,\u201d he said.\nCamping with kids is hard. Doing anything with kids is harder than without them, unless you want to jump in a ball pit, eat ice cream, or talk to a grandma. I have a 2-year-old son and a 4-year-old daughter. They never stop moving, usually in a direction that I do not want them to go.\nWhen we're camping, they sleuth out where I\u2019ve hidden the hatchet and swing it around, pretending to be pirates. They take every single one of our possessions out of their plastic bins and throw them in the dirt. Or else they cackle and push their faces into other people\u2019s tent walls, like they're trying to reenact a scene from Are You Afraid of the Dark.\n\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d a friend asked me once. \u201cThey\u2019re your kids.\u201d\nLike our offspring, my husband and I used to have limitless amounts of energy. A typical weekend day might have consisted of a 5-mile trail run, outdoor rock climbing, and then skateboarding to dinner. The outdoors was our playground, and we tackled it at top speed before coming home to pass out. When I planned a leisurely three-day backpacking trip in Hawaii, my husband stopped us at the trailhead at 6 am. \u201cYou know, I bet we can run this thing,\u201d he said.\nI put a water filter and a can of ravioli in my backpack, and we ran the whole trail in under five hours\u2014in 90-degree heat, with a cumulative elevation gain of 5,000 feet, and over narrow, rocky, unprotected trails that projected hundreds of feet over a rocky sea. We did it because we could. Also, if we cut the backpacking short, then we\u2019d have time to go surfing before going home.\nAll of this changed once we had kids. There are plenty of parents who take very small children on very extreme adventures, and I admire them. But I can\u2019t even get mine to hike a mile to see a waterfall, not when there are rocks to throw and sand to put in their shoes. After a few trips where my husband and I guiltily took turns climbing or paddling while the other watched two cranky toddlers alone, we started to give up.\nIt would be an overstatement to say that a $300 pack-and-carry firepit changed all of this. But it did help me recalibrate my expectations of what camping could be.\nThe trip with the Snow Peak Fire Pit was the first time I'd been camping in years without feeling like I was going to lose my mind. My family and I were outside together, enjoying an early-summer evening without stressing out over why the burner on the camp stove wasn't working, or trying to keep the toddler from wandering off and falling into a hornet nest.\nThe Fire Pit is versatile, durable, and reliable. It folds down flat for storage in your car, so it doesn't take up valuable space that you need for 6 billion different stuffed animals. Then it unfolds into an elegant metal basket\u2014no tinkering, no complicated setup. It has a grill top, so you can put your already-skewered chicken skewers over the coals while watching your 4-year-old learn how to play cornhole with a nearby group of young adults, who will all come over at different times to tell you how adorable she is.\nIt can grow and change with you, and it will last for the rest of your life. Snow Peak CEO Tohru Yamai designed it over 20 years ago and in that time has only ever received two customer complaints. You can use it to cook, as a firepit in areas where there are burn restrictions, or add oven attachments, or hook a small table on it. It looks nice, unlike my tiny, rickety backpacking stove or rusted, ancient Coleman stove. Anyone can use and enjoy it\u2014the crazy young 'un I once was, the harassed and wistful parent that I am now, and whoever I'm going to be in the future when my kids get older.\nI haven\u2019t given up on adventure quite yet. I still have my fingers crossed that one day I'll ask my kids if they want Mommy to tie them to a rope and dangle them off some high rock ledge. If they're anything like me, they'll think this is a great idea.\nBut in the meantime, I\u2019m trying to keep an open mind. My daughter, who used to think camping was alternately boring and scary, now asks when we\u2019re going to go again. Possibilities have started to open back up\u2014wide, flat gravel trails and rustic lodges, creeks with sandy beaches. Instead of dragging our kids on a summer expedition to go mountain-biking in Idaho, maybe we\u2019ll just rent a yurt near a lake. We'll light up the Fire Pit, toss a few hot dogs on the grill, and call it a day.\nIt's taken me four years to figure this out, but maybe it\u2019s an adventure just to have your kids laughing around a firepit in the dusk, surrounded by tall trees. Sometimes just getting out the door is enough. The Snow Peak Fire Pit is probably going to last long enough for my daughter to take on camping trips with her own kids. When she does, I hope they give her hell. She deserves it.\nWhen you buy something using the retail links in our stories, we may earn a small affiliate commission.
