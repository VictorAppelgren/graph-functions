  "content": "WE HAVE BEEN TEEMING NICELY WITH CHINA, THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS TARIFFS THEY ARE PAYING TO THE U.S. AND THE RELATIONSHIP IS GOOD WITH XI JINPING AND MYSELF. HASLINDA: TRUMP SAYING HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH XI JINPING AS HE EXPANDS THE TARIFF PAUSE FOR ANOTHER 90 DAYS, WILL THIS STABILIZE TIES? LIVE FROM SINGAPORE THIS IS INSIGHT WITH HASLINDA WHERE WE DIVE DEEPER WITH CRUCIAL CONTEXT AND SHARP ANALYSIS. TRUMP IS OPEN TO A DEAL WHERE NVIDIA WOULD SELL A SCALED-BACK BLACKWELL CHIP AND WE SPEAK TO CLAIRE READE OF CHINA ENFORCEMENT. THE TARIFFS TRUCE OFFERS RELIEF. WE WILL GET INSIGHTS ON THE UNCERTAIN RATE POTH -- PATH. THE CEO OF BBO UNIBANK WILL BE JOINING US EXCLUSIVELY. \u266a HASLINDA: MORE ON OUR TOP STORY, TRUMP EXPANDING THE CHINA TARIFF TRUCE FOR ANOTHER 90 DAYS, AVERTING TARIFFS THIS WEEK. MINMIN LOW, THE TARIFFS TRUCE WAS WELL ANTICIPATED? MINMIN: NOT A WHOLE LOT OF REACTION AND ONSHORE IS PERFORMING BETTER THAN OFFSHORE, KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD, BUYING BOTH SIDES TIME. WE ARE LOOKING AHEAD TO A SUMMIT WITH XI AND TWUMP -- TRUMP AND THEY MAY ANNOUNCE A BIGGER OUTCOME FROM TRADE TALKS. TRUMP WANTS CHINA TO QUADRUPLE SOY BEAN PURCHASES. THE THREATS LEVELED ON CHINA OVER RUSSIAN OIL HAVE NOT BEEN ACTED ON YET. CHINA WANTS THE FENTANYL TAX REMOVED AND HIGH-END CHIPS AS WELL. HASLINDA: TRUMP IS ROLLING BACK CURBS ON NVIDIA? MINMIN: THAT WAS A TOP NATIONAL SECURITY RED LINE FOR THE U.S. AND TRUMP IS WILLING TO ROLL THAT BACK FOR A CONCESSION FROM NVIDIA OF A 15% CUT OF THEIR CHIP REVENUE. THEY CAN ONLY ACCESS OLDER CHIPS AND BLACKWELL IS MORE ADVANCED. TRUMP: BLACKWELL IS SUPER, DUPER ADVANCED, I WOULD NOT MAKE A DEAL ON THAT. UNLESS IT WAS ENHANCED IN A NEGATIVE WAY. MINMIN: THERE IS LEGAL UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE THE REVENUE FOR THE EXCHANGE COULD BE A FORM OF EXPORT TAX, WHICH IS NOT CONSTITUTIONAL AND COULD FACE LEGAL CHALLENGES IN THE FUTURE. CHINA SEES A SECURITY RISK IN THESE CHIPS WITH THE U.S. HAVING A BACKDOOR TO CHINA. THE BLACKWELL LINE OF CHIPS MAY CONVINCE THEM TO TAKE THAT RISK. HASLINDA: MIN, THANK YOU FOR THAT. WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM GUESTS ON THE U.S. AND CHINA INCLUDING WENDY CUTLER AND JOHN GONG, LET'S LISTEN: NOW THEY CAN PUT THEIR ENERGY ON ISSUES LIKE EXPORT CONTROLS, MINERALS, EXCESS CAPACITY. I THINK THIS WILL BE THE NEW NORMAL AND TRUMP WILL CONTINUE EXTENDING THIS DEADLINE FOR THREE MONTHS AS A BARGAINING CHIP. HASLINDA: LET'S BRING IN CLAIRE READE, THE ASSISTANT TRADE ENFORCER. WITH CHIPS, PAYING FOR LICENSES, IS THAT LEGAL? CLAIRE: WELL... UH, IT CERTAINLY IS CONTROVERSIAL AND THE CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS EXPORT TAX, SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS DUBIOUS IN TERMS OF ITS LEGALITY AND WE SHALL SEE. HASLINDA: IS IT A MISUSE OF EXPORT CONTROLS? CLAIRE: WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S A FUNNY SIDE DEAL, IF YOU WILL, THAT IS NOW ATTACHED TO THE EXPORT CONTROL PROGRAM AND WOULD BE SHOCKING TO THE EXPERTS WHO WORKED ON CONTROLS AND SECURITY IN THE U.S. AND GLOBALLY FOR DECADES. HASLINDA: WOULD YOU SAY THERE IS INDEED A CONTRADICTION. THIS IS AN AVENUE -- A WAY TO ADD TO THE COFFERS? CLAIRE: TRUMP WANTED A CUT AND HIS BUSINESSMAN INSTINCTS KICKED IN, THAT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME. HASLINDA: MMM. I'M WONDERING IF IT IS UNPRECEDENTED. WHEN NIPPON STEEL TOOK OVER U.S. STEEL WITH THE GOVERNMENT GETTING A CUT, WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE IT AGAIN. THAT WAS A DIFFERENT FORM OF INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND WAS UNUSUAL FOR THE GOVERNMENT, BUT THIS IS EVEN FARTHER AFIELD FROM WHAT ONE WOULD CONSIDER TO BE A RULE OF LAW BASED SET OF ACTIVITIES. IT MAKES YOU WORRY SECURITY COULD BE COMPROMISED. IF YOU ASSUME TRUMP'S ADVISORS WANT TO PROTECT U.S. SECURITY, THEN THIS MAY BE AN ABBERATION --ABERRATION BUT THE CHIPS ARE NOT THREATENING NATIONAL SECURITY IN WHATEVER FORM IT IS THEY ARE ALLOWED TO BE SOLD. HASLINDA: IT'S ALSO ABOUT MESSAGING, ARE YOU CAN SOUND -- CONCERNED ABOUT THE MESSAGE TRUMP IS SENDING TWO COMPANIES THAT THERE IS A PRICE FOR EVERYTHING, EVEN NATIONAL SECURITY? CLAIRE: WELL, I BELIEVE THERE ARE BOTH, UM, REAL NATIONAL SECURITY PRIORITIES FOR TRUMP AND ADVISORS WHO KEEP HIS POLICIES FROM FALLING OFF THE CLIFF. IT DOESN'T MEAN HE WILL NOT PUSH BOUNDARIES, WE HAVE SEEN THAT ALREADY, SO HE IS PROBING IN EXPORT CONTROLS AND THERE WILL BE MORE CONSTRAINTS ON HIM IN THAT AREA BECAUSE IF HE MAKES A MISTAKE OF GIVING AWAY THE STORE TO A COMPETITOR, THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY. HASLINDA: MMM. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TRUMP UPENDING TRADE, BUT THIS IS A NEW AND DANGEROUS POTH -- PATH NOW, WHAT ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN? SINCE APRIL? OR THE EXPORT CONTROLS? HASLINDA: THE EXPORT CONTROLS. CLAIRE: AH, YES. DIPPING YOUR TOES INTO THAT WATER IS DANGEROUS IF IT JEOPARDIZES NATIONAL SECURITY AND PAY TO PLAY WILL SEEM TO MANY THAT THERE ARE AREAS THAT SHOULD BE CABINED OFF FROM A BUSINESS TRANSACTION. HASLINDA: MMM. UH, YOU'VE BEEN PRIVY TO TRADE NEGOTIATIONS AND I WONDER IF CHINA IS WINNING AT THIS STAGE? WELL, I THINK IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY BECAUSE WE ARE NOT FULLY AWARE OF WHAT IS GOING ON BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, BUT THE BESSENT COMMENT EARLY ON THAT BESSENT BELIEVED CHINA HAD A POOR HAND IN THE POKER GAME, THAT WAS MISTAKEN AND IT IS CLEAR CHINA IS ACTING STRATEGICALLY WITH A GOOD HAND TO PLAY. SO I WOULD SAY IT IS MOST ACCURATE TO SAY THE U.S. DOESN'T HAVE THE UPPER HAND, IT IS CLOSER TO TWO EQUALS HERE, EACH WITH DIFFERENT LEVERAGE -- HASLINDA: -- NOT TO MENTION CHINA'S RED LINES. ARE YOU HOPEFUL WE COULD SEE A TRADE AGREEMENT? CLAIRE: WELL, I FEEL THE DIRECTIONS OF BOTH COUNTRIES ARE NOT HEADING TOWARD COLLABORATION. FOR EACH, IT IS IN THEIR SELF-INTEREST NOT TO BLOW UP THE RELATIONS IN TERMS OF ECONOMICS AND TRADE, BUT THAT WILL BE THE BASIS OF ANY DEAL AND THESE ARE NOT FRIENDS. THESE ARE TWO COUNTRIES TRYING TO COME OUT ON TOP, EACH OF THEM, AND I THINK CHINA DOESN'T BELIEVE THERE IS A WIN-WIN. THEY WOULD LIKE TO WIN ALONE. A ZERO SUM GAME AND THERE ARE CHINA HAWKS IN THE U.S. WHO FEEL STRONGLY, BUT TRUMP HAS A SENSE THAT THERE IS A DEAL TO BE MADE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW COMPREHENSIVE ANY DEAL COULD BE. I'M INCLINED TO THINK IT WILL MEET TRUMP'S SHORT TERM NEEDS, LIKE FENTANYL, THE FARM TRADE, GETTING CRITICAL MINERALS TO FLOW IN A STABLE WAY AND THAT THE QUESTION WILL BE WHAT DOES CHINA WANT AND WHAT WILL THE U.S. GIVE? HASLINDA: IS THIS, UH, THE NEW NORMAL FOR THE U.S. AND CHINA TRADE RELATIONS? A GUEST SAID THESE SHORT TRUCES CAN BE EXPECTED FROM HERE ON. I THINK WE ARE CRYSTAL BALL GAZING AND MANY FACTORS DETERMINE THE RELATIONS. GIVEN THE DIFFERENCES IN OBJECTIVES AND THE COMPETITION, YOU CAN'T -- WELL, YOU CAN, BUT IT IS MOST LIKELY YOU WOULD LOOK AT INCREMENTAL DEALS, THAT MAY HAVE BEEN SHORT TERM. I THINK THAT -- HASLINDA: -- THERE'S SO MANY ISSUES -- GO AHEAD. WHAT'S KEY HERE? CLAIRE: CHINA ARE LOOKING TO KEEP AS CALM AS POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP THEIR ECONOMY AND DOMINATE IMPORTANT GROWTH AREAS, SO THEY CAN BE NUMBER ONE. THEY RESENT DEPENDENCE ON OTHER COUNTRIES AND HAVING TO PAY LICENSING FEES AND COSTS TO BENEFIT FROM TECH, SO THEY WANT THEIR OWN TECH TO NOT DEPEND ON OTHER COUNTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE THEIR OWN CHIPS. THEY DON'T LIKE THE PRESSURE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, SO THEY WOULD LIKE TO TURN THE TABLES AND EXERT THIS LEVERAGE TO BENEFIT. THE U.S. PERSPECTIVE, AGAIN, I THINK THERE IS A MIXTURE OF VIEWS AMONGST TRUMP'S ADVISORS, SOME OF WHOM VIEW CHINA AS DANGEROUS, WHERE OTHERS MAY BE OPEN TO RELATIONS THAT DON'T HARM SECURITY. AND TRUMP, I BELIEVE, HAS FAITH IN HIS DEAL MAKING ABILITIES AND HE THINKS A DEAL CAN BE MADE THAT IS A WIN FOR HIM. AGAIN -- HASLINDA: MMM. CLAIRE: GIVEN THE NARROW AREA S S WHERE THEY CAN AGREE, IT IS NARROW. HASLINDA: RIGHT. MM. TRUMP HAS SHOWN HE APPROACHES A LOT OF THE THINGS AS TRANSACTIONS SO COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA AND CANADA, SHOULD THEY REMAIN OPTIMISTIC? CLAIRE: THEY SHOULD WORK TO BE CREATIVE TO FIND WAYS TO ENGAGE TRUMP IN A WAY THAT MAKES HIM FEEL -- SYMPATHETIC MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT WORD, BUT AMENABLE TO A CHANGE IN THAT STATUS. FOR CANADA, 30 5% TARIFFS DO NOT AFFECT GOODS FLOWING THROUGH THE FREE TRADE AGREEMENT. IT'S NOT AS DIRE AS THE SITUATION FOR INDIA. IT'S DIFFICULT FOR INDIA. HASLINDA: RIGHT. CLARIDA, SENIOR COUNSEL AND FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE FOR CHINA. STILL AHEAD, WE SPEAK TO CEO NESTOR TONG ABOUT SENTIMENT IN THE PHILIPPINES. KEEP IT HERE WITH US, THIS IS WELCOME BACK TO INSIGHT. MSCI IN POSITIVE TERRITORY, FLAT FOR THE HANG SENG WITH TECH IN ASIA GETTING A LIFT WHEN TRUMP ALLOWED COMPANIES TO SEND CHIPS TO CHINA. THE MOVE EASED MARKET CONCERNS OF SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS. U.S. FUTURES SLIGHTLY POSITIVE. COUNTING DOWN TO THE CPI PRINT FOR THE FED'S MOVES FROM HERE. STILL TO COME, THE PHILIPPINES WELCOME BACK, YOU'RE WATCHING INSIGHT. SINGAPORE RAISED ITS GROWTH FORECAST AND SEES GDP GROWING 2.5% YEAR ON YEAR, BUT THE OUTLOOK FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR IS NOT CERTAIN. THE 19% TARIFFS CAUSE UNCERTAINTY FOR BDO UNIBANK. ITS CHIEF WARNED TO EXPECT THE WORST AND JOINING US IS NESTOR TONG, CEO. DO YOU EXPECT THE WORST? NESTOR: THERE IS MORE CLARITY NOW. I USE THE SAYING THAT WE CAN LIVE WITH IT. THE PHILLIPINES EXPORTS IS ONLY ABOUT 2% TO THE U.S. THERE MAY BE A SLOWDOWN. HASLINDA: PEOPLE LOOK AT 19% AND MAY HOLD OFF INVESTED IN THAT WILL PLAY OUT IN THE ECONOMY. THAT'S TRUE BUT MOST LOOK AT STABILITY SO IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT LEVEL AND PROJECTIONS ARE OF WHAT THE INCOME WILL BE AS LONG AS THERE IS STABILITY YOU CAN PLAN AHEAD. HASLINDA: WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM THE CUSTOMERS? THERE WAITING FOR STABILITY, STABILITY IN INTEREST RATES. STABILITY IN THE GEOPOLITICAL SCENE, COMMODITY PRICES AND AS WE SEE THOSE, INVESTMENTS WILL COME IN. THE PHILIPPINES IS SUPPLY DRIVEN AND THERE IS DEMAND. IF SUPPLY IS PROVIDED, THERE WI LL BE TAKE-UP, SO IT'S GOOD FOR INVESTORS. HASLINDA: THERE IS NOW GREATER CLARITY, IN YOUR CALCULATIONS, HOW WILL TARIFFS PLAY OUT AND CAN YOU PUT A NUMBER TO IT? TO OUR BUSINESS, PROBABLY NOT MUCH. NOT MUCH, THE IMPACT WILL BE SECONDARY, MEANING EXPORTERS THAT GO THROUGH ANOTHER COUNTRY TO THE U.S., THERE MAY BE A SLOWDOWN. HASLINDA: WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU RE-THINK YOUR PROJECTIONS? GEOPOLITICAL RISK. HASLINDA: WHICH WE ARE SEEING NOW. WE ARE GETTING USED TO IT AND PLAN ON IT. HASLINDA: MM. THE PHILIPPINES, APART FROM THE TARIFFS, TRUMP PROPOSED A 3% TARIFF TAX RATE ON MONEY SENT BACK HOME, WHAT ARE THE RISKS? THAT IS NOT A BIG PART OF THE OVERALL AMOUNT, THE BULK COMES FROM THE MIDDLE EAST AND EUROPE, SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO GROW BECAUSE THE WORKERS ADD VALUE IN HEALTHCARE AND TECH. SO WHILE THE U.S. MAY IMPACT US, WE WILL REMAIN STABLE. HASLINDA: YOU CAN MAINTAIN, YOU KNOW, RECORD EARNINGS? I THINK SO. [HASLINDA LAUGHS] IT IS STRONG AT 13% AND BROADBASED. SERVICES IS DOING WELL ACROSS THE BOARD. THE PICKUP IN CLIENTS WILL CONTINUE AND ASSET QUALITY IS STABLE AND WILL REMAIN FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE. WE ARE EXPANDING OUR BRANCH NETWORK. 3% MINIMUM IMPACT ON OPERATING. WE INVEST IN TECH, SO THEY CAN DAMPEN THE BOTTOM LINE, BUT WE ARE BULLISH ON GROWTH. HASLINDA: WHAT IS VIABLE GROWTH? TOP-LINE? LOW DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH. HASLINDA: HOW WOULD YOU EXCEED YOUR EXPECTATIONS? TWO THINS. ONE IS STABILITY AND WE ARE SEEING THAT. SECOND IS A BENIGN INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. RATES WILL BE LOWERED TWICE AND WE HAVE A STRONG CURRENCY. HASLINDA: TWO RATE CUTS THIS YEAH -- YEAR. DO YOU SEE THE FIRST IN AUGUST? VERY SOON, WE DO. HASLINDA: THE NEXT ONE? BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. IT IMPACTS OUR MARGIN NEGATIVELY BECAUSE THE YIELDS GO DOWN, BUT WITH LOWER RATES, LENDING VOLUME WILL OFFSET THE MARGIN COMPRESSION. FINANCIAL INCLUSION IS IMPORTANT, HOW ARE YOU LOOKING AT DEPLOYING AI? OKAY, AI WILL MAKE AN AVERAGE EMPLOYEE LOOK SUPER. IT WILL MAKE THEM A SUPERSTAR BECAUSE NVIDIA -- OF THE PRODUCTIVITY. WE HAVE FIVE APPLICATIONS WITH TWO IN THE PIPELINE, BUT WE ARE TREADING CAREFULLY AND NOT APPLYING IT IF IT FAILS THE COST-BENEFIT TEST. WE NEED TO LIMIT OR CONTROL THE DATA OUR AI USES TO MAKE SURE THESE ARE RELIABLE. AND THIRD IS SECURITY. WE PUT GUARDRAILS AROUND THE DATA BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T BE HELPFUL IF WE DON'T PROTECT IT. IT WILL PICK UP IN ACTIVITY. HASLINDA: WHAT INVESTMENTS -- PUT A NUMBER TO IT, FOR YOUR AI? IT IS HARD. FIRST, WE RATIONALIZED DATA, THEN PUT APPLICATIONS ON TOP OF IT WHICH IS EASY, AND THIRD IS THE ROLLOUT, SO I CANNOT PUT A NUMBER TO IT -- IT'S A BIG NUMBER. HASLINDA: WITH AI MAKING WORKERS SUPERSTARS, DO YOU SEE FEWER WORKERS? PER CAPITA, FEWER, BUT WE ARE EPXANDIN -- EXPANDING AND EXPECT A PICKUP ON OUR HEAD COUNT. HASLINDA: 20% FEWER? OH, NO. FRONTLINE FUNCTIONS, MAYBE 15-20%. IT, 15-25%, BUT WE ARE JUST IN THE BEGINING PHASES AND THE NUMBERS I'M CITING ARE NOT BROADBASED. HASLINDA: YOU TAPPED THE BOND MARKET AS 2.5 BILLION USD, WHAT IS THE THINKING BEHIND THAT? IT IS PART OF OUR FUNDING MIX AND WE TRY TO KEEP LIABILITY SHORT AND NOT LONG INTEREST. IT IS PART OF OUR ARNSENAL -- ARSENAL. MOSTLY, SUSTAINABLE PROJECTS, MOSTLY GREEN AND BLUE PROJECTS. HASLINDA: HOW BIG AND WHAT IS THE AMBITION OR GOAL? TRICKLE DOWN? THE GOAL IS TO HAVE AS MANY AS WE CAN, BUT WE WAIT FOR A BORROWER -- WE ENCOURAGE GREEN METHODOLOGIES SO WE CAN LEND TO THEM. HASLINDA: ANY PALNS TO -- PLANS TO TAP THE MARKET? 2026 IS POSSIBLE. HASLINDA: ANY ACQUISITIONS? NO. WHY NOT? WE HAVE A LOT OF GROWTH AND ALL THE TOOLS WE NEED RIGHT NOW. HASLINDA: GEOPOLITICS IS A KEY UNCERTAINTY, ESPECIALLY BETWEEN THE PHILIPPINES AND, UH, CHINA? THAT IS TOUGH BECAUSE WE ARE CAUGHT BETWEEN OUR SECURITY PARTNER AND TRADING PARTNER. HASLINDA: NESTOR, DO COME BACK. THAT WAS THE CEO AND PRESIDENT OF BDO UNIBANK. TWO CHINESE SHIPS COLLIDE IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA AND THE PHILIPPINES COAST GUARD RELEASED PHOTOS AND VIDEOS. THE CHINESE SHIP SUFFERED DAMAGE. INDONESIA HAS 20 NEW REGIONAL COMMANDS ACROSS THE ARMY, NAVY AND AIR FORCE. THE OVERHAUL COMES AMID RAMPED UP DEFENSE SPENDING. INDIAN STOCKS TRADE IN ABOUT 2 MINUTES -- IT IS LOOKING PRETTY NEGATIVE. COMING UP, THE BRIGHT SPOT IN THE NES EQUITY MARKET. KEEP IT HERE WITH US, THIS IS LET'S CHECK ON THE INDIAN MARKETS AFTER THEY KICKED OFF THE SESSION TODAY. THE NIFTY IS DOWN AFTER A FOUR MONTH RALLY FRETTING ABOUT TRUMP TARIFF POLICIES AND REMEMBER GLOBAL FUNDS WITH TRUE $3 BILLION. PROMPTING SOME TO ARGUE CORPORATE EARNINGS MAY BE APPROACHING A TURNING POINT. LET'S BRING IN OUR REPORTER FROM MUMBAI. EARNINGS IS MIXED WITH INVESTORS FOCUSING ON DOMESTIC DEMAND, HOW HAVE CONSUMPTION LINKED COMPANIES BEEN SO FAR? GUEST: GOOD MORNING. THE CONSUMPTION HAS DONE WELL THIS QUARTER. CONSUMER GOODS EARNINGS HAVE BEEN IN LINE AND THE OUTLOOK HAS BEEN GHOULISH, REPORTING GOOD VOLUME GROWTH -- VOLUME GROWTH. THEY ALSO POSTED A STRONG NUMBER SO EARNINGS ARE GOOD THIS POINT IN SOME POCKETS HELPING THESE COMPANIES. HASLINDA: MM-HMM, SPEAKING OF DEMAND DO WE SEE ANY DEMAND COMING FROM INDIA'S URBAN AREAS? GUEST: OH, YES. HAS BEEN DOING BETTER AND DEMAND HAS BEEN STRONG IN LAST FEW QUARTERS, THIS IS THE REASON COMPANIES THAT ARE MORE INCLINED TOWARD REVENUE HOLDERS HAVE BEEN DOING WELL. ANALYSTS ARE HOPEFUL THAT INDIA'S RATE CUTS AND OUTLOOK, BOTH PARTS OF THE ECONOMY WILL START FIRING PROMPTING HOPEFULLY A REBOUND WITH THE NIFTY EARNINGS TO RISE 8% COMPARED WITH 1% GROWTH FOR THE PREVIOUS TIME. HASLINDA: DOMESTIC AND INVESTORS HAVE KEPT IN LOCAL STOCKS, WHAT HAS BEEN THEIR REACTION TO INDIAN EARNINGS? GUEST: DOMESTIC. INVESTORS AT A TIME WHEN MARKETS REPORTED DATA FOR MONTH OF JULY. 3%, THE DURING THE SAME MONTH MUTUAL FUNDS FOR EXPECTED 5 BILLION WORTH OF THAT FLOWS FROM INVESTORS THAT CONTRAST WITH FOREIGN INVESTORS WHO IN FACT RECOVERED ALMOST 3 BILLION, THE SAME ONE. HASLINDA: UH, AS YOU SHARED FOREIGN INVESTORS HAVE WITHDRAWN $3 BILLION. IT YOU WONDER WHAT WOULD MAKE THEM RETURNED OR MIGHT THEY STAY AWAY EVEN LONGER? OBVIOUSLY UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO TARIFFS IS ONE REASON FOR THE FOREIGN SELLOFF.. THESE ARE THE FACTORS STOPPING FLOWS FROM FOREIGNERS WITH EXPECTATION OF EARNINGS GROWTH PRESUMPTION, FOREIGN FUNDS WILL RETURN TO INDIA. HASLINDA: THANK YOU, NOW TO MORE CORPORATE STORIES, MICRON RAISED FOURTH QUARTER CITING STRONGER DRAM PRICES AND HIGH-BANDWIDTH MEMORY DEMAND. EARNINGS ARE AS HIGH AS $2.90 -- $.92 A SHARE AND SHARE IS CLOSED MORE THAN 4% HIGHER. MICRON IS ONE OF THE BEST-PERFORMING SHIP STOCKS THIS YEAR. FORD UNVEILS A PLAN FOR BUDGET ELECTRIC VEHICLES STARTING WITH A $30,000 PICKUP TRUCK. JIM FARLEY CALLS IT A BET TO TAKE ON CHINESE RIVALS WARNING THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES IN THE U.S. EV MARKET BUT THE PLAN INCLUDES A 2 BILLION-DOLLAR OVERHAUL OF THE LOUISVILLE PLANT. PARAMOUNT BOUGHT THE RIGHTS TO THE UFC IN A SEVEN-YEAR DEAL WITH $7.7 BILLION BOLSTERING PARAMOUNT PLUS STREAMING SERVICE. THE UFC OWNER TKO GROUP JUMPED IN NEW YORK TRADING AND PARAMOUNT WILL BUY INTERNATIONAL RIGHTS IN THE FUTURE POSSIBLY AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE. PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED ON SOCIAL MEDIA NO TARIFF ON U.S. GOLD IMPORTS AFTER RESET SWINGS IN PRICES. GOLD STATUS AS A SCARCE FINANCIAL ASSET SETS IT APART FROM COMMODITIES SUCH AS COPPER. GOLD WILL NOT FACE TARIFFS TRUMP SAYS. 35.15 AFTER THE DROP. TAKING A LOOK AT BITCOIN, A 100 PERCENT SEARCH MAKES IT TOO HARD TO IGNORE AND SEVEN OUT OF 10 FIRMS HAVE INVESTED IN BITCOIN. BITCOIN IS FLAT. ETHER IS UP BY ABOUT 1% AND WE KNOW RECENT LEGISLATION HAS CREATED A FAVORABLE LANDSCAPE TO HELP CRYPTO GAIN A GREATER FOOTHOLD. AND OF COURSE WE ARE KEEPING A TRACK ON THE RBA UPON DECISION. IT IS EXPECTED TO CUT 25 BASIS POINTS, THE THIRD RATE CUT OF THE YEAR AND THEY WILL CONTINUE A CAUTIOUS EASING CYCLE. S & P IS FLAT RIGHT NOW. THAT IS IT FOR INSIGHT, STAY",

  "summary": "The article discusses the relationship between the U.S. and China, where China has been paying significant tarIFFS they pay to the U., and where President Trump is open to a deal where NVIDIA would sell a SCALED-BACK BLACKWELL CHIP for a 15% reduction of their CHIP REVENUE. The article also discusses the potential impact of the TARIFF PAUSE for 90 days, which could potentially undermine ties with China. The author also discusses how China is seeking to remove the FENTANYL TAX REMOVED and high-end CHIPS from its high-profile FENTanyL TAax and wants to quadruple SOY BEAN PURCHASES. The pair also discuss the potential for a bigger outreach from trade talks due to the increased threat of RUSSIAN OIL from China.",
