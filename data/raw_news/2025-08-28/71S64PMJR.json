  "description": "The 40-year-old rapper and 31-year-old princess got engaged this past June.",
  "content": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s ex French Montana has confirmed that he will be tying the knot with Dubai Princess Sheikha Mahra Mohammed Rashed Al Maktoum.\n\nThe 40-year-old rapper and 31-year-old princess got engaged this past June, a publicist for the rap artist confirmed to TMZ on Wednesday.\n\nThe couple decided to take the plunge after Montana made his debut appearance as a model at Paris Fashion Week for 3.Paradis' Ready to Wear Spring/Summer 2026 show.\n\nThe couple have been seen at venues such as the Pont des Arts in Paris; eateries in Dubai and Morocco and on 'desert escapades by camelback,' sources told the outlet.\n\nBoth sides of their families are excited' for the wedding, the date is still under review, the outlet reported.\n\nThe Unforgettable rapper, whose real name is Karim Kharbouch, was initially linked to the princess in October 2024 - around a full decade after his romance with the youngest of the Kardashian sisters.\n\nLast fall, the Casablanca, Morocco-born musical artist and royal beauty had been seen together in a clip in which she was seen leading him on a tour of her native Dubai.\n\nThe No Stylist performer and princess were witnessed holding hands as they stepped out earlier this summer during Paris Fashion Week.\n\nPrincess Sheikha Mahra revealed she was breaking up with her estranged spouse, Sheikh Mana bin Mohammed bin Rashid bin Mana Al Maktoum, more than a year ago.\n\nThe princess said in a July 2024 post on Instagram: 'Dear Husband. As you are occupied with other companions, I hereby declare our divorce.\n\nThe post, which has since been deleted, continued: 'I divorce you, I divorce you, I Divorce You.'\n\nThe pair are parents to a one-year-old daughter, whose name they have not announced to the public yet.\n\nThe Another One of Me artist said in a 2016 segment for Elle that he found relationships with women who were involved in divorces to be 'real emotional' and 'a sensitive space for them.'\n\nMontana added, 'It's real s***. But sometimes you have to sacrifice for what you want.'\n\nMontana, who recently released the single Pack U Up with Cash Cobain, dated Khlo\u00e9 in 2014. He was linked to Pretty Girls artist Iggy Azalea in 2016.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 is finishing her summer with an eye on self-care, as she took to Instagram to open up about a 'Muse' stem cell treatment she received at the Eterna Health clinic during a vacation to Mexico with sister Kim and their kids.\n\n'I recently had the most INCREDIBLE experience that I had to share,' said the Los Angeles native, who has more than 301 million followers on Instagram. 'Plus no one likes a gate keeper hehe.'\n\nKhlo\u00e9 continued: 'I work out 5 days a week so having something to help with recovery, inflammation and overall wellness, is next level.\n\n'Not to mention the bonus of anti-aging (maybe my favorite perk).'\n\nKhlo\u00e9 continued, 'I\u2019m in awe of the science and so hopeful for the future. My dream is that one day treatments like this will be accessible and affordable to everyone, everywhere.\n\n'I know what a privilege this treatment is and I feel so incredibly blessed we were able to receive it and with such great care.'\n\nThe reality star and mom-of-two thanked staffers 'for taking such amazing care of me and my sister' Kim, adding that she's fallen in love with stem cells and will be 'coming back soooooooon.'\n\nKhlo\u00e9 - who is mother to daughter True, seven, and son Tatum, three, with her ex-boyfriend, NBA journeyman Tristan Thompson, 34 - said 'the bonus of anti-aging' was also a key selling point to undergoing the treatment.",

      "text": "Khloe Kardashian has scary looking medical treatment in Mexico that is BANNED in the US\n- Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com\nKhloe Kardashian has let fans know she had a treatment done in Mexico that is not offered in the United States.\nThe 41-year-old reality TV siren posted about the experience on Instagram on Wednesday while sharing plenty of photos.\nThere were also images of a tube going in her arm as she held up bottles of medicine in a bag.\nThe Good American designer receiving a Muse stem cell treatment, which, according to Eterna Health, achieves 'complete cellular renewal' by 'replacing compromised cells with fully functional tissue' in areas such as the joints or muscles.\nKhloe was wearing black as she posed inside a clinic with Dr Akhan.\n'I recently had the most INCREDIBLE experience that I had to share. Plus no one likes a gate keeper hehe,' wrote the ex of Tristan Thompson in her Instagram caption.\nKhloe Kardashian has let fans know she had a treatment done in Mexico that is not offered in the United States. The reality TV siren posted about the experience on Instagram on Wednesday while sharing plenty of photos. There were also images of a tube going in her arm\nIt looked like her hand was getting a procedure done, left, as she shared a photo of Cord Blood Plasma, right\n'I received a muse stem cell treatment from Dr. Akhan (sweetest/smartest guy). I work out 5 days a week so having something to help with recovery, inflammation and overall wellness, is next level. Not to mention the bonus of anti-aging (maybe my favorite perk)\n'I\u2019m in awe of the science and so hopeful for the future.'\nThe Keeping Up With The Kardashians vet also said that her dream is that one day treatments like this will be accessible and affordable to everyone, everywhere.\n'Thank you @dr.akhan @eterna.health @unlimited.bio for taking such amazing care of me and my sister at your clinic in Mexico,' added the pinup.\n'I know what a privilege this treatment is and I feel so incredibly blessed we were able to receive it and with such great care. Coming back soooooooon. I have fallen in love with stem cells.'\nWhile the treatment Khloe received isn't offered back home, stem cell treatments are not entirely banned in the US.\nCertain stem cell therapies, specifically those using blood-forming stem cells from umbilical cord blood for blood disorders, are FDA-approved and legal.\nThere were also tubed of Regen Ultra 20 over a Ziplock bag\nKhloe sat next to her doctor, whom she raved about\nHere the mother of two had her eye protectors on\nHowever, most other stem cell therapies are still considered experimental and are not yet approved for general use.\nKim also got the treatment alongside Khloe. She explained in early August what she went through.\n'Two years ago, I tore my shoulder while lifting weights, leaving me in debilitating pain. I tried everything to find relief, then I learned about the potential of stem cell therapy and met Dr. Adeel Khan at Eterna.\n'His team treated my shoulder with Dezawa Muse cells, and the results were immediate. I regained full range of motion, and my shoulder has felt completely normal ever since.'\nKardashian appeared to be hooked up to some kind of IV\nKhloe's older sister Kim, far left, also had a procedure done\nAnd she has gone back for more work but this time on her back.\n'Encouraged by this success, I recently returned to Dr. Khan to address chronic back pain that I have been suffering with for years,' said the SKIMS founder.\n'The Muse stem cell treatment was a game-changer once again. I experienced relief right away, and the unbearable pain is finally gone.'\nShe then told followers that if they are struggling with back pain, she can't recommend this treatment enough.\nKim explained that the procedure has 'transformed my life when I thought my body was breaking down.'\nIn early August, Khloe's older sister Kim shared what she did in the same clinic\nTurns out she was getting Muse stem cell treatment and there was also an image of her getting the procedure done as blood could be seen on her back. 'I'm so excited to share with you guys my stem cell journey,' began the ex-wife of Kanye West\nKim shared a closeup of what her operating room looked like. The procedure isn't currently offered in the US, but other stem cell therapies are FDA-approved and legal\nThe TV star made sure to promote Eterna, but she added a disclaimer: 'Everyone is different, and I'm just sharing what has worked for me lately. Definitely do your own homework and talk to medical professionals'\nBut Kardashian also carefully added a disclaimer: 'Everyone is different, and I'm just sharing what has worked for me lately. Definitely do your own homework and talk to medical professionals.'\nMuse stem cells aren't yet accessible in the US, so she was forced to travel to Mexico to be treated by Dr. Khan's team, she explained.\n'I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity and resources to pursue this healing, and I pray the science continues to evolve so more people can benefit. Forever thankful to @dr.akhan @eterna.health,' wrote the daughter of Kris Jenner.\nThe mother of four finished with this note: 'Here's to hope, healing, and the future of science.'"
