Cite FAN5RYW6T for cut logic.  \n4. **CrowdStrike link** – keep the company example but frame it as a *representative* tech‑heavy constituent: “CrowdStrike’s Q2 swing to a loss illustrates margin compression in the sector.” Cite KNWKYIQ1W.  \n5. **Base‑case scenario** – state: “3–5 % decline in spx over 3–6 mo if (i) tech earnings weaken, (ii) Fed cuts fail to offset inflation, (iii) margin compression spreads.”  \n6. **Alternative scenario** – “2–4 % rally if tech earnings stay strong and Fed holds rates.”  \n7. **Risk / invalidation list** – enumerate: (a) Fed rate hike, (b) stronger labor market stalling cuts, (c) rapid inflation easing, (d) tech earnings rebound.  \n8. **Watch signals** – list with dates: September payrolls (5 Sept), next CPI (mid‑Sept), Fed minutes (late‑Sept), Q2 tech earnings (late Oct), VIX spikes.  \n9. **Confidence rating** – quantify: “60 % probability of a decline” and explain basis (historical concentration, current macro).  \n10. **Citation density** – add inline citations after each numeric claim (e.g., “CPI 2.7 % YoY in July (FAN5RYW6T)”).  \n11. **Remove drift** – any mention of other assets (e.g., individual stocks beyond the S&P context) should be tied back to spx impact or removed.  \n\nImplementing these edits will satisfy the 1) handle mapping, 2) catalyst window, and 3) clear, quantitative, and defensible outlook required by the acceptance gate.",
