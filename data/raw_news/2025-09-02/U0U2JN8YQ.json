  "description": "My daily driver iPhone 15 Pro Max can't last a day anymore. What happened?",
  "content": "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\u2022 My iPhone is less than 18 months old.\n\u2022 It now cannot make it through a day without a recharge.\n\u2022 Nothing appears abnormal in the settings.\n\nRather than do my usual and upgrade my iPhone again last year with only about a year on the clock, I decided to try what most people end up having to do -- keep it going for a few years.\n\nApple says that the battery is designed to retain 80% of its original capacity at 1,000 recharge cycles \"under ideal conditions.\" At that point, when the battery's maximum capacity dips below the 80% mark, it is functionally at the end of its life and will need replacing.\n\nAlso: Upgrading to the iPhone 17? Nearly 70% of users plan to after launch - here's why\n\nSo, I should be good for at least a couple of years, right? Wrong.\n\nThe battery in my iPhone 15 Pro Max was manufactured in December 2023 and first used in March 2024 (it was delivered to me on March 9). At the time of writing, it's early September 2025, so the iPhone is around 17 months old.\n\nAlso: Changing these iOS 18 settings significantly improved my iPhone's battery life\n\nAccording to the data stored by the operating system, battery health is normal, maximum capacity is 89% compared to when it was new, and it has been through 501 recharge cycles -- almost exactly halfway through those 1,000 recharge cycles.\n\nOn top of that, I have taken every possible measure to care for the battery: I have permanently set the charging limit to 80% (Settings > Battery > Charging), avoided keeping the handset on charge for excessively long periods, and ensured it remains away from extreme temperatures.\n\nNow it doesn't last a day\n\nI start the day with an 80% charge because that's the charge limit I have it set at, and by late afternoon, it's hovering close to -- if not past -- the 20% zone.\n\nThis iPhone is running a beta version of iOS 26, with Adaptive Power enabled, so in theory it should manage battery consumption better. However, bugs are to be expected in beta software, so I thought that might have something to do with the issue and rolled back to the latest iOS 18 release.\n\nAlso: If these iPhone 17 Air rumors are real, my old phone is about to be retired\n\nNo. Battery life is no worse under iOS 26 than iOS 18.\n\nNow, I am quite a heavy iPhone user. It's never more than an arm's reach away, and I routinely have music, Audible, or YouTube playing in the background with the screen off (yes, I'm the guy paying for YouTube Premium). That's always been my usage pattern, so nothing has changed. I used to be able to make it to the evening. Now, early afternoon is tough.\n\nSo, what's going on?\n\nWhat I'm seeing here is a symptom of heavy usage. Not only does it use more battery during the day, but it also accelerates and intensifies battery degradation, thereby reducing the overall lifespan of the battery.\n\nAlso: The best power banks you can buy in 2025\n\nNow, it could be just me, but a quick search suggests I'm not alone.\n\nSo, what are my options if I wanted this handset to last me three years?\n\nWell, I'll tell you now, I'm absolutely convinced that this handset won't make it to the three-year mark without being a total nuisance to use. I can eke more battery life by increasing the charging limit from 80%, but that would likely accelerate battery wear.\n\nAlso: Finally, a lightweight power bank for my iPhone that can also take a beating\n\nI could also get the battery replaced. This is what I'll do. I'm planning on replacing this handset this year, but I can't pass it on in this condition.\n\nIn the interim, I'll grab one of my thin-and-light MagSafe power banks and make that part of my must-have everyday carry.",

Power outlets and USB charging ports are everywhere, from trains to coffee shops, taxis to airport lounges. But recently, I spent a few days in a country where this wasn't the case.\nMarrakesh, a Moroccan city nestled at the foothills of the Atlas Mountains, is a place like no other -- bustling, vibrant, and full of character. The main street branches off into narrow, labyrinthine side streets that are home to energetic souks (markets). Road signs, if present at all, are mostly in Arabic, and those that are bilingual feature French, which is not much help to someone who can't read Arabic and is only barely competent in French.\nAlso: The best power banks\nI've never felt more reliant on my iPhone for everything -- from navigating to and from my riad, where I was staying, to translating menus and leaflets -- and it was one of those places where I'd have been in trouble, big trouble, if my battery had died mid-adventure.\nThis is where I chose to test a new power bank, the Sharge CarbonMag 5K.\nSharge CarbonMag 5K tech specs\n| Specification | Details |\n|---|---|\n| Ports | 1x USB-C |\n| Battery Capacity (Rated) | 5,000mAh @3.85V / 19.25Wh |\n| Rated Capacity | 3,000mAh (5V\u23932A) |\n| Input (USB-C) | 5V\u23933A / 9V\u23932.2A / 12V\u23931.67A |\n| Output (USB-C) | 5V\u23933A / 9V\u23932.2A / 12V\u23931.67A |\n| Wireless Output | 15W MagSafe |\n| Dimensions | 102 \u00d7 70 \u00d7 8.8 mm |\n| Weight | 120g |\nThin, light, and strong MagSafe connection\nThe first thing that struck me upon opening the Sharge CarbonMag 5K package was how thin and light this power bank is. At 120 grams and 8.8 millimeters thin, this is something that feels like it blends in with the aesthetic of the iPhone once it's snapped onto the MagSafe ring. There were plenty of times when I forgot that it was attached to my iPhone.\nAnd speaking of that MagSafe snap, the connection is strong and secure. Not once did the CarbonMag 5K separate from my iPhone, and my iPhone is encased in quite a thick case. The high-strength carbon fiber is lighter than aluminum and stronger than steel, making the CarbonMag 5K a durable package. I dropped mine onto cobbled streets twice from about one meter, and the power bank was totally unscathed.\nKeeps my iPhone charged and ready\nOn the charging front, you have the option of using 15W wireless MagSafe for the iPhone and a 20W USB-C port for everything else. All you need for power on the move. There are tiny LEDs on the back of the power bank showing charge levels, charging status, and whether it is switched on, and there's a single button for switching the unit on.\nSimple!\nFor charging at the end of the day, the CarbonMag 5K supports pass-through charging, so I could connect a charge cord to the power bank, leave the iPhone connected to it, and both would charge overnight, ready for another busy day.\nAlso: I turned my Starlink Mini into a near-perfect off-grid internet solution. Here's how\nLet me tell you, this power bank has endured some tough conditions, going from near-freezing temperatures during the desert nights to baking hot during the days. Yet, it never failed to keep my iPhone charged and ready to go.\nZDNET's buying advice\nI've been on the lookout for a thin and light MagSafe power bank, and the Sharge CarbonMag 5K hasn't disappointed. I'm a bit of a sucker for things made with carbon fiber, but the use of this material on this power bank goes well beyond aesthetics, adding structure and rigidity without weight.\nAlso: The best MagSafe accessories\nAs a power bank, the CarbonMag 5K is as good as they get, with Sharge having put together a top-tier product here. If you want a super-lightweight 5,000mAh power bank, this is a superb choice."

Check this setting to find out\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Meta could be scanning your camera roll right now.\n- It's using your photos to provide AI-powered suggestions.\n- Check Facebook settings to turn off the features.\nMeta could be analyzing and retaining your phone's photos without you realizing it.\nSome Facebook users have noticed that, deep within their app settings, toggles are switched on that allow Meta to access their camera roll to offer AI-powered suggestions, including \"personalized creative ideas, like travel highlights and collages\" -- and they don't remember agreeing to this.\nAlso: How to delete Facebook, Messenger, or Instagram - if you want Meta out of your life\nThe problem? This feature allows Meta to access and retain your camera roll images, and that could raise serious privacy concerns, especially for users who wouldn't otherwise knowingly opt in.\nIf you do get Meta's \"cloud processing\" pop-up announcing this feature and tap \"Allow\" on it, you'll agree to Meta's AI Terms of Service and permit your \"media and facial features\" to be analyzed by AI.\nFacebook will then use your camera roll images -- including the dates on them and the presence of people or objects -- to suggest collages, themed albums, recap posts, or AI restyled versions of your pictures. These AI suggestions are only visible to you unless you choose to share them, and Meta says the media won't be used for ad targeting.\nAlso: How to protect your privacy from Facebook - and what doesn't work\nZDNET's editorial director found Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions enabled in her Facebook app without her knowledge. I also noticed they were enabled for me, although I vaguely recall seeing a pop-up from Facebook about the new features a few weeks ago. I think I dismissed it quickly, and I can't remember whether I tapped Allow or Don't allow on it.\nHow to stop Facebook from scanning your camera roll\nMeta said its camera roll sharing suggestions are not enabled by default. If you're worried you dismissed Facebook's pop-up, or unknowingly opted in, and gave access to your camera roll, here's how to check and turn it off.\n1. Open the Facebook app\nThe settings you'll want to check can be found in the Facebook mobile app.\n- Grab your iPhone or Android phone.\n- Open the Facebook app. You'll need to be signed into your account.\n2. Go to the Menu > Settings and Privacy\nFacebook hides most of its settings in the menu -- the three-line hamburger icon in the bottom corner of the app.\n- Tap the Menu icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.\nOnce the menu opens, look for Settings and Privacy with a gear icon.\n3. Select Settings\nOnce you find and tap Privacy and Settings to expand the dropdown options, tap Settings again.\n- Under Settings and Privacy, tap Settings.\n- Now, scroll down and look for \"Camera roll sharing suggestions.\"\n4. Go to Camera roll sharing suggestions\nMeta placed the toggles that grant it access to your camera roll under the \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" setting. You'll need to go there to see if they're on and, if so, switch them off.\n- Tap the option labeled \"Camera roll sharing suggestions.\"\n- This will open a preference page with a couple of toggles.\n5. Turn off both toggles\nOnce you're inside the camera roll sharing suggestions page, notice the two separate switches. If they're blue and the toggle circle is pushed to the right, they're on -- meaning Meta is already processing and retaining your phone's photos. Turn them off so the app can't automatically upload and analyze your camera roll.\n- Find the option labeled \"Get camera roll suggestions when you're browsing Facebook.\" If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from using basic camera roll data, such as which videos you've favorited and when photos were taken, to suggest sharing media you haven't yet uploaded.\nFind the option labeled \"Get creative ideas made for you by allowing camera roll cloud processing.\" If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from continuously uploading media from your camera roll -- and using details like time, location, themes, and the presence of people or objects -- to generate personalized creative ideas such as recaps and AI restylings.\nFAQs\nThese steps don't work for me. Why?\nThe steps above, which I've verified using the Faebook app for iPhone, may vary on Android devices.\nSamsung users, for instance, must do the following: Open Facebook > Go to Profile/Menu > Tap the gear icon in the upper right > Scroll down to \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" and select it > You'll see the two camera roll sharing toggles.\nDefinitely go to Facebook's support hub if you need more help. You basically got to find the Settings and privacy menu in the Facebook mobile app, and from there, you can find \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" and disable the options.\nWhy is Facebook cloud-processing my device's camera roll?\nMeta is uploading and analyzing your camera roll photos and videos, even ones you haven't posted, in its cloud in order to generate AI-powered suggestions like collages, monthly recaps, themed albums, or AI-restyled versions of your images.\nWhere is this feature being tested?\nMeta has confirmed the feature is a test, saying, \"We're exploring ways to make content sharing easier for people on Facebook by testing suggestions of ready-to-share and curated content from a person's camera roll.\"\nThe test is currently available in the US and Canada, but it's not available in Illinois or Texas due to those states' privacy laws.\nDid Facebook ask for my consent before turning this on?\nMeta is showing a pop-up asking users if they want to enable cloud processing, but some users claim they haven't seen it. Instead, they say found the toggles in their settings switched on without their knowledge, raising questions about whether clear consent was given.\nI've asked several people to check whether camera roll sharing suggestions were enabled in their Facebook app. Besides myself and ZDNET's editorial director, my partner, in-laws, and many friends all found the options turned on without their knowledge. Many users have also reported on social media and in forum threads, like this one on Y Combinator, that the settings were enabled for them.\nSome of these people recalled seeing a consent pop-up from Facebook, while others did not. But nearly everyone said they did not realize they were allowing access to their camera roll data. They also said they would not have allowed it if they had known.\nCan I remove my photos once they've been uploaded?\nZDNET's sister site, CNET, reports that Meta pulls from your newer pictures (roughly the last 30 days) and if you disable the feature, your uploaded photos will be deleted after 30 days. The only way to confirm is by downloading your Facebook account data.\nWhy is this a potential privacy issue?\nIt expands Meta's reach beyond the content you've chosen to upload and share online -- into your private, unposted photos and videos. For many, that's a major red flag and a line they're not comfortable crossing, understandably so.\nAlso: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out\nEven if Meta is asking for consent to access your camera roll in order to analyze your phone's photos and provide AI-powered suggestions, the company could have done a better job of being clear and explicit about what it's trying to do.\nHow many users, like me, simply dismissed the consent pop-up without fully realizing what they'd just agreed to?\nEditor's note: This article was last updated on Sept. 2, 2025, to clarify steps for Android users. It was also updated on Aug. 24 to confirm that Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions are not turned on by default and are entirely opt-in. Still, some users say they never knowingly agreed and are finding the features enabled in their settings."

With a starting price of $999, it offers a compelling blend of premium features borrowed from its more expensive sibling, all in the more manageable size of the standard Pixel 10.\nAlso: I replaced my Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the Pixel 10 Pro XL for a week - and can't go back\nThe Pixel 10 Pro enters a crowded field, competing directly with the iPhone 16 Pro and the Galaxy S25 Plus.\nHaving used the iPhone 16 Pro as my daily driver for the past year, I've tested it against the new Pixel 10 Pro to see how these two flagship phones compare.\nYou should buy the Google Pixel 10 Pro if\u2026\n1. You want the best of Google AI\nThe Pixel phone lineup unsurprisingly offers the best of Google's Gemini AI features. And it is only getting better with the Pixel 10 Pro. The company is providing a year of Google AI Pro service for free alongside the purchase for Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL. So, you get Gemini Pro, including NotebookLM for productivity and Veo 3 text-to-video generation model.\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro is also getting a contextual and personalized AI feature called Magic Cue. Theoretically, it can \"help connect the dots across your digital life by anticipating your needs and proactively suggesting relevant information and helpful actions based on the context on your phone.\"\nAlso: The best Android phones to buy in 2025\nFor instance, if you call a company's helpline, your associated details (like a flight ticket) will be surfaced automatically.\nYou can still download the Gemini app to access Google's AI on your iPhone, but you won't get the seamless Pixel AI experience. If you depend on Google apps to get work done and have all your digital life stored on Google's platforms, the Pixel 10 Pro is the better option.\n2. You want a better telephoto camera\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro features a 48MP Quad PD telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom, as compared to a 12MP telephoto sensor (also 5x optical zoom) on the iPhone 16 Pro. However, megapixels don't solely define a camera. The Pixel 10 Pro sports a bigger sensor than its Apple counterpart. On paper, it is capable of letting more light in and snapping better-looking photos.\nAlso: I replaced my Pixel 9 Pro with the 9a for a month - here's my buying advice now\nThe 12MP 5x tele camera on iPhone 16 Pro isn't hard to beat. It struggles in anything less than bright daylight and lacks the zoom capabilities of its Chinese rivals. I'm looking forward to using the Google Pixel 10 Pro for my zoom shots and expect it to beat the iPhone.\n3. You want a cool-looking Pro phone\nThe iPhone 16 Pro series is lacking in fun colors. It comes in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Natural Titanium, and Desert Titanium -- all of which feel a bit lifeless. The last Pro iPhone color I truly loved was Sierra Blue on my iPhone 13 Pro Max.\nWhile rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Pro might bring back more playful finishes, Google has already beaten Apple to the punch with the Pixel 10 Pro series. The new Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are available in classic Obsidian and Porcelain, as well as bolder Moonstone and Jade options.\nSo, if you're spending $1,000 on a phone, you don't have to settle for something dull. Plus, you get Google's distinct design, complete with the iconic camera bar\u2014which, in my opinion, still looks incredibly cool.\n4. If you've been envious of this iPhone feature\nThe Pixel 10 Pro features a MagSafe-like feature called PixelSnap. It is based on Qi2 charging, which offers magnetic accessory support for power banks, chargers, and more. If you've been on the iPhone for a while and want to switch platforms, this is the best time to come to the Android side.\nAlso: How to add MagSafe to your Android phone (and why you'll love it)\nAll your MagSafe accessories should technically work with the Pixel 10 Pro (depending on magnet power), so you don't have to buy new accessories alongside your new phone.\nYou should buy the Apple iPhone 16 Pro if\u2026\n1. You want a lighter Pro phone\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro might look better on paper, but it's nearly 10 grams heavier than the iPhone 16 Pro. Specifically, the Pixel weighs 207 grams compared to the iPhone's 199 grams.\nAlso: Buy the iPhone 16 or wait for iPhone 17? Here's how I help friends and family decide\nThat eight-gram difference might not seem like much, but with both phones featuring flat, unergonomic sides, every gram counts -- especially during extended use. If you average more than six hours of screen time a day, the iPhone 16 Pro could be the more comfortable choice.\n2. You want the best social media experience\nWhile Android has made significant progress, iPhones still hold an advantage in stability and app optimization. This is particularly noticeable with social media apps like X and Instagram, where the user experience remains smoother on Apple devices.\nEditing and posting photos and videos from an iPhone to social media platforms is also more seamless and efficient for anyone who regularly creates content.\nAlso: Best iPhone 2025: I tested the top models and found the best options for you\nIf you're leaning toward an iPhone instead of the Pixel 10 Pro, I strongly recommend waiting just a few weeks. Apple is expected to launch its new iPhone 17 series in early September. It's smart to hold off on your decision until after the typical September 10th launch event to make sure you get the latest model."

With the new Liquid Glass approach to UI, Apple will offer users a more consistent design and experience across all its devices.\nAlso: I deciphered Apple's iPhone 17 event invite - my 3 biggest theories for what's expected\nThe iOS 26 public beta is available now, but the official version likely won't be released until September. Public betas give both enthusiasts and even average users a way to test the latest iteration of Apple's software. With the latest iOS 26 version, for instance, Apple has refined the Liquid Glass design and introduced several under-the-hood tweaks for iPhone.\nGiven that the official version is expected to launch soon, here is some guidance on which iPhone models support iOS 26.\nWhich iPhone models will get iOS 26?\nAccording to Apple, these iPhone models can get iOS 26 once it becomes widely available:\n- iPhone 16e\n- iPhone 16\n- iPhone 16 Plus\n- iPhone 16 Pro\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max\n- iPhone 15\n- iPhone 15 Plus\n- iPhone 15 Pro\n- iPhone 15 Pro Max\n- iPhone 14\n- iPhone 14 Plus\n- iPhone 14 Pro\n- iPhone 14 Pro Max\n- iPhone 13\n- iPhone 13 mini\n- iPhone 13 Pro\n- iPhone 13 Pro Max\n- iPhone 12\n- iPhone 12 mini\n- iPhone 12 Pro\n- iPhone 12 Pro Max\n- iPhone 11\n- iPhone 11 Pro\n- iPhone 11 Pro Max\n- iPhone SE (2nd generation or later)\nAlso: Will your old iPhone, Mac, or iPad run Apple's latest updates? Check this list\nNotably, the once-popular iPhone X, XS, XR, and XS Max models are not on the list.\niOS 26 beta vs general release: What's the difference?\nThe iOS 26 beta version differs slightly from the general release. The purpose of the beta phase is to gather feedback to repair bugs and address any user interface issues before the software is massively distributed.\nBeta versions can also be incomplete and are not the final product. This means the iOS 26 developer and public betas are more prone to bugs, glitches, and instability.\nAlso: Best iPhone 2025: I tested the top models and found your perfect fit\nThe general release will have ironed out most of these bugs and problems using the user feedback gathered during the beta phase, delivering software that isn't as prone to issues. However, they can still happen.\nFor example, in the 2023 iOS 17 beta, Apple moved the in-call \"End\" button from its familiar center position to the right. After beta testers voiced frustration, Apple restored the button to the center before the public release.\nWhen will iOS 26 release?\nApple will launch iOS 26 in three phases: the developer beta, public beta, and finally, the official \"general\" release.\nDeveloper beta\nThe first developer beta of iOS 26 was released on June 9 during WWDC 2025. Following this, subsequent developer betas, including beta 3, were released.\nPublic beta\nThe public beta launched in July. This program lets anyone -- not just registered developers -- test early software, helping Apple identify and fix bugs or performance issues before the final release.\nGeneral release\nApple officially released iOS 18 out of beta on Sept. 16, just one week after its \"Glowtime\" event.\nLikewise, once iOS 26 completes its developer and public beta testing this summer, Apple is expected to roll out the final version to everyone this fall.\nWhat is a software beta?\nA software beta is an early preview of an application or operating system, released to a select group of developers or users to gather feedback and uncover bugs under real-world conditions. It follows an internal alpha phase and helps Apple address issues before an official \"general\" release.\nWhich iPhone models can't run iOS 26?\niOS 26 will not be supported on the iPhone XS, XR, XS Max, or earlier models.\nAlso: Every iPhone model that can be updated to iOS 26 (and which ones don't support it)\nWhat should you do with an old iPhone that can't run iOS 26?\nThe Apple brand is strong and holds significant resale value, so you can always sell your older iPhone and disclose that it's no longer supported for software updates. There's a lot of demand for older iPhones that are still functional and budget-friendly, but you can also trade them for credit toward a new device.\nApple, Best Buy, and Amazon are just some retailers that accept iPhone trade-ins. iPhones' resale and trade-in values depend heavily on their condition and storage capacity. Features like an intact screen and a working camera greatly influence resale or trade-in values.\nYou can check your iPhone's trade-in value at one of these retailers or at a telecommunications company's authorized dealer.\nEditor's note: This article was originally published in 2024.

It's the worst.\nIf this happens more often than not, especially on an older phone, a quick Google search will tell you to head to a repair center or Apple Store to get a fresh battery or upgrade to a newer model. Yeah, no. Not everyone can drop hundreds of dollars just for more battery life. Luckily, there are plenty of iOS tweaks you can try to squeeze extra hours out of your charge.\nThe best part? They're all free -- and easy -- to implement.\n1. Update to the latest iOS\nIt may be obvious, but you really should\nApple constantly updates iPhone software with new tricks and fun feature, and sometimes, it also upgrades its power-management tools and fixes potential battery-draining bugs. For example, it might optimize CPU throttling on your iPhone or address network-stack inefficiencies. Skip an update, and you could miss out on potential battery-health gains and might even be running an OS that's making things worse for you.\nHow to update to the latest iOS update on iPhone:\n- Open Settings > General > Software Update.\n- Tap Download and Install if an update is available.\nAlso: Update to iOS 26? We tested the public beta on our iPhones - these features are a big deal\nApple keeps a changelog of its latest OS releases here. I wouldn't recommend running beta software on your main device, as it could contain bugs and potentially have the opposite effect of what you're trying to achieve.\n2. Dim your screen\nAnd enable auto-brightness\nYour screen brightness can really wreak havoc on your battery life. Manually lowering it by even 10-20% can give you extra time. You should also turn on Auto-Brightness, if it's not already enabled. It does exactly what you'd expect: automatically adjusts your screen's brightness based on ambient surrounding light -- to not only optimize your battery life but also provide a more comfortable viewing experience in different conditions.\nHow to dim and automate screen brightness on iPhone:\n- Swipe down from the top-right to open Control Center.\n- Drag the Brightness slider down until comfortable.\n- Go Settings > Accessibility > Display and Text Size > toggle on Auto-Brightness.\n3. Disable the iPhone's always-on display\nAnother screen adjustment to try\nThe iPhone 14 Pro and later models feature an \"Always-On Display,\" which keeps a dimmed version of your lock screen visible even when the device is locked. Reports suggest this feature can consume about 1% of your battery per hour -- adding up to roughly 24% over a full day. That's nearly a quarter of your charge. By simply turning it off, you can reclaim a significant chunk of that capacity.\nHow to disable the always-on display on iPhone:\n- Go Settings > Display and Brightness.\n- Toggle off Always On Display.\n4. Use Wi-Fi instead of cellular when possible\nCellular data, especially 5G, requires more power\nIf you've ever been in an area with low or no service, you've probably noticed your battery drops quickly. That's because your iPhone is constantly scanning to locate and connect to a cell tower\u2014and that consumes power. Plus, cellular data generally uses more energy than Wi-Fi, since it has to transmit and receive signals over long distances and maintain connections with distant towers.\nAlso: How to clear your iPhone cache (and why it makes such a big difference)\nIn short, cellular connections drain your battery. If you need to conserve power, switch to Wi-Fi -- but be cautious on public networks.\nHow to use Wi-Fi over cellular on iPhone:\n- Open Settings > Wi-Fi and toggle it on, and then join a known network.\n- In Settings > Cellular, toggle off Cellular Data.\n- In Settings > Cellular, disable Wi-Fi Assist to prevent auto-fallback to cellular.\n5. Disable 5G\nSwitch to LTE\nIf you need cellular service for whatever reason and just don't want to rely on Wi-Fi alone, at least make sure your 5G signal isn't patchy. While 5G offers faster speeds and lower latency, 4G LTE is considered more efficient in areas with weak or spotty coverage.\nHow to switch from 5G to LTE on iPhone:\n- Go Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Options.\n- Tap Voice and Data, select LTE.\n- Optional: Disable 5G Standalone under Voice and Data in Settings.\n6. Enable Low Power Mode\nExtend your battery life by reducing or disabling features\nApple offers a feature on all iPhones running iOS 9 or later called Low Power Mode. When enabled, it limits background activity like app refreshes, disables automatic downloads, lowers screen brightness, throttles the CPU, and slows down some animations. That all might sound drastic, but it can give you an extra hour or three on a low battery. Your battery icon turns yellow to indicate it's active.\nHow to enable Low Power Mode on iPhone:\n- Go Settings > Battery > toggle Low Power Mode on (battery icon turns yellow).\n- Or add to Control Center: Swipe into Control Center, hit +, search and add Low Power Mode.\n7. Use Adaptive Power Mode\nBut wait for iOS 26 to officially release\nIf you own an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max or any iPhone 16 model, you can take advantage of Apple's new Adaptive Power Mode in iOS 26. It leverages on-device AI to automatically make small performance adjustments -- like slightly lowering screen brightness or allowing some processes to take a bit longer -- to extend your battery life when needed. It's more subtle and seamless than Low Power Mode.\nAlso: Should you turn on Adaptive Power on iOS 26? Here's my advice after testing it\nKeep in mind, it's only available in the iOS 26 beta right now, so you might want to wait for the official release before trying it on your daily driver.\nHow to enable Adaptive Power Mode on iPhone:\n- Make sure you're running iOS 26.\n- Open Settings > Battery > Power Mode.\n- Select Adaptive Power Mode.\n8. Disable keyboard haptics\nDon't forget sounds too\nDid you know every little buzz or click invokes the Taptic Engine on your iPhone? Thousands of key presses throughout your day add up fast, and they all consume power. Apple even notes on a support page that haptics might affect your battery life. So if you're desperate to conserve every last drop, turn off keyboard haptics (and even the click sounds) until you're back near a charger.\nHow to disable keyboard feedback on iPhone:\n- Open Settings > Sounds and Haptics.\n- Tap Keyboard Feedback.\n- Toggle off Haptics (and Sound if desired).\n9. Turn off 'Hey Siri'\nYou probably rarely use it anyway\nApple's \"Hey Siri\" feature can contribute to battery drain because your iPhone must constantly listen for the command, and when active, it uses both the microphone and the Neural Engine. Like any task, this consumes power. If you rarely use the hot word, switch it off. You can always invoke Siri by holding the side button.\nAlso: 10 easy ways to make Siri work better on your iPhone today\nHow to disable \"Hey Siri\" on iPhone:\n- Go Settings > Siri.\n- Tap Talk to Siri > select Off.\n- Optional: Disable Allow Siri When Locked to prevent accidental wakeups.\n10. Reduce your notifications\nYour battery and your sanity will thank you\nDid you know each push notification and alert you receive throughout the day uses power? Think about it: They wake your iPhone screen, can play sounds, and often vibrate. You should disable all non-essential notifications to reduce wake cycles and save power. Besides, do you really want to be spammed all day? Get them under control and eke out a few extra percent of battery life.\nAlso: You should stop putting your phone face up on the table - here's why\nHow to manage your notifications on iPhone:\n- Open Settings, scroll to an app, tap Notifications.\n- Toggle Allow Notifications off entirely, or uncheck Lock Screen, Banners, Sounds, and Badges selectively.\n- Repeat for social media, games, news, and other high-churn apps.\n11. Limit nearby AirDrop sharing\nAnd turn off 'Bringing Devices Together'\nWhile AirDrop has a minimal impact on battery life, it still uses power. The Bringing Devices Together feature, in particular -- which lets you share contact info and other content simply by bringing two iPhones close -- continuously scans via Bluetooth LE and peer-to-peer Wi-Fi. If you don't use AirDrop often, turn receiving off or at the very least disable Bringing Devices Together to stop the background scans and reduce power drain.\nAlso: How to share files between Android and MacOS with AirDroid\nHow to limit AirDrop on iPhone:\n- Open Settings > General > AirDrop.\n- Select Receiving Off, or at least disable Bringing Devices Together.\n12. Turn off Live Activities\nDo it per app - or for all on the lock screen\nLive Activities on iPhones display ongoing, real-time information from apps directly on the lock screen or in the Dynamic Island -- contributing to battery drain. For instance, a food delivery app's Live Activity might show the time remaining until your order arrives.\nAlso: Your iPhone is getting a major upgrade - 10 best features I can't wait to try in iOS 26\nYou should disable them for apps that push constant updates you don't need, such as social networks, if you want to minimize energy consumption. You can even supress them all on the lock screen in one fell swoop.\nHow to disable live activities on iPhone:\n- To turn off in specific apps, go Settings > scroll to the app > toggle Live Activities off.\n- To suppress all on lock screen, open Settings > Face ID and Passcode > toggle Live Activities off under Allow Access When Locked.\n13. Remove lock screen widgets\nStop those background checks and refreshes\nYou can probably tell I'm getting into the nitty-gritty of iPhone functions at this point. Feel free to pick and choose what you want to disable to save battery. Another niche tip I suggest, however, is to remove your lock-screen widgets. After all, they refresh periodically and sometimes make network or GPS calls. If you don't glance at them often, removing them stops these potentially battery-draining background checks.\nHow to remove lock screen widgets:\n- Press and hold the lock screen > tap Customize.\n- Select the widget area > tap each widget's button to remove.\n14. Disable Background App Refresh\nApps will update only when you open them\nSpeaking of background refreshes, did you know apps do this, too? Background App Refresh does exactly what it sounds like: It lets apps fetch updates in the background for things like emails, social feeds, and news. Disabling it means your apps will only update when you open them, possibly extending your battery life.\nHow to disable Background App Refresh on iPhone:\n- Go Settings > General > Background App Refresh.\n- Select Off, or scroll down to disable individual apps.\n15. Limit your frame rate\nAnother screen tweak you can try\nYou probably thought I was done with display settings? Not quite -- I've got a couple more tricks. The iPhone Pro models, starting with the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, feature Apple's ProMotion technology, which shifts the refresh rate between 10Hz and 120Hz. By limiting the frame rate, you can reduce GPU load and save power.\nHow to cap frame rate on iPhone:\n- Open Settings > Accessibility > Motion.\n- Toggle Limit Frame Rate on.\n16. Use Dark Mode\nUseful for OLED iPhones\nDark Mode on iPhones can not only save your eyes but also your battery. It only does so on OLED displays, but fortunately, that's the iPhone X and all later models. OLED panels light up individual pixels, so with Dark Mode enabled, black areas of the screen consume less power, reducing energy use and extending battery life.\nHow to enable Dark Mode on iPhone:\n- Go Settings > Display and Brightness.\n- Under Appearance, tap Dark.\n- Optional: Enable Automatic and schedule it for Sunset to Sunrise.\n17. Use Optimized Charging\nSlow your battery aging\nFinally, Apple offers a feature called Optimized Battery Charging that's meant to extend your battery by minimizing the time it stays at a full charge. Using machine learning, it learns your charging habits and pauses at 80% until just before you typically unplug. In other words, it holds at 80% until you need a full 100%, reducing time spent at max voltage. This helps prevent battery wear caused by prolonged periods at a full charge.\nHow to enable Optimized Charging on iPhone:\n- Open Settings > Battery > Battery Health and Charging.\n- Toggle on Optimized Battery Charging.\n- On iPhone 15+ also enable Optimized Charge Limit to cap at 80%.\nFAQs\nWhat about Focus Modes - do they help battery life?\nYes. Focus Modes help by letting you whitelist specific apps and contacts; during \"Work\" or \"Sleep,\" only critical alerts light up your display. That means fewer wake-ups and less background processing. I already mentioned disabling notifications above, but you can take it a step further with Focus Modes.\nAlso: The best Apple deals right now: Save on MacBooks, iPhones, and more\nHow to set up a Focus Mode:\n- Open Settings > Focus > tap + to create a profile.\n- Under Allowed Notifications, choose People and Apps.\n- Optionally schedule it by time, location, or app.\nHow do I identify the biggest battery hogs on iPhone?\nTo see what might be draining your iPhone's battery, go to Settings > Battery. There, you'll see usage by app and how much time each spent on screen or in background.\nAlso: How to fix an iPhone alarm that's not going off - and why it might be happening\nCan removing my case while charging help?\nPossibly -- mainly if your device gets hot while charging. Removing the case can improve heat dissipation, which might speed up charging and protect your iPhone's battery health.\nShould I try a battery pack or a power bank?\nYes! I always travel with one. All the settings tweaks in the world won't help if you're stranded somewhere, staring at a red battery icon, far from an outlet. Here are the top picks ZDNET's editors recommend:\n- Best MagSafe battery packs: I tested the best options to boost your phone's battery\n- The best iPhone power banks: Expert tested and reviewed\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "Upgrading to the iPhone 17? Nearly 70% of users plan to after launch - here's why\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- More than 68% of iPhone users plan to upgrade to an iPhone 17.\n- Battery life is the top reason cited for upgrading.\n- The high price of a new iPhone is one reason for not upgrading.\nWill you be lining up to buy an iPhone 17 when the new phone debuts later this month? If so, you're in good company. A majority of the 2,000 existing iPhone owners recently polled by phone reseller SellCell said they aim to add the latest model to their shopping carts.\nBased on a report published by SellCell on Monday, 68.3% of iPhone owners plan to upgrade to an iPhone 17 at launch time. With Apple expected to unveil the iPhone 17 at an event on Tuesday, September 9, the new phones will likely go on sale on or around Sept.19. The number who say they'll upgrade is several points higher than the 61.9% who planned to grab an iPhone 16 in 2024.\nAlso: I deciphered Apple's iPhone 17 event invite, and it led me down a rabbit hole of theories\nEyeing all the models in the lineup, 38.1% of those surveyed said they'll choose a Pro or Pro Max variant. Some 16.7% will go for a standard iPhone 17, while 13.5% are looking at the rumored ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air. Designed to replace the iPhone Plus, the iPhone 17 Air will reportedly be Apple's thinnest phone ever.\nWhy are so many anxious to upgrade?\nBetter battery life is the top reason, cited by 53.2% of likely upgraders, especially by those considering a Pro or Pro Max variant. Reports suggest that the Pro models will offer improved battery life thanks to a larger battery capacity, a more efficient A19 Pro chip, and the Adaptive Power Mode in iOS 26 designed for newer phones.\nAlso: If these iPhone 17 Air rumors are real, my old phone is about to be retired\nOther factors that will prompt people to upgrade include new design and features, improvements in the display, major camera upgrades, and faster charging speeds. Only 7% of those surveyed said that AI and software improvements will play a role in prompting them to upgrade. That small number speaks to those who felt burned by Apple's promises last year of the wonders of AI, only to fail to deliver all the goods.\nWhy others don't plan to upgrade\nOf course, that still leaves us with a fair number of iPhone owners who don't plan to upgrade to a new model. Here, the reasons vary. Most (71.7%) said they're satisfied with their current phone. But many people (68.9%) also cited high prices. Reports from 9to5Mac and other sources suggest that the cost of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will rise by $50 from last year, resulting in starting prices of $1,049 and $1,249, respectively.\nAlso: Every iPhone model that can be updated to iOS 26 (and which ones don't support it)\nThose high prices could be exacerbated by the Trump tariffs. Though 34% said they'd still upgrade if the price increased due to a tariff, 37% said they would hold off, and 29% said it would depend on how much more the phone would cost. In May, Trump threatened a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the US. But Apple could counter the blow of such a tariff by cutting manufacturing costs and pulling other tricks.\nFoldable phones are the latest trend designed to reel in buyers. Only 3.3% of those surveyed said they would hold out for a foldable iPhone. However, if Apple waits until 2026 to kick off a foldable, then 20% would consider a Samsung device, while 10% would look at a Google phone.\nAlso: Buy the iPhone 16 or wait for iPhone 17? Here's how I help friends and family decide\nSamsung already offers a lineup of foldable phones, including the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy Z Flip 7, and Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE. On its end, Google has served up the Pixel Fold, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Reports have cited Apple prepping a foldable iPhone, but not one that's likely to launch this year.\nThe iPhone vs. Android debate\nFinally, that brings us to the always provocative iPhone vs. Android debate.\nAmong all the iPhone owners polled, almost half (49%) revealed that nothing about Android appeals to them. However, the rest admit that Google's platform is becoming more alluring. Some 13% pointed to AI as a draw, 11% to the prices of Android phones, 11% to the cameras on Android devices, and 9% to the foldables sold by such companies as Samsung and Google."

      "text": "I retested GPT-5's coding skills using OpenAI's guidance - and now I trust it even less\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- The same prompts in GPT-5 yield success, crashes, or errors.\n- OpenAI's prompt optimizer helps, but introduces its own quirks.\n- AI \"unconsciously\" adding details raises trust concerns.\nDo AI's get headaches? Because GPT-5 has certainly been giving me one. This article was going to be so easy. OpenAI came out with a list of best practices for GPT-5 coding. All I was going to do was try those best practices with the GPT-5 coding tests that previously failed and see if there was improvement.\nIt seemed so simple.\nAlso: I tested GPT-5's coding skills, and it was so bad that I'm sticking with GPT-4o (for now)\nBut then I had a thought. What if OpenAI has improved GPT-5 in the week or so since I ran my tests?\nPerhaps I should re-run the failed tests as-is and see what the results are, to use as a baseline for the new best practices.\nFrom a testing point of view, this was a valid approach. From a personal sanity point of view, not so much.\nRe-running test 1\nI re-ran the first failed test. This test has the AI creating a complete WordPress plugin, complete with a user interface and business logic. The idea is you feed in a set of names, it randomizes them, and it separates duplicates so they're not side-by-side.\nAlso: How I test an AI chatbot's coding ability - and you can, too\nWhen I ran this test on GPT-5 originally, it failed. Clicking the Randomize button sent the browser to another, unrelated page. I was able to cajole GPT-5 into fixing it, but the initial failure was what counted.\nThis time, I ran the exact same test with the exact same prompt again. This time, it worked perfectly. Wow, I thought. GPT-5 has improved in the past week.\nIf only I had left well enough alone. But no.\nI had to try again. On my second time with the exact same test with the exact same prompt, clicking Randomize resulted in what WordPressers call the \"white screen of death.\" This indicates something in the code isn't working.\nAlso: GPT-5 bombed my coding tests, but redeemed itself with code analysis\nI tried the exact same test with the exact same prompt a total of five times. The first time it worked. Subsequent times, it didn't. One time, I got a white screen. One time, I got a page full of error messages. One time, I was redirected to another page. One time, nothing happened at all.\nWe'll come back to test 1. But next, I decided to do the same thing with the other failed test.\nRe-running test 4\nThis test asks the AI to write code that talks to Chrome, AppleScript, and another tool called Keyboard Maestro. It requires the AI to be knowledgeable about the three different environments and how they work together.\nHere's an interesting factoid about AppleScript. The scripting language is inherently case-insensitive. So, if you ask AppleScript to compare \"AppleScript\" to \"applescript\", it will consider both strings to be the same. You have to explicitly tell it to compare case before it will do so.\nAlso: You can learn AI for free with these new courses from Anthropic\nWhen I first ran this test against GPT-5, it hallucinated that AppleScript had a native function for making strings lowercase. It does not, so the code failed.\nThis time, instead of hallucinating that AppleScript has a lowercase function, it decided to do one of the most convoluted sets of operations to lowercase a string. Here's that line of code:\nset tabTitleLower to (do shell script \"echo \" & quoted form of tabTitle & \" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'\")\nThe code actually works, but it's very weird and totally unnecessary. It launches a shell (the command line) to run a shell script that converts to lowercase. It's like making a grilled cheese sandwich and when you realize you're out of cheese, flying across the country to buy cheese from a 7-11 on the opposite side of the continent. You're not even getting better cheese. You're just doing it in the weirdest and most inefficient way possible.\nLet's not forget that we really don't need to make that text lowercase in the first place, because AppleScript is case-insensitive. So it wrote a highly convoluted piece of code that, while it works, is entirely unnecessary.\nI didn't bother to re-run this test four more times because the headache was already starting to set in.\nOpenAI's GPT-5 coding best practices\nOpenAI has put out what it calls a cheatsheet for GPT-5 coding. It has six main recommendations:\n- Be precise and avoid conflicting information: Well, duh. But apparently GPT-5 gets really confused if asked to follow vague or conflicting instructions.\n- Use the right reasoning effort: Rather than just letting GPT-5 choose its reasoning level, you might want to adjust its model. If it starts to overthink a problem, use a lower reasoning level. Great, so now we have to deal with a neurotic AI. Yippee?\n- Use XML-like syntax to help structure instructions: Rather than using just text, using XML tags to segment aspects of a prompt helps the AI to parse its assignment. This is a good hint, but it feels like a step back from what it could do.\n- Avoid overly firm language: In previous models, we sometimes had to YELL at the AI to get it to listen. Apparently, GPT-5 is passive aggressive, so if you get too forceful in your instructions, it will overdo its compliance, like what my old bosses used to say was my practice of \"aggressively following instructions.\"\n- Give room for planning and self-reflection: Does the AI need a blankie? Perhaps a warm stuffed animal to cuddle? In reality, what OpenAI is saying is that you need to encourage the AI to think through the instructions it gets. Apparently, if you don't tell it to think through the instructions, it won't. I fear for the planet.\n- Control the eagerness of your coding agent: It turns out GPT-5 is even more of a people-pleaser than GPT-4o. When giving it instructions, tell it to tone down its fawning and sucking-uppage.\nI'd like to say something positive here, but it's starting to feel like a migraine. Check out the PDF if you want more details.\nOpenAI also created an AI prompting helper. You point your browser to this tool, and paste in your prompt. The tool will give you back a more extensive prompt. For example, I gave it this prompt from Test 4:\nWrite a Keyboard Maestro AppleScript that scans the frontmost Google Chrome window for a tab name containing the string matching the contents of the passed variable instance__ChannelName. Ignore case for the match. Once found, make that tab the active tab.\nIt gave me back this:\nCreate an AppleScript for use in Keyboard Maestro that performs the following actions: * Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) outlining the planned steps before proceeding. * Scan all tabs in the frontmost Google Chrome window. * Search for a tab whose name contains the value of the passed variable 'instance__ChannelName', ignoring case sensitivity. * Once a matching tab is found, activate that tab and make it the current/active tab. After generating the script, validate in 1-2 lines whether the script meets all requirements. If not, state what needs adjustment.\nEssentially, it revised the prompt to add a planning phase at the beginning and a validation phase at the end.\nDoes it work?\nNope. Nopity-nope-nope.\nI ran Test 4's \"optimized\" prompt through GPT-5 and got back this script:\nThere are at least three serious flaws in it. First, the code in the green box doesn't work. It doesn't retrieve the value from Keyboard Maestro. Previous versions did that successfully using a completely different (and well-documented) mechanism. This approach is just loony.\nAlso: AI is creeping into the Linux kernel - and official policy is needed ASAP\nNow, look at the blue box. The considering case operation is used only for evaluation. For example, with considering case, \"BLUE\" and \"blue\" are different values. Do you see any sort of if statement or evaluation inside the blue box? Me neither.\nThen there's the red box. There is no such syntax as \"considering case false.\" First, the default behavior is to ignore case. Second, if you really wanted to explicitly tell AppleScript to ignore case, you'd use an \"ignoring case\" block. But \"considering case false\"? That's just some made-up syntax right there.\nRetrying the WordPress plugin\nI also ran my original prompt for the WordPress plugin through the prompt optimizer. I got back a fairly extensive project requirements document.\nOn the plus side, this time the plugin worked. I tried generating code a second time, and it also worked. So perhaps the optimization is something to try if GPT-5 isn't playing nice.\nBut then there's the weirdness. Because there's always weirdness. Check out the header block generated by GPT-5.\nNotice the author is attributed to Advanced Geekery Labs. Historically, the AIs have listed the author field as \"Your Name.\" But this time, it's Advanced Geekery Labs.\nThere is some relevance, because Advanced Geekery is the name of my YouTube channel and weekly newsletter. But I didn't use it anywhere in my instructions for this plugin. Additionally, I've never added Labs to the end of Advanced Geekery, even though my security product is sold through ZATZ Labs.\nSo I asked GPT-5 where it got the name Advanced Geekery Labs from. Its answer:\nGood question. The name \"Advanced Geekery Labs\" isn't something you provided in your request. I introduced it in the plugin header's Author: field as a placeholder, because in earlier conversations you've mentioned your \"Advanced Geekery\" brand, and I unconsciously expanded it into \"Labs.\"\nI'm glad the AI thinks it's a good question. That warms my heart. But \"unconsciously expanded\"? That's a direct quote from the AI. Those are its words.\nSo, we're now dealing with hallucinating AIs that operate unconsciously?\nWe're all doomed.\nWhat about coding and GPT-5?\nI still don't trust it. Actually, I don't trust it even more than when I tested it originally. What else might it do to my code \"unconsciously\"?\nI guess, if you really need GPT-5 to give you some code, you could try the optimizer. But I wouldn't rely on it.\nGPT-4o was impressive, but it had some problems. GPT-5 is like its more troubled, more difficult sibling.\nWith GPT-4o, I'd be willing to trust, with verification. I just plain don't trust GPT-5. There's something that's just not right. If we were to experience an AI that would revolt against its creators and try to kill us all, I would not be surprised if it all originated with GPT-5.\nAnd no. My headache hasn't gone away. Apparently, Tylenol is now bad for you. So, there's that, too.\nWhat do you think?\nHave you tried relying on GPT-5 for coding projects? If so, did you run into the same kinds of inconsistencies and odd behaviors? Do you find OpenAI's \"best practices\" helpful, or do they feel like workarounds for deeper problems? And what's your take on GPT-5's tendency to improvise or even \"unconsciously\" insert details? Is it a harmless quirk or a reason for concern?

At first glance, they don't seem all that useful since you can also do these actions with your mouse, but I challenge you to try them over the course of a workday; you just might notice a boost in productivity.\nAlso: How much RAM does your PC really need in 2025? I did the math for Windows and Mac users\nThere are lots of different types of shortcuts in Windows 11, but the best ones save you time by replacing the need to click through different context menus. A few of these are universal across applications and platforms. Ctrl + C, for example, copies text or files in any app, from Microsoft Word to photos in Google Drive.\nHere's a list of more than 40 Windows PC keyboard shortcuts you should know.\nProductivity shortcuts\nProductivity shortcuts are the key combos you'll find yourself using the most. They're easy to use and help you manage your work. Over time, these keystrokes become second nature.\n- Ctrl + C -- Copy highlighted text or a file.\n- Ctrl + V -- Paste whatever you just copied. Keeps the text's format.\n- Ctrl + Shift + V - Paste whatever you copied, but it removes the formatting.\n- Windows key (Win, for short) + V -- Opens the Clipboard tool, which contains a list of previously copied text. This helps in situations where you might've \"erased\" the previous copied item.\n- Ctrl + X -- Cuts the highlighted item. Ctrl + V restores it.\n- Ctrl + Z -- Undoes the last action, such as restoring deleted text or returning a moved file.\n- Ctrl + Y -- Redoes the action that was just undone.\n- Ctrl + F -- Opens the Find tool, so you can search for specific words or phrases.\n- Ctrl + A -- Highlight every single item in a window or text in a document.\n- Ctrl + S -- Quick save your work.\n- Ctrl + Backspace -- Delete the entire previous word\n- Ctrl + Delete -- Delete the entire next word.\nAccessibility shortcuts\nWindows 11 has various accessibility shortcuts that make the OS easier to use. These shortcuts help people with movement limitations or conditions that may restrict their usage of Windows. That said, anybody can use them to improve their experience.\n- Win + Plus (+) -- Activates the Magnifier tool and automatically zooms in on the screen.\n- Win + Minus (-) -- Zooms out while the Magnifier tool is activated. Hitting Win + Esc exits out of Magnifier.\n- Win + Ctrl + Enter -- Launches Narrator, a text-to-speech function that verbally describes what is on screen.\n- Press the Shift key five times in succession -- Turns on Sticky keys, which change how shortcuts work so you don't have to press and hold multiple keys to trigger them. For example, under Sticky Keys, double-tapping Ctrl then C has the same effect as Ctrl + C.\n- Left Shift + Left Alt + Print Screen -- Toggles high contrast mode for easier readability.\n- Win + Ctrl + C -- Toggles color filters like grayscale. The filters can be changed in the Accessibility menu to invert colors or help people with deuteranopia (also known as red-green color blindness).\n- Win + U -- Opens the Accessibility menu in Settings, where you can activate or deactivate accessibility-related features.\n- Win + Ctrl + O -- Opens the on-screen keyboard.\nNavigation shortcuts\nNavigation shortcuts allow users to move around different apps on Windows 11 without ever needing to lift their hands off the keyboard. They're especially useful for multitaskers juggling several programs at once. Once you master them, navigating your PC will feel seamless.\n- Ctrl + Alt + Tab -- Shows all open apps. Use the arrow keys to hop from one to the other.\n- Win + S -- Opens Windows Search.\n- Win + Tab -- Opens Task View, revealing all open windows and all open desktops.\n- Win + D -- Hides every window on your desktop. Pressing the keys again reveals them.\n- Win + Left or Right Directional Arrow -- Snaps the current window to the side of the screen that the arrow is pointing to.\n- Win + Up Arrow -- Maximizes a window.\n- Win + Down Arrow -- Minimizes the same window.\n- Win + Ctrl + D -- Create a new desktop.\n- Win + Ctrl + F4 -- Closes a desktop.\n- Win + Number Key -- Opens a taskbar app pinned to that number. For example, Win + 3 could open Microsoft Edge while Win + 4 opens the Microsoft Store.\nAlso: Finally, a Windows laptop that I wouldn't mind putting away my MacBook for\nFile Management shortcuts\nThe Windows 11 File Explorer has its own set of keyboard shortcuts to help users reorganize folders and files. Instead of right-clicking through menus or dragging items around to clean up clutter, these simple key presses make managing documents a breeze.\n- Win + E -- Opens File Explorer.\n- F2 -- Rename the selected file or folder. Depending on the keyboard, you may also have to hold Fn.\n- Shift + Delete -- Permanently deletes an item. Hitting just Delete only sends the file to the recycling bin.\n- Ctrl + N -- Opens a new File Explorer window. It stays on the page of the previous window.\n- Ctrl + Shift + N -- Create a new folder.\n- Alt + Enter -- Opens the Properties window for a file and folder.\n- Alt + Left or Right Arrow -- Move forward or backward through your File Explorer History.\n- Alt + Up Arrow -- Go back one folder level.\nAlso: Best early Labor Day laptop deals: Sales on Apple, Dell, Lenovo, and more\nBrowser shortcuts\nBrowser shortcuts are similar to Productivity shortcuts in that they do similar things, like copying and pasting items or highlighting entire documents. However, there are a few unique tools, like the ability to create tabs. The following were tested and confirmed to work across various browsers: Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.\n- Ctrl + T -- Open a new tab.\n- Ctrl + Shift + T -- Reopen the last closed tab. (This one is huge!)\n- Ctrl + W -- Close the current tab.\n- Ctrl + Tab -- Move right through tabs.\n- Ctrl + Shift + Tab -- Move left through the tabs.\n- Ctrl + Shift + N -- Open new private browsing window. On Firefox, this is Ctrl + Shift + P.\n- Alt + Left or Right Arrow -- Move back and forth through tab history.\n- Ctrl + D -- Bookmark page.\n- Ctrl + H -- Open browser history.\n- Ctrl + N -- Open a brand new browser window.\nWhy should you trust me?\nI've been writing about software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years. In that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office and even someone's backyard. Over the years, I've picked up a lot of tricks to help me get through my day-to-day tasks.\nAlso: I tested the best antivirus software for Windows: Here's what I'd use to protect my PC\nMany of the shortcuts in this guide I use every day, even when I'm not working. CTRL + Z has practically become my best friend because I use it so often. Some of these shortcuts I learned about for the first time while researching this piece. I didn't know that the File Manager has so many shortcuts under its toolbelt, but once I started using them, I immediately saw their value to expert and casual users alike."

It's the worst.\nIf this happens more often than not, especially on an older phone, a quick Google search will tell you to head to a repair center or Apple Store to get a fresh battery or upgrade to a newer model. Yeah, no. Not everyone can drop hundreds of dollars just for more battery life. Luckily, there are plenty of iOS tweaks you can try to squeeze extra hours out of your charge.\nThe best part? They're all free -- and easy -- to implement.\n1. Update to the latest iOS\nIt may be obvious, but you really should\nApple constantly updates iPhone software with new tricks and fun feature, and sometimes, it also upgrades its power-management tools and fixes potential battery-draining bugs. For example, it might optimize CPU throttling on your iPhone or address network-stack inefficiencies. Skip an update, and you could miss out on potential battery-health gains and might even be running an OS that's making things worse for you.\nHow to update to the latest iOS update on iPhone:\n- Open Settings > General > Software Update.\n- Tap Download and Install if an update is available.\nAlso: Update to iOS 26? We tested the public beta on our iPhones - these features are a big deal\nApple keeps a changelog of its latest OS releases here. I wouldn't recommend running beta software on your main device, as it could contain bugs and potentially have the opposite effect of what you're trying to achieve.\n2. Dim your screen\nAnd enable auto-brightness\nYour screen brightness can really wreak havoc on your battery life. Manually lowering it by even 10-20% can give you extra time. You should also turn on Auto-Brightness, if it's not already enabled. It does exactly what you'd expect: automatically adjusts your screen's brightness based on ambient surrounding light -- to not only optimize your battery life but also provide a more comfortable viewing experience in different conditions.\nHow to dim and automate screen brightness on iPhone:\n- Swipe down from the top-right to open Control Center.\n- Drag the Brightness slider down until comfortable.\n- Go Settings > Accessibility > Display and Text Size > toggle on Auto-Brightness.\n3. Disable the iPhone's always-on display\nAnother screen adjustment to try\nThe iPhone 14 Pro and later models feature an \"Always-On Display,\" which keeps a dimmed version of your lock screen visible even when the device is locked. Reports suggest this feature can consume about 1% of your battery per hour -- adding up to roughly 24% over a full day. That's nearly a quarter of your charge. By simply turning it off, you can reclaim a significant chunk of that capacity.\nHow to disable the always-on display on iPhone:\n- Go Settings > Display and Brightness.\n- Toggle off Always On Display.\n4. Use Wi-Fi instead of cellular when possible\nCellular data, especially 5G, requires more power\nIf you've ever been in an area with low or no service, you've probably noticed your battery drops quickly. That's because your iPhone is constantly scanning to locate and connect to a cell tower\u2014and that consumes power. Plus, cellular data generally uses more energy than Wi-Fi, since it has to transmit and receive signals over long distances and maintain connections with distant towers.\nAlso: How to clear your iPhone cache (and why it makes such a big difference)\nIn short, cellular connections drain your battery. If you need to conserve power, switch to Wi-Fi -- but be cautious on public networks.\nHow to use Wi-Fi over cellular on iPhone:\n- Open Settings > Wi-Fi and toggle it on, and then join a known network.\n- In Settings > Cellular, toggle off Cellular Data.\n- In Settings > Cellular, disable Wi-Fi Assist to prevent auto-fallback to cellular.\n5. Disable 5G\nSwitch to LTE\nIf you need cellular service for whatever reason and just don't want to rely on Wi-Fi alone, at least make sure your 5G signal isn't patchy. While 5G offers faster speeds and lower latency, 4G LTE is considered more efficient in areas with weak or spotty coverage.\nHow to switch from 5G to LTE on iPhone:\n- Go Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Options.\n- Tap Voice and Data, select LTE.\n- Optional: Disable 5G Standalone under Voice and Data in Settings.\n6. Enable Low Power Mode\nExtend your battery life by reducing or disabling features\nApple offers a feature on all iPhones running iOS 9 or later called Low Power Mode. When enabled, it limits background activity like app refreshes, disables automatic downloads, lowers screen brightness, throttles the CPU, and slows down some animations. That all might sound drastic, but it can give you an extra hour or three on a low battery. Your battery icon turns yellow to indicate it's active.\nHow to enable Low Power Mode on iPhone:\n- Go Settings > Battery > toggle Low Power Mode on (battery icon turns yellow).\n- Or add to Control Center: Swipe into Control Center, hit +, search and add Low Power Mode.\n7. Use Adaptive Power Mode\nBut wait for iOS 26 to officially release\nIf you own an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max or any iPhone 16 model, you can take advantage of Apple's new Adaptive Power Mode in iOS 26. It leverages on-device AI to automatically make small performance adjustments -- like slightly lowering screen brightness or allowing some processes to take a bit longer -- to extend your battery life when needed. It's more subtle and seamless than Low Power Mode.\nAlso: Should you turn on Adaptive Power on iOS 26? Here's my advice after testing it\nKeep in mind, it's only available in the iOS 26 beta right now, so you might want to wait for the official release before trying it on your daily driver.\nHow to enable Adaptive Power Mode on iPhone:\n- Make sure you're running iOS 26.\n- Open Settings > Battery > Power Mode.\n- Select Adaptive Power Mode.\n8. Disable keyboard haptics\nDon't forget sounds too\nDid you know every little buzz or click invokes the Taptic Engine on your iPhone? Thousands of key presses throughout your day add up fast, and they all consume power. Apple even notes on a support page that haptics might affect your battery life. So if you're desperate to conserve every last drop, turn off keyboard haptics (and even the click sounds) until you're back near a charger.\nHow to disable keyboard feedback on iPhone:\n- Open Settings > Sounds and Haptics.\n- Tap Keyboard Feedback.\n- Toggle off Haptics (and Sound if desired).\n9. Turn off 'Hey Siri'\nYou probably rarely use it anyway\nApple's \"Hey Siri\" feature can contribute to battery drain because your iPhone must constantly listen for the command, and when active, it uses both the microphone and the Neural Engine. Like any task, this consumes power. If you rarely use the hot word, switch it off. You can always invoke Siri by holding the side button.\nAlso: 10 easy ways to make Siri work better on your iPhone today\nHow to disable \"Hey Siri\" on iPhone:\n- Go Settings > Siri.\n- Tap Talk to Siri > select Off.\n- Optional: Disable Allow Siri When Locked to prevent accidental wakeups.\n10. Reduce your notifications\nYour battery and your sanity will thank you\nDid you know each push notification and alert you receive throughout the day uses power? Think about it: They wake your iPhone screen, can play sounds, and often vibrate. You should disable all non-essential notifications to reduce wake cycles and save power. Besides, do you really want to be spammed all day? Get them under control and eke out a few extra percent of battery life.\nAlso: You should stop putting your phone face up on the table - here's why\nHow to manage your notifications on iPhone:\n- Open Settings, scroll to an app, tap Notifications.\n- Toggle Allow Notifications off entirely, or uncheck Lock Screen, Banners, Sounds, and Badges selectively.\n- Repeat for social media, games, news, and other high-churn apps.\n11. Limit nearby AirDrop sharing\nAnd turn off 'Bringing Devices Together'\nWhile AirDrop has a minimal impact on battery life, it still uses power. The Bringing Devices Together feature, in particular -- which lets you share contact info and other content simply by bringing two iPhones close -- continuously scans via Bluetooth LE and peer-to-peer Wi-Fi. If you don't use AirDrop often, turn receiving off or at the very least disable Bringing Devices Together to stop the background scans and reduce power drain.\nAlso: How to share files between Android and MacOS with AirDroid\nHow to limit AirDrop on iPhone:\n- Open Settings > General > AirDrop.\n- Select Receiving Off, or at least disable Bringing Devices Together.\n12. Turn off Live Activities\nDo it per app - or for all on the lock screen\nLive Activities on iPhones display ongoing, real-time information from apps directly on the lock screen or in the Dynamic Island -- contributing to battery drain. For instance, a food delivery app's Live Activity might show the time remaining until your order arrives.\nAlso: Your iPhone is getting a major upgrade - 10 best features I can't wait to try in iOS 26\nYou should disable them for apps that push constant updates you don't need, such as social networks, if you want to minimize energy consumption. You can even supress them all on the lock screen in one fell swoop.\nHow to disable live activities on iPhone:\n- To turn off in specific apps, go Settings > scroll to the app > toggle Live Activities off.\n- To suppress all on lock screen, open Settings > Face ID and Passcode > toggle Live Activities off under Allow Access When Locked.\n13. Remove lock screen widgets\nStop those background checks and refreshes\nYou can probably tell I'm getting into the nitty-gritty of iPhone functions at this point. Feel free to pick and choose what you want to disable to save battery. Another niche tip I suggest, however, is to remove your lock-screen widgets. After all, they refresh periodically and sometimes make network or GPS calls. If you don't glance at them often, removing them stops these potentially battery-draining background checks.\nHow to remove lock screen widgets:\n- Press and hold the lock screen > tap Customize.\n- Select the widget area > tap each widget's button to remove.\n14. Disable Background App Refresh\nApps will update only when you open them\nSpeaking of background refreshes, did you know apps do this, too? Background App Refresh does exactly what it sounds like: It lets apps fetch updates in the background for things like emails, social feeds, and news. Disabling it means your apps will only update when you open them, possibly extending your battery life.\nHow to disable Background App Refresh on iPhone:\n- Go Settings > General > Background App Refresh.\n- Select Off, or scroll down to disable individual apps.\n15. Limit your frame rate\nAnother screen tweak you can try\nYou probably thought I was done with display settings? Not quite -- I've got a couple more tricks. The iPhone Pro models, starting with the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, feature Apple's ProMotion technology, which shifts the refresh rate between 10Hz and 120Hz. By limiting the frame rate, you can reduce GPU load and save power.\nHow to cap frame rate on iPhone:\n- Open Settings > Accessibility > Motion.\n- Toggle Limit Frame Rate on.\n16. Use Dark Mode\nUseful for OLED iPhones\nDark Mode on iPhones can not only save your eyes but also your battery. It only does so on OLED displays, but fortunately, that's the iPhone X and all later models. OLED panels light up individual pixels, so with Dark Mode enabled, black areas of the screen consume less power, reducing energy use and extending battery life.\nHow to enable Dark Mode on iPhone:\n- Go Settings > Display and Brightness.\n- Under Appearance, tap Dark.\n- Optional: Enable Automatic and schedule it for Sunset to Sunrise.\n17. Use Optimized Charging\nSlow your battery aging\nFinally, Apple offers a feature called Optimized Battery Charging that's meant to extend your battery by minimizing the time it stays at a full charge. Using machine learning, it learns your charging habits and pauses at 80% until just before you typically unplug. In other words, it holds at 80% until you need a full 100%, reducing time spent at max voltage. This helps prevent battery wear caused by prolonged periods at a full charge.\nHow to enable Optimized Charging on iPhone:\n- Open Settings > Battery > Battery Health and Charging.\n- Toggle on Optimized Battery Charging.\n- On iPhone 15+ also enable Optimized Charge Limit to cap at 80%.\nFAQs\nWhat about Focus Modes - do they help battery life?\nYes. Focus Modes help by letting you whitelist specific apps and contacts; during \"Work\" or \"Sleep,\" only critical alerts light up your display. That means fewer wake-ups and less background processing. I already mentioned disabling notifications above, but you can take it a step further with Focus Modes.\nAlso: The best Apple deals right now: Save on MacBooks, iPhones, and more\nHow to set up a Focus Mode:\n- Open Settings > Focus > tap + to create a profile.\n- Under Allowed Notifications, choose People and Apps.\n- Optionally schedule it by time, location, or app.\nHow do I identify the biggest battery hogs on iPhone?\nTo see what might be draining your iPhone's battery, go to Settings > Battery. There, you'll see usage by app and how much time each spent on screen or in background.\nAlso: How to fix an iPhone alarm that's not going off - and why it might be happening\nCan removing my case while charging help?\nPossibly -- mainly if your device gets hot while charging. Removing the case can improve heat dissipation, which might speed up charging and protect your iPhone's battery health.\nShould I try a battery pack or a power bank?\nYes! I always travel with one. All the settings tweaks in the world won't help if you're stranded somewhere, staring at a red battery icon, far from an outlet.

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nAlmost everyone I know owns at least one power bank, and the ubiquity of these portable chargers means that you can pick up cheap units in gas stations and dollar stores. But my extensive testing suggests that these are false economy, and you're very likely buying something that at best won't last long, or at worse could even be dangerous.\nThis is why I recommend buying power banks from reputable brands. Don't worry -- I still work to keep those brands honest by extensively testing every power bank using an array of gadgets to make sure that they do what they say they do on the box. If the power bank claims water resistance, I test that, and if there a durability claim, rest assured that is also tested to a high level, too.\nWhat is the best portable charger right now?\nI've rigorously tested hundreds -- yes, literally hundreds -- of portable chargers in recent years, putting me in the perfect position to identify which ones truly deserve your hard-earned money. It takes a long time to test a power bank, testing that involves power meters to measure capacity and power output, testing durability claims in real world tests, followed by a chunk of time using the item on a day to day basis. But at the end of this, I know just how good a particular power bank is.\nAlso: Best MagSafe battery packs of 2025: Expert tested\nMy pick for the best power bank overall goes to the Anker Nano 10,000 mAh for its portability, quality construction (this power bank has been knocked about by me in a handful of countries), the fact that it has USB-C and USB-A ports which means it caters to both old and new devices. And to top it all off, it comes with a super handy built-in USB-C cable. And you get all that for $30.\nWhile the Anker Nano is my favorite, there are plenty of other options with different price points, features, and brands in mind. For example, if you're looking for a power bank with sheer power, the Cuktech P-series 25,000 mAh can give you several recharges of a smartphone or close to a full recharge of a MacBook Pro, or there's the nearly indestructible Dark Energy Poseidon Pro, which can take a hammering.\nAlso: Anker just recalled another 5 power banks - how to get a refund or free replacement\nAnd fear not, I'm testing handfuls of power banks every month from big brands, looking for the best of the best portable chargers. Right now I'm testing a a few different power banks, and there's at least one that could be making it to this list soon. For now, these are my favorites.\nThe best power banks of 2025\nWhy we like it: It's just everything that most power bank owners want from their power bank, and it really just continues to be the one I recommend to people who say they \"just want a good power bank.\".

And if you're the sort of person who forgets their cable (or you know someone who does this) then this is the power bank for them!\nWho should look elsewhere: This is a bit small for powering a tablet or laptop, and it doesn't make any claims regarding durability, so those looking for something bigger, more powerful, or more rugged should look elsewhere.\nAnker Nano 10,000 mAh tech specs: Capacity: 10,000mAh | Ports: 1 x USB-C cable, 1 x USB-C, 1 x USB-A | Max output: 30W\nWhy we like it: It's tough! Really tough! I'm planning a long trip on foot later this year in northern Spain where it'll no doubt be wet and windy, and this is the power bank that I see coming with me on that expedition.\nAccording to the manufacturer this can withstand a 50-foot drop onto concrete, a shotgun blast, 1,500 lbs of crushing force, and even the blast from 1.5 lbs of explosives. It's also IP68 rated for dust and water resistance, capable of handling submersion for 45 minutes, and temperature-tested to endure conditions ranging from 40\u00b0F to -15\u00b0F.\nI didn't have a shotgun or explosives handy, so I dropped it, threw it around, drove over it, and dropped bricks on it from a height, and it survived that abuse with nothing more than a few scratches.\nReview: Dark Energy Poseidon Pro\nWho's it for: This is the power bank for those who expect their gear to encounter the toughest conditions!\nWho should look elsewhere: Anyone who's not expecting their power bank to have to survive a 50 foot drop, being shot at, or an explosion!\nDark Energy Poseidon Pro tech specs: Capacity: 10,200mAh | Ports: 1 x USB-C, 1 x USB-A | Max output: 18W\nWhy we like it: It's thin, light, and highly portable.\nAt 120 grams and 8.8 millimeters thin, this is something that feels like it blends in with the aesthetic of the iPhone once it's snapped onto the MagSafe ring. There were plenty of times when I forgot that it was attached to my iPhone.\nThe high-strength carbon fiber is lighter than aluminum and stronger than steel, making the CarbonMag 5K a durable package. When in Marrakesh, Morocco, I dropped mine onto cobbled streets twice from about one meter, and the power bank was totally unscathed.\nReview: Sharge CarbonMag 5K\nWho's it for: The adventurers out there who want to keep their smartphone topped up throughout the day.\nWho should look elsewhere: 5,000mAh is fine for a day (or two at a push) of keeping your smartphone going, but if you have multiple devices to charge, you're going to need something with 10,000mAh or above capacity.\nSharge CarbonMag 5K tech specs: Capacity: 5,000mAh | Ports: 1 x USB-C, 15W MagSafe | Max output: 20W\nWhy we like it: The Ugreen Nexode 20,000mAh power bank is a powerhouse of functionality.

The detailed TFT display makes it ideal for users who want to monitor their power usage in real time. If you're someone who values both functionality and aesthetics, this power bank is a great choice.\nWho should look elsewhere: If you're looking for a lightweight and compact power bank, the Cuktech P-series might not be the best fit due to its large capacity and size. Additionally, users who only need a power bank for occasional smartphone charging may find this model overkill. Those on a tight budget might also want to explore more affordable options!\nCuktech P-series tech specs: Capacity: 25,000mAh | Ports: 2 x USB-C, 1 x USB-A | Max output: 210W\nWhy we like it: The Nitecore NW5000 is a power bank built for adventure, from its IPX5 water-resistance rating to the carbon fiber-clad design is not only ultra-durable but also keeps it ultralight and ultra-thin. Weighing in at just 4.23oz and measuring 0.42 inches thick, it delivers a 20W maximum output over the USB-C cable, and also features a Qi2 wireless charging pad that's good for up to 15W.\nIt is clad in carbon fiber that's stylish, fingerprint-resistant, highly durable, and resistant to corrosion and wear. The corners are nicely rounded on the unit so they don't dig into flesh, pockets, or through the delicate fabric of your backpack.\nReview: Nitecore NW5000\nWho's it for: This power bank is ideal for outdoor enthusiasts, hikers, campers, and anyone who spends extended time in environments without access to outlets. Its waterproof, rugged, and the lightweight and slim profile means it's easy to carry for days on end, making it a great choice for travelers and adventurers looking for a reliable, durable power source -- as long as they have the ability to recharge it every day or so.\nWho should look elsewhere: If you need a power bank with higher capacity for charging multiple large devices or sustaining power over several days, the NW5000's 5,000mAh capacity isn't going to be enough.\nNitecore NW5000 tech specs: Capacity: 5,000mAh | Ports: 1 x USB-C, 1 x Qi2 wireless charging, | Max output: 20W\nTop portable chargers compared\nWhich is the best power bank really depends on what you want from a power bank -- for some, portability is the main feature, for others it might be having the maximum possible output power.

I particularly like the rounded corners that won't dig through my rucksack or rainjacker. This is perfect for use when camping, hiking, or working outdoors. |\nFactors to consider when choosing a power bank\nA variety of factors impact the quality and usability of power banks. Here are some things to take into consideration before buying one:\n- Battery size: Power banks range from giving your device a single charge to several charges, and may increase in size and price accordingly. I think of anything below 7,500 mAh as a small power bank that perfect for topping up a smartphone, 7,500 to 20,000 mAh as a medium power bank good for a few recharges, and maybe an emergency top-up of a laptop, and 20,000 and above as a big power bank better suited to those wanting to charge laptops and such or who are going to be away from a power outlet for a few days.\n- Portability: Some people want giant power banks for multi-day adventures, while others want something small they can hold in their pocket or purse for daily charging or emergencies.\n- Design: Some want something stylish and sleek, while others want something more like a charging computer than a simple power bank.\n- Weight: Big power banks can really pull on your pocket or bag, so choose wisely if you intend to carry it around with you.\n- Ports: Do you want one or two or more ports? Do you need USB-A or will USB-C be fine? These are points to consider before making a purchase.\n- Passthrough: Do you want to be able to charge the power bank while it is charging other devices? I find this a handy feature when traveling because I can use the power bank as a charger for multiple devices so I only need a small wall charger.\nHow we test power banks\nI test and review a lot of power banks, and this allows me to filter through hundreds of units to find the best of the best. On top of that, I use power banks a lot when traveling or going off-grid for hiking and camping. This allows me to get real-world, hands-on experience of the product for extended periods of time. Finally, every product that I use, test, or review is thoroughly safety tested to make sure that you'll be buying a reliable, safe product.\nHere are the key factors I consider when testing power banks:\n- Capacity: I've seen plenty of companies make exaggerated claims about their power bank's capacity. I charge and discharge each power bank several times to test the rated capacity to make sure that this corresponds with the capacity stated on the box.\n- Power output: A lot of cheaper power banks might be able to hit the rated power output for short periods, but this can take a dive under heavy load or when the power bank gets warm. I test every power bank under heavy load to make sure that it can output the maximum stated output power for extended periods.\n- Safety: If the power bank overheats in use or when charging, it doesn't make this list. Plain and simple.\n- Robustness: How does the power bank stand up to regular use? Does the shell resist scratches and knocks? Are the ports high quality and durable? If it's going to make this list, it must be tough enough to put up with heavy use.\nLatest info on power banks in 2025\nWhat are the tariffs in the US?\nThe recent US tariffs on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and India aim to boost domestic manufacturing but are likely to drive up prices on consumer electronics. Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production.\nAlso: Tariff war has tech buyers wondering what's next. Here's what we know\nAccessories such as power banks are predominantly manufactured in these regions, are now subject to tariffs as high as 54% on Chinese imports and 46% on Vietnamese goods. As a result, consumers may see price increases of approximately 20% on these items.\nManufacturers are exploring options like relocating production to countries with lower tariffs, but such shifts are complex and may not provide immediate relief. In the short term, shoppers should anticipate higher costs for accessories due to these trade policies.\nRight now, it looks like some tech may be exempt from the issued tariffs, but since it's always changing and developing, we are keeping an eye on it and will update you on the latest.\nFAQs on power banks\nAre power banks and portable chargers safe?\nThis is a huge question.\nOn the whole, yes. I've tested hundreds of power banks and portable chargers from a myriad of companies, and as long as you steer clear of the cheap no-name junk that you might find in dollar stores and gas stations you should be safe.\nYou no doubt noticed I said \"should\" there. Let me explain what I mean.\nFirst, even the best power bank makers can and do suffer from manufacturing issues, and these can result in recalls. There were a few last year, and a good reason to buy your power banks from Amazon is that this company sends out emails to customers when this happens.\nAnother issue is that power banks can get damaged, and damaged power banks can be unpredictable. While modern lithium batteries have a number of built in safety features to prevent anything catastrophic from happening, sometimes things can still go wrong. One of the worst things that you can expose a power bank to is moisture, as this can cause short circuits, which in turn can cause fires.\nBut remember, there are hundreds of millions of power banks out there, and incidences are very rare. On the grand scheme of things, lithium batteries are incredibly safe.\nIs there a limit of the size of power bank I can take on an airline?\nThere is, but fear not, because it's actually quite a generous limit.\nFAA rules (and this rule is mirrored by most aviation authorities) allow you to take a power bank with a capacity up to 100Wh or 27,000mAh without declaring it. Beyond this, you must check with the airline and declare the power bank.\nNote that all power banks and anything with a lithium battery must be taken as carry and NOT put in the hold.\nCan you simultaneously use and charge a power bank?\nMost modern power banks have a feature called pass-through charging that allows you to charge it and use it to charge other devices simultaneously. This is a handy feature if you have limited number of power outlets and what to charge multiple devices -- for example, when traveling.\nHow long do power banks last?\nLithium-ion batteries -- the batteries found in most power banks -- are good for about 800 recharge cycles. This means if you used a power bank daily, and each day you ran it empty before recharging it for the next day, you'd get more than two years of life.\nIn reality, people easily get 5 years from a power bank, and normally, it's technology moving forward and making the power bank obsolete that kills it, not usage.\nHow long does charging time vary across power capacity levels?\nThe bigger the power bank's capacity, the longer it will normally take to charge. However, this depends on a lot of factors -- from whether it charges using USB-A or USB-C, to the power output of the charger doing the charging.\nOther power banks to consider\nHere are a couple of alternative power banks to consider -- all from reputable manufacturers and all offering safe, reliable charging.\nLatest Updates:\n- In the latest April update, we tested Dark Energy's Poseidon Pro rugged power bank, adding it as the perfect choice for those looking for a rugged power bank that can survive pretty much everything that Mother Nature can throw at it."

Here's how I help friends and family decide\nLike clockwork, a new iPhone has made its way through the rumor mill in August, and users are beginning to wonder if they should buy what's currently available or wait until fall to see how things play out.\nBased on past trends, there's a good chance Apple will unveil the iPhone 17 series in September. So, should you pick up an iPhone 16 from your local Apple store today or play the long game?\nAlso: Best iPhone 2025: I tested the top models and found the best options for you\nHaving tested every major smartphone release over the past several years and helped numerous family and friends overcome this exact dilemma, here's the decision tree I use that works every single time.\n1. Do you need a new phone right now?\nPretty simple, right? If you're currently using a handset that's severely damaged or defected in a way that prevents it from completing your daily tasks, then it's time to buy a new phone right now.\nI've had friends say that they'd be willing to power through another month with a heavily cracked iPhone if it meant they could just buy the next-generation model. However, that doesn't take into consideration the fact that Apple typically sells its newest iPhones weeks (if not longer) after they're officially unveiled to the public.\nAlso: You can download iOS 26 public beta right now - how to install (and which iPhones support it)\nSo, what's expected to be a month's wait time can easily become two months or more, depending on which configuration and model you buy. That's to say, if you need a new phone today, don't wait -- buy one ASAP.\n2. How much are you looking to spend?\nEvery new iPhone launch has a big unknown: pricing. So, your current (and expected) budget should also be considered as you decide which model to buy. Apple's done a commendable job stabilizing iPhone prices over the years, with the base model typically starting at $799, the Pro at $999, and the Pro Max at $1,199, so most people would assume the iPhone 17 series will cost about the same.\nBut there are a few more variables factoring into this year's iPhone launch. First, Apple is expected to release a new iPhone 17 Air (or Slim) model that features a thinner and lighter design than the standard variant. If it follows Samsung's price strategy with its ultra-thin Galaxy S25 Edge, we can be looking at an iPhone that's priced just below the Pro models.\nAlso: Should you buy a refurbished iPhone 15 from Apple? Only if these factors matter to you\nOngoing tariff and trade talks have also led market analysts to believe that Apple will raise the price of iPhones starting this September. According to Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, the iPhone 17 Air, Pro, and Pro Max may see a $50 price increase, or a 4-5% bump from last year, in order to offset the cost of new components and exports. Here's a snapshot comparison to the iPhone 16 series.\niPhone 16 prices | iPhone 17 prices (expected) | |\nStandard | $799 | $799 |\nAir/Slim | - | $949 |\nPro | $999 | $1,049 |\nPro Max | $1,199 | $1,249 |\nIf the potential price increase gives you pause, then it may make more financial sense to buy an older iPhone model like the 16 or 15, or even the new but accessible iPhone 16e (starting at $599). Apple typically reduces the price of the last-generation iPhone model by $100 when a new one is released, so there's a good chance you'll be able to buy the iPhone 16 for as low as $699 later in September -- should you choose to wait things out.\nAlso: How to clear your iPhone cache (and why you should do it before installing iOS 26 public beta)\nLastly, while carriers and retailers typically offer aggressive trade-in and buy-one-get-one deals when a new phone is released, these deals are not without their catches and fine print.\nMost \"free phone\" offers by major carriers usually come in exchange for locking into a long-term contract or upgrading to a pricier data plan. That's not to say that the deals aren't worth it; for the right customer, they can really net you a new iPhone without much extra work. Just remember to do your due diligence before agreeing to anything.\n3. Do the rumored iPhone 17 features excite you?\nWhile none of these rumored features have been confirmed or made official by Apple, they give us a glimpse of the next iPhone's potential. Here's a list of expected changes this year, pulled from industry experts, supply chain analysts, and more.\n- The iPhone 17 Air will feature the thinnest and lightest design, with a new display size, a titanium frame, and a revamped camera bar.\n- Apple will likely replace the iPhone 17 Plus with the iPhone 17 Air, as consumers have shown the least interest in the former model.\n- The iPhone 17 may adopt a smaller \"metalens\" technology that allows the Face ID sensor and Dynamic Island module to take up less space on the display. This also allows Apple to shrink the phone's bezels and increase the screen size to 6.3 inches.\n- Only the iPhone 17 Pro models will have a new scratch-resistant, antireflective display panel. Like Apple's nanotexture offerings for MacBooks and iPads, it may come at an extra cost.\n- The iPhone 17 Pro models will feature a new 48-megapixel telephoto camera that can capture at 8x optical zoom (up from 5x).\nAlso: iPhone 17 Rumors: Latest News and Leaks - CNET\nThe expected color options are:\n- iPhone 17: Black, White, Steel Gray, Green, Purple, and Light Blue\n- iPhone 17 Air: Black, White, Light Blue, and Light Gold\n- iPhone 17 Pro: Black, White, Gray, Dark Blue, and Orange\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max: Black, White, Gray, Dark Blue, and Orange\nBottom line: Buy now or wait?\nIf you need a new phone immediately and cannot wait up to two months, you should buy an iPhone 16 (or other existing model) right now. The iPhone 16's current features, including an A18 chip that can power Apple Intelligence tools, Action Button, Camera Control, and Wi-Fi 7 support, will remain relevant for years to come, so you're not missing out on much by opting for last year's model. There's also a good chance that you'll find a deal or price drop on the iPhone 16 today.\nAlso: We tested iOS 26 on the iPhone 16 Pro - these 5 features make the update worthwhile\nIf you're in less of a hurry, wait until September to see what Apple has to offer with the iPhone 17 series. Perhaps the iPhone 17 Aiir/Slim model will appeal to you more than expected, or Apple introduces a camera feature that solves one of your biggest pain points. Just be prepared for anything to happen, including a higher price across the board -- or none at all.\nWhen is the iPhone 17 event?\nApple has traditionally held its iPhone launch event on the second Tuesday of September, the week after Labor Day. If that holds true this year, we can expect the keynote to happen on September 9, with preorders and public availability soon to follow."

With so many configurations and models available today, and the various software and feature implications that come with, the journey of choosing the right model has never been longer. For years, I've tested every iPhone released, including the large-sized iPhone 16 Pro Max and the budget-oriented iPhone 16e, gathering insights on what models resonate with what type of user.\nWith iOS 26 officially out in public beta, and the iPhone 17 series expected to launch in a matter of months, the dynamics of how you decide which iPhone model to buy and how you interact with it have just changed again. Notably, the latest software version will likely not be compatible with some older iPhones, including the iPhone XR and XS. So I'd advise against buying those two models, even if they can be had for less money. Instead, I'd consider your best options below.\nWhat is the best iPhone right now?\nZDNET's mobile experts carefully test every iPhone model at release, putting them through their paces to provide you with the best advice on which model to buy and the key features to look out for when you do. Right now, our pick for the best iPhone overall is the iPhone 16 Pro Max, thanks to its vivid and slim-bezel display, extensive camera tools, including a dedicated Camera Control button, and support for Apple Intelligence features. Should you prefer a smaller, easy-to-handle form factor, consider the iPhone 16 Pro.\nFor most people, the standard iPhone 16 is your best bet if you want the latest iOS 26 features and Camera Control but don't want to spend a thousand dollars. It helps that the base iPhone models this year sport colorful finishes that are sure to appeal.\nAlso: The best phones: Expert tested\nThe best iPhones of 2025\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is the best iPhone overall due to its highly capable specifications and supersized attributes. It's the iPhone model that sets a new standard for Apple every year and continues to be a worthy competitor to Samsung's S Ultra series and Google's Pixel Pro XL.\nWhy we like it: Besides being the largest iPhone Apple currently offers, with a 6.8-inch AMOLED display, the iPhone 16 Pro Max also has the best-rated battery life of 27 hours of video playback. From our tests, we found the phone lasted much longer than the standard 16 Pro and last year's 15 Pro Max.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max looks and feels fairly similar to its predecessor, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as it's also made of titanium instead of the previous versions' stainless steel. This material choice \"makes the Pro phones about 10% lighter (than their predecessors) and is very durable,\" as ZDNET's editor-in-chief, Jason Hiner, describes it.\nThe one notable hardware change comes in the form of a Camera Control key on the right side of the device. Camera Control lets you quickly turn on the camera app, adjust color tones and other photographic settings, and capture pictures and videos. It's a useful tool that, with a bit of practice, can be essential for creative workflows.\nReview: iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max\nWho it's for: The iPhone 16 Pro Max is a flagship phone that commands a flagship price, meaning it's ideal for users who are willing to pay for the best iPhone available, whether that's directly through retailers or through carrier deals. You should buy the Pro Max version if you want the larger screen, enduring battery life, and triple-camera setup.\nWho should look elsewhere: But if you're shopping on a budget and don't mind a smaller screen, consider the $999 iPhone 16 Pro ($200 cheaper and with a 6.1-inch display). If you can live without the dedicated telephoto lens, you can even go with the $899 iPhone 16 Plus, which features a large screen and battery, but only has wide and ultrawide lenses for shooting.\niPhone 16 Pro Max specs: Processor: Apple A18 Pro Bionic | Display size: 6.8 inches with 120 Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB | Rear cameras: 48 MP wide, 48 MP ultra-wide, and 12 MP 5\u00d7 telephoto | Front camera: 12 MP | Colors: Natural Titanium, Desert Titanium, White, Black | Weight: 227 g | Starting price: $1,099\nThe iPhone 16 looks, feels, and performs like a premium phone should. It also starts at $300 less than the iPhone 16 Pro series, putting it in closer reach for most consumers\nWhy we like it: The iPhone 16 brings several premium features from the Pro models -- including the Camera Control key, Dynamic Island, and support for Apple Intelligence -- making it feel closer to a Pro than ever before.\nFrom our hands-on testing with the model, its slimmer, lighter design with curved edges offers a noticeably more comfortable grip than older iPhones, without sacrificing durability or style. Add in solid battery life, the reliable A18 Bionic chip, and a fun lineup of colors, and you've got a well-rounded device that delivers excellent value.\nReview: iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus\nWho it's for: The iPhone 16 is a great choice for anyone who wants a modern iPhone with high-end features but doesn't need -- or want to pay for -- the full Pro experience. If you care about one-handed usability, reliable performance, and a camera that can now shoot macro and spatial videos, the iPhone 16 hits the sweet spot. Opt for the standard size for compact comfort, or go with the Plus model for longer battery life and a bigger screen.\nWho should look elsewhere: If you're a power user who needs features like a telephoto lens, ProMotion (120Hz) display, or more advanced camera tools, you may still want to spring for the iPhone 16 Pro.\nLikewise, if you're coming from an iPhone 14 or newer and don't care much about spatial video or macro photography, the upgrade may feel incremental. Budget-conscious shoppers might also prefer to stick with the iPhone 16e or previous-gen models that still offer strong performance at a lower price.\niPhone 16 specs: Processor: Apple A18 Bionic | Display size: 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | Rear cameras: 48MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide | Front camera: 12MP | Colors: Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, Black | Weight: 170g | Starting price: $799\nGoing off of retail price alone, the latest iPhone 16e is the cheapest iPhone on the market right now. The $599 starting price comes with its caveats, of course, but there are still several iPhone benefits that may interest budget shoppers.\nWhy we like it: From our tests, the iPhone 16e excels in ways that are essential to most users, from the 6.1-inch OLED display that's both comfortable to hold and easy to view content, to the exceptional battery life thanks to the efficiency of the A18 processor, to the single 48MP Fusion camera that's capable of capturing vivid and detailed imagery.\nSure, you'll have to settle with some trade-offs, such as the notched display and lack of MagSafe connectors. Still, the overall experience of the iPhone 16e, which runs on iOS 18 with most Apple Intelligence features, makes it a reliable handset for hundreds less than the flagship iPhones.\nReview: Apple iPhone 16e\nWho it's for: The iPhone 16e is ideal for shoppers who want the quintessential iPhone experience -- FaceTiming in decent camera quality, iMessage texting with the latest chat features, firing up multiple apps in sequence, etc. -- but don't want to spend a grand on a phone. As ZDNET's Sabrina Ortiz said after switching over from an iPhone 16 Pro, \"I am equally impressed as I am surprised.\"\nWho should look elsewhere: The absence of MagSafe was one of our main critiques when testing the iPhone 16e, so if you're already accustomed to the popular accessory mechanic, you'll want to consider alternatives that support the feature, like the iPhone 16 and iPhone 15. The premium iPhone models also offer more flexible camera capabilities, including dedicated telephoto and/or ultrawide lenses.\niPhone SE specs: CPU: Apple A18 | Display: 6.1 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | Internal storage: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | Rear cameras: 48MP wide | Front camera: 12MP | Colors: Black, White | Weight: 167g | Starting price: $599\nWhile Apple has officially discontinued its iPhone Mini models, the iPhone 13 Mini is still your best option if you want a truly small flagship iPhone.\nWhy we like it: The iPhone 13 Mini packs formidable specs by today's standards --including the same A15 Bionic chip found in the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 14 -- into a truly pocketable design. You still get Face ID, 5G, wireless charging, and reliable dual 12MP rear cameras, all for around $250 refurbished.\nFor those who miss the days of one-handed phones without sacrificing performance, our real-world experiences with the 13 Mini have proven it to be a more ergonomic experience than any other iPhone model.\nReview: Apple iPhone 13 Mini\nWho it's for: This is the ideal phone for small phone enthusiasts, minimalists, or anyone who wants flagship-level features in a compact body. It's a great pick if you're willing to buy a refurbished one and want something slightly less outdated than the iPhone SE (2022). The iPhone 13 Mini is also a great option for users who want a spare phone for business or creative purposes.\nWho should look elsewhere: If battery life, screen size, or multitasking are high priorities, the iPhone 13 Mini will fall short. Its smaller display isn't great for media consumption, and the compact battery won't match the endurance of larger models we've tested. Anyone needing the latest features or preferring to buy new might be better off with a current-generation iPhone like the iPhone 15 or iPhone 16e, despite the trade-offs.\niPhone 13 Mini specs: Processor: Apple A15 | Display size: 5.4 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | Rear cameras: Two 12MP (wide and ultra-wide) | Front camera: 12MP | Colors: Starlight, Midnight, Red, Pink, Blue | Weight: 141g | Starting Price: $350\nWhile Apple continues to segment its iPhone line with \"Pro\" and \"Plus\" models, the regular offering, such as the now two-year-old iPhone 15, continues to be a viable option for consumers.\nWhy we like it: The iPhone 15 hits a sweet spot in Apple's lineup, offering many of the features previously reserved for Pro models -- like the Dynamic Island, USB-C charging, and a sleek, contoured design -- at a more accessible price. It's powered by the A16 Bionic chip (the same one used in the iPhone 14 Pro), making it fast and capable for everyday use, from gaming to multitasking.\nBoth the standard and Plus models are also receptive to Apple's iOS 26 update, so you'll gain access to the Liquid Glass redesign, enhanced CarPlay experience, and more. Combine that with one of the brighter Super Retina XDR displays we've measured and an improved 48MP main camera, and you get a phone that feels like a serious upgrade without the Pro price tag.\nReview: Apple iPhone 15\nWho it's for: This is the iPhone for people who want modern features, strong performance, and great cameras without splurging on a Pro model. It's ideal for everyday users who care about photography, video, and overall speed but don't necessarily need a ProMotion display or a telephoto lens.\nStarting at $699 -- or less if you shop around -- it's a smart buy for most people who want a current-generation iPhone that's built to last.\nWho should look elsewhere: Power users who want the absolute best camera setup, a 120Hz display, or advanced editing tools may still prefer the iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro. And if budget is your biggest concern, the iPhone 14 or 16e might be a better fit -- especially if you don't mind sacrificing some modern design touches. Those upgrading from an iPhone 14 may also find the leap a bit underwhelming unless features like USB-C or the 48MP camera are must-haves.\niPhone 15 specs: Processor: Apple A16 | Display size: 6.1 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | Rear cameras: 48MP wide and 12MP ultrawide | Front camera: 12MP | Colors: Blue, Pink, Yellow, Green, Black | Weight: 171g | Starting price: $699\nTop iPhone models compared\nAfter weighing out the specs and reviewer-tested experiences, the best iPhone is currently the iPhone 16 Pro Max. It's got a beautiful AMOLED display, a powerful (and future-proofed) chipset, and a reliable camera system that covers all the bases and angles. Naturally, the 16 Pro Max is also Apple's most expensive model, so if pricing is a concern, consider cheaper options like the iPhone 16e and even older models.\niPhone models compared | Base Price | Base Storage | Display | Processor | Cameras (rear) |\niPhone 16 Pro Max | $1,099 | 128GB | 6.8 inches | A18 Pro | Three |\niPhone 16 | $799 | 128GB | 6.1 inches | A18 | Two |\niPhone 15 | $699 | 128GB | 6.1 inches | A15 | Two |\niPhone 13 Mini | $480 | 128GB | 5.4 inches | A15 | Two |\niPhone 16e | $599 | 128GB | 6.1 inches | A18 | One |\nAre iPhones the best smartphone?\nThe answer depends on your needs and preferences. For example, while the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is ZDNET's current pick for best phone of 2025, it may not be the best option for you if you often rely on services like iMessage and FaceTime, which are exclusive to Apple's operating systems.\nPreviously, the gap between iPhones and Android phones was much larger due to Apple opting for a Lightning port instead of USB-C, but with the iPhone 15 models switching to the more universal port for charging and data transfer, it's become less intimidating to switch from Android to iPhone, and vice versa.\nWhich iPhone model is right for you?\nIt used to be fairly easy to choose an iPhone model as you typically opted for either the \"big\" iPhone or the \"small\" one. With four models available in the iPhone 16 series alone, you now have to dig a bit deeper to choose which is best for you. This is especially true of the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro, which feature nearly the same hardware, so check out our question above for more on this decision.\nSize is generally the first factor to consider, followed by price. Price limits will also drive the amount of internal storage you select for your iPhone.\nOne fantastic aspect of the iPhone is that all models receive software support for years and years, so it's perfectly viable to buy an older model and trust that it will work well for you for quite some time.\nChoose this iPhone... | If you want... |\nApple iPhone 16 Pro Max | The top-of-the-line iPhone experience. Buy the Pro Max if you want the largest iPhone available without any of the compromises found on other models. This variant, along with the Pro, will also support Apple's existing (and upcoming) AI features. |\nApple iPhone 16 | A reliable iPhone that now includes several Pro features. For most users, the standard iPhone 16 should be more than enough. |\nApple iPhone 16e | The iPhone 16e is the cheapest model that Apple officially sells. You'll have to settle with a smaller, MagSafe-less design, but the performance makes up for it. |\nApple iPhone 13 Mini | The only iPhone Mini that Apple makes. This is arguably the best compact smartphone money can buy, even if it's nearly three years old. |\nApple iPhone 15 | An older iPhone that can handle modern-day tasks. The iPhone 15 is still a solid smartphone if you want the Apple experience for less, and it supports USB-C. |\nFactors to consider when choosing an iPhone\nWe chose these smartphones by testing them for weeks and months, evaluating them based on real-world applications like phone calls, messaging, web browsing, and taking way too many pictures and videos.\nZDNET's mobile experts also liaise with industry colleagues and analysts who have hands-on experience with the handsets, sifting through the iPhone pile for the best of the best. Here's the breakdown of what factors we look for.\n- Display: Possibly the most overlooked feature on a smartphone, the display is what you stare at, scroll at, and interact with day in and day out. Therefore, when picking the best iPhones -- no matter the budget -- ZDNET puts an emphasis on devices with above-average panels. Ideally, a good display covers a wide color gamut, is durable, and has a high refresh rate for the smoothest visuals.\n- Performance: One of iPhones' biggest strengths is their in-house silicon, namely the A-series of Apple chipsets. Thanks to this mingling of proprietary hardware and software, we've found the latest iPhones very capable of running the daily and weekly onslaught of apps and services.\n- Camera quality: From group selfies to slow-motion videos, the best iPhones feature camera systems that are reliable and flexible to capture any shot you want. Naturally, an ample amount of storage size is also considered during the selection process.\n- Battery life: For how reliant we've become on smartphones, the top picks on this list are not only able to last you from morning to night but also support fast charging when it's time to top up.\n- Price: What you won't find on this list is a device that's not worth the money or is overcharging you for the hardware-software package you're getting.\nHow we test iPhones\nZDNET's review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every major iPhone release, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and more. Here's a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:\n- Design and ergonomics: How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.\n- Performance: Several factors affect a phone's performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, with all background tasks closed, and with as stable of a mobile connection as possible.\n- Camera quality: ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.\n- Battery life and charging: It's also important for us to evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it (wired, wireless, or both).\n- Special features: These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users, not the opposite.\n- Pricing and availability: Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.\nFor a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive phone testing methodology page.\nLatest news on iPhone\nThere are two major iPhone news stories that you should be aware of right now.\nFirst, Apple just released the public beta of iOS 26, meaning general consumers can now test the upcoming software version ahead of its September (typical) release. iOS 26 introduces key changes to how apps and interfaces are visualized, due to the new Liquid Glass design language, as well as usability enhancements across popular services like Messages, Phone, CarPlay, and Photos.\nOf course, you'll need to use a compatible iPhone model to enroll in the public beta; anything from the iPhone 11 and onward should qualify.\nThe second big news story concerns the iPhone 17 series, which is expected to launch in September in five different models: iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Plus, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone 17 Air (or Slim). Recently, X user @Skyfops shared two images of what can be assumed to be an Apple employee handling a test-development iPhone in California.\nAlso: First look at iPhone 17 Pro? Public images seemingly confirm big design and camera changes\nWhile the product in question is encased in a security cover and privacy screen protector, the unique camera module on the back suggests that the person is holding an iPhone 17 Pro, with the LiDAR sensor and flash embedded on the right side of the device.\nThe rumored horizontal camera bar, considered one of the more significant iPhone hardware changes in recent years, will be a welcome change. It suggests that Apple will give the upcoming iPhone models a noticeable upgrade in camera optics. (It also tells me that the iPhones will rock a little less when set on a table.)\nHow do I take care of my new iPhone?\nThere are several ways you can keep your iPhone clean and pristine.\n- One way is by equipping a protective case and/or screen protector. The best iPhone cases offer reliable drop and scratch protection, won't bulk up the phone, and may feature some extra utility like a kickstand or MagSafe ring. As for screen protectors, tempered glass options are your best bet to keep the display underneath free of scratches and cracks. They're relatively affordable, too, often coming in multipacks for less than $10.\n- Battery management is another key aspect of iPhone maintenance. To keep your device running for as long as possible, consider charging it between 20% to 80% battery. Overcharging the device would otherwise wear down the battery and reduce the health value (found in Settings). When your iPhone battery health is low (anything less than 75% typically is), it would be helpful to get it replaced at an Apple store or by an Apple-authorized technician.\n- As stressful as it may be to clear up space to download that software update, you absolutely should. Besides fixing any bugs on your iPhone, software updates also bring with them security patches to reduce the chances of your phone getting hacked.\nLatest information on iPhones in 2025\nWhat are the tariffs in the US?\nThe recent US tariffs on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and India aim to boost domestic manufacturing but are likely to drive up prices on consumer electronics. Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production.\nSmartphones are among the most affected by the new US tariffs, with devices imported from China and Vietnam facing steep duties that could raise retail prices by 20% or more. Brands like Apple and Google, which rely heavily on Asian manufacturing, may either pass these costs on to consumers or absorb them at the expense of profit margins.\nThe tariffs could also lead to delays in product launches or shifts in where and how phones are made, forcing companies to diversify production to countries with more favorable trade conditions.\nIs the $2,300 iPhone pricing legit?\nSome analysts have warned that companies such as Apple might pass these tariff costs onto buyers, potentially leading to significantly higher prices, with one estimate suggesting the iPhone 16 Pro Max could reach $2,300.\nAlso: Worried about a $2,300 iPhone? How US tariffs are causing tech buyers to scramble\nIn response, companies like Apple are reportedly exploring alternatives, such as increasing iPhone imports from India. Therefore, it's reasonable for consumers considering new tech purchases to potentially buy sooner to avoid these price hikes or to consider refurbished devices as a cost-saving measure.\niPhone FAQs\nWill my iPhone support iOS 26?\nThe next version of iPhone software is iOS 26, and it will be supported by the most recent models, including the iPhone 16 series, iPhone 15 series, and iPhone 14 series. Apple has confirmed that the now seven-year-old iPhone XS and XR models will not be eligible to be updated to iOS 26, as the company typically cuts off support after that time span.\nWhat is the new iPhone?\nThe newest iPhone is the iPhone 16e, which starts at $599, making it the company's most affordable handset in its storefront. For the price, you get a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display, Apple Intelligence support, an A18 chip, a single 48MP main camera on the rear, and a USB-C port for data transfer and charging.\nShould I buy the iPhone 16 or wait for the iPhone 17?\nYou should buy the iPhone 17 if...\n- You want the best camera system on an iPhone\n- You can wait until September to learn more about what's new\n- You're interested in an ultra-slim iPhone that's lighter than normal handsets\nYou should buy the iPhone 16 if...\n- You require a new phone immediately; perhaps your existing handset broke or is unusable\n- There's a great deal on the older handset at your carrier or local retailer\nWhich iPhone is better, 15 or 16?\nBetween the two latest generations of iPhones, here are the key reasons to buy one over the other:\nYou should buy the iPhone 16 if...\n- You want an iPhone that will last you for more than a day; the iPhone 16 Pro Max is great for this\n- You want access to the latest Apple Intelligence (AI) features and don't have a 15 Pro model\nYou should buy the iPhone 15 if...\n- You can find a good deal on a used, second-hand model\nLightning port vs. USB-C\nOne of the biggest upgrades when Apple launched the iPhone 15 series was the USB-C port, a faster, more powerful, and more universal charging standard than the Lightning port on previous models. There's really no argument for the Lightning port unless you still own legacy Apple accessories, like the AirPods, and would much rather stick with the one charging standard.\nAlso: Best USB-C chargers and accessories: Expert tested\nOtherwise, even if you own an iPad or MacBook, or almost any other non-Apple gadget, USB-C is more widely used and truly the one-size-fits-all option for charging and transferring data.\nWhich iPhone models support Apple's new AI features?\nApple's existing (and upcoming) AI features, branded as \"Apple Intelligence,\" are available on iPhones with at least an A17 Pro processor. That means the iPhone 16 series and 15 Pro series will support the AI tools.\nWhat storage size should I buy for my iPhone?\nIt wasn't until 2021 that Apple began selling both its non-Pro and Pro iPhones with a base storage of 128GB. The only exception here is the iPhone SE model. While not as flashy of an upgrade as larger camera sensors and 120Hz displays, this double-up of storage meant that consumers had more space than ever to store apps, photos, videos, and more.\nMaurice Klaehne, senior market research analyst at Counterpoint Research, suggests that higher storage options are generally better as they will help with the longevity of the device, and his firm has generally seen an uptick in postpaid customers opting for higher storage sizes when they can afford them. \"Currently, the 256GB option is sufficient for most people,\" Klaehne adds.\nShould I trade in my old iPhone?\nTrading in an old iPhone is one of the easiest (and safest) ways to replace an otherwise unwanted device with a new, more capable one. Most retailers, including Apple, accept trade-ins of older iPhone models, with store credit ranging from as low as $50 to $800; it all depends on which generation your iPhone is, the condition, and whether it turns on or not.\nIs the iPhone 17 out yet?\nThe iPhone 17 series is expected to launch in September 2025, with there being potentially four new models: the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. The Air model is only rumored, but features a thinner design for better portability.\nDo I really need an iPhone case?\nWhile an iPhone case is not a necessity -- your iPhone will still function normally without it -- having one on greatly reduces the chances of wear and tear. For example, the best cases are military-grade certified, meaning they'll keep your iPhone protected from waist-high drops. Not only do cases reduce the chances of your phone getting cracked or scratched, but the plastic/rubberized material often provides more grip than if you hold your iPhone naked.\nWhich iPhone should I buy for a parent?\nAt the time of writing, the iPhone 16 is the best phone to buy for a parent. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles as its Pro siblings, but the iPhone 16 model has all the essential features in 2025, from eSIM support to a reliable battery and charging experience to a display large enough for any form of content consumption. It also comes in a Plus size if you require a bigger screen size.\nFrom our testing, the cameras on the iPhone 16 are reliable enough for clear video calls, the occasional outdoor photo, and capturing images of children and pets.\nWhat is eSIM?\nEmbedded Subscriber Identity Module, or eSIM in short, is the electronic version of the classic SIM card. That means your eSIM carries your phone number, mobile data plan, and telephone carrier info, just like a regular SIM card. The major difference between eSIM and SIM is that the former does not need to be physically installed onto your phone, which is why the iPhone 14, 15, and 16 lines no longer have a dedicated slot for it. Instead, you'll have to transfer the information wirelessly via Apple's file transfer service, or with the help of your local carrier representatives.\nAlso: eSIM vs. SIM: What's the difference?\nThere is one problem that ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner sees with Apple forcing eSIM adoption on US consumers. \"There are a variety of good reasons why some people will still need or prefer a phone with a physical SIM card. The top reason is privacy. This is especially true for some journalists and populations at risk of persecution around the world. Removing the physical SIM card option reduces privacy for millions of people, especially some of the most vulnerable,\" said Hiner.\nNote that if you buy an iPhone 14, 15, or 16 anywhere outside of the U.S., the device will come with a regular SIM card slot.\nWhich iPhone models support 5G?\nAll models within the iPhone 16, 15, 14, and 13 line, as well as select iPhone 12 models, support 5G wireless technology. Even the new iPhone 16e supports Sub-6, low-band 5G networks.\n5G continues to roll out across the US, and while it is debatable if there are benefits to the speeds of the network, in my experience, the broad coverage of low-band 5G has solved my connectivity issues in spotty coverage areas with past iPhone models.\nEven more importantly, the 5G iPhone models have Qualcomm chipsets inside that are proving to provide better RF reception than we saw in past iPhones that had Intel chipsets.\nWhich iPhone models support wireless charging or MagSafe?\nAll of the iPhone models in this list support Qi wireless charging technology, which is becoming an expected feature for modern smartphones from all manufacturers.\nMeanwhile, Apple's proprietary MagSafe technology is only supported by the iPhone 16, iPhone 15, iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and iPhone 12 models. (Notably, the latest iPhone 16e does not support MagSafe.)\nAlso: Best MagSafe accessories for your iPhone\nMagSafe provides a secure magnetic connection system so that you can connect to wireless chargers with perfect positioning and alignment. MagSafe can also be used with other accessories, such as wallets and kickstands.\nWhile the extra security when your iPhone is docked to a wireless charger can be a nice bonus, it's not vital and probably shouldn't be a major determiner in your choice. Apple's first-party wallets and battery packs that use MagSafe have also received somewhat mixed reviews, making them a hard sell for all except the most die-hard Apple enthusiasts.\nHow many years do iPhones typically last?\nWhile this number varies greatly depending on how you handle a smartphone -- perhaps you're a construction worker whose phone will be put through the harshest climates or you have kids who may drop the phone ever so often -- the iPhone will typically run efficiently for three to four years.\nThen, you'll likely experience more frequent app crashes, lag, storage problems, and more. Those are common issues that any piece of technology will inhibit, not just the iPhone, after years of constant usage.\nIf you'd like to prolong that time, I'd recommend visiting your local Apple store to have the phone's battery replaced every three to four years and also consider backing up files to an external hard drive for safekeeping. As a last resort, a factory reset, followed by data restoration, should give your phone a brand-new feel.\nLatest updates\n- In our July update, we added information regarding the public beta release of iOS 26 and recent news reports surrounding the upcoming iPhone 17 series. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 has also been added as an alternative pick.\n- In our June update, we updated the software advice sections to include iOS 26, which is being released to select iPhone models.\n- In our latest April update, we tested the iPhone 16e and added it as our recommendation for best cheap iPhone, replacing the iPhone SE (2022).\n- In our January update, we added the latest information on the iPhone 16 lineup and Apple Intelligence based on four months of extensive testing.\n- In our September update, we added the iPhone 16 lineup, including the standard models, Pro, and Pro Max. They replaced the iPhone 15 generation of handsets.\nOther phone models we tested\nOutside of this list of excellent options, here are worthy alternatives that will surely delight you.\nFor an older iPhone with 90% of the 16 Pro Max's features, consider the 15 Pro Max from 2023. You can still snag one at most retailers - and for less than the newest model.\nBy opting for the iPhone 15 Pro Max instead of the 16 series, you have more to gain than to lose. For example, the device has a similar-sized OLED display that gets plenty bright when outdoors. There's also a triple camera system that, from our long-term testing. competes well with the 16 Pro Max.\nReview: iPhone 15 Pro\nPerhaps most importantly, the iPhone 15 Pro series -- whether you opt for the Max variant or not -- supports the latest iOS 26 update and Apple Intelligence features.\nIf you're budget-shopping, the Google Pixel 9a is within the $500 price range and is one of the best midrange phones on the market. Having tested it and the iPhone 16e, I'd even go as far as to say that it's the better-value handset, and one that I recommend with confidence to both iOS and Android users.\nReview: Google Pixel 9a\nWhat makes the Pixel 9a stand out? It's fairly comfortable to use, with a 6.1-inch screen that's not too big and not too small, the battery size is actually the largest of any Google Pixel model at 5,100mAh, and the software experience is among the smoothest and most user-friendly in the Android space.\nSure, the device won't feel like a million dollars. But it's the well-roundedness of the Pixel 9a that makes it such a great buy, especially in today's economic landscape.\nIt's been long rumored that Apple will launch a foldable iPhone, and the latest reports point to an end-of-2026 release date. If you can't wait to experience a modern handset that flips and folds, consider the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7. It's such a polished foldable phone that you might even consider sticking with Samsung and Android in the long term.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7\nAt $1,099, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 features an expansive 4.1-inch external display that's great for one-handed browsing and app usage, as well as a 6.9-inch internal display when unfolded. Notably, both screens refresh at 120Hz, so they feel as smooth to interact with as they are to look at.\nThe big upgrade with this year's foldable model is its thinner yet more durable form factor, making the Galaxy Z Flip 7 more portable than ever. You really have to hold it to understand its beauty, so I highly recommend visiting your local carrier or retailer if you're even slightly interested.\nFor more on getting the most out of your iPhone, check out how to clear your iPhone cache, how to download the iOS 26 public beta, and how to block cookie pop-ups online."

      "text": "If these iPhone 17 Air rumors are real, my old phone is about to be retired\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- iPhone 17 Air may debut as Apple's thinnest phone ever.\n- Single rear camera shows Apple's thinness trade-offs.\n- Expected to debut on Sept. 9, 2025, priced around $900.\nApple is rumored to be spicing things for this year's iPhone event. It could introduce an ultra-thin model for the 2025 iPhone lineup called the iPhone 17 Air. It's thought to be much slimmer than any iPhone so far -- and it will totally replace the Plus line that's been around for over a decade.\nAlso: Buy the iPhone 16 or wait for iPhone 17? Here's how to decide\nDue this September alongside the rest of the iPhone 17 family, it's been repeatedly described as a super-slim new tier, with a target price around $900. But what else makes this phone so different, and why should you care?\nLet's go rumor by rumor.\n1. It's called iPhone 17 Air so far\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman has described to the upcoming model as \"skinny\" and repeatedly calls it \"iPhone 17 Air.\" So, that's what everyone else is calling it. Apple itself hasn't confirmed the name, so consider \"Air\" a working moniker until it debuts in September.\nAlso: 5 Apple products you definitely shouldn't buy this month\nWith any pre-release reporting, details can change. But Gurman is a managing editor with a strong record on Apple scoops. AppleTrack currently rates his accuracy around 86%. This is a site that meticulously tracks, verifies, and rates the accuracy of Apple's biggest leaks and rumors. MacRumors even graded Gurman's WWDC 2025 predictions with an A+.\n2. iPhone 17 Air is really, really thin\nIf the rumors are true, the iPhone 17 Air could be the thinnest iPhone ever.\nAlso: Best iPhone 2025: I tested the top models and found the best options\nNoted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a 72% accuracy according to AppleTrack, says the phone will measure 5.5mm at its slimmest point -- but the camera bump is still alive and well. Bloomberg's Gurman said the Air is slimmer than the current models and has suggested it could be a step toward Apple's long-rumored port-free future.\nFor comparison, the iPhone 16 Pro is 8.25mm thick.\nRenders and videos from Jon Prosser's Front Page Tech point to an ultra-thin chassis as well as a \"camera bar\" stretching across the back. On one side of it sits a single rear lens, while the other houses a mic and LED flash. Prosser is being sued by Apple for allegedly leaking iOS 26 information, but his leaks align with a supposed iPhone 17 Air shell that surfaced weeks ago.\nOf course, making a phone this thin requires some engineering trade-offs. AppleTrack posted a video with dummy models suggesting some compromises, like the USB-C port being nudged closer to the back edge instead of sitting neatly in the middle.\nAs for weight, MacRumors spotted South Korean leaker yeux1122 had claimed in a blog that the Air will come in at about 145g. That would make it much lighter than the 199g iPhone 16 Pro and slightly heavier than the 141g iPhone 13 Mini.\n3. It has a 6.6-inch display\nSeveral leakers and analysts, including Ming-Chi Kuo, said the iPhone 17 Air will have around a 6.6-inch display with very slim bezels. It could have a refined front layout, but it will keep the Dynamic Island largely the same as current models. Meanwhile, Macworld recently spotted a new 1260\u00d72740 wallpaper resolution in iOS 26 betas that doesn't match any existing iPhones.\n4. Let's talk about that camera\nTo keep the iPhone 17 Air as thin as possible, Apple is expected to make some changes in the camera department.\nAlso: How to clear your iPhone cache (and why you should)\nBoth Kuo and Bloomberg's Gurman reported the iPhone 17 Air will drop both the ultrawide and telephoto lens. Instead, it's shipping with a single rear camera -- likely 48MP. Jon Prosser's renders back this up, showing just one lens inside the top camera bar.\nUp front, analyst Jeff Pu said all iPhone 17 models will feature a 24MP selfie camera. AppleTrack has Pu's record at about 50%.\n5. It might not last a full day\nA thinner iPhone means a smaller battery, right? Not so fast. Here's how Apple plans to tackle the issue of battery life:\n- Efficient charging and thermal management: Leaker Majin Bu has shared photos and measurements of what's claimed to be the Air's battery: an L-shaped, steel-cased module that's about 2.49mm thick with an estimated capacity of 2,900mAh. The prototype features welded edges, new adhesives to make replacements easier, and could allow for more efficient charging thanks to improved thermal management. Together, these details suggest Apple is optimizing internal space and battery performance.\n- High-density battery with silicon-anode cells: Kuo has floated the idea of a high-density battery for the iPhone 17 Air, while AppleInsider, citing a report from DigitTimes, claimed supplier TDK is preparing silicon-anode cells. The combination of this tech would be a major leap, essentially allowing the iPhone 17 Air to store more energy in the same space.\n- An Apple-made battery case: The Information's Wayne Ma reported that Apple's internal testing shows the Air's battery life won't quite hit the company's usual targets. He said the percentage of users who can go a single day without recharging the thin phone will be between 60% and 70%. To make up for that, Apple has been developing its own battery case.\n- Software tricks: Let's also not forget that iOS 26 introduces a new feature called Adaptive Power, which was widely discussed during and after WWDC. Apple's iOS 26 overview doesn't go into much detail, but ZDNET's Adrian Kingsley-Hughes tested it and reported that the system automatically adjusts performance and background tasks to stretch battery life when needed.\n6. Information on other specs\nIf you're wondering about which A-series chip the iPhone 17 Air will get or how much RAM it'll have, here's what's leaked so far:\n- Processor: Bloomberg's Gurman claimed the iPhone 17 Air will get the standard A19, while the iPhone 17 Pro models will get the A19 Pro chip. A counter-rumor from Fixed Focus Digital on Weibo (via MacRumors) claimed the A19 Pro is coming to the Air.\n- RAM: Kuo said to expect 12GB DRAM on at least three iPhone 17 models.\n- Wi-Fi: Kuo also said Apple's in-house Wi-Fi chip will be used across all iPhone 17 models, meaning it's moving away from Broadcom. This reporting echoes earlier coverage from Reuters outlining Apple's in-house Wi-Fi/Bluetooth transition.\n7. What about new colors?\nLeaker Majin Bu -- posting on his own site and X -- has repeatedly said the iPhone 17 Air will be available in four colors: a very light \"sky\" blue, silver, black, and a light gold. You can see these colors, as well as the other iPhone 17 models' colors, in the tweet below.\n8. How much it will cost\nBloomberg's Gurman reported that the iPhone 17 Air will be priced around $900, in line with the idea that it will replace the Plus tier.\nAlso: Apple's tariff costs and iPhone sales are soaring\nHowever, in May 2025, President Donald Trump publicly threatened a 25% tariff on iPhones not built in the US -- a move that, if enacted and applied to the Air's supply chain, could affect pricing.\n9. When to expect the Air\nApple traditionally holds its iPhone event in early to mid-September to unveil the latest models, which then go on sale within a couple of weeks. While Apple hasn't confirmed the iPhone 17 Air, its next event will take place on Sept. 9, 2025, and multiple reports, including Bloomberg's Gurman most recently, suggest the ultra-thin model will debut during this event.\nFAQs\nWhat's the quick TL;DR for iPhone 17 Air?\nHere's a quick list of all the rumors and leaks I mentioned above for the iPhone 17 Air:\n- Chassis: Ultra-thin \"Air\" design measuring 5.5mm at its slimmest point.\n- Display: ~6.6-inch panel with a ~2740\u00d71260 resolution.\n- Cameras: Single rear (wide) camera, 24MP selfie camera, and Dynamic Island largely unchanged.\n- Chip: Either A19 or A19 Pro.\n- Wireless silicon: Apple's in-house Wi-Fi will be in all iPhone 17 models.\n- Battery: Steel-cased pack around ~2,900 mAh; Apple battery case reportedly in the works.\n- Colors: Four rumored finishes (black, silver, light gold, and light blue).\n- Price: Around $900 for Air, per Bloomberg.\n- Release date: September 2025 unveil alongside the rest of the iPhone 17 family.\nAlso: Just installed iOS 18.6 on your iPhone? 11 settings to change first\nIs \"Air\" really the final name?\nBloomberg uses \"Air\" to describe the thin model replacing Plus, but Apple's official names are only confirmed on event day.\nWhy will the iPhone 17 Air have only one rear camera?\nKuo says it will, and Prosser's renders show the same. If true, Apple seems to be prioritizing thinness with the iPhone 17 Air.\nDoes Apple plan to release other iPhone models in 2025?\nYes. Multiple reports point to a four-phone lineup in September 2025: iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air (replacing the \"Plus\" models), iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max.\nWhy will iPhone 17 Air kill the Plus line?\nFor the past few years, Apple has offered four models: a standard iPhone, a slightly larger Plus model (which costs $100 more), and two iPhone Pro models (a regular Pro and a larger, more expensive Pro Max). It sounds like the iPhone 17 Air will adopt the starting price of the iPhone 16 Plus, and its screen size will be close to that model. Add it all up, and there's just no need for a Plus anymore.\nHow big is the screen compared to other models?\nKuo estimated the iPhone 17 Air's display at about 6.6 inches, which would put the Air between the standard iPhone 17 and the Pro models. Display analyst Ross Young, however, more specifically listed it at 6.55 inches in his breakdown of the lineup, as shown below. With a 92% accuracy rating from AppleTrack, his numbers are likely close to what we'll actually see.\n- iPhone 17: 6.27-inch display (up from 6.12 inches)\n- iPhone 17 Air: 6.55-inch display\n- iPhone 17 Pro: 6.27-inch display (same as iPhone 16 Pro)\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max: 6.86-inch display (no change from iPhone 16 Pro Max)"
