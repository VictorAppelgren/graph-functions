  "description": "Three women who were sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein when they were just teenagers demand accountability after what they call being \u201cre-abused\u201d by officials.",
  "content": "For many of the women victimized by Jeffrey Epstein, their lives are divided into two parts: before and after they were sexually abused by him.\n\nChange was obvious to Ashley Rubright\u2019s friends after she met Epstein. But she didn\u2019t recognize the stark difference until she looked at her school yearbooks more than a decade later.\n\n\u201cEverybody that signed my yearbooks \u2026 was like \u2018Have a great summer!\u2019 \u2018Let\u2019s chill,\u2019 \u2018It was great hanging out with you this year,\u2019\u201d recounted Rubright, describing the \u201call positive\u201d comments to CNN in an exclusive interview.\n\nFollowing her introduction to Epstein sometime after turning 15, she recounted, \u201cThe next yearbook that came out \u2026 all the comments were different: \u2018I\u2019m really worried about you,\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t do anything stupid this summer.\u2019\u201d\n\nRubright described becoming angry and moving out of her parents\u2019 home at 17. It would be years before she connected her troubles to Epstein.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Wow, that really did impact me back then.\u2019\u201d\n\nRubright has never shared her story publicly. She agreed to speak exclusively with CNN because she is \u201ctired of going through this\u201d and because many of Epstein\u2019s victims, whom she considers her \u201csoul sisters,\u201d are talking to Congress this week.\n\nChange was also obvious in Courtney Wild\u2019s life \u2014 straight A\u2019s through middle school, first chair trumpet, cheerleading captain. But in the summer before high school, as her parents struggled with addiction and eventually became homeless, Wild\u2019s life was tough. She met Epstein at the age of 14.\n\n\u201cIt was also going from one of the poorest neighborhoods in West Palm Beach, driving over the Palm Beach bridge, and it was just like a different world, and it was unbelievable.\u201d\n\nWild would sneak over to Epstein\u2019s estate, filled with confusion and guilt and shame, she said. Once inside the estate, in the massage room, in his bedroom, Wild said Epstein was grooming and controlling.\n\n\u201c(He) would \u2026 try to get on my level, and he was good at making that very weird situation not the weirdest thing until the abuse happens. The first time the abuse happened, I just remember how traumatized I was and how disgusted I felt within myself. It digs deep. You\u2019re figuring out life, who you are, and just to be used and abused, is just so painful. And then to be re-abused by the government over and over again, still in a sense to this day.\u201d\n\nWhat Wild calls the \u201cre-abuse\u201d goes back to 2007, when Epstein cut a sweetheart deal with the government to avoid federal prosecution. The deal was signed off on by then-US attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta, who became labor secretary in the first Trump term in 2017. Epstein\u2019s victims say they weren\u2019t made aware of the plea deal until after it was agreed to, despite notification being a legal requirement.\n\nAll these years later, the destruction Epstein brought to the lives of the survivors still impacts them every day. There are the strange looks when they drop their kids off at school, the story may be on the TV at the local pharmacy, or they may hear people talking about it during a family trip to Walt Disney World.\n\nSome try to avoid all the noise. Not Rubright. She\u2019s immersing herself in it, to protect herself from being caught off guard. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t focus on my life,\u201d she added, her voice catching on the emotion.\n\nRandee Kogan, a therapist who has worked with some of the survivors for decades, calls the ongoing questions and speculation \u201ca form of imprisonment\u201d for the abused girls, now women.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming with a cost. There\u2019s a lot of triggers that are coming. There are emotions that are coming up that you don\u2019t realize at the time when you\u2019re reading it, but it sparks anger, it sparks flashbacks, it sparks anxiety, and then leading to the fact that, well, \u2018I can\u2019t escape it, so I need to know it,\u2019 but it\u2019s greatly impacting everybody.\u201d\n\nKogan says it makes the trauma feel like it happened yesterday, not 20 years ago.\n\nFor Jena-Lisa Jones, who met Epstein when she was 14, having Epstein in the news is a constant reminder. He was her first sexual experience, and she says it changed her forever. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big manipulation thing when you\u2019re 14 and broke.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s still a powerful force today, she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s worlds of emotion. One day it can be like, \u2018I\u2019m super angry. I\u2019m going take them down!\u2019 You want to take out everybody, you\u2019re on this warpath. And then one day you\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m going to lay in my bed and I\u2019m going to cry forever because this is never going to go away. I\u2019m going to be 70, 80 years old and we\u2019re still not going to have answers and we\u2019re still going to be sitting here and we\u2019re still going to be talking about it.\u2019\u201d\n\nWild has shared her story so many times that she has to remind herself that it happened to her and reconnect to it.\n\n\u201cI have to remember that this was me that this happened to, this wasn\u2019t like just Courtney, you know, this is actually me,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring their meeting with lawmakers this week, Wild and Jones plan to push for better protections for victims and survivors like them, but also transparency. They want everything from Epstein\u2019s case released, with the victims\u2019 names redacted.\n\nThey fear that other survivors who have not shared their stories could be outed, or that videos of them as children being abused by Epstein, if they do exist, will be made public.\n\n\u201cIs there video footage from my own stuff that happened to me?\u201d Jones wondered during her interview with CNN.\n\nDespite their trip to Capitol Hill, they don\u2019t see why this matter has become political.\n\n\u201cThis is the one thing that all sides should be united on,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cMy biggest goal at Congress is going to be the push of \u2018We need answers and we need to protect the victims of these crimes.\u2019 Let\u2019s do something \u2026 The government let us down. So why, and why are we still waiting?\u201d\n\nThese women say it\u2019s time for anyone who looked the other way or gave Epstein a pass to answer for their actions.\n\n\u201cI feel like Alex Acosta needs to be held accountable,\u201d Wild said.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing for labor secretary, Acosta had said based on the evidence, his office decided a plea that guarantees someone goes to jail is a good thing. Epstein served 13 months in a state facility on prostitution charges, and he was allowed to leave jail to work in an office 12 hours a day, six days a week.\n\nBut Wild still has questions. \u201cLet\u2019s make the people accountable for the very high-profile positions in our government that they had,\u201d she said.\n\nNo more shame. No more excuses for how they were treated as young girls, when they needed help.\n\n\u201cI feel like there needs to just be accountability for that,\u201d Wild said. \u201cFor sure.\u201d",

      "text": "The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday released tens of thousands of Jeffrey Epstein-related files it had received from the Justice Department, as the controversy surrounding the case intensified with lawmakers\u2019 return to Washington.\nWhile more than 30,000 pages were made public, the committee\u2019s release may not represent the totality of the Epstein-related documents in the Justice Department\u2019s possession and congressional Democrats have said they largely included previously known information. Still, the files \u2013 which include flight logs, court filings, jail surveillance footage, redacted records, depositions and memos \u2013 fuel intrigue in a case that has at times driven a wedge between President Donald Trump and his own party.\n\u201cThe 33,000 pages of Epstein documents James Comer has decided to \u2018release\u2019 were already mostly public information. To the American people \u2013 don\u2019t let this fool you,\u201d Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on House Oversight Committee, said in a statement.\n\u201cAfter careful review, Oversight Democrats have found that 97% of the documents received from the Department of Justice were already public. There is no mention of any client list or anything that improves transparency or justice for victims.\u201d\nThe Republican-led House panel obtained the documents as part of a subpoena to the Justice Department last month, and the committee, in the days since, moved to redact sensitive information in them.\nAs the panel readied the files\u2019 release Tuesday, GOP Rep. Thomas Massie pushed forward with his effort to compel the publication of the case files in full \u2013 a vote that House GOP leaders have sought to head off.\nMassie\u2019s decision to officially move ahead with his bipartisan bill to force the Justice Department to release the files breathed new life into an issue that has caused headaches for the Trump administration and threatens to put Hill Republicans on the spot over the politically contentious issue.\n\u201cPeople want these files released. I mean, look, it\u2019s not the biggest issue in the country. It\u2019s taxes, jobs, the economy, those are always the big issues. But you really can\u2019t solve any of that if this place is corrupt,\u201d Massie said.\nJust hours after returning from their summer recess, GOP lawmakers were facing intense pressure from their base to make a decision on whether to support the Kentucky Republican\u2019s resolution, or risk accusations that they are against transparency around the case.\nMassie formally introduced his resolution Tuesday afternoon, kicking off a frenzied week in which he and his Democratic cosponsor, Rep. Ro Khanna, will attempt to get the 218 signatures needed to circumvent leadership and force a vote on the House floor.\nMassie expressed confidence that he and Khanna could get six Republicans to join all 212 House Democrats in supporting their petition, despite what he said were attempts by the White House to halt the effort.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a major pressure campaign from the White House right now, and also from the speaker, but I think there are enough Republicans who are listening to their constituents and care about these victims that we\u2019ll get the 218 signatures we need,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNobody\u2019s tried to get me to stop doing it. I have texted with Mike Johnson as recently as yesterday,\u201d Massie later told reporters, refusing to disclose what Johnson had said to him.\nAnd any vows from Trump and his allies to mount a primary against Massie doesn\u2019t worry him, the congressman said. \u201cI\u2019ve already poked the hornet\u2019s nest here. And you know, once you\u2019re, once you\u2019re in for a penny, you\u2019re in for a pound, we\u2019re going to get these files released,\u201d he said.\nA White House official said in response to a CNN request for comment, \u201cHelping Thomas Massie and Liberal Democrats with their attention-seeking, while the DOJ is fully supporting a more comprehensive file release effort from the Oversight Committee, would be viewed as a very hostile act to the administration.\u201d\nGOP leadership pushes symbolic vote\nUnderscoring the growing pressure on House Republicans to act on the Epstein matter, leadership on Tuesday added a symbolic vote to the chamber\u2019s calendar that would call on the Oversight Committee to continue its investigation into the Epstein files.\nMassie criticized the move, which came before he had the opportunity Tuesday to file his discharge petition and begin collecting signatures, as not \u201cwide enough.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically telling [House Oversight Chairman] James Comer to keep doing what he\u2019s doing, and I appreciate what James Comer is doing, but this vote is unnecessary, and it\u2019s to provide political cover to those Republicans who may not be sponsoring or signing the effort that Ro Khanna and I put forward,\u201d he said of Johnson\u2019s resolution.\nThe speaker brushed off Massie\u2019s criticism, telling reporters later in the afternoon that he \u201cwould not put much stock in what Thomas Massie says.\u201d\n\u201cThe House Republicans have been very consistent about maximum disclosure, maximum transparency for the Epstein files, but we have to do it in a way that would protect the innocent victims of these horrific crimes,\u201d he said, later adding, \u201cWhat people want to do with this for political purposes, to me, is really just shameful.\u201d\nIn response, Massie pointed to a Wednesday press conference he and Khanna will hold with a number of Epstein victims who he said are pleading for the files to be released.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t say that he\u2019s protecting the victims, and I\u2019m not,\u201d he said.\nEmotional closed-door meeting with victims\nJohnson and members of the Oversight Committee met with six victims for more than two hours behind closed-doors Tuesday in what many lawmakers described as an emotional and informative meeting.\nGOP Rep. Nancy Mace left the meeting in tears, while Johnson told reporters the testimonials were \u201cheartbreaking and infuriating\u201d and that \u201cthere were tears in the room. There was outrage.\u201d\nThe speaker, who has tried to walk a tightrope on the issue, vowed for \u201ctransparency\u201d in releasing information to the public, and said Trump shares the same perspective.\n\u201cThat\u2019s his mindset. And he wants the American people to have information so they can draw their own conclusions.\u201d Johnson said he\u2019d spoken with Trump \u201cabout this very subject myself,\u201d saying the president \u201cis insistent that we protect the innocent victims, and that\u2019s what this has been about.\u201d\nYet, Democratic Rep. Melanie Stansbury criticized Johnson for not wanting to expand the investigation into Epstein beyond the Oversight panel.\n\u201cIt\u2019s noteworthy that in the room with six victims of sexual violence by Jeffrey Epstein, it was suggested by Democrats that this be investigated using the full force of every committee here in Congress. And the speaker ended by saying he didn\u2019t think that was necessary. He\u2019d like to just keep it in the Oversight Committee,\u201d Stansbury said.\nMembers in the room relayed that the victims want more information released, while ensuring that certain private details are protected.\nBut even some Republicans leaving the room signaled that they would be open to signing onto Massie\u2019s effort to force a full House vote on releasing the files.\n\u201cAfter reading the entire resolution, it\u2019s very good. It\u2019s well written. It protects the victims and it provides the transparency that the country deserves, and most importantly, the survivors deserve. Yes I will be proudly signing the petition,\u201d GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said.\nFlorida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, meanwhile, told reporters she believes all of the files will be released and that a vote won\u2019t be necessary, but if it comes to it, she would be \u201chappy to\u201d sign on.\nThere was bipartisan agreement in the room to subpoena more individuals based on the names that came up in the conversation with the victims, Democratic Rep. David Min of California told reporters.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff we\u2019re learning that the government has access to that has not been made available to us,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe want to know what we don\u2019t know and where we can get it. I came away from this feeling like that first tranche of documents that we received was completely useless and that they\u2019re withholding a lot of information right now.\u201d\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\nCNN\u2019s Ellis Kim, Aaron Blake, Kit Maher and Casey Riddle contributed to this report."

      "text": "Congress is bracing for a politically bruising fall as lawmakers return to Washington on Tuesday, with massive fights upcoming on government funding, the Jeffrey Epstein files and President Donald Trump\u2019s policing push.\nAfter a summer of simmering tensions on Trump\u2019s nationwide deportations, National Guard deployment in Washington, DC, and a string of high-profile firings, Democrats are ready to fight back.\nAnd the minority party won\u2019t have to wait long for its opportunity to spar with Trump. Republicans and Democrats are already entering a high-stakes funding standoff ahead of a September 30 funding deadline, which marks Congress\u2019 first bout of bipartisan dealmaking in months. Already, Democrats are signaling they want new checks on Trump\u2019s power and a rollback of the president\u2019s signature domestic policy law, but White House officials say they\u2019re in no mood to yield to those demands and expect Democrats to help keep the government open.\nBefore Congress hits that end of September deadline, though, Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune will be navigating plenty of other partisan battles.\nOn the House side, that includes a floor fight over the Jeffrey Epstein files that is likely to rankle House Republicans right as lawmakers return this week.\nGOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and his Democratic counterpart, Rep. Ro Khanna of California, will begin collecting signatures this week for a closely watched bill that would require the Trump administration to turn over all relevant Epstein case material. And because they\u2019re using a tactic to circumvent party leaders known as a discharge petition, all they need is 218 signatures to force that bill to the floor \u2013 creating a political headache for Johnson.\nSpeaking to CNN on Friday, Johnson called the Massie-Khanna effort \u201cmoot,\u201d but he acknowledged \u201cthere may be a floor vote of one measure or another,\u201d suggesting without offering details that there could be a separate, leadership-backed resolution that could come to the floor.\nOn the Senate side, Republicans will be forced to wade into the chaos at the Centers for Disease Control, where Trump fired an official that the Senate confirmed just days before leaving for its August recess. Senators will also be pressed on the escalating drama at the Federal Reserve \u2013 which has long been seen as above politics \u2013 where ousted Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is now suing Trump for firing her.\nAt the same time, Senate GOP leaders will continue to face pressure to change their chamber\u2019s longstanding rules to speed up the confirmation process for Trump nominees, while some senators are likely to make the case to allow the president to make recess appointments \u2013 a further extension of his presidential power.\nTrump has also personally added more items to Congress\u2019 to-do list in September. He declared last week that he was working with Johnson and Thune on a major crime package that will further stoke partisan battles.\nJohnson told CNN on Friday that Republicans would first address crime in Washington, then look to other cities in America, with a focus on addressing what he called a \u201cjuvenile crime wave.\u201d And relatedly, Congress will face a vote in mid-September to extend Trump\u2019s authority to bring the National Guard in to assist with DC policing, which faces steep odds in the Senate, where it will need 60 votes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a sh*tty fall,\u201d one House member said, summing up the fights over government spending, the Epstein files and Trump\u2019s policing push.\nGovernment funding\nDemocrats were already preparing for a brawl with Trump over September\u2019s funding deadline. Then came the White House\u2019s decision to cancel nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funding \u2013 subverting Congress\u2019 power of the purse in an untested maneuver that will surely be challenged in courts.\nTop Democrats\u2019 resolve to fight Trump only strengthened after the White House\u2019s move, with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries calling it a \u201cbrazenly unlawful scam\u201d to undermine Congress and describing Trump as a \u201cwannabe king.\u201d\nIn a letter to Senate Democrats Tuesday morning, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he and Jeffries are \u201caligned on our shared priorities\u201d as Congress returns, put the onus on Republicans and the White House to work with them in a bipartisan manner to avert a shutdown and argued the GOP should \u201cstand up\u201d to the White House\u2019s push against legislative powers.\n\u201cSenate Democrats have shown firsthand that we are willing to work in a bipartisan way to keep our government open by advancing bipartisan appropriations bills. However, the Trump administration is waging an all-out war against Congress\u2019 Article I authority and the constitutional balance of power. Senate Republicans must decide: stand up for the legislative branch or enable Trump\u2019s slide toward authoritarianism,\u201d Schumer wrote.\nThe White House, however, is downplaying Democrats\u2019 threats and insisting that they will ultimately agree to keep the government open without securing any concessions from Trump.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for me to believe that they are going to oppose a clean (continuing resolution) that would cause them to be responsible for a government shutdown,\u201d a White House official said.\nEpstein files\nMassie and Khanna, the House duo that has loudly beat the drum on Epstein transparency, will hold a press conference on Wednesday that will feature people who say they were victims of the late financier and sex offender\u2019s sex trafficking ring.\n\u201cThis press conference is going to be explosive. It\u2019s the first time that a lot of these victims are speaking out publicly,\u201d Khanna told CNN on Friday.\nThe two will be working to collect the 218 signatures needed on their discharge petition to trigger a full vote on the floor, bypassing GOP leaders who do not want to hold the vote. Both Khanna and Massie have said publicly they believe all Democrats will sign on and that they will get the necessary six Republicans to reach 218.\n\u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019ll get 212 Democrats to sign this by the end of the week,\u201d Khanna told CNN, adding that he\u2019s working with Jeffries.\nBut it\u2019s not clear how many Republicans will be willing to sign on. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican who is a cosponsor of the Massie-Khanna bill, told CNN he was not willing to sign onto the discharge petition.\n\u201cI think it has lost a little bit of momentum,\u201d Van Drew told CNN when asked about the Epstein transparency push, adding: \u201cI support releasing whatever we can but not forcing by discharge.\u201d\nMassie said earlier this month that he hopes the press conference \u2013 and the fact that many victims will be addressing the public for the first time \u2013 will help convince more members of the GOP conference to vote to release the files.\n\u201cYou\u2019re virtually implicating yourself or your donors or some of your friends, if you vote against this,\u201d Massie in an interview with anti-vaccine group Children\u2019s Health Defense that was posted on its website in August.\nThe House Oversight panel this month received a spate of documents from the Department of Justice on the Epstein matter but Democrats said it contained little new information. The panel has demanded more documents from the Epstein estate that are expected to come by September 8, as well, but Khanna said he believes lawmakers aren\u2019t willing to wait for that deadline.\nOversight Committee Chair James Comer has said the panel plans to meet with Epstein victims and their attorneys on Tuesday, as they work through \u201ccomplicated\u201d issues around making more information public.\nSenate will confront recent Trump firings\nLawmakers who exercise oversight of key administration positions will return to grapple with recent dramatic shakeups, including Trump\u2019s push to fire Cook and the ousting of newly installed CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez.\nDemocrats erupted in outrage after Trump said he fired Cook, drawing questions about the constitutionality of the move that could open a new legal battle over executive authority.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, called it an \u201cauthoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act,\u201d adding that \u201cany court that follows the law will overturn it.\u201d\nWarren and other Democrats in the committee have asked the chair, Sen. Tim Scott, to postpone Thursday\u2019s planned confirmation hearing for Federal Reserve board nominee Stephen Miran as the legal drama over Cook\u2019s firing plays out.\nRepublicans have remained mostly mum on the issue, but GOP Sen. Todd Young acknowledged the unprecedented nature of the move when pressed by reporters on Capitol Hill.\n\u201cIt\u2019s breaking new ground, but I don\u2019t know whether the law allows it or not. I haven\u2019t studied that law,\u201d he said.\nSenators of both parties will likely ratchet up pressure on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after Monarez and other top CDC officials left the agency amid clashes with the administration over vaccine safety.\nGOP Sen. Bill Cassidy, a medical doctor who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said the departures would \u201crequire oversight\u201d from his panel.\nCassidy cast the pivotal vote to confirm Kennedy earlier this year after he said he received assurances that Kennedy would not dismantle federal support for vaccines.\nSen. Bernie Sanders, the ranking member on the Senate HELP panel, echoed Cassidy\u2019s call for accountability, demanding that Kennedy and Monarez testify to the committee \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\nKennedy is also expected to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday about Trump\u2019s health care agenda.\nRussia sanctions\nAs Washington awaits a potential high-stakes meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Congress could decide on its own to ratchet up pressure on the Trump administration to help end the war.\nGOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, who led the bipartisan Russia sanctions legislation that ultimately did not make it to the Senate floor this summer, implored Trump to be \u201ctough,\u201d urging him to implement further sanctions on countries that buy oil and gas from the Kremlin.\nHe said in an interview on Fox that he intends to push Senate leaders to bring up his bill, cosponsored last year by Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, that would designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism and make the country \u201cradioactive\u201d until they return the 19,000 children taken from Ukraine.\nGraham also encouraged Trump to implement further tariffs on China to \u201ctake it to the next level,\u201d arguing that Chinese President Xi Jinping could convince Putin to end the war.\nThough Graham had previously lobbied Trump to come out in support of his sanctions bill, he and other GOP lawmakers backed away from demanding a vote before the August recess when Trump threatened to sanction Russia if Putin didn\u2019t end the war quickly, though it is now unclear if or when that will happen.\nPressed on whether he has a sense of a timeline for any of the secondary sanctions he\u2019s encouraging, Graham said it was up to Trump, and that he \u201ctrust(s) his judgment.\u201d\nThune, who had floated the idea of bringing Graham\u2019s bill to the floor before recess, vowed to provide Trump with \u201cany economic leverage needed\u201d over Russia as the president met with Zelensky and other European leaders.\nThune\u2019s counterpart, Johnson, told CNN he\u2019s \u201csatisfied\u201d with Trump\u2019s efforts on Russia-Ukraine and thinks they\u2019re \u201cmoving in the right direction.\u201d Asked whether Congress should pass sanctions, Johnson said \u201cit may come to that and (he\u2019s) in favor of that.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\nCNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Arlette Saenz, Morgan Rimmer, Adam Cancryn and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report."

The women, who have recently testified before Congress, argue that the government\u2019s handling of the case amounts to a form of re\u2011abuse and call for full disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. Their testimony highlights the ongoing emotional and legal fallout from the scandal and underscores a broader push for transparency and justice for victims.",
