  "title": "Disney Stock Drops Following Revenue Miss. Time to Buy the Dip?",
  "description": "Disney seems worth a look after dipping this month.",
  "content": "\u2022 Fourth-quarter guidance seems to imply that things can keep moving in the right direction.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Walt Disney \u203a\n\nEven after reporting a quarter with great results for parks and streaming, Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) is down 4% this week. Over the last few years, Disney has underwhelmed on top-line revenue growth. Subsequently, the stock has underperformed the broader market over the last five years. The company announced a lot of news in its most recent quarterly earnings results, but it's down after reporting a miss on revenue. So, is this the time to hop into the game? I say yes.\n\nOne of the headaches for Disney has been balancing its different segments. Traditional media is struggling, whereas its streaming and films are doing well, and it just had a great quarter for parks.\n\nMost recently, streaming and parks seem to be bridging the gap created by the weakness in traditional television. In all, revenues came in at $23.65 billion for the fiscal third quarter, versus expectations of $23.73 billion. This appears to be what held the stock up after reporting strong earnings.\n\nNet income for the quarter came in at $5.26 billion, which is a stark change from the $2.62 billion that Disney reported a year ago. This breaks down to $2.92 per share. On an adjusted basis, earnings were $1.61, due to the company procuring Comcast's (NASDAQ: CMCSA) final stake in Hulu.\n\nWhile earnings tend to be the focal point of quarterly results, the big news coming out of the entertainment titan's quarterly release was actually that it would be consolidating its streaming services. Hulu will be phased out and become part of Disney+, and the company is launching a bundle service that will include ESPN+.\n\nOverall, I am encouraged by Disney's consolidation and expansion of digital offerings, because Disney makes the content necessary to do it right. When you consider competitors, so much more of their content is rented from outside sources. For instance, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) does make its own shows and films, but it also relies heavily on outside sources. Disney is much more focused on its own material.\n\nWhat's very interesting is the seeming resilience of the consumer. In an interview with CNBC, CFO Hugh Johnston noted that Walt Disney World had the biggest third quarter ever, with traffic remaining strong. This is in contrast to many concerns lately about consumer spending power. Revenue for the experiences segment of the business saw an 8% increase year over year to $9.09 billion in all. That hardly feeds the narrative that consumers are slowing down.",

      "text": "Revenue is many things. Commonly known as sales, it\u2019s the top line of the income statement as well as a key financial metric that investors use to measure the financial health of a business. Like any financial metric, there are also rules underpinning the way it\u2019s measured and recorded, and investors should be familiar with these revenue recognition principles.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is revenue?\nPut simply, revenue is a business\u2019s gross income or the amount of money it brings in from regular operations before costs are considered. In some businesses, revenue is referred to as sales, though it can also come in the form of commissions, premiums, subscriptions, and credit card fees, as well as other channels, depending on the type of business in question.\nRevenue is often used as one way of measuring the size of a business, and investors tend to look at revenue growth as a reflection of a business\u2019s growth rate. Along with profits, or net income, revenue is generally one of the two most important metrics that investors look at in the income statement.\nUnderstanding revenue\nUnderstanding revenue\nRevenue might seem like a simple concept, but the way it\u2019s recorded isn\u2019t always straightforward, and how it\u2019s recorded often depends on the type of business.\nFor some businesses, like retail, revenue is typically recorded when a sale is made, but for other businesses, like software, it\u2019s more complicated. In accrual accounting, the basis for an income statement, revenue is recorded when a service is provided, not when it\u2019s paid for. So the timing of revenue recognition can differ significantly from the timing of cash collection, depending on the type of business and how customers pay their bills. In contract-based businesses like software, customers may pay up front for some products or pay after the services have been provided.\nAccrual accounting is designed to smooth out the lumps that are common in cash-based accounting, making revenue a useful indicator of how a business is performing. However, it\u2019s a good idea to keep an eye on cash flow to make sure that revenue is being converted into cash.\nCash Flow\nHow to use it\nHow to use revenue\nRevenue is a valuable tool for investors, and there are a number of ways it plays into financial analysis. One common usage is in the price-to-sales ratio, which values a stock based on how the share price compares to revenue per share.\nFor profitable companies, investors typically prefer to use the price-to-earnings ratio, but the price-to-sales ratio can help complete the valuation picture since profit margins can vary from quarter to quarter, and profit growth relies on revenue growth. For companies in sectors like software that may not have profits, the price-to-sales ratio is especially valuable since it shows how expensive the stocks are and how they compare to others.\nRevenue growth is also a key metric for investors. In general, revenue growth is the best metric to use to assess a company\u2019s growth rate and potential. Although revenue has to ultimately translate into profits, a stock\u2019s value is closely tied to its top-line growth rate since that offers an indication of the demand for a company\u2019s products and its potential for expansion.\nHow it's calculated\nHow revenue is calculated\nAt its most basic level, revenue is calculated as price multiplied by the quantity sold. If a restaurant sold 20 hamburgers for $10, its revenue would be $200.\nFor most companies, which have multiple product lines and different businesses, calculating revenue is more complex, and the underlying concept is straightforward. Revenue is money that comes in from normal business operations. That\u2019s separate from one-time gains like stock sales, legal proceeds, or interest income for non-financial companies.\nUnderstanding revenue is a valuable tool for any investor, especially as we look forward to the next bull market. Knowing the different ways that businesses recognize revenue is helpful for analyzing individual sectors. Comparing the cash flow statement with revenue is also important to make sure businesses are converting their revenue into cash.\nFinally, looking at metrics like the price-to-sales ratio and revenue growth can help guide your investments; both of those key metrics start with revenue."
