  "description": "Frederick Richard says he'll continue to wear the \"cool\" uniform in an effort to try and get men's gymnastics to change its rules.",
  "content": "A men\u2019s U.S. gymnast is taking a big risk to make what he believes is an even bigger statement.\n\nU.S. men\u2019s gymnast Frederick Richard knowingly took a three-tenths (0.3) point reduction at the U.S. Championships on Saturday, Aug. 9, in order to wear gym shorts with compression leggings underneath instead of the classic men\u2019s gymnastic stirrups that have long been worn by competitors in the sport, according to the Associated Press .\n\nRichard, 21, told members of the media afterward that he plans to continue taking the point deduction in an effort to try and lead a massive change in the sport\u2019s uniform requirements.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 1,000% worth it,\u201d Richard told reporters, according to the AP. \u201cIf you look at these kids in the crowd, I\u2019m thinking about them and I\u2019m thinking about when I was younger.\u201d\n\nRichard, who also competes in gymnastics at the University of Michigan, took second place this weekend at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships by just .305 points, meaning the purposeful uniform deduction nearly cost him his placement on the podium. \n\nAccording to the AP, Richard \u2014 who designed his own alternative to the stirrups in collaboration with the apparel company Turn \u2014 said he\u2019s always taken issue with the pants required by rule and said he was always embarrassed about wearing them outside the gym when he was growing up.\n\n\u201cIf I left the gym to go to the gas station, I didn\u2019t want anybody to see me in my pommel horse pants,\u201d Richard said, according to the AP. \u201cKids would say, \u2018Do you do gymnastics?\u2019 I\u2019d say \u2018Yeah.\u2019 But I didn\u2019t want them to search \u2018gymnast\u2019 and see the uniform. I didn\u2019t feel like it was cool.\u201d \n\nYahoo! Sports also reported that Richard believes a uniform change can make the sport more accessible, and therefore grow the sport among the younger generation.\n\nThe Boston native said making the uniform more \u201ccool\u201d could possibly help keep kids in the sport as they grow older.\n\n Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n\"It does add to what makes a 12-year-old boy decide, 'Do I want to keep doing this sport? Or should I play football or soccer, because my friends think I\u2019m cool when I play with them?' \" Richard said, according to Yahoo. \n\n\u201c[I want them to] see this, and they\u2019re like, \u2018This is cool. I want to wear this. This kid is trying to make the sport cool, he looks cool,' \" Richard added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the stuff that gets kids into the sport, that\u2019s stuff that keeps kids in the sport.\u201d",

      "text": "Frederick Richard trades out pants, deliberately takes uniform deductions at U.S. Gymnastics Championships\nTeam USA gymnast Frederick Richard roared to a second-place finish in the men's all-around at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships on Saturday. His quest for a medal at the championships went hand-and-hand with another quest: to make men's gymnastics more cool.\nAs part of his goal to help grow the sport, Richard swapped out part of his uniform for the competition. Instead of the stirrup pants and socks typically worn during four of the men's events \u2014 parallel bars, high bar, pommel horse and rings \u2014 Richard opted for color-coordinated compression leggings and a pair of shorts with his University of Michigan uniform.\nIn order to make the swap, Richard had to deliberately take two three-tenths deductions (-0.3) on his score for both days of the competition. The 21-year-old finished the all-around standings with a score of 162.555, just ahead of bronze medalist Fuzzy Benas, who finished with 162.310 points. (If Richard had worn pants within regulation, he would have beaten Benas by .305.)\n\"It's 1,000% worth it,\" Richard said, via the Associated Press. \"If you look at these kids in the crowd, I'm thinking about them and I'm thinking about when I was younger.\"\nAsher Hong, Richard's Team USA teammate at the 2024 Paris Olympics, took first place in the all-around by a massive margin, nearly 7.5 points ahead with a 170.020 score.\nFor Richard, the -0.6 in added deductions was worth it as part of a larger goal to raise the profile of men's gymnastics in the United States. Richard, who grew up in Boston, started gymnastics at a young age, but ran into obstacles in terms of his confidence in the sport. He says the uniform was part of why.\n\"If I left the gym to go to the gas station, I didn't want anybody to see me in my pommel horse pants,\" Richard said, via the AP. \"Kids would say, 'Do you do gymnastics?' I'd say 'Yeah.' But I didn\u2019t want them to search 'gymnast' and see the uniform. I didn't feel like it was cool.\"\nThe stirrup pants \u2014 which viewers sometimes compare to \"footie pajamas\" \u2014 are designed to hold close to the leg on certain apparatuses, without excess loose fabric that can serve as a safety hazard.\nRichard's take on the uniform is one of the ways he feels the sport can modernize to bring in more interest.\nMuch of Richard's decision making is based around getting younger kids more invested in the sport at an early age, especially when kids start to pick one sport over another.\n\"It does add to what makes a 12-year-old boy decide, 'Do I want to keep doing this sport? Or should I play football or soccer, because my friends think I\u2019m cool when I play with them?'\" Richard said.\nOn the first day of the competition, Richard wore maize-and-blue zebra strip pants with dark blue shorts; on the second day, he wore striped gray leggings with dark gray shorts.\n\"[I want them to] see this, and they're like, 'This is cool. I want to wear this. This kid is trying to make the sport cool, he looks cool,'\" Richard said. \"And that's the stuff that gets kids into the sport, that's stuff that keeps kids in the sport.\""

      "text": "Frederick Richard is taking his fight to make gymnastics \u2018cool\u2019 to a new front: His uniform\nFrederick Richard is taking his fight to make gymnastics \u2018cool\u2019 to a new front: His uniform\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Frederick Richard is taking the fight to make men\u2019s gymnastics matter to a new front: his wardrobe.\nThe charismatic 21-year-old Olympic bronze medalist switched out the stirrup pants that have long been a staple of the men\u2019s uniform for shorts with compression leggings at the U.S. Championships this weekend, firm in his belief that the three-tenths (0.3) deduction he receives every day of competition that he breaks the rules is worth it if it makes his sport more accessible.\nEven when those tenths add up. Richard edged Fuzzy Benas by less than a quarter of a point for second place behind two-time national champion Asher Hong. If Richard had worn the traditional uniform, his margin over Benas could have been a little more comfortable.\nYet asked if the statement he is trying to make \u2014 that it\u2019s time for men\u2019s gymnastics to modernize its uniforms \u2014 is worth the risk to his potential placement during a given meet, he didn\u2019t hesitate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s 1,000% worth it,\u201d Richard said. \u201cIf you look at these kids in the crowd, I\u2019m thinking about them and I\u2019m thinking about when I was younger.\u201d\nFinding an alternative\nWhile Richard quickly fell in love with gymnastics as a kid growing up in the Boston area, the stirrup pants worn by the guys on pommel horse, still rings, parallel bars, and high bar were another matter.\n\u201cIf I left the gym to go to the gas station, I didn\u2019t want anybody to see me in my pommel horse pants,\u201d Richard said. \u201cKids would say, \u2018Do you do gymnastics?\u2019 I\u2019d say \u2018Yeah.\u2019 But I didn\u2019t want them to search \u2018gymnast\u2019 and see the uniform. I didn\u2019t feel like it was cool.\u201d\nHis solution was to design an alternative. With the help of the apparel company Turn, Richard debuted the look earlier this year and \u201crefined\u201d it ahead of nationals.\nDuring the opening night of competition on Thursday, the rising Michigan junior wore maize-and-blue colored zebra-patterned leggings with (almost) matching blue shorts. On Saturday, Richard swapped the maize and blue for gray.\nBoth times, there was a \u201cND -0.3\u201d next to Richard\u2019s score on the first event in which the traditional pants were required. Yet Richard wasn\u2019t as focused on the ribbon board where his score was posted, but on the young boys in the stands below them.\n\u201c(I want them to) see this, and they\u2019re like, \u2018This is cool. I want to wear this. This kid is trying to make the sport cool, he looks cool,\u2019\u201d Richard said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the stuff that gets kids into the sport, that\u2019s stuff that keeps kids in the sport.\u201d\nEven if it\u2019s a largely American conversation.\nFighting for relevance\nWhile the popularity of men\u2019s gymnastics in the U.S. has declined for decades (though there is optimism that the bronze medal Richard and his teammates captured at the 2024 Olympics could help stem the tide), there are no such issues overseas.\nThey\u2019re not talking about stirrup pants in China. Or Japan. Or Russia. Places with dominant programs whose stars become champions and national heroes in the process.\nThe challenges men\u2019s gymnastics faces in the U.S. are many. The number of Division I programs that offer it as a scholarship sport is a fraction of what it was decades ago. And the impact of the recent House settlement could make opportunities at a level that has long served as a feeder system to the U.S. national team even scarcer.\nAt the Olympic level, the men have long competed in the shadow of the star-studded (and highly successful) women\u2019s program.\nRichard has long understood this. He\u2019s seen the attrition firsthand. While the uniform didn\u2019t stop him from pressing on, he believes he might be the exception, not the rule.\nCountless young boys dabble in multiple sports growing up, gymnastics included. Richard thinks tweaking the uniform requirements into something he considers more modern could remove what he thinks might be a roadblock to sticking with it for some.\n\u201cIt does add to what makes a 12-year-old boy decide, \u2019Do I want to keep doing this sport? Or should I play football or soccer, because my friends think I\u2019m cool when I play with them?\u201d he said.\nThe rules do allow for a little latitude. Some German female gymnasts opted for full-body unitards at each of the last two Olympics, though the design does not run afoul of FIG regulations.\nWhat Richard is doing does.\nPushing the limits\nAnd while he stressed he would never wear his outlawed uniform in a team competition \u2014 he wore regulation pants while helping lead Michigan to the NCAA championship this spring \u2014 that might not be the case the next time he competes internationally.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about the world stage,\u201d Richard said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to talk and see what they allow, but I want to keep pushing it. I\u2019m having fun. I feel more free.\u201d\nHe\u2019ll have some time to think about it. When the six-man roster for the 2025 World Championships was announced late Saturday night, Richard\u2019s name wasn\u2019t on it. The decision had nothing to do with Richard\u2019s uniform but the uniqueness of this year\u2019s world meet, which does not include a team event and is largely designed for event specialists.\nAt his best, Richard is one of the top all-arounders on the planet. Yet even he admitted he was at about \u201c80%\u201d at nationals following a whirlwind stretch that included traveling to places like Uganda. Richard is partnering with the African nation to open a facility for boys there interested in acrobatics.\nThe joy he felt during the trip was palpable. So has the criticism he\u2019s received back home for his uniform choice, with some telling him if he wants to look like a basketball player, maybe he should go play basketball.\nWhile Richard\u2019s modified look wouldn\u2019t look out of place on the court, pommel horse specialist Stephen Nedoroscik \u2014 who won a pair of bronze medals in Paris and became a breakout star in the process (all while wearing stirrup pants) last summer \u2014 agrees with his Olympic teammate that there \u201cshould be a certain level of flexibility\u201d when it comes to uniforms, though he also pointed out that having everyone wear identical outfits is designed to help the judges do their jobs.\n\u201cSo like, you can\u2019t wear like super baggy clothes, obviously,\u201d Nedoroscik said. \u201cBut I do like there should be maybe a little bit of wiggle room.\u201d\nThat\u2019s all Richard says he is asking for, though it seems highly unlikely the FIG would eliminate the deduction for a uniform violation anytime soon. That is not going to stop Richard from pressing on.\n\u201cI\u2019ll wear it for the next 10 years if I have to,\u201d he said. \u201cSo eventually, if I keep succeeding and winning, and eventually on the international stage do the same thing and keep winning, (the FIG) will see how people like it (and) the younger kids will start wearing it ... and the trend is going to grow.\u201d\n___\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports"
