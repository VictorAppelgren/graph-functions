      "feedback": "The draft attempts to synthesize is smart but falls short of world-class standards for a 0–3 week horizon: the causal chain is only loosely stitched, key near‑term catalysts are under‑specified, and several asserted links rely on snapshots from scattered outlets without a tight, source‑consistent thread. Actionable edits to elevate quality:\n\n- Fix and align citations: remove the erroneous D4 tag and attach every claim to an IDs-only citation from the SOURCE MATERIAL (e.g., anchor Powell’s rate‑cut possibility and Nvidia as a tech AI bellwether to 17F49LURJ; tether tariff/policy spillovers to 17F49LURJ and 218AGGUXB; bind the Intel stake and the WSJ framing to LLN6N4H3Z and 218AGGUXB; place the White House “Trump Effect” investment list squarely to 218AGGUXB Source 3; include HeartSciences and Pacaso specifics to QWWRYUZYR and LLN6N4H3Z as appropriate). This avoids non-existent citations and forces precise sourcing after every factual item.\n\n- Sharpen horizon and structure to true 0–3 weeks: segment into (a) immediate drivers (policy/news/policy surprises, e.g., tariff pass‑through, Intel stake, appliance rules), (b) near‑term catalysts (Nvidia earnings, August jobs, CPI/PCE prints, Fed commentary), (c) positioning dynamics (risk-on vs risk-off tilt, sector leadership, global risk links). Explicitly state the near‑term reaction function: if Nvidia prints strong and Fed cut odds stay at ~85% for Sep, risk assets tend to extend gains; if Nvidia disappoints or tariff pass‑through accelerates, rotate toward defensives and lower beta.\n\n- Build a tight, first‑principles narrative: connect fundamentals to price signals with crisp causality. For tariffs and inflation: explain pass‑through risk to discretionary spending and retailers; for AI productivity: quantify the plausible disinflationary impulse as a pace of 0.5–1.0 percentage point faster core inflation normalization if AI-led productivity upgrades materialize; for the “Trump Effect”: treat the investment list as a supply‑side impulse that may bolster capex and U.S. capacity, but separate announced commitments from realized expenditure. Ground assertions in the numbers at hand (e.g., 8.7B Intel stake price; $13k–$14k AC install costs; 85% Fed cut odds) and explain their implications for rates, growth, and inflation.\n\n- Enumerate concrete catalysts, triggers, and invalidation: paste a clear catalyst map (Nvidia earnings, August jobs, CPI, Fed commentary; Intel stake reaction; energy/air‑conditioning cost shifts; major tariff announcements). Define invalidation rules: e.g., if Nvidia misses by a material margin or if FedWatch odds fall back below e.g., 60–70%, reprice risk assets; if the White House Intel deal spawns durable chip‑policy backlash, reassess semis risk premia; if appliance regulation rebound offsets AI productivity gains, temper the disinflation narrative.\n\n- Quantify with precision and integrate conflicting signals: avoid bland statements; where Krugman’s stagflation view clashes with the AI‑driven investment boom, present a probability‑weighted base case (e.g., base 0–3 weeks: 60% AI‑growth impulse kept inflation in check vs 40% stagflation risk), and show how the range of investments (Apple, Nvidia, TSMC, Micron, IBM, etc.) could alter capex, capacity, and pricing power. Also note conflicts such as WSJ’s statism critique of Intel’s stake as a potential risk premium in semis; reconcile by presenting two plausible outcome paths and the price signals that would confirm each.\n\n- Increase coverage and reconciliation across all critical sources: ensure the White House investment list (TRUMP EFFECT) is used to illustrate the supply‑side impulse (cite 218AGGUXB Source 3), the Krugman interview framing stagflation risk (cite 218AGGUXB Source 1/2), Nvidia/AI focal point and Fed expectations (17F49LURJ), tariff pass‑through and retailer earnings (17F49LURJ), energy‑regulation cost dynamics (LLN6N4H3Z), high‑yield dividend/startup‑style plays (QWWRYUZYR), and auto‑financing/negative equity risks (CDBMWIUTB). Where sources disagree (e.g., inflation timing vs productivity gains), present explicit ranges and attach the corresponding source‑backed rationale.\n\n- Deliver a tight actionable outline for the rewrite: (1) a one‑paragraph executive snapshot that states the 0–3 week thesis with two competing regimes and the price signals to watch, (2) a bullet‑style catalysts table with dates/data points (Nvidia earnings date, August payrolls, CPI release, Fed speeches) and the market reaction logic, (3) a concise invalidation rule list and what to monitor next (Nvidia print, Fed cut odds, Intel stance feedback, tariff chatter, European Ukraine signal), and (4) a quantified threshold section: 85% Sep rate‑cut odds; AC cost delta ~$1,500 per unit; potential GDP/productivity channels from AI might shave 0.2–0.5% off inflation in a best case.\n\nIf you execute these edits, the piece will meet the SECTION FOCUS with actionable, source‑backed, numbers‑driven near‑term guidance, clean causal links, and a defensible, conflict‑aware view of the 0–3 week horizon.",
