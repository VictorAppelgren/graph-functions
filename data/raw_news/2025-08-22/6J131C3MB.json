  "title": "How AI Search Is Reshaping B2B Marketing",
  "description": "In the age of AI search, content doesn\u2019t just inform buyers; it teaches the machines that inform buyers.",
  "content": "Ask any B2B buyer how they research vendors today, and their process will likely sound very different from what it did even a year ago.\n\nInstead of heading straight to search engines or downloading content, buyers are now turning to AI for vendor comparisons, using Perplexity to summarize options or relying on Google\u2019s AI Overviews for recommendations. Your next customer may have already \u201cspoken\u201d to an AI agent about your brand before they\u2019ve ever spoken to you.\n\nThis shift means traditional SEO tactics are no longer enough. A brand\u2019s AI search visibility has become a new strategic KPI, and it\u2019s being shaped not just by their website but by their presence across social platforms like Reddit, LinkedIn, YouTube and beyond.\n\nToday\u2019s AI tools are trained to gather data from across the public web. They synthesize everything from structured websites to social conversations to generate contextual, \u201chuman-like\u201d answers.\n\nAnd they\u2019re not treating all content sources equally.\n\nAccording to a recent Profound study, LinkedIn accounts for 13% of citations in Google AI Overviews and 5.3% in Perplexity, making it one of the top\u2011ranked professional platforms cited by AI. By comparison, Reddit leads with 21% in Google AI Overviews and 46.7% in Perplexity, but LinkedIn\u2019s presence is particularly impactful in B2B contexts. For brands targeting decision makers, optimizing for LinkedIn is critical for AI visibility.\n\nTherefore, if a brand is active and visible in the places AI utilizes for insights, it\u2019s likely to appear in the AI-generated summaries that are now guiding buyer decisions. If not, the brand is simply not part of the conversation.\n\nFor B2B brands, it\u2019s no longer about optimizing for a featured snippet or climbing the organic ranks. It\u2019s about feeding the AI ecosystem with the kind of content it wants, and that means being present, active and relevant on social-first platforms.\n\nThis process is already underway at Reddit, for instance, which now licenses its data to AI companies for tens of millions of dollars annually. That means content, whether it\u2019s a product walkthrough on YouTube or a leadership post on LinkedIn, can and will be included in the datasets AI tools rely on to form answers to business-critical questions.\n\nAnd in a world where AI overviews are replacing search results, brand visibility in those answers is just as crucial as a Google ranking.\n\nThe Risks Of Being AI-Invisible\n\nTraditional SEO KPIs, such as click-through rate, rank position and uploading content to the schema markup, are still useful, but they don\u2019t tell you how a brand is performing in AI search.\n\nThe danger is this: A brand could be ranked first place on Google and still lose a deal because AI never mentioned it.\n\nAI search results don\u2019t work like traditional snippets. Instead of linking to a single source, they aggregate perspectives, prioritize community consensus and lean into human language\u2014something that platforms like Reddit and LinkedIn excel at.\n\nThe content that LLMs trust is no longer what's optimized for SEO. It's what's human, authentic and shared. For B2B marketers, that means letting go of the idea that SEO is about website structure. It\u2019s about strategic content distribution on the platforms where AI builds its knowledge base.\n\nSo, what should B2B marketers do? There are practical steps brands can take to achieve AI visibility in their content. Some examples are:\n\n1. Prioritize LinkedIn for thought leadership. AI models heavily reference LinkedIn for professional credibility. Ensure that your team, especially subject matter experts and executives, consistently posts insights, data and opinions.\n\n2. Get involved on Reddit. Reddit is AI gold. Join relevant subreddits (e.g., r/marketing, r/sysadmin, r/dataengineering) and participate authentically. Consider AMAs or sharing product experiences that solve real problems.\n\n3. Use YouTube for explainers and testimonials. Google's AI tools are increasingly citing video content, particularly how-to guides, customer stories and demos. A content format that is transcribable, trustworthy and accessible is essential and is being incorporated into AI platforms.\n\n4. Elevate company blogs. Blog content is still vital, especially when it is well-structured and internally linked. However, it\u2019s most effective when paired with visibility on social media platforms.\n\nWhat does this mean for B2B marketers?\n\nIn the age of AI search, content doesn\u2019t just inform buyers; it teaches the machines that inform buyers. If a brand isn\u2019t part of that learning process, it\u2019s ceding ground to competitors who are.\n\nAI search has become the new front door to brands. And like any front door, brands should be the ones welcoming the next customer in, not watching them walk straight to a competitor.\n\nThe B2B brands that succeed next won\u2019t be those with strong websites. They\u2019ll be the ones with strong, social visibility, the kind that educates, influences and appears where AI looks for answers.\n\nis an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.",

      "text": "New research reveals drastically different citation patterns between major AI platforms. Understand how ChatGPT, Google AI, and Perplexity source their information differently and what it means for AI visibility.\nOur analysis across ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, and Perplexity from August 2024 to June 2025 uncovers distinct patterns in how each platform sources information.\n[Updated August 2025]\nThis analysis presents two different types of data with respect to citation patterns:\n- Overall Citation Volume: Percentage of total citations across our entire dataset\n- Top Source Share: Relative share within each platform's top 10 most-cited sources\nOverall Citation Volume Analysis\nThis section presents the percentage of total citations each source receives across our dataset of 680 million citations. These numbers represent the overall market share of AI platform citations within our tracked dataset.\nChatGPT Overall Citation Percentages\nTable: ChatGPT Overall Citation Volume (Aug 2024 \u2013 June 2025)\nGoogle AI Overviews Overall Citation Percentages\nTable: Google AI Overviews Overall Citation Volume (Aug 2024 \u2013 June 2025)\nPerplexity Overall Citation Percentages\nTable: Perplexity Overall Citation Volume (Aug 2024 \u2013 June 2025)\nTop Source Share Analysis\nThe following analysis examines the relative share of citations within each platform's top 10 most-cited sources. These percentages do not represent overall citation volume, but rather how citations are distributed among the leading sources for each platform.\nChatGPT: Top Source Share Distribution\nWithin ChatGPT's top 10 most-cited sources, Wikipedia accounts for nearly half (47.9%) of citations among these leading sources. This distribution shows the relative concentration among top performers:\nTable: ChatGPT: Top 10 Cited Sources by Share of Top 10 (Aug 2024 \u2013 June 2025)\nGoogle AI Overviews: Top Source Share Distribution\nAmong Google AI Overviews' top 10 sources, there's a more balanced distribution across platforms:\nTable: Google AI Overviews: Top 10 Cited Sources by Share of Top 10 (Aug 2024 \u2013 June 2025)\nPerplexity: Top Source Share Distribution\nAmong Perplexity's top 10 sources, there's a unique concentration in community platforms:\nTable: Perplexity: Top 10 Cited Sources by Share of Top 10 (Aug 2024 \u2013 June 2025)\nKey Findings from Top Cited Domains\nThe combination of overall citation volume and top source share analysis reveals fundamental differences in how AI platforms approach information sourcing:\nCritical Insights:\n-\nWikipedia's Authority in AI: Wikipedia serves as ChatGPT's most cited source at 7.8% of total citations, demonstrating the platform's preference for encyclopedic, factual content over social discourse.\n-\nReddit's Universal Appeal: Reddit emerges as the leading source for both Google AI Overviews (2.2%) and Perplexity (6.6%).\n-\nDistinct Platform Philosophies:\n- ChatGPT favors authoritative knowledge bases and established media\n- Perplexity prioritizes community discussions and peer-to-peer information\n- Google AI Overviews balances professional content with social platforms\n-\nSource Concentration Patterns: Each platform demonstrates clear preferences - ChatGPT's Wikipedia dominance, Perplexity's Reddit concentration, and Google AI Overviews' more distributed approach across multiple source types.\nStrategic Implications for AI Visibility\n1. Platform-Specific Strategy Required\n- Each AI platform requires a different approach to content optimization\n- Wikipedia dominance in ChatGPT requires different tactics than Reddit-heavy platforms\n2. Content Distribution Strategy\n- Diversify content across platforms based on AI platform preferences\n- Focus on high-quality contributions to key platforms like Reddit and Wikipedia\n3. Community Engagement\n- Active participation in Reddit communities is crucial for visibility\n- Professional network engagement (LinkedIn) matters more for Google AI Overviews\nTLD Citation Patterns\nAnalyzing citations by Top Level Domain (TLD) reveals interesting patterns in how AI platforms source information across different types of websites:\nTable: ChatGPT Citations by Top Level Domain (TLD)\nKey Insights\n- Commercial (.com) domains dominate with over 80% of citations\n- Non-profit (.org) sites are the second most cited at 11.29%\n- Country-specific domains (.uk, .au, .br, .ca) collectively represent about 3.5% of citations\n- Tech-focused TLDs (.io, .ai) show notable presence despite being newer domains\nConclusion\nThe comprehensive analysis of both overall citation volume and top source share patterns reveals several key insights for AI visibility optimization:\n-\nMulti-Dimensional Strategy: Success requires understanding both the absolute citation volume each platform generates and how citations are concentrated among top sources within each platform. These two perspectives provide complementary insights for strategic planning.\n-\nPlatform-Specific Approaches: Each AI platform demonstrates unique characteristics in both overall citation patterns and top source distributions. From ChatGPT's Wikipedia concentration among top sources to varying overall volume patterns, brands must tailor approaches based on platform-specific behaviors.\n-\nDomain Authority Across Contexts: With .com domains representing over 80% of citations and .org sites being the second most cited, authoritative domain presence remains crucial. However, newer TLDs like .ai show growing traction, suggesting emerging opportunities for tech-focused brands.\n-\nGeographic and Source Diversity: The presence of various country-specific domains (.uk, .au, .br, .ca) in citations indicates global AI information sourcing, while platform-specific source preferences highlight the importance of diversified content strategies.\nA one-size-fits-all approach to AI visibility cannot succeed given these complex, multi-layered differences in citation patterns. Success requires a nuanced strategy that considers overall market dynamics, platform-specific preferences, source concentration effects, and domain authority across different contexts.\nWant to understand and improve your brand's AI visibility?

But as the site celebrates its 20th anniversary this week, the company is increasingly thinking about how it can augment that human work with AI.\nReddit turns 20, and it\u2019s going big on AI\nThe go-to platform for answers from humans is thinking a lot about AI.\nThe go-to platform for answers from humans is thinking a lot about AI.\nThe initial rollout of AI tools, like Reddit Answers, is \u201cgoing really well,\u201d CTO Chris Slowe tells The Verge. At a time when Google and its AI tools are going to Reddit for human answers, Reddit is going to its own human answers to power AI features, hoping they\u2019re the key to letting people unlock useful information from its huge trove of posts and communities.\nReddit Answers is the first big user-facing piece of the company\u2019s AI push. Like other AI search tools, Reddit Answers will show an AI-generated summary to a query. But Reddit Answers also very prominently links to where the content came from \u2014 and as a user, you also know that the link will point you to another place on Reddit instead of some SEO-driven garbage. It also helps that the citations feel much more prominent than on tools like Google\u2019s AI Mode \u2014 a tool that news publishers have criticized as \u201ctheft.\u201d\n\u201cIf you just want the short summary, it\u2019s there,\u201d Slowe says. \u201cIf you want to delve deeper, it\u2019s an easier way to get into it.\u201d\nIn order for those AI answers to be useful, they need to continue to be based on real human responses. Reddit now has to be on the lookout for AI-generated comments and posts infiltrating its site. It\u2019s an important thing for the platform to stay on top of, says Slowe: Reddit\u2019s key benefit is that you can trust that a lot of what\u2019s written on it is written by humans, and AI spam could erode that. \u201cTrust is an essential component of the way Reddit works,\u201d Slowe says. The platform is using AI and LLMs to help with moderation and user safety, too.\nThe other half of Reddit\u2019s AI equation is selling its own data, which is extremely valuable to AI giants. The changes that forced notable apps to shut down and spurred widespread user protests (which Slowe referred to as \u201csome unpleasantness that happened about two years ago\u201d) were positioned by CEO Steve Huffman as more of a way to get AI companies to pony up. And two of the biggest companies have already done so, as Reddit has cut AI deals with both Google and OpenAI. But Reddit also has to be on the lookout for improper use of its data, with the most recent crackdown being its lawsuit against Anthropic.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we aren\u2019t a charity,\u201d Slowe says. Reddit wants to provide a service that people can use for free, \u201cbut don\u2019t build your business on our back and expect us not to try and defend ourselves.\u201d\nStill, with new AI-powered search products from Google, OpenAI, and others on the rise, Reddit risks getting buried by AI summaries. And Reddit is experimenting with AI-powered searches on its own platform. So what\u2019s the company\u2019s goal for the future?\n\u201cKeep allowing Reddit to be Reddit,\u201d Slowe says. \u201cI think that the underlying model for Reddit hasn\u2019t really drastically changed since the early days.\u201d The platform doesn\u2019t require real names (your username is a \u201ccoveted thing\u201d that many people keep private, Slowe says), everything is focused on text, and reputation is more important than who you are; all of these elements marked \u201ca drastic difference with the rest of social media.\u201d\nReddit is also facing competition from a slightly different angle: Digg, which is making a return with the backing of founder Kevin Rose and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. Slowe didn\u2019t have much to say about it, though. \u201cI always love seeing innovation and I always love seeing new bends on old business models.\u201d\nMost Popular\n- Google says the quiet part out loud: IP68 protection doesn\u2019t last\n- Gemini for Home is Google\u2019s biggest smart home play in years\n- How Google\u2019s new Pixel 10 compares to the last-gen Pixel 9\n- The best new features of the Pixel 10 lineup\n- The Made by Google event felt like being sucked into an episode of Wandavision"
