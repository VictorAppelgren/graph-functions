  "content": "Age verification laws in the U.K. are tanking traffic for sites that comply, and boosting the ones that don't.\n\nNew online age verification laws in the U.K. are having some unintended consequences. The rules, which require users to upload photo IDs or selfies to access certain websites, seem to be backfiring in some cases.\n\nA new analysis by The Washington Post found that porn sites that are complying with the rules are losing traffic, while those ignoring the law are being rewarded with a boost in visitors.\n\nThe analysis comes just a month after the U.K. began enforcing the Online Safety Act, which puts new legal pressure on platforms, including search engines and social media sites, to shield users from harmful content. Lawmakers pitched it as a way to keep children away from porn and other \u201charmful\u201d material tied to self-harm, suicide, and eating disorders.\n\nBut the data suggests the opposite might be happening. Porn sites that skipped the new ID checks have seen their audiences grow, while the ones that followed the rules are losing users. Some of these sites have tripled their audiences in August compared to last year, according to the Post.\n\nOne of the law\u2019s main provisions requires porn platforms and other sites with user-uploaded content to use tech that verifies or estimates a user\u2019s age. In practice, that usually means forcing people to upload a government-issued ID or a selfie to prove they\u2019re old enough to access certain content.\n\nUsers are already finding ways around the digital checkpoints. Some crafty U.K. gamers discovered they could trick verification systems on Reddit and Discord using Death Stranding\u2019s photo mode. Most are just firing up a VPN, which masks their location and makes it look like they\u2019re browsing from outside the U.K.\n\nOr, even more simply, they\u2019re flocking to sites that never bothered with age verification in the first place.\n\nTo see how the law has been playing out, the Post looked at U.K. traffic estimates over the past year for 90 of the biggest porn sites, using data from the analytics firm Similarweb. Reporters then fired up a VPN to mimic a U.K. user and check which sites actually asked for age verification.\n\nThey found that 14 of the 90 sites skipped the age check entirely, and every single one of them saw a major traffic surge. One site doubled its U.K. visitors since last August, hitting more than 350,000 visits.\n\nOfcom, the U.K.\u2019s media regulator, told the newspaper that it has opened four investigations into porn sites over compliance. However, only one of the 14 sites flagged by the Post was on that list.\n\nThe porn industry has been warning that this could happen.\n\n\u201cAge assurance legislation in other jurisdictions is failing for a number of reasons, including its inconsistent and ineffective enforcement at scale, leaving hundreds of thousands of platforms with age-inappropriate content accessible, most of which do not have content moderation or uploader verification measures,\u201d Pornhub\u2019s parent company Aylo said in a statement in June. \u201cWe know that when people choose not to age verify, they do not stop looking for adult content, they migrate to those irresponsible platforms.\u201d",

      "text": "Keeping minors off adult sites is a shared responsibility\nNicosia, Cyprus (June 26, 2025) \u2013 Aylo, a technology and media company, owner of a large portfolio of adult online entertainment properties, including Pornhub, YouPorn and Redtube, will introduce regulator approved age assurance methods in the United Kingdom by July 25, 2025.\nStatement by Alex Kekesi, VP Brand and Community, on behalf of Aylo :\nFor years Aylo has publicly called for effective and enforceable age assurance solutions that protect minors online, while ensuring the safety and privacy of all users. The United Kingdom is the first country to present these same priorities demonstrably.\nOfcom has consulted with industry stakeholders and has presented a variety of flexible methods of age assurance that are less intrusive than we have seen in other jurisdictions, giving us the confidence to operate within their framework. Our conversations with Ofcom have been constructive and solution focused. With hundreds of thousands of platforms (including adult sites and social media) in scope, Ofcom recognizes the scale of the challenge ahead, and is approaching it with thorough consideration. Ofcom\u2019s model is the most robust in terms of actual and meaningful protection we\u2019ve seen to date.\nWhen governments and regulators engage with industry in good faith, the outcome is not just better compliance, it\u2019s smarter, more effective solutions. We have and will continue to share data and engage with governments and regulators to find technological solutions that ensure minors do not access age inappropriate content online. Effective online safety regulation depends not only on strong policy frameworks but also on realistic and scalable enforcement strategies. With hundreds of thousands of adult websites subject to regulation in addition to social media platforms, it\u2019s essential that enforcement efforts reflect the complexity and scope of the digital landscape. We believe in Ofcom\u2019s intent and ability to enforce compliance with the Online Safety Act.\nKeeping minors off adult sites is a shared responsibility that requires a global solution. It requires cooperation between government, tech platforms and adults. We want to be part of the solution and are hopeful that the UK model stands to set a strong precedent to that end. We have long worked with governments around the world to better protect kids online. Age assurance legislation in other jurisdictions is failing for a number of reasons, including its inconsistent and ineffective enforcement at scale, leaving hundreds of thousands of platforms with age inappropriate content accessible, most of which do not have content moderation or uploader verification measures. We know that when people choose not to age verify, they do not stop looking for adult content, they migrate to those irresponsible platforms.\nWe continue to believe that to make the internet safer for everyone, every phone, tablet or computer should start as a kid-safe device. Only verified adults should unlock access to things like dating apps, gambling, or adult content. This is the core premise of device- based age verification, which we believe is the safest and most effective option for protecting children and maintaining user privacy online.\nAbout Aylo\nThe intersection of technology and culture. Launched in 2004, Aylo is a tech pioneer offering world class adult content platforms. The company provides trusted environments to enable a safe online user experience, and to empower its communities by celebrating diversity, inclusion and expression. Aylo holds a number of widely popular and diverse online adult entertainment and gaming properties. Its portfolio includes Pornhub, YouPorn, Brazzers, Men.com, Nutaku, and more, all of which maintain robust trust and safety protocols.\nContacts\nFor media inquiries, please contact:\nAylo Communication\nmedia@aylo.com"

      "text": "A U.K. government official wants tougher rules to stop kids from using VPNs to dodge the country\u2019s latest online safety laws.\nThe Online Safety Act, which went into effect this summer, puts new legal pressure on online platforms, including search engines and social media sites, to protect users from harmful content. The laws are mostly aimed at keeping children away from porn and other \u201charmful\u201d material tied to self-harm, suicide, and eating disorders.\nOne of the act\u2019s main provisions is that pornography sites and platforms with user-uploaded content must use technology to verify or estimate a user\u2019s age. That typically means requiring people to upload a government-issued ID or a photo of themselves to prove they meet the age requirement.\nBut users have already found ways around these new digital checkpoints. Some crafty gamers discovered they could use the photo mode in Death Stranding to trick age verification systems on Reddit and Discord. Most, though, are simply turning to virtual private networks (VPNs), which reroute internet traffic through servers in other countries and hide a user\u2019s real IP address. That makes it easy to get around the age verification requirements.\nInterest in VPNs spiked in the UK the week after the laws took effect on July 21, according to Google Trends. Now, one official is pushing to close the VPN workaround.\nDame Rachel de Souza, England\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner, told BBC Newsnight on Monday that VPNs are \u201cabsolutely a loophole that needs closing\u201d and called for age checks on the services themselves.\nIn a new report, de Souza recommended requiring age verification for the use of VPNs. The report argues the move would help stop underage users from accessing porn. A survey conducted right before the law took effect found that about 70% of children had seen pornography online, with X (formerly Twitter) cited as the most common source.\nThe report also flagged the violent nature of much of the porn kids are exposed to, with 58% of respondents saying they had seen porn depicting strangulation before turning 18, and 44% reporting seeing depictions of rape of a person sleeping.\n\u201cThis is having an impact on children\u2019s view of what is normal sexual behaviour,\u201d the report argues.\nA government spokesperson told the BBC that there are no plans to ban VPNs, \u201cbut if platforms deliberately push workarounds like VPNs to children, they face tough enforcement and heavy fines.\u201d\nIn the U.S., nearly half of the states have passed laws requiring porn sites to use age verification systems. Nine states have also approved rules forcing social media platforms to demand either age checks or parental consent for minors."

      "text": "Gamers in the United Kingdom have found a surprisingly simple way to bypass online age verification checks now required by law on some websites using just a video game.\nAn X user named Dany Sterkhov appears to be the first to discover the hack. On July 25, he posted that he had bypassed Discord\u2019s age verification check using the photo mode in the video game Death Stranding.\nSterkhov made the post just days after the U.K. began enforcing the Online Safety Act\u2014a set of laws passed in 2023 aimed at preventing children from accessing porn or other \u201charmful\u201d content related to self-harm, suicide, and eating disorders. Companies that fail to comply with the new laws could face fines of up to 18 million pounds ($24.2 million) or 10% of their global revenue, whichever amount is higher. According to the U.K.\u2019s media regulator, Ofcom, platforms like Bluesky, Discord, Grindr, Reddit, and X have already committed to adding age verification systems to their platforms.\n\u201cPrioritizing clicks and engagement over children\u2019s online safety will no longer be tolerated in the U.K.,\u201d said Ofcom executive chief Dame Melanie Dawes in a statement. \u201cOur message to tech firms is clear \u2013 comply with age-checks and other protection measures set out in our Codes, or face the consequences of enforcement action from Ofcom.\u201d\nBut it turns out some of these age verification methods aren\u2019t all that hard to trick.\nThe Verge and PCGamer have both tried Sterkhov\u2019s hack themselves and confirmed it works.\nMost of these companies rely on third-party platforms to handle age verification. These services typically give users the option to upload a government-issued photo ID or submit photos of themselves.\nDiscord uses a platform called k-ID for age verification. According to The Verge\u2019s Tom Warren, all he had to do to pass the check was point his phone\u2019s camera at his monitor to scan the face of Sam Bridges, the protagonist of Death Stranding, using the game\u2019s photo mode. The system did ask him to open and close his mouth\u2014something that is easy enough to do in the game.\nWarren was also able to bypass Reddit\u2019s age check, which is handled by Persona, using the same method. However, the trick didn\u2019t work with Bluesky\u2019s system, which uses Yoti for age verification.\nDiscord and Reddit did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo.\nDeath Stranding gamers weren\u2019t the only ones trying to avoid the age verification systems.\nProtonVPN reported on X that it saw an over 1,400 percent increase in sign-ups in the U.K. after the age verification requirements took effect. VPNs let people browse the web as if they were in a different location, making it easier to bypass the U.K.\u2019s age checks.\nIn the U.S., laws requiring similar age verification systems for porn sites have passed in nearly half the states. Nine states in the U.S. have also passed laws requiring parental consent or age verification for social media platforms."

  "argos_summary": "UK age\u2011verification laws for porn sites are backfiring: compliant sites are losing traffic while those that skip checks are gaining visitors, with some doubling UK traffic in August. Users evade the checks via VPNs or game\u2011based hacks, and Ofcom has opened investigations but only one site is currently cited. The policy, part of the Online Safety Act, aims to keep children away from porn but may be undermining its own goals.",
