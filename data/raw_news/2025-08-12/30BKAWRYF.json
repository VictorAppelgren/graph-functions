  "title": "China Urges Local Firms to Avoid Nvidia H20 Chips",
  "description": "Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde and Ed Ludlow discuss reports that China is urging its domestic companies to avoid using Nvidia H20 chips. Plus, Elon Musk accuses Apple of favoring OpenAI above other AI companies in its app store, even threatening possible legal action. And Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire discusses plans for new products as shares of the company soar following its earnings report. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "> > \u201cBLOOMBERG TECH\u201d IS LIVE FROM COAST-TO-COAST. WITH CAROLINE HYDE IN NEW YORK AND ED LUDLOW IN SAN FRANCISCO. ED: THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" COMING UP, BEIJING URGES LOCAL COMPANIES TO AVOID USING NVIDIA'S H20 PROCESSORS. MATT: ELON MUSK -- CAROLINE: ELON MUSK ACCUSES APPLE. > > AND WE WILL HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THE CEO. CAROLINE: AND THE NASDAQ 100, THE S & P 500 WERE UP .6%. VOLATILE TRADE AS WE ADJUST THE CPI AND CONSUMER PRICE INFLATION COMING IN WHERE THE MARKET ANTICIPATED. THEY STILL THINK THEY HAVE ROOM TO CUT BUT YOU ARE LOOKING AT A SEMICONDUCTOR STORY. ED: WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE CHINESE INTERNET DIRECTOR SAID THEY WANTED CERTAIN COMPANIES TO CANCEL ORDERS FOR EACH 20 A LOT TO IMPACT THEIR BECAUSE IT IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT BLOOMBERG REPORTED. BLOOMBERG REPORTED THAT CHINESE AUTHORITIES HAVE URGED VARIOUS CHINESE ENTITIES TO HOLD OFF ON ORDERING THE TECHNOLOGY. IT IS HOT ON THE HEELS OF THE BIG STORY WHERE THE PRESIDENT CUT A DEAL WITH NVIDIA AND AMD TO DO A REVENUE SPLIT ON ACCELERATOR SALES IN CHINA. CAROLINE: LET'S GET THE WHITE HOUSE PERSPECTIVE. WE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE TO SEE THE CHINESE RESPONSE IN TERMS OF PUSHING BACK AGAINST H20'S? JOSH: THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. THIS IS THE GLAMOUR OF THE PRESS BOOTH AT THE WHITE HOUSE, JUST IN CASE YOU THINK IT IS ALL SUNSHINE AND LOLLIPOPS. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] WE ARE IN IT AND SURVIVING. THIS IS THE TIGHTENING OF THE SCREWS AND THE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEM, THE QUESTION OF WILL THE H 20'S GO AT ALL. AND SAY DXY 20 PERCENT CUTS AND THEN THEY SETTLED AT 15% AND CHINA SAY MAYBE WE DON'T WANT THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. ONE QUESTION SWIRLING IS WILL THE ADMINISTRATION TRY TO DO THIS ON OTHER PRODUCTS WHETHER CHIPS OR OTHERWISE, TRY TO LEVERAGE EXPORT CONTROLS FOR NEW GOVERNMENT REVENUES. IT STILL SEEMS LIKE THIS IS THE MODEL THAT TRUMP WOULD LIKE. THIS SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE ON THE TABLE FOR WHERE THE MARKET WOULD BEAR IT. ANOTHER ONE IS WHETHER COMPANIES TO ACTUALLY EAT WHAT WE ARE REPORTING AS THE WARNING FROM CHINA OR THE REQUEST I GUESS FROM CHINA TO AVOID USING THE SHIPS AND WHAT WOULD ULTIMATELY THE DEMAND FALL TWO IF IT WERE TO FALL ON THIS AND THE QUESTION OF WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER SHIPS? TRUCKS -- TRUMP TALKED ABOUT WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING OTHER ONES BUT A PARED DOWN VERSION. MIGHT BE OPEN TO THAT. AGAIN, A LOT OF ANALYSTS HAVE SAID IF YOU ARE CHARGING PREMIUMS TO SEND EVEN MORE ADVANCED STUFF TO OTHER NATIONS, THAT OPENS THE DOOR TO ALL OTHER KINDS OF THINGS LIKE MILITARY SALES OR WHAT HAVE YOU. WE ARE IN UNCHARTED TERRITORY IN A LOT OF WAYS. BUT TRUMP LIKES THE IDEA OF THE CHIPS MOVING. AS LONG AS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS GETTING A CUT, FINE PRINT COME WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS GETTING THE COTTON IT IS ALSO UNFAIR. ED: WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS ALLUDED TO HIS JENSEN HUANG COMING TO A MEETING TO TALK ABOUT A LOW POWER VERSION CALLED ME 30 AND NVIDIA HAS NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THAT AND THE ANALYSTS LOOK AT IT IS A TACTIC IN THE BROADER TRADE. THE INTEL CEO ALSO CAME TO SEE THE PRESIDENTS. WHAT IS THE LATEST THERE? JOSH: THEY HAD THE MEETING YESTERDAY. TRUMP SOMETIMES CALLS AND REPORTERS TO MEETINGS BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN YESTERDAY ALLOTTED TO AND FRO. I'M WHETHER HE WOULD PUT PRESSURE FOR A SWAP OF LEADERSHIP. THERE BEEN POSITIVE SIGNS. THE PRESSURE IT SEEMS TO BE OFF A LITTLE BIT ON THAT ONE FOR NOW BUT WE ALL KNOW THE RESIDENT CAN BE WE ARE CURIAL ON THESE THINGS SO AS TIME WILL TELL. THERE IS A BRIEFING AND WE MAY GET MORE IDEA ON WHAT THEY SPOKE ABOUT. AND HE IS FOCUSED ELSEWHERE, TAKING OFF ON GOLDMAN AND THREATENING TO SUE JAY POWELL. THE BIG DATE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE WHITE HOUSE STUFF. RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE OUT OF THE WOODS A LITTLE BIT IF YOU ARE INTEL. CAROLINA: WE THANK YOU FOR THE PERSPECTIVE. THAT'S DEEP DIVE A LITTLE MORE WITH AN INVESTOR TAKE ON THE GLOBAL SHIP -- CHIP SECTOR. HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE THE PRESIDENT'S IMPACT ON CERTAIN COMPANIES, WHETHER ABOUT THEM DOING BUSINESSES OR SERVICES? > > THIS IS THE QUESTION OF THE DAY WHAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS TRUMP AT HIS HEART IS A COMMERCIAL GUY FOR WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS WHAT ARE THE RULES OF THE GAME THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO HIM TO RUN OUR BUSINESSES AND TO MOVE FORWARD AND I THINK THE DISCOVERY PROCESS, WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE AND WHAT DO WE HAVE TO GIVE TO GET HIM TO LEAVE US ALONE TO RUN OUR BUSINESSES. THAT IS WHAT THE CHIPMAKERS AND WHAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH NOW. I THINK THEY ARE GETTING TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY UNDERSTAND THE RULES OF THE GAME. THAT IS AN ACCEPTABLE LANDING SPOT. CAROLINA: BUT THE GAME OF PING-PONG HAS BEEN HARD WHEN IT IS ACCESSING CHINA AND ALREADY MAYBE WE SEE THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE PULLBACK OF THE PARED DOWN CHIPS IN THE FACT THAT CHINA IS SAYING WE DON'T EVEN WANT THEM. IS THAT A CONCERN FOR YOU AND THE LACK OF DEMAND LONGER-TERM? SCOTT: I THINK IT HAS TO BE. THIS IS THE LARGEST CHIP MARKET IN THE WORLD THAT THEY HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS TO ACCESS AND CUT SPECIAL DEALS TO HAVE ACCESS. ONCE WE CAN FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE RULES OF THE GAME WILL BE IS HOW DO WE SELL CHIPS INTO THE LARGE CHINESE MARKET, THE BETTER WE WILL BE IN THE MEANTIME I'M OF THE CEOS HAVING TO GO AROUND AND CUT DEALS AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS IT THAT WE NEED TO DO OUTSIDE OF RUNNING MY BUSINESS AND DOING THE INNOVATION TO MAKE CHIPS, WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO ON THE POLITICAL FRONT TO ACCESS THE SECOND LARGEST CHIP MARKET IN THE WORLD. ED: FROM THE CIO PERSPECTIVE, THE UNITED STATES PRESIDENT CUTTING AN AD HOC DEAL WITH A GET A SHARE OF REVENUE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN EXPORT LICENSE, DID YOU SEE THAT COMING? AND DO YOU EXPECT IT TO BE REPLICATED TO OTHER PARTS OF THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY AND HOW DO YOU MODEL FOR IT? SCOTT: I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU MODEL FOR IT. IT IS MORE OF A READ AND REACT SITUATION. AND THAT'S IS HOW YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH TRUMP. IT IS NOT A FORECASTING BUT READ AND REACT. I THINK THAT IS HOW WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT. ED: WHAT DOES A READ AND REACT LOOK LIKE AT HORIZONS AND IN THE LAST 24 HOURS? SCOTT: IT MEANS TO SOME EXTENT, FIGURING OUT SOME OF THE THINGS NEW IN THE LAST 24 HOURS, ARE THEY GAME CHANGERS FOR MEDIUM AND LONGER-TERM THAT WE THINK WILL BE IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF WHAT IS DRIVING SOME OF THE NAMES AND IT SHIFTS. WE DON'T THINK THAT THEY ARE. BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND HE IS A COMMERCIAL GUY AND HE WANTS TO CUT DEALS. HE WANTS DEALS TO GET DONE AND IF THAT IS YOUR STARTING PLACE AND THE DEALS ARE SOMEWHAT ACCEPTABLE AND WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE, IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE MEDIUM TERM BECAUSE THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY AND YOU NEED TO GET ON BOARD WITH IT. CAROLYN: YOU HAVE TO BE INVOLVED AND READ AND REACT. DOES THIS CHANGE THE ULTIMATE TAILWINDS OF GENERATIVE AI FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE FROM AMD AND NVIDIA MORE BROADLY. THE VALUATIONS WE HAVE GARNERED HAVE BEEN A GLOBAL OPPORTUNITY BUT IF WE CUT OFF CHINA AND CHINA MOVES AWAY AND WANTS TO GO DOMESTIC, DOES THAT IMPACT YOUR DESIRE? IT HAS TO ON THE MARGIN BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE LONG-TERM STORY. THE NEW CYCLE THE LAST 24 HOURS HASN'T CHANGE WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THE MEDIUM TERM AND THE ACCESS ISSUES WILL IT MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED OF COURSE BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL NARRATIVES ON DO WE WANT TO BE IN THOSE VEINS. AND DO WE WANT TO BE THERE? YES WE DO. CAROLINA: DO YOU WANT TO BE WITH INTEL? SCOTT: WE ARE NOT SURE IF THEY CAN GET INTO THE RIGHT TYPES OF CHIPS AND THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION AROUND INTEL RIGHT NOW. ED: I GUESS WHAT YOU ARE HINTING AT IS THAT VISIT TO THE WHITE HOUSE DOESN'T NECESSARILY SOLVE THE TENSION THAT IS THERE BASED ON THE PRESIDENT'S POST LAST WEEK. SCOTT: TRUMP DOES NOT LIKE TO BE WRONG FOR NICK THAT HE IS WRONG. IF HE CALLS FOR SOMEBODY TO BE FIRED AND IT IS A HIGH HURDLE TO GET THEM TO THAT. I'M NOT SAYING IT IS POSSIBLE BUT IN TERMS OF THE FUTURE LEADERSHIP AT INTEL, IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR INTEL TO MAKE A CHANGE LIKE THAT RATHER THAN FIGHT AGAINST THE STREAM FOR THE RIVER THAT IS THE TRUMP TRUTH POST. THAT BEING SAID, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO END UP DOING BUT IT DOES MAKE THINGS INFINITELY MORE COMPLICATED IN AN ALREADY COMPLICATED SITUATION FROM CORPORATE AND INNOVATION. THE MARKET IS ALREADY QUESTIONING. ED: SCOTT LADNER , THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COMING UP NEXT, NANCY TENGLER JOINS US FROM LAFFER TENGLER. ED: THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" \u266a ED: ELON MUSK LASHED OUT AGAINST APPLE'S APP STORE PRACTICES IN A POST ACCUSING THE IPHONE MAKER OF FAVORING OPENAI SAYING APPLE MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE OTHER THAN OPENAI TO REACH THE TOP OF THE APP STORE CHARTS. BLOOMBERG' IS KURT WAGNER JOINS US NOW FOR MORE. IT WAS SEVERAL POSTS THROUGHOUT THE TIME I WENT TO BED LAST NIGHT HERE IN LONDON IN THE TIME I WOKE UP. IN AGGREGATE, WHAT IS AT THE CORE OF MUSK'S COMPLAINTS? > > HE IS CLAIMING ANTITRUST AND IS SAYING THAT APPLE IS FAVORING OPENAI IN MORE PROMINENT POSITIONS IN THE APP STORE, ARTIFICIALLY IN HIS MIND PUTTING THEM HIGHER ON RANKINGS LISTS SOME OF THOSE ARE EDITORIALLY CURATED BY APPLE EMPLOYEES AND THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR YEARS AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR DEVELOPERS TO GET INTO THOSE LISTS TO GET THAT SORT OF PUBLICITY THAT WAY. A LOT OF THIS IS ALSO BASED ON RANKINGS, WHICH APPS ARE DOWNLOADED THE MOST FREQUENTLY AND IN SOME CASES, OPENAI AND CHATGPT ARE AT THE TOP OF THOSE LISTS. CAROLINA: AND USE X'S OWN COMMUNITY NOTES AND SAID IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN OPENAI BUT OTHERS HAVE ECLIPSED IT SINCE THE OPENAI AND APPLE CUT. SAM ALTMAN WEIGHED IN TOO. ED: HE HAD SOME SHARP WORDS -- KURT: HE HAD SOME SMART WORDS SAYING IT WAS KIND OF RICH THAT HE SAYS THAT. AND HE IS PUTTING HIS THUMB ON THE X ALGORITHM. HE IS CHANGING THE THINGS YOU CAN SEE ON THERE FOR ELON'S VIEW AND FAVORITE TOPICS. THAT WAS THE CORRECT THAT ALTMAN HAD FOR MUSK AND THE TWO OF THEM OBVIOUSLY HAVE A LOT OF HISTORY AS WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT REPEATEDLY ON THE SHOW. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE FOLLOWED, IT IS JUST THE LATEST IN THAT SAGA. ED: APPLE HAS NOT RESPONDED FOR COMMENT. BUT I WENT THROUGH ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS AND APPLE EXPLAINS THE METHODOLOGY BEHIND THE RANKINGS BUT ELON MUSK IS ALSO COMPLAINING THAT OPENAI AND APPLE ARE TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS AND FOR THAT REASON THEY HAVE A BIAS TOWARD THEM. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT? KURT: LAST YEAR APPLE ANNOUNCED A PARTNERSHIP WITH CHATGPT THAT IT WOULD INTEGRATE SOME OF THE OPENAI TECHNOLOGY INTO THE IPHONE. HE IS CLAIMING THIS IS THE REASON AND ELON MUSK'S MIND THAT OPENAI IS GETTING THE FAVORABLE TREATMENT. I HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT ELON MUSK IS NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO GO AFTER APPLE OVER THE YEARS FOR MAKING THINGS DIFFICULT ON DEVELOPERS THEY MIGHT COMPETE WITH. FACEBOOK AND MARK ZUCKERBERG ARE THE TOP OF THE LIST AT BEATING THE DRUM ABOUT APPLE BEING ANTICOMPETITIVE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WITH THE APP STORE FEES THEY TAKE AND OTHER THINGS. ELON MUSK IS NOT ALONE IN HIS VIEW ON THIS. WHETHER THAT VIEW IS SIMPLY FORMED IN ANY ROLE CAPPED OR JUST OPINION I THINK IS THE CHALLENGE AND CLEARLY HE IS VERY UPSET WITH THE OPENAI RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW WITH APPLE. ED: BLOOMBERG BEST GUESS KURT WAGNER AND AS HE SAID, HE HAS THREATENED APPLE WITH LITIGATION IN AN ANTITRUST CONTEXT GOOD WILL BRING IN MORE. LET'S BRING IN APPLE AND TESLA INVESTORS TO TALK ABOUT IT MORE NANCY TENGLER . YOU HAVE EXPOSURE TO APPLE AND HAVE ADDED TO IT RECENTLY FOR YOU KNOW THE TESLA STORY BUT THE ELON STORY AS WELL WHEN IT COMES TO AI. HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT THIS SITUATION WITH ELON MUSK ESSENTIALLY GOING AFTER APPLE? NANCY: I THINK EVERYONE IS ACTING TO SCRIPT. ELON WILL DESCRIBE HIMSELF AS SOMEONE WHO'S PROGRAM FOR WAR. THIS IS ONE WAY FOR HIM TO GAIN SHELF SPACE, RAISE AWARENESS, CLAIM FOLLOW AND THEN HOPEFULLY GET SOME CONCESSIONS FROM APPLE. IN TERMS OF THE EFFECT ON APPLE COME I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE LONG-STANDING. I THINK THERE WILL BE SOME SORT OF BEHIND THE SCENE AND SHAKE BUT IT ALWAYS MATTERS WHERE YOU GET INTO THE STOCKS. WE WERE ADDING TO TESLA AT 240 DURING THE TARIFF TANTRUMS. AT 333I AM HAPPY FOR THEN WE ADDED TO APPLE LAST TUESDAY, THAT WAS JUST SHEER LUCK AND WE PICKED IT OFF AT 202. WE CAN WAIT AROUND FOR THINGS TO RIGHT SIZE BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE END TO THE APP STORE AND I DON'T THINK IT IS GOING TO BE A BIG HEADACHE. HE HAS FILED A LOT OF LAWSUITS AND GOING INTO THE ELON MUSK LAWSUIT BLACK HOLE. CAROLINA: AT ONE POINT 2%, NO ONE IS TOO WORRIED BUT JUST DOVETAIL A LITTLE OF THE AI OPPORTUNITY WITHIN TESLA AND WHY YOU ARE NOT ADDING TO IT AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN MUCH MADE ABOUT WHETHER THEY WOULD HAVE A LOT OF CROSS-POLLINATION GOING ON. NANCY: I THINK THE CROSS-POLLINATION WOULD BE GOOD. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE TESLA ABSORB XAI. I HAPPEN TO THINK IT IS THE BEST SOLUTION. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE PEOPLE UTILIZE IT AND SEE THE COMPANY CONTINUE TO GO DEEPER INTO THE ATTIC PORTIONS OF THEIR BUSINESS AND HAVE IT BENEFIT THE TESLA SHAREHOLDERS. WE WILL SEE WHEN WE GET THE SHAREHOLDER VOTE WHERE THE SHAREHOLDERS COME DOWN IN TERMS OF INVESTING FURTHER BUT I LIKE THE ECOSYSTEM. WE ARE BUILDING OUT A STRATEGY THAT FOCUSES ON THE NEW FRONTIER OPPORTUNITIES, QUANTUM, NUCLEAR, ROBOTICS, GENAI. AND IN THAT WE WILL HAVE FRONT AND CENTER AT ONE OF THE LARGEST HOLDINGS WILL BE TESLA. ANNMARIE: I BROKE THE STORY LAST -- ED: I BROKE THAT ELON MUSK SAID FOR THE DOJO PROGRAM TO SLOW DOWN. A LOT OF THAT TALENT HAS BEEN REASSIGNED AND THE OTHER CHIP EFFORTS. HIGH -- HOW CENTRAL WAS DOJO FOR YOU WITH TESLA? NANCY: CONGRATULATIONS ON THE STORY. YES AND NO. IT WAS THAT WE WERE WATCHING IT AND WE ARE CERTAINLY FOCUSED ON QUANTUM COMPUTING AND THE ELEMENTS THAT WILL DRIVE IT BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE IT IN OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR FUTURE EARNINGS GROWTH. THAT IS A LOT OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO WITH TESLA AND ELON. HE IS ALWAYS THINKING, TRYING AND RESTARTING. SO WE WAIT TO SEE WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE AND WHERE WE THINK THE DIRECTION OF THE FIRM IS GOING. WE HAVEN'T ADDED TO IT RECENTLY BUT WE WILL AGAIN. IT IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT HOLDING IN THE GROWTH STRATEGY, IS NOT ONE OF OUR 12 BEST BUT I CAN'T HANDLE THE ELON VOLATILITY BUT I THINK THEY WILL FIGURE IT OUT AND I THINK THEY WILL PARTNER OR THEY WILL RESTART. CAROLINA: I LOVE GOING BACK TO THAT FOR UNTIL -- FRONTIER ANALYSIS YOU ARE GOING FOR AN EVEN MORE FORWARD THINGS. AND HERE NOW WHEN YOU OWN NVIDIA BUT WHEN YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION MEANS FOR FUTURE BUSINESS AND WITH CHINA'S OWN DEMAND IS, HOW ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT THAT STORY? NANCY: THIS STORY IS A LITTLE COMPLICATED AND YOU WILL PROBABLY GET THE CRANKY SIDE OF ME. I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SET BY THE ADMINISTRATION IT IS PAID FOR PLAYING. IT IS UNSEEMLY AT BEST. I SEE WHY JENSEN HUANG MADE THE DEAL. I WOULD'VE TO BUT FOR THE PRESIDENT TO SAY I TOLD HIM YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY US FOR THIS, THAT MAY HAVE GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES AND PROBABLY HAD IN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION WITH META BUT IT WAS DIFFERENT AND I DON'T THINK IT IS THE WAY WANT TO CONDUCT BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT SAID, WE HAD WRITTEN OFF CHINA INVESTORS AND THE COMPANY TOOK AN $8 BILLION CHARGE AND THEN THE MIDDLE EAST OPENED UP. SO I DON'T THINK THIS WILL BE THE DEATH KNELL. I THINK CHINA DID WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THEM TO DO, NOT IN RESPONSE TO JENSEN HUANG SAYING KEEP CHINA LOOKS ON OUR PRODUCTS FOR THEY WILL COME OUT AND SAY NO, WE DON'T NEED YOUR PRODUCTS. IT WILL SETTLE SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE AND WE WILL GET IN FOR MEDICAL -- WE WILL GET INCREMENTAL REVENUE. ED: HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THEY ARE PROTECTING THEIR OWN DOMESTIC CHIPS? NANCY: I THINK THEY ARE AND I THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO GET A BETTER DEAL ALWAYS. SO STAY TUNED. I THINK WE WILL END UP SOMEWHERE, AGAIN, IN THE MIDDLE. ED: NANCY TENGLER GIVING US YOUR CRANKY SIDE, WHICH WE APPRECIATE. COMING UP, GM LOOKS TO RESURRECT AUTONOMOUS AMBITIONS. THAT STORY AND SO MUCH MORE NEXT. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" \u266a CAROLINA: TIME NOW FOR TALKING TECH. GM LOOKING TO RESTART DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DRIVERLESS CARS. IT IS LOOKING TO LURE EMPLOYEES. IT IS SET TO BE FOCUSING ON AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES FOR PERSONAL USE WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL BEING A CAR THAT CAN DRIVE WITH NO ONE AT THE WHEEL. PLUS THE GITHUB CEO IS STEPPING DOWN. THE EXECUTIVE IS SET TO REMAIN TO THE END OF THE YEAR AND WILL NEED TO BECOME A FOUNDER WHICH WAS ACQUIRED BY MICROSOFT AND WILL BECOME PART OF THE CORE AI TEAM. ESPN IS AIMING TO LURE BACK, $30, I LET'S, AND -- HIGHLIGHTS LET'S, ORIGINAL PROGRAM AND SPORTS LINEUP WILL BE ABLE WITHOUT CABLE OR SATELLITE SUBSCRIPTION. ED: COMING UP THE CIRK UL CEO JOINING US AFTER THEY'VE GONE PUBLIC. I STILL THINK THE STORY OF THE DAY'S VOLATILITY IN THE CHIP NAMES. NVIDIA IT MODESTLY HIGHER. ANDY UP .8%. THERE WAS A REPORT THAT SAID CHINA -- AMD OF THAT WAS IN ORDER THAT CHINA HAS REPORTED THEM TO STOP USING THE CHIPS. THE STOCKS BOUNCED AROUND ALL OVER THE PLACE. SO MUCH NEWS. AND WE WILL HAVE MORE THROUGHOUT THE HOUR. FROM LONDON THIS WEEK AND NEW YORK CITY, THAT IS WITH THE INDEX LEVEL LOOKS LIKE. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" \u266a ED: WELCOME BACK TO BLOOMBERG TECH. MARKETS HAVE CLOSED IN EUROPE AND LONDON. I AM LOOKING AT THESE THREE NAMES. ACROSS EUROPE, SOFTWARE NAMES HAVE BEEN UNDER PRESSURE. THE CONCERN IS THAT AI IS GOING TO KILL SOFTWARE. THERE IS A NOTE FROM RBC CAPITAL MARKETS WHICH SAYS \"THERE IS FROM A VALUATION PERSPECTIVE DEATH OF SOFTWARE DO TO AI. THESE ARE COMPANIES THAT EUROPE IS SEEING STRONG REVENUE GROWTH BUT THE IDEA IS THAT AI ELSEWHERE JUST RENDERS THE SOFTWARE EARNINGS OBSOLETE. BUT SERIOUS DECLINES IN EUROPE A LOT OF WEAKNESS IN THOSE NAMES AND THIS IS SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE CLICKED ON THIS TUESDAY. CAROLINA: SIGNIFICANT MOVES. ON ANOTHER MOVING HIGHER, FOCUSING IN ON A NETWORK OPERATOR CIRCLED, SECOND-QUARTER REVENUE JUMPING 53%, $58 MILLION. THIS THE ISSUE OF STABLECOINS AND THE FIRST EARNINGS RELEASE SINCE IT WENT PUBLIC IN JUNE. THE CEO JOINS US NOW. JUST A BUMP IN REVENUE, WE KNOW HOW YOU MAKE A LOT OF YOUR MONEY AND IT COMES FROM TREASURIES AND OTHER YIELDING ASSETS. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER REVENUE GROWTH YOU WANT TO SEE? HOW ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT THAT PIPELINE? JEREMY: FIRST A BUMP IN REVENUE IS DRIVEN BY GROWTH. WE SAW 90% YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN A USDC IN THE CIRCULATION ON OUR NETWORK WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT. AND THAT GROWTH IS A DRIVER EVEN WHERE WE SEE RATES DECLINE. THE GROWTH IS DRIVING THE TOP LINE REVENUE GROWTH. ALSO SEEING GROWTH IN OTHER REVENUE. AGAIN AS YOU THINK ABOUT CIRCLE AND OUR BUSINESS, WE HAVE THE STABLECOIN NETWORK, MONEY THAT FLOWS ON THAT NETWORK. AND WE ARE ADDING NEW SERVICES, SUBSCRIPTIONS AND SERVICES FEES, TRANSACTION FEES FOR A WIDE ARRAY OF DIFFERENT THINGS. WE ARE BUILDING AN APPLICATION LAYER AND ANNOUNCED A NEW BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. THOSE ALSO GREW TO 50% -- 250% YEAR ON YEAR AND HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT HIGHER PROFILE SO THAT ADDED A COUPLE HUNDRED BASIS POINTS TO OUR MARGINS WHICH OBVIOUSLY TRANSLATED ON THE AGGREGATE INTO OUR ADJUSTED GROWTH OF 52% WITH A 50% ADJUSTED MARGIN. CAROLINA: LET'S DIVE INTO PARK THAT YOU REFERENCE AS YOUR CASH INTO ARC -- INTO ARC AS YOUR PAYMENT. HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU MARKET NEUTRAL AS AN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAYER? JEREMY: WE THINK ABOUT OURSELVES AS AN INTERNET PLATFORM AND NETWORK UTILITY COMPANY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN PROVIDE THE FULL STACK THAT IS NEEDED FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND LEADING ENTERPRISES AROUND THE WORLD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF STABLECOIN FINANCE. AN ARC AS A BLOCKCHAIN IS PURPOSELY BUILT FOR FINANCE. FINANCE FEES PAID IN U.S. D.C. AND POTENTIALLY OTHER STABLECOINS. THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS DESIGNED AROUND DETERMINISTIC FINALITY, THAT IS KEY. BANK REGULATORS WANT TO KNOW THAT TRANSACTIONS AND SETTLEMENT ARE FINAL. IT IS A KEY CHARACTERISTIC OF A PRUDENTIAL GRADE FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE. WE ARE BUILDING THIS VERY MUCH IN THE VIEW OF WHAT IS COMING. ALL THE MAJOR INSTITUTIONS THAT WANT TO BUILD ON STABLECOIN, MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE RIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLAY. BROAD INTEROPERABILITY ACROSS 24 DIFFERENT BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS, FUNDAMENTAL DOLLAR LIQUIDITY ON THOSE NETWORKS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND ARC WILL BECOME A POWERFUL WAY TO PROVIDE GREATER SUPPORT FOR LIQUIDITY AND INTEROPERABILITY. ED: THERE IS INTEREST IN THE OTHER REVENUES OPPORTUNITY TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CORE BUSINESS COULD I HAVE THE STORY IN FRONT OF ME AND THE AI SUMMARY IS, THE MAJORITY OF CIRCLE REVENUE COMES FROM U.S. TREASURIES AND OTHER YIELD BEARING INSTRUMENTS TO SUPPORT THE VALUE OF THE U.S. D.C. TOKENS. JUST FOR THE LAYMAN, CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE BASIS OF THAT? JEREMY: CIRCLE OPERATES THE LARGEST REGULATED STABLECOIN NETWORK IN THE WORLD AND THAT NETWORK REACHES OVER 600 MILLION PEOPLE GET REACHED IN THEIR POCKET AND ACCESS AND USE USDC. THERE ARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INTEGRATED TO THE NETWORK THAT PROVIDE WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO STORE AND MAKE TRANSACTIONS AND PAYMENTS OR INVESTMENTS USING USDC. WE HAVE A VERY LARGE NETWORK AND THERE IS DEMAND FOR THE DIGITAL DOLLARS AND THERE ARE DIGITAL DOLLARS ESSENTIALLY PURCHASED USING EXISTING MONEY AND IT IS IN FREE CIRCULATION ON THE INTERNET. THE MONEY STOCK ON THE NETWORK MOVING AROUND AND WE NOTED WE SAW TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN THE TRANSACTIONS IN THE NETWORK, SIX $20 OF TRANSACTIONS IN Q2 AND SEEING THAT ACCELERATE INTO Q3. WE HAVE HIGH VELOCITY, HIGH TRANSACTION MONEY ON THE NETWORK AND WE MONETIZE THAT TO THE RESERVE RETURNS. SO WHAT WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON IN THIS PART OF THE BUSINESS IS GROWING THAT MONEY STOCK AND THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT VIEWS AS TO HOW FAST THE MONEY SUPPLY WILL GROW. THERE IS AN OPTIMISTIC LOOK OF 90% IN THE LOWEST YOU IS 25% OVER SEVERAL YEARS. WE TENDED TO BE ON THE MORE CONSERVATIVE SIDE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THAT FROM AN OUTLET PERSPECTIVE. WE GREW 90% YEAR-OVER-YEAR THEN THAT WOULD DRIVE TOPLINE AS WELL . IN YEAR TO DATE COME WE HAVE GROWN 49% AS OF AUGUST 10, WHICH IS VERY STRONG GROWTH AND THAT AGAIN DRIVING AND SUPPORTING THE TOP LINE. WE ALSO BUILD OUT ALL OF THE NEW PRODUCTS WITH NEW REVENUE STREAMS IN SUBSCRIPTIONS AND SERVICES AND TRANSACTION FEES. WE ARE CONTINUING TO BUILD THOSE OUT AS WELL. ED: YOU GO THROUGH GOING PUBLIC IN EUROPE FIRST QUARTER AS A PUBLIC COMPANY AND THE FIRST THING THE MARKET IS GOING TO ASK YOU IS ABOUT IN ORGANIC GROWTH. WHAT IS THE M & A STRATEGY? JEREMY: WE ARE A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY. WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON SOFTWARE POWERED INNOVATION. THAT IS REALLY THE HERITAGE OF MINE AND THE REST. VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING WE HAVE DONE HERE HAS BEEN ORGANIC. WE LOVE BUILDING SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE DONE ACQUISITIONS. WE HAVE DONE THREE ACQUISITIONS THIS YEAR. ONE WAS A PRODUCT IN TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO ACCELERATE OUR ENTRY INTO THE YIELD BEARING TOKEN SPACE. WE HAD BIG NEWS WITH THAT IN THE QUARTER AS WELL. AND OUR TEAMS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS, BOTH SUPPORTED OUR EFFORTS TO LAUNCH ARC. WHERE WE FIND GREAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TECHNOLOGY AND GREAT PEOPLE, WE SEE THAT AS A NATURAL THING TO DO TO AUGMENT AND BRING SPEED AND VELOCITY TO OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES. WE ARE NOT HERE TO DO HUGE ACQUISITIONS AND TRY AND ROLL THINGS UP. THAT IS NOT OUR APPROACH. WE WILL LOOK AT THINGS AND CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS WHERE IT MAKES SENSE. THIS IS NOT AN M & A PLAY IN THE SENSE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. CAROLINA: TAKING US ACROSS THE BUSINESS, WE THANK YOU. THE IS CIRCLE CEO. BREAKING NEWS, MORE BROADLY ABOUT FINANCIAL MARKETS. ABOUT DATA AND IN PARTICULAR LABOR STATISTICS. WE GET TO THE POLICY EDITOR, MICHAEL MCKEE. SUPPORTING ABOUT THE PERSON POTENTIALLY TAKING OVER LABOR STATISTICS FOR THE UNITED STATES AND HIS VIEW ON HOW OFTEN IT SHOULD BE. BREAK IT DOWN FOR US. MICHAEL: IT IS A STRANGE SITUATION BECAUSE HE MADE THE COMMENTS BEFORE THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED HE WOULD NOMINATE HIM. HE DID AN INTERVIEW WITH FOX AND APPARENTLY THEY DIDN'T RUN IT UNTIL NOW WHAT HE SAID MAYBE GIVEN THE POOR JOBS REPORT THAT WE HAD, MAYBE WE SHOULD SUSPEND THE JOBS REPORT EACH MONTH UNTIL WE CAN GET THE NUMBERS FIXED. IT IS THE PRESIDENT THINKS THE NUMBERS ARE WRONG AND NOT THE STATISTICIANS. AND I AM NOT SURE WHITE HE WOULD DO THAT BECAUSE THIS WOULD MEAN THAT WALL STREET WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO TRADE ON IN TERMS OF JOBS REPORT. I WOULD THINK THAT WOULD NOT GO OVER WELL. ED: IF YOU ARE NOT SURE THAN I AM WORRIED BECAUSE I HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS RELY ON YOU FOR THE DATA. THE JOB SPRINT IS KEY TO WHAT WE DO WHEN IT COMES OUT. WHY DOES THE MARKET RELY ON IT SO MUCH? MICHAEL: IT IS A GREAT SIGNAL OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE HAVE JOBS THEY SPEND MONEY. WHEN PEOPLE ARE LOSING JOBS THEY DON'T SPEND MONEY. PEOPLE ARE SPENDING MONEY THEN COMPANIES HIRE PEOPLE AND PROFITS GO UP. IT IS THE LINCHPIN INDICATOR USED TO TELL US IN GENERAL HOW THE ECONOMY IS GOING AND THE DATA ARE DELAYED OR THEY GET REVISED BUT IT IS THE BEST KIND OF NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE ON A REGULAR BASIS, ON A MONTHLY BASIS. THE IDEA OF SPENDING IT WOULD GET NO TRACTION AT ALL. I AM NOT SURE THAT THE BLS COMMISSIONER WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY ANYWAY. ED: I AM JUST RIFFING A LITTLE BIT BUT IN TERMS OF MANUFACTURING DATA, I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHETHER HUMANOID ROBOTS ARE COMING OFF AND WE HAVE SOME BREAKING NEWS CROSSING THE BLOOMBERG TERMINAL. PERPLEXITY SAYS THEY HAVE MADE AN UNSOLICITED BID TO GOOGLE TODAY OFFERING $34.5 BILLION TO PURCHASE ITS CHROME BROWSER. I'M GOING TO REPEAT THAT. PERPLEXITY SENT AN UNSOLICITED BID TO GOOGLE THIS TUESDAY, 34.5 BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE GOOGLE CHROME BROWSER. THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT AND INTERESTING PIECE OF NEWS. WE WILL GET THE SHARES OF ALPHABET, THE PARENT OF GOOGLE UP VERY SOON AND WE WILL TALK TO ONE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY AND AI EDITORS OUT OF NEW YORK CITY. THE DETAILS OF THE STOCK OF ALPHABET OF A PERCENTAGE POINT. SETH: IT IS AN EYE-POPPING OFFER AND VERY MUCH A LONG SHOT. THERE ARE A LOT OF CAVEATS. PEOPLE ARE NOT PUT CHROME UP FOR SALE AS FAR AS WE KNOW. IT IS LARGELY IN RESPONSE TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WANTING A JUDGE TO ORDER GOOGLE TO SELL OFF CHROME. THE JUDGE HAS NOT PUT A RULING ON THAT YET. AND THE OFFER ITSELF, PERPLEXITY IS OFFERING 34 POINT $5 BILLION, NEARLY DOUBLE WHAT PERPLEXITY IS VALUED AT AN FAR MORE THAN THE $1 BILLION AT PERPLEXITY HAS RAISED TO DATE. THEY SAY THEY HAVE INVESTMENT FUNDS THAT ARE WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS BID IN FULL. BUT THIS IS A LONGSHOT OFFER AS OF NOW. CAROLINA: THEY HAVE MADE LONGSHOT OFFERS BEFORE. WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN AS FORMAL AS THIS ONE BUT THEY THREW THEIR NAME IN FOR TIKTOK. THE U.S. PART OF TIKTOK. NUMBERS ASIDE, THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN BUILDING THEIR OWN BROWSER. WHY MAKE THIS PURCHASE AND ULTIMATELY HOW WOULD IT BE FELT THEIR OFFERING AND TAKE AWAY GOOGLE'S? SETH: THEY DO HAVE A BROWSER CALLED COMMENT BUT IT IS ONE THING TO TRY TO BUILD YOUR OWN BROWSER FROM SCRATCH AND ANOTHER TO ACQUIRE A BROWSER THAT REACHES BILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD. THE IDEA SEEMS TO BE THEY WANT TO INJECT THEIR AI AGENT CAPABILITIES INTO THE INTERFACE WE ALL USE ON THE WEB EVERY SINGLE DAY AND GET FROM HER PEOPLE. THIS WOULD GET A MAJOR HEAD START ON THAT FRONT BUT THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY WE DON'T THINK THEY CURRENTLY HAVE. ED: PERPLEXITY SAYS IT WILL INVEST $3 BILLION OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS IN CHROMIUM AND THE OPEN SOURCE THAT SUPPORTS A NUMBER OF BROWSERS AND ALSO THAT THEY ARE GOING TO EXTEND A SUBSTANTIAL OFFER TO CHROME TALENT. WHAT DO WE MAKE OF THAT? WHAT ELSE ARE RE-REPORTING? SETH: I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO SHOW THEY WILL BE A GOOD STEWARD FOR A PLATFORM THAT IS USED BY BILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WHILE CONTINUING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR OWN VENTURE AND INJECTING AI CAPABILITIES INTO KEY INTERNET FUNCTIONALITY. CAROLINA: WE EXPECT THE RULING FROM THE JUDGE IN THE COMING DAYS ON THE REMEDIES THEY WANT TO SEE TO PREVENT WHAT IT SEES AS ALPHABET AND GOOGLE AND SOME SORT OF MONOPOLY WHEN IT COMES TO SEARCH IN THE UNITED STATES. LET'S JUST RETURN TO THE OVERARCHING GEOPOLITICAL STORY OF U.S. AND CHINA RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT HOW CHINA IS URGING DOMESTIC FIRMS, AI FIRMS NOT TO USE THE NVIDIA H20 CHIPS AFTER THE U.S. AGREED TO A REVENUE SPLIT FOR LONG AI SEMICONDUCTORS FROM NVIDIA AND AMD TO REENTER CHINA. A BLUEBIRD ECONOMIST WROTE ABOUT THE DECISION BY THE WHITE HOUSE AND WHAT IT WOULD COST THE U.S. IN TERMS OF AN AI ADVANTAGE. THE STORY GOES ON CONTINUALLY. WHAT WAS SO STRIKING ABOUT YOUR STORY WAS IF THERE IS A 50% CUT TAKEN BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW AND BE AN NVIDIA, THE WINNERS ARE NVIDIA AND CHINA WHY WOULD CHINA CLEARLY SEEMING TO PUSH AHEAD IN TERMS OF THE SEMICONDUCTOR OFFERINGS? > > ONE THINK IT WOULD ALLOW MORE IS SCALE. AND IS THAT COMPARABLE TO CHINA, IT CAN RUN THE APPLICATIONS THAT AI IS BUILT FOR. THAT IS SOMETHING WE DON'T THINK DOMESTICALLY THEY CAN CATCH UP ON FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS EERIE THIS DOESN'T CHANGE CHINA'S AGGRESSION IN TRYING TO BUILD ITS OWN CHIPS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT IT FEELS THE INTERIM TO ALLOW INTEGRATING AI INTO ALL ASPECTS OF CHINESE LIFE AND CONTINUE TO MAKE IT A GLOBAL PLAYER BUT THE QUESTION IS AND WHERE THE STORY HAS MOVED ON SINCE I WROTE THOSE WORDS, WILL THEY BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE DOMESTIC SUPPLY AND HOW WILL IT CHINA BALANCE SURE AI IS USING AS MUCH AS IT CAN WHILE MAKING SURE IT IS A HOMEGROWN EFFORT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. ED: ON YOUR PIECE AND I APPRECIATE A LOT HAS CHANGED. IT HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE DOING THIS FOR THE LAST 24 HOURS. YOUR FINAL POINT IS THAT THERE ARE TWO WINNERS, NVIDIA AND CHINA BUT YOU DON'T SAY THE UNITED STATES IS A WINNER IF YOU GET WHAT I MEAN. TRUMP IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE DEALMAKER BUT YOUR CONCLUSION IS TO BE A GOOD DEAL FOR NVIDIA BUT AMERICA AND AGGIE. DISH IN AGGREGATE -- IN AGGREGATE. IF IT WAS LAST WEEK I DON'T THINK THE REVENUE CUT CHANGES THAT CALCULATION. IT DOESN'T SEEM A GOOD ENOUGH CHANGE TO WARRANT WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN SECURITY POLICY. THAT WOULD BE MY OVERARCHING QUESTION ON WHY TO GO FORWARD WITH THIS. ONE OF THE DYNAMICS WE ARE STARTING TO LEARN IS WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE TRADE DEAL BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA. WE ARE HEARING ABOUT RARE EARTH METALS BEING A CONCERN AND THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF CHIPS THAT CAN BE USED AS WELL. THIS IS BECOMING A HUGELY COMPLEX NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. I WORRY THAT CHINA HAS THE THING OF SAYING YOU GOT THE PERMISSION FROM YOUR MASTERS IN THE U.S. BUT WE HOLD MANY CARDS AND LESS WE GET MORE THAN WHAT WE WANT IN THE TRADE DEALS, WE MAY NOT ALLOW THE SALE OF THE CHIPS IN THE COUNTRY. AND FOR NVIDIA, CHINA IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE BUSINESS, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF REVENUE AND COULD BE MORE. THEY HAD RIGHT OFF MORE WHEN THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE AGE 20 WERE GOING TO BE PUT IN PLACE. IT REALLY MATTERS TO NVIDIA TO PLEASE BOTH COUNTRIES. AND THAT SEEMS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AT THIS POINT. ED: DAVID LEE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S GET MORE ON WHAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM THE CHINESE POLICY. AMANDA HSIAO. . THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT HOW CHINA WOULD USE THE CHIPS AND A MILITARY. 24 HOURS LATER AFTER THE DEAL WAS CUT, CHINA SAYING WE HAVE NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS AND WANT TO CHAMPION OUR OWN DOMESTIC NAMES. HAS THE UPPER HAND IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS? AMANDA: I THINK FOR CHINA, A LOT OF THE SIGNALING IT HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN IS LARGELY PERFORMATIVE. YOU KNOW THAT THE CHINESE CONTINUE TO LACK THE CAPABILITIES THAT THE NVIDIA H20 CHIPS OFFER AND SO TO SOME DEGREE, THERE WILL BE STRONG DEMAND FROM THE CHINESE FOR THE USE OF THE AGE 20 CHIPS. AS WAS POINTED OUT PREVIOUSLY, THE CHINESE DO WANT TO CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN DOMESTIC SHIPBUILDING CAPACITY AND INCLUDED IN THAT IS PROVIDING SUPPORT TO NATIONAL CHAMPIONS LIKE HUAWEI BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHERE CHINA IS HEADED, CHINA WANTS TO BE SUPPORTING NATIONAL CHAMPIONS LIKE DEEPSEEK. THAT AI MODEL IS RUN ON NVIDIA CHIPS. FOR THE CHINESE, THERE ARE ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS BUT THERE IS ALSO SECURITY WANTS. I DON'T SEE THE CHINESE OUTRIGHT BANNING THE USE OR PURCHASE OF H20 CHIPS IN THE NEAR TERM. CAROLINA: INTERESTING THAT THE INFORMATION REPORTED THAT THERE WAS A FULL ON STOP LIKE BYTEDANCE OR TENCENT BUT FOR NOW YOU'RE THINKING THAT THERE WOULD BE A BAN. WITH WALLY AND OTHERS, WE HAVE SEEN THE MARKET OF THE HOMEGROWN TALENT. WHAT ELSE HAVE WE SEEN FROM THE CHINESE TO FOSTER THE BUILDING OF SEMICONDUCTORS THAT RIVAL THAT OF THE H20? AMANDA: THE CHINESE HAVE POURED MONEY INTO THE EFFORT TO DEVELOP A HOMEGROWN CHIP INDUSTRY AND WE KNOW THIS IS VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH THE TOP LEADERS VISION FOR THE COUNTRY THAT CHINESE DEVELOPMENT RISING TO NATIONAL REJUVENATION OF THE CHINESE, A KEY TO THAT IS TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT AND BEING ABLE TO RIVAL THE U.S. IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY AND AI. THE CHINESE HAVE MADE VERY CLEAR THIS HAS BEEN A PRIORITY AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A PRIORITY IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BUT NEVER THE LESS, THE CAPABILITIES THEY HAVE AT HOME REMAIN SHORT OF WHAT U.S. AI CHIPS CAN PROVIDE. CAROLINA: FOR THEY DO HAVE THE POWER IS RARE EARTH. IS THAT PART OF THE BARGAINING CHIP IF AT ALL? AMANDA: WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE CHINESE THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN I THINK A BIT SURPRISED BY HOW POTENT OF A WEAPON THE RARE EARTH CONTROLS HAVE BEEN IN THESE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE LIFTING OF THE SALES OF AGE 20 CHIPS ON THE PART OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN LINKED TO SOME SORT OF DEAL OR CONCESSION FROM THE CHINESE SIDE FOR THE CHINESE ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING THAT IT WAS NOT MADE AS PART OF THE DEAL TO MAKE CLEAR TO THE AUDIENCE THAT THEY DID NOT OFFER ANY CONCESSIONS FOR THIS. IN TERMS OF RARE EARTHS IN THE LARGER TRADE NEGOTIATIONS, ABSOLUTELY IT HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE CHINESE AND REALIZING THEY HAVE A KEY PIECE OF LEVERAGE AND I THINK FOR THE TOP ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AND REALIZING THE U.S. WILL REMAIN DEPENDENT ON CHINESE RARE EARTH AND THE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY. CAROLINA: THANK YOU FOR JOINING TODAY. COMING UP, A PIT. TAYLOR SWIFT HAS A SURPRISE ALBUM ANNOUNCEMENT. THAT IS NEXT. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH.\" \u266a > > WANTED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. > > DO WE HAVE? > > WE'VE GOT -- MY BRAND-NEW ALBUM, THE LIFE OF A SHOW ROOM. ANNMARIE: -- ED: SWIFTIES THAT BIG ANNOUNCEMENT ON BOYFRIENDS PODCASTS. THIS HASN'T DOMINATED GOOGLE TRENDING AND MOST OTHER SOCIAL PLATFORMS FOR MOST OF THE TIME I HAVE BEEN AWAKE. THIS IS BIG. TELL ME MORE. > > WERE YOU ABLE TO SLEEP OVER YOU JUST SO EXCITED YOU DO THE STATE OF WITH. -- WITH TAYLOR'S WITH. ED: THAT WAS ELON MUSK. LET'S STICK WITH TAYLOR. > > SHE JUST FINISHED HER BEST SELLING TO OR LESS THAN A YEAR AGO. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF SPECULATION AS TO WHETHER SHE WOULD TAKE A BREAK OR GO AWAY FOR A YEAR OR TWO AS SOME ARTISTS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO DO OR WHETHER SHE WOULD JUST KEEP GOING. SHE HAS BEEN ON THIS CRAZY TREADMILL WHERE FEELS LIKE SHE HAS NEW MUSIC EVERY YEAR IF NOT MORE OFTEN. AND HERE SHE IS WITH ANOTHER ALBUM THAT I'M SURE WILL BREAK ALL TYPES OF RECORDS AND I THINK IT IS INTERESTING SHE DID IT ON HER BOYFRIEND'S PODCAST. CAROLINA: WHO WINS HERE, THE PODCASTS OWNER BUT ALSO A MUSIC LABEL SHE IS AFFILIATED WITH? > > THAT IS A COMPLICATED QUESTION. HER MUSIC IS RELEASED BY REPUBLIC RECORDS WHICH IS A DIVISION OF UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP. BUT FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT HER DEAL, SHE IS DEFINITELY THE BIG WINNER. SHE OWNS THE ULTIMATE COPYRIGHT AND IS THE IP OWNER. UNIVERSAL GETS FEES AND REVENUE SHARES FOR RELEASING IT SO IT IS GOOD FOR THEM BUT IT IS NOT THE SAME AS WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT YOU FULLY CONTROL AND OWN. CAROLINA: WE WILL SEE HOW THIS UNFOLDS. WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMING ALIVE FOR US ON THE NEWS. THAT DOES IT FOR THIS ADDITIONAL BLOOMBERG TECH. AND IF YOU DON'T IN ANY SLEEP WHETHER IT IS ELON MUSK OR TAYLOR. ED: SO MUCH PLAYING OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA. A LOT TO RECAP. CHECK OUT THE PODCAST YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT ONLINE.",

  "summary": "China has urged local firms to avoid using Nvidia' H20 processors, a technology developed by the company that produces the H20 Processors. This comes after China's President, President Xi Jinping, made a deal with NVIDIA and AMD to create a revenue split on ACCELERATOR SALES in China. The H20's were reportedly sought by Chinese authorities who have been urging local companies to stop using them. The news of this prompted \"BLOOMBERG Tech\" to discuss the potential impact on the global market. The NASDAQ 100, the S & P 500, was up by only 0.6% as the market adjusts to CPI and consumer price inflation. The question is whether the Chinese government will continue to pursue this strategy, which could potentially impact the market.",
