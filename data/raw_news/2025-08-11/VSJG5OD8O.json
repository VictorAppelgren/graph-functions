  "title": "Steelers\u2019 Cameron Heyward hasn\u2019t ruled out skipping games amid contract dispute",
  "description": "The four-time All-Pro defensive lineman is seeking a revised contract.",
  "content": "LATROBE, Pa. \u2014 Steelers defensive co-captain Cameron Heyward, who has been quietly \u201cholding in\u201d during training camp, broke his silence about his unresolved contract dispute on Monday. After sitting out entirely for the second consecutive practice, Heyward said he hasn\u2019t ruled out skipping games.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely options out there that could reflect that,\u201d the 36-year-old Heyward said.\n\nTo put the situation in full context, you have to start with last offseason. Heyward had one year left on his contract \u2014 a time when the Steelers typically like to negotiate extensions. In 2023, he made $15.85 million in cash, but he counted $22.3M against the cap, according to Over The Cap. The team approached the veteran lineman and asked him to take a pay cut.\n\nHeyward had little leverage. He was coming off an injury-marred 2023 season, during which he was limited to 11 games. Even when he was on the field, Heyward was clearly less than 100 percent, playing through a core muscle injury sustained in camp, as he tallied two sacks and 33 tackles (six for loss).\n\nThe negotiation lingered through training camp; it wasn\u2019t until just days before the season-opener that Heyward agreed to a revised three-year, $45 million contract that runs through the end the 2026 season.\n\n\u201cI understand that I signed a contract last year,\u201d Heyward said. \u201cBut to be completely honest with you, when I signed that, I told them, \u2018When I have an All-Pro year, expect me to come back.\u2019 \u2026 I think everybody kind of giggled a little bit. But in my head, I used it as motivation to go out there and prove it.\u201d\n\nHeyward did exactly that, earning All-Pro recognition at 35 years old. Among interior defensive linemen, he finished the 2024 regular season tied for sixth in sacks (eight), fourth in pressures (56, per TruMedia) and fourth in tackles for loss (12). He also had two more batted passes (11) than any other defensive lineman.\n\nOn his current deal, which pays him $14.5 million on an average annual basis, he\u2019s the 22nd highest-paid interior defensive lineman, according to Over The Cap. The Chiefs\u2019 Chris Jones makes $31.75 per year, one of 15 interior defensive linemen who will make $20 million or more this year. Heyward said he\u2019s looking to be \u201cvalued.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the market and I look at what I\u2019ve done,\u201d Heyward said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to really wrap my head around playing at a number where I\u2019m not even half of what the rest of the market is.\u201d\n\nHeyward said that his representatives reached out to the Steelers in February to begin this process. He\u2019s already been paid $13.45 million in a roster bonus and is set to make $1.3 million in his base salary during the season. He\u2019s set to count $19.65 million against the cap this year. Asked if he\u2019s looking for the Steelers to convert some of his 2026 bonus money ($12.95 million) into guarantees, Heyward acknowledged that\u2019s part of the conversation.\n\n\u201dBeing respectful to the process of what both sides are trying to accomplish, I would definitely say that\u2019s something similar I\u2019m thinking about,\u201d he said.\n\nHeyward\u2019s ask isn\u2019t necessarily without precedent. Ahead of the 2004 season, franchise icon Jerome Bettis was similarly approached and asked to take a pay cut. Bettis and the Steelers worked out a one-year, $1 million deal. With incentives, the running back earned $1.4 million in cash, according to Over The Cap.\n\nOn that reduced contract, Bettis went on to rush for 941 yards and 13 touchdowns, earning a Pro Bowl nod. Before his final year in 2005, Bettis went back to the Steelers and asked for a raise. According to Bettis, the team slightly bumped his base salary up to $1.5 million. According to Over The Cap, he earned $1.6 million in cash in his final season between base salary and incentives.\n\nWhile Heyward has not been in uniform the last two practices, he began training camp as a full participant. As camp wore on, he quietly dialed back his participation and was only taking part in individual periods for about a week or so before the news broke of his contract dispute. The team isn\u2019t concerned with the missed practice time.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s had like 63,000 (reps) in his career, so he\u2019s probably good,\u201d defensive coordinator Teryl Austin said. \u201cThese guys that played a lot of football, they understand our scheme. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re in the new scheme doing something new. So I don\u2019t even worry about that stuff. I don\u2019t give it a second thought.\u201d\n\nHeyward said that he spoke directly with general manager Omar Khan on Monday and that he\u2019s been in contact with owner/team president Art Rooney II and coach Mike Tomlin. It remains to be seen if \u2014 and when \u2014 the Steelers will meet his demands.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to be out here,\u201d Heyward said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019ve had to be honest with myself to be ready for every option. Has it gone the way I wanted it to go? No. If it did, I would be out there playing and practicing. But I\u2019d like to put this in the rearview mirror and worry about ball and worry about the New York Jets Week 1.\u201d",

      "text": "LATROBE, Pa. \u2014 For the second training camp in a row, Steelers defensive co-captain Cameron Heyward is in a contract dispute.\nThe 36-year-old interior defensive lineman suited up for the first 12 practices (other than scheduled vet days) and participated in individual drills, but has not taken part in team drills recently. What appeared on the surface to be the Steelers saving a veteran for the regular season can now be characterized as a \u201chold-in.\u201d Heyward is seeking a revision to his contract, league sources told The Athletic on Thursday.\nOn Thursday, Heyward did not dress for practice as word of his dispute spread following a report by ESPN. He posted cryptically on Instagram, \u201cWhen you take things for granted, the things you are granted get taken.\u201d\nCam Heyward is not dressed for practice today pic.twitter.com/xnaFRhcFxF\n\u2014 Mike DeFabo (@MikeDeFabo) August 7, 2025\nLast offseason, Heyward was entering the final year of his contract and was looking for an extension. He had little leverage at the time, as he was coming off a 2023 campaign in which a core muscle injury (and the subsequent surgery) limited him to 11 games. Even when he was on the field in 2023, he was not 100 percent, as he tallied two sacks and 33 tackles (six for loss).\nAdvertisement\nThe 2024 training camp negotiations lingered until nearly the 11th hour before Heyward eventually inked a three-year, $45 million deal that runs through the 2026 season.\n\u201cBefore the season, I told him, \u2018Don\u2019t even sign a contract, honestly,\u2019\u201d his brother and Steelers tight end Connor Heyward told The Athletic in January. \u201cBet on yourself.\u201d\nThe current contract pays Heyward $14.5 million per season. That\u2019s less on an annual basis than 21 other interior defensive linemen. His production on the field exceeded his paycheck last season, as he earned first-team All-Pro honors for the fourth time in his career.\nAmong interior defensive linemen, Heyward finished the 2024 regular season tied for sixth in sacks (eight), fourth in pressures (56, per TruMedia) and fourth in tackles for loss (12). He also had two more batted passes (11) than any other defensive lineman. His presence in the middle of the defense was probably the biggest reason the Steelers went from 21st in yards per carry allowed in 2023 (4.3) to fifth-best last year (4.1).\nThe Steelers drafted defensive tackle Derrick Harmon in the first round of the 2025 draft and Yahya Black in the fifth round to strengthen their defensive front and plan for life after Heyward. However, Heyward is still a key cog of the NFL\u2019s highest-paid defense.\nHeyward\u2019s current frustration puts the Steelers in a tough spot. The team has handed out several big-money contracts this offseason, including a three-year contract extension worth $123 million for 30-year-old outside linebacker T.J. Watt and a four-year, $132 million extension for 27-year-old receiver DK Metcalf. They also acquired 30-year-old defensive back Jalen Ramsey, who counts $19.5 million against the cap this year.\nThe Steelers, who previously were reluctant to give new money to players on the other side of 30, have broken their precedent by signing and acquiring many aging veterans. However, the Steelers need to weigh how much they\u2019re willing to commit to the oldest player on the roster not named Aaron Rodgers. According to OverTheCap.com\u2019s latest projection, the Steelers have an estimated $19.2 million in cap space.\nHowever, the team traditionally likes to save about $10 million for in-season moves and may still be interested in adding a player elsewhere before the season begins.\n(Photo: Justin K.
