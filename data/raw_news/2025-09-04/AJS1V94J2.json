  "title": "Google Pixel 10 Pro Review: The Best Android Phone for Most People",
  "description": "The Pixel 10 Pro packs Google's best hardware and software into an elegant, compact device with standout AI features.",
  "content": "The Google Pixel 10 Pro (starting at $999) delivers a complete, uncompromised Google Pixel experience at a lower price point than the Pixel 10 Pro XL ($1,199). It has top-notch hardware, a beautiful screen, sharp photography, and advanced on-device AI, all built into its durable, mid-sized frame. Google's live in-call translation and natural language image editing add a \"wow\" factor unavailable from most other phones. We wish the battery lasted longer, but the Pixel 10 Pro's elegant design, robust software, and strong value earn it our Editors' Choice award, making it the best Android phone for most people. However, if you want the biggest Android experience, the pricier $1,299.99 Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's humongous screen, longer battery life, superior performance, and included S Pen stylus is our Editors' Choice winner for flagship phones.\n\nDisplay: One of the Brightest Ever The Pixel 10 Pro features a 6.3-inch screen at a resolution of 2,856 by 1,280 pixels, a variable refresh rate of 1Hz to 120Hz, and a brightness of up to 2,200 nits (HDR) and 3,300 nits (peak outdoor). The brightness ratings are an improvement over last year's Pixel 9 Pro, which reached 2,000 nits (HDR) and 3,000 nits (peak), but it shares the other specs. The Pixel 10 Pro XL's screen is larger at 6.8 inches with 2,992 by 1,344 pixels, but otherwise includes the same features. The 10 Pro's screen is the sharpest of the Pixel 10 series at 495 pixels per inch (ppi), compared with the Pixel 10 at 422ppi and the 10 Pro XL at 486ppi. The Pixel 10 Pro display is easy to see even on the sunniest of days, apart from the occasional glare. For example, the camera viewfinder is fully visible under the sun without needing shade, so you can always frame your shot. For comparison, the Galaxy S25+ has a larger 6.7-inch screen with 3,120 by 1,440 pixels, a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and a maximum brightness of 2,600 nits. The iPhone 16 Pro\u2019s 6.3-inch screen has 2,622 by 1,206 pixels with a variable 120Hz refresh rate. It reaches 1,600 nits (HDR) and 2,000 nits (peak). The Pixel 10 Pro's screen is the brightest of the bunch.\n\nGoogle's new Tensor G5 chip is the brain behind the Pixel 10 family and is made by TSMC with the latter's 3nm process. It's designed from the ground up for AI. Samsung supplied previous Pixel processors, and Google claims the G5 provides 34% more CPU speed and efficiency than last year's G4. The Pixel 10 Pro carries 16GB of RAM and comes in four storage options: 128GB ($999), 256GB ($1,099), 512GB ($1,219), and 1TB ($1,449). To objectively measure performance, we run a series of benchmarks that simulate certain use cases. Here, we compared the Pixel 10 Pro with the Galaxy S25+ and the iPhone 16 Pro, because they are in the same class and are similarly priced. Historically, Tensor processors have not performed well on these artificial tests. In Geekbench 6, which measures raw CPU Power, the 10 Pro scored 2,355 on the single-core test and 6,466 on the multi-core one, a sizeable improvement compared with Pixel 9 Pro (1,901 and 3,995) and even better than the 10 Pro XL (2,340 and 6,430). Meanwhile, the S25+ scored 3,109 and 10,054, and the 16 Pro scored 3,279 and 7,855 on the same tests. On the PCMark Work 3.0 test, which measures general mobile tasks, the Pixel scored 16,027, which is better than the Pixel 9 Pro (13,049) and the 10 Pro XL (15,722). However, its performance pales in comparison with the Galaxy S25+'s score of 20,872. This test does not run on Apple devices. To assess graphics and gaming performance, we use the GFXBench Aztec Ruins test. During its run, the 10 Pro recorded 76 frames per second (fps), while the Pixel 9 Pro pushed out 80fps, and the 10 Pro XL reached 75fps. The S25+ produced 87fps, while the iPhone 16 Pro scored on the low end at 58.8fps. For real-world gaming performance, we test with the resource-intensive Asphalt Legends. At the highest graphics settings and at 60fps, the Pixel 10 Pro rendered the game fluidly without slowdowns or dropped frames. The rear panel near the camera bar became warm, but remained comfortable to the touch. It's safe to say the phone can handle whatever apps and games you have on hand.\n\nBattery: Way Behind Apple and Samsung The 10 Pro is powered by a 4,870mAh battery capable of charging at up to 30W via wire or 15W wirelessly using the Qi2 charging standard. All three Pixel 10 phones include Google's magnetic charging solution, Pixelsnap, which is similar to and compatible with Apple's MagSafe accessories. In our battery rundown test, in which we stream a 1080p video over Wi-Fi with the screen set to full brightness, the Pixel 10 Pro lasted 12 hours and 40 minutes. Last year, we measured the Pixel 9 Pro's life at over 17 hours, so this is quite a drop, despite Google's claim that the battery would last 25% longer. However, the 10 Pro's battery life is in line with both the Pixel 10 (12 hours, 40 minutes) and Pixel 10 Pro XL (12 hours, 35 minutes). For comparison, the Galaxy S25+ battery lasted 14 hours and 40 minutes, and the iPhone 16 Pro ran for 20 hours and 33 minutes in the same test. When connected to a compatible fast charger, the depleted 10 Pro reached a 26% charge in 15 minutes, 50% in 30 minutes, and 100% in 1 hour and 35 minutes.

Google's battery tech has caught up in some respects, but battery life still falls well short of being competitive with Apple and Samsung.\n\nFor connectivity, the Pixel 10 Pro line supports 5G (sub-6GHz, C-band, and mmWave), Bluetooth 6, NFC, and Wi-Fi 7. Although the device does not support physical SIMs, it can run two active eSIMs. I tested the phone on Mint Mobile in New York City, which runs on T-Mobile's wireless network. On Mint, the phone reached max speeds of 500Mbps down and 46.0Mbps up, respectively. For comparison, a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 tested on T-Mobile from the same spot reached 544Mbps down and 58.2Mbps up. For Wi-Fi, I ran a speed test on my Wi-Fi 6 access point at home, and the 10 Pro hit peak speeds of 518Mbps down and 22.4Mbps up. From the same location, the Z Fold 7 hit 598Mbps down and 21.8Mbps up. When I tested both phones at the far edge of my Wi-Fi network, the 10 Pro reached 204Mbps down and 17.9Mbps up, while the Z Fold 7 reached 146Mbps down and 19.1Mbps up.\n\nThe Pixel 10 Pro features the same camera hardware as the 10 Pro XL (which is the same as the 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL). They all have a 50MP main camera with an aperture of f/1.68 and an 82-degree field of view (FoV), a 48MP ultra-wide with an aperture of f/1.7 and a 123-degree FoV, and a 48MP telephoto with an aperture of f/2.8, a 22-degree FoV, and 5x optical zoom. New for the 10 Pro series is 100x Pro Res Zoom, a feature you must download to the Camera app. It uses AI to fill in the gaps between pixels to make a more complete image. Unsurprisingly, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL produce nearly identical images, with the differences easily explained by changing lighting conditions or slightly different framing. Colors are more realistic than with older Pixel phones. There's now just a hint of oversaturation with outstanding sharpness and detail in each image. Pro Res Zoom at 100x is quite impressive, creating details for far-off subjects. It struggles with the finer details like letters, which is common for AI at this time (see sample below), but it fares much better than simple digital zoom. Left to right: Main camera, telephoto camera zoomed in to circled area (Credit: Iyaz Akhtar) The 42MP front-facing camera has an aperture of f/2.2 and a 103-degree FoV, the same as the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Again, both devices captured near-identical imagery in my tests, with any minor differences explained by lighting and framing. Colors and details are consistent across all the Pixel 10 Pro's rear cameras. Night photography remains a great Pixel feature. It pulls colors out of darkness with remarkable accuracy and generates good detail\u2014as long as you can hold the phone steady for three seconds. Local video capture maxes out at 4K60, though Google's Video Boost feature can produce 8K video at 30fps by processing uploaded footage in the cloud. In my tests, it took several hours before my uploaded 4K60 footage was converted to 8K30 via Video Boost. A 48-second video took over four hours to make the round trip from the phone to the cloud and back. The result, like any video captured by the Pixel 10 Pro, is gorgeous with excellent detail and realistic color.\n\nSoftware: The Best Google Has Ever Released The Pixel 10 series ships with Android 16 and Google backs the phones with seven years of OS updates, security fixes, and feature drops. This matches Samsung for the longest support commitment for Android phones. Comparatively, Apple's iPhones often receive updates for at least five years. The 10 Pro's powerful software is identical to that of the 10 Pro XL. For a more in-depth look at each feature, check out our Pixel 10 Pro XL review. Here are some highlights. Magic Cue is Google's proactive agent that provides you with information before you need it. For example, I looked up restaurants in Chrome and then went to Maps to search. Magic Cue grabbed those restaurant names from Chrome and placed three options above the keyboard. Two were restaurants, but one was the name of the post's author. It is not perfect, but it is promising. The Pixel 10 series can translate voice calls in real time while recreating both speakers' voices and intonations. The process is complete entirely on-device, and it is amazing. There is a slight learning curve to get used to the timing between translations, but conversations flow remarkably quickly. Only one person on the call needs a Pixel 10 for this feature to work. Camera Coach (found in the Camera app) teaches you to take better-composed photos through guided steps. It does not do the work for you; the Coach coaches. Google Photos uses Gemini to power natural language editing. Instead of using many tools to accomplish multiple changes, you can just ask Google to do it. In the example above, I had Photos change the background and my clothes. It is not 100% correct, but it took less than two minutes, so it's hard to complain. Modified photos contain metadata stating they were made with Google AI. Every photo and AI feature works just as well as it does on the Pixel 10 Pro XL.\n\u2022 4.5 - Outstanding: Best in class, acts as a benchmark for measuring competitors\n\u2022 4.0 - Excellent: A performance, feature, or value leader in its class, with few shortfalls\n\u2022 3.5 - Good: Does what the product should do, and does so better than many competitors\n\u2022 3.0 - Average: Does what the product should do, and sits in the middle of the pack\n\u2022 2.5 - Fair: We have some reservations, buy with caution\n\u2022 2.0 - Subpar: We do not recommend, buy with extreme caution\n\u2022 1.5 - Poor: Do not buy this product\n\u2022 1.0 - Dismal: Don't even think about buying this product The Pixel 10 Pro packs Google\u2019s best hardware and software into a polished, pocket- and budget-friendly package. It has one of the brightest screens available from a mainstream phone, delivers fast 5G and Wi-Fi speeds, and carries capable cameras that set a high bar for mobile photography. The speedy, on-device AI tools are a wonder to use and provide informative and fun results, whether you're trying to make restaurant reservations or improve a photo. We wish the Tensor G5 processor were a little speedier and the battery lasted a little longer, but those don't detract from the experience too much. Thanks to its combination of price, size, performance, and AI, the Google Pixel 10 Pro wins our Editors' Choice award as the best Android phone for most people. For those who want it all, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra provides a bigger screen, faster processor, and integrated stylus, making it our Editors' Choice for flagship phones\u2014albeit at a flagship price.",

  "summary": "The Google Pixel 10 Pro (starting at $999) offers a complete Google Pixel experience at a lower price point than the cheaper Pixel Pro XL ($1,199). It features a 6.3-inch screen with a resolution of 2,856 by 1,280 pixels, a variable refresh rate of 1Hz to 120Hz, and advanced on-device AI. The design, robust software, and strong value also make it the best Android phone for most people. However, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's larger screen, superior performance, and included S Pen stylus are Editors' Choice winners for flagship phones. The Pixel's new Tensor G5 chip is designed from the ground up for AI and provides 34% more CPU speed and efficiency than last year's G4. The 10 Pro's screen is the sharpest of the Pixel 10 series at 495 pixels per inch (ppi), compared to the Pixel 9 at 422ppi and the 10 Pro XL at 486ppi. The device also comes in four storage options: 128GB ($999), 256GB ($1099), 512GB ($1000), and 1TB ($1449). For real-world gaming performance, the real world gaming test was performed at 588.",
  "shortSummary": "The Google Pixel 10 Pro offers a premium, affordable Android experience with enhanced display, enhanced graphics, and advanced AI, but costs may increase if the Galaxy S25 Ultra's price increases.",
