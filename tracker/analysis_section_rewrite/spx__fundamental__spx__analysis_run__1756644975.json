      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Canonical Handle Mismatch**  \n   - *Issue*: The draft focuses on Ether, but the accepted canonical handles list (indices, rates, FX, commodities, credit/vol) does not include crypto assets.  \n   - *Action*: Either drop this topic (it fails the acceptance gate) or re‑frame it to a broader, canonical asset that can be mapped (e.g., “US Treasury 10‑yr” for the Fed‑rate channel, “bitcoin” if it were in the list).  \n\n2. **Missing Sign/Magnitude & Catalyst Window**  \n   - *Issue*: No explicit sign (+/-) or magnitude range for Ether’s price movement, and no dated catalyst window (e.g., “Fed rate cut in Q4 2025”).  \n   - *Action*: Add a concise forecast such as “ETH up 15‑25 % by Q4 2026” with a catalyst window (“Fed rate cut expected in Q4 2025”) and cite the source ID (OGK8WLL69).  \n\n3. **Over‑Long, Non‑Conclusive Narrative**  \n   - *Issue*: The draft is a multi‑paragraph essay rather than a concise, actionable view.  \n   - *Action*: Condense to a single paragraph: state the base case, key risks, catalysts, and confidence level, all with inline citations.  \n\n4. **Causal Chain Clarity**  \n   - *Issue*: The causal chain is implied but not explicitly linked back to the asset.  \n   - *Action*: Explicitly connect each driver to ETH’s valuation (e.g., “Fed easing → lower real rates → higher discount rate → higher ETH price”).  \n\n5. **Compliance with Acceptance Gate**  \n   - *Issue*: Fails both criteria (no canonical mapping, no catalyst).  \n   - *Action*: Either remove the topic or rewrite it to satisfy the gate.  \n\n**Recommendation**  \nGiven the current draft, the topic should be **rejected**. If you wish to keep a crypto‑related view, re‑frame it to a canonical handle that can be mapped and include a clear sign/magnitude and catalyst window.",
