  "content": "As many as a thousand cars a day are turned away at the front gate of Naval Air Station Pensacola when visitors realize they can\u2019t access the base from South Navy Boulevard.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem not only for the drivers who must maneuver to turn around, but also for base security.\n\nThe gatekeepers are often left dealing with long lines of traffic as they sort through who can enter, which contributes to traffic jams and speeding on S. Navy Boulevard when drivers jockey to get a better spot in line and wait their turn.\n\nEscambia County\u2019s proposed South Navy Boulevard Improvement plan maps out a solution for the problem \u2013 a turnaround feature, like a round-a-bout, at the foot of Sam Lovelace Bridge which leads directly to the base\u2019s front entrance.\n\nIt\u2019s an important part of the plan to improve South Navy Boulevard that aims to address blight and traffic problems, as well as build up the Warrington community and support the mission of NAS Pensacola.\n\n\u201cBase leaders are very interested in the turnaround aspect at the south end of the project where they have numerous people heading towards the base, realizing they can't get on the base, and then it's a procedure to make them turn around,\u201d Escambia Development Program Manager for the Warrington District Max Rogers said.\n\nRogers said installing the turnaround at the end of South Navy Boulevard along with variable message signs along the road informing people of who can enter NAS Pensacola from the main gate, gives drivers the opportunity to turn around without jamming the entrance.\n\nWhat improvements are planned for S. Navy Blvd.\n\nIt\u2019s one of many new features of Escambia County\u2019s South Navy Boulevard Improvement Plan - Preferred Alternative, the final version of the plan created after months of design and citizen input.\n\nThe last public input meeting on the plan was held at Lexington Terrace in Warrington on Aug. 28, but people can still comment and weigh in on it online at southnavyblvd.com/about/.\n\nAcross from the proposed turnaround, the county is also planning to create a public park on vacant property along Bayou Grande.\n\nBoost for base: Wanted: Your input on Escambia County's plans for S. Navy Blvd. in Warrington\n\nRogers said the county partnered with the U.S. Navy several years ago to purchase the waterfront lots with the goal of zero development.\n\n\u201cOur military bases are always concerned about encroachment of development,\u201d Rogers said of the park. \u201cPeople already go down there and view the sunset, and we took some good public input and we're proposing to add a couple parallel parking spaces. It'll allow people to legally park there and enjoy the park, and when they're ready to leave, they can just get in the turnaround and head on back.\u201d\n\nThe improvement covers the last mile for South Navy Boulevard from Gulf Beach Highway to NAS Pensacola.\n\nOther proposed improvements include eliminating the third lane that opens on South Navy Boulevard. as drivers leave the base and come off the Sam Lovelace Bridge.\n\nThe county wants to turn that additional lane into a 10-foot wide, shared-use path for bikes and pedestrians.\n\nThere will also be sidewalks and the placement of medians in the center of the road with trees planted at pedestrian crossings.\n\nWhat neighbors have to say about the final plan\n\nNavy Point resident Cathryn Holley and her husband attended the county\u2019s final public input meeting on the improvement plan. Holley likes what she sees for the most part but supports even more changes that would discourage speeding.\n\n\u201cWe like the whole area, but we just want to slow the traffic down,\u201d Holley said. \u201cThey're going too fast. You should see some of the accidents. They are horrific.\u201d\n\nJim Kauffman said the project is \u201cdefinitely needed.\u201d He said the main road leading to the base has been overdue for a makeover since he first moved to the area more than 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cI noticed that going into the base wasn't as pretty as a lot of the main roads going into other military bases,\u201d Kaufmann said. \u201cBut now the county\u2019s putting the effort into making some green belts along the middle, installing sidewalks, and new flowers, new crosswalks. I think it's going to be safer. I'm very excited.\u201d\n\nImprovements aimed at cutting down on speeding and accidents, as well as maximizing landscaping are top priorities of the plan, which was created with a lot of public input.\n\nCounty staff said they received 657 completed surveys, tallied 2,932 website sessions and saw 118 people who came to the first workshop in May.\n\nNavarro Jackson is president of the Warrington Neighborhood Watch, and he\u2019s happy to see positive development in the area, which is also beset with issues like poverty, crime and homelessness.\n\n\u201cThis area needs some beautification,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cOur men in uniform, when they come and go from that base, they deserve to see good things, not bad things.\u201d\n\nWhat's next for the S. Navy Blvd. improvement plan\n\nCounty staff say they plan to bring the project for final approval to the Escambia Board of County Commissioners in October.\n\nThey also need approval from the Florida Department of Transportation to repurpose the traffic lane. Once that is complete, the plan will enter the engineering design phase, which may take a year or longer to finish.\n\nThe county is casting a wide net to fund the multi-million-dollar project including pursuing RESTORE Act funds, Department of Defense grants and state funding.\n\nIn July, the U.S. House of Representatives approved $3 million for improvements to South Navy Boulevard.\n\n\u201cIt's a great project,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cI think it's a good step forward to try to address issues. It is a blighted corridor. If we improve the area, it can bring businesses to it. Sometimes it's a, \u2018Who comes first, the chicken or the egg?\u2019 Is it the private sector or the government bringing the infrastructure? I think by bringing this project, it will motivate and encourage new businesses.\u201d\n\nSheila Feltner agrees the project will bring up the entire community.\n\n\u201cI'm excited for the west side of Pensacola, not only for the base, but also for the neighborhood and for new business and for people to be outside in the park they\u2019re putting in,\u201d Feltner said. \u201cI see it as a real plus for all of us, not just the base.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pensacola News Journal: Escambia proposes turnaround, public park for S.

      "text": "Create a plan that improves mobility and safety for all modes of travel, enhances landscaping, and addresses lighting along the South Navy Boulevard (SR 295) one-mile corridor, from Barrancas Avenue southward to the deck of the Sam A. Lovelace Bridge.\n12-months | September 2024 \u2013 August 2025\nThe South Navy Blvd project is a collaborative process, involving many local partners and stakeholders. It was initiated by Commissioner Mike Kohler, Escambia County Board of County Commission District 2. Escambia County Traffic and Transportation is the lead department and serves as the project management team. Collaborative partners include Naval Air Station Pensacola, Escambia County Community Redevelopment Agency, Escambia County Planning Department, the Florida Department of Transportation, and the Emerald Coast Regional Council.\nBeginning with the construction of the Pensacola Navy Yard in 1826, Pensacola NAS has played an integral part in US naval operations for close to 200 years. Pensacola NAS is accessed through its main gate from the north by South Navy Boulevard. Thousands of naval aviators, support personnel, civilian contractors, government and civilian dignitaries, and civilian contractors and tourists have entered the installation along South Navy Boulevard. The corridor from Barrancas Avenue southward to the bridge crossing Bayou Grande into the front gate is a dated, 6-lane asphalt road with two lanes southbound, three lanes northbound, and a center dual left turn lane. There are sidewalks throughout the corridor recently completed on both sides of the roadway through an FDOT resurfacing project. There are no bike lanes. Driveways line both sides of the corridor, many of which do not meet spacing or width standards to foster safe movements to and from the South Navy corridor. There is very little street lighting, typically only a single light at the intersections and the three signalized intersections of Barrancas, Winthrop, and Sunset. A plan is needed to review the corridor through the lenses of access management, safety, and beautification for drivers and pedestrians."

The project, backed by federal, state, and DoD funds, aims to repurpose a third lane into a shared path, add sidewalks, and install variable message signs to guide access to NAS Pensacola.
