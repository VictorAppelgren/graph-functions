  "title": "How Ange Postecoglou is spending $8million payout after Spurs sacking",
  "description": "Ange Postecoglou campaigned hard to keep his job with the Premier League team, but to no avail. However, life away from football doesn't look too harsh for the 59-year-old.",
  "content": "Ange Postecoglou was brutally sacked by Tottenham in June despite winning the Europa League - but he is clearly living his best life away from football.\n\nPostecoglou, 59, received an $8million payout from the Premier League club, and a recent TikTok video shows the ex-Socceroos boss isn't kicking stones as he patiently waits for his next managerial opportunity.\n\n'Aussie Ange' can be seen dining at Sta Kala Kathoumena, an exclusive eatery on the Greek isle of Paros, where he rubbed shoulders with celebrity chef Stefanos Saratsis.\n\nAs the former A-League coach at Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory watches on, Saratsis slices the steak into ribbons before spearing a section on to his knife to add seasoning.\n\nPostecoglou gestures his approval to the chef as the clip ends.\n\nIt comes after Spurs chairman Daniel Levy recently revealed why Postecoglou was moved on from the North London club.\n\n'Ultimately, the decision sits with me,' Levy said.\n\n'Ange won us a trophy \u2013 a European trophy \u2013 highly significant and he's always going to be in our history.\n\n'However, we couldn't lose sight of the fact that we finished 17th in the league, we lost 22 Premier League games... it is impossible for Tottenham to be in that position.\n\n'We had to take the emotion out of it.\n\n'Whichever level you do it, no one likes telling somebody, \"You're losing your job\", but it is the nature of football.\n\n'We are there to win and yes, we won a European trophy \u2013 and it was fantastic \u2013 but we also need to win on all fronts \u2013 and the Premier League says it all.'\n\nLevy then swiftly appointed former Brentford boss Thomas Frank as Spurs' new manager in June.\n\nPostecoglou - who also received a $4.2million bonus for winning the Europa League - has been linked to a move to the MLS to manage Los Angeles FC.\n\nHe was also reportedly approached by Al-Ahli, who won the AFC Champions League in May and play in the Saudi Pro League.\n\nSocceroos legend Robbie Slater is adamant Postecoglou won't be out of work for too long.\n\n'He put himself in that top echelon by being at a big club and winning a big trophy,' Slater told Code Sports.\n\n'(But) the way he plays football, I don't think a lower club in the Premier League will look at him and go 'we can take that risk.'\n\n'He might get that opportunity in Europe, maybe Spain or France. 'He's gonna get a job, he will be in demand.\n\n'He won't have a job to start next season, but as we know in football it won't take long.'",
