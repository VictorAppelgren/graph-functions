TOL, the nation's leading builder of luxury homes, today announced the final opportunity to own a beautifully designed townhome at Hilltop by Toll Brothers in Reno, Nevada. Move-in ready homes with Designer Appointed Features are available in the community, presenting a rare opportunity for discerning shoppers to secure a new home on a quick timeline in this premier Reno location.\n\nThe stunning three-story townhomes at Hilltop combine elevated design with low-maintenance living. With finished basements, covered patios, and covered decks that extend the living space outdoors, every detail has been thoughtfully crafted to complement the Northern Nevada lifestyle. All remaining homes include 3 bedrooms, 2 to 3 full baths, 2 half baths, and 2-car garages, ranging from 2,636 to 3,010+ square feet. Move-in ready homes are priced from the mid-$700,000s.\n\n\"Hilltop isn't just about the luxury homes, it's about community, convenience, and a lifestyle that lets you lock, leave, and live fully,\" said Donna O'Connell, Division President of Toll Brothers in Reno. \"This is the last chance for home shoppers to be a part of this very special community. There's truly nothing else like it in Reno, and we're proud to offer such an exceptional value in this highly desirable location.\"\n\nSituated in a private enclave next to Lakeridge Golf Course, Hilltop residents enjoy blended city and mountain scenery, quick access to walking trails, and the convenience of being just minutes from the area's top dining, shopping, and entertainment. With its lock-and-leave lifestyle and beautifully finished interiors, Hilltop delivers the perfect blend of elegance and ease\u2014ideal for full-time residents or second-home owners seeking peace of mind.\n\nOnly a few move-in ready homes remain available for sale, and home shoppers are encouraged to schedule a private tour. \"Homes of this caliber, in a location this desirable, don't stay on the market long,\" added O'Connell.\n\nThe Sales Center is located at 1545 Golf Club Drive in Reno.
