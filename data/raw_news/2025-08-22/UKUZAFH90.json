  "title": "Big Business This Week: Is the U.S. economy entering its weird era?",
  "description": "The U.S. economy is in a strange place.",
  "content": "The U.S. economy is in a strange place. Inflation is stubborn at 2.7%, job growth numbers have been revised down, trade barriers are up, investment sentiment is dropping in some quarters like the global market for U.S. bonds, and yet the stock market keeps climbing to fresh records.\n\nIs the U.S. economy in its weird era? Are we about to go into a recession? Or are we set for a fresh round of market records?\n\nTo figure it all out, BBTW editor Peter Green spoke with Claudia Sahm, Chief Economist for New Century Advisors, and a former economist at the Federal Reserve. She is best known for the \u201cSahm rule,\u201d a Fed economic indicator for identifying recessions in real-time.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with the economy? Half the world is saying we\u2019re in trouble, and the other half is saying, \u201clook how wonderful it all is.\u201d\n\nClaudia Sahm: There\u2019s data out there for everyone. Growth has slowed this year, and some of that is we\u2019d had a few years of really remarkable growth in the U.S., far exceeding our peers. So some of that slowing down probably was getting back to something more typical. In addition, there have been policies put in place \u2014 not just the tariffs, but also immigration, that have a big effect on slowing the growth of the labor force. That\u2019s an absolute key input into how much the economy grows. Then we\u2019ve had a lot of uncertainty, and that also tends to slow down business decisions and household decisions, and so in the first half of the year, real inflation-adjusted GDP growth slowed considerably relative to last year. We have seen inflation start to pick up, and we\u2019re moving in the wrong direction.\n\nA lot of that has to do with the tariffs, which are slowly being passed through to consumers as a price increase that shows up as inflation. You could look at this economy and point to a very mild case of what we call stagflation: Growth slowing and inflation moving up. It\u2019s not a given that [the Fed] starts cutting interest rates quickly, because inflation still is and has been for over four years above their target.\n\nThe president keeps saying that interest rates are too high and a rate cut would stimulate the economy, making it cheaper to buy homes, invest in business and pay down debt, including the national debt. To what extent is that true?\n\nIt\u2019s a very persuasive narrative, and it\u2019s what people would like to hear. The piece missing from the narrative is that inflation is still elevated. The Consumer Price Index and the Personal Consumption Expenditure Index that the Fed focuses on are elevated. So if the Fed were to cut interest rates aggressively, then you could be in a situation where it would stimulate demand and that could be a problem in terms of inflation taking back off.\n\nSo what should we be looking for, then?\n\nThe Fed is in risk management mode. It\u2019s considering the risks of inflation becoming persistent, or even moving higher, and the risks of employment falling further. The unemployment rate at 4.2% is still very low. Inflation is going to move back down to target. The Fed knows that if we keep putting on this much pressure, we might lose the labor market. So it\u2019s a timing question within the Fed.\n\nSpeaking of the unemployment rate, you\u2019re famous for the concept of looking at the three-month moving average increase in unemployment to determine if the economy is in a recession. Is that an imminent danger?\n\nNot in the near future. While [unemploiyment] moved up in July, it\u2019s been relatively stable over the past year, between 4% and 4.2%, so the Sahm Rule calculation is far from its trigger now. We went from having very high immigration to now the reverse, and as you have fewer workers out there looking for jobs, you don\u2019t have to create as many jobs to keep the unemployment rate low.\n\nHas the data been affected by the fact that many of those who are now without jobs may be undocumented or afraid to register for unemployment or answer household surveys?\n\nA chilling effect in terms of participating in the survey could absolutely be at play, [and] you are taking a number of people seeking work out of the labor force. Typically, the changes are gradual. Aging happens slowly. When you have abrupt changes in the labor force survey, like with these immigration changes, which were very large increases in immigration followed by a very big decrease in immigration, that\u2019s a different kind of shock. It\u2019s not a recession, it\u2019s just the economy will grow more slowly.\n\nIs there a structural threat to the US economy that things could permanently shift because of the tariff war, and what that\u2019s been doing to the flow of goods and investment?\n\nThat risk is there, but as policies change and the administration walks back and tones down some of the more aggressive tariffs, not so much. The U.S. was really outperforming the rest of the world in growth and in productivity, and we\u2019ve seen a regression to the mean, but the risk of a structural decline is more prominent than we should be comfortable with. When it becomes part of the conversation, you have a problem.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for brevity and clarity.\n\u2022 Where\u2019s the Vig? After loudly protesting that the sale of high-powered computer chips to Chinese firms was undermining U.S. national security and U.S. efforts to become the world\u2019s biggest AI player, the Trump Administration has agreed to let chipmakers ADM $ADM and Nvidia $NVDA sell chips to China, albeit for a 15% fee. The U.S. Constitution forbids taxes on exports, so the deal is structured as a voluntary agreement, CNN reported. Instead, Nvidia and AMD will voluntarily send funds to the U.S. government. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to identify any historical precedent for this sort of arrangement,\u201d Sarah Kreps, director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University\u2019s Brooks School of Public Policy, told CNN. Foreign trading partners are looking askance at the arrangement. \u201cTrump\u2019s Nvidia shakedown is unprecedented and scary,\u201d wrote Australia\u2019s leading business publication, the Australian Financial Review. \u201cThe chip maker is the latest firm to learn about the U.S. president\u2019s new corporate playbook: threaten a company and then watch them agree to a \u2018deal\u2019.\u201d\n\u2022 Chrome-plated? With Google $GOOGL facing a possible court-ordered breakup in the next few weeks that could force it to separate its browser business from its search engine, AI start-up Perplexity is offering to buy Chrome for $34.5 billion. That\u2019s a lot, considering Perplexity is valued at only $18 billion. Google\u2019s 90% share of the search market has the Justice Department arguing that forcing it to divest Chrome would create a more competitive playing field. But Google, Perplexity, OpenAI, Microsoft $MSFT and others are locked in a battle to use AI chatbots to offer users short sentences rather than just a list of links. Owning Chrome would simplify things for Perplexity.\n\u2022 The appliance of science. GE Appliance, the washing machine, stove, and fridge-maker that GE sold to China\u2019s Haier Smart Home in 2016, said it\u2019s planning to spend $3 billion to modernize its U.S. plants over the next five years, creating 1,000 jobs.\n\u2022 There\u2019s a ($30,000 Electric) Ford in Your Future: Ford $F is about to shake up the EV business, with a promise to introduce a $30,000, mid-sized, four-door pickup in 2027. The key is a new assembly line concept that splits production into three simultaneous lines and which CEO Jim Farley called \u201cThe most radical redesign of how we manufacture cars since the Model T.\u201d High production costs mean Chinese players like BYD have amassed massive market share with their cheaper assembly lines.\n\u2022 Cage fighter: Paramount\u2019s $PSKY new CEO, David Ellison (son of Oracle co-founder and Trump bestie Larry Ellison), has just grabbed America\u2019s most vicious sport by the jugular, signing a $7.7 billion, seven-year exclusive streaming and broadcast contract with the Ultimate Fighting Championship, knocking out Disney\u2019s ESPN, which was paying half that. A top challenge for Ellison is boosting Paramount\u2019s streaming services. They gather only about 2% of U.S. viewers\u2019 eyeball hours, versus 8.3% for Netflix $NFLX and 12.8% for YouTube $GOOGL.\n\u2022 About that stock market: Both the Dow $DJI and the S&P 500 $SPX hit records this week, suggesting investors see stock prices continuing to rise, fueled partly by a cut in interest rates. Citigroup $C and Goldman Sachs $GS both predicted interest rate cuts of a quarter point each in September, October, and December, and traders are reportedly seeing a 94% chance of a rate cut next month. If that continues into next year, the Spring could see rates as low as 3% to 3.25%. But those bad jobs numbers, stubborn inflation, and the effect of tariffs on consumer prices have others worried.\n\u2022 Intel\u2019s back Inside: After a meeting with Pres. Donald Trump on Monday, Intel $INTC CEO Lip-Bu Tan may have lifted one burden from his shoulders as he attempts to revive the stumbling U.S. chipmaker. Last week, Trump grew upset over Tan\u2019s supposed links to the Chinese Communist regime. \u201cThe CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!\u201d Trump thundered on his own social media channel. After the meeting, Trump called their discussion \u201ca very interesting one.\u201d Tan is a U.S. citizen who was born in Malaysia and grew up in Singapore. Intel\u2019s shares have fallen 55% in the last five years, though they are up about 10% since Tan took over in March.\n\u2022 CryptoKlepto: When supposed crypto stablecoin TerraUSD $UST.X crashed and burned in 2022, as many as 1 million holders lost a combined $40 billion. Now the coin\u2019s issuer, Stanford-educated Do Kwan has pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud in federal court, faces up to 25 years in prison. \u201cI knowingly agreed with others to engage in a scheme to defraud\u2014and indeed, in fact, did defraud\u2014purchasers of cryptocurrency issued by my companies,\u201d Kwon, wearing a yellow prison jumpsuit, said in federal court this week. Kwon conceded he lied about the price-balancing algorithm that kept the coins worth $1.\n\u2022 You\u2019ve got\u2026a dial tone? Remember AOL $AOL , whose tagline inspired that Meg Ryan movie, \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail?\u201d Well, surprisingly, it\u2019s still got the old telephone dial-up service whose whirrs and buzzes were a constant feature of the OG internet. At least, until Sept. 30, when AOL is ending dial-up service. It\u2019s not clear how many people still use it, but in 2015, AOL still had more than 2 million dial-up users, generating revenue of more than $40 million of revenue a month.\n\u2022 MisMatched: Match.com and Tinder parent Match Group $MTCH agreed to pony up $14 million for love-hunters who found it hard to cancel their subscriptions once they\u2019d found their match. The companies said they admit \u201cno liability,\u201d but the FTC will use the money to pay back users who were forced to keep paying even after they canceled subscriptions. Who says money can\u2019t buy you love?\n\u2022 It\u2019s kick the can time again for Chinese tariffs. On Monday, Trump said he\u2019d hold off on China tariffs for another 90 days, in part to hold a summit with China\u2019s leader, later this year. U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports are now 30%, while Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports are at 10%. Just before signing the order, Trump made a call on social media for China to buy U.S. soybeans. \"Rapid service will be provided. Thank you President XI,\" Trump said. China imported about 105 million metric tons of soybeans last year, less than a fourth of that from the U.S. and most of the rest from Brazil. But tensions with the U.S. have China looking at Argentine soybean exports, and in the knock-on-effect world of global trade, rising prices in China have locals eating out less often, sapping demand for soybean oil, some of which China is now exporting to the U.S. for use in biofuel. \u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely that China would ever buy four times its usual volume of soybeans from the U.S.,\u201d Johnny Xiang, founder of Beijing-based AgRadar Consulting told Reuters. Soybean futures are up about 4% since Trump put off the trade war with China, but still down 3.2% since Trump took office.\n\u2022 More than just a bunch of Kevins? CNBC reporters found that Trump is now considering 11 candidates to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell when his term expires in April. That\u2019s up from four last week, which included two guys named Kevin: Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. Treasury Sec. Scott Bessent will interview them all, then pass a list of his faves to Trump. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s nominee for a suddenly vacant Fed seat, Stephen Miran, has markets on edge, concerned he\u2019ll push the Fed to slash rates too quickly. Miran\u2019s nomination \u201craises another red flag of risk on U.S. assets\u201d Richard Cochinos, a foreign exchange strategist at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note on Thursday.\n\u2022 Stats Man Down? President Trump\u2019s nominee to run the beleaguered Bureau of Labor Statistics, which Trump accused without evidence of changing employment data to embarrass him, is raising hackles on the right, with prominent conservative economists doubting the new man\u2019s credentials. The presumed nominee, E. J. Antoni, has spent his career at the right-wing Heritage Foundation, looking at taxes and social security, and not at the labor and macroeconomic issues that are the agency\u2019s focus. Dave Hebert, an economist at the conservative American Institute for Economic Research took a hard swipe at 37-year old Antoni in a post on X: \u201cI\u2019ve been on several programs with him at this point and have been impressed by two things: his inability to understand basic economics and the speed with which he\u2019s gone MAGA. I can only hope the Senate blocks this.\u201d\n\u2022 Ka-ching! It\u2019s complicated, but the Trump family cryptoventure World Liberty Financial $WLFI.X has a deal with a little-known tech firm called ALT5 Sigma $ALTS (no, that\u2019s not a key on your computer keyboard) to sell $750 million of World Liberty\u2019s $WLFI coin. ALT5 Sigma will finance the purchase by selling $1.5 billion of its own shares and will give an undisclosed number of those shares to the Trumps\u2019 World Liberty. Eric Trump will join ALT5 Sigma\u2019s board. Emulating what firms like Strategy have done with Bitcoin, the concept here is that shares in ALT5 are a kind of proxy for the $WLFI coin.\n\u2022 Hold the bacon: Meanwhile World Liberty\u2019s $USD1.X coin has generated some $4.5 billion for the firm\u2019s owners, largely through trading on a platform called PancakeSwap, which the Wall Street Journal reports was created by employees at big-league crypto exchange Binance $BNB.X. Binance\u2019s majority owner and founder, Changpeng Zhao, reported to be worth more than $70 billion, recently hired a friend of Donald Trump Jr. to push for a pardon. Zhao spent 4 months in jail last year, and Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines after a federal court found the platform had become a money-laundering hub for terrorists and sanctions evaders.\n\u2022 AriZona Iced Tea and the demise of the 99-cent can: Since 1997, AriZona Iced Tea $99CENTS.X has kept the price of its signature tall boy 22-ounce can at 99 cents. Its stock ticker symbol is even \u201c99Cents\u201d. Keeping up with inflation would have raised the price to $1.99, but founder and owner Dan Vultaggio, who grew up in Brooklyn where his dad managed an A&P supermarket, told the New York Times he\u2019s long believed in three principles: \u201cMake it taste good, make it look good, and price it right.\u201d But the Trump tariffs on imported aluminum may upend his strategy. While 80% of the aluminum used in his cans comes from recycled U.S. material, 20% comes from Canada, subjected to a 50% import duty.\n\u2022 Gentlemen Prefer Hane\u2019s: Montreal-based apparel maker Gildan Activewear $GIL will buy Hanesbrands $HBI , the North Carolina-based underwear maker, for $2.2 billion, in one of the first Canadian acquisitions of a U.S. company since President Trump slapped 35% tariffs on all Canadian imports. The two firms both use mostly U.S. cotton in their clothing, so tariffs would have a minimal effect on their business\n\u2022 Disspirited: Budget airline Spirit $SAVEQ emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, but budget flyers are not flocking to its bright yellow birds, and the company said there\u2019s \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d it can keep going for the next 12 months. In February, Spirit rejected a bid from Frontier Airlines. Last year, JetBlue and Spirit called off a planned merger after anti-trust regulators said the larger airline would reduce competition.\n\nGet Big Business This Week in your inbox every week\u2014and read it before everybody else!

That\u2019s what Elon Musk is alleging, saying that after Apple partnered last year with OpenAI to put its AI chatbot into its products, Musk\u2019s own AI agent, Grok is being shut out of the top ranks at the App Store. \u201dApple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,\u201d Musk alleged. \u201cWhy do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your \u2018Must Have\u2019 section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps? Are you playing politics?\u201d Musk asked in a second post. (Apple didn\u2019t comment directly). Musk is locked in a bitter feud with OpenAI founder Sam Altman, whom he sued last year for turning the company into a for-profit machine (Musk co-founded OpenAI withAltman in 2015). Altman snapped right back at Musk: \u201cThis is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn\u2019t like,\u201d Altman retorted on X. Their feud continues: On Tuesday, Musk lost his bid to dismiss a lawsuit from OpenAi claiming he\u2019s been waging a \u201cyears long harassment campaign\u201d using social media, press statements legal claims (see above), and \u201ca sham bid for OpenAI\u2019s assets.\u201d A jury trial is scheduled for this spring.\n\u2022 The Singularity is coming: Altman is clearly unwilling to let the rivalry drop. The Financial Post of Canada reports that Altman is preparing to start a new company funded by OpenAI to create its own human brain-AI interface. The firm, Merger Labs, will go head-to-head (or implant-to-implant, if you prefer) with Musk\u2019s Neuralink.\n\u2022 Pass on Gas: In Memphis, where Musk has built a massive data center to power Grok, locals are protesting the pollution from 35 un-permitted temporary gas turbines. A University of Tennessee analysis found peak concentration levels of toxic nitrogen dioxide have increased by 79% since the data center opened, TIME magazine reports, creating a public health crisis. An xAI spokesperson wouldn\u2019t comment to Time, but the magazine says that at a new xAI site in nearby Whitehaven, Tennessee, 66 more gas turbines have been unboxed. We asked Grok: How toxic is AI? It responded: \u201cTraining large AI models consumes massive energy, contributing to carbon emissions. For instance, training a single large model can emit as much CO2 as a transatlantic flight.\u201d",

  "summary": "The U.S. economy is in a strange place, with inflation at 2.7%, job growth numbers revised down, trade barriers increasing, and investment sentiment dropping. However, the stock market continues to climb. Claudia Sahm, Chief Economist for New Century Advisors and former economist at the Federal Reserve, explains why growth has slowed this year due to tariffs, increased immigration, and uncertainty. She suggests that the Fed is in risk management mode, considering inflation and the risks of unemployment falling further. Sahm also notes that inflation is still elevated and that if the Fed cuts interest rates aggressively, it could stimulate demand. Despite this, the unemployment rate at 4.2% is still very low.",

      "text": "The U.S. economy is in a strange place. Inflation is stubborn at 2.7%, job growth numbers have been revised down, trade barriers are up, investment sentiment is dropping in some quarters like the global market for U.S. bonds, and yet the stock market keeps climbing to fresh records.\nIs the U.S. economy in its weird era? Are we about to go into a recession? Or are we set for a fresh round of market records?\nTo figure it all out, BBTW editor Peter Green spoke with Claudia Sahm, Chief Economist for New Century Advisors, and a former economist at the Federal Reserve. She is best known for the \u201cSahm rule,\u201d a Fed economic indicator for identifying recessions in real-time.\nWhat\u2019s going on with the economy? Half the world is saying we\u2019re in trouble, and the other half is saying, \u201clook how wonderful it all is.\u201d\nClaudia Sahm: There\u2019s data out there for everyone. Growth has slowed this year, and some of that is we\u2019d had a few years of really remarkable growth in the U.S., far exceeding our peers. So some of that slowing down probably was getting back to something more typical. In addition, there have been policies put in place \u2014 not just the tariffs, but also immigration, that have a big effect on slowing the growth of the labor force. That\u2019s an absolute key input into how much the economy grows. Then we\u2019ve had a lot of uncertainty, and that also tends to slow down business decisions and household decisions, and so in the first half of the year, real inflation-adjusted GDP growth slowed considerably relative to last year. We have seen inflation start to pick up, and we\u2019re moving in the wrong direction.\nWhat\u2019s fueling that?\nA lot of that has to do with the tariffs, which are slowly being passed through to consumers as a price increase that shows up as inflation. You could look at this economy and point to a very mild case of what we call stagflation: Growth slowing and inflation moving up. It\u2019s not a given that [the Fed] starts cutting interest rates quickly, because inflation still is and has been for over four years above their target.\nThe president keeps saying that interest rates are too high and a rate cut would stimulate the economy, making it cheaper to buy homes, invest in business and pay down debt, including the national debt. To what extent is that true?\nIt\u2019s a very persuasive narrative, and it\u2019s what people would like to hear. The piece missing from the narrative is that inflation is still elevated. The Consumer Price Index and the Personal Consumption Expenditure Index that the Fed focuses on are elevated. So if the Fed were to cut interest rates aggressively, then you could be in a situation where it would stimulate demand and that could be a problem in terms of inflation taking back off.\nSo what should we be looking for, then?\nThe Fed is in risk management mode. It\u2019s considering the risks of inflation becoming persistent, or even moving higher, and the risks of employment falling further. The unemployment rate at 4.2% is still very low. Inflation is going to move back down to target. The Fed knows that if we keep putting on this much pressure, we might lose the labor market. So it\u2019s a timing question within the Fed.\nSpeaking of the unemployment rate, you\u2019re famous for the concept of looking at the three-month moving average increase in unemployment to determine if the economy is in a recession. Is that an imminent danger?\nNot in the near future. While [unemploiyment] moved up in July, it\u2019s been relatively stable over the past year, between 4% and 4.2%, so the Sahm Rule calculation is far from its trigger now. We went from having very high immigration to now the reverse, and as you have fewer workers out there looking for jobs, you don\u2019t have to create as many jobs to keep the unemployment rate low.\nHas the data been affected by the fact that many of those who are now without jobs may be undocumented or afraid to register for unemployment or answer household surveys?\nA chilling effect in terms of participating in the survey could absolutely be at play, [and] you are taking a number of people seeking work out of the labor force. Typically, the changes are gradual. Aging happens slowly. When you have abrupt changes in the labor force survey, like with these immigration changes, which were very large increases in immigration followed by a very big decrease in immigration, that\u2019s a different kind of shock. It\u2019s not a recession, it\u2019s just the economy will grow more slowly.\nIs there a structural threat to the US economy that things could permanently shift because of the tariff war, and what that\u2019s been doing to the flow of goods and investment?\nThat risk is there, but as policies change and the administration walks back and tones down some of the more aggressive tariffs, not so much. The U.S. was really outperforming the rest of the world in growth and in productivity, and we\u2019ve seen a regression to the mean, but the risk of a structural decline is more prominent than we should be comfortable with. When it becomes part of the conversation, you have a problem.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for brevity and clarity.\n\u2014Peter S. Green\nWatch Big Business This Week on Cheddar\u2014and YouTube!\nThe usual suspects\n- Where\u2019s the Vig? After loudly protesting that the sale of high-powered computer chips to Chinese firms was undermining U.S. national security and U.S. efforts to become the world\u2019s biggest AI player, the Trump Administration has agreed to let chipmakers ADM $ADM and Nvidia $NVDA sell chips to China, albeit for a 15% fee. The U.S. Constitution forbids taxes on exports, so the deal is structured as a voluntary agreement, CNN reported. Instead, Nvidia and AMD will voluntarily send funds to the U.S. government. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to identify any historical precedent for this sort of arrangement,\u201d Sarah Kreps, director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University\u2019s Brooks School of Public Policy, told CNN. Foreign trading partners are looking askance at the arrangement. \u201cTrump\u2019s Nvidia shakedown is unprecedented and scary,\u201d wrote Australia\u2019s leading business publication, the Australian Financial Review. \u201cThe chip maker is the latest firm to learn about the U.S. president\u2019s new corporate playbook: threaten a company and then watch them agree to a \u2018deal\u2019.\u201d\n- Chrome-plated? With Google $GOOGL facing a possible court-ordered breakup in the next few weeks that could force it to separate its browser business from its search engine, AI start-up Perplexity is offering to buy Chrome for $34.5 billion. That\u2019s a lot, considering Perplexity is valued at only $18 billion. Google\u2019s 90% share of the search market has the Justice Department arguing that forcing it to divest Chrome would create a more competitive playing field. But Google, Perplexity, OpenAI, Microsoft $MSFT and others are locked in a battle to use AI chatbots to offer users short sentences rather than just a list of links. Owning Chrome would simplify things for Perplexity.\n- The appliance of science. GE Appliance, the washing machine, stove, and fridge-maker that GE sold to China\u2019s Haier Smart Home in 2016, said it\u2019s planning to spend $3 billion to modernize its U.S. plants over the next five years, creating 1,000 jobs.\n- There\u2019s a ($30,000 Electric) Ford in Your Future: Ford $F is about to shake up the EV business, with a promise to introduce a $30,000, mid-sized, four-door pickup in 2027. The key is a new assembly line concept that splits production into three simultaneous lines and which CEO Jim Farley called \u201cThe most radical redesign of how we manufacture cars since the Model T.\u201d High production costs mean Chinese players like BYD have amassed massive market share with their cheaper assembly lines.\n- Cage fighter: Paramount\u2019s $PSKY new CEO, David Ellison (son of Oracle co-founder and Trump bestie Larry Ellison), has just grabbed America\u2019s most vicious sport by the jugular, signing a $7.7 billion, seven-year exclusive streaming and broadcast contract with the Ultimate Fighting Championship, knocking out Disney\u2019s ESPN, which was paying half that. A top challenge for Ellison is boosting Paramount\u2019s streaming services. They gather only about 2% of U.S. viewers\u2019 eyeball hours, versus 8.3% for Netflix $NFLX and 12.8% for YouTube $GOOGL.\n- About that stock market: Both the Dow $DJI and the S&P 500 $SPX hit records this week, suggesting investors see stock prices continuing to rise, fueled partly by a cut in interest rates. Citigroup $C and Goldman Sachs $GS both predicted interest rate cuts of a quarter point each in September, October, and December, and traders are reportedly seeing a 94% chance of a rate cut next month. If that continues into next year, the Spring could see rates as low as 3% to 3.25%. But those bad jobs numbers, stubborn inflation, and the effect of tariffs on consumer prices have others worried.\n- Intel\u2019s back Inside: After a meeting with Pres. Donald Trump on Monday, Intel $INTC CEO Lip-Bu Tan may have lifted one burden from his shoulders as he attempts to revive the stumbling U.S. chipmaker. Last week, Trump grew upset over Tan\u2019s supposed links to the Chinese Communist regime. \u201cThe CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!\u201d Trump thundered on his own social media channel. After the meeting, Trump called their discussion \u201ca very interesting one.\u201d Tan is a U.S. citizen who was born in Malaysia and grew up in Singapore. Intel\u2019s shares have fallen 55% in the last five years, though they are up about 10% since Tan took over in March.\nThe short stack\n- CryptoKlepto: When supposed crypto stablecoin TerraUSD $UST.X crashed and burned in 2022, as many as 1 million holders lost a combined $40 billion. Now the coin\u2019s issuer, Stanford-educated Do Kwan has pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud in federal court, faces up to 25 years in prison. \u201cI knowingly agreed with others to engage in a scheme to defraud\u2014and indeed, in fact, did defraud\u2014purchasers of cryptocurrency issued by my companies,\u201d Kwon, wearing a yellow prison jumpsuit, said in federal court this week. Kwon conceded he lied about the price-balancing algorithm that kept the coins worth $1.\n- You\u2019ve got\u2026a dial tone? Remember AOL $AOL , whose tagline inspired that Meg Ryan movie, \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail?\u201d Well, surprisingly, it\u2019s still got the old telephone dial-up service whose whirrs and buzzes were a constant feature of the OG internet. At least, until Sept. 30, when AOL is ending dial-up service. It\u2019s not clear how many people still use it, but in 2015, AOL still had more than 2 million dial-up users, generating revenue of more than $40 million of revenue a month.\n- MisMatched: Match.com and Tinder parent Match Group $MTCH agreed to pony up $14 million for love-hunters who found it hard to cancel their subscriptions once they\u2019d found their match. The companies said they admit \u201cno liability,\u201d but the FTC will use the money to pay back users who were forced to keep paying even after they canceled subscriptions. Who says money can\u2019t buy you love?\nTrumplandia\n- It\u2019s kick the can time again for Chinese tariffs. On Monday, Trump said he\u2019d hold off on China tariffs for another 90 days, in part to hold a summit with China\u2019s leader, later this year. U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports are now 30%, while Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports are at 10%. Just before signing the order, Trump made a call on social media for China to buy U.S. soybeans. \"Rapid service will be provided. Thank you President XI,\" Trump said. China imported about 105 million metric tons of soybeans last year, less than a fourth of that from the U.S. and most of the rest from Brazil. But tensions with the U.S. have China looking at Argentine soybean exports, and in the knock-on-effect world of global trade, rising prices in China have locals eating out less often, sapping demand for soybean oil, some of which China is now exporting to the U.S. for use in biofuel. \u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely that China would ever buy four times its usual volume of soybeans from the U.S.,\u201d Johnny Xiang, founder of Beijing-based AgRadar Consulting told Reuters. Soybean futures are up about 4% since Trump put off the trade war with China, but still down 3.2% since Trump took office.\n- More than just a bunch of Kevins? CNBC reporters found that Trump is now considering 11 candidates to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell when his term expires in April. That\u2019s up from four last week, which included two guys named Kevin: Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. Treasury Sec. Scott Bessent will interview them all, then pass a list of his faves to Trump. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s nominee for a suddenly vacant Fed seat, Stephen Miran, has markets on edge, concerned he\u2019ll push the Fed to slash rates too quickly. Miran\u2019s nomination \u201craises another red flag of risk on U.S. assets\u201d Richard Cochinos, a foreign exchange strategist at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note on Thursday.\n- Stats Man Down? President Trump\u2019s nominee to run the beleaguered Bureau of Labor Statistics, which Trump accused without evidence of changing employment data to embarrass him, is raising hackles on the right, with prominent conservative economists doubting the new man\u2019s credentials. The presumed nominee, E. J. Antoni, has spent his career at the right-wing Heritage Foundation, looking at taxes and social security, and not at the labor and macroeconomic issues that are the agency\u2019s focus. Dave Hebert, an economist at the conservative American Institute for Economic Research took a hard swipe at 37-year old Antoni in a post on X: \u201cI\u2019ve been on several programs with him at this point and have been impressed by two things: his inability to understand basic economics and the speed with which he\u2019s gone MAGA. I can only hope the Senate blocks this.\u201d\n- Ka-ching! It\u2019s complicated, but the Trump family cryptoventure World Liberty Financial $WLFI.X has a deal with a little-known tech firm called ALT5 Sigma $ALTS (no, that\u2019s not a key on your computer keyboard) to sell $750 million of World Liberty\u2019s $WLFI coin. ALT5 Sigma will finance the purchase by selling $1.5 billion of its own shares and will give an undisclosed number of those shares to the Trumps\u2019 World Liberty. Eric Trump will join ALT5 Sigma\u2019s board. Emulating what firms like Strategy have done with Bitcoin, the concept here is that shares in ALT5 are a kind of proxy for the $WLFI coin.\n- Hold the bacon: Meanwhile World Liberty\u2019s $USD1.X coin has generated some $4.5 billion for the firm\u2019s owners, largely through trading on a platform called PancakeSwap, which the Wall Street Journal reports was created by employees at big-league crypto exchange Binance $BNB.X. Binance\u2019s majority owner and founder, Changpeng Zhao, reported to be worth more than $70 billion, recently hired a friend of Donald Trump Jr. to push for a pardon. Zhao spent 4 months in jail last year, and Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines after a federal court found the platform had become a money-laundering hub for terrorists and sanctions evaders.\n- AriZona Iced Tea and the demise of the 99-cent can: Since 1997, AriZona Iced Tea $99CENTS.X has kept the price of its signature tall boy 22-ounce can at 99 cents. Its stock ticker symbol is even \u201c99Cents\u201d. Keeping up with inflation would have raised the price to $1.99, but founder and owner Dan Vultaggio, who grew up in Brooklyn where his dad managed an A&P supermarket, told the New York Times he\u2019s long believed in three principles: \u201cMake it taste good, make it look good, and price it right.\u201d But the Trump tariffs on imported aluminum may upend his strategy. While 80% of the aluminum used in his cans comes from recycled U.S. material, 20% comes from Canada, subjected to a 50% import duty.\n- Canadian Gentlemen Prefer Hane\u2019s: Montreal-based apparel maker Gildan Activewear $GIL will buy Hanesbrands $HBI , the North Carolina-based underwear maker, for $2.2 billion, in one of the first Canadian acquisitions of a U.S. company since President Trump slapped 35% tariffs on all Canadian imports. The two firms both use mostly U.S. cotton in their clothing, so tariffs would have a minimal effect on their business\n- Disspirited: Budget airline Spirit $SAVEQ emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, but budget flyers are not flocking to its bright yellow birds, and the company said there\u2019s \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d it can keep going for the next 12 months. In February, Spirit rejected a bid from Frontier Airlines. Last year, JetBlue and Spirit called off a planned merger after anti-trust regulators said the larger airline would reduce competition.\nGet Big Business This Week in your inbox every week\u2014and read it before everybody else!

That\u2019s what Elon Musk is alleging, saying that after Apple partnered last year with OpenAI to put its AI chatbot into its products, Musk\u2019s own AI agent, Grok is being shut out of the top ranks at the App Store. \u201dApple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,\u201d Musk alleged. \u201cWhy do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your \u2018Must Have\u2019 section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps? Are you playing politics?\u201d Musk asked in a second post. (Apple didn\u2019t comment directly). Musk is locked in a bitter feud with OpenAI founder Sam Altman, whom he sued last year for turning the company into a for-profit machine (Musk co-founded OpenAI withAltman in 2015). Altman snapped right back at Musk: \u201cThis is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn\u2019t like,\u201d Altman retorted on X. Their feud continues: On Tuesday, Musk lost his bid to dismiss a lawsuit from OpenAi claiming he\u2019s been waging a \u201cyears long harassment campaign\u201d using social media, press statements legal claims (see above), and \u201ca sham bid for OpenAI\u2019s assets.\u201d A jury trial is scheduled for this spring.\n- The Singularity is coming: Altman is clearly unwilling to let the rivalry drop. The Financial Post of Canada reports that Altman is preparing to start a new company funded by OpenAI to create its own human brain-AI interface. The firm, Merger Labs, will go head-to-head (or implant-to-implant, if you prefer) with Musk\u2019s Neuralink.\n- Pass on Gas: In Memphis, where Musk has built a massive data center to power Grok, locals are protesting the pollution from 35 un-permitted temporary gas turbines. A University of Tennessee analysis found peak concentration levels of toxic nitrogen dioxide have increased by 79% since the data center opened, TIME magazine reports, creating a public health crisis. An xAI spokesperson wouldn\u2019t comment to Time, but the magazine says that at a new xAI site in nearby Whitehaven, Tennessee, 66 more gas turbines have been unboxed. We asked Grok: How toxic is AI? It responded: \u201cTraining large AI models consumes massive energy, contributing to carbon emissions. For instance, training a single large model can emit as much CO2 as a transatlantic flight.\u201d\nPeter S.

      "text": "Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll learn when you read this story:\n- Futurists have long debated the arrival of the singularity, when human and artificial intelligence will merge, a concept borrowed from the world of quantum physics.\n- American computer scientist and futurist Ray Kurzweil has long argued that the singularity would likely occur around the middle of the 21st century, and with the rise of AI, his predictions are gaining more credence.\n- In his book, The Singularity is Nearer, Kurzweil doubles down on those predictions and details how humanity\u2019s intelligence will increase a millionfold via nanobots (among other things).\nYou don\u2019t exactly become a world-renowned futurist by making safe predictions. And while some of these past predictions haven\u2019t exactly come to pass (Back to the Future Part II, specifically), these ideas help expand our thoughts on what exactly the future might look like.\nAnd no one makes futuristic predictions quite like Ray Kurzweil.\nAn American computer scientist-turned-futurist, Kurzweil has long believed that humanity is headed toward what\u2019s known as \u201cthe singularity,\u201d when man and machine merge. In 1999, Kurzweil theorized that artificial general intelligence would be achieved once humanity could achieve a technology capable of a trillion calculations per second, which he pegged to occur in 2029.\nExperts at the time scoffed at the idea, figuring it\u2019d be at least a century or more, but with Kurzweil\u2019s timeline only a few years off\u2014and talk of AGI spreading\u2014that decades-old prediction is beginning to loom large.\nIn his 2024 book, The Singularity is Nearer (a play on his 2005 book of the same name minus an \u201cer\u201d), Kurzweil doubles down on these ideas in the modern era of artificial intelligence. Not only is he \"sticking with [his] five years\u201d prediction, as he said in a TED Talk, Kurzweil also believes that humans will achieve a millionfold intelligence by 2045, aided by brain interfaces formed with nanobots non-invasively inserted into our capillaries.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be a combination of our natural intelligence and our cybernetic intelligence,\u201d Kurzweil said in an interview with The Guardian, \u201cand it\u2019s all going to be rolled into one. We are going to expand intelligence a millionfold by 2045, and it is going to deepen our awareness and consciousness.\u201d\nWhile this idea subscribes to a merger more akin to physical intervention to bridge the gap between man and machine, other philosophers and AI experts agree that some form of merger is likely inevitable, and in some ways, is already beginning. In July 2024, Oxford\u2019s Marcus du Sautoy and Nick Bostrom both expounded on the hopeful and harrowing possibilities of our AI future, and for both of them, a kind of synthesis appeared inevitable.\n\u201cI think that we are headed toward a hybrid future,\u201d Sautoy told Popular Mechanics. \u201cWe still believe that we are the only beings with a high level of consciousness. This is part of the whole Copernican journey that we are not unique. We\u2019re not at the center.\u201d\nOf course, this \u201cBrave New World\u201d of a hybrid AI-human existence brings with it a plethora of issues both political and personal. What will humans do for jobs? Could we possibly live forever? Would that change the very idea of what it means to be human?\nKurzweil, like many other futurists, is relatively optimistic on this front. In that same interview with The Guardian, Kurzweil highlights the idea of a Universal Basic Income as a necessity rather than a fringe idea currently supported in more progressive circles, and AI will bring unprecedented advancements in medicine, meaning the very idea of immortality isn\u2019t out of the realm of possibility.\n\u201cIn the early 2030s we can expect to reach longevity escape velocity where every year of life we lose through aging we get back from scientific progress,\u201d Kurzweil told The Guardian. \u201cAnd as we move past that, we\u2019ll actually get back more years. It isn\u2019t a solid guarantee of living forever\u2014there are still accidents\u2014but your probability of dying won\u2019t increase year to year.\u201d\nJust like Back to the Future Part II predicted flying cars, so too could these technology-fueled utopias crumble to dust as these dates inch closer and closer. But 25 years ago, Kurzweil predicted we\u2019d be rapidly approaching a major moment in humanity\u2019s technological history at the tail end of this decade.\nCurrently, no evidence suggests the contrary.\nDarren lives in Portland, has a cat, and writes/edits about sci-fi and how our world works.

      "text": "Nvidia, the world\u2019s most valuable company, has found itself caught in the middle of President Donald Trump\u2019s historic trade war with China. The result: an extraordinary concession from a $4.5 trillion corporation that will give the United States a percentage of every high-end AI chip sold in China.\nThe deal, which AMD also signed for some of its chips, could split the difference between two competing Trump administration goals: maintain America\u2019s AI dominance while securing a critical trade agreement with China. It could also give the White House billions of dollars to spend as it wishes.\nWhat Nvidia agreed to\nNvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues from semiconductor sales to China in exchange for licenses to export their technology there.\nThe White House in April blocked the export of certain AI chips to China, including Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips and AMD\u2019s MI308 chips. The deal with the Trump administration allows the companies to obtain export licenses to restart sales of those chips in China, a US official told CNN. The Financial Times first reported the story Sunday.\nNvidia previewed the deal last month, when it said it would resume sales of the H20 chip to China after the Trump administration expressed openness to allowing the export of certain AI chips again. But the 15% payment was a surprise. Trump said Nvidia was initially asked to pay a 20% cut, but they negotiated the rate down to 15%.\nThe deal came together after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, the official said. Although the export licenses were granted Friday, no shipments have yet been made.\n\u201cWe follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets,\u201d a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWhile we haven\u2019t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.\u201d\nAMD has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\nHow extraordinary is this?\nGovernments, including the United States, have taken control of companies in the past when they were considered to be of strategic importance to national security. During the financial crisis in 2009, the United States took control of General Motors and Chrysler, and the proceeds of those stakes went directly into the US Treasury after the government sold them for a profit.\nBut it\u2019s not clear that the US government has ever demanded a percentage of a company\u2019s business without taking an equity stake \u2013 or if it\u2019s even legal to do so.\nThe US Constitution forbids taxes on exports. To get around that, the deal\u2019s terms have been structured as a voluntary agreement, so it won\u2019t be considered a tax or a tariff, a US official said. Instead, Nvidia and AMD will voluntarily send funds to the US government. The companies will have no say whatsoever on how the US government deploys that money after it is sent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to identify any historical precedent for this sort of arrangement,\u201d said Sarah Kreps, law professor and director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University\u2019s Brooks School of Public Policy.\nWhat about national security?\nIn recent years, the US government has sought to restrict China\u2019s access to advanced American technology in an effort to slow its progress on AI and let the United States get farther ahead. But the White House\u2019s reversal on export controls may be an acknowledgement that China is advancing in AI regardless, so American companies might as well be allowed to benefit. It could also give the White House another way to raise revenue for the US government, along with tariffs.\n\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s been some vacillation within the administration about and toward China, and I think that reflects the internal divide within the administration between the China hawks and the economic pragmatists,\u201d Kreps said. \u201cIt seems like increasingly, the economic pragmatists are holding sway.\u201d\nThat approach would align with arguments from Nvidia\u2019s Huang, who has said that restricting sales of American AI chips is bad for US national security. Chinese developers could simply undermine US leadership by creating their own alternatives if they can\u2019t buy American technology, according to Huang, who has met with Trump repeatedly in recent months.\nThe White House agrees with Huang, believing it\u2019s better to have China locked into a US-made chip sold through legitimate channels than to force China to the black market, a US official said. China has been able to subvert existing channels to obtain restricted chips anyway.\nWhy is Trump charging 15%?\nBig questions remain about where the 15% commission idea emerged and what it could mean for national security.\nA US official said that the payment allows the administration to maintain control of the export process and bring in revenue for the US government in the process. Still, it\u2019s not clear that the penalty for Nvidia and AMD will effectively limit the flow of the chips or erase any potential national security issues.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a legitimate national security concern about exporting these chips to China, then I don\u2019t see how the payments to the US government address those risks. In fact, they don\u2019t at all,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cAnd if there\u2019s not a sufficient national security risk or they can be adequately mitigated \u2026 then the US government should just get out of the way and expect nothing in return.\u201d\nWhat does this mean for Nvidia?\nNvidia released the H20 chip last year as a way to maintain access to the Chinese market \u2014 which made up 13% of the company\u2019s sales in 2024 \u2014 in the face of US export controls imposed by the Biden administration.\nBut the chips are widely believed to have contributed to DeepSeek, an advanced Chinese AI model that shook Silicon Valley upon its release earlier this year, raising concerns that China was further ahead on AI than previously understood.\nAfter the Trump administration barred H20 sales to China in April, Nvidia said it took billions of dollars in charges and lost revenue because of the export controls in the first quarter and projected a similar outcome in the second quarter.\nSo, even if it has to fork over 15% of those sales to the White House, resuming shipments of the H20 to China could mean billions more dollars in revenue for Nvidia \u2014 which became the first publicly traded company to top $4 trillion in valuation last month. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) rose as much as 0.5% on Monday.\nCombined, Nvidia and AMD could earn as much as $35 billion in annual revenue from sales of their H20 and MI380 chips to China, according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino\u2019s estimates. That means the White House would earn around $5 billion in revenue. \u201cWe acknowledge the tax will have a negative impact on profit margins tied to China sales but view the reentry into the second-largest GPU market to be worth the cost,\u201d Zino said in emailed commentary Monday.\nHow important are these chips?\nTrump on Monday called Nvidia\u2019s H20 chip \u201cobsolete,\u201d saying that China \u201calready has it in a different form.\u201d\nBut some experts disagree with Trump\u2019s characterization of the chips.\n\u201cThese H20s are still state of the art,\u201d CSIS\u2019s Kennedy said. Although they\u2019re less advanced, in some ways, than other Nvidia chips, \u201cthey also come with elements that make them extremely sophisticated and valuable,\u201d including their memory capabilities.\nNvidia\u2019s H20 chip is also good at inference, says Param Singh, professor of business technologies and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University, which refers to the process an AI model goes through when answering a question.\nBut Nvidia\u2019s H100 and H200 series chips, as well as its Blackwell line of chips, are much more powerful and better equipped to train large language models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 he says. It\u2019s not the same as calling it obsolete, but using a chip like the H20 instead could mean it might take longer to train cutting edge AI models.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference in the amount of calculations that an H100 chip could do versus an H20,\u201d he said.\nNvidia likely reasoned that there is enough Chinese demand for the chips to make the 15% commission to the White House a worthwhile trade-off for its business, according to Kreps. \u201cYou have to do a calculation based on what was lost from the export controls,\u201d she said.\nWill Trump approve more advanced chips?\nTrump on Monday left open the possibility that Nvidia could export its super high-end Blackwell chips for a higher price. The Trump administration had closed the door on the export of that technology to China \u2014 even after reversing course on the H20.\nHowever, Trump on Monday said that he\u2019d consider allowing Nvidia to sell the Blackwell chip.\n\u201cThe Blackwell is superduper advanced. I wouldn\u2019t make a deal with that, although it\u2019s possible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019d make a deal a somewhat enhanced in a negative way. Blackwell, in other words, take 30% to 50% off of it, but that\u2019s the latest and the greatest in the world. Nobody has it. They won\u2019t have it for five years.\u201d\nTrump said Huang will return to the White House in the future to discuss selling an \u201cunenhanced\u201d version of Blackwell.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s coming to see me again about that, but that will be a unenhanced version of the big one,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know, we will sometimes sell fighter jets to a country and we\u2019ll give them 20% less than we have.\u201d\nWhat does China want?\nQuestions from Beijing about the security of American AI chips also raise uncertainty about just how successful Trump\u2019s commission policy could be.\nChina could choose not to buy US tech firm Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips, the social media account Yuyuan Tantian, which is affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV, said on Sunday. It claimed that the chips could have \u201cbackdoors\u201d that impact their function and security, following previous similar claims from China\u2019s cybersecurity administration. Nvidia has repeatedly denied that its products have backdoors.\nHowever, that statement could be less an indication that China won\u2019t buy American chips and more a signal to Chinese tech companies to continue innovating in semiconductors even if US shipments do resume, Kennedy said.\nWhat does this mean for a broader trade deal?\nFor the Trump administration, the cost-benefit analysis is that it opens up the flow of mid-tier chips to China while giving the administration a key bargaining chip in its ongoing trade talks, a US official said.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called Nvidia export controls a \u201cnegotiating chip\u201d in the larger US-China trade talks.\nBut China knows that, and its posturing over supposed security concerns with the H20 chip this weekend suggests that it won\u2019t be won over so easily \u2014 even if it wants the chips for its market.\nThis story has been updated with additional information and context."

      "text": "Five days after Elon Musk\u2019s Grok 4 became one of the most powerful large language models in the world, Alexis Humphreys had her first severe asthma attack in 15 years. She laid down in her house in Boxtown, Memphis in the humid, sticky summer, struggling to breathe, inhaling a smell of gas that had started wafting into her neighborhood about a year before. \u201cIt felt like my chest was caving in,\u201d Humphreys, 28, says on her front porch a couple of days later.\nEnvironmentalists and community activists say this is no coincidence. Boxtown, a predominantly Black community with a median income of $37,000, sits a few miles from where Musk, driven by ambitions of creating an AI smarter than humans, set up the self-proclaimed biggest supercomputer in the world last year. The supercomputer, named Colossus, consisted of a staggering 230,000 Nvidia GPUs, a sheer training power that allowed Musk to vault past his competitors in key benchmarks. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, another AI titan, praised Musk\u2019s rapid buildout of the site as \u201csuperhuman.\u201d\nBut all of those computers need a vast amount of energy to run. Fueling them has been 35 unpermitted temporary gas turbines, which have been pumping out a level of emissions that, according to environmentalists, is exacerbating the health issues of an area already crushed by decades of pollution.\nResearchers at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, at the request of TIME, ran an analysis on the air quality in South Memphis over the last couple of years, based on public satellite data from NASA and the European Space Agency. They found that average concentrations of nitrogen dioxide have increased by 3% when comparing the periods before June 2024 and afterward. They also found that peak nitrogen dioxide concentration levels have increased by 79% from pre-xAI levels in areas immediately surrounding the data center, and by 9% in nearby Boxtown.\nBecause high concentrations of air pollutants pose greater health risks than lower concentrations, the researchers said, focusing on these spikes\u2014rather than just averages\u2014offers more meaningful insight into potential health impacts. It\u2019s the first major effort to quantify the turbines\u2019 environmental impact using publicly available data.\n\u201cThese changes in pollutant concentrations likely reflect the combined influence of natural gas-fired emission sources in the area, including both the new xAI facility and the increased utilization of the Allen power plant,\u201d wrote Joshua Fu, a civil and environmental engineering professor, and Zhixu Sun, a PhD student.\nAustin Dalgo, an academic primary care physician in South Memphis, calls the jump in peak nitrogen dioxide concentration levels \u201calarming,\u201d and believes that they \u201csignificantly increase the risk to residents\u2019 health.\u201d The EPA writes that a high concentration of NO2 can aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthma.\n\u201cThe xAI turbines are leading to a public health crisis in Memphis by releasing nitrogen oxides\u2014pollutants known to directly harm the lungs,\u201d Dalgo tells TIME. \u201cThese emissions pose the greatest risk to our city\u2019s most vulnerable residents, including children, the elderly, and individuals with respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD.\u201d\nxAI\u2014and its boosters, such as the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce\u2014insisted the turbines were legal, generated negligible amounts of pollution, and were only temporary: they said in April that the units would be replaced with cleaner models featuring pollution controls, a change they later claimed was carried out this summer. Those upgrades, the company\u2019s local representative, Brent Mayo, told a permit hearing in April, would make xAI \u201cthe lowest-emitting facility in the country.\u201d (xAI did not respond to a request for comment for this story.)\nCommunity members believe that the damage is already done, and that xAI\u2019s approach sets a dangerous precedent for other companies to pollute without regulatory oversight, as long as they are doing so on a \u201ctemporary\u201d basis. In June, the NAACP sent an intent-to-sue notice to xAI for violating the Clean Air Act, arguing that the company failed to obtain the necessary permits or pollution controls for the turbines. But the lawsuit seems unlikely to get traction from President Donald Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which just shuttered the scientific research arm that analyzes environmental hazards.\nNow, Musk is building an even bigger data center at a different site a few miles away in Whitehaven, which he brags will be double the size\u2014and run on a power plant imported from overseas. In August, 66 more gas turbines paid for by an xAI subsidiary were delivered to that site, although it\u2019s unclear how they will be used.\nAI data centers are exploding in number across the country alongside Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan, released in July, which calls for the expediting of data center permitting by reducing regulations imposed by the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.\nAI boosters like Musk tend to talk about AI progress in global or even intergalactic terms. They say that powerful AIs will cure cancer, fight climate change, and turbocharge productivity. But their quest to transform humanity may be coming at the expense of actual people. \u201cOur lives and our lungs are being sacrificed on the altar of their capitalistic exploitation,\u201d says Justin Pearson, a Tennessee state representative for parts of Memphis, including Boxtown.\n\u201cImagine the outcry if these facilities had been placed next to St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, no one would allow it,\u201d says Dalgo. \u201cInstead, they were placed in the backyard of a historically Black, underserved neighborhood, reinforcing a long legacy of environmental racism in Memphis\u2014and our country.\u201d\nElon's Deal\nxAI\u2019s first Memphis data center sits on the banks of the Mississippi, a 15-minute drive from downtown. To the casual observer, there\u2019s little that distinguishes it visually from the other facilities in the heavily-industrialized area, which include a power plant, a wastewater plant, and a steel manufacturer. But it\u2019s clear something substantial is happening inside: the ground hums with activity, and from the road outside the fences, air above its turbines appears to glitch and flicker as they pump out fumes.\nAI is America\u2019s newest big industry\u2014and Elon Musk is intent on controlling its most powerful systems. Driven by fears of what would happen if AGI (artificial general intelligence) were to be developed in the wrong hands, Musk has plowed billions of dollars into developing the technology. But his first big bet in the space\u2014on the young entrepreneur Sam Altman and OpenAI\u2014ended in a bitter breakup.\nMusk publicly questioned whether Altman could be trusted with AGI, and started building his own rival project: xAI, which he announced in 2023. At that point, Musk was several years behind his competitors. He needed to find a location to quickly start training his AI, with as ample energy and water\u2014and as little red tape\u2014as possible.\nMusk found a willing partner in Memphis, a city with deep economic challenges. In 2024, Shelby County, where Memphis sits, led the nation in population decline. And because Tennessee does not collect income tax\u2014which it repealed in 2021\u2014its governments are reliant on businesses coming to the state to pay property taxes.\n\u201cProperty taxes are the mother's milk of how government is funded,\u201d says Bobby White, chief government affairs officer at the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce. \u201cAnd we have not, historically, had people tripping over themselves to get to Memphis. We have to go get it out of the mud.\u201d\nIn 2024, xAI came calling about a large, vacant manufacturing lot: a former Electrolux plant, which had arrived in 2013 with $188 million in subsidies, promising good, long-term jobs. But six years later, the company announced it would close shop and lay off 500 employees, marking yet another corporate letdown for the city. \u201cMemphis is a cash cow for everybody but us,\u201d says Orion Overstreet, a Memphis college student and activist. \u201cIt has always been a very extractive story, where we get stuck as the dumping ground for corporations.\u201d\nThe Electrolux site seemed ideal to xAI: in an industrial zone, proximate to a power plant and a wastewater facility. When xAI inquired about the site, and didn\u2019t ask for property tax abatements, many politicians and local agencies were elated. The scope of the project meant that it was projected to generate an estimated $25 million or more in property taxes for Memphis during every year of operation.\nSo xAI forged ahead quietly and quickly, signing NDAs with key players, including Memphis Gas Light and Water (MGLW). Memphis Council Member Yolanda Cooper-Sutton says she heard about the project on the news. The data center was built in a matter of months, with xAI insiders calling it \u201cthe largest AI datacenter on the planet.\u201d\nMusk was ready to train his AI Grok in Memphis, but there was just one problem: MGLW couldn\u2019t provide nearly enough power for Musk\u2019s needs. In August 2024, MGLW said that xAI would have access to 50 megawatts of power. But xAI wanted to use triple that amount: enough energy to power 80,000 households.\nSo he brought in 35 methane gas turbines, which had a combined generating capacity of 421 megawatts, comparable to entire Tennessee power plants. Based on manufacturer-supplied emissions data, these turbines have the potential to emit between 1,200 and 2,000 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx) a year, which would eclipse the output of the Memphis airport.\nIn April, Memphis Mayor Paul Young, who has been supportive of the project, said that the turbines were only there as a backup power source, and only 15 of them were in use. But environmentalists used thermal imaging and found heat coming off of 33 of the 35 turbines. The turbines, based on their visual makes, did not appear to be equipped with emissions control technology, says Amanda Garcia, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, which represents NAACP in its legal actions against xAI.\n\u201cThese 35 turbines: we have never seen anything like this in Memphis or elsewhere,\u201d says Garcia. \u201cThey essentially set up a power plant without getting a permit.\u201d\nA representative for Mayor Young did not make him available for comment.\nThe Boxtown Resistance\nEaster Knox, 76, started smelling gas in the air last year, and stopped opening her windows. \u201cIt smells like rotten cabbage early in the morning,\u201d Knox says, three miles down from the data center. \u201cIt\u2019s been a struggle, breathing this little air that\u2019s coming through.\u201d\nKnox knows all too well that Memphis\u2019s air wasn\u2019t exactly clean before xAI arrived. Shelby County received an F from the American Lung Association\u2019s most recent State of the Air\u2019s ozone report. The city ranks second in the nation in terms of asthma-related ED visits in the nation and seventh in asthma-related deaths. And the city\u2019s ozone levels regularly exceed national minimum air quality standards.\nBoxtown, where Knox has lived for five decades, has been particularly crushed. Once a community for freed slaves after the Civil War, corporations flocked to the area in the 20th century to set up giant industrial plants. In the 1940s, the U.S. military came to South-Central Memphis and disposed of waste such as oil, grease, and paint thinners into the soil; decades later, it was declared a superfund site. A Sterilization Services of Tennessee facility was finally closed last year after emitting ethylene oxide into the air for decades, which the EPA linked to increased cancer risk in South Memphis. A 2013 study found that Southwest Memphis\u2019s cancer rate is four times the national average.\nKnox\u2019s family is represented in those cruel statistics: Her father and brother died from cancer, which she believes was related to the nearby Valero oil refinery. Knox was diagnosed with COPD last year, and her husband, Starrie, also suffered from asthma and COPD before dying in June from cancer. \u201cWe are the last of the forgotten out here,\u201d she says.\nAs Knox sits under a shaded pavilion in Boxtown on a July afternoon, the air is stifling: glasses fog up in the humidity, and the metal weights on a communal bench press scald to the touch. Though some houses in the neighborhood are crumbling, there are also plenty of signs of community care around her, in the form of flower beds and shady places to sit. \u201cIt\u2019s God's given air, and man shouldn\u2019t take it away from us,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t care how much money you got.\u201d\nAs Knox talks, a crowd gathers and nods in assent, offering their own stories of decades of trauma and neglect.\n\u201cI got a lot of relatives, my mother and father, buried up there at my church with breathing problems, cancer, lung problems,\u201d says Willie Joseph Stafford, an 80-year-old lifelong Boxtown resident. \u201cNobody seems to care about what's causing it and what we can do to solve it. Instead of them trying to do that, they come out here and put more pollution on us.\u201d\nFor Musk, the Electrolux plant was simply a good deal. To the residents of Boxtown, it was another threat upon their lungs. Gas turbines release smog-forming pollution and hazardous chemicals like formaldehyde\u2014which are tied to increases in asthma, respiratory diseases, heart problems, and certain cancers. People who already have respiratory issues are at greater health risk to any increase in pollution.\nDalgo, who works at several clinics within 15 miles of the data center, says he sees many patients with breathing issues. \u201cI\u2019m pretty surprised at how many people come in with respiratory problems, or need an inhaler to get around day-to-day without having wheezing symptoms,\u201d he says. \u201cI think their respiratory issues are being exacerbated because they're experiencing high levels of nitrogen oxides \u2026 I wouldn't be surprised if some of the respiratory issues that I've seen are directly related to the tonnes of nitrogen oxides that are being put in the air by these turbines.\u201d\nIn April, hundreds of people showed up to a public hearing held by the Shelby County Health Department over xAI\u2019s air permit for permanent turbines, and voiced their complaints one by one. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we breathe at home?\u201d Humphreys asked at the meeting.\nPublic outcry has continued. On one Tuesday evening in July, about 75 protesters gathered by the student coalition Tigers Against Pollution marched in front of the Shelby County Health Department, holding signs that read \u201cElon XiPloits\u201d and \u201cour lungs / our lives / NOT FOR SALE.\u201d\nOne of the marchers was Christian Dennis, a 22-year-old South Memphian whose grandmother died of cancer, despite not smoking or drinking her whole life. \u201cThey call us anti-business extremists,\u201d he says. \u201cTo receive that reaction simply from wanting clean air, wanting equal health opportunities\u2014It just tells you a lot about people.\u201d\nThe protest garnered support from passing cars. A fire truck drove by and honked its deafening horn, with firefighters holding up fists. When a Tesla Cybertruck\u2014which has effectively become a symbol of Musk himself\u2014stopped alongside the protest, protestors began jeering. But then the driver rolled down his window and leaned toward the crowd. \u201cI\u2019m on your side!\u201d he shouted, before driving away.\nPower and Promises\nBoxtown residents and protesters are making a lot of noise. But they\u2019re running up against the city\u2019s power players\u2014most notably the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce, which helped bring xAI to the city. \u201cWe're seeing something pretty magnificent happen that is going to be tremendously beneficial to the city,\u201d Bobby White, the Chamber\u2019s government affairs officer, told TIME at the Chamber\u2019s offices downtown.\nWhen you walk into the Chamber and turn right, the first thing you see is xAI\u2019s logo: the main conference room is emblazoned with the title \u201cxAI Digital Delta Center\u201d in big, frosted lettering. White explains that while the Chamber used to be primarily funded by the government, it now relies on private funding\u2014and xAI has become its biggest investor in short order. \u201cWe do sponsorships. You can put your name on the wall, too,\u201d he says.\nWhite is keen to list the reasons why xAI will uplift Memphis. xAI\u2019s property taxes will inject millions into public projects to beautify the city and fix infrastructure, he says. Musk has agreed to supply Tesla Megapack batteries that will help fortify the grid during periods of peak demand to safeguard from blackouts. xAI\u2019s presence in the area is bringing other companies to an area that desperately needs jobs and investment. And the company has agreed to finance renovations for four schools near their data centers.\nAnother key potential benefit involves water. Data centers use a vast amount of water to cool their computers, sometimes drawing from the local drinking supply. When xAI moved to Memphis, water activists became concerned that the company would try to draw from the aquifer that sits below the city and contains some of the purest water in the country.\nInstead, Musk started work on an $80 million wastewater plant down the road from his facility, which would treat sewer water and repurpose it for xAI\u2019s uses. Crucially, other nearby entities, including the Tennessee Valley Authority and Nucor Steel, have agreed to use it once it\u2019s ready, taking them off the aquifer. Sarah Houston, the executive director of the nonprofit Protect Our Aquifer, calls the treatment plant a \u201chuge step in the right direction\u201d towards protecting the drinking water of Memphis.\nHouston, however, remains wary of the project\u2019s future. \u201cBuilding infrastructure for the oligarchy is a really scary path to start walking,\u201d Houston says. \u201cIf xAI folds and leaves, how do we ensure this facility continues to operate? Public interest should not be based on profits. It should be based on our core needs, one of which is clean drinking water.\u201d\nBut those in power are attempting to convince Boxtown residents that xAI's presence will actually benefit them most. Mayor Young has proposed an ordinance that 25% of xAI\u2019s property taxes go straight to infrastructure improvements within five miles of its data centers. The ordinance, the mayor told Memphis council members, would help \u201cbring back dignity\u201d to Boxtown and nearby communities, financing potholes, street repair, home repairs, and social services. It is slowly working its way through the city council process this summer.\nSome Boxtown community members are pacified by this idea. But Representative Justin Pearson is not one of them. \u201cThere's no amount of money that can persuade me to accept pollution killing me and my family,\u201d he says. He likens the funding to a bribe, and contends the community has not been given legitimate input into how the money might be allocated.\nHe adds that Boxtown should not have to sacrifice its air quality for fundamental services like getting its trash picked up and its potholes filled. \u201cIt is sickening that the only way we're going to be able to get any financial benefits from our government is by accepting the death-dealing pollution, xAI plant tax,\u201d he says.\nOther community members say that past projects have offered similar promises, only for them to not pan out. \u201cWhen someone says that this percentage of tax revenue will go to this thing, it\u2019s hard to trust that, because it hasn\u2019t in the past,\u201d says Amber Sherman, a Memphis policy organizer.\nDebating the Data\nAs xAI\u2019s defenders stress its potential benefits, they also contend that the environmental criticisms are overblown. White, for instance, argues that there\u2019s no evidence xAI is doing anything \u201cthat is not legally, or in terms of existing policy, allowable.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe have folks who will go to these community meetings and complain about temporary gas turbines, half of which have already disappeared, and they'll be driving a car that\u2019s smoking, looking like they're cooking barbecue in the back.\u201d\nThere have been no significant studies on the turbines\u2019 impact on Memphis air quality. Proper air quality testing is expensive and requires rigorous reporting over a long period of time. It is also exceedingly hard to pinpoint xAI\u2019s exact impact, given the many other industrial facilities in the area.\nMost relevant governmental agencies have avoided looking into the turbines\u2019 impact in a meaningful way. The Shelby County Health Department said the turbines, because they were temporary, fell under the oversight of the EPA. (In July, its director Michelle Taylor announced she was leaving the job for a Baltimore post.) An EPA spokesperson said in July that the agency was working with the local health department to review concerns.\nThe health department subsequently approved xAI\u2019s permit request for 15 permanent gas turbines, which it said would be used strictly as backup, and said that the temporary turbines were fine as long as they were removed within a year. They added that the permanent turbines would have state-of-the-art emissions control which would make their health impacts negligible.\nThe City of Memphis tried to assuage concerns by commissioning its own study, which found the air in Boxtown and Whitehaven was safe. But some air quality experts raised questions about the study\u2019s methodology, which only took readings from three locations over two 12-hour periods, and placed monitors underneath buildings in a way that may not have conformed with EPA guidance. \u201cMost importantly, the monitors did not even measure one of the most important air pollutants at issue here, which is ozone or smog,\u201d says Garcia of the SELC.\nIn April, University of Memphis professor Chunrong Jia declared that, based on his modeling, the turbines did not threaten local air quality, but conceded that there was \u201chuge uncertainty\u201d around the modeling process, especially because it was based on data provided by xAI rather than on independent air monitoring. Jia did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn July, Memphis Communities Against Pollution, a group led by Justin Pearson\u2019s brother KeShaun, announced that it was conducting its own $250,000 study to install nine air quality monitoring devices in the city. Pearson says a full report from the study will likely be available in September.\nMeanwhile, TIME asked researchers at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville to run an analysis of the air quality in South Memphis based on publicly available data from satellites: NASA\u2019s TEMPO instrument, and ESA\u2019s Tropomi. After screening for cloud cover, outliers, and using de-weathering techniques, they found \u201cdistinct temporal patterns across pollutants following the commencement of xAI facility operations.\u201d When adjusted for meteorological variability, they found that nitrogen dioxide jumped by 3% in the post-xAI period, with peak episodes observed in late 2024.\n\u201cThese findings suggest that emissions from the xAI data center and associated transportation activities may be contributing to air quality changes in ZIP code 38109,\u201d wrote Joshua Fu and Zhixu Sun in their analysis.\nThe researchers also found that the concentration levels of nitrogen dioxide hit far higher peaks after the turbines moved in, with the maximum value of hourly NASA data increasing by 79% compared to that of the pre-xAI period. \u201cSince high concentrations of air pollutants pose far greater health risks than lower concentrations, focusing on peak values or upper-percentile concentrations provides more meaningful insight when evaluating potential health impacts,\u201d Sun wrote.\nThe researchers noted that some of those emissions may be coming from the TVA power plant nearby. But TVA allocated 150 megawatts\u2014about 13% of the plant\u2019s capacity\u2014to xAI in 2024, according to data the researchers reviewed from the Energy Information Administration. They also noted that motor vehicles may have contributed to the rise in nitrogen dioxide.\nA High Pain Threshold\nxAI is currently building out a second location just a few miles away, in Whitehaven, which will be double the size of the first one, with 550,000 Nvidia GPUs. The site needs so much power that Musk may be shipping a power plant from overseas. While Musk has talked about the importance of \u201cmaximum transparency,\u201d details around the site\u2019s power, water and environmental impact are essentially unknown. In August, the Memphis newspaper Commercial Appeal found in SEC filings that an xAI subsidiary had paid for 66 natural gas turbines, and had them delivered to the Whitehaven site.\nMusk says his goal is to bring the equivalent of 50 million NVIDIA supercomputers online within five years. The result of all this power? The ever-increasing capability of xAI\u2019s large language model Grok, which X users now look to as a source of truth. In July, Grok 4 outperformed its rivals on many benchmarks, most notably math-problem solving. In the same month, Grok also referred to itself as \u201cMechaHitler,\u201d made anti-semitic statements, and gave TIME instructions to make fentanyl. Concurrently, xAI announced a contract with the U.S. Defense Department worth up to $200 million to develop tech tools for America\u2019s military.\nMusk\u2019s acceleration is only spurring forward his competitors to build their own data centers, too\u2014and the Trump administration is cheering them on. The EPA\u2019s leader, Lee Zeldin, wrote in Fox News that he wants to \u201cclear the way for data center and AI development across the U.S.\u201d In March, Zeldin announced that he, with the assistance of Musk\u2019s DOGE, had slashed more than $2 billion in EPA funding.\nThis posture from the EPA makes it unlikely they will take action against the NAACP\u2019s imminent lawsuit against xAI\u2019s turbines. Abre\u2019 Conner, the director of the Center for Environmental and Climate Justice at the NAACP, sees xAI\u2019s Memphis conflict as part of a much larger struggle. \u201cFor decades, we know that the decision to place more pollution in certain communities has disproportionately impacted Black communities and other frontline communities,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd now with the data center boom, many are looking at places that have already been considered sacrifice zones.\u201d\nMusk hasn\u2019t responded to the community complaints in Memphis. As always, he has his eye on the horizon, and beyond: He\u2019s talked extensively about the importance of having a \u201chigh pain threshold\u201d in business in pursuit of lofty goals. Maybe Grok, if powerful enough, will indeed help us \u201cunderstand the true nature of the universe.\u201d\nBut Justin Pearson and other Boxtown community members see Musk as just the latest in a long line of extractive figures, who think they can treat Memphis like pawns on a chessboard. \u201cWe are hurting and dying from these illnesses, and so the way that they came in tells us everything about what they think about us,\u201d he says. \u201cThey do not care.\u201d\nThis story was supported by Tarbell Grants.\nPierce Robinson contributed to this reporting."

      "text": "DANIA BEACH, Fla., Feb. 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Spirit Airlines, Inc. (\"Spirit\" or the \"Company\") today provided an update on its restructuring process regarding a new proposal (the \"New Proposal\") for an alternative restructuring plan submitted by Frontier Group Holdings, Inc. (\"Frontier\"), the parent company of Frontier Airlines, Inc.\nOn Feb. 4, 2025, Frontier submitted the New Proposal to Spirit. Under the terms of the New Proposal, which was subject to various conditions, Spirit's stakeholders would receive $400 million principal amount of second-lien debt issued by Frontier and 19.0% of Frontier's common equity following the proposed combination. The New Proposal would not require the Company to complete its previously announced $350 million equity rights offering, and required a waiver of the Bankruptcy Court-approved $35 million termination fee that would otherwise be owed under the Backstop Commitment Agreement, dated Nov. 18, 2024, by and among the Company and the other stakeholders party thereto (the \"Backstop Commitment Agreement\"). Notably, the New Proposal did not address certain material risks and issues previously identified by the Company, including that the New Proposal would deliver less in value to the Company's stakeholders than contemplated by the Company's existing plan of reorganization, is uncertain as to timing and completion, would result in extended and materially more costly and uncertain chapter 11 proceedings, and has uncertainties with regard to needed regulatory and court approvals. The Company's management and Board of Directors, consistent with their fiduciary duties, carefully reviewed the New Proposal in consultation with the Company's external legal and financial advisors.\nOn Feb. 4, 2025, as required by the Restructuring Support Agreement dated Nov. 18, 2024, by and among the Company, certain of its subsidiaries and the Consenting Stakeholders (as defined therein), the Company shared the New Proposal with the advisors for certain holders of the Company's (i) 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the holders, the \"Senior Secured Noteholders\") and (ii) 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the holders, the \"2025 Convertible Noteholders\") and 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the holders, together with the 2025 Convertible Noteholders, the \"Convertible Noteholders\").\nOn Feb. 6, 2025, the Company entered into confidentiality agreements (collectively, the \"NDAs\") with certain Senior Secured Noteholders and Convertible Noteholders (the \"NDA Parties\"). Pursuant to the NDAs, the Company shared Frontier's New Proposal with the NDA Parties.\nOn Feb. 7, 2025, Spirit submitted a counterproposal to Frontier (the \"Spirit Counterproposal\"). The aggregate value of the debt ($600 million) and equity ($1.185 billion) to be provided to Spirit stakeholders under the Spirit Counterproposal was equal to the amount of value that Frontier claimed it was providing to Spirit stakeholders under Frontier's New Proposal; the Spirit Counterproposal proposed market-based mechanisms to determine the amount of the equity in the combined company equity proposed for Spirit stakeholders. The Spirit Counterproposal would not require the Company to complete its previously announced equity rights offering but would require Frontier to pay the $35 million termination fee that would otherwise be owed under the Backstop Commitment Agreement.\nOn Feb. 10, 2025, Frontier rejected the Spirit Counterproposal in its entirety and reiterated the Feb. 4 New Proposal.\nSpirit will continue swiftly to advance and conclude its restructuring process, which will significantly deleverage the Company and position it for long-term success. The hearing to consider confirmation of Spirit's plan of reorganization is currently scheduled for Feb. 13, 2025 at 10am EST. Approximately 99.99% of all voting creditors have voted to accept the plan, and all but two objections have already been resolved. The Company expects to complete the restructuring in the first quarter of 2025.\nCertain communications and other materials exchanged between Spirit and Frontier and their advisors, related to the New Proposal and Spirit Counterproposal, can be found on Spirit's Investor Relations website at https://ir.spirit.com/events-and-presentations.\nAdditional information about the Company's chapter 11 case, including access to Court filings and other documents related to the restructuring process, is available at https://dm.epiq11.com/SpiritGoForward or by calling Spirit's restructuring information line at (888) 863-4889 (U.S. toll free) or +1 (971) 447-0326 (international). Additional information is also available at www.SpiritGoForward.com.\nAdvisors\nDavis Polk & Wardwell LLP is serving as the Company's restructuring counsel, Alvarez & Marsal is serving as restructuring advisor, and Perella Weinberg Partners LP is acting as investment banker.\nAkin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP is acting as legal counsel and Evercore is acting as financial advisor to the ad hoc group of loyalty noteholders.\nPaul Hastings LLP is acting as legal counsel and Ducera Partners LLC is acting as financial advisor to the convertible bondholders.\nAbout Spirit Airlines\nSpirit Airlines is a leading low-fare carrier committed to delivering the best value in the sky by offering an enhanced travel experience with flexible, affordable options.
