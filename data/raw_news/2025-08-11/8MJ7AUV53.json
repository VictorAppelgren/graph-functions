  "content": "Economist Peter Schiff is sounding the alarm on a potential merger of mortgage finance giants, the Federal National Mortgage Association FNMA or Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp FMCC, popularly known as Freddie Mac.\n\nAccording to Schiff, this merger could set the stage for risks that surpass those leading up to the Great Financial Crisis in 2008.\n\nSchiff argues that merging Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into a single company would effectively create a monopoly in the U.S. mortgage market.\n\nOne that he says can \u201cleverage an explicit\u201d government guarantee, which turns \u201crisky mortgages into U.S. treasuries.\u201d Here, Schiff is referring to the fact that government guaranteeing mortgages could result in them having the same creditworthiness as Treasuries.\n\nSee Also: Housing Market Has One Big Problem\u2014Mortgage Rates Are Still Too High\n\nAccording to Schiff, such a setup will lead to a \u201cmoral hazard\u201d far greater than what existed prior to the Great Financial Crisis of 2008.\n\nTrump Hints At Unified \u201cMAGA\u201d Listing For Fannie And Freddie\n\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump hinted at the possibility of merging the two government-sponsored companies, before listing them under the ticker symbol \u201cMAGA.\u201d\n\nUnlike Schiff, hedge fund manager, Bill Ackman has backed the move, saying that the resulting cost synergies of the merged institution can help lower mortgage rates.\n\n\u201cA merger would also reduce the cost and risks of government oversight as there would be only one institution that would require FHFA oversight. I suspect that this is @realDonaldTrump\u2019s idea as implied by his post below. It\u2019s a really good one,\u201d Ackman said in a post on X.\n\nAckman, whose Pershing Square Holdings has been the largest common stockholder in both companies for over 13 years, has been advocating for an end to their Federal conservatorship for the past several months.\n\nHe\u2019s also called for the cancellation of $348 billion in Senior Preferred Stock (SPS) liability on the balance sheets of both companies, calling it a \u201cfictitious\u201d figure that distorts economic realities.\n\nShares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were surging on Monday, trading up by 15.07% and 13.16%, at $11.49 and $9.03, respectively, following news of a historic public offering.",

      "text": "Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is advocating for Fannie Mae FNMA and Freddie Mac FMCC to exit federal conservatorship, a status they've held since the 2008 financial crisis, arguing it would benefit the U.S. housing finance system.\nWhat Happened: In a detailed post on X, Ackman, whose Pershing Square has been the largest common stockholder of both companies for 13 years, specifically calls for the cancellation of the $348.2 billion Senior Preferred Stock (SPS) liability on the companies' balance sheets, labeling it a \"fictitious\" figure that distorts economic reality.\nA federal conservatorship refers to a legal process where a government agency takes control of a private entity, typically a financial institution, to stabilize it, protect its stakeholders, and ensure it can continue to operate during a crisis. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been in conservatorship since 2008.\n\u201cWe believe that F2\u2019s exit from conservatorship will enable the GSEs (Government-Sponsored Enterprises) to operate more successfully and efficiently, with more stable management and at lower cost, greatly benefiting our housing finance system,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, an SPS liability mandates a company to prioritize payments to the senior preferred stockholder, the U.S. Treasury, in this case, over other stakeholders.\nAckman claims the government has been overpaid, stating, \"F2 repaid $301 billion of the original $191 billion invested by the government,\" generating an 11.6% return for taxpayers.\nAccording to him, the SPS balance, inflated by the Obama-era 2012 Net Worth Sweep, which siphoned all profits to the Treasury, preventing the companies from achieving their full market value.\n\"The government has been paid more than it was contractually owed under the extremely onerous terms of the SPS,\" Ackman asserts, emphasizing that canceling this liability isn't a gift to shareholders but a necessary correction.\nWhy It Matters: The move would also benefit taxpayers, highlights Ackman, as the government holds a 79.9% stake in Fannie and Freddie via warrants, ensuring significant returns on any value increase post-conservatorship.\nAckman warns, \"No private sector investor will invest in F2 if the government can unilaterally revise the terms of F2's liabilities at will,\" underscoring the need for trust in the market.\nThus, he believes that releasing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from conservatorship and canceling their SPS liability will enable them to operate more efficiently, reduce costs, and stabilize the housing finance system, ultimately benefiting the housing market.\nPrice Action: The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Invesco QQQ Trust ETF QQQ, which track the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 index, respectively, rose on Tuesday. The SPY was up 0.57% at $596.09, while the QQQ advanced 0.78% to $527.30, according to Benzinga Pro data.\nThe futures of the S&P 500, Dow Jones and the Nasdaq 100 indices were flat on Wednesday.\nRead Next:\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nPhoto courtesy: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

This shift could potentially expand the mortgage market to approximately five million first-time buyers, further underscoring the potential impact of the proposed merger.\nREAD MORE:\nImage via Shutterstock\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Get in before Q3 trades take off \u2192\nShares of Fannie Mae FNMA and Freddie Mac FMCC are surging in Monday morning trading, building on momentum from late last week. Here\u2019s what investors need to know.\nWhat To Know: The primary catalyst for the rally is a report revealing the Trump administration is seriously considering a plan to sell a portion of its stake in Fannie Mae and its counterpart, Freddie Mac.\nThis move would begin the process of returning the companies to the private sector after more than a decade and a half of government conservatorship, which began during the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe proposed plan, as detailed in reports on Friday, could involve selling between 5% and 15% of the government\u2019s holdings, potentially raising up to $200 billion in what would be one of the largest stock offerings in history. Six major Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, have presented frameworks for the public offering.\nThe initiative has found a vocal supporter in hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who has long argued for recapitalizing the entities. He noted recently that the companies are now well-capitalized and significantly safer than they were pre-crisis.\nWhile the government would retain majority control for the time being, the offering is seen as a critical step toward privatization.\nThis news comes against a backdrop of strengthening consumer confidence in the housing market. Last Thursday, Fannie Mae published its July 2025 National Housing Survey results, which showed the Home Purchase Sentiment Index rose 2.0 points to 71.8.\nThe combination of a potential concrete path toward privatization and positive underlying market sentiment is fueling significant investor optimism for the stock.\nPrice Action: According to data from Benzinga Pro, FNMA shares are trading higher by 17% to $11.55 Monday morning. The stock has a 52-week high of $11.91 and a 52-week low of $1.08.\nFMCC shares are meanwhile higher by 14.7% to $9.15. The stock has a 52-week high of $9.25 and a 52-week low of $1.04.\nRead Also: Trump\u2019s Tariff Storm Could Soon Hit American Consumers: Here\u2019s Why\nHow To Buy FNMA Stock\nBy now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Federal National Mortgage \u2013 be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.\nBuying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy \u201cfractional shares,\u201d which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share.\nIf you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u201cgo short\u201d a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading \u2013 either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.\nThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Get in before Q3 trades take off \u2192\nMortgage giants Fannie Mae FNMA and Freddie Mac FMCC may be on the path out of government conservatorship, as a new report builds on earlier signals from President Donald Trump about plans to return the firms to public ownership.\nWhat Happened: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under government conservatorship since the 2008 financial crisis, and their true value has remained a subject of debate among policymakers and investors like Bill Ackman in the years since.\nA new Wall Street Journal report says the Trump administration is preparing to sell a portion of the stakes held in the two mortgage giants.\nThe report stated that the government could sell 5% to 15% of its stock in the companies and raise approximately $30 billion. The two companies are valued at around $500 billion in the latest report.\nThe two companies bundle and sell mortgages and, under government ownership, rely on government-backed guarantees for loans to protect investors from losses.\nWhile many believe that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conducting a share offering would end the government conservatorship, Federal Housing Finance Agency head Bill Pulte has in the past suggested the two companies could remain under government control while public, without providing details of this plan.\nAnother unknown detail is whether the companies will be treated as a single entity in the share offering or as two separate companies.\nMeetings have been conducted about the future of Fannie and Freddie, with the CEOs of six of the largest US banks present, along with Trump, Pulte, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nThe six US banks represented were Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.\nThere is no guarantee that a share offering will happen, as hopes to take the company public come with question marks on whether the mortgage companies would keep the government-backed guarantees. Trump previously said that he wants the companies to maintain the guarantee through a public offering.\nWithout the government guarantee, there is a risk that mortgage rates could rise.\nThe Treasury Department currently owns senior preferred shares in both companies and warrants to purchase around 80% of the common stock in each company.\nWhy It's Important: Trump expressed interest in taking the mortgage companies public earlier this year.\nSupporters of the plan believe this could be one of the largest stock offerings in history.\nProceeds from the share offering could be used to reduce America's debt, returned to taxpayers, or used to buy Bitcoin BTC/USD for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, depending on who you ask.\nHedge funder Ackman said earlier this year that the government's stake in Fannie and Freddie was likely worth $300 billion. Ackman said the government was not willing to give up its ownership and control.\nAckman was short both Fannie and Freddie during the 2008 financial crisis before years later becoming a strong supporter of the companies. The investor has argued that the two companies are well-capitalized and far safer than they were before the financial crisis.\nPrice Action: Fannie Mae shares are up 18.1% to $9.80 on Friday versus a 52-week trading range of $1.07 to $11.91. Freddie Mac shares are up 21.1% to $7.99 on Friday versus a 52-week trading range of $1.04 to $8.90.\nRead Next:\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
