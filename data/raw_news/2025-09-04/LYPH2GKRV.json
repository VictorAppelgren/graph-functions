  "description": "A MUM has shared the heart-warming moment she finally got her \u201dforever home\u201d from the council. Single mum Chantelle, from the UK, claimed that she was \u201dhomeless\u201d for several\u2026",
  "content": "The woman lost her job to care full-time for her ''dying mum''\n\nHOUSE THIS? Mum shows off \u2018forever home\u2019 as she gets council house with baby but trolls say she\u2019s \u2018what\u2019s wrong with Britain today\u2019\n\nA MUM has shared the heart-warming moment she finally got her ''forever home'' from the council.\n\nSingle mum Chantelle, from the UK, claimed that she was ''homeless'' for several months and living in ''emergency'' and ''temporary accommodation'' prior to the news.\n\nLuckily, after ''nine months of hell'', Chantelle recently got the keys to her brand new ''forever home'' where she will be living with her ''baby'' daughter.\n\nChuffed with the new chapter, the mum took to TikTok to show off her new home, which included a plush kitchen, numerous spacious rooms and more.\n\nIn the video, Chantelle also revealed that the duo also have a gorgeous garden with a mini shed.\n\nThe property also boasts one toilet downstairs, as well a bathroom on the top floor.\n\n''Unfortunately me and my little girl became homeless due to a relationship breakdown and nothing I could do about it.\n\n''9 months in emergency and seen things we shouldn\u2019t have,'' Chantelle shared her story in the comments.\n\nAccording to Chantelle, prior to becoming ''homeless'', she was working and owned her own home.\n\nHowever, she sadly lost her job to care full-time for her ''dying mum'', who, unfortunately, passed away last year aged 66.\n\n''9 months of hell being homeless with my little girl, we finally have our forever home to make the most amazing memories!'' the mum wrote in the caption.\n\nHowever, despite the mother-daughter duo finally having their ''forever home'', not everyone was happy for them, as cruel trolls insisted that people like Chantelle are ''what's wrong with this country''.\n\nOne harsh viewer said: ''This is what\u2019s wrong with this country.\n\n''The expectation by so many that they deserve and hugely subsidised new build from the council, when others have to work their whole lives and can\u2019t even afford it.''\n\nThe person went on: ''I expect people to get what they work and pay for.\n\nHow can I get a council house? To apply for a council home, you need to fill out and hand in an application to your local authority. To find your local authority, simply use the Government's council locator tool on its website. Once you have access to your local council's website, it should offer you guidelines on how to complete your application. After applying, you'll most likely have to join a waiting list. Bear in mind, even if you are put on a waiting list, this doesn't guarantee you a council house offer. Your council should also offer you advice on how to stay in your current home and solve any issues you might have, such as problems with a private landlord or mortgage. You are eligible to apply for council housing if you are a British citizen living in the UK providing have not lived abroad recently. Each council has its own local rules about who qualifies to go on the housing register in its area, but it is based on \"points\" or a \"banding\" system. For example, you\u2019re likely to be offered housing first if you:\n\u2022 have a medical condition made worse by your current home Once you are high enough on a council's waiting list, it will contact you when a property is available. Some councils let people apply at the age of 18, while others let you apply even sooner at 16-year-olds. EU workers and their families and refugees may also be eligible. A council house is reached through a points system, so depending on your housing needs, you may be considered low priority. The council will contact you about any available property once you are high enough on the waiting list. There is no limit on how long you can expect to be on the waiting list.\n\n''Why should someone work their whole life and because of that not have a house anywhere this nice, when others either don\u2019t work or a lot less and get given it heavily subsidised?''\n\nAnother person chimed in: ''I worked and purchased a house. Thought that\u2019s what people are supposed to do.''\n\nLuckily for Chantelle, whose video has racked up close to 121k views in just one day, the vast majority of people congratulated the mum.\n\n''These are my favourite tiktoks. Love and happiness in your new home,'' wrote one person.\n\n''Never been this happy for a stranger,'' another told the TikToker who posts under the username @chantelle.singlemum.\n\n''Congratulations. Homelessness should never exist in the first place. Everyone deserves shelter,'' a third reminded.\n\nHitting back at the keyboard trolls, the single mum said ''they comment without having any facts to go off''.",
