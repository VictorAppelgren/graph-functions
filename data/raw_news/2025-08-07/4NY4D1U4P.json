  "description": "The National Football League's deal with Walt Disney in which it will gain an equity stake in ESPN in return for prime media assets is expected to face scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Justice, according to legal experts and industry sources.",
  "content": "LOS ANGELES, Aug 7 (Reuters) - The National Football League's deal with Walt Disney (DIS.N) in which it will gain an equity stake in ESPN in return for prime media assets is expected to face scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Justice, according to legal experts and industry sources.\n\nThe agreement, announced late Tuesday , involves Disney's ESPN acquiring the NFL Network and other media properties in exchange for the league receiving a 10 percent stake in the sports network.\n\nAndre P. Barlow, a partner at Doyle, Barlow & Mazard, said the transaction \"surely raises competition concerns,\" because it could potentially give Disney greater control over televised sports carriage and reduce competition.\n\n\"The deal could potentially result in higher costs for consumers, as Disney's dominance in sports media could limit options and drive up prices for streaming services or game access,\" Barlow said.\n\nThe Justice Department is expected to conduct a substantive review of the new ESPN-NFL transaction, according to one source familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. Another source said obtaining U.S. antitrust clearance could take up to 12 months.\n\nESPN and the NFL declined comment.\n\nThe expected review comes as the Justice Department's Antitrust Division is examining a separate deal Disney reached earlier this year to acquire a controlling stake in the sports streaming service Fubo TV. The division demanded further information from the companies in March to examine whether the deal would unduly concentrate the market for sports streaming.\n\nMeanwhile, the issue of rising costs for fans as games migrate to streaming services has reached the Senate, where the Commerce Committee held a hearing in May.\n\n\"In an era of deep partisan division, sports might be the most powerful cultural unifier we have,\" said Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who chairs the committee, noting it brings together Americans whether they're watching from their couches or in the stands. \"But those millions of fans are asking a simple question: 'Why does it seem to be getting harder -- and more expensive -- to just watch the game?'\"\n\nJohn Bergmayer, legal director of the non-profit Public Knowledge, voiced the same concerns.\n\n\"The proliferation of streaming services -- and the fragmentation of content between them -- means that the costs of watching streaming video are rising, and for many people can approach what they were paying on their cable bill,\" said Bergmayer in testimony to the committee. \"Some viewers feel like they finally broke free of the cable bundle only to watch it re-forming (before) their eyes.\"\n\nThe NFL has done outreach to 30 congressional offices to discuss the terms of its deal with ESPN and how it would result in greater consumer choice, according to one of the sources.\n\nUnder the agreement, ESPN would be able to add the NFL Network to its breadth of sports programming and incorporate it as part of its ESPN-branded streaming service. ESPN also plans to merge its fantasy football offering with that of the NFL.\n\nESPN also will be able to distribute the NFL's RedZone to cable and satellite TV distributors, along with its other channels. The NFL will retain streaming rights to NFL RedZone, which is available online through YouTube TV.\n\nDisney won swift approval for its $71 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets in 2018, during President Donald Trump's first term, though it was required to divest Fox's 22 regional sports networks to address competition concerns. At the time, Trump called to congratulate the Fox's Rupert Murdoch on the deal.\n\n\"It was worked out in record time,\" said Barlow, adding that this time around, he expects the Justice Department \"to take a close look before approving the deal.\"\n\nOne recent media deal, the $8.4 billion merger of Paramount Global (PARA.O) and Skydance Media, became bogged down in a lengthy regulatory review, as President Donald Trump sued Paramount, claiming the CBS News program \"60 Minutes\" deceptively edited an interview with his Democratic rival for the White House, former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission approved the transaction within days of Trump receiving a $16 million settlement , though FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said the civil suit and regulatory review were unrelated.\n\nPolitics could complicate the deal. Some sports industry insiders pointed to Trump's threats to interfere with a deal to build a new football stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the local NFL team, now known as the Commanders, changes its name back to Redskins, which was abandoned after decades of criticism that it was a racial slur.\n\nESPN is currently 80 percent owned by ABC Inc as an indirect subsidiary of Disney, with the other 20% owned by Hearst. If the deal is approved, ABC's stake would drop to 72 percent and Hearst would fall to 18 percent to grant the NFL a 10 percent stake.",

The Trust Principles imposed obligations on Reuters and its employees to act at all times with integrity, independence, and freedom from bias.\nReuters Directors and shareholders were determined to protect and preserve the Trust Principles when Reuters became a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A unique structure was put in place to achieve this. A new company was formed and given the name 'Reuters Founders Share Company Limited', its purpose being to hold a 'Founders Share' in Reuters.\nThe legal structure has evolved over time and the Founders Share and other contractual arrangements now confer a number of special rights upon the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company. For example, (i) the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company has enhanced voting rights in circumstances where someone is seeking to obtain a significant shareholding in, or acquire control of, Thomson Reuters and (ii) the prior consent of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company must be sought prior to undertaking any sale of, or other material transaction involving, the Reuters news business unit.\nThomson Reuters itself is obliged and committed to apply the Trust Principles to its operations.

The directors of Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company (known as \u2018Trustees\u2019) have a duty to ensure, to the extent possible, that the Trust Principles are complied with.\nThe Trustees are experienced and eminent people from diverse arenas in politics, diplomacy, media, public service and business. The Trustees are selected by a nomination committee and proposed to the board of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company for appointment. The nomination committee assists in scrutinizing candidates\u2019 suitability and its members include two persons appointed by the chairman after consultation with the European Court of Human Rights and representatives of certain press associations. The Thomson Reuters Corporation board has two representatives on the nomination committee. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company Board are members of the nomination committee, and the Chairman appoints three other directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company as members of the nomination committee. The Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company acts as chairman of the nomination committee.\nThe number of Trustees has to be at least 14 and not more than 18. Trustees have a minimum of two meetings per year, and receive reports on our activities in the different fields in which we operate (including Reuters news). The Trustees meet with both the Thomson Reuters Board and representatives of senior management.
