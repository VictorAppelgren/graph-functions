      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid skeleton but it falls short of a world‑class, multi‑year structural analysis because it lacks the quantitative anchors, first‑principles logic, and source‑level citations that the Section Focus demands. To upgrade it, first embed the real‑rate differential (e.g., Fed policy rate 5.25 % vs. euro‑zone 4.75 % [0G3A676BP]), the U.S. BoP surplus (≈ $1.2 trn in 2024 [0G3A676BP]) and the terms‑of‑trade improvement for cloud exports (≈ +3 % YoY [0G3A676BP]) as invariant anchors that drive the long‑run valuation premium for tech firms. Next, flesh out the causal chain: low real rates → cheaper capital → higher cloud‑AI spending → Microsoft’s 18 % YoY revenue growth and 39 % Azure growth [0G3A676BP] → premium multiples; Fed rate hikes of 25 bps would compress those multiples by ≈ 10 % [0G3A676BP]. Do the same for the automotive regime: quantify Tesla’s 17.9 % gross margin vs. Rivian’s projected 20 % margin post‑R2 launch, and link the loss of the $7,500 federal credit to a 5 % margin erosion for Tesla [P0K0UEOHU]. For insurance, cite Donegal’s dividend yield decline from 4.5 % in 2020 to 2.8 % in 2024 and its 3.2 % CAGR in operating margin [TN66GHPAT]. Structure the analysis into a clear scenario hierarchy: base case, upside (Fed rate cuts, R2 launch ahead of schedule), downside (Fed hike, Tesla’s robotaxi delay). Quantify each risk (e.g., a 50 bps Fed hike → 12 % tech PE compression; a 6 % margin drop for Tesla → 15 % share price decline). Add watch signals with dates (Fed minutes, EV credit policy changes, Tesla Q3 earnings, Rivian R2 production start). Finally, assign confidence levels (high for tech, moderate for automotive, low for insurance) and reconcile any conflicting data (e.g., Tesla’s 17.9 % margin vs. 16 % reported in Q2 by citing the specific quarter). Ensure every claim is tied to a source ID (e.g., 0G3A676BP, P0K0UEOHU, TN66GHPAT, 4LQD15CFU, JVKCZAPVG) and that the narrative flows from invariant anchors to market pricing, meeting the Section Focus requirements.",
