      "feedback": "This draft swings credibly on macro signals but falls short of a world‑class, multi‑year, first‑principles framework: the causal chain from policy to prices is underspecified, the regime structure and transition conditions are vague, and the base case lacks quantified anchors drawn from the sources; it also underutilizes critical numbers (Ford’s 17% YTD gain, Q2 4.3% adj. margin, 10.1% adj. ROIC, $1.3B EV loss, 2014–2024 CAGR ~2.5%) and understates how policy and financing conditions feed consumer/industrial demand; there is uneven coverage across sources (e.g., the Chips Act/Intel stake angle from H7Q52FKDH, Jackson Hole signaling from 37UZC9X8I and  H7Q52FKDH, personal-loan pricing math from C3ODMIQKZ, and consumer-frugality dynamics from 7 and 5) and insufficient reconciliation when narratives conflict (cyclical autos vs secular AI/tech upside). Actionable edits: (1) build an explicit, multi‑year regime framework with invariant anchors (state real rate differentials, terms of trade, productivity, BoP/external position, and a policy‑reaction function) and define regimes (e.g., inflation‑hot, disinflation with gradual easing, growth‑limited) plus clear transition conditions; ground these in first principles and tie to observable thresholds. (2) lay out a tight causal transmission: Fed signals at Jackson Hole (not a policy vote) shift rate expectations, reshaping discount rates and dollar dynamics, which in turn reprice equities and capex in autos and tech; attach IDs after each causal link (37UZC9X8I, H7Q52FKDH). (3) deliver a concrete base case plus upside/downside scenarios with quantified ranges anchored in sources (e.g., Ford: +17% YTD 2025; Q2 adj. margin 4.3%, ROIC 10.1%; EV losses; 2014–2024 revenue CAGR ~2.5% from 22PL3Q360) and use DGICB as a defensively biased data point with explicit dividend history/iconic health versus peers. (4) specify catalysts and invalidation tests: policy‑tone shifts at Jackson Hole, Chips Act funding/Intel stake developments, Ford’s EV profitability trajectory, and consumer financing conditions; define three triggers and a failsafe invalidation (e.g., inflation surprise pushes real rates meaningfully higher for two consecutive data prints). (5) quantify the transmission through consumer finance: integrate numeric implications from personal‑loan pricing (APR bands 6–36%, average ~11.6% for 24‑month bank loans; payoff and term math) to illustrate how financing costs constrain durable‑goods demand (C3ODMIQKZ). (6) tighten and unify referencing by placing each assertion with a source ID and avoid non‑central items (e.g., extraneous retailer anecdotes) unless they illuminate the regime/financing link; (7) reconcile conflicts by presenting a synthesized view: cyclical autos remain a lever, but policy‑backed AI/semis exposure and Chips Act financing can cap downside in tech supply chains, requiring explicit sensitivities to rate paths; (8) restructure toward a clean horizon/section focus: provide a crisp base case, then a regime map, then catalysts/invalidation, then what to watch and confidence, with succinct, data‑driven language; (9) reduce narrative fluff and replace adjectives with numbers from the sources, and (10) ensure the final paragraph stays within length constraints while preserving the depth of the causal chain and the explicit, sourced numbers.",
