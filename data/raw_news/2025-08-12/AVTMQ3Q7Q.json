  "title": "Why a $599 MacBook may be the most enticing laptop for Windows 10 users later this year",
  "description": "Rumors point to a new budget-friendly MacBook using the iPhone's A18 Pro chipset, launching as early as fall 2025.",
  "content": "\u2022 Apple could be developing a new budget-friendly MacBook for around $599.\n\u2022 Rumors state it would house an A18 Pro chipset -- the processor found in the iPhone 16 Pro.\n\u2022 Despite corroboration by industry experts, information is speculative.\n\nAbout a month ago, rumors starting surfacing that Apple was developing a lightweight MacBook that runs on iPhone hardware. Notable Apple insider Ming-Chi Kuo supported the rumors in a post on X in July, claiming the company was currently working on a \"more-affordable MacBook\" running on the A18 Pro chipset -- the same one found in the iPhone 16 Pro -- instead of an M-series processor.\n\nAlso: 5 Apple products you definitely shouldn't buy this month (and 7 to get instead)\n\nTech news site DigiTimes claims to have recently spoken to an insider with intimate knowledge of this laptop, suggesting the device will cost somewhere between $599 and $699: much cheaper than the M4 MacBook Air's starting price of $999.\n\nEven more notable is the alleged timing of such a product: releasing this fall, just as millions of PC users are looking for a new computer when Microsoft pulls the plug on support for Windows 10.\n\nDigiTimes reports this new MacBook will sport a 12.9-inch display, slightly smaller than the MacBook Air's 13-inch screen. What's interesting is that this size closely correlates with what Kuo said a month ago.\n\nIn fact, much of the information told to DigiTimes lines up with Kuo wrote. According to the report, components may enter \"mass production\" by the end of Q3 2025 (sometime in September). Then, the laptop will become \"commercially available\" by either late 2025 or early 2026, which, as MacRumors points out, is \"similar to [Ming Chi Kuo's] launch estimation.\"\n\nAlso: Apple's improved Siri voice assistant may finally have a release date - and I'm ready to ditch Gemini for it\n\nDetails, however, remain scarce. There's much we don't know, but it is worth mentioning that the future MacBook is rumored to launch in a variety of colors, including Pink, Blue, Silver, and Yellow, breaking the mold of what MacBooks look like.\n\nWindows 10 support officially ends on October 14, 2025 as Microsoft aims to push users to Windows 11. If this laptop hits the market in November or December, not only would it be in the middle of the holiday season, but may also prove totally irresistible to Windows 10 users looking for a new device without all the bloat or unnecessary features. That said, it probably won't be a perfect device.\n\nMacRumors mentions the fact \"that the A19 pro chip lacks Thunderbolt support\", meaning the future MacBook could only have regular USB-C ports. Thunderbolt ports have unique features like the ability to send out video signals to multiple monitors simulateanously and lightning-fast data trasnfer speeds.\n\nThat could be a dealbreaker for some, but the advent of a low-cost MacBook cheaper than the Air may be too alluring to ignore.\n\nThe laptop isn't the only rumored project. Kuo also claimed that Apple is working on a pair of smart glasses set to release in 2027. This pair will reportedly function similarly to Meta Ray-Bans, as it won't have a heads up display. However, he suggested the glasses will provide audio playback, record video, and support \"AI environmental sensing\", with multiple material and style options.\n\nLooking for the next best product?

Microsoft has stated, forcefully, that it will not revise those requirements. You will also hit roadblocks if your PC doesn't have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0, or if the TPM is not enabled.\nAlso: Two ways to get free Windows 10 security updates through October 2026\nThat might be the official policy, but -- as with everything Windows-related -- it pays to read the fine print.\nThose pesky restrictions prevent you from automatically upgrading to Windows 11 using Windows Update or the Windows 11 Installation Assistant. Yet, as I detail in ZDNET's Windows 11 FAQ, there are documented workarounds for most PCs that were originally built for Windows 10.\nOver the past few years, Microsoft has played a cat-and-mouse game with enthusiasts, adding occasional speed bumps that make it more difficult to bypass these compatibility checks. There are workarounds for most modern PCs, but some older devices, especially those built using AMD processors, might be out of luck. The instructions below take all those developments into account.\nAlso: Can your old PC handle the Windows 11 upgrade? How to find out - before you try\nThese instructions also assume that you have a PC running a retail or OEM edition of Windows 10 (Home or Pro) and that you are signed in as an administrator on the PC you want to upgrade.\nWhich option should you choose?\nPlease don't skip over this section.\nThis article describes two upgrade options. To take advantage of the workaround described in option 1 below, your computer must meet all the other requirements for Windows 11.\n- It must be configured to start up using UEFI, not a legacy BIOS configuration.\n- Secure Boot must be supported, although it does not need to be enabled. (But seriously, folks, you should enable Secure Boot.)\n- A TPM must be enabled; version 1.2 is OK, but a system without any TPM or with the TPM disabled will fail. Any PC that was originally designed for Windows 10 should include a TPM 2.0.\nTo check these details on a PC you're considering upgrading, run the System Information utility, Msinfo32.exe, and look at the System Summary page. Pay special attention to the BIOS Mode value. If it says \"Legacy,\" you'll need to reconfigure your system to UEFI mode (and convert your system disk from MBR to GPT partitioning) before you can install Windows 11 as a normal upgrade.\nAlso: Why Windows 11 requires a TPM - and how to get around it\nTo see whether your PC has a TPM enabled, run the Trusted Platform Module Management tool, Tpm.msc. If your computer includes a TPM and it's turned on, this app will display information about it. Under the TPM Manufacturer Information heading, check the specification version to confirm that it is 2.0. If there's no TPM, or if the TPM is disabled in firmware settings, you'll see a message that says \"Compatible TPM cannot be found.\"\nIf you're unable (or unwilling) to change from Legacy BIOS to UEFI, or if you have an older PC that doesn't have a TPM option at all, you'll need to use the second option, which takes advantage of an undocumented hack that allows you to bypass the compatibility checks and complete the upgrade. Skip to the Option 2 section of this post for details on how to use the free Rufus utility to perform this upgrade.\nAlso: How to install Windows 11 your way (and avoid Microsoft's restrictions)\nFinally, note that Microsoft added a new set of restrictions as part of the Windows 11 version 24H2 update. These changes require a CPU that supports specific instructions -- SSE4.2 and PopCnt. Most PCs with Intel CPUs from 2009 or later will meet this standard. AMD CPUs from 2013 or later should also meet these requirements. But it is impossible to upgrade to Windows 11 version 24H2 on a PC that was built in 2008 or earlier. For details, see \"Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This trusty tool can (probably) fix that.\"\nIf you plan to perform a clean installation of Windows 11, you can boot from installation media and run Windows Setup. That option skips the CPU compatibility check completely (but still requires a TPM and Secure Boot support). After the installation completes, you'll need to reinstall all your apps, restore your data files, and tweak settings to personalize your system preferences.\nWant to avoid all that hassle? Choose the option that's appropriate for your hardware.\nOption 1: Use this simple registry edit\nWith this registry edit, you can bypass CPU checks and accept any TPM version. Please be aware that this option requires that you run the Setup program from within your current Windows installation. You can't boot from a USB flash drive and install Windows 11 this way.\nThis process requires four steps.\n1. Change one key in the Windows registry\nYou need to make one small change to the Windows registry. For more than three years, this change was documented at Microsoft's support website, but the company removed those instructions in December 2024. (Here's an archived version of that support article.) This change tells the Windows 11 Setup program to skip the check for compatible CPUs and to allow installation on a PC with an older TPM (version 1.2). The usual warnings apply when working with the registry; I recommend you make a complete backup before proceeding.\nOpen Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) and navigate to the following key:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\MoSetup\nIf the MoSetup key doesn't exist, you need to create it. Right-click the node for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup in the left-hand navigation pane, then choose New > Key. Name it MoSetup and press Enter.\nAlso: Wiping your Windows laptop? Here's the simplest way to erase all personal data\nSelect the MoSetup key and then right-click in any empty space in the pane on the right. Choose the option to create a new DWORD value. (Don't choose the QWORD option!)\nReplace the default name for that key by typing the text AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU and then press Enter. Then double-click the new value and change the \"Value data\" box to 1. The result should look like this:\nCheck for typos before proceeding -- Windows is frustratingly literal about the contents of the registry, and if you misspell the key or value name, your upgrade will fail. Click OK to save your change, and then restart your PC.\n2. Download the Windows 11 ISO\nOn the PC you want to upgrade, go to the Windows 11 Download page (aka.ms/DownloadWindows11) and choose the option at the bottom of the page, \"Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices.\" Save the ISO file in your Downloads folder.\nNote that this is a big file. Depending on the speed of your internet connection, the download could take a while.\nAlso: The ultimate Windows 11 upgrade guide: Everything you need to know\nFor those running Windows with English (UK) as the selected language, choose English (United States) when prompted for a product language. Several readers have reported that choosing English International results in an upgrade that does not allow you to keep installed apps and data files.\n3. Mount the ISO file in File Explorer\nAfter the download completes, open File Explorer and double-click the ISO file you downloaded in the previous step. Doing so mounts the file as a virtual DVD drive in its own folder, with its own drive letter.\n4. Run Windows Setup\nIn File Explorer, find the Setup.exe file in the virtual drive you opened in the previous step and double-click it to begin the upgrade. You'll see a stern warning about compatibility issues and the possibility that performing an upgrade will mean you are not entitled to future updates. You can safely click Accept to move past this message. (For details on what that warning message really means, see \"Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?\" Spoiler: They are not going to cut off security updates.) After you click OK on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues.\nIf you're upgrading from the same edition (Home or Pro), you'll have three options: You can keep your apps, settings, and files (Full Upgrade); keep your data files but start fresh with apps and settings (Keep Data Only); or start completely fresh (Clean Install).\nOption 2: Use the free Rufus utility\nOn older PCs without a TPM and on PCs that don't support Secure Boot, you'll need to use an undocumented hack to bypass the compatibility checker. You can do this manually by replacing the Appraiserres.dll file (in the Sources subfolder on the Windows 11 installer drive) with a zero-byte version and then making a series of registry edits. But it's simpler to use the free, open-source Rufus utility to create installation media (on a USB flash) drive that includes these tweaks automatically.\nTo get started, download Rufus version 4.6 or later. Earlier versions won't work, thanks to changes Microsoft made in October 2024 to its compatibility checking tools. For details of how the newer versions work, see \"Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This just-released tool can get the job done.\" In addition, be aware that using Rufus will not allow you to bypass the new restrictions on very old PCs that were introduced with Windows 11 version 24H2.\nIf you have a PC with a CPU that lacks support for SSE4.2 and PopCnt instructions, not even Rufus can help. (Of course, any PC that fails that test is nearly 20 years old and probably deserves to be retired.)\nAlso: Yes, you can upgrade that old PC to Windows 11, even if Microsoft says no. These readers proved it\nTo get started, you'll need to download the Windows 11 ISO. Be sure to save it to the Downloads folder of your Windows system drive so you can find it easily. You'll also need a USB flash drive of at least 16 GB in size. You will reformat this drive as part of the process, so back up any data on that drive first -- and do not store the Windows 11 ISO here!\n- Download Rufus from the developer's site or from the Microsoft Store and run the app.\n- Choose the USB drive and then choose the \"Disk or ISO image\" option.\n- Click the Select button, choose the Windows 11 ISO you downloaded earlier, and then click Start.\n- In the Windows User Experience dialog, select the first checkbox to remove hardware requirements, as shown in the screenshot below.\n- Click OK to begin creating the drive.\nAfter Rufus successfully creates your installer, open that USB drive in File Explorer, and double-click Setup. Do not try to upgrade by booting from that USB drive and performing a clean install; it won't work.\nAs is the case with the other option, you'll see a warning about compatibility issues. It's a scare tactic. (For details on what the language in that warning message actually means, see \"Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?\") After you click Accept on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues.\nAlso: Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This trusty tool can (probably) fix that\nMy ZDNET colleague Lance Whitney has more details on the other options available with Rufus in \"How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and bypass Microsoft's restrictions).\"\nDid your upgrade work?\nIf you've tried this upgrade, I want to hear about your experience. If it worked, please share the details. If you run into snags, send me an email so we can figure out what's going wrong.

Luckily, we've gone hands-on with all of Apple's latest MacBooks, from the light and portable MacBook Air to the powerhouse MacBook Pro. Taking into account memory, portability, features and value, we broke down the pros, cons, and ideal use cases across Apple's laptops.\nInformed by a combination of benchmarking programs, performance testing, and everyday use, we tested Apple's latest MacBooks to measure battery life, visual quality, performance, and practical use in everyday settings.\nWhat's the best MacBook right now?\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air M4 is the best all-around laptop for the majority of users. The 15-inch display is just the right size, it's lightweight enough to commute with, and the upgraded M4 Air processor is fast and battery-efficient. The best part? The M4 MacBook Air comes with more memory for less, with a 10-core CPU on the low end and a 32GB configuration on the high end. This amount of memory was previously unavailable on a MacBook Air, but now, the laptop that set the standard for ultraportables is more powerful than ever.\nAlso: The best laptops you can buy\nBefore Apple announced the MacBook Air M4 in early 2025, rumors abounded on what new features it would come with. As the last of Apple's core line of devices to get the latest M4 chip, the MacBook Air is an incremental upgrade to the M3, more of a refinement and improvement than an earth-shattering new release.\nAnd that's a good thing. The 15-inch MacBook Air M4 is our pick for the best all-around MacBook for the majority of users for its versatility, lightweight form factor, and powerful suite of features. The 15-inch display is just the right size to be portable yet still feel premium and spacious, and now supports two external monitors while the lid is open.\nReview: Apple MacBook Air M4 (15-inch) review\nDuring my testing of the M4, I got over 14 hours of battery life with the device running a 4K video at half brightness, which is about where I expected it to be and about the same as last year's MacBook Air M3. That translates to a full day at the office, even with video calls. And speaking of, they look great with the crisp and clear 12MP Center Stage webcam with 1080p HD video recording.\nBasically, if you are unsure what kind of MacBook to get, we recommend this one. Unless you need to push the limits of performance with a premium processor, the MacBook Air M4 is a capable MacBook for everyone, especially since the upgraded unified memory makes it look a little more like a MacBook Pro.\nMacBook Air M4 (15-inch) specs: Display size: 15.3-inch | Display type: Liquid Retina XDR | Resolution: 2880 x 1864 pixels | Unified Memory: 16GB-32GB | Storage: Up to 2TB | CPU: 10-core M4 | Battery life: Up to 18 hours\nThe MacBook Pro M4 meets the needs of most users, but is particularly well-suited for creatives looking for a powerful laptop for photo and video editing. Yes, technically, the higher-tier M4 Pro and M4 Max chipsets have even more power under the hood for demanding workflows, but we want to call out the base-level MacBook Pro M4 because of how well balanced and capable it is for the vast majority of creative projects relative to price.\nWhether for photo editing, video work, or light gaming, the M4 handled everything smoothly in our testing, even outperforming the old M1 Pro chip. Additionally, starting with 16GB of unified memory and going up to 24GB, the MacBook Pro M4 still has the power behind it to push that performance to the next level.\nReview: MacBook Pro (M4)\nBesides the raw power, however, a handful of quality-of-life features go a long way toward its practicality. The M4 MacBook Pro has three USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports, with one on the right side of the laptop. Also, the new processor allows the computer to extend up to two monitors while the lid is open. Previously, you'd have to close the MacBook lid to power two external monitors.\nLastly, the display looks great as ever, with the new brightness rating -- 1,000 nits at SDR and 1,600 nits at HDR -- paired with the optional, expensive (but so satisfying) nano-texture coating makes this one of the best-looking laptop displays I've used. The matte-frosted layering significantly reduces glare, while the brighter panel just manages to beat out bright light sources.\nMacBook Pro M4 specs: Display size: 14-inch | Display type: Liquid Retina XDR with nano-texture glass | Resolution: 3024 x 1964 pixels | Unified Memory: 16GB-24GB | Storage: Up to 1TB | CPU: 10-core M4 | Battery life: Up to 24 hours\nIf you're looking for a MacBook designed with professional creators in mind and can handle top-tier gaming, the MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip brings a whole new level of performance to the series.\nWe're talking a 14-core CPU and 20-core GPU with up to 48GB of unified memory and a brilliant 16-inch Liquid Retina XDR display. When it comes to on-device AI, the M4 Pro features a 16-core neural engine for powering fast and efficient local AI tasks, which are plenty in the latest macOS.\nAlso: I swapped my Windows laptop for a MacBook Air M4, and finally understand the hype\nConnectivity is also a huge step up from the base MacBook Pro with three Thunderbolt 5 ports, an HDMI port, SDXC card slot, headphone jack, and MagSafe 3 port -- all quality of life features that creatives working across multiple mediums will appreciate.\nBut it's not just all about processor performance. Video and audio are studio-quality with the M4 Pro, with ProMotion technology for adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz and a high-fidelity six-speaker sound system with woofers to elevate the gaming and entertainment experience.\nMacBook Pro with M4 Pro (16-inch) specs: Display size: 16-inch | Display type: Liquid Retina XDR Display | Resolution: 3456 x 2234 pixels (Full HD+) | Unified Memory: 24-48GB | Storage: Up to 4TB | CPU: 14-core M4 Pro | GPU: 20-core M4 Pro | Battery life: Up to 18 hours\nWith every new year of MacBook upgrades, it's easy to write off previous versions as obsolete. But the truth is that models from two, three, or more years ago are still highly competitive machines in 2025. Case in point: the MacBook Air M2 from 2022 is a powerful laptop in its own right, but quite a bit more affordable now that the M4 is on shelves.\nIf you're looking for a new MacBook but want to save some money, this is a great option. The configuration with 8GB of unified memory and 256GB of storage starts at $749 at Best Buy right now, which is half the cost of a new MacBook Air M4 while retaining many of the same features.\nReview: MacBook Air M2\nFor example, the 13-inch MacBook Air M2 is just as ultraportable and lightweight, with fantastic battery life and access to the latest Apple Intelligence features in macOS. Even though it doesn't have the Center Stage camera that automatically centers you in the screen, the webcam in the M2 still looks great. It's a 1080p FaceTime HD camera with a three-mic array and a four-speaker sound system with Spatial Audio for an enjoyable video calling experience.\nMacBook Air M2 (13-inch) specs: Display size: 13.6-inch | Display type: Retina Display | Resolution: 2560 x 1664 pixels | Unified Memory: 8GB | Storage: 256GB | CPU: 8-core M2 | Battery life: Up to 17 hours\nWhen it first came out in 2024, we called the MacBook Air M3 Apple's AI computer for the masses, noting it as the successful culmination of Apple's thin and light lineup, while still being pro enough for most users. Today, all of that remains true, even with the MacBook Air M4 in the game.\nThe 13-inch M3 is differentiated from the newer version by a few key features, namely the M4's ability to support two external monitors with the lid open, a 10-core CPU (as opposed to the 8-core on the M3), the option for more memory, and a slightly better webcam, but that's where most of the similarities end.\nReview: MacBook Air M3 (13-inch)\nThe M3 is comparable in power, performance, and battery life, with a price that often dips well below the $1,000 mark, especially when on sale. For a work laptop, the M3 MacBook Air is well-positioned to handle daily tasks with an all-day battery, 16-core neural engine, and best of all: the thin and light form factor that set the bar for ultraportables.\nIf the horsepower behind a $2,000+ MacBook Pro is overkill, we suggest springing for the M3 MacBook Air as a work laptop that's more than capable, especially for hybrid commuters who don't want to tote around a bulky device.\nMacBook Air M3 (13-inch) specs: Display size: 13.6-inch | Display type: Liquid Retina Display | Resolution: 2560 x 1664 pixels | Unified Memory: 8-24GB | Storage: 256GB | CPU: 8-core M3 | Battery life: Up to 18 hours\nWhat are the tariffs in the US?\nThe recent US tariffs on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and India aim to boost domestic manufacturing but are likely to drive up prices on consumer electronics. Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production.\nAlso: Tariff war has tech buyers wondering what's next. Here's what we know\nLaptops and PCs are also hit hard by the new U.S. tariffs, with import duties potentially increasing prices by up to 35%. Many major brands still rely on Chinese and Vietnamese factories for assembly, meaning consumers could soon pay significantly more for everything from budget Chromebooks to high-end gaming rigs.\nThese tariffs may accelerate efforts to move production to regions like Mexico or India, but shoppers can expect higher costs and fewer discounts in the short term.\nRight now, it looks like some tech may be exempt from the issued tariffs, but since it's always changing and developing, we are keeping an eye on it and will update you on the latest.\nAlso: Tariff exemptions for electronics offer a break for tech - but not for long\nWhat is the best MacBook?\nZDNET's top pick for the best MacBook is the 15-inch Air M4, sporting the latest in Apple Silicon chip technology, a gorgeous display, great battery life, and more memory for a lower starting price. We think it's the best MacBook for most users, but there are both more powerful and more budget-friendly MacBooks out there.\nThis chart breaks down how the MacBooks stack up with the top features, from price to CPU/GPU, screen size, and display resolution.\nBest MacBook | Starting price | CPU/GPU | Memory/Storage |\nMacBook Air M4 (15-inch) | $1,169 | 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU | Up to 32GB, up to 2TB |\nMacBook Pro M4 (14-inch) | $1,449 | 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU | Up to 32GB, up to 2TB |\nMacBook Pro M4 Pro (16-inch) | $2,499 | 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU | Up to 48GB, up to 4TB |\nMacBook Air M2 (13-inch) | $889 | 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU | Up to 24GB, up to 1TB |\nMacBook Air M3 (13-inch) | $1,099 | 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU | Up to 24GB, up to 2TB |\nWhich is the right MacBook for you?\nWe get it, once you start looking at all the different MacBooks side by side, it can get a little confusing. If you're looking for an all-around solid MacBook that can do a bit of everything, we think the MacBook Air M4 (15-inch) is your best bet, but there are other options that might be better for you personally.\nHere's a well-researched (and tested) list of our favorite MacBooks for the most common use cases.\nChoose this MacBook\u2026 | If you want\u2026 |\nMacBook Air M4 (15-inch) | The newest MacBook Air that's powerful enough for work and play, with a middle-ground 15-inch size. |\nMacBook Pro M4 (14-inch) | A more powerful MacBook with the latest M4 processor with more memory, but don't want to spend $2,500 or more on the top-tier configuration. |\nMacBook Pro M4 Pro (16-inch) | One of the most powerful MacBooks you can buy, with powerful hardware and a large Liquid Retina XDR display that supports ray tracing. |\nMacBook Air M2 (13-inch) | A thin and light 13-inch MacBook without breaking the bank. |\nMacBook Air M3 (13-inch) | A powerful but ultraportable laptop for work. |\nHow we test laptops\nWe use a combination of methods to test laptops here at ZDNET. First, we acquire data from benchmarking software to analyze a system's metrics under the hood and compare those to advertised numbers. Then, we spend an extended amount of time with the laptop -- usually a week or two -- using it the same way a normal consumer would, to assess its portability, form factor, and how well the battery actually holds up. For an extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive laptop testing methodology.\n- Benchmarking: First, we run a series of tests to put the computer's hardware through the wringer in order to see what it's capable of. Cinebench is one of the most commonly used hardware testing suites, which tests the laptop's rendering performance on single and multiple central processing unit (CPU) cores. PCMark 10 is another powerful program that covers a wide variety of tasks performed in the workplace, and there are many others that we use in tandem to gather as much data as we can. Some components we run tests on include:\n- Processor: The \"brain\" of the laptop and one of the most important factors that determines performance. The four biggest manufacturers that make most of the CPUs found in laptops today are Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple -- in Apple machines only. This is tested in benchmarking software.\n- The display: The size of the display -- measured diagonally from corner to corner -- is also what dictates the laptop's overall size and plays a big role in the device's cost. Brightness is measured in \"nits,\" and color spectrums are tested in benchmarking software.\n- The graphics processor (GPU): Whether it's integrated into the CPU or a dedicated graphics card, how well the machine handles graphics is a key factor when it comes to demanding tasks like video editing, rendering, and of course, gaming. We test the GPU with a combination of benchmarking software, gaming, and media playback.\n- Physical form factor: Finally, the laptop's overall appearance and physical form factor encompasses its weight, thickness, how the keyboard and trackpad feel, and whether it has a display that can be folded back to form a tablet. We carry the laptop around for at least a week and note how well it commutes.\n- Battery testing: We test a unit's battery in a few ways. A handful of benchmarking programs have their own battery testing components, but we will also just let the laptop run for as long as it can under a medium load. We ensure screensavers and hibernation mode are turned off, set the display's brightness and audio at 50%, load up a livestream on YouTube in Chrome, and wait 'til the end.\n- The human element: As we mentioned earlier, metrics and system data are important, but numbers alone don't give you the full picture. This is where we weave in our personal experience with the device and tap into the practical use cases that consumers actually care about.\nUltimately, our goal is to break down the capabilities of each and every laptop we test into digestible terms that real people find useful. There is a lot of noise and confusion when it comes to navigating the laptop and computer consumer market, so we hope to bring an intuitive element to the whole process by leveraging our team's decades of experience.\nWhat are some factors to consider when choosing the best MacBooks?\nEven though MacBooks might look pretty similar on the surface, there are some big differences between them. The best one for you depends on what you plan on using it for. Do you want something thin and light for traveling to work, or do you need substantial RAM and storage for demanding workloads? Here are some key considerations.\n- Portability: The MacBook Air lineup features the thinnest and lightest MacBooks. Obviously, the 13-inch MacBook Air is thinner and lighter than the 15-inch Air, but the small size might be too much of a trade-off. If you end up plugging the laptop into an external monitor anyway, the small-sized 13-inch laptop might make little difference.\n- Performance: Apple's Silicon processors start at the base level M2, M3, or M4, then move up to the Pro, then at the top of the performance chart are the Max chips. Each subsequent generation is slightly more powerful than the previous, but the differences between the M3 and M4, for example, are not earth-shattering.\n- Storage and RAM: The more unified memory your MacBook has, the better equipped it is at performing complex tasks. The MacBook Air M4 is now offered with 32GB of memory, an upgrade from previous versions, which capped out at 24GB. MacBook Pro devices scale to much higher memory options, but you will quickly see the price inflate.\n- Purpose: We broke down the five best MacBooks for the most common use-cases, and are confident one of them would be right for you. If you're unsure about which one applies, the 15-inch MacBook Air M4 is the best all-around MacBook that the majority of users will love.\n- Value: The best laptop can be a pricey investment, so we considered qualities that assure you'll get your money's worth. The older MacBooks, particularly M2 and earlier, are often heavily discounted, despite still being competitive machines in 2025.\nFAQs on laptops\nWhy should you buy a laptop, and not a desktop or a tablet?\nWhile Apple's iMac, Mac Mini, and Mac Studio desktops have their fair share of fans, MacBooks outsell all of those devices combined thanks to the broad selection of sizes, use cases, and just how enjoyable they are to use.\nWith the latest M4 MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, you can still connect to two external monitors with the laptop's display open, promoting a desktop-style user experience, anyway (earlier versions just require you to close the lid for two displays).\nWhat are the best MacBooks for gaming?\nWhile you can run less demanding games on a MacBook Air, we recommend opting for a MacBook Pro if you're into more serious titles. The additional processing power combined with more GPU cores, support for ray tracing, and better cooling mean you're going to have a much better experience. The M4 MacBook Pro is a surprisingly good gaming laptop in 2025, even though Apple computers have notoriously been second-choice machines for gamers.\nWhat are the best MacBooks for students?\nIt really depends on the student, but there are some common factors to consider when shopping for a laptop for school. You'll want something small and lightweight for easier commutes to and from school and between classes.\nAlso: The best laptops for college: Expert tested\nYou'll also want something with at least eight hours of battery life to get through a typical school day without needing to plug in. This is excellent for younger kids who may be forgetful and leave their charging cable at home. The MacBook Air M3 is one of the best all-around laptops for school, but the 13-inch MacBook Air M2 is a smart option as well for a very approachable price.\nWhat are the best MacBooks for business?\nWhether you're looking for a single laptop for yourself or a fleet for your business, the best MacBooks for work offer great performance, multiple connectivity options, and durable builds.\nYou'll probably want a MacBook with at least 16GB of RAM, a 512GB storage drive, and a display large enough to work on without being too bulky to travel with. You'll also want a model with at least eight hours of battery life to get through a typical day of work without needing to recharge constantly.\nThe MacBook Pro M4 is a fantastic device for work, but if you want something light and portable, we recommend the 13-inch MacBook Air M3, which is light and easy to carry, but performs well when connected to external monitors.\nWhat are the best MacBooks for video editing?\nWe strongly recommend getting an M4 MacBook and purchasing Final Cut Pro, an editing software exclusive to the Mac ecosystem. Buying the MacBook M3 Max is another good option if you want some serious raw power. It sports an M3 Max chip and offers great performance for content creators, while seeing a bit of a reduced price since the release of the M4. The machine can also handle 4TB of footage with ease, and sports additional I/O."

      "text": "Apple's improved Siri voice assistant may finally have a release date - and I'm ready to ditch Gemini for it\nZDNET's key takeaways:\n- An upgraded version of App Intents could make Siri the true hands-free iPhone companion.\n- Apple is currently testing these Siri App Intents with a handful of third-party apps.\n- The revamped Siri could ship in the spring of 2026, reports Bloomberg.\nWhen Apple first announced an upgraded and more capable Siri, every one of its users was reasonably excited. Unfortunately, that promise never happened, and the new Siri continues to be delayed. However, ahead of the upcoming Apple event, new details have emerged that may make antsy users a little more patient.\nAnd if the rumors are true, I'm anticipating the big Siri rollout to finally get me to switch from Gemini to Apple's voice assistant.\nAlso: This iOS 26 update ruined the iPhone camera app for me - then Apple saved the day\nAccording to a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, App Intents could \"finally make Siri the true hands-free controller of your iPhone.\" He explains, \"App Intents will mean: With nothing but your voice, you'll be able to tell Siri to find a specific photo, edit it, and send it off. Or comment on an Instagram post\u2026. Siri could operate your apps like you would -- with precision, inside their own interfaces.\"\nWhy this upgrade matters so much\nAll of this still sounds like a far-fetched dream, especially when other companies are struggling to publicly roll out similar capabilities to their voice assistants. Amazon announced Alexa+ in February and showcased demos of it booking an Uber and a concert ticket, but Alexa+ is yet to get wider public availability.\nIt's because it is hard to get high-stakes tasks related to health or banking apps correct every time. Gurman reports that Apple engineers have been struggling to ensure that revamped Siri is \"accurate enough to handle high-stakes scenarios.\"\nAlso: 5 iOS 26 features that made updating my iPhone worthwhile (and how to try them)\nPer the report, Apple is currently testing these Siri App Intents with a handful of third-party apps, like YouTube, Amazon, Facebook, WhatsApp, Temu, Threads, and more. However, it could \"sharply limit what Siri can do\" in other sensitive categories and even exclude those areas altogether.\nA new and updated voice assistant isn't just about making Siri smarter but enabling a new, voice-first interface across the Apple ecosystem. As of now, Gemini Live has been the most capable voice assistant on a phone, from those that I have tested.\nI'm currently using the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and find myself conversing with Gemini Live frequently, but there's friction when it comes to app compatibility. I wish I could add ideas to my working Google Doc or reschedule meetings and Calendar invites just by asking my phone, but that's not possible yet.\nGoogle is expanding Gemini Live support to several in-house productivity apps, which should improve the experience -- I can now add my thoughts to Google Keep and add reminders to Google Calendar, which is far more capable than the current version of Siri.\nAlso: I changed these 6 settings on my iPad to significantly improve its battery life\nBut if Apple succeeds in building the Siri that's being speculated about, I would gladly switch to using it instead of Google's Gemini.\nI love it when I am out and about and my Meta Ray-Bans announce a WhatsApp notification, and let me reply to that person or call them without touching my phone. I see a future where I won't have to touch a screen to interact with my gadget, but will be able to talk to it through my smartglasses or a pair of earbuds.\nWhile this idea sounds fun and futuristic, it'll have higher risks and little margin of error, which is why it hasn't happened yet. As Gurman says, if Apple is actually able to bring it to market, \"it could potentially be a hit that many users didn't see coming.\"\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-gpt-5s-coding-skills-and-it-was-so-bad-that-im-sticking-with-gpt-4o-for-now/",
      "text": "I tested GPT-5's coding skills, and it was so bad that I'm sticking with GPT-4o (for now)\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- OpenAI's new GPT-5 flagship failed half of my programming tests.\n- Previous OpenAI releases have had just about perfect results.\n- Now that OpenAI has enabled fallbacks to other LLMs, there are options.\nSo GPT-5 happened. It's out. It's released. It's the talk of the virtual town. And it's got some problems. I'm not gonna bury the lede. GPT-5 has failed half of my programming tests. That's the worst that OpenAI's flagship LLM has ever done on my carefully designed tests.\nAlso: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)\nBefore I get into the details, let's take a moment to discuss one other little feature that's also a bit wonky. Check out the new Edit button on the top of the code dumps it generates.\nClicking the Edit button takes you into a nice little code editor. Here, I replaced the Author field, right in ChatGPT's results.\nThat seemed nice, but it ultimately proved futile. When I closed the editor, it asked me if I wanted to save. I did. Then this unhelpful message showed up.\nI never did get back to my original session. I had to submit my original prompt again, and let GPT-5 do its work a second time.\nBut wait. There's more. Let's dig into my test results\u2026\n1. Writing a WordPress plugin\nThis was my very first test of coding prowess for any AI. It's what gave me that first \"the world is about to change\" feeling, and it was done using GPT-3.5.\nSubsequent tests, using the same prompt but with different AI models, generated mixed results. Some AIs did great, some didn't. Some AIs, like those from Microsoft and Google, improved over time.\nAlso: How I test an AI chatbot's coding ability - and you can, too\nChatGPT's model has been the gold standard for this test since the very beginning. That makes the results of GPT-5 all that much more curious.\nSo, look, the actual coding with GPT-5 was partially successful. GPT-5 generated a single block of code, which I pasted into a file and was able to run. It provided the requisite UI.\nWhen I pasted in the test names, it dynamically updated the line count, although it described it as \"Line to randomize\" instead of \"Lines to randomize.\"\nBut then, when I clicked Randomize, it didn't. Instead, it redirected me to tools.php. What?? ChatGPT has never had a problem with this test, whether GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or GPT-4o. You mean to tell me that OpenAI's much-anticipated GPT-5 is failing right out of the gate? Ouch.\nAlso: How to use GPT-5 in VS Code with GitHub Copilot\nI then gave GPT-5 this prompt.\nWhen I click randomize, I'm taken to http://testsite.local/wp-admin/tools.php. I do not get a list of randomized results. Can you fix?\nThe result was a line to patch. I'm not thrilled with that approach because it requires the user to dig through code and to make no mistakes replacing a line.\nSo, I asked GPT-5 for a full plugin. It gave me the full text of the plugin to copy and paste. This time, it worked.\nThis time, it did randomize the lines. When it encountered duplicates, it separated them from each other, as it was instructed. Finally.\nAlso: I found 5 AI content detectors that can correctly identify AI text 100% of the time\nI'm sorry, OpenAI. I have to fail you on this test. You would have passed if the only error was not using the plural of \"line\" when appropriate. But the fact that it gave me back a non-working plugin on the first try is fail territory, even if the AI did eventually make it work on the second try.\nNo matter how you spin it, this is a step back.\n2. Rewriting a string function\nThis second test is designed to rewrite a string function to better check for dollars and cents. The original code that GPT-5 was asked to rewrite did not allow for cents (it only checked for integers).\nGPT-5 did fine with this test. It did return a minimal result because it didn't do any error checking. It didn't check for non-string input, extra whitespace, thousands separators, or currency symbols.\nBut that's not what I asked for. I told it to rewrite a function, which itself did not have any error checking. GPT-5 did exactly what I asked with no embellishment. I'm kind of glad of that because it doesn't know whether or not code prior to this routine already did that work.\nGPT-5 passed this test.\n3. Finding an annoying bug\nThis test came about because I was struggling with a less-than-obvious bug in my code. Without going into the weeds about how the WordPress framework works, the obvious answer is not the right answer.\nYou need some fairly arcane knowledge about how WordPress filters pass their information. This test has been a stumbling block for more than a few AI LLMs.\nAlso: Gen AI disillusionment looms, according to Gartner's 2025 Hype Cycle report\nGPT-5, however, like GPT-4 and GPT-4o before it, did understand the problem. It articulated a clear solution.\nGPT-5 passed this test.\n4. Writing a script\nThis test asks the AI to incorporate a fairly obscure Mac scripting tool called Keyboard Maestro, as well as Apple's scripting language AppleScript, and Chrome scripting behavior.\nIt's really a test of the reach of the AI in terms of knowledge, its understanding of how web pages are constructed, and the ability to write code across three interlinked environments.\nQuite a few AIs have failed this test, but the failure point is usually a lack of knowledge about Keyboard Maestro. GPT-3.5 didn't know about Keyboard Maestro. But ChatGPT has been passing this test since GPT-4. Until now.\nWhere should we start? Well, the good news is that GPT-5 handled the Keyboard Maestro part of the problem just fine. But it got the coding so wrong that it even doubled down on its lack of understanding of how case works in AppleScript.\nIt actually invented a property. This is one of those cases where an AI confidently presents an answer that is completely wrong.\nAlso: ChatGPT comes with personality presets now - and other upgrades you might have missed\nAppleScript is natively case-insensitive. If you want AppleScript to pay attention to case, you need to use a \"considering case\" block. So, this happened.\nThe reason the error message referred to the title of one of my articles is because that was the front window in Chrome. This function checks the front window and does stuff based on the title.\nBut misunderstanding how case works wasn't the only AppleScript error GPT-5 generated. It also referenced a variable named searchTerm without defining it. That's pretty much an error-creating practice in any programming language.\nFail, fail, fail, McFaildypants.\nThe internet hath spoken\nOpenAI seemed to suffer from the same hubris that its AIs do. It confidently moved everyone to GPT-5 and burned the bridges back to GPT-4o. I'm paying $200 a month for a ChatGPT Pro account. On Friday, I couldn't move back to GPT-4o for coding work. Neither could anyone else.\nThere was, however, just a tiny bit of user pushback on the whole bridges burning thing. And by tiny, I mean the entire frickin' internet. So, by Saturday, ChatGPT had a new option.\nTo get to this, go to your ChatGPT settings and turn on \"Show legacy models.\" Then, as it has always been, just drop down the model menu and choose the one you want. Note: this option is only available to those on paid tiers. If you're using ChatGPT for free, you'll take what you're given, and you'll love it.\nEver since the whole generative AI thing kicked off at the beginning of 2023, ChatGPT has been the gold standard of programming tools, at least according to my LLM testing.\nAlso: Microsoft rolls out GPT-5 across its Copilot suite - here's where you'll find it\nNow? I'm really not sure. This is only a day or so after GPT-5 has been released, so its results will probably get better over time. But for now, I'm sticking with GPT-4o for coding, although I do like the deep reasoning capabilities in GPT-5.\nWhat about you? Have you tried GPT-5 for programming tasks yet? Did it perform better or worse than previous versions like GPT-4o or GPT-3.5? Were you able to get working code on the first try, or GPT-4o did you have to guide it through fixes? Are you going to use GPT-5 for coding or stick with older models? Let us know in the comments below.\nYou can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

New iPhones are weeks away, and it's likely we'll see new Apple Watches, and possibly new AirPods Pro and a HomeHub device.\nAlso: The best Apple deals right now: Save on MacBooks, iPhones, and more\nFor the savvy buyer, this situation means that there are a lot more items on the \"don't buy\" list than usual. But fear not, as this guide will ensure you don't spend your money on something outdated in a few weeks.\nTariffs and trade wars\nTariffs still dominate the news. One moment they're on, next they're off, then they're on again with a list of ifs, buts, and exceptions that may or may not stick around.\nCNET: Tracking tariff prices: See how the new tariffs are hitting these 11 popular products\nAccording to Apple's July 31 earnings call, tariffs have cost the company approximately $800 million for the last quarter, with this figure expected to rise to $1.1 billion for the current quarter. So far, Apple is shouldering that burden.\nSo far.\nUpcoming Apple products to keep an eye on (near and far)\n1. AirPods Pro update\nI love my AirPods Pro, and if the rumors are correct, and the updated hardware gets heart rate and temperature tracking, and possibly live translation, then I have to say that I'll be at the front of the queue to get new buds.\n2. M5 Chip\nIt feels like the M4 processor in the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air is still new. However, the M5 chip is already on the horizon. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in the Power On newsletter, the M5 will be in the MacBook Pro and iPad Pro later this year, most likely in the fall.\n3. Apple TV\nIt's coming, we're just not sure when. The device is rumored to use Apple's new networking chip, adding support for Wi-Fi 6E, and will be powered by the A15 chip, opening the door to Apple Intelligence features.\n4. AirTag Update\nI'm a massive AirTag fan, and since Apple released them, the market has exploded with third-party offerings. While only Apple can offer precision finding, there are now smaller, thinner, and even rechargeable finder tags.\nAlso: Should you buy the iPhone 16 or iPhone 17? How to decide which model to buy\nThe new AirTags are expected to use a new Ultra Wideband chip, bringing improved range and accuracy. Apple is also allegedly making the speaker more difficult to disable, serving as a countermeasure to prevent tags from being used to stalk people.\nGiven how easily AirTags can be modified and how they can even be purchased pre-modified, this update will be a welcome change.\nThe 'don't buy' list\nYou should give these Apple devices a pass for now, as we'll likely see refreshed versions soon:\n- iPhones: New models will arrive September/October, so unless you don't mind running old hardware in a few weeks, hold off buying for now. The only exception here is the iPhone 16e that launched in March.\n- Apple Watch: It's likely new hardware will drop alongside the refreshed iPhone, so hold for now.\n- Apple TV: Last updated in October 2022, this device is due for a refresh. Rumors suggest a fourth-gen Apple TV 4K will be announced soon.\n- HomePod Mini: Released in October 2020, this is officially Apple's oldest product. While there's nothing technically wrong with the device, it's hard to recommend paying full price for such old hardware.\n- Vision Pro: It's hard to bet against Apple, and it's tough to put something with so much potential on the naughty list. However, if rumors are true that Apple will halt production because sales have slumped, it's hard to have faith in the product. I'd hold out and see what Apple has planned. Current rumors point to a 2026 refresh.\nThe 'do buy' list\nThese Apple devices are worth springing for now, since it'll be a while before we see significant hardware upgrades.\n1. iPhone 16e\nThis is Apple's newest entry-level iPhone, replacing the iPhone SE line. This is a handset cut back to the bare minimum -- packing an A18 processor, Face ID biometrics, USB-C charging, and a single-lens rear camera.\n2. iPad and iPad Air\nThe iPad Air, kitted out with the M3 chip, received a refresh in March. Prices start at $599 for the 11-inch version and $799 for the 13-inch version. At the time, the iPad also got a performance boost thanks to the A16 chip. Prices for this tablet start at $350.\n3. MacBook Air\nBoth the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air laptops got an upgrade in March 2025 to the 10-core CPU/10-core GPU M4 processor, and battery life is boosted to as much as 18 hours. Prices start at $999, but you can push the cost to $2,399 with upgrades.\n4. Mac Studio\nApple's pro-grade alternative to the Mac mini also saw a serious processing boost in March 2025, with the M4 Max and M3 Ultra offered in a range of configurations. Prices start at $1,999 but can reach $14,099 for a fully tricked-out system.\n5. Apple iMac\nThe M4 iMac received a refresh to bring it up to speed with Apple Intelligence in October 2024. With specs ranging from an eight-core CPU and GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage priced at $1,299, all the way up to a 10-core CPU and GPU, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $1,899, there's an iMac to suit most workloads and budgets.\n6. Apple Mac Mini\nApple's smallest Mac got an upgrade in October 2024 to the M4 and M4 Pro processors. It's also the cheapest Mac you can buy, as a Mac Mini with the 10-core CPU and GPU model, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage costs only $599.\n7. Apple iPad Mini\nThe 2024 iPad Mini was introduced in October 2024, replacing the three-year-old model with one powered by an A17 Pro chip that's Apple Intelligence-ready. The device comes in a range of colors, blue, purple, starlight, and space gray, and multiple storage capacities: 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. Prices range from $499 to $799.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

Well, the company has since proved its point: the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable is now available to consumers for an eye-watering $3,300, but packed with premium design elements, solid hardware, and a 120Hz OLED display that extends to almost 17 inches at the press of a button.\nAlso: Lenovo's $3,000 rollable ThinkBook laptop is officially available to buy - know this before you do\nI've been using the ThinkBook Plus for over a week as my main laptop, and I have to admit, I'm enamored by the extendable screen, particularly as a productivity machine for work.\nBut as the first of its kind, it's far from perfect. There are a handful of trade-offs due to the laptop's form, and the sky-high price invites a critical eye to every element of its design. That being said, it is ultimately a well-engineered laptop. Let's take a closer look.\nLike all ThinkBooks, the laptop exudes business, featuring a metallic, two-tone design. It's not my favorite aesthetic, but it's certainly durable and resists fingerprints way better than all the matte black designs out there.\nUpon first glance, the laptop looks like any other. One of the first things to stand out is the thick bezels framing the display, but as your eye draws to the bottom, you notice something strange: there's no bottom bezel -- the screen just continues below the keyboard.\nAlso: How to buy a laptop for school, work, or gaming (and our top picks for each)\nThe rest of the rollable screen is parked underneath, waiting to be unfurled. With the push of a button, the standard-sized display extends upwards, increasing the screen size to 16.7 inches.\nThe result is a large, portrait-style display that goes far beyond any other standard laptop screen size on the market. The glossy, OLED screen delivers a fantastic picture, with no flickering or dimming around the edges, although there is some visible creasing that looks like what you'd see on a foldable phone's display.\nThis is especially true if you rotate the glossy display to reflect the light. It's a little more visible than I expected and certainly something of note (given the price), but ultimately, it doesn't really overshadow the benefit of the large screen.\nFor example, you stop noticing the creasing when your attention is focused on what you're actually doing. It's one of those things that's an inevitable part of its mechanics -- it took foldable phones several years to reduce the creasing on their displays -- and although it doesn't exactly scream \"premium\", it doesn't cancel out the benefits the screen provides.\nAlso: I tried Lenovo's infamous 'rollable' laptop at CES - it's more practical than I thought\nSo what are the said benefits? First off, the extra room is a breath of fresh air. It allows for a spacious workspace that I have to admit, makes for a very nice user experience. Personally, I like running one large, full-screen desktop, but you can also put two windows, one on top of the other, for two 16:9 desktops.\nTo maximize real estate, I set the scale in Windows to 125%, bringing the UI down to a more manageable size that results in a crisp and efficient interface. However, if you want a larger UI, it still feels more roomy than a regular laptop display.\nIf you're a programmer, you'll appreciate the extended portrait orientation, but anyone who works with documents will love being able to see a third more content on the screen at a glance.\nAs an editor, it drastically improves working in Google Docs and my browser-based CMS, both of which benefit from more visibility without having to squint at a UI that's been scaled down to the atomic level.\nEven basic web browsing is improved, with more of the page on the screen at once, and more content visible with less scrolling. In that sense, the display mirrors the mobile layout, which is ultimately more scrollable.\nRolling the screen up can be done by pressing the associated key or with a hand gesture in front of the webcam. While it's extending, the screen defaults to playing an animation (different ones are selectable in settings) with some thematic music, then reloading your desktop once it reaches the desired size. The music can be a little much in a quiet office, so luckily, all of these features can be turned off.\nWhen fully extended, the bottom third of the screen is occupied by the Lenovo widget panel, which shows reminders, your to-do list, and a calendar at a glance. You can pin this to stay permanently on or have it hide behind your other apps.\nThere's actually a lot of content here, including short videos that show how to use gesture controls to raise and lower the display and some suggestions on how to organize the screen more effectively.\nBeyond the display, the rest of the laptop's core components are quite nice. The keyboard is a little shallow, but the keys feel great, with a satisfying click that's crisp and responsive.\nI was also thrilled to find the haptic trackpad to be just as well-engineered, with a uniform click no matter where you press down on the pad, and a sensitive input for swipe gestures. One thing to note, however, is that in cooler temperatures, you might have some trouble with the pad recognizing your fingers, especially if they're cold.\nAlso: The Lenovo ThinkPad streak is over: This model I tested bucks a decade-long trend (for the better)\nAlso note that the laptop's form factor limits its I/O access, with just two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports and a headphone jack. All three ports are located on the left side of the device, which might be problematic for some users, but is an expected trade-off for the features.\nAll in all, the laptop's core physical build feels premium (if a little chunky), and even without the rollable display, it would be a solid office laptop. The fingerprint reader on the power key, along with support for Wi-Fi 7 seal the deal as a modern business device.\nUnder the hood, the Intel Core Ultra 7 \"Lunar Lake\" processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage make for a standard hardware loadout comparable to any number of mid-to-upper range business laptops. The big display is powered by an integrated Intel Arc 140V GPU with 16GB of internal memory, supplying more than enough power for daily use.\nCinebench 24 MC | Geekbench 6.2.2 SC | Geekbench 6.2.2 MC | |\nThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable | 563 | 2,732 | 10,701 |\nDell 14 Premium | 732 | 2,626 | 15,462 |\nAcer Swift 16 AI | 518 | 2,743 | 10,932 |\nIf you're looking to game on this laptop, it can handle some mainstream titles, but it's not exactly built for running top-tier gaming content. In \"normal\" laptop mode, you've got a 2000 x 1600 resolution, standard fare for a 14-inch. But if your game supports a 2000 x 2350 resolution, you can play with the screen fully extended, which definitely feels like a unique experience, but because of all the screen space, it isn't exactly optimized for high-APM gaming.\nIf you're playing an older game that doesn't support that resolution, well, the game will simply revert to the traditional resolution, resulting in empty space below the window and negating the whole point of the extended display. The bottom line here: gaming can be a bonus for this laptop, but not what it's made for.\nAlso: Finally, a Windows laptop that I wouldn't mind putting away my MacBook Pro for\nRegarding battery life, the display expectedly cuts into the 66Whr battery's longevity, although not as much as you might expect. During normal use, you can get a full work day of use out of it with the screen extended, but it's cutting it close. If you add in videoconferencing and more demanding workloads, you might not make it through the day without a power top-up.\nThat being said, the Lunar Lake chip does allow for the battery loss to reduce to a trickle when not in use, and it charges fast: about 80% in an hour. In our video playback test, we got a little over 11 hours at half brightness in balanced mode over Wi-Fi.\nSo let's address the elephant in the room: the price. Lenovo is well aware that this laptop is not for everyone. In fact, it's probably the most niche product I've reviewed all year. Instead, it's more about proving a point.\nAlso: I've tested dozens of ThinkPads: Here's the Lenovo model I keep coming back to\nLenovo wants to project a reputation of innovation, but more importantly, it wants to prove it can deliver said products to market. This device reflects that mission, earning it an important place in Lenovo's portfolio, even if it's not the year's top seller.\nIt's also the first iteration of this rollable concept, and as such, the physical design is not quite as polished as you'd find in Lenovo's other high-end laptops, like the ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition or the X1 Carbon. These laptops come from a product line backed up by decades of design and engineering, with the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 having room to improve in subsequent model versions.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 is an impressive product, even considering its trade-offs. The display has visible creases and thick bezels, but when it's fully extended, you forget about them. The battery isn't the best, but it's far from the worst. It's not a stellar gaming rig, but that's not why you buy a ThinkBook, anyway.\nIt's niche, and it's expensive, but it does what it's supposed to: deliver a fantastic user experience in the office, with an expansive, flexible display that looks great, pairs nicely with a premium haptic touchpad, and just the right amount of power under the hood.\nAlso: I switched to the Dell 14 Premium for two weeks, and it made my XPS laptop look bad\nAt $3,200, this isn't a mainstream laptop, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you're absolutely sold on the extendable display and are committed to the form factor in the long term.\nThe reality is that you can get almost anything for less: a MacBook Pro M4 with 24GB of RAM, or the new brand-new Dell 14 Premium with the same processor and an upgraded Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU for $1,000 less. But if you're in love with the big screen, I can say that it's a productivity game-changer in the office."

I compared it with a traditional Wi-Fi router, and here's my advice\nWith the adoption of remote and hybrid working, having a reliable internet connection at home is imperative -- not just for one device, but for several. If you have a family, maybe even dozens. So what's better, one single access point, or a mesh network spread about the home?\nThe answer depends on how your home and office are set up and what kind of connection you need. Wi-Fi routers are so good these days that a single access point is often the most straightforward solution. But if you have a larger home or your office is located far away from your router, a mesh network could be a game-changer, boosting the signal no matter where you are.\nAlso: The best VPN routers of 2025\nIf you're not sure of the difference, that's okay, too. Let's examine both types of connection and consider their pros and cons to determine which one is best for you.\nWhat is a traditional Wi-Fi router?\nA traditional router acts as a central hub for internet connectivity. The router acquires the connection from your internet service provider (ISP), and then allows other devices around the home to connect to it, either via Wi-Fi, or by simply plugging in an Ethernet cable. Typically, routers are password-protected so only your household can connect to it.\nYou should buy a traditional Wi-Fi router if...\n1. You're on a budget\nStandard routers are generally much more affordable than mesh network products. While you can still expect to pay a hundred dollars or more for a premium router, there are many budget-friendly options stable enough to keep your home office running effectively without further input.\n2. You have heavy bandwidth and speed requirements\nMany routers today, such as the TP-Link AXE5400 are designed with the technology needed to meet heavy bandwidth and streaming requirements. Some, like the Asus RT-BE86U, aim to exceed the requirements of most people for the fastest connection possible.\nAlso: Should you upgrade to Wi-Fi 7? Here's my verdict after testing this next-gen router at home\nGamers and live streamers, for example, should generally stick with wired Ethernet connections and traditional routers, as they will likely provide improved speeds and stability over wireless-first products.\n3. You want a plug-and-play product\nA standard router is often less hassle to set up than a mesh network. For something that \"just works,\" a typical router might be the best option. Set it up once, make sure updates are automatically applied, and forget about it.\n4. You want to separate devices and networks\nYou can set up guest Wi-Fi networks on most modern routers, but if you also want to keep all of your devices on a separate home network in the interests of security, most routers will allow you to do this without much hassle.\nWhat is a mesh router?\nWhile traditional routers are singular, centralized access points, mesh networking devices are decentralized.\nInstead of one device connecting to a single gateway to the internet, mesh networks are created from multiple Wi-Fi nodes that all provide web connectivity. For example, you could have a central hub in the kitchen and satellite nodes in the home office, kitchen, and bedroom.\nAlso: This is the fastest and most expensive Wi-Fi router I've ever tested\nWhen you access the internet while in the kitchen, you would automatically connect to the hub, whereas you would jump on a node while you're in your home office, and so on -- and this blanket coverage is why mesh devices are great for larger homes or offices. Most mesh systems will automatically select the best channels and nodes to avoid dead zones and lower the risk of poor connectivity.\nYou should buy a mesh networking system if...\n1. You have spotty coverage in your home\nThe main benefit of a mesh network is extended coverage. Investing in a mesh setup will remove annoyances, such as coverage blackspots or slow connections in larger properties with a lot of square feet. You're far less likely to have dead zones with a mesh system than you are with a single router access point.\nMesh networks can often cover up to 5,000 sq. ft., and more, with enough satellites. That's far more than you can expect from one central router.\n2. You need a reliable connection, no matter where you are\nAs your device will connect to the nearest satellite node rather than a central point of access, this feature helps ensure that -- no matter where you are in a property -- you are less likely to experience connectivity failures or drops.\nAlso: I switched my high-end Wi-Fi 7 router to a more affordable option - and don't regret it\nIn this manner, mesh networks are particularly useful if you have a home office in a garden area separate from your house, for example.\nAnother benefit is that mesh systems and satellites are often designed to look modern, sleek, and may be more discreet than bulky, traditional routers, giving you more options for placement.\n3. You want additional controls\nOnce a mesh network is active, many vendors allow users to control their system through a mobile app. This could include keeping an eye on network traffic, rebooting, or even turning off the internet entirely -- perhaps an appealing prospect for those with children who don't want to mess with a typical router's configuration. In addition, some mesh networks also act as smart hubs and are compatible with voice assistants.\nA note of warning, however: you may need to spend some time tweaking configuration settings when you first set up a mesh network.\nFAQs\nWhat are the disadvantages of using a Wi-Fi router?\nThere are three key disadvantages of using a traditional Wi-Fi router:\nCoverage issues: As internet access is distributed through a single point, this setup can mean that areas far away from your router will have slow or spotty connections that drop. Range extenders can help remove this barrier, and while they can still be cheaper than investing in a mesh network, it's an additional expense.\nOverload: Unless extenders or channel separation features are used, too many connections may result in overloading, bottlenecks, lags, and connectivity drops.\nTweaking: If you want to tweak the more advanced settings on a router, this can often require annoying visits to a platform via desktop, rather than the seamless mobile app connectivity we have learned to enjoy for many of our modern services.\nWhat router system is best for my home office?\nYou need to decide whether the financial outlay for a whole mesh network is worth it. In larger homes with dead spots, mesh networking can provide a way to improve your Wi-Fi signal strength and coverage immediately.\nHowever, it can be expensive to overhaul your existing router setup for a large home. Going for a complete mesh system may be overkill unless you consistently have multiple users and connected devices competing for bandwidth.\nA Wi-Fi extender can be a worthwhile investment instead if you decide to stay with a traditional home router but need to expand coverage.\nSome mesh network systems, such as Google Wifi, Netgear Orbi, and Amazon Eero, are relatively cheap to set up if you don't need too many satellites.\nAlso: The best mesh Wi-Fi routers: Expert recommended\nIf you're the only person using your network and need a stable, powerful internet connection -- such as for resource-hungry work applications or gaming -- a traditional router and an Ethernet cable may be all you need for reliable and rapid internet access. Wired internet speeds should be quicker than wireless if the connection is working properly, and investing in a simple Ethernet cable, easy to find for no more than $10 or $15, could be enough. This could save you the cost of a complete overhaul.\nWi-Fi range extenders, too, could be considered an alternative to mesh if you need to boost coverage and throughput in some areas, and they will likely be less expensive than purchasing individual mesh nodes. Some vendors also offer mesh \"bolt-ons,\" such as Asus' AiMesh, which creates a mesh-like coverage wireless network without ripping everything out and starting again. However, the downside is that you will probably have to spend some time setting these bolt-ons up and tampering with your router's configurations.\nIs mesh Wi-Fi better for gaming?\nThe best way to answer this question is to consider latency. Overall, many mesh systems today trade extended coverage for potential downgrades to speed.\nIf your household has gamers using consoles casually, it shouldn't matter what type of router you use. However, professional and dedicated gamers will absolutely notice small lags or latency issues -- and they will want the best speed and stability available. In these cases, a wired, traditional router is likely your best bet.\nI prefer an Ethernet, cabled connection for PC, Internet-based gaming and sessions with friends, and while my mesh network would probably be adequate, I don't want to risk lagging.\nIs mesh Wi-Fi better than an extender?\nWhile both mesh Wi-Fi and extenders will improve the coverage of your home, there are disadvantages to both.\nMesh systems require investment and the cost can add up quickly, but they provide seamless transitions between Wi-Fi access points dotted around your home. Furthermore, you can rapidly change settings or perform updates via mobile apps.\nWi-Fi extenders can't be tweaked so easily. However, they are cheaper and are the best option if you just want to tackle a few dead zones, as you just need to plug one into your main router. Keep in mind that, unlike mesh nodes, Wi-Fi extenders won't improve congestion or eradicate bottlenecks.\nCheck your ISP first\nBefore changing your setup, you should review your ISP package. If you're subscribed to a low-speed offering, or your internet provider throttles your speed at peak times, new equipment is not going to help. Instead, a package upgrade could be a better option.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

At the same time, the hardware expands on both the low and high end, with the lowest-tier configuration of the M4 equipped with a 10-core CPU and 8-core GPU, in contrast to the 8-core M3 chip from last year.\nAlso: Every Mac model that supports MacOS 26 Tahoe (and which aren't compatible)\nOn the other hand, the high-end configuration offers 32GB of unified memory, which was previously capped out at 24GB on last year's M3. This combination of improvements for base components and a lower starting cost is strategic positioning on Apple's part to incentivize the new devices and stay competitive in an increasingly crowded market.\nThe MacBook Air M4 is a fantastic device, but it's also a natural continuation of the product line, which some might see as a \"boring\" update. Depending on who you ask, that could be a good or a not-so-good thing. You can't fix what isn't broken, but I think there is some room here for a few more bold design choices.\nOne of the most obvious is the MacBook Air M4's new colorway, Sky Blue, which is a very subtle blue; a very cautious decision when I was expecting something a little closer to Microsoft's Surface Laptop. All that being said, there are certainly some features on the M4 MacBook Air that set this year's ultraportable apart. Let's break them down.\nTriple-screen threat\nOne of the most anticipated and sought-after features of the MacBook Air M4 is its ability to support two external monitors while the lid is open. This alone opens up new possibilities for work, productivity, and creative tasks and makes the MacBook Air more competitive with three working displays.\nAlso: MacOS 26 envy? 4 best features that Windows PC users can already use\nThe laptop's own display still looks great, as well. Apple's Liquid Retina technology provides crisp, well-defined text, smooth, vibrant video, and support for 1 billion colors. Maxing out at 500 nits of brightness, the display on the Air M4 doesn't get as bright as the MacBook Pro, but it's still bright enough for the majority of use cases.\nI am a little surprised there isn't an option to upgrade the M4 Air with the nano-textured glass we saw on the M4 MacBook Pro, however. Maybe we're a bit spoiled now, but the glare is noticeable enough for me to wonder why, of all the possible things you can upgrade this laptop with, that isn't one of them.\nThe other thing about the display I don't love is the notch for the camera, which results in a chunk of otherwise valuable screen real estate blacked out where the lens is located. If you keep the toolbar toggled on, it's something you can get used to, but with apps in full-screen it's definitely noticeable.\nProductivity powerhouse\nWhile on the topic of productivity, the MacBook Air M4 excels at more than just multiple displays. For one thing, videoconferencing on the Air is a joy. The webcam's hardware got an upgrade, from the 1080p FaceTime camera from last year to a 12MP camera on the M4 Air with Apple's new Center Stage feature.\nAlso: I traded my business computer for a Lenovo Legion laptop for work, and didn't miss it\nWe first saw Center Stage on the MacBook Pro and iMac last fall, and its addition to the Air is one of the many features that bring the ultraportable a little closer to its older Pro sibling. If you're unfamiliar with it, Center Stage keeps you focused and centered in the frame no matter how you're positioned, handling the visual logistics of the call with minimal input from the user.\nTo me, it seems less like a standalone feature in its own right and more like the inevitable future of webcam technology. This is how webcams should work, and Apple's innovation here presents a polished experience that is equally enjoyable for work or personal calls on FaceTime.\nThe combination of top-tier hardware, a seamless and well-integrated product, and quality-of-life features just makes the video call experience overall better on a Mac.\nAlso: Prime Day is over, but some of our favorite deals are still live now\nI use a Windows device as my daily driver, and although I've used Macs for years in the past, I forgot how effortlessly the MacBook Air can handle multitasking through a combination of the Launchpad, split screen, and talking directly to Siri. Additionally, improvements to how windows are tiled are satisfying for those of us who like our desktops arranged in a particular way.\nReliable, all-day battery\nThe MacBook Air is still a battery-efficient device, and although Apple's Silicon line of processors set the standard for battery performance in ultraportable laptops, the rest of the market has had some time to catch up.\nThat doesn't mean the MacBook Air has fallen behind, but it does have some competitors now. During my testing of the M4, I got over 14 hours of battery life with the device running a 4K video at half brightness, which is about where I expected it to be and about the same as last year's MacBook Air M3.\nBy contrast, Microsoft's Surface Laptop got over 15 hours during the same test, and Asus' Zenbook A14 came in closer to 20. The latter, of course, doesn't match the power on board the MacBook Air M4, but it is lighter, thinner, and packs a gorgeous display. That alone puts it in competition territory.\nYes, the MacBook Pro M4 will last longer as well, but the Air is thinner and lighter and much less variable: the difference in battery drain is minimal depending on what tasks you're putting it through (barring persistent, intense workloads).\nAlso: I replaced my AirPods for an unlikely alternative at work - here's why it's my new favorite\nThe bottom line is that for users who commute into the office a few times a week, you can reliably count on the MacBook Air M4 to last the whole day if you forget your charger, even if you're taking a few video calls.\nBenchmarking\nPutting all that hardware to the test, the MacBook Air M4 performed very well in our benchmarking, coming in very close to both the MacBook Pro M4 and MacBook Pro M3. As these devices leave their predecessors from just a few years ago in the dust, they get a little bit closer to each other.\nCinebench 24 MC | Geekbench 6.2.2 SC | Geekbench 6.2.2 MC | |\nApple MacBook Air M4 | 888 | 3,587 | 14,972 |\nApple MacBook Pro M4 | 1,000 | 3,823 | 14,849 |\nApple MacBook Pro M3 | 906 | 3,072 | 11,623 |\nApple MacBook Pro with M1 Pro | 828 | 2,211 | 12,482 |\nSo what about the things I wish Apple did differently? Well, many of my gripes about the MacBook Air M4 are nothing new. For one, there are still only two USB-C ports, both of which are on the left-hand side of the device. If this felt limiting for you before, not much has changed.\nAlso: I finally replaced my M1 MacBook Pro with a base model M4 - and the upgrades were worth it\nSecond, Apple's devices remain some of the most locked-down when it comes to repairability, keeping consumers strictly bound to Apple's repair and service model by barring the use of salvaged components. The company has made strides toward a greener business model when it comes to production, but a loosening of the strict control over parts replacement would go even further.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe MacBook Air M4 is still one of the most complete packages you can ask for when it comes to creativity, productivity, and everyday use. The M4 Air's sleek and lightweight form factor set the standard for ultraportables, and not much has changed with its design since, for better or for worse.\nIf you have an iPhone and enjoy Apple's ecosystem of products, the MacBook Air is a solid choice as a main driver. If you already have a Mac that's more than a few years old, the MacBook Air M4 will feel like a significant upgrade. If you have an M2 Pro or M3, the leap will feel less noticeable. If you're coming from an older Windows device, well, you'll wonder how you ever took calls on your 720p webcam at all.\nConsidering all of this, the MacBook Air M4 is a modest upgrade from its predecessor but pushes the line forward overall. In fact, with burgeoning Apple Intelligence features, the same camera technology as the MacBook Pro M4, upgraded hardware, and a lower starting price, the MacBook Air seems like the most logical choice for a new Apple laptop in 2025."

You have 5 options - and 2 months to decide\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Windows 10 support ends on Oct. 14, 2025.\n- Users have free and paid options for extended updates.\n- Doing nothing is not a safe option.\nHave you decided what to do with your Windows 10 PCs when they reach their official end-of-support date in two months?\nI can tell you with absolute certainty that Microsoft is not going to back down at the last minute and extend that deadline. But you do have options, including some new ways to continue getting security updates for an extra year, at no cost, thanks to an announcement Microsoft made in late June. Don't procrastinate, though -- you'll need to take action in the next 60 days to stay secure.\nAlso: How to get free Windows 10 security updates through Oct. 2026\nEven if you and your business aren't affected by this deadline, it's likely that you have friends and family members who own older PCs that are still perfectly functional but can't be upgraded to Windows 11. They've probably been ignoring warning messages for a few months now, but those messages are going to get more insistent as the deadline approaches. You can help them out by sending them a link to this article.\nWhat does 'end of support' mean?\nFor nearly a quarter-century, Microsoft has had a formal policy of supporting each major operating system release for 10 years. Windows 10 was released in 2015, so its 10 years are up, as expected, in 2025.\nThe end date is right there on the Microsoft Support document that lists products retiring or reaching the end of support in 2025. Every retail edition of Windows, as well as the Enterprise and Education editions, is slated for retirement.\nThat schedule is defined by Microsoft's Modern Lifecycle Policy, which is documented on the Microsoft Lifecycle page: \"Windows 10 will reach end of support on October 14, 2025. The current version, 22H2, will be the final version of Windows 10, and all editions will remain in support with monthly security update releases through that date.\" In a separate support article, Microsoft reiterates that as of October 14, 2025, it will no longer provide technical support or security and reliability fixes for PCs running Windows 10.\nAlso: How to upgrade an 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 - 2 free options\nWhen a Windows version reaches its end-of-support date, the software keeps working, but Windows Update stops delivering security and reliability fixes:\n[There] will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service. Paid programs may be available for applicable products.\nThat part in the middle sounds encouraging, doesn't it? \"Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.\" Unfortunately, that's not a supported option for customers running Windows 10 on hardware that doesn't meet the stringent hardware compatibility requirements of Windows 11. If you try to upgrade one of those PCs to Windows 11, you'll encounter an error message.\nAlso: Windows 11 should have been an easy upgrade - Microsoft chose to unleash chaos on us instead\nThat end-of-support deadline is not going to change. Neither are the hardware standards. If you're responsible for one or more Windows 10 PCs that fail Microsoft's Windows 11 compatibility tests, what should you do? You have five options.\n1. Sign up for extended security updates\nDo you remember the official support document that I quoted earlier? The one that says there will be \"no new security updates\" after Windows 10 reaches its end-of-support date? That's not exactly true.\nMicrosoft will indeed continue developing security updates for Windows 10, but they won't be free for everyone. Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for Windows 10 will be available on a subscription basis for up to three years.\nHow much are these paid-for updates going to cost? That depends.\nIf you're an administrator at an educational institution with a deployment of Windows 10 Education edition, you're in luck. Those extended updates will cost a mere pittance: $1 per machine for the first year, $2 for the second year, and $4 for the third and final year, taking you all the way to October 2028.\nAlso: I replaced my Microsoft account password with a passkey - and you should, too\nIT pros who manage a fleet of business PCs aren't so lucky and will need to pay dearly to stick with Windows 10. A license for the Extended Security Updates program is sold as a subscription. For the first year, the cost is $61. For year two, the price doubles, and it doubles again for year three. Do the math, and the cost is staggering: a three-year ESU subscription will cost $61 + $122 + $244, for a total of $427.\nConsumers have the option to receive security updates for one additional year after the end-of-support date, with the deadline pushing out to October 2026. The list price for that subscription is $30 a year, but you can cut the cost to zero by using Microsoft Rewards points earned by using the Bing search engine or the Windows Backup tool. (For details, see How to get Windows 10 extended security updates for free: 2 options.) That's a great deal compared to what business customers have to pay, but the consumer ESU subscription is only good for one year. At the end of that year, you'll have an unsupported PC once again, so make sure you use that year to figure out your exit strategy.\n2. Buy a new PC (or rent a virtual PC)\nMicrosoft and its partners would like you to replace that unsupported hardware with a new PC. You might even be tempted by one of the shiny new Copilot+ PCs, with their custom neural processing units, or maybe a powerful gaming PC. But throwing away a perfectly good computer seems wasteful, and it's not an option if you're hanging on to Windows 10 because you have mission-critical software or an expensive hardware device that's incompatible with Windows 11.\nAlso: I never pay full price for PCs or Macs, thanks to these 7 money-saving tricks\nYou also have the option to rent a new virtual PC by signing up for Windows 365, which allows you to connect remotely to your own Windows 11-powered virtual PC in Microsoft's cloud. A Windows 365 subscription works on Windows 10 and includes extended security updates for the host PC for up to three years. Windows 365 isn't cheap (plans start at $28 a month), but that option probably costs less than a new PC.\nFor businesses, replacing a PC that is more than six years old is absolutely the correct option. Ask your CPA about depreciation deductions.\n3. Upgrade your 'incompatible' hardware to Windows 11\nThat pesky compatibility checker might insist that you can't upgrade your Windows 10 PC to Windows 11, but there are indeed documented ways to bypass those restrictions. You just have to jump through a few technical hoops. Frankly, if you have a PC that is less than 10 years old, this is the easiest, cheapest, and most reliable option.\nAlso: The 10 apps I can't live or work without - on Windows, Mac, and mobile\nYou can find all the details in this article: How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11. Here's the short version:\nFor PCs originally designed for Windows 10 (basically anything designed in 2016 or later), you need to make one small registry edit and then ensure that your PC is configured to use Secure Boot with the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) enabled. Even an old TPM 1.2 chip will do. As many readers have confirmed via email, this process works seamlessly as long as you've got those configuration details set properly. This option will work even with PCs that are 10 years old.\nFor older PCs originally designed for Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, you might need to use a third-party tool called Rufus to bypass installation challenges. That's especially true on PCs that use a legacy BIOS instead of UEFI firmware and for those that don't have access to a TPM. Make sure you have the most recent version of Rufus (version 4.6 or later) to work around Microsoft's latest compatibility checks.\nThose upgrade options can't save a device whose CPU lacks support for two specific instruction sets -- POPCNT and SSE 4.2. Most PCs built using Intel CPUs from 2009 or later will pass this test; AMD CPUs from 2015 or later should also be OK. As I note in this article, there is no workaround.\nAlso: How to upgrade from Windows 11 Home to Pro - without overpaying\nIf you do use one of these upgrade hacks, don't be alarmed by the threatening message you might see when trying to do an unsupported upgrade: \"If you proceed with installing Windows 11, your PC will no longer be supported and won't be entitled to receive updates. Damages to your PC due to lack of compatibility aren't covered under the manufacturer warranty.\"\nThat's deliberately misleading language from Microsoft. As I've noted before, that warning doesn't really say that Microsoft is going to cut off your access to updates; it simply says your PC is no longer supported, and you're no longer \"entitled\" to those updates. That word is a tell on Microsoft's part, disclaiming legal responsibility without actually saying what it will do.\nIf you don't want to mess with the registry and you're willing to do a clean install, just use Rufus to create a bootable Windows 11 installation drive, which bypasses the compatibility checker completely. You'll need to restore your data files from a backup or from the cloud, and you'll also need to install your software from scratch, but that's no more difficult than setting up a new PC.\n4. Ditch Windows completely\nYou could keep your old hardware and replace Windows 10 with the flavor of Linux you prefer. If you've got the technical know-how and experience to manage the transition, that option is worth considering. Thanks to Google Workspace, Microsoft 365 and a million or so web-based services, you can do just about all your basic work in a web browser these days. You might not even notice what operating system is running that browser.\nSwitching to Google's free ChromeOS Flex might also be possible, although the compatibility requirements for that alternative are just as likely to get in your way. I wrote about my experience here: Installing ChromeOS Flex? 5 things you need to do first to avoid headaches. As I pointed out, \"If you've got an old PC or Mac and you're thinking of installing ChromeOS Flex on it, don't do anything until you check Google's official ChromeOS Flex certified models list.\"\nAlso: 6 most Windows-like Linux distros because old habits die hard\nPay special attention to the end-of-support date for the PC you're thinking of upgrading. It doesn't make much sense to replace Windows 10 with a release of ChromeOS Flex that's also set to end support in 2025 or earlier.\nSwitching to Linux or some derivative of Linux might be a good way to repurpose an old PC. For consumers and businesses with existing investments in Windows software, it might not be a realistic alternative, but it's worth considering.\n5. Ignore the end-of-support deadline completely\nYou could do nothing at all -- just continue running your unsupported operating system and hope for the best. That's a bad idea that exposes you to the very real possibility that you'll fall prey to a security exploit. Unfortunately, a lot of people are going to do just that. Some percentage of them will end up regretting their decision.\nI've heard from some folks who believe that being extra careful and using third-party antivirus software will protect them from harm. I wouldn't bet my business on that strategy.\nAlso: Stop paying for antivirus software. Here's why you don't need it\nIf you're intent on doing so, consider installing the third-party 0patch agent to deal with any security issues that aren't addressed by Microsoft. The free 0patch personal plan includes patches for known 0-day vulnerabilities, but if you want all Windows 10 patches, or if the PC is used for business or enterprise tasks, you'll need to pay for a 0patch Pro plan at a per-PC rate of \u20ac24.95 per year -- for customers in the US, at current exchange rates, that equates to less than $2.50 a month.\nI wouldn't recommend that for a PC that you use for business, but if you have a device you use for casual tasks at home, you might be willing to take the risk.\nThis article was originally published on Nov. 15, 2021, and is regularly updated to incorporate new information and advice.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter"

With so many configurations and models available today, and the various software and feature implications that come with, the journey of choosing the right model has never been longer. For years, I've tested every iPhone released, including the large-sized iPhone 16 Pro Max and the budget-oriented iPhone 16e, gathering insights on what models resonate with what type of user.\nWith iOS 26 officially out in public beta, and the iPhone 17 series expected to launch in a matter of months, the dynamics of how you decide which iPhone model to buy and how you interact with it have just changed again. Notably, the latest software version will likely not be compatible with some older iPhones, including the iPhone XR and XS. So I'd advise against buying those two models, even if they can be had for less money. Instead, I'd consider your best options below.\nWhat is the best iPhone right now?\nZDNET's mobile experts carefully test every iPhone model at release, putting them through their paces to provide you with the best advice on which model to buy and the key features to look out for when you do. Right now, our pick for the best iPhone overall is the iPhone 16 Pro Max, thanks to its vivid and slim-bezel display, extensive camera tools, including a dedicated Camera Control button, and support for Apple Intelligence features. Should you prefer a smaller, easy-to-handle form factor, consider the iPhone 16 Pro.\nFor most people, the standard iPhone 16 is your best bet if you want the latest iOS 26 features and Camera Control but don't want to spend a thousand dollars. It helps that the base iPhone models this year sport colorful finishes that are sure to appeal.\nAlso: The best phones: Expert tested\nThe best iPhones of 2025\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is the best iPhone overall due to its highly capable specifications and supersized attributes. It's the iPhone model that sets a new standard for Apple every year and continues to be a worthy competitor to Samsung's S Ultra series and Google's Pixel Pro XL.\nWhy we like it: Besides being the largest iPhone Apple currently offers, with a 6.8-inch AMOLED display, the iPhone 16 Pro Max also has the best-rated battery life of 27 hours of video playback. From our tests, we found the phone lasted much longer than the standard 16 Pro and last year's 15 Pro Max.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max looks and feels fairly similar to its predecessor, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as it's also made of titanium instead of the previous versions' stainless steel. This material choice \"makes the Pro phones about 10% lighter (than their predecessors) and is very durable,\" as ZDNET's editor-in-chief, Jason Hiner, describes it.\nThe one notable hardware change comes in the form of a Camera Control key on the right side of the device. Camera Control lets you quickly turn on the camera app, adjust color tones and other photographic settings, and capture pictures and videos. It's a useful tool that, with a bit of practice, can be essential for creative workflows.\nReview: iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max\nWho it's for: The iPhone 16 Pro Max is a flagship phone that commands a flagship price, meaning it's ideal for users who are willing to pay for the best iPhone available, whether that's directly through retailers or through carrier deals. You should buy the Pro Max version if you want the larger screen, enduring battery life, and triple-camera setup.\nWho should look elsewhere: But if you're shopping on a budget and don't mind a smaller screen, consider the $999 iPhone 16 Pro ($200 cheaper and with a 6.1-inch display). If you can live without the dedicated telephoto lens, you can even go with the $899 iPhone 16 Plus, which features a large screen and battery, but only has wide and ultrawide lenses for shooting.\niPhone 16 Pro Max specs: Processor: Apple A18 Pro Bionic | Display size: 6.8 inches with 120 Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB | Rear cameras: 48 MP wide, 48 MP ultra-wide, and 12 MP 5\u00d7 telephoto | Front camera: 12 MP | Colors: Natural Titanium, Desert Titanium, White, Black | Weight: 227 g | Starting price: $1,099\nThe iPhone 16 looks, feels, and performs like a premium phone should. It also starts at $300 less than the iPhone 16 Pro series, putting it in closer reach for most consumers\nWhy we like it: The iPhone 16 brings several premium features from the Pro models -- including the Camera Control key, Dynamic Island, and support for Apple Intelligence -- making it feel closer to a Pro than ever before.\nFrom our hands-on testing with the model, its slimmer, lighter design with curved edges offers a noticeably more comfortable grip than older iPhones, without sacrificing durability or style. Add in solid battery life, the reliable A18 Bionic chip, and a fun lineup of colors, and you've got a well-rounded device that delivers excellent value.\nReview: iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus\nWho it's for: The iPhone 16 is a great choice for anyone who wants a modern iPhone with high-end features but doesn't need -- or want to pay for -- the full Pro experience. If you care about one-handed usability, reliable performance, and a camera that can now shoot macro and spatial videos, the iPhone 16 hits the sweet spot. Opt for the standard size for compact comfort, or go with the Plus model for longer battery life and a bigger screen.\nWho should look elsewhere: If you're a power user who needs features like a telephoto lens, ProMotion (120Hz) display, or more advanced camera tools, you may still want to spring for the iPhone 16 Pro.\nLikewise, if you're coming from an iPhone 14 or newer and don't care much about spatial video or macro photography, the upgrade may feel incremental. Budget-conscious shoppers might also prefer to stick with the iPhone 16e or previous-gen models that still offer strong performance at a lower price.\niPhone 16 specs: Processor: Apple A18 Bionic | Display size: 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | Rear cameras: 48MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide | Front camera: 12MP | Colors: Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, Black | Weight: 170g | Starting price: $799\nGoing off of retail price alone, the latest iPhone 16e is the cheapest iPhone on the market right now. The $599 starting price comes with its caveats, of course, but there are still several iPhone benefits that may interest budget shoppers.\nWhy we like it: From our tests, the iPhone 16e excels in ways that are essential to most users, from the 6.1-inch OLED display that's both comfortable to hold and easy to view content, to the exceptional battery life thanks to the efficiency of the A18 processor, to the single 48MP Fusion camera that's capable of capturing vivid and detailed imagery.\nSure, you'll have to settle with some trade-offs, such as the notched display and lack of MagSafe connectors. Still, the overall experience of the iPhone 16e, which runs on iOS 18 with most Apple Intelligence features, makes it a reliable handset for hundreds less than the flagship iPhones.\nReview: Apple iPhone 16e\nWho it's for: The iPhone 16e is ideal for shoppers who want the quintessential iPhone experience -- FaceTiming in decent camera quality, iMessage texting with the latest chat features, firing up multiple apps in sequence, etc. -- but don't want to spend a grand on a phone. As ZDNET's Sabrina Ortiz said after switching over from an iPhone 16 Pro, \"I am equally impressed as I am surprised.\"\nWho should look elsewhere: The absence of MagSafe was one of our main critiques when testing the iPhone 16e, so if you're already accustomed to the popular accessory mechanic, you'll want to consider alternatives that support the feature, like the iPhone 16 and iPhone 15. The premium iPhone models also offer more flexible camera capabilities, including dedicated telephoto and/or ultrawide lenses.\niPhone SE specs: CPU: Apple A18 | Display: 6.1 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | Internal storage: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | Rear cameras: 48MP wide | Front camera: 12MP | Colors: Black, White | Weight: 167g | Starting price: $599\nWhile Apple has officially discontinued its iPhone Mini models, the iPhone 13 Mini is still your best option if you want a truly small flagship iPhone.\nWhy we like it: The iPhone 13 Mini packs formidable specs by today's standards --including the same A15 Bionic chip found in the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 14 -- into a truly pocketable design. You still get Face ID, 5G, wireless charging, and reliable dual 12MP rear cameras, all for around $250 refurbished.\nFor those who miss the days of one-handed phones without sacrificing performance, our real-world experiences with the 13 Mini have proven it to be a more ergonomic experience than any other iPhone model.\nReview: Apple iPhone 13 Mini\nWho it's for: This is the ideal phone for small phone enthusiasts, minimalists, or anyone who wants flagship-level features in a compact body. It's a great pick if you're willing to buy a refurbished one and want something slightly less outdated than the iPhone SE (2022). The iPhone 13 Mini is also a great option for users who want a spare phone for business or creative purposes.\nWho should look elsewhere: If battery life, screen size, or multitasking are high priorities, the iPhone 13 Mini will fall short. Its smaller display isn't great for media consumption, and the compact battery won't match the endurance of larger models we've tested. Anyone needing the latest features or preferring to buy new might be better off with a current-generation iPhone like the iPhone 15 or iPhone 16e, despite the trade-offs.\niPhone 13 Mini specs: Processor: Apple A15 | Display size: 5.4 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | Rear cameras: Two 12MP (wide and ultra-wide) | Front camera: 12MP | Colors: Starlight, Midnight, Red, Pink, Blue | Weight: 141g | Starting Price: $350\nWhile Apple continues to segment its iPhone line with \"Pro\" and \"Plus\" models, the regular offering, such as the now two-year-old iPhone 15, continues to be a viable option for consumers.\nWhy we like it: The iPhone 15 hits a sweet spot in Apple's lineup, offering many of the features previously reserved for Pro models -- like the Dynamic Island, USB-C charging, and a sleek, contoured design -- at a more accessible price. It's powered by the A16 Bionic chip (the same one used in the iPhone 14 Pro), making it fast and capable for everyday use, from gaming to multitasking.\nBoth the standard and Plus models are also receptive to Apple's iOS 26 update, so you'll gain access to the Liquid Glass redesign, enhanced CarPlay experience, and more. Combine that with one of the brighter Super Retina XDR displays we've measured and an improved 48MP main camera, and you get a phone that feels like a serious upgrade without the Pro price tag.\nReview: Apple iPhone 15\nWho it's for: This is the iPhone for people who want modern features, strong performance, and great cameras without splurging on a Pro model. It's ideal for everyday users who care about photography, video, and overall speed but don't necessarily need a ProMotion display or a telephoto lens.\nStarting at $699 -- or less if you shop around -- it's a smart buy for most people who want a current-generation iPhone that's built to last.\nWho should look elsewhere: Power users who want the absolute best camera setup, a 120Hz display, or advanced editing tools may still prefer the iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro. And if budget is your biggest concern, the iPhone 14 or 16e might be a better fit -- especially if you don't mind sacrificing some modern design touches. Those upgrading from an iPhone 14 may also find the leap a bit underwhelming unless features like USB-C or the 48MP camera are must-haves.\niPhone 15 specs: Processor: Apple A16 | Display size: 6.1 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | Rear cameras: 48MP wide and 12MP ultrawide | Front camera: 12MP | Colors: Blue, Pink, Yellow, Green, Black | Weight: 171g | Starting price: $699\nTop iPhone models compared\nAfter weighing out the specs and reviewer-tested experiences, the best iPhone is currently the iPhone 16 Pro Max. It's got a beautiful AMOLED display, a powerful (and future-proofed) chipset, and a reliable camera system that covers all the bases and angles. Naturally, the 16 Pro Max is also Apple's most expensive model, so if pricing is a concern, consider cheaper options like the iPhone 16e and even older models.\niPhone models compared | Base Price | Base Storage | Display | Processor | Cameras (rear) |\niPhone 16 Pro Max | $1,099 | 128GB | 6.8 inches | A18 Pro | Three |\niPhone 16 | $799 | 128GB | 6.1 inches | A18 | Two |\niPhone 15 | $699 | 128GB | 6.1 inches | A15 | Two |\niPhone 13 Mini | $480 | 128GB | 5.4 inches | A15 | Two |\niPhone 16e | $599 | 128GB | 6.1 inches | A18 | One |\nAre iPhones the best smartphone?\nThe answer depends on your needs and preferences. For example, while the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is ZDNET's current pick for best phone of 2025, it may not be the best option for you if you often rely on services like iMessage and FaceTime, which are exclusive to Apple's operating systems.\nPreviously, the gap between iPhones and Android phones was much larger due to Apple opting for a Lightning port instead of USB-C, but with the iPhone 15 models switching to the more universal port for charging and data transfer, it's become less intimidating to switch from Android to iPhone, and vice versa.\nWhich iPhone model is right for you?\nIt used to be fairly easy to choose an iPhone model as you typically opted for either the \"big\" iPhone or the \"small\" one. With four models available in the iPhone 16 series alone, you now have to dig a bit deeper to choose which is best for you. This is especially true of the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro, which feature nearly the same hardware, so check out our question above for more on this decision.\nSize is generally the first factor to consider, followed by price. Price limits will also drive the amount of internal storage you select for your iPhone.\nOne fantastic aspect of the iPhone is that all models receive software support for years and years, so it's perfectly viable to buy an older model and trust that it will work well for you for quite some time.\nChoose this iPhone... | If you want... |\nApple iPhone 16 Pro Max | The top-of-the-line iPhone experience. Buy the Pro Max if you want the largest iPhone available without any of the compromises found on other models. This variant, along with the Pro, will also support Apple's existing (and upcoming) AI features. |\nApple iPhone 16 | A reliable iPhone that now includes several Pro features. For most users, the standard iPhone 16 should be more than enough. |\nApple iPhone 16e | The iPhone 16e is the cheapest model that Apple officially sells. You'll have to settle with a smaller, MagSafe-less design, but the performance makes up for it. |\nApple iPhone 13 Mini | The only iPhone Mini that Apple makes. This is arguably the best compact smartphone money can buy, even if it's nearly three years old. |\nApple iPhone 15 | An older iPhone that can handle modern-day tasks. The iPhone 15 is still a solid smartphone if you want the Apple experience for less, and it supports USB-C. |\nFactors to consider when choosing an iPhone\nWe chose these smartphones by testing them for weeks and months, evaluating them based on real-world applications like phone calls, messaging, web browsing, and taking way too many pictures and videos.\nZDNET's mobile experts also liaise with industry colleagues and analysts who have hands-on experience with the handsets, sifting through the iPhone pile for the best of the best. Here's the breakdown of what factors we look for.\n- Display: Possibly the most overlooked feature on a smartphone, the display is what you stare at, scroll at, and interact with day in and day out. Therefore, when picking the best iPhones -- no matter the budget -- ZDNET puts an emphasis on devices with above-average panels. Ideally, a good display covers a wide color gamut, is durable, and has a high refresh rate for the smoothest visuals.\n- Performance: One of iPhones' biggest strengths is their in-house silicon, namely the A-series of Apple chipsets. Thanks to this mingling of proprietary hardware and software, we've found the latest iPhones very capable of running the daily and weekly onslaught of apps and services.\n- Camera quality: From group selfies to slow-motion videos, the best iPhones feature camera systems that are reliable and flexible to capture any shot you want. Naturally, an ample amount of storage size is also considered during the selection process.\n- Battery life: For how reliant we've become on smartphones, the top picks on this list are not only able to last you from morning to night but also support fast charging when it's time to top up.\n- Price: What you won't find on this list is a device that's not worth the money or is overcharging you for the hardware-software package you're getting.\nHow we test iPhones\nZDNET's review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every major iPhone release, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and more. Here's a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:\n- Design and ergonomics: How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.\n- Performance: Several factors affect a phone's performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, with all background tasks closed, and with as stable of a mobile connection as possible.\n- Camera quality: ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.\n- Battery life and charging: It's also important for us to evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it (wired, wireless, or both).\n- Special features: These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users, not the opposite.\n- Pricing and availability: Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.\nFor a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive phone testing methodology page.\nLatest news on iPhone\nThere are two major iPhone news stories that you should be aware of right now.\nFirst, Apple just released the public beta of iOS 26, meaning general consumers can now test the upcoming software version ahead of its September (typical) release. iOS 26 introduces key changes to how apps and interfaces are visualized, due to the new Liquid Glass design language, as well as usability enhancements across popular services like Messages, Phone, CarPlay, and Photos.\nOf course, you'll need to use a compatible iPhone model to enroll in the public beta; anything from the iPhone 11 and onward should qualify.\nThe second big news story concerns the iPhone 17 series, which is expected to launch in September in five different models: iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Plus, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone 17 Air (or Slim). Recently, X user @Skyfops shared two images of what can be assumed to be an Apple employee handling a test-development iPhone in California.\nAlso: First look at iPhone 17 Pro? Public images seemingly confirm big design and camera changes\nWhile the product in question is encased in a security cover and privacy screen protector, the unique camera module on the back suggests that the person is holding an iPhone 17 Pro, with the LiDAR sensor and flash embedded on the right side of the device.\nThe rumored horizontal camera bar, considered one of the more significant iPhone hardware changes in recent years, will be a welcome change. It suggests that Apple will give the upcoming iPhone models a noticeable upgrade in camera optics. (It also tells me that the iPhones will rock a little less when set on a table.)\nHow do I take care of my new iPhone?\nThere are several ways you can keep your iPhone clean and pristine.\n- One way is by equipping a protective case and/or screen protector. The best iPhone cases offer reliable drop and scratch protection, won't bulk up the phone, and may feature some extra utility like a kickstand or MagSafe ring. As for screen protectors, tempered glass options are your best bet to keep the display underneath free of scratches and cracks. They're relatively affordable, too, often coming in multipacks for less than $10.\n- Battery management is another key aspect of iPhone maintenance. To keep your device running for as long as possible, consider charging it between 20% to 80% battery. Overcharging the device would otherwise wear down the battery and reduce the health value (found in Settings). When your iPhone battery health is low (anything less than 75% typically is), it would be helpful to get it replaced at an Apple store or by an Apple-authorized technician.\n- As stressful as it may be to clear up space to download that software update, you absolutely should. Besides fixing any bugs on your iPhone, software updates also bring with them security patches to reduce the chances of your phone getting hacked.\nLatest information on iPhones in 2025\nWhat are the tariffs in the US?\nThe recent US tariffs on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and India aim to boost domestic manufacturing but are likely to drive up prices on consumer electronics. Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production.\nSmartphones are among the most affected by the new US tariffs, with devices imported from China and Vietnam facing steep duties that could raise retail prices by 20% or more. Brands like Apple and Google, which rely heavily on Asian manufacturing, may either pass these costs on to consumers or absorb them at the expense of profit margins.\nThe tariffs could also lead to delays in product launches or shifts in where and how phones are made, forcing companies to diversify production to countries with more favorable trade conditions.\nIs the $2,300 iPhone pricing legit?\nSome analysts have warned that companies such as Apple might pass these tariff costs onto buyers, potentially leading to significantly higher prices, with one estimate suggesting the iPhone 16 Pro Max could reach $2,300.\nAlso: Worried about a $2,300 iPhone? How US tariffs are causing tech buyers to scramble\nIn response, companies like Apple are reportedly exploring alternatives, such as increasing iPhone imports from India. Therefore, it's reasonable for consumers considering new tech purchases to potentially buy sooner to avoid these price hikes or to consider refurbished devices as a cost-saving measure.\niPhone FAQs\nWill my iPhone support iOS 26?\nThe next version of iPhone software is iOS 26, and it will be supported by the most recent models, including the iPhone 16 series, iPhone 15 series, and iPhone 14 series. Apple has confirmed that the now seven-year-old iPhone XS and XR models will not be eligible to be updated to iOS 26, as the company typically cuts off support after that time span.\nWhat is the new iPhone?\nThe newest iPhone is the iPhone 16e, which starts at $599, making it the company's most affordable handset in its storefront. For the price, you get a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display, Apple Intelligence support, an A18 chip, a single 48MP main camera on the rear, and a USB-C port for data transfer and charging.\nShould I buy the iPhone 16 or wait for the iPhone 17?\nYou should buy the iPhone 17 if...\n- You want the best camera system on an iPhone\n- You can wait until September to learn more about what's new\n- You're interested in an ultra-slim iPhone that's lighter than normal handsets\nYou should buy the iPhone 16 if...\n- You require a new phone immediately; perhaps your existing handset broke or is unusable\n- There's a great deal on the older handset at your carrier or local retailer\nWhich iPhone is better, 15 or 16?\nBetween the two latest generations of iPhones, here are the key reasons to buy one over the other:\nYou should buy the iPhone 16 if...\n- You want an iPhone that will last you for more than a day; the iPhone 16 Pro Max is great for this\n- You want access to the latest Apple Intelligence (AI) features and don't have a 15 Pro model\nYou should buy the iPhone 15 if...\n- You can find a good deal on a used, second-hand model\nLightning port vs. USB-C\nOne of the biggest upgrades when Apple launched the iPhone 15 series was the USB-C port, a faster, more powerful, and more universal charging standard than the Lightning port on previous models. There's really no argument for the Lightning port unless you still own legacy Apple accessories, like the AirPods, and would much rather stick with the one charging standard.\nAlso: Best USB-C chargers and accessories: Expert tested\nOtherwise, even if you own an iPad or MacBook, or almost any other non-Apple gadget, USB-C is more widely used and truly the one-size-fits-all option for charging and transferring data.\nWhich iPhone models support Apple's new AI features?\nApple's existing (and upcoming) AI features, branded as \"Apple Intelligence,\" are available on iPhones with at least an A17 Pro processor. That means the iPhone 16 series and 15 Pro series will support the AI tools.\nWhat storage size should I buy for my iPhone?\nIt wasn't until 2021 that Apple began selling both its non-Pro and Pro iPhones with a base storage of 128GB. The only exception here is the iPhone SE model. While not as flashy of an upgrade as larger camera sensors and 120Hz displays, this double-up of storage meant that consumers had more space than ever to store apps, photos, videos, and more.\nMaurice Klaehne, senior market research analyst at Counterpoint Research, suggests that higher storage options are generally better as they will help with the longevity of the device, and his firm has generally seen an uptick in postpaid customers opting for higher storage sizes when they can afford them. \"Currently, the 256GB option is sufficient for most people,\" Klaehne adds.\nShould I trade in my old iPhone?\nTrading in an old iPhone is one of the easiest (and safest) ways to replace an otherwise unwanted device with a new, more capable one. Most retailers, including Apple, accept trade-ins of older iPhone models, with store credit ranging from as low as $50 to $800; it all depends on which generation your iPhone is, the condition, and whether it turns on or not.\nIs the iPhone 17 out yet?\nThe iPhone 17 series is expected to launch in September 2025, with there being potentially four new models: the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. The Air model is only rumored, but features a thinner design for better portability.\nDo I really need an iPhone case?\nWhile an iPhone case is not a necessity -- your iPhone will still function normally without it -- having one on greatly reduces the chances of wear and tear. For example, the best cases are military-grade certified, meaning they'll keep your iPhone protected from waist-high drops. Not only do cases reduce the chances of your phone getting cracked or scratched, but the plastic/rubberized material often provides more grip than if you hold your iPhone naked.\nWhich iPhone should I buy for a parent?\nAt the time of writing, the iPhone 16 is the best phone to buy for a parent. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles as its Pro siblings, but the iPhone 16 model has all the essential features in 2025, from eSIM support to a reliable battery and charging experience to a display large enough for any form of content consumption. It also comes in a Plus size if you require a bigger screen size.\nFrom our testing, the cameras on the iPhone 16 are reliable enough for clear video calls, the occasional outdoor photo, and capturing images of children and pets.\nWhat is eSIM?\nEmbedded Subscriber Identity Module, or eSIM in short, is the electronic version of the classic SIM card. That means your eSIM carries your phone number, mobile data plan, and telephone carrier info, just like a regular SIM card. The major difference between eSIM and SIM is that the former does not need to be physically installed onto your phone, which is why the iPhone 14, 15, and 16 lines no longer have a dedicated slot for it. Instead, you'll have to transfer the information wirelessly via Apple's file transfer service, or with the help of your local carrier representatives.\nAlso: eSIM vs. SIM: What's the difference?\nThere is one problem that ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner sees with Apple forcing eSIM adoption on US consumers. \"There are a variety of good reasons why some people will still need or prefer a phone with a physical SIM card. The top reason is privacy. This is especially true for some journalists and populations at risk of persecution around the world. Removing the physical SIM card option reduces privacy for millions of people, especially some of the most vulnerable,\" said Hiner.\nNote that if you buy an iPhone 14, 15, or 16 anywhere outside of the U.S., the device will come with a regular SIM card slot.\nWhich iPhone models support 5G?\nAll models within the iPhone 16, 15, 14, and 13 line, as well as select iPhone 12 models, support 5G wireless technology. Even the new iPhone 16e supports Sub-6, low-band 5G networks.\n5G continues to roll out across the US, and while it is debatable if there are benefits to the speeds of the network, in my experience, the broad coverage of low-band 5G has solved my connectivity issues in spotty coverage areas with past iPhone models.\nEven more importantly, the 5G iPhone models have Qualcomm chipsets inside that are proving to provide better RF reception than we saw in past iPhones that had Intel chipsets.\nWhich iPhone models support wireless charging or MagSafe?\nAll of the iPhone models in this list support Qi wireless charging technology, which is becoming an expected feature for modern smartphones from all manufacturers.\nMeanwhile, Apple's proprietary MagSafe technology is only supported by the iPhone 16, iPhone 15, iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and iPhone 12 models. (Notably, the latest iPhone 16e does not support MagSafe.)\nAlso: Best MagSafe accessories for your iPhone\nMagSafe provides a secure magnetic connection system so that you can connect to wireless chargers with perfect positioning and alignment. MagSafe can also be used with other accessories, such as wallets and kickstands.\nWhile the extra security when your iPhone is docked to a wireless charger can be a nice bonus, it's not vital and probably shouldn't be a major determiner in your choice. Apple's first-party wallets and battery packs that use MagSafe have also received somewhat mixed reviews, making them a hard sell for all except the most die-hard Apple enthusiasts.\nHow many years do iPhones typically last?\nWhile this number varies greatly depending on how you handle a smartphone -- perhaps you're a construction worker whose phone will be put through the harshest climates or you have kids who may drop the phone ever so often -- the iPhone will typically run efficiently for three to four years.\nThen, you'll likely experience more frequent app crashes, lag, storage problems, and more. Those are common issues that any piece of technology will inhibit, not just the iPhone, after years of constant usage.\nIf you'd like to prolong that time, I'd recommend visiting your local Apple store to have the phone's battery replaced every three to four years and also consider backing up files to an external hard drive for safekeeping. As a last resort, a factory reset, followed by data restoration, should give your phone a brand-new feel.\nLatest updates\n- In our July update, we added information regarding the public beta release of iOS 26 and recent news reports surrounding the upcoming iPhone 17 series. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 has also been added as an alternative pick.\n- In our June update, we updated the software advice sections to include iOS 26, which is being released to select iPhone models.\n- In our latest April update, we tested the iPhone 16e and added it as our recommendation for best cheap iPhone, replacing the iPhone SE (2022).\n- In our January update, we added the latest information on the iPhone 16 lineup and Apple Intelligence based on four months of extensive testing.\n- In our September update, we added the iPhone 16 lineup, including the standard models, Pro, and Pro Max. They replaced the iPhone 15 generation of handsets.\nOther phone models we tested\nOutside of this list of excellent options, here are worthy alternatives that will surely delight you.\nFor an older iPhone with 90% of the 16 Pro Max's features, consider the 15 Pro Max from 2023. You can still snag one at most retailers - and for less than the newest model.\nBy opting for the iPhone 15 Pro Max instead of the 16 series, you have more to gain than to lose. For example, the device has a similar-sized OLED display that gets plenty bright when outdoors. There's also a triple camera system that, from our long-term testing. competes well with the 16 Pro Max.\nReview: iPhone 15 Pro\nPerhaps most importantly, the iPhone 15 Pro series -- whether you opt for the Max variant or not -- supports the latest iOS 26 update and Apple Intelligence features.\nIf you're budget-shopping, the Google Pixel 9a is within the $500 price range and is one of the best midrange phones on the market. Having tested it and the iPhone 16e, I'd even go as far as to say that it's the better-value handset, and one that I recommend with confidence to both iOS and Android users.\nReview: Google Pixel 9a\nWhat makes the Pixel 9a stand out? It's fairly comfortable to use, with a 6.1-inch screen that's not too big and not too small, the battery size is actually the largest of any Google Pixel model at 5,100mAh, and the software experience is among the smoothest and most user-friendly in the Android space.\nSure, the device won't feel like a million dollars. But it's the well-roundedness of the Pixel 9a that makes it such a great buy, especially in today's economic landscape.\nIt's been long rumored that Apple will launch a foldable iPhone, and the latest reports point to an end-of-2026 release date. If you can't wait to experience a modern handset that flips and folds, consider the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7. It's such a polished foldable phone that you might even consider sticking with Samsung and Android in the long term.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7\nAt $1,099, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 features an expansive 4.1-inch external display that's great for one-handed browsing and app usage, as well as a 6.9-inch internal display when unfolded. Notably, both screens refresh at 120Hz, so they feel as smooth to interact with as they are to look at.\nThe big upgrade with this year's foldable model is its thinner yet more durable form factor, making the Galaxy Z Flip 7 more portable than ever. You really have to hold it to understand its beauty, so I highly recommend visiting your local carrier or retailer if you're even slightly interested.\nFor more on getting the most out of your iPhone, check out how to clear your iPhone cache, how to download the iOS 26 public beta, and how to block cookie pop-ups online."

A telltale sign that a product is good is when reporters and attendees rave about it and even use their money to buy it. And no matter where I went, I couldn't escape the glowing Meta Ray-Ban reviews.\nAlso: Meta's new $399 Oakley smart glasses beat the Ray-Bans in almost every way\nThese experiences weren't just ones that I noticed; sales told the same story. EssilorLuxottica, the glasses producer, reported in February that two million pairs of the Meta Ray-Bans have been sold since their October 2023 launch. After hearing so many positive reviews of the Meta Ray-Bans, I got a pair of my own.\nAs an eyeglass wearer and an openly photo-obsessed Gen-Zer, these smartglasses seemed like a perfect fit. After wearing them for six months, including at events such as CES, I have some favorite features. Surprisingly, my top picks are not what I initially thought they would be.\n1. The audio\nWhen considering whether I wanted the glasses, all the apparent benefits involved the dual cameras. I never expected my favorite feature to be the audio. The smartglasses are equipped with five microphones and two custom-built open-ear speakers that are surprisingly performant.\nI often forget that I am wearing smart glasses until I start scrolling on social media and hear audio. The audio is as good as using any earbuds with ambient mode or open-ear headphones, such as the Shockz OpenFit. There is sound leakage, but as someone who frequently uses open-ear headphones, I don't have any shame.\nAlso: I tested Meta's transparent Ray-Ban smart glasses, and they're a near-perfect accessory for me\nAnother major advantage is how good the microphones are. My biggest form of communication is audio message exchanges, and I was nervous that the glasses would make it inconvenient or difficult to send them. Instead, the glasses pick up my voice naturally, with no issues. In fact, they're better than some earbuds that I have tested and worn.\n2. AI-enabled translation\nAs an artificial intelligence (AI) reporter, I have tested several AI translation devices, and my email inbox is flooded with pitches from companies promoting them. These products are typically costly and only fulfill one task. For that reason, I was excited to see that the Meta Ray-Bans include an AI-powered live translation feature for free.\nAlso: Your Meta Ray-Bans just got a major feature upgrade for free - and it feels surreal\nAlthough AI translation is not something you might reach for every day, in situations where you need help, it's nice to know that you have an assistant close at hand. Plus, as someone who grew up in a Spanish-speaking household and is fluent, I tried the tech with my mom in real time, and was impressed at how accurately it translated, how quick it was to get started, and how easy it was to set up.\n3. Easy access to Meta AI (bonus, it's multimodal)\nNow, I know most days you may not use an AI voice assistant on your phone, but what makes the tech great on these smartglasses is accessibility.\nThe best part about Meta Ray-Bans is that you often forget you are wearing them. So, you can go about your day, washing dishes, folding clothes, sweeping the floor, and commuting without your phone while still having access to important features, such as push notifications, music, and assistance.\nAlso: The best AI chatbots of 2025: ChatGPT, Copilot, and notable alternatives\nFor example, if you are grilling outside and your phone is in the house, you can quickly ask, \"How long should I cook a burger on the grill before flipping?\" and it will tell you. But to take it a step forward, you can leverage the glasses' AI-enabled multimodal assistance, which uses the feed from the cameras at the top of the lenses as context.\nIn that scenario, you could say something like, \"How long before I flip this?\" The assistant would use the visual context to provide an answer. Because of the position of the cameras, the glasses can see what you see, which can be even more helpful. Whenever I call on this feature, it never gets old.\n4. Filming\nThis may seem like an obvious perk, but if you create lots of visual content, the Meta Ray-Bans are a cool tool to add to your arsenal. Because of the positioning of the cameras in the glasses, the footage you get is unique, as it is literally from your point of view.\nFor example, if you are on an amusement park ride, walking through a venue, or cooking a meal, people see exactly what you are experiencing. This point-of-view experience is similar to that of a GoPro device, and despite the inferior quality, if you are like me and not an adrenaline junky, this option may be more practical.\nAlso: Apple's Meta Ray-Bans killer is only one of four major launches in 2027 - here's the list\nAnother benefit is the button's positioning. It is prominently and conveniently displayed at the top of the right eye, so there is no messing around when you see something you want to shoot. This capability makes it even quicker than taking your phone out and clicking the record button.\n5. Form factor\nLast but not least, I wouldn't be able to talk about the Meta Ray-Bans without talking about the form factor. In the photo above, I have them side-by-side next to the pair I wear every day, and you can see that they look extremely similar, despite packing many components such as cameras, microphones, speakers, and a battery. Most people can't even tell that the Ray-Bans are smart glasses, unless you are a fellow techie.\nOne pain point\nThe battery dies too fast for my liking. In my experience, I typically can make them last around six hours. However, that often means the power on the glasses lasts halfway through my day, which isn't ideal. That's why the newly announced Oakley Meta glasses are so appealing; they're rated to last upwards of eight hours.\nThere is also no way to charge the Ray-Ban glasses while they are on your face, though I'm sure an additional component for that would only add to their existing heft. My workaround is to wear the Meta Ray-Bans when I know I need to use the features, rather than every day.\nLuckily, if you have been wanting to get a pair and the battery life of the smartglasses was also your biggest deterrent, Meta launched new Oakley smart glasses that can be used for eight hours instead of four, doubling the battery lifetime. It also comes with upgrades in virtually every other aspect, including higher-quality video recording and an IPX4 water resistance rating.\nThe limited-edition Oakley Meta HSTN glasses retail for $499 and are available for pre-order now. But more models will be available later this summer at the lower price point of $399.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter.\nThis story was originally published on May 12, 2025, and was updated on July 14, 2025."
