Kingsbury stepped down from the job on January 15.\nThe 27 locations spread across 15 states that are shuttering represent a small fraction of the overall 1,150-plus store fleet the company says is healthy, strong, and profitable. The closures are expected to be completed by April.\n\"As we continue to build on our long-term growth strategy, it is important that we also take difficult but necessary actions to support the health and future of our business for our customers and our teams,\" Kingsbury said in a statement last week.\nIn addition to the closing stores, the company said it will shutter an e-commerce fulfillment center in San Bernardino, California, as newer centers and fulfill-from-store capabilities have made the 15-year-old facility unnecessary.\nKohl's said employees at affected locations have the option of applying to another open role or taking a \"competitive\" severance package.\nHere is the list of closing Kohl's locations\nAlabama\n- Spanish Fort\n21000 Town Center Ave.\nArkansas\n- Little Rock West\n13909 Chenal Pkwy.\nCalifornia\n- Balboa (San Diego)\n5505 Balboa Ave. - Encinitas\n134 N El Camino Real - Fremont\n43782 Christy St. - Mountain View\n350 Showers Dr. - Napa\n1116 1st St. - Pleasanton\n4525 Rosewood Dr. - Point West (Sacramento)\n1896 Arden Way - San Rafael\n5010 Northgate Dr. - San Luis Obispo\n205 Madonna Rd. - Westchester\n8739 S Sepulveda Blvd.\nColorado\n- Arapahoe Crossing (Aurora)\n6584 S Parker Rd.\nGeorgia\n- Duluth\n2050 W Liddell Rd.\nIdaho\n- Boise\n400 N Milwaukee St.\nIllinois\n- Plainfield\n11860 S Route 59 - Spring Hill (West Dundee)\n3000 Spring Hill Ring Rd.\nMassachusetts\n- Stoughton\n501 Technology Center Dr.\nNew Jersey\n- East Windsor\n72 Princeton Hightstown Rd.\nOhio\n- Blue Ash\n4150 Hunt Rd. - Forest Park (Cincinnati)\n100 Cincinnati Mills Dr.\nOregon\n- Portland Gateway\n10010 NE Halsey St.\nPennsylvania\n- Pottstown\n351 W Schuylkill Rd.\nTexas\n- North Dallas\n18224 Preston Rd.\nUtah\n- Riverton\n13319 S 3600 W Ste 13LOT\nVirginia\n- Herndon\n2100 Centreville Rd. - Williamsburg\n100 Gristmill Plz"

A smaller number of people in publicity, casting, and development are being laid off as well. Some people in corporate finance, who are spread globally, were also affected. No teams were eliminated.\nDisney has made several head count reductions in recent years as the TV audiences migrate to streaming platforms, where profits have been slow to follow.\nIn March, the company cut nearly 6%, or about 200 people, in its ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks.\nLast fall, the company let go of around 300 people in corporate departments following a layoff of around 140 people, including at National Geographic and Freeform.\nBob Iger laid the groundwork for broad cuts when he returned in late 2022 for his second time as CEO, saying in 2023 that he would cut 7,000 jobs.\nDisney has turned a corner in streaming, making that business profitable for the first time last year. It's also looking for growth in its parks and experiences business, recently announcing it would partner to build a theme park in Abu Dhabi."

He didn't expand on what products would be affected or by how much.\nPrice checks suggest the cost of some Nike products has already increased this year. In May, BMO Capital analysts said they observed price increases of $5 to $10 on the Nike website.\nDuring Thursday's earnings call, Friend outlined a four-part strategy \u2014 including the price increases \u2014 to mitigate the $1 billion tariff costs, beginning with diversifying its sourcing and allocating production across countries.\nNike said 16% of the footwear it imports to the US comes from China. It expects that share to drop to the high single digits by the end of fiscal year 2026.\nIt also plans to work with suppliers and retail partners to minimize the impact of tariffs on consumers. Friend told investors that these arrangements will go into effect throughout fiscal 2026.\nHe also said the company would \"evaluate corporate cost reduction.\"\nNike's revenue for its 2025 fiscal year fell 10% year over year to about $46 million, the company reported Thursday. However, it beat Wall Street's modest expectations for quarterly sales and profit and said it expects the declines to moderate looking ahead. It expects the tariff impact to be greatest in the first half of its 2026 fiscal year.\nCEO Elliott Hill took the helm of Nike about eight months ago. He's been trying to get the company back on track by slashing promotional sales, improving its wholesale relationships with major retailers, and putting sports at the forefront of its strategy."

But with historically low attrition and continued market shifts, this is a necessary step to better align our firm for the future,\" Byrne told assurance staff in the internal email, which BI has reviewed.\nAn employee in the firm's assurance division described the layoffs as \"unnerving.\" They said jobs in audit and tax had a reputation for being more stable compared with consulting divisions at the Big Four.\n\"I wouldn't say this aligns with my expectation of a leading professional services firm,\" the employee told BI.\nThe employee added that they were not surprised by the layoffs, given that in a meeting with their regional sector leader on April 2, there was \"discussion of increased pressure on the firm's bottom line as opposed to last year.\"\nA person familiar with the matter told BI that the layoffs also affect some workers from PwC's products and technology division as part of a longer-term unraveling of that department.\nThe person said some division employees had been transferred to other lines of service and the remaining employees had been let go.\nPwC US is also slowing hiring and internship offers, and the Big Four firm plans to be more selective about appointments, the person said, adding that all existing offers were being honored.\nIn its latest financial year, annual growth at PwC's Americas division slowed from 10.7% in 2023 to 3.4% in 2024.\nIts fellow Big Four firms EY and Deloitte have also carried out layoffs and slowed partner appointments in the past year amid a wider consulting industry slowdown.\nHave a tip?

While no one died in the incident, several passengers were injured, and the pilots were forced to make an emergency landing in Portland, Oregon.\nIn the aftermath of the incident, the FAA temporarily grounded over 170 of Boeing's 737 Max 9 planes until they could complete safety inspections.\nThe Justice Department opened an investigation into Boeing shortly after, and the FBI told passengers aboard the flight that they might have been victims of a crime.\nOngoing litigation\nBoeing was hit with multiple lawsuits this year.\nPassengers from the Alaska Airlines flight filed a class action suit against the company just days after the incident.\n\"Passengers were shocked and confused, thrust into a waking nightmare unsure if these were their last seconds alive,\" the lawsuit said.\nBoeing's shareholders filed a separate class action suit against the company in January, stating that it had prioritized profit over safety, Reuters reported.\nSeparately, in July, Boeing struck a plea deal related to two 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. If a judge had approved the deal, it would have allowed Boeing to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud, avoid a trial, pay a fine of about $244 million, and invest at least $455 million in safety and compliance measures.\nBoeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion in 2021 in a deal with the federal government to avoid prosecution for the crashes, but Justice Department officials said in May that Boeing had violated portions of the deal, putting a trial back on the table. Relatives of the deceased passengers asked a Texas judge in October to throw out the agreement, which they called a \"sweetheart\" deal. The families have previously called for the company to pay a fine amounting to nearly $25 billion.\nIn December, the judge rejected the deal. A lawyer representing families who lost people in the 2019 crash told BI that they \"anticipate a significant renegotiation of the plea deal that incorporates terms truly commensurate with the gravity of Boeing's crimes.\"\nFAA audit of Boeing's safety procedures\nThe Federal Aviation Administration commissioned a report into Boeing following the fatal 2018 and 2019 crashes \u2014 and the results published in February weren't good news for the company.\nThe FAA report found 27 insufficient areas in Boeing's safety procedures, including no clear system for employees to report safety concerns, confusing management structures, and poor communication with employees about safety procedures.\nThe latest statement from the FAA about Boeing's compliance to remedy the safety issues was published in August. It said the agency continues \"actively monitoring Boeing's progress in a variety of ways,\" including regular reviews by FAA experts of Boeing's safety procedures and issuing airworthiness certificates for every newly produced Boeing 737 Max.\nThe FAA itself has faced scrutiny for its oversight of Boeing. A report from the Department of Transportation's Office of the Inspector General in October found the agency's checks were insufficient.\nExodus of Boeing executives\nIn March, Boeing announced a leadership shake-up.\nCEO Dan Calhoun said he would step down. Stan Deal, the CEO of the company's commercial airplanes division, said he would retire. In the same announcement, board chair Larry Kellner announced his plan not to seek reelection.\nStephanie Pope, the company's COO, was promoted to replace Deal shortly after his departure. At the end of July, Kelly Ortberg was named the company's new CEO.\nTed Colbert, who headed Boeing's defense, space, and security division, became the first prominent executive to leave the company after Ortberg took over. Colbert's departure was announced in September.\nStranded astronauts\nThe aerospace company faced another high-profile problem in June when NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams traveled to the International Space Station on Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spaceship. It marked the first time Boeing flew astronauts to space.\nThe astronauts left Earth on June 5 and were supposed to return after eight days, but issues with Starliner's thrusters and helium leaks caused delays. NASA and Boeing began troubleshooting the problems to bring Wilmore and Williams back home. However, in late July, the two astronauts were still stuck at the International Space Station.\nNASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, Steve Stich, said in a press briefing that month that Elon Musk's SpaceX could bring home the astronauts if needed. After working with Boeing to determine whether the two astronauts could safely return to Earth on Starliner, NASA announced in August that it chose SpaceX to do the job instead.\n\"Spaceflight is risky,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said during a press conference. \"Even at its safest. Even at its most routine. A test flight, by nature, is neither safe nor routine. So, the decision to keep Butch and Suni aboard the International Space Station, and bring the Boeing Starliner home un-crewed, is a result of a commitment to safety.\"\nThe decision was a major blow to Boeing, which spent $4.2 billion developing Starliner. Wilmore and Williams' flight was the final step Boeing needed to clear for NASA to certify Starliner for human spaceflight. It highlighted just how far Boeing lags behind its competitor, SpaceX.\nWilmore and Williams are now expected to return to Earth in 2025 on SpaceX's Crew Dragon spaceship, which launched for the International Space Station in September. The astronauts were initially set to return home in February, but NASA announced they would be delayed until March as SpaceX readies its spaceship.\nUnion strike\nThousands of unionized Boeing employees walked out in September after contract negotiations broke down.\nThe strike began despite a promising pay package proposal, which would have raised wages by more than 25% over the contract period for more than 32,000 employees in the Pacific Northwest.\nUltimately, union workers denied the proposal and voted to initiate a strike, which is costing the company about $50 million a day.\nNegotiations stalled, with both sides filing National Labor Relations Board violations accusing the other of negotiating in bad faith.\nBoeing and union leaders reached a tentative deal on October 19 that included a 35% general wage increase spread over four years and a one-time ratification bonus of $7,000.\nHowever, striking Boeing employees rejected the deal on October 24.\n\"After 10 years of sacrifice, we still have ground to make up. We hope to resume negotiations promptly,\" the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said on X.\nThe 53-day strike ended in early November when workers approved a new contract.\nLayoffs\nBoeing began furloughs of white-collar workers in mid-September after the strike began. Select employees were required to take one week off every four weeks on a rolling basis.\nOrtberg, in a staff memo, also announced that executive leadership would take a \"commensurate pay reduction for the duration of the strike,\" though details of the pay reduction remain unclear.\nLayoffs began several weeks later. In mid-October, Boeing announced plans to lay off about 10% of its 170,000-member workforce.\nIn a memo to employees, Ortberg said Boeing was in a \"difficult position\" and that \"restoring our company requires tough decisions.\"\nThe company also delayed production of its 777X twin-engine jet and discontinued production of its 767 cargo plane, the memo noted.\nProduction delays with the Boeing 777X plane\nThe experimental 777X is Boeing's newest widebody plane, banking 481 orders from more than a dozen global carriers even though regulators have not yet approved it to fly passengers.\nBut the aircraft has been riddled with production problems \u2014 like supply chain issues, design troubles, and now the ongoing strike \u2014 which have already put it five years behind schedule and set Boeing back $1.5 billion.\nThat hole will likely deepen with the latest entry delay to 2026, further eroding the industry's trust in Boeing's 777X program. It could also push carriers to choose Boeing's European rival Airbus and its already-in-service Airbus A350.\nThe aircraft is still uncertified but started certification flight testing in July. Testing was halted in August due to a problem with a key part that connects the engine to the aircraft, CNBC reported.\nProduction troubles with Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft\nThe FAA announced in January that it would not grant any production expansions of Boeing's MAX aircraft, including the 737 MAX 9, following the emergency on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282.\n\"The Jan. 5 Boeing 737-9 MAX incident must never happen again,\" the FAA said in a press release said.\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said Boeing would not be cleared to expand production or add additional production lines for the 737 MAX \"until we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved,\" according to the press release.\nBoeing held a three-hour meeting with the FAA in June to address safety and quality concerns. Afterward, Whitaker spoke at a press conference, where he told a reporter that expanding production of 737 MAX planes was still up in the air.\nThe FAA told Business Insider, \"This is about systemic change, and there's a lot of work to be done. Boeing must meet milestones, and the timing of our decisions will be driven by their ability to do so.\"\nThe agency added: \"Boeing has delivered a roadmap to change its safety culture, and the FAA will make sure Boeing implements the changes they have outlined. We will not approve production increases beyond the current cap until we're satisfied they've followed through on implementing corrective actions and transforming their safety culture.\"\nBoeing restarted production of the 737 Max in December following the strike's conclusion.\nWhistleblowers report problems at Boeing\nSam Salehpour, a Boeing engineer, testified at an April Senate hearing that the company ignored his reports on safety concerns, that his boss retaliated against him, and that he received threats against his physical safety.\nThe Senate subcommittee investigating Boeing's safety and quality practices released a 204-page report in June. The report included accounts from several whistleblowers.\nSam Mohawk, a Boeing quality assurance inspector, said the company lost track of hundreds of bad 737 parts and instructed employees to conceal improperly stored plane parts from FAA inspectors.\nAnother whistleblower, Richard Cuevas, wrote in a June complaint to the FAA that holes were being incorrectly drilled on Boeing's 787 Dreamliner planes.\nMoney woes\nIn a sign of how Boeing's problems have hurt its bottom line, the company said in a regulatory filing to the SEC in October that it had entered a $10 billion credit agreement with four major banks: JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Citibank.\nThe company also filed a prospectus saying it might sell up to $25 billion in securities.\n\"These are two prudent steps to support the company's access to liquidity,\" Boeing said in a statement.\nWhile workers were on strike, Bank of America analysts estimated that the work stoppage cost Boeing $50 million a day.\nTo save money, Ortberg, the company's CEO, instructed top executives to stop flying private jets and instead fly economy on commercial flights.\nStock drops after 737 crash in South Korea\nA Boeing 737-800 operated by South Korean low-cost carrier Jeju Air crashed on Sunday, killing 179 of its 181 occupants.\nThe cause of the crash is still unknown, though officials are suggesting a bird strike as a possible factor. Boeing is unlikely to be at fault for the 15-year-old jet's fatal crash landing.\nStill, Boeing shares fell as much as 5% in trading on Monday following the crash."

      "text": "- Jeff Bezos' space company, Blue Origin, has launched its first orbital rocket, New Glenn.\n- New Glenn is one of the largest, most powerful rockets ever built.\n- The maiden launch marks a milestone for Blue Origin.\nJeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin has entered the rocket big leagues.\nAt 2:03 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, Blue Origin's 32-story-tall New Glenn rocket fired its seven engines and climbed atop a cloud of fire and steam for the first time, roaring into the skies above the launch complex in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\"LIFTOFF! New Glenn is beginning its first ever ascent toward the stars,\" Blue Origin wrote in an X post on Thursday morning.\nBezos, who was present at New Glenn's launch, uploaded a minute-long clip of the launch on X shortly after liftoff.\n\u2014 Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) January 16, 2025\nNew Glenn belongs to a new generation of the largest, most powerful rockets ever built, next to Elon Musk's SpaceX's Starship and NASA's new moon rocket, the Space Launch System.\nThese heavy-lift vehicles have roughly the size and heft of NASA's Saturn V \u2014 the rocket that launched Apollo astronauts to the moon \u2014 but they're designed for even more ambitious goals.\nMusk and Bezos have espoused plans to establish permanent human settlements on Mars and on a giant space station, respectively. NASA aims to build permanent science stations on and around the moon and eventually send astronauts to Mars with SpaceX's and Blue Origins' help.\nFirst, though, Blue Origin needs to strengthen its business. New Glenn's maiden launch positions the company to fly payloads to orbit and challenge SpaceX's dominance.\nBlue Origin was originally planning to launch New Glenn on Monday. The launch was repeatedly delayed and eventually postponed after Blue Origin said they had to \"troubleshoot a vehicle subsystem issue.\"\nWe\u2019re moving our NG-1 launch to no earlier than Thursday, January 16. The three-hour launch window opens at 1 a.m. EST (0600 UTC).\n\u2014 Blue Origin (@blueorigin) January 14, 2025\n\"I'm incredibly proud New Glenn achieved orbit on its first attempt,\" Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp on Thursday. \"We knew landing our booster, So You're Telling Me There's a Chance, on the first try was an ambitious goal. We'll learn a lot from today and try again at our next launch this spring. Thank you to all of Team Blue for this incredible milestone.\"\nBlue Origin loses booster in an otherwise successful launch\nIn a statement two hours after the launch, Blue Origin confirmed that it had lost its booster after it separated from the rocket\nThe booster was meant to return to Earth and land on a platform in the ocean, which would have been the company's first step to proving the reusability of its booster.\nThis makes SpaceX the only company to have recovered and reused a rocket's booster. The Musk-led rocket company has been retrieving its much smaller Falcon 9 first-stage boosters for reuse in this way for years.\nSpaceX's Starship booster recently proved a different landing method, lowering itself into the waiting arms of a landing tower in October.\nLike Falcon 9, and unlike Starship, New Glenn is only partially reusable \u2014 its second stage is not designed for reuse.\nMusk congratulated Bezos shortly after New Glenn's successful liftoff.\n\"Congratulations on reaching orbit on the first attempt! @JeffBezos,\" Musk wrote on X.\nBlue Origin's future depends on New Glenn\nTrailing behind SpaceX, Blue Origin is one of the leading companies paving the way for reusable rockets, which can help slash spaceflight costs.\nWeeks before New Glenn's debut launch, during the New York Times 2024 DealBook Summit, Bezos said Blue Origin \"is not a very good business, yet.\"\nHe added, \"It's going to be the best business that I've ever been involved in.\"\nNew Glenn is Blue Origin's second rocket, but its first designed to insert itself into Earth's orbit.\nThe company began construction on New Glenn in 2016. Bezos has said he isn't happy with the company's speed of progress.\n\"Blue Origin needs to be much faster,\" Bezos told Lex Fridman in December 2023. \"And it's one of the reasons that I left my role as the CEO of Amazon a couple of years ago.\"\nFor comparison, SpaceX began developing its first orbital rocket, the Falcon 9 v1.0, in 2005. It made its debut launch five years later, in 2010.\nThat said, New Glenn is more than three times more powerful than SpaceX's first Falcon 9.\nBlue Origin's comparatively tiny New Shepard rocket, which carries paying customers and other payloads to suborbital space, has been reused nearly 30 times since its first launch in 2015.\nNew Glenn's maiden voyage is carrying a test payload\nAs Blue Origin's barge sails the booster back to the coast, the rocket's second stage is scheduled to remain in space for about six hours while carrying the company's prototype Blue Ring pathfinder spacecraft.\nBlue Ring is designed for multiple mission types, including transporting, refueling, and communicating with other craft in space. The pathfinder prototype launched on Thursday is a test launch and is set to remain onboard and not be deployed into space.\n\"There is a growing demand to quickly move and position equipment and infrastructure in multiple orbits,\" Limp wrote on X in December. Blue Ring is designed to fulfill that need for both government and commercial customers, the Blue Origin CEO said.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has granted Blue Origin a license to launch New Glenn to orbit from Cape Canaveral for the next five years.\nBlue Origin's customers include NASA, Amazon, and several telecommunications providers."

      "text": "- Disney CEO Bob Iger announced layoffs on Wednesday.\n- 7,000 jobs will be cut.\n- Iger returned as CEO in November.\nDisney CEO Bob Iger is looking to cut costs and reorganize the company, announcing sweeping layoffs on Wednesday.\nDuring the company's quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, Iger said the company would cut 7,000 jobs. It's part of an effort to target $5.5 billion in cost savings this year, Iger said.\nIger returned as CEO in November after leaving the role in early 2020. He replaced his successor, Bob Chapek.\nInsider reported on Tuesday that Disney insiders were already bracing for thousands of layoffs. In a November memo about a hiring freeze, prior to his firing, Chapek had warned staff that the company \"would look at every avenue of operations and labor to find savings, and we do anticipate some staff reductions as part of this review.\"\nInternally, there was speculation that staffers who work on non-premium digital products could be among those cut, a company insider said.\nIger also announced a reorganization of the company into three units:\n- Disney Entertainment \u2014 including streaming platforms and its film studios, as well as other segments \u2014 will be led by Alan Bergman, who oversaw Disney studios, and Dana Walden, who oversaw original content and news for Disney's streaming platforms and linear networks.\n- ESPN will be led by James Pitaro, formerly chair of ESPN and Sports Content, and president of ESPN before that.\n- Parks, Experiences, and Products will continue to be led by Josh D'Amaro.\nDisney reported in its earnings report that Disney+ lost subscribers for the first time \u2014 over 2 million, all from India's Disney+ HotStar. The platform now has 161.8 million subscribers, compared to 164.2 million the prior quarter.\nBut Iger still believes that streaming is the future, he said on the earnings call Wednesday. He said his plan to invest in the company's streaming future includes: focusing more on core brands and franchises, curating general-entertainment content, and balancing global and local content.\n\"Streaming will continue to grow, albeit at the expense of linear programming,\" Iger said."

Ex-employees also say they won't receive severance.\n- BI reported earlier this month that Microsoft was taking a stronger stance on performance management.\nMicrosoft has started performance-based job cuts, according to termination letters viewed by Business Insider.\nEmployees losing their jobs will see healthcare benefits end immediately, the letters say. In three specific cases, employees were told by Microsoft that they weren't getting severance, people familiar with the situation said. These people asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics.\n\"The reason(s) for the termination of your employment include your job performance has not met minimum performance standards and expectations for your position,\" the letters viewed by BI say. \"You are relieved of all job duties effective immediately and your access to Microsoft systems, accounts, and buildings will be removed effective today. You are not to perform any further work on behalf of Microsoft.\"\nThe letters don't mention severance but say medical, prescription, and dental benefits end on the last day of employment. The letters also say Microsoft will consider past performance and termination if the person applies for other jobs at the company in the future.\nAs BI reported earlier this month, Microsoft is taking a stronger stance on performance management like its competitors, and managers at the company have spent the past few months evaluating employees all the way up to level 80, one of its highest levels. A company spokesperson declined to comment on Thursday.\nA Microsoft spokesperson previously confirmed the job cuts, saying that when people leave for performance reasons, Microsoft often backfills the roles, so there might be little change to the company's overall head count. At the end of June, Microsoft had roughly 228,000 full-time employees.\n\"At Microsoft we focus on high performance talent,\" the spokesperson said. \"We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action.\"\nMicrosoft also started cutting jobs this month across organizations including security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming, according to two people familiar with the matter. At the time, a spokesperson said those layoffs were separate from the performance-based cuts.\nRead an excerpt from Microsoft's performance-based termination letters:\n\"The reason(s) for the termination of your employment include your job performance has not met minimum performance standards and expectations for your position. You are relieved of all job duties effective immediately and your access to Microsoft systems, accounts, and buildings will be removed effective today. You are not to perform any further work on behalf of Microsoft.\nNote: If you apply for employment at Microsoft in the future, your past performance and basis of termination will be considered.\nYou must immediately return your Microsoft cardkey, corporate American Express card, phone card, and any other Microsoft property, including but not limited to hardware, software, email files, source code, customer contact information, financial data, status reports, or any other proprietary or confidential data or trade secret information that you have in your possession to me.\nYou are bound by the terms of your Microsoft Employee Agreement to return such materials and to protect Microsoft confidential information after termination of your employment.

Bosworth also said that Horizon Worlds on mobile must succeed for the company's long-term metaverse ambitions to survive.\nIn January, Meta reorganized its Reality Labs division. Meta's COO, Javier Olivan, now leads the team previously run by former Reality Labs COO Dan Reed. Other leaders in Reality Labs also now report to top executives in Meta's main business, showing that the company is making this division a bigger focus.\nAlthough Meta is cutting staff, 495 roles remained open in Reality Labs, according to the company's careers site. A spokesperson told BI that affected employees are eligible for internal opportunities, and many have already been matched to open positions for interviews.\n\"If you choose not to look for another role at Meta or are unsuccessful in finding a new role, your termination date will be May 23, 2025,\" an internal email to one affected employee viewed by BI said.\nThe Verge earlier reported on these cuts.\nHave a tip?

      "text": "- Starbucks is mulling a change to how customers get coffee when they order through the chain's app.\n- Customers have been asking to choose a specific pickup time, CEO Brian Niccol said.\n- Mobile ordering is an area Niccol is looking at as Starbucks attempts a turnaround.\nStarbucks might soon ask you to choose a time to pick up your morning cup of coffee.\nCEO Brian Niccol told The Wall Street Journal that the chain was considering the change to its mobile ordering system to help customers and baristas.\nRight now, Starbucks' mobile app gives customers a pickup time \u2014 sometimes as little as a few minutes \u2014 when they place an order. Niccol said that often doesn't reflect when the customer can actually stop by to get their drink, especially if they aren't near a store when they order.\n\"When you mobile order, you'll get a message that says that the beverage will be ready in three minutes,\" he told the Journal. \"But you physically can't get there in three minutes.\"\nThat leads to a mismatch between \"when the customer wants it and when we should be making it,\" the CEO said.\nHe added that some Starbucks customers had been asking to choose when they retrieve their order. \"The number-one request is actually 'Let me pick what time I can come pick up my beverage,'\" he said.\nStarbucks' mobile ordering system has been a sore spot for customers and for the employees who make their drinks.\nSome store employees, whom Starbucks refers to as \"partners,\" told Business Insider last fall that their locations were often overwhelmed by the number of mobile orders. They said that led to long wait times for customers as the partners struggled to prepare drinks and catch up.\nWorkers told BI that promotions for members of Starbucks' rewards program, especially those offering customers a discount if they ordered several drinks at once, contributed to the problem. Under Niccol, Starbucks has reined in the number of promotions it offers to rewards members.\nNiccol became Starbucks' CEO in September. Since then, he has detailed a turnaround plan for the coffee chain aimed at reversing sales declines.\nNiccol said this month that Starbucks' mobile ordering system \"chipped away\" at the chain's \"soul.\" He argued that many baristas were too busy preparing drinks to chat with customers and provide other personalized services that Niccol wants the chain to be known for.\nNiccol told the Journal he wanted to improve Starbucks' mobile ordering system over the next year.\n\"At a minimum, we will be a lot better than where we are today,\" he said.\nDo you work at Starbucks and have a story idea to share?

Microsoft's spokesperson did not comment on or confirm these terms.\nAs Business Insider reported last month, these cuts are intended to reduce the number of middle managers and increase the ratio of coders versus noncoders on projects. Microsoft organizations want to increase their \"span of control,\" or the number of employees who report to each manager. A spokesperson said these latest cuts were not performance-driven.\nAcross the tech industry, a culling of middle managers is already underway. Amazon has been trying to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers. And in December, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told staff that the company cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency drive.\nMicrosoft is also trying to decrease the \"PM ratio\" on some teams, which is the ratio of product managers or program managers to engineers.\nHave a tip?

      "text": "- Nissan is cutting 9,000 jobs globally to reduce costs, the company said Thursday.\n- Sales fell to 1.6 million units due to higher costs, especially in the US.\n- Nissan will cut production capacity by 20% and executives will take pay cuts.\nNissan is cutting 9,000 jobs globally in an effort to cut costs, the Japanese automobile giant said in an earnings statement on Thursday.\nNissan said that sales volumes decreased year-on-year to 1.6 million cars, hurt by higher selling and production costs, particularly from the US. That translated to much lower revenue: Profit for the quarter that ended in September was 32 million yen, or $208 million, falling far short of the $1.4 billion Nissan reported during the same period last year.\nAlong with the layoffs, Nissan is cutting production capacity by 20%. CEO Makoto Uchida is also forfeiting 50% of his monthly compensation starting this month, among other executives who are taking a voluntary pay cut.\nThe company also installed Guillaume Cartier, currently the chair of Nissan's Africa, Middle East, India, Europe, and Oceania unit, in a new role: chief performance officer, in which he will oversee sales and profit.\nOver the summer, Nissan started a voluntary severance program. At the time, a spokesman told Automotive News that Nissan was not planning on layoffs.\nNissan had 133,580 employees as of March 31. It was not immediately clear how the job cuts would be distributed among the company's global workforce.\nThe company did not respond to a request for comment.\nNissan's stock is down 32% this year.\nThe company faces declining sales in China due to competition from local players and it has been slow to produce electric or hybrid vehicles, which have been in demand compared to gas-only models.\nSales in the US have also taken a hit despite spending on advertisements and promotions. In the first half of the year, average Nissan dealerships earned 70% less than they did during the same timeframe last year \u2014 the lowest level in nearly 15 years, per Automotive News. Sales of Nissan's EVs have also suffered because they do not qualify for the $7,500 US government tax credits for cars built in North America.\nBetween 2001 and 2017, Nissan was led by auto titan Carlos Ghosn, who was arrested in Japan on suspicion of financial misconduct during his time as CEO of the company.

      "text": "- Southwest Airlines is ditching its signature unassigned seating policy.\n- Southwest, the US's largest domestic carrier, celebrates its customer- and employee-focused mission.\n- The airline found success using unconventional marketing and operational strategies.\nSouthwest Airlines is the US's largest domestic carrier, serving over 100 destinations across the country.\nThe carrier has been in operation since 1971 and just celebrated its 53rd anniversary in June 2024.\nSource: Southwest\nOne of the hallmarks of the Southwest experience is that the airline does not assign seats, instead, each passenger is provided a boarding group number. Once on board the aircraft, they are allowed to sit in any open seat.\nIn September, that's all going to change as the airline rolls out new seating policies that may largely match competitors' paid seat assignments and premium options.\nOn Thursday, Southwest announced plans to scrap the unassigned seat policy and also sell premium seating options.\n\"The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest Customers, and 86% of potential Customers, prefer an assigned seat,\" the airline said in a press announcement.\nSource: Southwest is ditching its unassigned seat policy for the first time\nThe airline is under pressure to generate additional revenue after activist investor Elliott Investment Management revealed a $1.9 billion stake in June. The group is pushing for changes at the airline to increase profitability and share price.\nSouthwest started as a small carrier based in Texas and only operated intra-state routes between three cities: San Antonio, Houston, and Dallas.\nThe airline, which was originally called Air Southwest, was dreamt up by Rollin King and Herb Kelleher on a cocktail napkin in 1966.\nKing mapped the network he envisioned, making a triangle between the three key cities. He explained to Kelleher that operating solely in Texas would make the company exempt from the Civil Aeronautics Board's federal regulations, which controlled fares, routes, and schedules.\nSource: Southwest\nFrom 1938 to 1978, the airline industry was federally regulated under the CAB as means to ensure major carriers like United and Pan Am were profitable. Fares were sky-high and only business travelers and deep-pocket leisure customers could afford the luxury of flight. The downside was that a lot of the time, planes flew half-empty.\nBecause Air Southwest was certified under the state's aviation regulator, the Texas Aeronautics Commission, it was not bound to federal rules \u2014 a clever loophole King unapologetically copied from California carrier Pacific Southwest Airlines.\nSource: Southwest\nThe loophole allowed Air Southwest to fly freely in Texas and undercut competitors' fares, offering more customers the option to fly instead of drive in the large state. The business model was game-changing and a threat to legacy airlines.\nSource: Southwest\nIn 1967, three airlines operating under federal rules, Braniff, Trans-Texas Airways, and Continental Airlines, took legal action against Air Southwest, saying it does not have the right to fly in Texas.\nSource: Companies History\nThe lawsuit took three years to resolve, and in 1970, the Texas Supreme Court ruled Air Southwest could fly in the state. The three airlines then took the case to the US Supreme Court, which declined to review it.\nSource: Companies History\nAir Southwest's right to fly in Texas was finalized in December of 1970. The carrier officially changed its name to Southwest Airlines in 1971 and commenced operations on June 18 of the same year.\nSource: Companies History\nThe carrier launched with two routes from Dallas Love Field to Houston and San Antonio using three new Boeing 737-200 aircraft. Flights between Houston and San Antonio commenced in November 1971.\nPart of Southwest's immense success was due to Kelleher's focus on unconventional marketing and unique corporate culture.\nSource: Southwest\nKelleher used Pacific Southwest Airways' idea of \"Long Legs And Short Nights\" for hostesses, as they were called at the time, keeping with the theme of hiring attractive women to work Southwest flights.\nSource: Companies History\nThe airline's first flight attendants were described as long-legged dancers and were handpicked by a committee that included the same individual who picked the hostess on Hugh Hefner's Playboy jet.\nSource: Companies History\nKelleher dressed the flight attendants in a bright orange top, orange hot pants, a white belt around the hips, and white side-laced go-go boots. He also pushed for a laid-back, casual inflight experience and only hired female hostesses who were fun, engaging, and had a sense of humor.\nSource: Texas Monthly\nSouthwest also provided a winter version of the uniform, which included orange and white striped hot pants, a blazer, a white top, and an ascot.\nSource: Texas Monthly\nKelleher continued the playboy theme by creating a \"love\" culture at Southwest. The carrier was called the \"love airline,\u201d automatic ticket dispensers were \"love machines,\" inflight snacks were \"love bites,\" and drinks were \"love potions.\"\nSource: Texas Monthly\nThe airline also crafted its own special inflight cocktails, which were free for passengers. A few were appropriately named Kentucky Matchmaker, the Pucker Potion, and the Lucky Lindsay.\nSource: Texas Monthly\nHe even went on to create ads centered around humor and attractive women. In the context of the 1970s, using attractive female flight attendants to gain customers was an industry norm.\nSource: Texas Monthly\nIn 1972, Southwest made a game-changing, innovative marketing move. The company introduced the \"two-tier\" fare system, which established two separate price points aimed at different types of travelers.\nSource: Southwest\nThe fares were the regularly priced \"Executive Class Service\" at $26 one-way and the \"Pleasure Class\" at $13 one-way or $25 roundtrip. \"Pleasure Class\" fares were available after 6:59 p.m. on weekdays and all day Saturday and Sunday.\nSource: Southwest\nThe two-tier structure was a wild success, with Southwest increasing its average passenger load from 17 before the move to 75 after.\nSource: Southwest\nIn 1973, the company launched a $13 one-way \"half-fare\" sale on all flights to San Antonio. Southwest's rival, Braniff, responded with its own \"get acquainted sale\" with $13 fares between Dallas and Houston. This was the start of the $13 Fare War.\nSource: Southwest\nSouthwest knew $13 fares on its only profitable route would run it straight into bankruptcy, so King quickly came up with a marketing campaign that would put Southwest on top. \"Nobody's going to shoot Southwest out of the sky for a lousy $13,\" read the bold ad.\nSource: Southwest\nSouthwest matched Braniff's fare between Dallas and Houston, which was met with praise and respect from customers. As part of the campaign, the airline also offered a free fifth of liquor for passengers who paid the full $26 fare.\nSource: Southwest\nBusiness travelers loved the promotion, and lucky for Southwest, three-fourths of its customers opted to pay full price and pocket the free booze. The airline soon became a fan favorite among many Texas business communities, and Braniff was fuming.\nSource: Southwest\nBy the end of 1973, Southwest finally turned its first profit and would continue to profit for 47 years until the coronavirus pandemic ended the streak. Meanwhile, Braniff lost the battle and the war, ceasing operations in 1982.\nSouthwest's early challenges did not end with Braniff. In 1964, the Civil Aeronautics Board demanded the city of Dallas build an airport to serve the entire Dallas/Fort Worth area. In 1968, every air carrier operating out of Love Field agreed to move to DFW when it opened in 1974.\nSource: Encyclopedia.com\nHowever, Southwest was not a part of that agreement and filed suit that it would not move from Love Field when the new airport opened. The airline claimed there was no legal reason to end commercial traffic at Love Field and that the company made no written agreement to move its operations.\nSource: Encyclopedia.com\nThe city and the DFW Airport Board sued Southwest, saying the CAB rule applied to the airline even if it was made before Southwest was officially founded. However, Southwest argued that its intra-state flights fell outside the jurisdiction of the CAB, so it did not have to leave Love Field.\nSource: Encyclopedia.com\nA federal district court agreed with Southwest and ruled that it could operate out of the airport as long as it remained open. When DFW opened in 1974, every airline except Southwest left Love Field.\nSource: Encyclopedia.com\nSouthwest continued to grow through the 70s, acquiring 10 aircraft and carrying its five-millionth customer by the end of 1977.\nSource: Southwest\nBy 1976, Southwest Airlines had been profitable for three years and proven that government regulation was not necessary for airlines to be successful. Deregulation was a top priority for Jimmy Carter's administration, and it passed the Airline Deregulation Act in 1978, effectively abolishing the Civil Aeronautics Board.\nSource: National Review\nFinally, Southwest Airlines was free to operate interstate flights and the airline began to thrive. Meanwhile, major carriers like Eastern Airlines, Trans World Airlines, and Pan Am spread themselves too thin as they tried to rapidly expand.\nUnlike major carriers, Southwest maintained a simple strategy for success after deregulation, like only operating one aircraft type, cleaning the aircraft before landing to allow for a quicker turn, and focusing on humor in marketing.\nSource: USA Today\nAnd its strategy worked. Southwest was prospering while other airlines like Pan Am and TWA collapsed. However, it was not long before the Wright Amendment put another wrench in the company's plans.\nAfter deregulation, Southwest wanted to commence interstate flights from Love Field to New Orleans in 1979, but officials at DFW airport feared the increased traffic would hurt the airport financially. So, US Congressman Jim Wright drafted, sponsored, and helped pass a bill restricting passenger traffic at Love Field.\nSource: Southwest\nThe law, known as the Wright Amendment, was signed in early 1980 and amended the International Air Transportation Act of 1979. It restricted flying out of Love Field to cities in Texas and the surrounding states of Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and New Mexico. The law was meant to keep Southwest from expanding operations out of Dallas.\nSource: The Dallas Morning News\nIt only applied to carriers that operated aircraft with more than 56 seats, which Southwest did. So, the airline had to rely on short-haul flights in the five-state area to bolster Love Field operations.\nSource: The Dallas Morning News\nIn 1997, Kansas, Alabama, and Mississippi were added to the list of reachable states. In 2005, Missouri was also added.\nSource: The Dallas Morning News\nHowever, in 2004, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly launched efforts to repeal the Wright Amendment, using the slogans \"Set Love Free\" and \"Wright is Wrong\" in the campaign.\nSource: Southwest\nIn 2006, an agreement was made between Southwest, American Airlines, Dallas, and Forth Worth to phase out the law. They agreed that in eight years, the amendment would be gone, but until then, carriers could fly to any US destination out of Love Field as long as at least one stop was made in any of the nine states under the Wright Amendment.\nSource: Southwest, The Dallas Morning News\nOn October 13, 2014, at exactly 12:01 a.m., a countdown clock at Southwest's Headquarters in Dallas hit zero, officially ending the Wright Amendment. A few minutes after, the airline's first scheduled flight outside of the nine Wright states took off from Love Field to Denver.\nSource: Southwest\nThe deal also capped the number of gates at Love Field to 20, and the airport still only has 20 to this day.\nSource: The Dallas Morning News\nWhile the Wright Amendment restricted expansion out of Love Field, Southwest was still able to bolster its network out of other Texas cities in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.\nThroughout the 1980s, the airline expanded north into cities like Tulsa, Oklahoma City, and Kansas City, and west to Phoenix, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, and California. The airline moved east in the late 1980s with flights to Nashville and into the Midwest with flights to Chicago Midway and Detroit.\nSource: Southwest\nThe airline also updated its livery in the 1980s. Southwest wanted to stand out in the skies and make its brand easily recognizable, so it wrapped its fuselage in desert gold and other warm colors. It received its first 737-300 jet in 1984, dubbed Spirit of Kitty Hawk.\nSource: Southwest\nSouthwest's flight attendant uniform was also updated by the 80s. Instead of hot pants and go-go boots, the airline allowed employees to wear real pants and skirts.\nSource: Racked\nIn the 1990s, the network expanded further east to cities like Baltimore, Cleveland, Columbus, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Providence, Islip, and Raleigh-Durham. The airline also began its Pacific Northwest expansion with the acquisition of Morris Air in 1994.\nSource: Southwest\nIn 1991, the \"Friends Fly Free\" campaign was launched to battle the recession. The promotion allowed anyone 18 or older to bring a friend of any age free on their flight. It was so popular that Southwest offered the promotion for the next five years.\nSource: Southwest\nIn 1992, Southwest's most infamous marketing stunt occurred between Herb Kelleher and Kurt Herwald, chairman of Stevens Aviation.\nSource: Southwest\nSouthwest had been using the slogan \"Just Plane Smart\" in its ads, but Stevens Aviation sent a letter to Kelleher noting its similarity to its \"Plane Smart\" slogan.\nSource: Southwest\nInstead of entering a legal battle over the phrase, a Steven Aviation executive suggested an arm-wrestling competition between Herwald and Kelleher. The victor would have full rights to the slogan.\nSource: Southwest\nKelleher marketed the event, dubbed the \"Malice in Dallas,\" which received worldwide press coverage. \"Smokin\" Herb Kelleher and \"Curtsy\" Kurt Herwald put on a full show at the arena, which even earned a congratulatory note from President George Bush.\nSource: Southwest\nAt the turn of the century, Southwest revealed the livery that most people know today. The Canyon Blue color scheme debuted in January 2001.\nSource: Southwest\nWhile many airlines opted to introduce fees for things like checked bags and flight changes to recuperate funds, Southwest refused. Instead, the airline launched its \"bags fly free\" campaign which allows customers two complimentary checked bags. Southwest has not gone back on the offer to this day.\nSource: Southwest\nThroughout the 2000s, Southwest continued to focus on humor in its marketing. Its Wanna Get Away commercials proved successful, which promoted $49 one-way fares.\nSource: Southwest\nBy 2010, Southwest added \"Transfarency\" to its brand. The airline would not have any hidden fees and would remain customer-focused with an emphasis on Hospitality and Heart. The recognizable tri-color heart was added to its airplanes and workplace.\nSource: Southwest\nIn 2011, Southwest acquired AirTran Airways, which opened slots up out of Atlanta and gave it more network expansion opportunities in Mexico and the Caribbean. The two were fully integrated by 2014.\nSource: Southwest\nAlso in 2014, the company's livery got another new look, with a harder focus on the heart, a new logo, and a sleek new color scheme.\nSource: Southwest\nIn July 2014, the airline officially became international with its first flight to Oranjestad, Aruba. In the same month, Southwest also started service to Nassau, Bahamas, and Jamaica.\nSource: Southwest\nThe company's flight attendant uniform got an update in 2017, marking the first time in 20 years the airline changed the look. Womenswear included two dresses, one black with blue and red stripes and the other gray with red and black stripes. Menswear included a black blazer, a gray shirt and pants, and a red tie.\nSource: Travel + Leisure\nIn October 2017, Southwest became the launch customer for the Boeing 737 MAX 8 jet, with its first revenue flight occurring on October 1. However, the aircraft was grounded in 2019 after two fatal accidents involved the MAX. The airline did not fly the plane again until March 2021.\nSource: Southwest\nIn 2019, Southwest reached its goal of operating flights to Hawaii with its inaugural service from Oakland to Honolulu.\nSource: Southwest\nIn 2020, Southwest ended its 47-year profit streak when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Since last March, the airline has remained focused on the health and safety of its customers and employees.\nSource: CNN\nWhile the pandemic was a major blow to Southwest's operation, the carrier has continued to grow with 18 new cities announced in 2020.\nSource: Southwest\nAnd, it is continuing to expand with new routes and destinations, thanks to CEO Bob Jordan, who took over in February 2022.\nSouthwest returned to profitability taking advantage of the post-pandemic travel surge.\nSource: Southwest\nWith Southwest's immense size, it has a lot of systems at play to keep it running efficiently and on time. But, sometimes a nasty winter storm can derail even the best carrier's operations.\nBut, Southwest suffered from more than just the weather in the holiday season of 2022.\nCaptain Mike Santoro, vice president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, told Insider the storm was the catalyst of the meltdown, but \"outdated\" scheduling software created the snowball.\nSouthwest confirmed to Insider that its systems were unable to handle the \"magnitude\" of disruptions, which amounted to over 7,000 from Christmas to December 28 alone.\nSource: FlightAware"

But this didn't come until three days after the outage hit.\n\"The difference between the two statements is vast and shows how subtle differences in approaching crisis responses can drastically alter how effective they are,\" Peer told BI.\n\"Although Kurtz's follow-up response sincerely apologized for the event, its initial absence makes it look delayed in any context and can make any future crisis communication seem disingenuous,\" said Peet.\nSean Griffin, CEO and cofounder of Disaster Tech, agreed that expressing empathy and showing respect were basic crisis communication principles that all leaders should deploy.\nHe believed Kurtz deserves credit for quickly engaging the media on Friday, apologizing, and promising solutions \u2014 even if social media users say the apology didn't come fast enough.\nHowever, the CrowdStrike CEO could have provided more solutions for what those affected could do on their end as the situation was unfolding, Griffin said.\nThe steps to take in a crisis\nGood crisis management can be boiled down to a few simple yet crucial steps, the two experts told BI.\nPeer said the first step is to investigate what happened and understand the scale of the crisis. The next step is to apologize and take responsibility for the misstep.\n\"From there, companies should take every possible step to resolve the crisis quickly and effectively with consistent updates,\" he added.\n\"The company's leadership team must explain to their customers and community what proactive measures will be taken to prevent this crisis from repeating,\" he said.\nGriffin said it is crucial to recognize the importance of having a resilient risk management framework and ensuring you have an experienced team to carry it out.\n\"Crises are part of human life, and it's not an 'if' yet 'when,'\" Griffin said. \"There is no way to avoid it, but there is an opportunity to prepare for it.\"\nLook for a silver lining\nThe impact of the CrowdStrike outage has been estimated to cause losses of $5.4 billion for Fortune 500 companies, excluding Mircosoft, according to an analysis by Parametrix, a cloud insurance provider.\nAttracting new business after a billion-dollar global mess-up may seem unthinkable, but a major crisis doesn't have to be the end of a company, Peer said.\n\"While CrowdStrike's positioning took a major hit in both public sentiment and financial standing, it managed to mostly avoid the more outwardly negative response that some of its clients received for mishandling the outage,\" the ReBlonde co-CEO said.\n\"Delta, for example, shouldered a good amount of public frustration due to the outage affecting countless flights and millions of travelers,\" Peer added.\nGriffin agreed that there could be a silver lining to the situation.\n\"For the companies that prepare and survive crises, the data shows that you generate revenue by gaining market share from competitors or seizing the unfortunate media attention as an opportunity to shine through adversity,\" he said.\nBut as disruption from the CrowdStrike outage slowly lessens, many are still concerned by the in-built potential of technology-reliant systems crashing, bringing down all operations with them.\nHow can that crisis be avoided?\n\"Companies of any size should be operating with clear and robust contingency plans in case of such events,\" Peer said.\nGriffin said his company, which provides crisis management software, is now reviewing its plans and policies to prevent the kind of tech failure CrowdStrike experienced. He recommended that others do the same.\n\"The bottom line is that crisis management is not a check the box; it is an evolution and requires continuous training, exercising, and learning to improve, especially as the nature of threats and types of incidents evolve.\""

      "text": "- Meta has bought nearly half of Scale AI for $15 billion.\n- In theory, that's because Mark Zuckerberg wants to secure Scale AI's data services.\n- But this looks like an acquihire. Is Zuckerberg paying all that money just to hire cofounder Alexandr Wang?\nYou probably don't know who Alexandr Wang is. But that's going to change: The 28-year-old is about to become known as the guy Mark Zuckerberg spent $15 billion on.\nWang is the CEO of Scale AI, a data company that works with giant AI leaders like Meta and OpenAI. And Meta just spent about $15 billion to buy a 49% stake in Scale AI.\nMeta confirmed the deal in a statement late Thursday: \"Meta has finalized our strategic partnership and investment in Scale AI. As part of this, we will deepen the work we do together producing data for AI models and Alexandr Wang will join Meta to work on our superintelligence efforts.\"\nWhat does Meta get for that all-cash investment \u2014 which values Scale AI at close to $30 billion, about double its last valuation from a year ago?\nIn theory, that money lets Meta cement its relationship with a company important to its AI ambitions. In practice, that money buys Wang and perhaps some of his lieutenants.\n\"This is a very expensive acquihire of Alexandr Wang,\" tech analyst Ben Thompson writes, echoing the now-conventional wisdom of the investment.\nAn acquihire is traditionally a deal in which a small startup with limited prospects sells itself to a bigger player, which is usually more interested in the company's employees than the business. Oftentimes, the acquired company stops making whatever it was trying to sell once the deal closes.\nAcquihires are usually considered a \"soft landing\" for startups' founders and employees \u2014 because it secures employment for at least some of them \u2014 and for the startups' investors, who may be able to recoup some of their investment.\nThose deals were quite common in Silicon Valley until recent years, when President Joe Biden's antitrust officials made M&A relatively rare.\nNow they are starting to pick up again \u2014 particularly when it comes to AI, where deals have come with huge price tags. Last year, for instance, Microsoft paid a reported $650 million to AI startup Inflection, in what is technically a licensing fee but is essentially the price to hire company founder Mustafa Suleyman and some of his team. Then Google paid $2.7 billion for a similarly structured deal with Character.AI, primarily to hire founder Noam Shazeer and some of his employees.\nNow Zuckerberg is super-sizing that pattern with his newest deal, and wants Wang to join a new AI lab populated by superstar researchers.\nYou can argue, as Semafor's Reed Albergotti does, that the $15 billion price tag Zuckerberg is paying isn't really an acquihire, since at least some of that money may be considered an advance on future work Scale AI will do for Meta.\nAnd the reference in the Meta statement about the two companies' plans to \"deepen the work we do together\" suggests there's something here beyond Wang's new gig.\nBut most folks I've talked to in tech believe that the real motivation here is to bring Wang into the fold \u2014 in the same way that Apple's $3 billion acquisition of Beats wasn't really because Tim Cook wanted the company's headphone business, but because he wanted the taste and aura of cofounder Jimmy Iovine.\nWhat makes it all the more curious that Wang isn't known as a blue-chip, big-brained AI scientist. He is \"essentially a business guy with technical chops, not the kind of elite researcher Zuckerberg recently had been lavishing with attention \u2014 and offers of gigantic paydays, The Information reports. \"His talents lie in promoting the company rather than managing its staff or furthering AI research, according to multiple people who have worked with him,\" per the Financial Times.\nAnd regardless of what Zuckerberg thinks Wang can do for him, he has plenty of cautionary tales from his past, where he has bought up high-profile talent who end up leaving. Both the cofounders of Instagram and the cofounders of WhatsApp have left the company after Zuckerberg spent billions on them, and Instagram cofounder Mike Krieger is now essentially competing with Meta, via his role as chief product officer at Anthropic.\nThe flip side of the argument: There aren't many companies that can afford to burn billions on a hiring deal, but Meta is definitely one of them. And if you've convinced yourself, as Zuckerberg apparently has, that the future of tech \u2014 and your business \u2014 is AI, then any amount you spend will be worth it in the end if it works out."

At the same time, it suspended its guidance for the coming fiscal year, citing the CEO transition and the state of the business.\nFor starters, Niccol said in-store orders would need to be fulfilled much faster than they currently are in many cases.\n\"I'm putting a full-court press on solving four minutes,\" he said.\nOne way he said this would happen is by bringing back the condiment bar to company-owned locations by early 2025, allowing cups of brewed coffee to skip the queue of more-complex orders.\nNiccol also said the chain would stop charging extra for non-dairy milk, which he said was the second-most-popular drink modification after an extra shot of espresso.\nHe highlighted several changes he wanted to bring back in an effort to \"reclaim the third place\" and make the caf\u00e9s a place to hang out with a cup of coffee, including comfy seating, ceramic mugs, and Sharpie markers for baristas to add \"that additional human touch\" to orders.\nSeveral other initiatives were reported in the days before Wednesday's call, including a requirement that corporate employees work in the office at least three days a week and a menu shake-up that will end the brand's olive-oil-infused coffee offerings.\nSince taking over the job in September, Niccol has focused on simplifying Starbucks' US menu and operations, including pivoting away from the chain's emphasis on promotions, drive-thru, and mobile ordering.\n\"Mobile orders are a huge problem because you could have 20 people place a mobile order at the same time, and then they all come through at once,\" a barista in North Carolina told Business Insider in August.\nThat deluge of orders has contributed to long wait times and an impersonal atmosphere in caf\u00e9s that Niccol has said he wants to fix.\nNiccol hinted that \"guardrails\" in mobile ordering were in the works, saying that the current system invites overly complicated orders that aren't necessarily the best execution of the drink.\nWhile Niccol didn't deeply address Starbucks' China segment, he said the company was facing twin challenges of an economic slowdown and rising competition from Chinese brands.\n\"Before discussing China in detail, I need to spend time there to better understand our operations and the market,\" he said.\nNiccol said his optimism was rooted in Starbucks employees, whom he said were passionate about coffee, the company, and its customers.\n\"When you start with that kind of foundation, you know, you're able to put in the right programs so that we can get the business turned around,\" he said.\nCorrection: October 31, 2024 \u2014 Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this story misstated when Starbucks released its most recent quarterly numbers. It was last Tuesday, not last Wednesday."

On January 16, Blue Origin launched New Glenn, its first orbital rocket.\nSpaceX developed its first orbital rocket, the Falcon 9 v1.0, in 2005. The rocket made its debut launch in 2010.\nIn December, Bezos told the journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin at the New York Times DealBook Summit that he thought Blue Origin was \"not a very good business yet.\"\n\"I think it's going to be the best business that I have ever been involved in, but it's going to take a while,\" Bezos added.\nThe move by Limp, who worked for more than a decade at Amazon, echoes Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's desire to have fewer middle managers \u2014 part of a wider tech flattening trend.\nJassy told Amazon employees in September that he wanted to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% by the end of March, which he argued would \"decrease bureaucracy\" and improve the company's speed.\nMeta has made similar moves. In 2023, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company didn't want a structure \"that's just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work.\"\nRead Blue Origin CEO David Limp's memo:\nFrom: David Limp\nDate: Thursday, February 13, 2025, at 7:10 a.m.\nSubject: Difficult Org News \u2014 Changes To Our Team\nFolks,\nWe just finished this morning's meeting, during which I gave an update on our organization. As I mentioned, we have made the tough decision to reduce our workforce by about 10%. The impact this has is not lost on any of us\u2014we are saying goodbye to our friends and colleagues who have helped us build Blue into what it is today.\nI know this is a lot to absorb, and I would like to explain how we got here. Over the last few months, as a leadership team, we have worked together to define our 2025 Annual Operating Plan and growth strategy. Our primary focus in 2025 and beyond is to scale our manufacturing output and launch cadence with speed, decisiveness, and efficiency for our customers. We grew and hired incredibly fast in the last few years, and with that growth came more bureaucracy and less focus than we needed. It also became clear that the makeup of our organization must change to ensure our roles are best aligned with executing these priorities. Sadly, this resulted in eliminating some positions in engineering, R&D, and program/project management and thinning out our layers of management.\nWhile I acknowledge that these messages are better delivered personally and individually, the reach of these changes across multiple locations and teams makes that difficult. We will notify impacted employees immediately via their work and personal email addresses of their status with Blue. We will also email employees who are not impacted to confirm their employment with Blue. Both emails will arrive by 7:30 A.M. PT/10:30 A.M. ET today. While our sites are open, I encourage you to work from home for the rest of the day if your role allows you to do so.\nWe are doing what we can to support everyone impacted. The email notifications will provide support details, which include severance packages, COBRA coverage, career support services, and access to counseling through our Employee Assistance Program.\nLet me add that I am extremely confident in the enormous opportunities in front of us and have never been more optimistic about our mission. We will continue to invest, invent, and hire hundreds of positions in areas that will help us achieve our goals and best serve our customers. We will be a stronger, faster, and more customer-focused company that consistently meets and exceeds our commitments. This year alone, we will land on the Moon, deliver a record number of incredible engines, and fly New Glenn and New Shepard on a regular cadence.\nTo our colleagues who are impacted today, thank you so much for your hard work and passion for our mission. I hope we all support one another with grace and empathy while upholding our leadership principles during this time.\nDave"

The company's vice president of human resources, Janelle Gale, said in the memo announcing the changes that the term DEI had \"become charged\" partly because it's \"understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others.\"\nIt also made changes to its content-moderation policies earlier that week, including getting rid of third-party fact-checkers in favor of a community-notes model similar to X's.\nIn March 2023, Meta laid off 10,000 workers \u2014 the second wave of cuts at the company in four months \u2014 in what Zuckerberg called Meta's \"year of efficiency.\"\nMeta didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nRead the full memo below:\nMeta is working on building some of the most important technologies in the world \u2014 AI, glasses as the next computing platform, and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams. I've decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster. We typically manage out people who aren't meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we're going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle \u2014 with the intention of backfilling these roles in 2025. We won't manage out everyone who didn't meet expectations for the last period if we're optimistic about their future performance, and for those we do let go we'll provide generous severance in line with what we've provided with previous cuts. We'll follow up with more guidance for managers ahead of calibrations. People who are impacted will be notified on February 10 \u2014 or later for those outside the US. Letting people go is never easy. But I'm confident this will strengthen our teams and help us build leading technology to enable the future of human connection."

      "text": "- Ray Dalio is again promoting the idea that China urgently needs to start a \"beautiful deleveraging.\"\n- China is sitting on massive debt levels, and it's making businesses and people hold on to cash.\n- Dalio argued that Beijing must free up indebted businesses and get them to borrow again.\nThe billionaire investor Ray Dalio thinks China can save its economy through two major debt policies, though that would require big changes to how China has operated for years.\nHowever, the Bridgewater Associates founder argued that if China doesn't enact them soon, the country risks suffering as Japan did in its \"Lost Decade.\"\nIn a LinkedIn post, Dalio wrote of what he called a \"beautiful deleveraging,\" or an aggressive two-pronged approach to solving debt issues.\nDalio argued that while the Chinese leader Xi Jinping's unprecedented stimulus sparked a \"big week\" for economic optimism, it wouldn't be enough.\nIf China wants its big week to go down in the history books as a turning point, Dalio said, then Beijing has to \"do what it takes, which will require a lot more than what was announced.\"\nWhat's a 'beautiful deleveraging'?\nThe concept isn't new for Dalio, whose company runs the biggest foreign hedge fund in China. He coined the term \"beautiful deleveraging\" after the 2008 crisis.\nHe says the first move involves a country restructuring bad debts to free up beleaguered borrowers from their loan commitments.\nHe wrote that they'd have to be spread out over time \"in a balanced way\" to avoid leaving debtors out to dry and prevent a shock to the economy.\nThe billionaire added that China should simultaneously lower interest rates to encourage fresh loans. He said the interest-rate cuts would ideally be so drastic that they run below inflation and nominal growth rates.\nIf the government can't implement that policy, it could monetize debt while weakening China's currency to lighten the burden, he said.\nThese measures essentially aim to give China's struggling borrowers \u2014 of which there are now many \u2014 some breathing room to grow their businesses while encouraging them to borrow more and take risks.\n\"This beautiful deleveraging can only be done in countries that have most of their bad debts denominated in their own currencies and have most of the debtors and creditors as their own citizens, which is the case for China,\" Dalio wrote.\nWhy China's massive debt is seizing up its economy\nChina's economy has been slammed by swelling debt levels after years of businesses and local governments gobbling up loans on lax interest rates, only for many to later find themselves overleveraged.\nThe country's debt-to-GDP ratio is nearly three times as high as it was 10 years ago, and that's been fueling pessimism as major sectors like real estate buckle under the weight of their lending payments.\nBecause of it, many businesses and people have been holding on to their cash and not spending, thereby stalling the economy.\nDalio believes a \"beautiful deleveraging\" would help the country climb out of that rut, largely by making it so that holding cash in the bank would be one of the most unattractive options in China.\n\"Doing these things starts to rekindle 'bottom fishing' and 'animal spirits,'\" he wrote. \"We are clearly seeing that happen now.\"\nMajor 'painful' changes needed\nStill, Dalio said his \"beautiful leveraging\" would cause Beijing to face \"difficult and painful changes.\"\nA debt restructuring would fundamentally reshape how years of previous loans in China have been handled and could badly hit many people's wealth, especially if they lose out on the new terms, he said.\n\"Imagine the situation of a perfectly good company that lent to the local government and/or is dependent on local government spending facing the current situation,\" Dalio wrote. \"Who should do what in what amounts to deal with this situation?\"\nDalio also urged a reform of China's tax system, arguing that it has been \"highly ineffective at the national, provincial, and local government levels\" and made it difficult for regional governments to stay out of the red.\nAnd he warned of China's rapidly aging population, describing a recent move to raise the retirement age as a \"minor change in policy.\" The decision was already deeply unpopular and rewrote a decadeslong standard that retirement was possible at 50.\nYet Dalio emphasized that China is at a crossroads. If Beijing doesn't start a \"beautiful deleveraging,\" he said, it risks allowing its crisis to drag on and create \"an economic and psychological malaise like Japan experienced.\"\nChina's debt crisis is one of five challenges that Dalio believes the country faces in a \"100-year storm.\" The others are the climate crisis, the US-China tech war, souring ties with Washington, and growing wealth inequality.\nThe investor has long styled himself as bullish on China but regularly speaks out on fiscal decisions he thinks the country should make to avoid catastrophe."

      "text": "- Meta has begun to cut thousands of jobs to focus on AI investment and efficiency.\n- Mark Zuckerberg is targeting low performers, part of a broader industry move toward leaner operations.\n- Some employees told Business Insider they're anxious about the changes.\nMeta has begun to cut thousands of jobs as the social media giant takes a tougher stance on underperforming employees and readies its finances for another year of heavy AI investment. Affected employees in Europe, Asia, and the US have started to be notified, per an internal post viewed by Business Insider.\nThe company has said it will eliminate roughly 5% of its workforce, which could mean almost 4,000 employees lose their jobs.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg told staff in January he would \"raise the bar\" and move quickly to remove low performers, according to an internal memo seen by BI.\nThis is part of a broader push by Big Tech companies to make themselves leaner after a hiring spree during the pandemic. Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, and others are collectively eliminating thousands of employees.\nZuckerberg has been at the forefront of this, announcing a \"year of efficiency\" in 2023 that has continued through last year and into 2025. Wall Street has rewarded Meta for this new focus, sending the company's shares soaring since the start of 2023 \u2014 a run that's added more than $1 trillion to Meta's market valuation.\nWhile Meta remained profitable through recent periods of heavy hiring and big spending, the company is now racing to keep up with rivals in the generative-AI race. This requires billions of dollars in infrastructure and related investment. That's likely putting pressure on Zuckerberg to seek cost savings elsewhere.\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment.\nImpact on some employees\nMeta is offering impacted workers in the US a severance package that includes 16 weeks of pay and an additional two weeks for every year of service, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nFor some Meta employees, the efficiency drive is causing anxiety. These staffers asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics.\n\"Mark is creating fear,\" a Meta employee told BI. \"He's creating a culture where you have to be loyal to him or else.\"\nAnother employee said that working at Meta right now \"feels like living in a George Orwell novel.\"\nEven colleagues who have performed well \"have been disappearing all year, and when you ask about it, you're just told, 'They're no longer with the company,'\" this person said. \"Self-censorship is rampant. At a company supposedly dedicated to connecting people, the human side of our work is disappearing, and everyone is acting more robotic.\"\nAnother Meta employee said reductions shouldn't be branded as performance-based cuts because this could damage people's reputations as they seek other opportunities.\n\"Now people have to go back out into the job market with a label that is incredibly unfair,\" this person added.\nThey expressed concern that good employees would be cut just to meet quotas and that this could have a negative impact on morale.\n\"What's the incentive to help a new hire ramp up if they're just going to stack rank us and probably do this all again next year?\" this person added.\nHow Meta's latest job cuts may work\nThe job cuts are designed to target employees who receive \"met some\" or \"did not meet\" ratings, the bottom two categories in Meta's assessment system, in their performance reviews.\nInternal guidance obtained by BI last month says managers must identify 12% to 15% of employees eligible for these ratings. Meta aims to reach 10% \"nonregrettable attrition\" by combining these cuts with previous departures. For example, if a team had 5% attrition in 2024, managers would need to identify another 7% to 10% of their employees for the bottom ratings to meet the target.\nOne Meta employee told BI that forcing managers to place team members into bottom categories for job cuts had spread anxiety through the management ranks as well as the rank and file.\nOn Friday, employees received a memo from Janelle Gale, Meta's vice president of human resources, detailing how the process should work. The memo, which was obtained by BI, said affected employees would be notified through their work and personal email addresses and lose access to company systems within an hour of being informed. They'll receive information on their severance packages in the same email, it added.\nThe notifications will be staggered across time zones, with employees in the Asia Pacific region being notified first, followed by those in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and then, finally, North and Latin America, the memo said.\nEmployees in European countries such as Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands will be exempt from this process because of local regulations and will instead follow local performance management processes, the memo said. Meta intends to backfill these roles, it added, but plans and timelines \"may vary.\"\nHow Meta is reorganizing itself\nAmid the cuts, the social media giant is also reorganizing some of its businesses and divisions.\nThe company is merging its Facebook and Messenger teams under Facebook's chief, Tom Alison, while Messenger's head, Loredana Crisan, is set to move to the generative-AI group, The Information said.\nMeta's Reality Labs division, which has lost nearly $60 billion since 2020, is being more tightly integrated with Meta's main business, reversing some of Zuckerberg's 2021 reorganization. In an internal memo obtained by BI, Reality Labs' chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, said Reality Labs had \"become a positive driver for Meta's overall brand.\""

      "text": "- Kroger and Albertsons are facing off against the FTC in court over their proposed $24.6 billion merger.\n- The FTC argues the merger would reduce competition and raise grocery prices.\n- The fate of the biggest supermarket merger in US history could come down to a federal judge's decision.\nThe fate of the largest supermarket merger in US history hangs in the balance as an ongoing three-week hearing unfolds inside an Oregon federal courtroom.\nSupermarket giants Kroger and Albertsons are duking it out in court against regulators who are trying to block the companies proposed $24.6 billion merger over antitrust concerns.\nThe chains argue that Kroger's acquisition of Albertsons would boost competition with behemoth retail rivals like Walmart, Costco and Amazon, while regulators from the Federal Trade Commission allege the opposite, saying the deal is actually anticompetitive and would result in higher grocery prices for millions of Americans, as well as lower wages for workers.\nBoth sides are currently making their case before US District Judge Adrienne Nelson, who will ultimately decide at the end of the hearing next month whether to approve the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction against the merger.\nAlready this week, a Kroger executive's internal email about price hikes for eggs and milk beyond the added costs from inflation has drawn scrutiny in the courtroom.\n\"This cherry-picked email covers a specific period and does not reflect Kroger's decades-long business model to lower prices for customers by reducing its margins,\" a Kroger spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement. \"What's missing is the fact that Kroger's retail prices include the cost to run a grocery store, including labor, transportation, advertising and other costs. Many of these costs have significantly increased since 2020. Kroger's pricing decisions are impacted by factors beyond inflation.\"\nIf the judge overseeing the hearing ultimately rules in favor of the FTC, the deal between Kroger and Albertsons could end up torpedoed completely. A temporary injunction would put the merger on ice as the FTC holds a separate in-house proceeding over the deal before an administrative law judge.\n\"This merger will not occur if this injunction is in place,\" Kroger attorney Matthew Wolf told the court on Monday as the federal court hearing kicked off in Oregon.\nWolf said that the FTC's internal administrative process is so drawn out that merger deals typically collapse before the proceedings are completed.\nIn his opening statements to the court on Monday, Wolf argued that the merger would instantly lower some prices for patrons at Albertsons stores, where company officials disclosed are up to 12% higher than Kroger's.\nThe attempt by federal regulators to lower prices by blocking the merger shows that \"they neither understand the industry nor the parties within it,\" said Wolf.\n\"Supermarkets are losing this food fight, and who are they losing it to? Walmart, Costco, and Amazon, among others,\" Wolf told the court.\nAlbertsons attorney Enu Mainigi said that the retailer may be forced to close stores and lay off workers if the merger does not go through.\nThe FTC's chief trial counsel, Susan Musser, argued in her opening statement on Monday that the proposed merger \"would eliminate the competition that shoppers and workers depend on in one fell swoop.\"\n\"This lawsuit is part of an effort aimed at helping Americans feed their families,\" Musser said.\nDozens of witnesses are expected to testify at the hearing over the next couple of weeks, including the CEOs of Kroger and Albertsons.\nRegulators sued to block the Kroger-Albertsons merger deal earlier this year\nIn February, more than a year after Kroger and Albertsons announced the merger mega-deal, the FTC sued to block it.\nAttorneys general in Arizona, California, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Wyoming and the District of Columbia all joined the FTC's lawsuit. The attorneys general in Colorado and Washington have also filed separate lawsuits in an attempt to halt the deal.\n\"Kroger and Albertsons are two of the largest supermarket chains in thousands of local communities throughout the country,\" attorneys argue in the FTC lawsuit. \"In hundreds of those communities, the proposed acquisition would create a single supermarket with market shares so high as to be presumptively unlawful under the antitrust laws.\"\nThe lawsuit alleges that \"the proposed acquisition would also eliminate the substantial head-to-head competition between Kroger and Albertsons that exists today, which risks higher prices and lower quality for consumers.\"\nThe FTC says in its lawsuit that the stakes for Americans are \"exceptionally high\" as the agency notes how grocery prices have risen significantly in recent years.\n\"The fierce competition between these two grocery giants has benefited millions of American consumers through lower prices for food and household essentials,\" the lawsuit says. \"It has also benefited hundreds of thousands of grocery store workers who, as a result of competition for their labor, earn better wages and benefits.\"\nIt continues, \"If allowed to proceed, the proposed acquisition would destroy this competition, likely making it more expensive for millions of families to put food on the table.\"\nMeanwhile, Kroger filed a lawsuit against the FTC last week, arguing that the agency's administrative proceeding against the merger violates the Constitution while citing, in part, a recent Supreme Court ruling.\n\"The merger between Kroger and Albertson's is squarely focused on ensuring we bring customers lower prices starting day one while securing the future of good-paying union jobs,\" Kroger CEO and chairman Rodney McMullen said in a statement at the time.\n\"We stand prepared to defend this merger in the upcoming trial in federal court \u2013 the appropriate venue for this matter to be heard \u2013 and we are asking the Court to halt what amounts to an unlawful proceeding before the FTC's own in-house tribunal,\" McMullen said.\nKroger operates more than 2,700 stores across 36 states under names including Fred Meyer, Dillon's and Smith's, while Albertsons controls more than 2,200 stores across 35 states under banners like Safeway, Shaws, and Acme.\nIn 2022, Kroger and Albertsons generated more than $148 billion and $72 billion in revenues, respectively.\nAs part of the proposed merger, Kroger and Albertsons said they would sell 579 stores to the grocery supply company C&S Wholesale Grocers."

      "text": "Nike is planning another round of layoffs as part of CEO Elliott Hill's efforts to realign the business and get it back to growth, CNBC has learned.\nThe cuts will impact less than 1% of Nike's corporate staff. It's unclear how many jobs will be impacted. Nike's EMEA and Converse businesses will not be impacted.\n\"As we shared in Q4 earnings, NIKE, Inc. is in the midst of a realignment. The moves we're making are about setting ourselves up to win and create the next great chapter for NIKE,\" the company told CNBC in a statement. \"This new formation is built to put sport and sport culture back at the center, to connect more deeply with the athlete and the consumer, and to give us the space to create what only NIKE can.\"\nLast February, Nike announced plans to lay off 2% of its staff, or more than 1,500 jobs, as part of a broader restructuring. The latest round of layoffs is part of Hill's efforts to change how teams are structured within the corporation.\nUnder former CEO John Donahoe, Nike changed the way its business was segmented. Instead of being divided by sport, it was divided into women's, men's and kid's as part of a broader effort to grow its lifestyle business.\nSome critics say that adjustment was among the reasons that Nike's innovation pipeline fell apart as the company focused on lifestyle products geared to a wide range of consumers, instead of being directed at athletes.\nHill, a longtime Nike veteran, is now undoing that work so the business is squarely focused on sports and culture. After Hill shared his vision in June, leaders were identified in July to head the new teams, the company said, adding a \"small number\" of staff will depart as a result of the shifts.\nIn a memo to staff, Nike said as part of the changes, some staff will take on a new position or level, report to a new manager or join a new team.\nStaff will learn if they're impacted during conversations by Sept. 8. The majority of the new roles will take effect on Sept. 21.\n\"To make space for these conversations, corporate employees based in an office location in the U.S. and Canada will work remotely next week, unless otherwise informed by your leader,\" the memo said.\nSince taking the helm of the world's largest sportswear brand, Hill has been on a mission to reverse an ongoing decline in sales, reignite innovation and win back wholesale partners.\nWhen announcing fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in June, Nike said it expects its sales and profit declines to moderate in the quarters ahead, indicating the worst is now behind it and the fruits of its turnaround could come sooner than expected. In a call with analysts at the time, Hill hinted at the realignment that's now starting to materialize.\n\"Instead of a men's, women's and kids construct, Nike, Jordan, and Converse teams will now come to work every day with a mission to create the most innovative and coveted product, footwear, apparel and accessories for the specific athletes they serve,\" said Hill.\nHill said the company would organize into \"sport-obsessed teams\" which would \"drive a relentless flow of innovative product across all three of the brands.\""

      "text": "- Nike's CEO Elliott Hill said that there are three things he wants to fix at Nike.\n- One mistake was being \"too promotional\" and offering too many discounts.\n- The company will also focus on five areas: running, basketball, training, football, and sportswear.\nNike's new CEO said that two months into the job, he's working hard to fix three key mistakes that the sneaker maker has made in recent years.\nHill rejoined the company in October as chief executive after retiring from his post as president of marketplace and consumer in 2020. He's a true insider, having worked his way up from an apparel sales representative intern in 1988.\nHis post came at a crucial time for Nike, which has been struggling with lackluster sales and dealing with the backlash of trying to sell directly to consumers instead of through marketplace retailers. The company's stock is down more than 36% in the last year.\nOn Thursday, the company reported revenue of $12.4 billion, down 8% from the year before, for the three months ending November 30.\nOn Thursday's earnings call \u2014 Hill's first in the new job \u2014 he highlighted three mistakes he's trying to amend:\n1. Becoming \"far too promotional\"\nHill said that the retailer has been offering too many discounts and becoming \"far too promotional.\"\n\"Entering the year, our digital platforms were delivering roughly a 50/50 split of full price to promotional sales,\" he said. \"The level of markdowns not only impacts our brand but it also disrupts the overall marketplace and the profitability of our partners.\"\nTo counter this, Hill said that Nike would rein in the number of sales.\n\"Being premium also means full price,\" he said. \"We'll focus promotions during traditional retail moments, not at the consistent levels we are today, and we will leverage NIKE Value Stores to profitably move through any excess inventory.\"\n2. Losing its \"obsession with sport\"\nHill also highlighted a big-picture reorientation.\n\"We lost our obsession with sport,\" Hill said on the call.\n\"Moving forward, we will lead with sport and put the athlete at the center of every decision,\" he said, adding, \"We will get back to leveraging deep athlete insights to accelerate innovation, design, product creation, and storytelling.\"\nHill said Nike is focusing on five categories: running, basketball, training, football, and sportswear. Training refers to performance wear for sports training-related activities, while sportswear refers to more casual athleisure apparel.\nAnalysts have previously slammed Nike's innovation stagnation.\nJim Duffy, a Nike analyst for Stifel Institutional, told BI's Lloyd Lee in September that the company had fallen behind, relying too much on its retro line.\n\"From a product standpoint, there's been kind of an air pocket of innovation,\" Duffy said. \"The brand, the revenue base, and the profit pool became overly dependent on a short list of retro styles. As they will do, consumer preferences have changed.\"\n3. Souring relationships with marketplace retailers\nThe third mistake that Nike has made, Hill said, was to sour its relationships with marketplace retailers.\nPre-pandemic, the company started pushing direct-to-consumer sales and cut ties with small sporting goods stores and sneaker boutiques. And it reduced product allocations for sneaker giants like Foot Locker and Dick's Sporting Goods.\n\"The final action we prioritize is building back and earning the trust of our key wholesale partners. Some partners and channels feel we've turned our back on them and we stopped engaging consistently,\" Hill said.\nHe added that he personally connected with the top executives of retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods, Foot Locker, and JD Sports, and named them on the call.\nDuffy, the Nike analyst, previously told BI that Nike had \"de-emphasized some of the wholesale distribution,\" which had \"created oxygen for some competitors to gain shelf space and recognition.\"\nWholesale revenue was down 3% in the last quarter, to $6.9 billion, from a year ago. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Poonam Goyal wrote that out of the last quarter's results, \"better-than-expected wholesale and apparel revenue were the standouts, with each besting consensus by a wide margin.\"\nHill's comments come shortly after Nike and Foot Locker announced that they would deepen their partnership by expanding Foot Locker's interactive Home Court basketball section."

The GenAI organization is a core part of Scale that manages its work on some of the best-known AI chatbots like xAI's Grok and Google's Gemini.\nThe move was abrupt, one source told BI, with employees shut out of systems and deactivated from Slack even before they woke up.\nQuestions about Scale AI's long-term sustainability have swirled since Meta's investment, with some of Scale's biggest clients like Google abruptly halting projects in the wake of the deal. The company has also faced questions around the security practices of its training documents, as revealed through Business Insider's reporting.\nScale remains well-funded and is committed to growth and hiring hundreds more employees in different sectors, the startup told BI.\n\"As a result of this restructuring, some members of this org will be leaving Scale today,\" the email reads. \"To ensure a smooth process and give people the necessary space, please do not come into the office.\"\nIn addition to Alexandr Wang's departure, several VPs, chiefs of staff, and researchers have left Scale AI following the Meta investment, according to LinkedIn and a source. The company didn't comment on specific employee departures.\nLaid-off ScaleAI employees will be paid as normal through September 15, and then receive a minimum of four weeks of additional pay if they sign the company's severance agreement, per a separate email to the affected employees obtained by BI.\n\"We're streamlining our data business to help us move faster and deliver even better data solutions to our GenAI customers,\" Scale AI spokesperson Joe Osborne told BI. \"We also plan to make significant investments and hiring across our enterprise and government AI businesses.\"\nHere is the full email from Scale AI's CEO Jason Droege to Scale AI's GenAI employees:\nHi team, After reviewing our company and its operations, I've made the decision to restructure several parts of the GenAI organization. I believe these changes will best position us for the long-term, make the org more efficient, and allow GenAI to focus on the biggest and most profitable opportunities. As a result of this restructuring, some members of this org will be leaving Scale today. To ensure a smooth process and give people the necessary space, please do not come into the office. All impacted FTEs will receive an email to their personal email address by 8am PT and badge and IT access will be removed. For those not impacted, I will share more details later this morning on the restructuring and our path forward. I know news like this is tough, but please know how grateful I am for the work this team has done. Whether you're directly affected by these changes or not, every one of you has helped build Scale into the company it is today and the accomplishments it has made. Thank you again."

      "text": "- USAID will cut nearly all staff, reducing its workforce from over 10,000 employees to 290.\n- Trump and Musk have criticized USAID for being wasteful and supporting liberal causes.\n- USAID spent $32.5 billion in 2024, focusing on health and humanitarian aid.\nFederal workers are suing to stop the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development, which faces cuts to nearly all of its over 10,000 staff by Friday.\nThe cuts would reduce employment numbers to 294, Randy Chester, vice president of the American Foreign Service Association at USAID, said in a press conference on Thursday announcing a lawsuit against President Donald Trump and members of his administration that seeks injunctive relief to halt the cuts.\n\"The rest of the service will be furloughed and put on administrative leave, pending, but we assume there will be a reduction,\" he said.\nOne USAID employee who asked to remain anonymous told Business Insider that \"the whole region of sub-Saharan Africa will be left with 12 staff members \u2014 or less.\"\nThe Trump administration's move to gut the foreign aid agency will also halt the contracts administered abroad by USAID.\nOn Tuesday evening, USAID announced it would put nearly all its staff on administrative leave beginning on Friday at 11:59 p.m., with exceptions to people with \"exceptional circumstances,\" said Secretary of State Marco Rubio. USAID said it would arrange return travel with the State Department within 30 days.\n\"We're not trying to be disruptive to people's personal lives, we're not being punitive here, but this is the only way we've been able to get cooperation from USAID,\" Rubio, USAID's acting director, said Thursday from the Dominican Republic.\nThis comes after Donald Trump and Elon Musk both attacked the agency for being wasteful and backing liberal causes, with Musk calling it a \"criminal organization\" on X.\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents about 800,000 federal workers, filed a lawsuit with the American Foreign Service Association on Thursday, naming President Donald Trump, Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, the State Department, USAID, and the Treasury Department as defendants.\nAttorneys representing the plaintiffs called the move by the Trump administration a constitutional and moral crisis.\nThe White House did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\nUSAID oversees programs in 65 countries focusing on medical assistance, food and nutrition, HIV treatment, and aid to people in conflict zones. Data reveals that USAID spent nearly $32.5 billion in aid in fiscal year 2024, with the most amount of aid sent to Ukraine, Jordan, and Ethiopia. Half of the funding went to either humanitarian or health and population purposes, while another $7 billion was spent on governance.\nForeign spending accounts for less than 1% of the US federal budget, though the US is the world's largest humanitarian aid provider.\nMany leading Democrats and legal analysts have argued that shuttering USAID is illegal, as an independent agency can only be closed by an act of Congress.\nFive days into Trump's term, the US froze billions in humanitarian aid intended for health, education, and anti-corruption purposes, among other purposes.\nTrump has recently suggested his administration may try to shutter the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Justice."

      "text": "- Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway posted a 14% drop in first-quarter operating profits on Saturday.\n- Berkshire sold a net $1.5 billion of stocks and grew its cash pile to a record $348 billion.\n- Buffett has been stymied by hefty valuations for stocks, acquisitions, and buybacks.\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a 14% drop in first-quarter operating profits to $9.6 billion ahead of Buffett speaking at the company's much-watched annual meeting in Omaha on Saturday.\nBerkshire's insurance underwriting division's 49% year-on-year profit decline to $1.4 billion was largely to blame for the company's overall earnings decline.\nThe famed investor's conglomerate sold a net $1.5 billion of stocks, as it bought $3.2 billion on stocks and sold $4.7 billion worth. The disposals marked the 10th straight quarter that it's been a net seller of stocks.\nHowever, the sales were significantly smaller than last year, when Berkshire sold a net $134 billion of stocks in just 12 months.\nThe disposals contributed to a 4% increase in Berkshire's cash pile to a record $348 billion, or $333 billion if $14.4 billion of payables for Treasury purchases are subtracted. That figure exceeds the market capitalizations of most S&P 500 companies, including Bank of America and Coca-Cola.\nBuffett didn't opt to repurchase any Berkshire shares last quarter, making it three straight quarters without any buybacks.\nThe bargain hunter and his team have been thwarted by lofty valuations for public stocks, private businesses, and even Berkshire shares in recent years.\nThe lack of opportunities \u2014 and Berkshire cutting key positions Apple and Bank of America last year \u2014 has boosted its cash pile to record levels.\nRegardless, Berkshire Class B shares have soared 20% this year to trade at all-time highs of about $540. The stock has benefited from tariff turmoil that has pushed the S&P 500 down 3% this year, as investors seek haven in Berkshire and bet on Buffett to capitalize if the market crashes."

      "text": "- Southwest Airlines unveiled its turnaround plan on Thursday as pressure mounts to stem losses.\n- The airline's new strategy includes a redesigned cabin, assigned seating, and route changes.\n- Checked bags will still be free, Southwest said.\nWhatever you thought you knew about Southwest Airlines is about to change.\nThe airline on Thursday revealed a dramatic turnaround plan, scrapping its unique playbook of more than 50 years in favor of an airline that largely resembles most of its peers.\nIn a 112-slide presentation for investors, executives laid out plans for assigned seating, extra-legroom seats for purchase, a redesigned cabin, and other behind-the-scenes initiatives designed to increase revenue and turn around an underperforming stock price.\nThe announcements, together with an increased third-quarter revenue forecast and a new share buyback program, helped Southwest's stock price climb more than 10% in early trading Thursday. Shares have dropped nearly 50% since the pandemic decimated airline balance sheets industry-wide.\nWhen and how Southwest's famous open seating will disappear\nSouthwest first announced plans in July to end its long-standing open seating policy in favor of assigned seats. It said 80% of customers surveyed preferred an assigned seat.\nBoth regular and enhanced seats will be available for selection at booking, starting in 2025 for flights in early 2026, Southwest said.\nThe company's unique boarding process, which relies on position numbers, will largely remain the same. It said this will maintain efficient operations while allowing its most loyal customers and passengers who book premium seats will be among the first to board\nSouthwest unveils its version of premium-economy\nSouthwest will maintain its all-economy cabin but give extra legroom to about a third of its seats, which it says is preferred among business and leisure travelers alike.\nThe enhanced rows will offer up to five inches of additional pitch on top of its standard 31 inches.\nSouthwest said the new seating options would drive demand and extra revenue, noting that they could generate similar revenue with minimal seat loss compared to adding a business class or blocking a middle seat.\nIn August, analysts estimated that assigned seating could generate up to $2 billion in near-term revenue.\nNew and improved cabin\nSouthwest has already announced an improved cabin with tablet holders, charging ports, upgraded overhead bins, and better WiFi.\nWhile the seats have received backlash for their slim appearance, Southwest said they are preferred over the current ones by 400%. The airline also plans to add additional comforts like a six-way headrest and more cushioning.\nThe cabin improvements come as Southwest plans to cut some short-haul flying in favor of more lucrative long-haul operations.\nRestructuring its route map\nSouthwest is shaking up its route network to eliminate some less profitable routes. Atlanta and Chicago's O'Hare are among the biggest hits, both losing about a third of their flights. Southwest was the second-largest operator in Atlanta behind Delta Air Lines, leaving customers with fewer choices.\nSouthwest left four airports altogether in August: Bellingham International Airport in Washington, Mexico's Cozumel International Airport, Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, and Syracuse Hancock International Airport in New York.\nThose cuts free up space for more profitable routes, such as six new flights from Nashville and its first-ever red-eye flights in early 2025.\nSouthwest said the restructuring will improve its network connectivity and efficiency.\nBehind-the-scenes improvements\nSouthwest is adopting many strategies of its so-called mainline peers in an effort to tap into new revenue streams. Specifically, the airline said it wants to establish international partnerships to expand its overseas operations and generate more demand.\nIts first partner will be Icelandair, with its first flight scheduled in 2025 through Baltimore-Washington International Airport. This means Icelandair passengers can connect in the US on Southwest flights, and vice versa. Southwest said Icelandair is just the start, with at least one more partner to be announced next year.\nSouthwest also wants to improve its \"turn time\" \u2014 or how long a plane sits at the gate between flights \u2014 and commit to a 24-hour operation to better utilize its fleet, freeing up more aircraft to operate more flights beginning next year.\nCustomers can also expect technology improvements, the ability to book full vacation packages, and changes to the airline's Rapid Rewards loyalty program. Details of the updates remain vague, but Southwest said top-tier status holders will gain more perks, and eventually, the program will extend to international operations once airline partnerships are in place.\nFree bags are here to stay\nDespite pressure from an activist investor, Southwest is not giving up its famous two free checked bags. The airline said research shows the fan-favorite policy is the most important thing that sets it apart from the competition.\nIt said removing the unique strategy would lower demand and \"far outweigh any revenue gains created by imposing and collecting bag fees.\"\nIn 2023, global airlines made $33 billion in bag fee revenue."

It's not easy to make all these changes at once, but it's even harder to have them roll out gradually throughout the year, and so we asked leaders to do all they could to pull these decisions forward. As a result, about 300 Stripes, largely in product, engineering, and operations roles, are departing today.[0] All those who are impacted have already been informed, and everyone will receive a severance package, including their earned annual bonus.

      "text": "- CNN said it would cut about 200 roles focused on its TV operations.\n- The news organization also plans to hire about the same number in digital-focused positions.\n- CEO Mark Thompson said last year that he wanted to \"future-proof\" CNN.\nCNN, the cable-news giant owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, said it would cut about 200 TV-focused roles as part of a digital pivot.\nThe company also said it would hire about the same number of staffers in digital-focused roles and aim to fill 100 of them in the coming months.\nThe cuts would affect about 6% of CNN's workforce, though the new roles mean total head count is unlikely to be significantly affected.\nWBD is providing $70 million in funding as part of a drive to reach $1 billion in digital revenue by 2030.\nMark Thompson, the CEO of CNN, told staff in a memo on Thursday that he aimed to \"shift CNN's gravity towards the platforms and products where the audience themselves are shifting and, by doing that, to secure CNN's future as one of the world's greatest news organizations.\"\nCNN also said it planned to introduce a streaming-news product accessible on devices in the US and elsewhere.\nIn October, CNN brought in a paywall, charging some of its most loyal readers $4 a month for access to digital content.\nThompson, a former CEO of The New York Times Company and director-general of the BBC, took over at CNN in 2023. He cut about 100 jobs in July as part of what he called a drive to \"future-proof\" the company against cable news' decline.\nThursday's announcements drew mixed reactions from current and former employees.\nOne business-side staffer expressed confidence that Thompson had the right strategy to get CNN on track after a chaotic period under predecessor Chris Licht and the ouster of Jeff Zucker before him.\n\"He has the room and has a plan,\" the person told Business Insider. \"But it's not going to come easy.\"\nGreg D'Alba, former longtime president of CNN News Networks and a close watcher of the network, wondered how CNN would use technology to gather news, establish credibility, and reach younger audiences who mistrust traditional news sources.\n\"Simply launching FAST channels and streaming products isn't enough,\" he said. \"The brand must also enhance its core utility by building a foolproof system for delivering trustworthy and reliable information and not just moving talent around.\"\nRead the memo Thompson sent to CNN staff.\nDear All, Two weeks ago, at our first town hall of 2025, I told you that I knew there was plenty of anxiety at CNN about future organizational change and that, as soon as we were able to go into detail about the changes, we'd do it right away. That moment has arrived and today you'll be hearing not just from me but from several of my senior colleagues about the next phase of change at CNN. The changes we're announcing today are part of an ongoing response by this great news organization to profound and irreversible shifts in the way audiences in America and around the world consume news. From linear to digital, fixed to mobile, traditional long-form broadcast to any number of different formats and use-cases. It isn't and can't be a single set of changes but a process of investment, experimentation and adaptation that will last years. Our objective is a simple one: to shift CNN's gravity towards the platforms and products where the audience themselves are shifting and, by doing that, to secure CNN's future as one of the world's greatest news organizations. America and the world need high quality, fair-minded, trustworthy sources of news more than ever. This difficult and sometimes painful process of change is the only way to make sure we can still provide it. Today's news is first and foremost about investing in that future. Yes, there are job-losses \u2014 around 6% of the current CNN workforce will be impacted \u2014 but we don't expect total headcount to fall much this year, if at all. That's because of the $70 million we're investing in our digital plans and the many new jobs it will pay for. Some of that money's going in product and tech, but a lot is also going into new high-quality journalism and storytelling. It's what we stand for. It's also the heart of every successful digital news strategy. At the same time, I know that whatever the total number of job losses, the impact on the individuals involved can be immense. The process of change is essential if we're to thrive in the future, but I both acknowledge and regret its very real human consequences. My colleagues will go into more detail about the changes, but here is a summary of key headlines: STREAMING CNN Max has been a tremendous resource for us. We have been able to get our journalism and storytelling content in front of Max's 110 million global subscribers and test and learn to see what programming a mass streaming audience engages with, spends time with, and returns time and time again to the service to consume. We'll continue to have a strong presence on Max, but we also believe it is not a complete answer to the future of the great linear CNN experience. Today, I can announce that we plan to develop a new way for digital subscribers at home and abroad to stream news programming from us on any device they choose. It's early days but we've already established that there's immense demand for it not just in America but across much of the world. We'll have more to say about this new digital product in the coming months, including content plans and how we will work with our existing and future distribution partners to bring this to market. DIGITAL The new Digital Products & Services organization has accomplished a great deal in the short nine months since Alex MacCallum joined CNN to lead it, including establishing our first direct-to-consumer subscription product, launching vertical video carousels on all of our digital platforms, refreshing the whole CNN.com site, launching the Digital Magic Wall and the live commentary module, creating new innovation teams and building new data analytics and digital business support capabilities, and much else besides. Now, in addition to the work of developing that new streaming product, Alex will announce a set of further initiatives, including a further major pivot to digital video, the development and launch of CNN's first lifestyle-oriented digital product, working with News to innovate in our multimedia storytelling capabilities, and creating new premium digital ad experiences to drive sustainable and scalable advertising revenue. She will also detail a restructure of her leadership team, to include the creation of new Content and Transformation, Audience and Features teams to round out her direct reports. With this, we are also posting many new roles at all levels of the organization as part of Warner Bros. Discovery's investment in this strategic work and CNN's path forward. Recruiting the right people will take some time, but we hope to open up and fill at least 100 new posts in the coming months to help execute the new plans. A FRESH NEW TV SCHEDULE Innovation also touches our traditional TV experience. For many years ahead and, notwithstanding our streaming plans, the most economically significant expressions of the CNN TV experience will be our two great television services: CNN, the historic US cable channel that enters its 45th year in 2025, and CNN International. Today, we are announcing refreshed schedules for the weekday domestic lineup that bring energy and competitive edge to our delivery. A revised international schedule will follow in a few days' time. These changes are intended to strengthen our domestic schedule throughout the day and deliver international programming to a wider audience around the world. We're able to achieve that with this new schedule, which will be shared and distributed broadly later today, while also placing our production costs on sustainable footing to match the changing economics of linear television platforms. Like the rest of our industry, we have to respond to these economics if we're to maintain high quality services for our loyal existing audiences. We're also streamlining and adjusting some important aspects of how we produce our TV programming going forward. The changes we made in morning programming a year ago both improved performance and reduced costs. Building on that successful experiment and with similar objectives in mind, we now plan to change the way we deliver programming elsewhere in the schedule. Starting today, Eric Sherling and John Davies will walk colleagues through these changes. FURTHER MODERNIZING OUR NEWSROOM In 2024, our newsroom took on the complex and challenging task of merging into a single integrated organization, breaking down silos between separate digital, TV and international newsrooms. After just a few months of the new structure, we've seen measurable progress and clear signs that our new Follow the Sun structure is working. We've seen it help us capture global breaking news as it happens and deliver the resulting content simultaneously across multiple formats and platforms. The newsroom has also risen to the challenge of providing outstanding distinctive subscriber-only content to support our new digital subscription business as well as playing a key role alongside Digital Product & Services in developing our plans for verticals and features. Today, we're making further announcements in the Global News organization. We're creating a new Video News Editorial organization as the next stage in our effort to coordinate and strengthen our video capabilities across all platforms, including linear TV. We're transforming our DC bureau to align it with our new multiplatform model, which we introduced elsewhere last summer. We're integrating CNN en Espa\u00f1ol more closely into CNN's main Global News operation. We're opening an important new senior role in the news organization and welcoming some outstanding new leaders \u2014 including Phil Rucker from the Washington Post as SVP Editorial Strategy and News and a new London Bureau chief you'll hear about shortly. JOB IMPACTS As I noted at the top, some of today's announcements mean significant new job opportunities at CNN, but others will lead to the loss of some valued colleagues. That too is an unwelcome but inevitable part of the change process. We will aim to contact every colleague who will be impacted by these changes as soon as we possibly can \u2014 and will of course help and support them in any way we can thereafter. In the year and a quarter since I arrived at CNN, we've had an incredible period of news and have already made significant progress on our transition to the future. I am grateful to every one of these colleagues for everything they've done for this company in my time and the years before. MOVING FORWARD 2025 has only just begun and yet we've already seen more than enough news at home and abroad to be reminded just how important it is that this great news organization succeeds. Given our brand and reputation, given the incredible talent at our disposal, given that spirit of innovation and commitment that has always been a hallmark of CNN, I truly believe that we can do just that. Thank you for everything you do for CNN and for the audiences across America and around the world that depend on us. Mark"

      "text": "Few prints are as emblematic as the Burberry check. For more than a century, the black, white, red, and tan plaid has represented a certain level of British sophistication and, more practically, a defense against even the worst wet weather.\nBut earlier this summer, the cracks in fashion powerhouse Burberry's foundations became very apparent. In July, after reports that it was cutting hundreds of jobs, Burberry said sales had fallen 21% year-over-year in the first quarter and that it would suspend its dividend. On the heels of earnings, the company also announced it was ousting its CEO, Jonathan Akeroyd.\nThe market has not responded kindly. Burberry's stock is down 24% since the news and 49% so far this year.\nIt's a strong about-face for the brand and has left many wondering what exactly went wrong.\nThe answer is a combination of too-high prices and too-high fashion.\nBurberry has shifted away from its bestsellers, like the classic trench, into avant-garde looks that don't appeal to a broad market. It's also pitted itself against bigger, more established luxe players \u2014 with limited success.\n\"They tried to be a major fashion player because fashion was back in fashion,\" Jelena Sokolova, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, told Business Insider. \"It was the same with boosting leather goods. Neither of these things, I would say, are extremely strongly in the brand DNA.\"\nTake handbags. Being an exclusive fashion name means playing in the competitive world of overpriced bags, one of the most high-margin items a luxury house can sell. But Burberry hasn't been able to keep up with the likes of Louis Vuitton or Gucci.\nWhat's left is a confused brand with little direction and too many discounts and outlet stores.\nBut things aren't hopeless at Burberry, which did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. A strategy that focuses on the brand's core products \u2014 its outerwear \u2014 and eschews a bloated price structure in favor of more broad appeal could help turn the company around.\nFrom technical fabric to a golden age\nLike many legacy brands \u2014 Herm\u00e8s, Louis Vuitton \u2014 Burberry was created for practicality, not for fashion's sake. Thomas Burberry, the founder, invented a proprietary fabric in 1879 with the goal of protecting customers from the notoriously poor British weather.\nThe fabric was about performance, and the company's history boasts about explorers in the early 20th century wearing the gear to the Arctic Circle or on long-distance hot air balloon rides.\nIt wasn't until 100 years later, in the early 21st century, that the brand really became a force in fashion.\nFrom 2001 to 2018, designer Christopher Bailey ran Burberry and turned it into a global name. While focusing its design on Burberry's heritage and its classic plaid, he also modernized the business, making runway collections available right after the show and building an online presence. It may not have been very high-fashion, but it worked.\n\"When things were good, the brand was outperforming the industry,\" Sokolova said.\nTrying to be a 'major fashion player'\nBut every golden age comes to an end, and after Bailey was also named Burberry CEO in 2014, the brand started to decline.\nThe company had begun to lag behind its peers, and a move to bring in new leadership in 2018 was lauded by industry watchers who had just seen Gucci transform under Alessandro Michele.\n\"We believe this is a necessary move to make Burberry exciting again,\" Luca Solca, then the head of luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas, wrote in a note, The New York Times reported in 2017, when it was announced Bailey would be leaving. \"Creative directors \u2014 like all artists (painters, composers, singers) \u2014 tend to produce variations on a theme. Most brands that have gone through a revival had to first find new creative resources.''\nPart of that revival was an attempt to go upmarket \u2014 both in terms of look and price.\nBurberry looks designed by Ricardo Tisci, who followed Bailey as creative director, leaned away from the traditional.\n\"I wanted to celebrate the amazing brain of England,\" Tisci told Vogue in 2019. \"The beauty, the avant-garde, the real individualism.\"\nBut Burberry's sweet spot was never the avant-garde but classic trench coats, a lesson Tisci's successor and Burberry's current designer, Daniel Lee, would learn when he leaned too heavily into leather goods.\nOver the past couple of years, Burberry has tried to become a player in the luxury handbag market, a high-profit opportunity, to little avail. The company started churning out bags that matched the prices of those from leather goods houses like Louis Vuitton, charging 58% more than its legacy leather goods products.\nIt was a move that Solca, now at Bernstein, called \"overambitious\" in a June note. And customers weren't buying it \u2014 or the bags.\n\"They have been trying to boost their leather goods business, but of course it's a very uphill battle,\" Morningstar's Sokolova said. \"They pushed the pricing where the brand didn't feel legitimate. I've heard from some people, with a $2,500 bag, you might as well just go for Louis Vuitton, you wouldn't buy Burberry.\"\nDesigner Lee has also added to the brand's muddled image. He adopted a new signature color and a new logo, leaving consumers who wanted classic Burberry just as confused as they were with Tisci.\nThe result is a series of contradictions: a British heritage brand known for its trench coats trying to become a high-end maison, and a label with increasingly expensive products that has had to turn to outlets and steep discounts when those products didn't move.\n\"Burberry was trying to expand into categories and price points where it did not have sufficient brand desirability or heritage,\" Adam Cochrane, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Research, told BI over email. \"The combination of higher price points and more sales via outlet channels was always hard to reconcile, and the company never managed to navigate this well.\"\nEven chairman Gerry Murphy admitted things had \"moved a bit too far, too fast with the new aesthetic\" during the July earnings call.\n\"Convincing consumers that they need to spend more for its products would only be possible if Burberry became very hot and very desirable,\" Solca wrote in his June note. \"This is currently not the case, and most likely will only change gradually.\"\nIn the luxury trenches\nNot all of Burberry's problems are of its own making; the entire luxury sector is facing challenges.\n\"If the general sentiment is weak, the brands that have the weaker momentum, they get discarded first,\" Sokolova said. \"They get the most hurt in a downturn.\"\nWith inflation squeezing aspirational shoppers, it's natural that if they are going to splurge, they will do it on a brand that's considered a good investment. Those are more likely to be iconic styles that have been in fashion for years \u2014 a Louis Vuitton Neverfull, say, or Chanel Flap bag \u2014 than a style from Burberry, a brand not known for its bags.\n\"It's been a tougher market where customers are more cautious, more conservative, not just about price but on style,\" Murphy said during the July call.\nThere's also China, a difficult market for the entire sector right now. Consumer sentiment in the region has fallen, and shoppers are choosing to take their money to Japan, where the yen has been weak.\nAnd Burberry is doing even worse than its peers there, which partially reflects Chinese customers' shift \"to brands which have been able to better reflect heritage and desirability,\" Cochrane said.\nBurberry's comparable store sales in Mainland China fell 21% during the first quarter. Luxury bellwether LVMH's revenue in the Asia-except-Japan region dropped 13% in the first half of the year.\n\"It is difficult to reposition a brand in a challenging macro environment, and Burberry's high exposure to the slowdown in China does not help,\" Anne-Laure Bismuth, a director of luxury and sporting goods research at HSBC, told BI.\nIn the region, shoppers associate the brand with discounts, Bernstein research found, meaning its offerings are far from the investment pieces or \"wear for five year\" items that people typically want during tough economic times.\nCheck, please!\nIndustry onlookers seem to agree Burberry is at a crossroads and can go one of two directions, with one being substantially easier. The brand can continue its price hikes and attempt to go high fashion \u2014 plus close most of its 56 discount outlets, Bismuth said \u2014 or it can go back to basics and stop trying to compete with the Louis Vuittons and Guccis of the world.\nThe first would come with \"the consequence of impairing its earnings significantly for at least three to five years,\" Bismuth said; most analysts BI spoke to see going back to basics as a more surefire way for Burberry to succeed.\nPart of a strategy of shrinking away from being a very upmarket high-fashion brand would be to lean into what works \u2014 namely, the trench.\nWhile Burberry was built as an outerwear brand, outerwear currently only makes up 30% of its revenue, and trench coats make up just about 10%, Sokolova said. Apparel, one of the slowest growing parts of luxury, makes up about 60%.\n\"I wish that they would focus on their iconic products,\" Sokolova said. \"From an advertising and product perspective, that should be the focus to revitalize the brand.\"\nOuterwear makes up more than 70% of the revenue of Moncler, she said, a brand known for its winterwear. Moncler has outperformed Burberry year-to-date; by leaning on what it knows works \u2014 it doesn't even make handbags \u2014 the company has been less exposed to the squeezes facing the luxury sector.\nJust like Herm\u00e8s needs the Birkin and the Kelly, Burberry needs the trench and the scarf, and even the brand admits it has strayed too far from its heritage. In a July memo, the company said it would \"emphasise more of the timeless, classic attributes that Burberry is known for\" and \"a broader everyday luxury offer.\"\nPart of this would also mean reducing those sky-high prices of recent years, but in reality, the company was already offering steep discounts and selling at outlets.\nIt looks like management agrees that highbrow is not the way to go, given the new CEO, Joshua Schulman, is a veteran of Coach and Jimmy Choo, two upmarket brands that have iconic collections yet aren't exactly uber-luxury.\nMaking Burberry a British Coach or Michael Kors \"would possibly generate higher cash flows and profits,\" Solca wrote in a November 2021 note.\nPerhaps there is a way for Burberry to weather the storm after all."

      "text": "- Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have plans for DOGE, and Workday sees an opportunity.\n- Workday aims to capitalize on federal agencies' shift from on-premises to cloud systems, its CEO said.\n- The federal government, the largest US employer, could face layoffs under DOGE's agenda.\nAs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy gear up to try to reshape large swaths of the federal government, one big software player sees an opportunity.\nWorkday, the human-resources-software company that workers love to hate, is embedded in more than half of Fortune 500 companies. The $72 billion company has been building up its government customer base, from Oklahoma's Tulsa County to the US Department of Energy. In 2022, Workday was approved to work with the federal government.\nNow that Musk and Ramaswamy's Department of Government Efficiency is set to advise President-elect Donald Trump on rescinding regulations and cutting administrative costs, Workday and other government vendors could stand to benefit.\nOn Workday's Tuesday earnings call, CEO Carl Eschenbach addressed an analyst's question about how DOGE could impact Workday's business.\nEschenbach said more than 80% of the federal government's HR systems were physically housed on local servers, what's called \"on-premises.\" Companies and organizations have been steadily migrating from on-premises servers to the cloud for cost savings, better security, and efficiency, among other benefits.\n\"Postelection and with DOGE coming out, people are absolutely looking to drive more economies of scale and more efficiency. And I can tell you supporting these on-premises, antiquated systems is not a way to do that,\" Eschenbach said.\nEschenbach added that federal agencies were at an \"inflection point\" and ready to move to the cloud \u2014 and Workday has a government-focused product to sell them.\n\"We think this will only be a tailwind for us as we think about the federal government business going forward,\" he said.\nWorkday said in May that it would work with the Department of Energy and the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\"These are critical wins for us and it's actually driving demand for us in the federal government as people recognize Workday is really pushing hard into that market,\" Eschenbach said on Tuesday's call.\nIn the last quarter, Workday brought in $2.2 billion in revenue \u2014 a 16% increase from last year. The company doesn't break out revenue by customer type. Workday's stock is up 14% in the past year.\nThe company didn't respond to a request for comment sent outside business hours.\nLast week, Musk and Ramaswamy named several of DOGE's targets in a Wall Street Journal opinion column: work-from-home arrangements, Planned Parenthood, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and general head count, among others.\n\"DOGE intends to work with embedded appointees in agencies to identify the minimum number of employees required at an agency for it to perform its constitutionally permissible and statutorily mandated functions,\" the pair wrote.\nThe federal government is the largest employer in the US, with a workforce of more than 2 million Americans, so the group's suggestions could have wide-ranging implications.\nThe Washington Post reported on Sunday that notable Silicon Valley figures \u2014 including the Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale, the investor Marc Andreessen, the hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman, and the former Uber CEO turned food-tech entrepreneur Travis Kalanick \u2014 had been involved in DOGE's early planning."

Google had already been winding down its work with Scale AI, two contractors working on its projects told BI.\nOpenAI and Elon Musk's xAI have paused some Scale AI projects, too, Scale AI contractors working on them told BI. A smaller Scale AI investor told BI they are selling their remaining stake in the startup because they don't think Meta's investment can make up for the loss of Big Tech clients.\nThese developments are the latest evidence that Scale AI could face challenges to its business, sparked by Meta's blockbuster deal to buy 49% of the startup and hire its founder Alexandr Wang. Scale AI helps Big Tech clients train and improve their latest AI models. An investment from a major AI competitor like Meta throws that relationship into doubt.\nBI spoke to 10 Scale AI contractors, who said several projects from Meta's AI competitors have been put on ice. They asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\"As a whole, the nature of this business naturally fluctuates and dips do not imply a change in the relationship,\" a Scale AI spokesperson said. In a blog post, Scale AI's interim CEO Jason Droege said Scale remains \"unequivocally\" independent and has \"multiple promising lines of business.\" In another note, Scale said it won't provide Meta with confidential information about its customers.\nGoogle declined to comment. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the company was winding down its work with Scale AI. xAI and Meta didn't respond to requests for comment from BI.\nReuters reported last week that Google is planning to cut ties with Scale AI amid concerns about Meta accessing information about the search giant's latest AI developments.\nGoogle work 'may have dried up'\nLess than 24 hours after Scale AI announced its investment deal with Meta on June 12, contractors working on multiple Google projects \u2014 with codenames like \"Genesis\" and \"Beetle Crown\" \u2014 received emails seen by BI notifying them that their work was being \"paused.\"\nOne US-based contractor told BI they'd spent the last few months working on a Google project designed to help Gemini answer tough biology prompts. The contractor was earning $50 an hour until their work was suddenly stopped the same day the Meta deal was announced, despite having been assured weeks before that the project would be ongoing.\n\"The Beetle Crown group chat just suddenly disappeared, and people were wondering what happened. It wasn't communicated well, and that only adds to the sense of like, 'I have no project now. I'm totally lost,\" the contractor told BI.\nGoogle had previously \"paused\" and not resumed a separate large-scale AI project with Scale in the spring of this year, leaving workers scrambling as Google work became increasingly hard to find, two contractors told BI.\nScale AI told BI the spring pause was \"not a notable event from our perspective\" and that this kind of closure happens regularly.\nReuters previously reported that Google was Scale AI's largest customer last year, spending $150 million on its services alone last year \u2014 almost 20% of Scale AI's revenue.\nContractors who spoke with BI said work with Scale AI is now hard to come by, with dashboards showing far fewer available projects \u2014 or in some cases empty \u2014 compared to before the Meta deal.\n\"Work has been extremely scarce for most of us, and now it may have dried up almost completely,\" another Scale AI contractor who had been working on Google-related projects told BI.\nA different contractor, whose dashboard showed several paused or inactive projects on Wednesday, said he lost access to all those projects overnight.\nAn internal dashboard of Scale's generative AI projects and clients from April, reviewed by BI, showed Scale AI was running at least 38 active projects for Google at the time \u2014 more than a third of Scale AI's 107 generative AI projects on that list. The dashboard also listed active projects for other major clients, including Apple, xAI, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon.\nAmazon, Microsoft, and Apple didn't respond to requests for comment from BI.\nxAI and OpenAI also paused some Scale AI projects\nAs BI previously reported, Scale AI's work for xAI includes a major project called Xylophone. This project involves training xAI's chatbot to improve its conversations on a wide range of topics, from the zombie apocalypse to life on Mars.\nThree contractors working on several Xylophone projects told BI their dashboard showed several of them on pause since the Meta investment.\nOne said they had spent most of their time working on Xylophone.\n\"Long story short, I am now in a state where I have been told that there are no projects for my specialty or location,\" they said.\n\"The fact that there's nothing else to work on right now just sucks,\" another contractor said.\nAnother contractor working on an OpenAI project said their work was also paused last week. The team was told they would no longer be working on the project, but were not given a specific reason.\n\"You can put two and two together,\" the contractor told BI.\nConfirming OpenAI's work with Scale AI was winding down, OpenAI's spokesperson said Scale AI accounted for a small fraction of its overall data work and that it had increased its need for expertise that went beyond what Scale AI could offer.\nOne investor is getting out of Scale AI\nScale AI's announcement promised that its business with Meta would \"substantially expand\" following the investment.\nIt's unclear whether that expanded relationship can offset the revenue hit from losing major clients like Google.\nOne CEO at a rival firm told BI they've seen a spike in inbound requests from former Scale clients since the Meta deal closed.\nThe investor selling off their remaining stake in Scale AI said they didn't understand how Scale AI could be valued at $29 billion by Meta now that top customers, especially Google, are leaving."

      "text": "Intel plans to lay off up to a fifth of its factory workers, an enormous cutback that will have a profound effect on one of the chipmaker\u2019s core businesses.\n\u201cThese are difficult actions but essential to meet our affordability challenges and current financial position of the company. It drives pain to every individual,\u201d Intel manufacturing Vice President Naga Chandrasekaran wrote to employees Saturday. He said the company is targeting job reductions between 15% and 20%, with most of the cuts taking place in July.\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive viewed a copy of the email, whose authenticity was confirmed by four employees.\nIntel declined to comment on Saturday\u2019s memo but reiterated that the company would \u201ctreat people with care and respect as we complete this important work.\u201d\n\u201cRemoving organizational complexity and empowering our engineers will enable us to better serve the needs of our customers and strengthen our execution,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are making these decisions based on careful consideration of what\u2019s needed to position our business for the future.\u201d\nIntel announced the pending layoffs in April and notified factory workers last week that the cuts would begin next month. It hadn\u2019t previously said just how deep the layoffs will go.\nThe company had 109,000 employees at the end of 2024, but it\u2019s not clear how many of those worked in its factory division \u2013 called Intel Foundry.\nThe Foundry business includes a broad array of jobs, from technicians on the factory floor to specialized researchers who work years in advance to develop future generations of microprocessors.\nIntel is planning major cuts in other parts of its business, too, but employees say the company hasn\u2019t specified how many jobs it will eliminate in each business unit. Workers say they believe the impacts will vary within departments.\nOverall, though, the layoffs will surely eliminate several thousand jobs \u2013 and quite possibly more than 10,000.\nNext month\u2019s layoffs will take place at Intel factories around the world but could have an especially big effect in Oregon, the heart of the company\u2019s manufacturing operation. The chipmaker employs 20,000 in the state, more than any other business.\nIntel eliminated 15,000 jobs across the company in 2024, including 3,000 in Oregon. The company is responding to a protracted decline in sales and a bleak near-term outlook, driven by intense competition in PCs and data centers and Intel\u2019s failure to develop advanced chips for the booming market for artificial intelligence.\nLast year\u2019s cuts came through layoffs, buyouts, early retirement offers and attrition. This time out, Intel has indicated it doesn\u2019t plan to offer any voluntary buyouts. Instead, it will choose which workers it doesn\u2019t want based on investment priorities and individual performance.\n\u201cThese reductions will be based on a combination of portfolio changes, level and position elimination, skill assessment for remaining positions, and some hard decisions around our project investments,\u201d Chandrasekaran said. \u201cWe are also taking into consideration factory operations impact.\u201d\nLast year, the Biden administration awarded Intel $7.9 billion in federal subsidies to support new or expanded factories in Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico and Ohio. Intel received $1 billion of that money from the federal CHIPS Act last year but much of the rest appears to be in limbo while the Trump administration re-evaluates the awards.\nIntel has delayed the opening of its first Ohio factory until 2030, a tacit acknowledgement there isn\u2019t enough demand for its chips to justify the $10 billion investment to equip the facility.\nOregon also awarded Intel $115 million in state funds. The timing of a planned expansion to its D1X research factory in Hillsboro is unclear and the state funds are subject to clawback if the expansion doesn\u2019t hit hiring targets or boost state tax revenue.\nNew Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has repeatedly emphasized a need to streamline Intel\u2019s operations, reduce layers of management and to move faster to deploy new technologies. Tan has also said he wants to retain and recruit more top-flight engineers.\nMajor layoffs will make that a difficult balancing act, as Intel seeks to persuade current and former employees that it has a bright future even as it makes dramatic cuts in its operations.\nIntel shares rose 3% Monday to $20.74. The stock has traded between $17.67 and $37.16 in the past year.\n-- Mike Rogoway covers Oregon technology and the state economy.

      "text": "- Elliott Investment Management launched a podcast to influence Southwest Airlines shareholders.\n- The activist investor holds 11% of Southwest and is seeking a top-level shake-up.\n- Podcasts offer cheaper, controlled communication that have the potential to reach retail investors.\nLast week, activist firm Elliott Investment Management launched a podcast as part of its efforts to influence Southwest Airlines shareholders.\nElliott, which built an 11% stake in the US airline, has called for a new CEO and board members. The firm also told Southwest to review its operations and develop a plan to improve performance.\nSouthwest's stock has shed nearly half its value in the last five years, and its passenger volumes are below pre-pandemic levels despite strong travel demand. On an earnings call in July, company executives said revenues were hurt because Southwest did not optimize summer demand and faced overstaffing because of Boeing's plane delivery delays.\nSouthwest's CEO, Bob Jordan, has been with the company for three decades and was appointed as chief in 2022. Elliott said Jordan and chairman Gary Kelly are responsible for the company's underperformance.\nThe activist hedge fund started its public campaign against Southwest's leadership in June and called for a December 10 shareholder vote to decide on Elliott's eight board nominees.\nSouthwest's 15-member board consists of 13 independent members, according to a filing. Last month, the company said it intends to appoint four new independent directors, potentially including some of those proposed by Elliott.\nElliott said its \"Stronger Southwest\" podcast will have one-on-one conversations with the firm's nominated directors. The first episode \u2014 an interview with former WestJet CEO Gregg Saretsky \u2014 was released last week on platforms including Apple Podcasts and Spotify. The video version has 3,900 views on YouTube.\nWell before the first episode dropped, the airline started making changes \u2014 and more are likely on the way. Last month, Southwest introduced a dramatic turnaround plan, scrapping its unique playbook of more than 50 years, which included open seating, in favor of becoming an airline that resembles most of its peers.\nThe airline and Elliott are now working on a settlement that would give the hedge fund representation without controlling Southwest's board, Bloomberg reported on Monday.\nWhile it is unclear if new episodes of the podcast will still be released amid settlement talks, communication strategists told Business Insider that Elliott's novel move has benefits, including cost-effectiveness.\nCheaper and more direct\nTraditionally, activist investors have communicated directly with investors, because most companies have 10 to 20 major shareholders who decide their elections, said Scott Bisang, a founding partner of financial communications firm Collected Strategies.\nBut companies like Southwest and Disney, which saw similar activist interest last year, have a lot of individual investors.\n\"You can't call every retail shareholder, and sending direct mail to every holder multiple times is expensive,\" Bisang said.\nA podcast allows the activist to completely control the content, compared to a media outlet shaping an interview. Shareholders may subscribe to the podcast and get notifications directly, which could create a recurring benefit if they watch more than one episode. If lots of people subscribe, the activist could collect data and retarget ads to investors through other channels, Bisang said.\nBefore the podcast, Elliott rolled out a website and accounts on Instagram, X, and YouTube.\nCas Sydorowitz, the global CEO of shareholder engagement service Georgeson, said an activist's podcast could go beyond investors, since employees, customers, and suppliers might also listen.\n\"Investors understand the need to communicate with shareholders and other stakeholders to garner support for their director candidates,\" Sydorowitz said. \"Hosting a podcast is a new and potentially effective way for an activist to showcase the qualifications of their director candidates.\"\nPodcasts are the new activist battleground\nEarlier this year, Disney was caught in a proxy war against activist investor Nelson Peltz.\nAt Disney's annual meeting in April, shareholders voted to keep CEO Bob Iger and Disney management's board and rejected the activist's two candidates.\n\"While Disney didn't do its own podcast series last year, they actually advertised heavily on entertainment podcasts like 'The Town,'\" a podcast about Hollywood, Bisang said.\nIf the Southwest battle continues, he said to expect direct paid ad campaigns from both sides.\n\"It's no different than what we see with a presidential election, except in a proxy fight, you can target advertising much more specifically on your investor base versus every voter in a state,\" Bisang said.\nSouthwest and Elliott did not respond to requests for comment."

It made \"news the star,\" and steered clear of politic bias. After defining itself with on-the-scene reporting during the Gulf War, for a long time, CNN was the nation's news \"emergency room.\" People tuned in for breaking coverage of terrorist attacks or election results.\nBut as American media became more politically aligned, it wasn't enough. Coming into the 2010s, CNN was struggling. In 2013, former NBC head, Jeff Zucker was hired to run the network. Despite providing more political commentary, by October 2019, CNN settled into third place in viewer ratings, falling behind Fox News and MSNBC for the 10th quarter in a row.\nOn CNN's political right, Fox News has continued its upward march in the ratings. Since 2002, it's been the most-watched cable news network in the country, in part because of the prescient plan put forth by its former CEO, Roger Ailes.\nBut Fox News is a brand based on personalities. And in the last few years, it's lost them. Ailes, its leader, and Bill O'Reilly, one of its most recognized anchors, were both booted after numerous sexual misconduct allegations became public. Megyn Kelly moved to NBC. In 2019, Shepard Smith, one of the most prominent Fox News straight news presenters, left as well.\nThe other elephant in the room is President Donald Trump. Since 2016, viewership at both networks surged thanks to his presidency. But he's also accelerated the polarization of political media, boosting Fox News when it praises him and turning CNN into a punching bag on the right for remaining nonpartisan.\nHere's how the two networks have changed over the last 10 years.\nCNN specializes in straight news and Fox News in opinion. But the trajectory of these two rivals is intertwined.\nIt's no coincidence that Fox News' rise has relegated CNN to second or third place in ratings.\nBefore Fox News was created, its owner, Rupert Murdoch, had been \"at odds\" with CNN's founder Ted Turner for years. He wanted to beat and discredit CNN.\nSo, in a way, Fox News was forged out of enmity for CNN.\nCNN began operating in the 1980s, with an aim of \"making news the star.\"\nCNN was an institution without overt political bias.\nIn 1991, it showed what it could do with its singular live coverage of the Gulf War. It reported from within Baghdad after all the other media organizations had left.\nFox News was the newcomer, having launched in 1996.\nIt positioned itself as the network \"for the unrepresented, for the outsiders,\" according to Terry McDermott in the Columbia Journalism Review. McDermott also wrote, \"There is a strain of resentment, of put-upon-ness that pervades almost everything Fox puts on the air.\"\nThe future of the new network was taken seriously from the beginning. In the early years, it was investing about $80 million annually on operation costs.\nBut in 2000, it was still operating with such loose production values that one of its reporters was caught picking his nose on camera.\nBut since 2002, it's been the highest-rated cable news channel in America.\nIts rise was due to chief executive Roger Ailes, and his producers, who knew how to develop simple narratives and deliver them effectively.\nIts tagline was \"Fair & Balanced.\"\nCNN has always had a large editorial staff. In 2010, it had 4,000 employees, the most out of any of its competitors.\nThat enabled it to cover more original news than Fox.\nBut its problem \u2014 a significant one by 2010 \u2014 was that while major breaking news provided ratings boosts, it wasn't enough to keep viewers coming back on a consistent basis.\nFox News was the opposite.\nIt had about a third as many reporters and editors. And other than an often-overlooked straight-shooting newsroom fronted by Shepard Smith, its great strength was in opinion journalism.\nIt was more of a talk-show network than a news network, and it thrived by filling a void of conservative media coverage.\nCNN had the ability to be on the ground, reporting. But its commentary felt forced. Its strength was in news.\nWhile Fox News's actual reporting, according to Mike Hoyt, a former editor of Columbia Journalism Review, was \"a small island in a vast sea of very conservative commentary.\"\nIn February 2010, Fox amped up the feud when it lashed out at CNN's claim that said it was the most trusted name in news.\nA poll conducted by the independent survey firm Public Policy Polling found Fox News was trusted by more than 50%, while CNN was sitting on 39%.\nFox News ran a full-page ad in The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, which said \"The Most Trusted Name In News,\" taunting CNN.\nThat was CNN's worst month in its recent history.\nThe network finished well behind Fox News and MSNBC. The slump continued into March. Its anchors weren't doing well. In particular, Larry King, a 25-year stalwart, had lost almost half of his viewers in a year.\nHe was failing to compete with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow and Fox News' Sean Hannity. But management said nothing would change.\nIn May 2012, CNN reported its worst ratings in a decade.\nJoe Coscarelli wrote for the New York Magazine, \"CNN may have been the original cable network, but it's simply not up to date with a time when news breaks mostly online and talking heads are for reinforcing already ingrained belief systems.\nTime Warner chief executive Jeffrey Bewkes finally called for changes. But one unnamed employee, echoing a common sentiment within the company, told The New York Times, \"I can't figure out what the master plan is.\"\nCNN's inability to compete was summed up Fox News' Tamara Holder.\nShe told the Columbia Journalism Review that while CNN star anchor Anderson Cooper was a good reporter, he was boring.\n\"Would you watch an old guy talk rationally about a topic? Bet you'd rather watch two hot chicks who are smart and who disagree yell at each other,\" she said\nHolder was referring to a segment fought on Fox News for seven minutes, between liberal journalist Kirsten Powers and anchor Megyn Kelly, over alleged voter intimidation.\nIt ended up simply being a fight to be heard, not to convince anyone of a point of view. It was also seen as the point where Kelly's career bloomed at Fox News.\nIn mid-2012, CNN was experiencing one of its worst slumps ever.\nScott Collins wrote for the Los Angeles Times that the network was in a \"seemingly unstoppable downward spiral.\"\nNews anchor Wolf Blitzer told Collins he thought people would come back to watch during the presidential election. But it wasn't enough. Although CNN finished 2012 with 670,000 viewers, an increase from its 2010 low of 564,000 viewers, it still wasn't enough.\nFox News continued to rise. It finished 2012 with an average of 2 million prime-time viewers.\nIn 2008, Former Fox News vice president Bill Shine said that if Barack Obama became president, Fox News would become the voice of the opposition.\nAnd that's the route it took. Barack Obama's reelection and the political climate helped Fox News grow.\nIn January 2013, the former head of NBC Universal, Jeff Zucker, became president of CNN Worldwide. It's hard to miss the irony.\nZucker ran MSNBC, which became something of a left-wing alternative to Fox News's programming, albeit with a much smaller audience.\nThe polarization was a key reason why CNN, lodged in the middle, was getting drowned out.\nBut according to Cooper, Zucker was \"the first president to actually watch CNN.\"\nSource: New York Magazine\nZucker wanted to revamp CNN from a tired news station into something entertaining.\nHe wanted to unshackle the network from \"war, famine, pestilence, and politics,\" then-CNN anchor Piers Morgan told Politico.\nHe wanted to break up CNN's daytime programming, which ran together as an endless breaking news cycle.\nOne of his first changes was to cancel a struggling morning show and bringing on Chris Cuomo, a brash young anchor and the younger brother of New York governor's, Andrew Cuomo. He also hired Washington correspondent and anchor Jake Tapper.\nIt was Zucker who brought back the tagline \"this is CNN\" as he tried to strengthen the network's identity.\nSources: New York Magazine, AP\nHe wasn't afraid to break from the brand, either.\nZucker got rid of some of CNN's 9 p.m. talk shows to make space for a series of non-fiction shows. He wanted to replicate the success of a weekly travel program CNN aired, which was hosted by celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain.\nKate Bolden, a CNN host told AP, \"There was a real sense of energy when Jeff came in \u2014 a new energy, a resurrection.\"\nThings were changing for Fox News in 2013, too.\nThe network had its first lineup overhaul since 2002, beginning with Megyn Kelly debuting her show \"The Kelly File.\" The changes were seen as Fox News softening its commentary-driven programming. Kelly was put in Sean Hannity's 9 p.m. slot, and Shepard was moved to a 3 p.m. show and made chief news anchor.\nOne of the reasons for this change was that Ailes was concerned about its aging demographic.\nHe was banking on Kelly becoming a member of the next generation of Fox News anchors. But not everyone agreed, and conservatives were worried Fox News was becoming too moderate.\nIn 2014, commentators noticed Fox News was also putting more left-wing analysts on air.\nPeople like attorney Tamara Holder and former Bill Clinton strategist James Carville were frequent guests. But since they were always outnumbered, it looked like Fox News simply wanted to create fireworks on air rather than push a more diverse array of opinions.\nAnother sign was former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's fall from favor.\nIn 2013, she got a sizable pay-cut, going from $1 million a year between 2009 and 2012, to $250,000 a year.\nThen, in 2015, her contract wasn't renewed.\nThere were a few reasons why Fox News dropped Palin. She was no longer as popular as she had been, but also the political climate had changed. It was a sign that the network was edging a little closer to the center.\nPalin went on to start her own media organization.\nIn 2014, Palin started \"The Sarah Palin channel.\" Her aim was to provide a direct link between her and her supporters, with \"no need to please the powers-that-be,\" NBC News reported.\nPalin wasn't the only one trying to create a substitute to Fox News. Nor was she the first. A variety of alternatives were entering the right-wing media space, including Blaze, launched by former Fox News host Glen Beck, One America News Network which was launched in in 2013, as well as Breitbart News, and CRTV.\nBut none of these alternatives were big enough to pose a feasible threat to Fox News. While other mainstream alternatives were reluctant to take the network on, because entering the competition was expensive. No other company in the industry had the same resources as Rupert Murdoch's empire.\nAnother possible reason was that public companies didn't want the controversy of producing conservative news.\nAcross the divide, despite Zucker's changes, CNN's viewers were down to 515,000 in the primetime slot in 2014. Even if it was sitting higher than MSNBC it was even less than its 2010 low of 564,000.\nAccording to Mediaite, CNN's ratings were lower than ever before.\nAlthough, one story the network really honed in on was the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. CNN's coverage even briefly pushed it past Fox News for a few hours. But CNN was also criticized for exploiting the story, especially anchor Don Lemon's use of a toy plane to illustrate a point.\nIn 2015, CNN's news judgment was mocked for choosing to cover the White House Correspondent's dinner over protests for Freddie Gray, a black man who died while being held by police.\nIt was also \u2014 and not for the last time \u2014 criticized for giving so much attention to then-Republican candidate Donald Trump.\nIn 2015, Fox News saw a glimmer of the future when Megyn Kelly grilled Trump over his past sexist comments. Trump responded by refusing to go back on Fox News.\nHe showed how much power he had over the network when he refused to give in.\nAiles was forced to side with Trump over Kelly, and Ailes had to call him and apologize.\nFox News' management also reportedly killed a story about Trump's alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels, because Murdoch wanted Trump to win.\nThe story of the alleged affair was later broken by the Wall Street Journal, another part of Murdoch's media empire.\nThen in 2016, Trump was elected president.\nIt was a tectonic moment for both networks.\nFor CNN, it spurred soul-searching about the network's wall-to-wall coverage of the president and whether it excluded certain political voices.\nFor Fox News, it meant the network's audience \u2014 and conservative base \u2014 would be tethered to Trump for at least four more years.\nFor CNN, Trump provided a focus for all of its breaking news talent.\nAlthough Trump refused to give CNN an interview, denouncing it as \"fake news,\" 2016 was CNN's most profitable year ever. Its daytime audience rose by 50%, and its prime-time audience by 70%.\nYet CNN was heavily criticized for being one of the first major news outlets to give Trump a platform.\nAfter he won, Zucker apologized for airing so many of his rallies in the lead up to the election.\n\"We're not pro-Trump and we're not anti-Trump \u2014 we're pro-truth,\" he said to the Los Angeles Times. \"And I understand that pro-truth in this day and age can come off as anti-Trump.\"\nFor Fox, it started as a mutually-beneficial relationship.\nFor the first two years of Trump's term, the network amplified his presidency. And Trump tweeted out Fox's coverage, creating a feedback loop that saturated right-wing media.\nTrump publicly talked about how often he watched Fox News, and he was happy to appear on it. By March 2019, he had appeared on Fox News 44 times.\nFox News and Trump seemed to be intertwined, and any claim that it wasn't \"mainstream media\" was hard to swallow, considering its popularity and its positioning close to the president.\nGoing into the election, 19% of American voters called Fox News their primary news source, according to Pew Research. CNN was second, at 8%.\nAnd after the election, in 2017, the White House briefing room placed Fox News' correspondent in the front row, sitting between CBS News and NBC News, which makes it difficult hard to argue that it wasn't mainstream.\nNicole Hemmer, an assistant professor of Presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, told The New Yorker it was the closest America has come to having state TV.\nWhile Jane Mayer, who wrote The New Yorker piece, showed in an investigation that while it wasn't state television, Fox News was increasingly pulling Trump challengers from the airwaves.\nThe comparison wasn't helped with anchor Sean Hannity. At one point, he was reportedly speaking to Trump every night, keeping communications open, and their connection close. Hannity also speak on his behalf at a campaign rally, and the Washington Post called Hannity \"the deputy chief of staff.\"\nThe changes were made even starker with the departure of Ailes.\nAiles was forced to step down in 2016, due to allegations of long-term sexual harassment. He'd long been the target for Fox News' dissenters. But with him gone, there seemed to be a void of direction, which Trump coverage filled.\nFormer Fox News contributor Bill Kristol told The New Yorker the network had become more propagandistic.\n\"Before, it was conservative, but it wasn't crazy. Now it's just propaganda,\" he said. While The Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin said, \"It's simply a mouthpiece for the President, repeating what the President says, no matter how false or contradictory.\"\nThings continued to change for Fox News in 2017. Megan Kelly and Bill O'Reilly were out of the network.\nIn January 2017, Megyn Kelly, Ailes' hope for the future of Fox News, moved to NBC.\nA few months later, Bill O'Reilly was forced out, after it was made public the network had spent $13 million to settle sexual misconduct claims made against him.\nA revolving door between Trump's administration and Fox News became more and more pronounced.\nMore than twenty people have gone between Trump's administration and Fox Corporation, the company that oversees Fox News, Business Insider's Grace Panetta reported.\nThe list includes White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, communications director Hope Hicks, and former ICE Director Thomas Homan.\nOne key figure who helped keep the revolving door spinning was former Fox News executive Bill Shine, who was Trump's director of communications for eight months.\nShine was Roger Ailes' deputy or protege, and used to be Hannity's producer, before working his way up.\nMayer said Hannity had put Shine in the White House, after introducing the pair, arranging a dinner, and pushing for it to happen. \"So Sean Hannity has managed to get his best friend, a former president of Fox News, in the position that's incredibly useful to reporters, which is director of communication.\"\nThe list of people who went from Fox News to the White House included, Heather Nauret who went from anchoring \"Fox & Friends,\" to the Trump administration. John Bolton, a long-time contributor to Fox News, before becoming Trump's National Security Advisor.\nThere's also Anthony Scaramucci, who lasted 10 days as White House communications director, after working as a Fox Business analyst.\nAcross the way, CNN was hiring more Trump supporters to defend Trump's views.\nThe network was trying to provide political diversity or \"villains\" to parry with its \"heroes.\" But it often backfired.\nCNN's had to fire multiple Trump-friendly commentators after they said or did controversial things. In 2017, Jeffrey Lord was fired for tweeting \"Sieg Heil.\" Ed Martin, a Trump-supporting talk show host, was fired for calling other CNN contributors \"black racists,\" and \"rabid feminists.\"\nAccording to Politico, what made the job so difficult to keep was that the position, \"must be filled by somebody close to the president who is willing to repeat, amplify and explain the racist, insulting, inflammatory and conspiratorial things the president says on a daily basis.\"\nIn 2017, the networks clashed when Fox News distorted comments made by CNN host Jake Tapper.\nAfter a terror attack in New York where the attacker reportedly yelled out \"Allahu akbar,\" Tapper said the phrase could be \"beautiful.\"\nFox's website called Tapper's comment \"outrageous,\" even as Tapper pointed out that the phrase is used on occasions like weddings.\nTapper didn't refrain from hitting back at Fox News. He said the network was following the \"slime-coated path\" of outlets like Infowars.\nThis clash between networks was becoming intense.\nAccording to The Washington Post, the two networks were attacking each other, turning its competitor's mistakes, ratings, and missteps into news stories, which while not unheard of, was reaching a new intensity in the Trump era. It was a sign of how polarized the two networks' had become.\nThese clashes showed that CNN was no longer defining itself by sitting in the middle of the political spectrum.\nUniversity of Southern California's Annenberg School of Communication's professor Gabriel Kahn told The Washington Post CNN was defining its audience by saying what it was not. Unlike Fox News, CNN wanted to make sure it wasn't seen as a partisan media outlet.\nFox News didn't just attack CNN. It effectively attacked all media that didn't have a right-wing bias.\nAs Kelefa Sanneh wrote for The New Yorker, \"By criticizing the 'liberal' media, Fox News set the bait; any outlet that tried to rebut this criticism was, in a twisted way, corroborating it.\"\nAnd in doing this \u2014 despite losing Ailes, Kelly, and O'Reilly \u2014 Fox News continued to thrive.\nIn 2018, the network was bringing in about 2.4 million primetime viewers every night.\nAnchors like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity led the way, stirring the pot. Hannity often called CNN \"fake news\" and said it suffered from TDS, which stands for Trump Derangement Syndrome.\nBut in 2019, Trump's relationship with Fox News began to sour.\nThe network was having what Vanity Fair called a \"Trump identity crisis,\" with the president beginning to tweet that it was time to find a new news outlet because Fox News wasn't working for \"us\" anymore, in reference to a Fox poll that said 51% of viewers wanted him impeached.\nInstead, he was reportedly looking at smaller, more radical sites, like Brietbart and One America News Network.\nEven Carlson, a stalwart Trump supporter, criticized Trump for pressuring Ukraine's president to interfere in the 2020 elections.\nAn opinion piece he wrote, began, \"Donald Trump should not have been on the phone with a foreign head of state encouraging another country to investigate his political opponent, Joe Biden. Some Republicans are trying, but there's no way to spin this as a good idea.\"\nIn October 2019, Shepard Smith resigned, and the network's news focus seemed even more precarious.\nOn his last broadcast, Smith didn't explain where he'd be headed next but said he planned to focus on spending time with family and friends. In a statement, Smith thanked his colleagues and said he would \"miss\" working at Fox News.\nAccording to those inside the network, his departure was because he was sick of being attacked by Trump and his colleagues since he refused to bend to the whims of the president.\nWith Smith gone, critics said, Fox News' ability to argue that it produced unbiased coverage, alongside its opinion shows, was substantially weakened. One Fox News staffer told The Daily Beast, \"There's no room for news here anymore.\"\nChanges at CNN had become more noticeable, too.\nIn 2019, Emily Tamkin wrote for Columbia Journalism Review, \"It's just that what is mostly reflected on the screen\u2014especially during prime time\u2014seems to be less news reporting, more punditry, more round tables, more horse-race politics, more talking heads, more interviews and interviewees yelling at each other, more that makes the news more confusing for the viewer (or at least for this viewer).\"\nBy October 2019, CNN had settled into third place for viewers, falling behind Fox News and MSNBC for the 10th quarter in a row.\nIt hadn't found a way to beat Fox News.\nEven so, going forward, it won't be picking up viewers by repeating its 2016 presidential coverage in 2020.\nAccording to Zucker, this time it won't be airing any live and uncut political rallies.\nCNN also put on 20 of its own events to debate issues.\nThat way, the network could spread around coverage between the candidates and wouldn't seem like it supported a particular one.\nAfter 2020, Zucker told the Washington Post, he wanted CNN \"to be a big and important part of the conversation.\"\n\"I want us to make sure that we're telling the full and complete story so that no one wakes up the day after the election and is surprised by whatever happens,\" he said.\nWhile for Fox News, Lachlan Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch's son and Fox Corp's CEO, is reportedly already looking at a future after Trump.\nBut since the network is bringing in $2.7 billion a year, and has the best ratings in cable news, it's unlikely much will change right away."
