  "summary": "The tech layoff wave continues in 2025, with over 150,000 job cuts across 549 companies, according to independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. So far this year, more than 22,000 workers have been laid off across the tech industry, with 16,084 job cuts in February alone. The company that operates the popular digital wallet MetaMask plans to continue hiring for select roles and is shutting down operations. Peloton CEO Peter Stern said the cuts are needed to improve long-term business health. The Israeli-founded unicorn is cutting about 200 employees, roughly 34% of its global workforce, as it shuts down its email and SMS marketing operations. Amazon is reorganizing its audio operations, moving Wondery\u2019s audio-only podcasts under Audible and placing video-focused shows into a new Creator Services division.",
  "shortSummary": "In 2025, the tech industry faces a wave of job cuts, particularly in tech-centric areas like Amazon, Microsoft, and Twitter.",

      "text": "Women\u2019s health company HerMD, which specializes in menopause and sexual healthcare, has announced it will close all locations effective March 21, 2025. The news comes after the company secured $18 million in additional Series A funding to fuel expansion plans in 2023.\nIn an email sent to patients on February 24, the HerMD leadership team cited \u201congoing challenges in healthcare\u201d that made it \u201cincreasingly difficult to sustain the quality care we provide and that we know our patients truly deserve.\u201d The company reported having served more than 25,000 patients across multiple states during its operation.\nFounded by Dr. Somi Javaid in 2015, HerMD began with a single clinic in Cincinnati before expanding to multiple locations across Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, and New Jersey. The company distinguished itself by offering longer appointment times (20-60 minutes) and comprehensive women\u2019s healthcare services focused on menopause and sexual health\u2014areas where traditional healthcare often falls short.\nThe closure announcement represents a significant setback for women\u2019s health services, particularly considering HerMD\u2019s ambitious growth trajectory. In July 2023, when announcing its $18 million funding extension led by JAZZ Venture Partners with participation from Amboy Street Ventures and B-Flexion, the company outlined plans to expand to over 200 clinics, including locations in New York City and Nashville.\nThat funding round had brought HerMD\u2019s total investment to approximately $30 million, with the capital earmarked for brick-and-mortar expansion, development of virtual services, enhancement of provider training through HerMD University, and investment in technologies for sexual health and menopause care.\nHerMD\u2019s business model addressed several barriers to quality women\u2019s healthcare, including stigma around sexual health, rushed appointments, and limited insurance coverage for innovative treatments. Unlike many boutique practices, HerMD accepted insurance and Medicare, making specialized care more accessible.\nThe company also focused on provider education through its HerMD University program, addressing the statistic that less than 20% of OBGYNs are trained in menopause and sexual health care.\nHerMD has notified patients that they will assist with medical records transfers and provided contact information for questions before and after the March 21 closure date. The company did not specify which particular healthcare challenges led to the shutdown."

      "text": "Data-labeling startup Scale AI is laying off 200 employees, roughly 14% of its staff, and cutting ties with 500 of its global contractors, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. The cuts come just a month after Meta hired Scale AI\u2019s CEO in a $14.3 billion deal.\nIn a memo obtained by Bloomberg, interim CEO Jason Droege told staff that Scale AI had too quickly scaled its core data-labeling business \u2014 in which the startup supplied AI labs with labeled, structured data to train AI models. Droege said in the memo that Scale AI would staff up around its enterprise and government sales units.\nLike other AI startups that have been reverse acqui-hired, such as Inflection, it seems that Scale AI now has to pivot from the business that put it on the map. In light of Meta\u2019s investment, several of Scale AI\u2019s largest data customers cut ties with the startup."

      "text": "We are sharing the message we shared with our team today. The only change is a small redaction on proprietary projects in development.\nAll,\nI have some sad news. Today, I made the difficult decision to reduce the size of our team by 16%. That means parting ways with many friends and colleagues. These are great and very talented people and this is no reflection on them or their work. This wasn\u2019t an easy decision, but ultimately it\u2019s one we had to make for the long term success of Rec Room.\nRec Room\u2019s grown far beyond what I could have imagined over the past 9 years. The credit for that success goes to the teams who built things others often thought were impossible, but this decision, the company\u2019s position and our long term direction are my responsibility.\nRec Room is not just a video game. It\u2019s a place where millions of people make new friends, express their creativity, and find fun each month. It\u2019s a community that\u2019s larger than many countries. It\u2019s a place where people were able to fight loneliness and isolation during some of the hardest times we\u2019ve seen. Ensuring Rec Room can thrive for years to come is a heavy responsibility, and sometimes living up to that responsibility requires making difficult decisions.\nI\u2019ve always tried to be transparent with all of you on what\u2019s happening across the business in good times and bad, so I\u2019d like to outline what we\u2019re doing for the people who are impacted, why I believe this is necessary now and our plans for the future.\nHow are we helping people who are impacted?\nWe\u2019re grateful to the people who have worked hard to build Rec Room into what it is. These people have been our friends and colleagues for many years. We recognize this will be a difficult transition for them, but we want to ensure we\u2019re giving them all of the resources we can to help them with whatever is next for them.\nWe have spoken to all of them directly this morning and we will be providing them with 3 months of paid severance and 6 months of healthcare premiums. They\u2019ll also receive access to outplacement support including 1:1 assistance with resume writing, cover letter drafting, career coaching, and job interview prep. This will ensure they have the time and the resources to find what\u2019s next.\nMany of you have asked if you can reach out and offer support. Yes, you absolutely can. Still, be aware this is a difficult time for them, and they may need some additional time and space.\nHow did we get here?\nThe market has changed dramatically from where it was in the earlier part of the decade. Gaming market growth has slowed, while higher interest rates and a more challenging fundraising environment make cash harder to come by. As a result, we have to change the way we think about Rec Room\u2019s financial strategy.\nIn good times, startups look to raise funding every 18 to 24 months and that\u2019s what we did in the early years. In challenging times, the advice was generally to budget for 3+ years of runway. When we last raised money, we budgeted for 5+ years because the economic outlook seemed uncertain for late stage private companies. It remains uncertain three years later. Our current assumption is that we need to become self-sustaining using our current cash and not plan on any future fundraises. We need to control our own destiny by bringing in more money than we spend.\nLayoffs are a last resort, and we took as many preventative actions as we could before reducing our team size. Rather than hire externally, we re-trained individuals into new disciplines. We cut UA spending. We reduced third party spending by taking some key systems in-house. We made large reductions to our infrastructure spending which made it much more efficient to run the Rec Room service. We also launched Rec Room onto Nintendo Switch, the game console with the widest install base in existence.\nThese changes all improved our financial position, but as our largest spend each month goes to people and payroll, they weren\u2019t enough on their own.\nWhat have we learned and how do we change moving forward?\nThis is a tough day and we don\u2019t want to do this again. I\u2019ve learned a lot in this process and I\u2019m going to make sure I fix as much as I can based on those learnings. No one can predict the future, but we can learn and improve so we\u2019re better prepared for whatever the future throws at us.\nI\u2019ve had conversations with many of you about the changes you believe are needed. One clear theme came forward. We all want to move at startup speed, but the organization and our process is getting in the way.\nWe need to look and feel like a startup again. We need to get back to our roots. We\u2019ve taken missteps over the past few years that have pulled us away from our startup process, and we need to fix them now:\nFlatter Organization\nAs Rec Room the product grew, so too did the organizational structure. There are too many people splitting time between IC work and management. This hybrid role creates too many negatives and not enough positives. It creates more layers of management, a wider group of \u201cleads\u201d that need to buy off on all decisions, and it means fewer IC hours. It\u2019s making us slower and less effective.\nMoving forward, we\u2019re going to create a stronger separation from the IC and the manager role. Be a great IC or be a great manager. Don\u2019t try to be both.\nThis will result in a flatter org with fewer managers, faster decisions and more time for ICs to dedicate toward building product.\nSmaller Cross-Functional Teams\nFor the past few years, we\u2019ve been organizing across disciplines or functions (horizontally). This has some advantages, but it requires more communication, process and managers to coordinate. This is how a big company organizes to reduce duplication of effort and consistency in process. It is not how you organize for speed, and it is slowing us down.\nMoving forward, we\u2019re redrawing our organizational structure to be both flatter and more interdisciplinary (vertical). Teams will be smaller and will contain devs, designers, artists. They\u2019ll be able to operate more autonomously. This is what the early years of Rec Room looked like.\nScrappier & More Efficient\nToo often, we\u2019ve been trying to solve problems by spending our way out. When confronted with an obstacle, often our first instinct was to buy software to solve it, scale up rather than optimize or hire more people to workaround it.\nFor the past few months, as we\u2019ve focused more on costs, we\u2019ve shifted back to our scrappier roots. When we\u2019ve taken the scrappier approach, we built better internal tools than anything we could buy. We were forced to optimize our systems making them better and more resilient. And we\u2019ve spent time simplifying and automating our processes rather than throwing people hours at an unoptimized workflow.\nWhen we create the right conditions, the resourcefulness and inventiveness of our team is incredibly strong. Let's lean into that.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nWe have a very unique product. Rec Room spans 10 platforms from phones to consoles to headsets. It has millions of games where you can shoot, fish, race, roleplay, hangout, take care of monsters, battle a clown or pass a ticking bomb back and forth. Those games are built and enjoyed by millions of players across more than 150 countries each month.\nBut Rec Room\u2019s been an underdog from the start.\nGaming startups don\u2019t work. There\u2019s no market for VR. You can\u2019t port that game to consoles. Phones? Forget it, it\u2019ll never run. UGC gaming is a fad. In-game creation tools will never be powerful enough to build \u201cgood\u201d games.\nWe\u2019re still an underdog now. In the past we overcame underdog odds, by staying focused on what matters.\nNow is the time to focus on a smaller number of high priority areas that let us expand who can create, what they can create, and how that drives our business forward\nEnsuring Everyone Can Create = ************** and ***** ** will dramatically expand who can create. They\u2019re simple enough for anyone to use. They\u2019re fast and varied enough to make building fun, and powerful enough to get complex outcomes, worlds and gameplay.\nRooms 2.0 = This is the largest bet we've made as a company. Rooms 2.0 is what gets us to bigger, more complex, more reliable rooms that run everywhere. It sets us up for breakthroughs on everything from load times to circuits.\nRec Room Plus = This is the financial engine of the company. Plus subscribers are by far our most engaged players and creators. We need to put more value into the subscription and do a better job of explaining that value so that subscribing is a no-brainer for any serious Rec Room player.\nWe need to get back to our startup roots and stay focused on what matters.\nFor all of you here, I know this is one of the toughest days we\u2019ve had as a company. It will take time for us to regroup and reorganize. The future is always uncertain, but we made these difficult decisions to ensure the Rec Room is in a stronger position moving forward.\nThank you all for your help in building Rec Room into a place where anyone can create games and come together regardless of their age, technical knowledge, financial resources, or geographic location. Let's continue to build.\nNick"

      "text": "Redfin to cut 450 roles following Zillow rentals deal\nThe company, which signed an exclusive listings partnership with Zillow on Feb. 11, will complete the layoffs in July as it restructures its rentals segment.\nWhile a new listings partnership between Redfin and Zillow is expected to benefit both companies in the long run, it comes at a cost for some Redfin employees.\nIn an SEC filing ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings report, Redfin announced plans to restructure its rentals segment \u2014 a move that will \"eliminate certain employee roles\" that support the rentals division. An estimated 450 positions will be cut between February and July 2025, and the restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of September.\nWhy now? The news follows the Feb. 11 announcement of a rentals-focused partnership agreement between Zillow and Redfin. According to a news release, Zillow \u2014 which reported 25% annual growth in its rentals business in the fourth quarter of 2024 \u2014 will become the exclusive provider of multifamily rental listings on Redfin and its owned rental sites, Rent.com and ApartmentGuide.com.\nRedfin CEO Glenn Kelman said the agreement will allow his company to focus on other aspects of its business, including lending and title services, while giving \"Redfin visitors access to one of the largest and fastest-growing databases of rental listings.\"\nZillow is paying Redfin $100 million to secure the exclusive agreement, while Redfin estimates it will incur between $18 million and $21 million in expenses to restructure its rentals segment.\nReal Estate News reached out to Redfin for further details about the restructuring and layoffs and was told the company had no additional information to share.\nFinancial outlook: Redfin's fourth quarter earnings release is scheduled for Thursday, Feb. 27 after the stock market closes. During its last earnings call, the company reported a small increase in revenue year-over-year, but also posted significant losses which it attributed to the expansion of its Redfin Next agent pay plan.\nKelman said at the time that the program will ultimately strengthen the company's sales force, providing a competitive advantage when the market improves, but he also apologized to shareholders for failing to make a profit last year. The rentals partnership announcement appears to have pleased investors, however, as Redfin stock was up more than 11% on Feb. 12.\nA series of layoffs: This marks the third \u2014 and largest \u2014 round of layoffs at Redfin in seven months following other targeted cuts in January and August.\nLast month, 46 employees working primarily in managerial roles were let go, according to a statement provided to GeekWire. The August layoffs involved positions in the company's Concierge service, with fewer than 100 people impacted."

Klue co-founder and CEO Jason Smith told BetaKit that the startup proactively made these cuts to increase efficiency and hasten a path to profitability amid increasing uncertainty as to what companies are willing to pay for versus building themselves in the age of AI.\n\u201cThere is ambiguity about what people will pay for.\u201d\nJason Smith\nKlue CEO\nThe restructuring took place June 25 and included layoffs and voluntary departures, impacting approximately 85 of the startup\u2019s employees across teams and locations, Smith said. He noted that AI, both as an external competitor and an internal replacement for some of the work done by staff, was \u201cthe common thread\u201d necessitating the decision, adding that Klue hopes to become \u201cAI-first operationally\u201d through this reorganization.\n\u201cA layoff of this magnitude acts as a kind of forcing function for us as a company\u2014to find efficiencies, one has to look to AI apps and agents,\u201d Smith said over email. As part of this restructuring, Klue is also consolidating its engineering operations in Canada and reducing its compute spending.\nKlue informed employees of the impending layoffs on June 13, offering them the opportunity to leave voluntarily for the same severance package. Smith said Klue also held one-on-ones and other sessions for staff leading up to June 25. The Globe and Mail first reported Klue\u2019s staff reduction plans.\nThe CEO said Klue is providing everyone impacted by these layoffs with \u201cgenerous severance packages, extended benefits, and support for their transition,\u201d noting that \u201cevery individual affected has contributed meaningfully to building Klue.\u201d\nThe ChatGPT effect\nA frequently asked question (FAQ) document Klue shared with staff in the lead-up to the layoffs and viewed by BetaKit indicated that the startup had failed to reach its topline revenue growth targets while seeing increasing customer churn this year. The FAQ noted that Klue has been facing difficulty competing against OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT offering.\nThe FAQ stated specifically that Klue has been \u201closing more deals to ChatGPT (AI-disruption),\u201d and is building a new product to address this and help the company \u201cre-find product-market fit\u2014with AI at the core.\u201d\nThe document also said that Klue has burned $28 million since 2023 to grow $2.5 million, and that the startup would run out of cash in two years if it were to continue at its current rate and team size without layoffs. BetaKit has not confirmed the accuracy of the burn and revenue growth rate numbers originally included in the FAQ.\nRELATED: Klue scores $79 million CAD from Tiger Global, Salesforce Ventures\nOne source familiar with the company\u2019s operations confirmed to BetaKit that the burn and revenue growth numbers were subsequently removed from the document after it was shared with employees. In an interview with BetaKit, Smith disputed some of the information obtained by BetaKit, including information related to the company\u2019s financial health.\nSmith told BetaKit that the burn and revenue growth figures contained in the FAQ are inaccurate, claiming that someone had \u201cmixed up burn with projected future spend.\u201d He asserted that Klue has generated more than $25 million CAD in new and expansion revenue on top of its existing recurring base since 2023.\nSmith also claimed that the FAQ\u2019s assertion of a two-year runway was \u201cpatently false,\u201d adding he had \u201cno idea where that\u2019s coming from.\u201d He believed a five-year estimate would be \u201cmore appropriate.\u201d\nKlue raised nearly $80 million CAD in Series B funding from Tiger Global and Salesforce Ventures in 2021, bringing its total funding to more than $100 million CAD. Smith maintained that Klue still has $50 million CAD in the bank today.\n\u201cWe are well-funded, spend judiciously and strategically, and never have to raise outside capital again,\u201d he said.\nThe CEO declined to disclose Klue\u2019s exact sales, but did indicate that Klue is currently generating somewhere between $25 million and $50 million CAD in annual revenue.\n\u201c[Klue] was screaming product-market fit in the early days \u2026 and then AI comes along with internal experimentation, and there\u2019s a higher bar for what quality looks like,\u201d Smith told BetaKit. \u201cWe as a company are just looking at that realistically, and saying we need to maintain an even higher bar than what you can get out of the box by throwing your regular data into it.\u201d\nSmith acknowledged that ChatGPT is powerful, and said Klue uses OpenAI\u2019s latest models and others in its own Compete AI product. But the CEO argued that seasoned sellers and others with specific expertise often find ChatGPT\u2019s answers \u201clacking nuance and concrete outputs.\u201d\nHe denied that Klue has been losing deals to OpenAI, but did say Klue has faced increased competition from companies creating their own AI solutions. Today, Smith said many businesses are evaluating their paid subscriptions to products like Klue and experimenting with developing internal AI agents to do the same work. He claimed this trend has slowed deal cycles across the software industry.\nMany of these large-language models (LLMs) and agent-building products are inexpensive or even free to try. At the moment, Smith said, \u201cThere is ambiguity about what people will pay for.\u201d\nRELATED: At Homecoming, Shopify\u2019s Tobi L\u00fctke says his company is embracing AI to prevent stagnation\nSmith expects the tech world to go through a \u201cclunky phase\u201d where companies spin up thousands of their own agents before deciding which ones to build versus buy.\n\u201cWe think quality will rise to the top, but we will go through two years of thrashing, which is why I\u2019m cautious on the spend,\u201d he said.\nContrary to the FAQ, Smith also claimed that Klue hit its first-quarter targets without increasing churn. However, he said the startup is \u201cuncertain\u201d about what the rest of 2025 will look like as more companies experiment with AI. \u201cWe actually expected to grow significantly faster than 2024, and now we think we\u2019ll grow at a similar pace\u201d with low double-digit growth, Smith said.\nSmith confirmed that the staff reduction would help Klue become profitable by Q4 of this year, granting it the flexibility to wait out any further economic headwinds as it reorients for the era of AI and builds \u201cKlue 2.0.\u201d He noted that Klue decided to make deep cuts now instead of dragging things out over a series of smaller layoffs, and said he expects this restructuring to give Klue more options in the future, including a greater capacity to make acquisitions.\nDespite this market uncertainty, Smith said Klue has \u201cnever had more conviction\u201d in its roadmap and continues to see rising demand, leads, and opportunities for its products.\n\u201cWe are still larger and have more capital than any of our competitors, and will continue to invest in AI and our refounded team,\u201d Smith told BetaKit.\nCompeting in the \u201cAI-first era\u201d\nSmith claimed that Klue differed from other tech startups in 2023 by refraining from layoffs, instead investing aggressively in AI for its product. This came despite increased churn and single-digit growth that year amid a market downturn. He said Klue has also been leveraging AI to improve its internal operations, and that these efforts have already saved employees a great deal of time completing tedious tasks.\nSmith envisions a \u201csmaller, nimbler\u201d Klue.\nSmith still noted that AI has become a \u201cthreat\u201d on both the product and operational sides, highlighting that many younger startups today are growing with far fewer employees thanks to AI.\n\u201cIt\u2019s imperative for companies like Klue, founded before GPT-3 and agent possibilities, to rejig operational structures and approaches to compete in the AI-first era.\u201d\nPost-layoffs, the CEO envisions a \u201csmaller, nimbler\u201d Klue with engineering and go-to-market teams that leverage AI tools to operate more efficiently and ship products faster.\nRecent data from Statistics Canada suggests that increased business AI adoption has had a limited effect on corporate headcounts in Canada. However, data from Carta indicates that the rise of AI has coincided with a decline in the size of tech startup teams.\nGoing forward, Smith said he wants Klue staff to consider whether AI agents could complete enough of a given role\u2019s work before hiring someone to fill it. He likened his approach to that of Shopify co-founder and CEO Tobi L\u00fctke, whose recent memo told employees to prove AI cannot do a job before asking for additional resources or staff.\nRELATED: OpenText makes AI \u201cnumber-one priority\u201d as company slashes 1,600 jobs\nAs BetaKit first reported, fellow Canadian tech company OpenText recently cut 1,600 jobs while making internal AI use a \u201cbaseline expectation.\u201d South of the border, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told employees that AI will reduce its headcount.\nOn the product front, Smith said Klue is betting its more focused AI tools will help clients win deals more reliably than either do-it-yourself solutions, baseline ChatGPT, or generalized options.\n\u201cI think narrow wins,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything wide, anything that\u2019s trying to compete with just the basic LLM, will get crushed. But if you can provide additional data, additional full workflow wrappers and program impact and sophisticated prompting \u2026 You will have a better quality output, and companies will always pay for quality.\u201d\nFeature image courtesy Klue.\nUpdated (08/18/25): This story has been updated with additional information related to Klue\u2019s FAQ document and commentary from Klue."

      "text": "Eigen Labs has announced the launch of EigenCloud, a platform designed to extend blockchain-grade trust guarantees to any Web2 or Web3 application.\nThe alpha version launch this week coincides with a fresh $70 million token purchase by a16z crypto, deepening its commitment following the firm\u2019s $100 million Series B investment in February 2024.\nThe venture firm\u2019s direct purchase of EIGEN tokens indicates alignment with EigenLayer\u2019s token-centric economic model as EigenCloud usage will create new fee flows that can support staking rewards.\nThe structure introduces a potential yield incentive for restakers, creating a feedback loop between application usage and network participation.\nTurning Ethereum Restaking Into A Programmable Trust Layer\nEigenCloud is built atop EigenLayer\u2019s restaking protocol and integrates data availability (EigenDA), general-purpose compute (EigenCompute), and dispute resolution (EigenVerify) into a single developer-facing platform.\nThese tools allow developers to cryptographically prove what happened off-chain, with the same trust guarantees traditionally reserved for on-chain activity.\nRestaking has emerged as a popular model for bootstrapping decentralized infrastructure. EigenLayer allows Ethereum stakers to \u201crestake\u201d their ETH to secure third-party services, known as autonomous verifiable services.\nOver $12 billion in restaked assets are securing more than 200 AVSs across oracles, rollups, AI workflows, and decentralized middleware.\nEigen Labs Milestones And Performance Benchmarks\nEigenCloud\u2019s alpha rollout aligns with a performance upgrade for EigenDA, achieving throughput of 50 MB per second on Ethereum testnets. It also launches a gated preview of EigenVerify, designed to adjudicate disputes in off-chain systems like AI agents or prediction markets.\nLater this year, EigenCompute will provide verifiable general-purpose compute, enabling developers to anchor computation results with cryptoeconomic guarantees.\nThe April activation of slashing marked a key step for EigenLayer, empowering AVSs to penalize misbehaving node operators. This capability allows EigenCloud to extend L1-like guarantees beyond traditional blockchains into areas like medical records, machine learning inference, and Web2 marketplaces, domains where trust and correctness are paramount.\nA Eigen Labs Crypto-Native AWS?\nEigenCloud reframes the blockchain from a transaction ledger into a programmable trust engine. By packaging verifiability as modular primitives, Eigen Labs aims to offer an on-chain alternative to cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud, but with built-in accountability.\nThis concept, dubbed \u201cverifiability-as-a-service,\u201d introduces a new economic flywheel for the EIGEN token. As applications consume services like EigenVerify or EigenCompute, they generate usage fees payable in EIGEN, which will be used to support stakers, fund incentives and develop other innovations. While pricing and metering models for EigenCompute have yet to be disclosed, the structure positions verifiability itself as a billable digital resource.\nEigen Labs Market Context And Competitive Landscape\nWhile EigenLayer dominates the restaking narrative, competitors like Celestia (modular data availability), Story Protocol (on-chain IP verification), and Optimism\u2019s Cannon (fraud-proof generation) are also pushing toward verifiable infrastructure.\nEigenCloud\u2019s differentiation lies in its unification of data, compute, and dispute resolution into a single trust layer, which is an approach more akin to cloud-native full-stack development than blockchain tooling.\nThat said, key questions remain as slashing is still optional for AVSs, raising concerns about enforcement consistency. Meanwhile, regulatory guidance on verifiability protocols, especially in AI, healthcare, and finance, remains sparse.\nEigen Labs Founders And Backers Frame The Stakes\nSreeram Kannan, CEO of Eigen Labs, forsees EigenCloud as a key piece in the puzzle for bringing blockchain into traditional app development. Kannan commented,\n\u201cEigenCloud will enable the next generation of disruptive, mass-market crypto apps, closing the gap between what developers want to build onchain and what blockchains allow them to build\u2026 [it] expands the programmability of crypto and makes virtually anything verifiable onchain.\u201d\nJoe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of Consensys, added that verifiability is \u201cbecoming a foundational building block of the internet,\u201d and praised EigenCloud as a meaningful leap toward a more trustworthy digital stack.\nAli Yahya, General Partner at a16z crypto, echoed the sentiment, commenting, \u201cEigenLayer is surmounting the technical bottlenecks of blockchains to enable a new category of applications built on verifiable solutions.\u201d\nAccess to EigenCloud is currently being rolled out to select developers, with broader availability planned for late 2025. An ambitious roadmap includes extended developer tooling, additional slashing mechanisms, and streamlined deployment flows for AVSs.\nAs crypto enters what many call its \u201capp era,\u201d Eigen Labs is betting that verifiability will be the feature that unlocks mass developer engagement, and a new generation of use cases beyond tokens and DeFi."

The company was left with profit of $598 million, or 44 cents per share, up from $387 million, or 29 cents per share, in the same quarter a year earlier. The adjusted earnings per share excludes stock-based compensation.\n\"We could have executed better,\" CEO Antonio Neri said on a conference call with analysts. The company had higher than normal inventory for artificial intelligence servers because of a shift to next-generation Blackwell graphics processing units from Nvidia.\nThe backlog for AI systems rose 29% quarter over quarter to $3.1 billion. Total server revenue totaled $4.29 billion.\nHPE dealt with extensive discounting in the market while selling traditional servers during the quarter, finance chief Marie Myers said. As the quarter progressed, HPE moved to limit travel and discretionary spending, she said.\n\"We expect pricing adjustments may negatively impact top-line growth in the near term,\" Myers said.\nThe company said it would implement a cost-cutting program involving layoffs over the next 18 months that will lead to $350 million in gross savings by the 2027 fiscal year. Around 2,500 employees will be affected, a spokesperson said, representing about 5% of the workforce when also factoring in expected attrition. At the end of October, HPE employed 61,000 people, according to its most recent annual report.\nIn January, the U.S. Justice Department filed in a federal district court to stop HPE from acquiring Juniper Networks. HPE announced the proposed $14 billion deal in January 2024. The court expects a trial to begin in July, according to the statement. The deal should close by October 2025, HPE said. In December, the company had said the transaction would be done in early 2025.\nHPE called for 28 cents to 34 cents in adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter, with revenue coming in between $7.2 billion and $7.6 billion. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had looked for 50 cents per share on $7.93 billion in revenue.\nFor the 2025 fiscal year, HPE sees $1.70 to $1.90 in adjusted earnings per share. Analysts polled by LSEG had predicted $2.13 per share.\nHPE expects to update its prices to reflect higher expenses from U.S. tariffs, Neri said, adding that he has not perceived any business deterioration from President Donald Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency.\nAs of Thursday's close, HPE shares were up about 2% so far in 2025, while the S&P 500 index was down 2%.\nWATCH: HPE shares fall more than 10% after mixed earnings, layoff plans"

Wonder, which started as a food delivery business in 2018 but has since pivoted to operating delivery-focused restaurants in New York and Philadelphia, will take on $500 million of Grubhub\u2019s debt.\nThe divestiture comes as food and grocery delivery becomes an increasingly unprofitable endeavor for businesses that bet the farm on the model during the COVID-19 pandemic and later, when people sheltering in place and social distancing opted to order in food and grocery items they would previously buy in person.\nThe food delivery and quick-commerce sectors saw a massive influx of venture capital and other investment in the following years, with startups like Getir and Flink raising millions and investing aggressively in marketing and acquisitions.\nBut once the world returned to a semblance of normalcy and post-pandemic tailwinds trailed off, the instant delivery model proved unsustainable. Flink is now said to be valued at just under $1 billion, down from a peak of nearly $3 billion, while Getir has retreated, shutting down its operations in the U.S., the U.K., and Europe to focus on its home market of Turkey.\nJust Eat Takeaway itself has been trying to sell Grubhub for years. The company first announced it was looking to sell Grubhub in April 2022 to focus on profitability, less than a year after closing the deal to acquire it, but last year, its CEO said a sale was proving to be \u201cvery difficult.\u201d\n\u201cThe sale of Grubhub to Wonder will increase the cash generation capabilities of Just Eat Takeaway.com and will accelerate our growth,\u201d Jitse Groen, Just Eat Takeaway\u2019s CEO, said in a statement.

In Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg\u2019s opinion, hosting provider WP Engine did not sufficiently contribute to the open source project WordPress.org, and its use of the \u201cWP\u201d brand was confusing consumers about its affiliation with WordPress itself.\nIn Wednesday\u2019s announcement, Mullenweg explained that the newly announced layoffs will allow Automattic to become \u201cmore agile and responsive,\u201d \u201cbreak down silos that have created inefficiencies,\u201d \u201cfocus on product quality,\u201d and \u201censure a viable financial model for long-term success.\u201d\n\u201cTo support our customers and products, we must improve our productivity, profitability, and capacity to invest,\u201d reads the post, authored by Mullenweg.\nThe layoffs will impact employees across 90 countries, who will receive a severance package and job placement assistance, among other things.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

The layoffs include some longtime employees who have been with the company for north of a decade, we understand.\nThe news follows Automattic\u2019s cancellation of its annual \u201cGrand Meetup\u201d company retreat for 2025, a source also told us.\nAfter publication, we began hearing more about which orgs were impacted from various sources. According to at least one source, just north of 100 were from WooCommerce. We\u2019ve also heard Tumblr, Day One, and the AI orgs were impacted. (Day One layoffs were well north of 16%, as one source described the org as \u201cgutted.\u201d) In the U.S., layoffs spanned roles, including account execs, marketing, product (management and design), sales, community, business operations, advertising (16 out of 50 are left), and more. The default severance package is just 9 weeks, with exceptions for countries outside the U.S. that require more, sources said.\nAutomattic later told TechCrunch the 9-week figure was incorrect, however.\n\u201cThe public statements regarding the size of the severance packages are not true,\u201d reads a company statement on the matter. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to handling all employment matters with integrity and fairness, aligning with our core operating values. Those impacted have our enduring gratitude for their time with the company and we wish them well.\u201d\nSarah Perez can be reached at @sarahperez.01 on Signal and sarahp@techcrunch.com .

AI, glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.\nI've decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster. We typically manage out people who aren't meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we're going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle, with the intention of back filling these roles in 2025. We won't manage out everyone who didn't meet expectations for the last period if we're optimistic about their future performance, and for those we do let go, we'll provide generous severance in line with what we provided with previous cuts.\nWe'll follow up with more guidance for managers ahead of calibrations.

The move will affect less than 4% of its global workforce across different teams, geographies and levels of experience, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.\nThe announcement comes on the second day of Microsoft's 2026 fiscal year. Executives at the Redmond, Washington-based company typically unveil reorganizations at the time of the new fiscal year.\n\"We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in an email.\nMicrosoft has held several rounds of layoffs already this calendar year. In January, it cut less than 1% of headcount based on performance. The 50-year-old software company slashed more than 6,000 jobs in May and then at least 300 more in June. As of June 2024 it employed 228,000 people. In 2023, it laid off 10,000.\nPerhaps the largest culling of Microsoft workers came in 2014, when the company eliminated 18,000 after acquiring Nokia's devices and services business.\nAs was the case with the May layoffs, Microsoft is looking to reduce the number of layers of managers that stand between individual contributors and top executives, said the person who asked not to be named while discussing internal matters.\n\"To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness,\" Phil Spencer, Microsoft's CEO of gaming, wrote in a Wednesday memo to employees in that division.\nMicrosoft reported nearly $26 billion in net income on $70 billion in revenue for the March quarter. The numbers were well ahead of Wall Street's consensus, keeping Microsoft ranked as one of the most profitable companies in the S&P 500 index, according to data compiled by FactSet.\nExecutives called for about 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the June quarter, thanks to expected expansion in Azure cloud services and corporate productivity software subscriptions.\nMicrosoft stock closed at a record high of $497.45 per share on June 26.

Canva is offering career coaching and at least six months\u2019 pay to affected employees.\nThe move has unsettled staff, particularly as those impacted claim they were assured AI adoption would not lead to job losses. Employees who spoke anonymously to the Australian Financial Review said they diligently followed Canva\u2019s AI-first directive, only to find their roles deemed redundant as AI tools became more capable.\nCanva, valued at approximately A$49 billion, has been expanding its AI-driven product offerings, including text-to-image generators and background removal tools. The company is also ramping up efforts to sell its software to large enterprises ahead of a likely Nasdaq listing in the coming years. Last year, it hired former Zoom CFO Kelly Steckelberg, credited with leading Zoom\u2019s 2019 Nasdaq debut.\nCanva\u2019s layoffs reflect a growing trend in the global tech industry, where AI adoption is leading to job restructuring. While companies including Google, Meta, and Amazon have made significant workforce cuts in recent years, Australian tech firms have largely avoided AI-driven redundancies \u2013 until now.\nThe redundancies have raised concerns among Canva employees about potential future job cuts as AI platforms continue to advance. While some insiders insist the move was not driven by cost-cutting, others see it as a sign that no role is safe from AI-driven restructuring in the tech industry."

The latest, as announced in its Q4 2025 earnings call, is leaning into health and wellness instead of \u201cjust\u201d cardio fitness.\nPeloton pivots to wellness alongside another layoff\nThe company also says pricing adjustments and an assembly fee are on the way.\nThe company also says pricing adjustments and an assembly fee are on the way.\n\u201cWith each passing year, we are coming to understand better the importance of strength, stress management, sleep, and nutrition to living our best lives,\u201d CEO Peter Stern said during the call. \u201cThis creates the opportunity, no more than that, the mandate, for Peloton to evolve from being a cardio fitness partner to becoming the world\u2019s most trusted wellness partner across the full array of behaviors that maximize health demand.\u201d\nHe went on the explain that the company will focus on \u201chealth span\u201d, or the period of life a person lives in good health. \u201cAdvances in medical science contributed to the prolonging of life here in the US by a remarkable 40 years from 1900 to 2020,\u201d Stern says. \u201cHowever, as life span has increased, health span, the quality as opposed to quantity, of those years has failed to keep up. People are living longer but they\u2019re also living sicker in the U.S.\u201d\nHealth span isn\u2019t a new concept. Whoop also just released a Health Span feature with its latest tracker earlier this summer. Peloton\u2019s take on improving wellness will reportedly involve investing more in its personalized training programs, the standalone Strength Plus app, as well as meditation and sleep features. Stern also said that Peloton would test and iterate on bringing nutritional content to its platform. In a shareholder letter, Stern highlighted using AI and integrating with health tracking devices as a means to provide \u201cincreasingly personal insights, plans, and recommendations\u201d to its members.\nOn the business side, Peloton exceeded investor expectations in all metrics. It posted $607 million in revenue, roughly $21 million above the top end of its expected guidance range. Connected paid fitness subscriptions and paid app subscriptions also exceeded targets, posting 2.8 million and 552,000, respectively. Peloton shares rose roughly 11 percent on the news, but Stern noted that the company\u2019s operating expenses were still too high.\nAs a result, Stern says the company will undergo another cost restructuring plan that includes laying off about six percent of its workforce. \u201cThis is not a decision we came to lightly, as it impacts many talented team members, but we believe it is necessary for the long-term health of our business,\u201d Stern writes in the shareholder letter. This marks the company\u2019s sixth round of layoffs, coming a little over a year after the company laid off 15 percent of its workforce and former CEO Barry McCarthy stepped down.\nPeloton also plans to adjust pricing. That includes a new assembly fee for its hardware, which was previously free with purchase. (There will still be a free option for self-assembly.) The company also plans to introduce a new Special Pricing program to make its products more affordable for teachers, military personnel, first responders, and medical professionals.\nMost Popular\n- Is AI the end of software engineering or the next step in its evolution?\n- Chatbots can be manipulated through flattery and peer pressure\n- Dolby Vision 2 goes beyond HDR with more AI and \u2018authentic motion\u2019 smoothing\n- AI agents are science fiction not yet ready for primetime\n- The 20 best Labor Day deals you can grab for $100 or less"

      "text": "- Microsoft is mulling job cuts that could happen as soon as next month.\n- The cuts would aim to improve metrics such as \"span of control\" and \"PM ratio.\"\n- Earlier this year, Microsoft ousted 2,000 employees it deemed to be \"low performers.\"\nMicrosoft is considering another round of job cuts that could come as soon as May, according to people familiar with the matter.\nLeaders on some Microsoft teams are specifically discussing cuts to middle managers and how to increase the ratio of coders versus non-coders on projects, the sources told Business Insider.\nSome Microsoft organizations want to increase their \"span of control,\" or the number of employees who report to each manager, these people said.\nThe sources, who hold senior positions at the company, asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics that are still in the planning stages. It's unclear how many jobs will be cut, but one of the people said it could be a significant portion of their team. A spokesperson for Microsoft declined to comment.\nIn the tech industry, there's already a culling of middle managers underway. Amazon has been trying to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers. And in December, CEO Sundar Pichai told staff that Google cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency drive.\nInside Microsoft, the discussions focus on decreasing the \"PM ratio\" on some teams, which is the ratio of product managers or program managers to engineers.\nCharlie Bell, Microsoft's security boss, brought this concept from Amazon, where he was a cloud pioneer. There, it's called the \"builder ratio,\" and tracks the ratio of software engineers to \"non-builders,\" such as program managers and project managers.\nMicrosoft is considering increasing these targets in some organizations. For example, Bell's security organization currently has around 5\u00bd engineers to one PM, and his goal is to reach a 10-to-1 ratio, according to a person familiar with Bell's plans.\nOne of the people familiar with the matter said this ratio is basically a proxy for how many people code. The company is discussing cuts that would require managers to meet a certain budget and a specific team-based ratio, the person said.\nEarlier this year, Microsoft ousted about 2,000 employees it deemed to be low performers.\nThe potential cuts could come in a month or so and also include lower performers. One person said that at least some Microsoft leaders are considering terminating those who received an \"Impact 80\" or lower score in performance reviews for two consecutive years.\nMicrosoft evaluates employees on a scale of 0 to 200 called the \"ManageRewards slider.\" Those ratings influence how much an employee receives in stock awards and cash bonuses.\nThe middle of the range is 100, while 0, 60, and 80 are lower performers and 120, 140, and 200 are higher performers. \"Impact 80\" gives employees 60% of their normal stock award and 80% of their maximum bonus.\nHave a tip?

      "text": "Cushion, a fintech startup that described itself as the \u201cPlaid for buy now, pay later (BNPL),\u201d has shut down.\nOn Thursday, founder and CEO Paul Kesserwani posted on LinkedIn about the decision to wind down the company at the end of 2024.\nIn the post, Kesserwani said that \u201cdespite bringing multiple new fintech products to market,\u201d Cushion \u201cdidn\u2019t reach the scale needed to sustain the business.\u201d\nFounded in late 2016, San Francisco-based Cushion had raised a total of $21.6 million from investors such as Afore Capital, Flourish Ventures, Vestigo Ventures, Better Tomorrow Ventures, and 500 Global.\nIts last publicly announced raise was in May, 2022 when it closed a $12 million Series A. Its post-money valuation in 2022 was $82.4 million, according to PitchBook.\nKesserwani did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nCushion offered a consumer app that sucked in the transaction history from its users\u2019 bank accounts, determined what fees had been assessed and then conducted negotiations on their behalf to get a refund. It was designed, Kesserwani told TechCrunch in 2019, to be incentive-aligned with consumers by only taking a commission on any returned cash.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

While taking some time off to think about what he wanted to do next, he was helping his parents manage their bank accounts while they were traveling for work in Lebanon. Due to bank security policies, his parents weren\u2019t able to log into their accounts from Lebanon, and eventually, they faced a mountain of banking fees as their accounts went unattended. As Kesserwani investigated, he turned to his own accounts, and realized he had also been paying fees to the tune of $400 that he had no memory of agreeing to.\nIn Thursday\u2019s LinkedIn post, Kesserwani said that Cushion had automated bank fee negotiation and reached $3 million ARR in 10 months and processed over $300 million in BNPL loans. He added that the company had onboarded over 1 million consumers over time, with more than 200,000 paying customers.\nWrote Kesserwani: \u201cI gave Cushion everything I had for 8+ years. While the outcome wasn\u2019t what we hoped for, we built something that moved the industry forward \u2014 and I\u2019m proud of that. As for me, I\u2019m excited for what\u2019s next.\u201d\nData suggests that 2025 is expected to be another brutal year for startup shutdowns.

The company will cut 10% of its 700-person workforce, or about 70 employees. Of those, 30 are based in Israel.\nThe company says the layoffs are part of a broader streamlining effort aimed at reducing operating expenses by $8.5 million. It will record a one-time restructuring charge of $700,000 in the third quarter. Despite the cuts, Kaltura noted that its sales and marketing budgets will remain intact and are expected to grow gradually.\nIn early 2023, Kaltura laid off 11% of its employees and conducted a similar round of cuts in the summer of 2022. Kaltura, which is traded on Wall Street with a current market capitalization of $262 million, has seen its share price drop 22% since the beginning of the year. Since its IPO in 2021, the stock has declined by 85%.\nThe latest layoffs follow the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings report, which showed revenue increasing to $44.5 million. Non-GAAP gross profit rose to $31.3 million (a 70% margin), while adjusted operating profit surged to $3 million, up from just $0.5 million in the same quarter last year.\n\u201cWe exceeded the upper end of all our second quarter guidance ranges, delivering record non-GAAP net profit, an adjusted EBITDA profit that matched last quarter\u2019s record high, and strongest second-quarter operating cash flow since 2020,\u201d said Ron Yekutiel, Co-founder, Chairman, President, and CEO of Kaltura. \u201cNew bookings increased sequentially and included initial sales of our AI products. We enter the second half of the year with a robust pipeline and continue to project growth in new bookings, supported by deeper customer consolidation around our platform and the growing adoption of our AI-powered offerings.\u201d\nYekutiel added, \u201cWe\u2019ve initiated a reorganization plan that includes, among other measures, a workforce reduction of approximately 10%, aimed at realigning our operations to boost efficiency and productivity. These changes are part of a longer-term strategy, already embedded in our plans, to double adjusted EBITDA in 2026 and return to being a \u2018Rule of 30\u2019 company by or before 2028 - through a combination of double-digit revenue growth and improved adjusted EBITDA margin.\u201d\nDuring the quarter, the company closed 21 new six-figure deals across a wide range of industries, including technology, banking, financial services, manufacturing, pharma, education, and media. Notably, Kaltura also signed three first-time AI deals for its new products, Content Lab and Genie, early milestones in its AI monetization strategy. The sales backlog for these AI offerings already includes more than 100 qualified opportunities."

      "text": "Intel is shuttering its automotive architecture business and laying off most of its staff as part of a broader restructuring at the chipmaker.\nThe news was first reported by The Oregonian/Oregon Live, which cited an internal memo that was shared with employees Tuesday morning. Intel confirmed to TechCrunch that plans to wind down the auto business were communicated internally on Tuesday.\n\u201cAs we have said previously, we are refocusing on our core client and data center portfolio to strengthen our product offerings and meet the needs of our customers,\u201d according to a company statement provided by spokesperson Cory Pforzheimer. \u201cAs part of this work, we have decided to wind down the automotive business within our client computing group. We are committed to ensuring a smooth transition for our customers.\u201d\nPforzheimer said the company does not disclose the number of affected employees based on specific region, location, or business.\nIntel\u2019s automotive business might not be the dominant revenue generator at the semiconductor company, but the division has been active in automated vehicle technology and the emerging trend of \u201csoftware-defined vehicles.\u201d\nIntel made numerous multimillion-dollar investments in automotive, particularly during the heady and early days of autonomous vehicle tech that kicked off around 2015. Back then, the company\u2019s venture arm committed to invest $250 million into automotive tech. Its profile was lifted after Intel acquired Mobileye in 2017 for $15.3 billion in a bid to expand its self-driving tech. Mobileye would later spin out as a stand-alone publicly traded company, in which Intel is a major shareholder. In 2020, Intel\u2019s automotive business acquired Moovit in a deal that valued the Israeli startup at $900 million.\nThe layoffs come six months after Intel\u2019s automotive business showcased its technology at the global tech trade show CES 2025. Intel Automotive, while not one of the company\u2019s dominate businesses, has tried to sell automakers on its software-defined vehicle technology, which included an AI-enhanced system-on-chip designed for vehicles and set for production by the end of 2025.

      "text": "Lightspeed Ventures-backed audio platform Pocket FM announced it has partnered with voice-cloning company ElevenLabs to quickly convert text content, such as script, into audio series using AI.\nPocket FM, which raised $103 million in Series D funding in March, told TechCrunch at the time that it was already experimenting with the ability to convert text content into audio using ElevenLabs\u2018 tech. Now, the India-based company has expanded the partnership to make the conversion tool available to all creators over the next few weeks.\nIn the test phase, Pocket FM already produced 30,000 hours of audio series using ElevenLab\u2019s AI tech. With the new roll-out, the startup expects to triple its content library of over 100,000 hours of audio content this year. Pocket FM also said that during the experimental phase, the AI-powered tools helped it cut the cost of producing audio by 90%.\nPocket FM\u2019s co-founder and CTO Prateek Dixit told TechCrunch over a call that with this partnership, the company wants to make it easier for writers to convert their writings into audio series.\n\u201cWe have over 250,000 writers (including the ones on the company\u2019s Pocket Novel writing plaform) and this partnership decreases the cost of setting up and recording audio for them,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEven with a good set up of recording tools and equipment, writers can produce roughly 30 minutes of high-quality audio content per day. With the AI tools, this output can be 10 times more,\u201d he added.\nPocket FM has built a tool integrating ElevenLabs tech, through which it is offering 50 voices for writers who want to convert their content. ElevenLabs\u2019 co-founder Mati Staniszewski said that his company\u2019s tool understands the context of the writing and infers emotions through the voice automatically.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Google-backed Kuku FM is using GPT-4, Claude, BandLab and even ElevenLabs to help its writers with different stages of creation, including refining script, generating thumbnails, adding sound effects and converting text into audio.\nKuku FM told TechCrunch that it is also experimenting with using visual generation tools such as Midjourney and Runway to create ads related to content.\nQuality of content and impact on artists\nThe promise of AI-powered tools is to generate more content faster, but that doesn\u2019t mean the content is good. Pocket FM\u2019s answer to aiding discovery and surfacing quality content is making its discovery algorithm sophisticated and experimenting with user engagement.\n\u201cIf a writer publishes an audio series, we surface that content to a select number of users and observe engagement metrics. If these metrics are positive, we further propagate that,\u201d Dixit said.\nKuku FM said it is working with its quality control team to ensure only high-quality content is promoted on its app, even if creators have used AI in the process.\n\u201cWe realized the importance of having a human Quality Control team at the center of our decision-making when it comes to audio content production. We have developed a core team of Content Producers who have high ownership & authority on the artistic standards,\u201d the company\u2019s co-foudner and CEO Lal Chand Bisu said.\nUtilizing AI could lead to quicker results and a bigger content library for these platforms, but it will also reduce the roles of voiceover artists working with them. India\u2019s Association of Voiceover Artists (AVA) has expressed its concerns about AI taking over.\n\u201cIf AI takes over, we are finished. As voice artists, we need to get some regulation in place so that our livelihood is protected,\u201d Amarinder Singh Sodhi, the association\u2019s general secretary, told Indian publication Scroll.\nSodi also told Scroll about incidents where voiceover artists were called into the studio to record samples to train AI without obtaining their consent or informing them.\n\u201cOn an emotional level, it scares me. By using AI, you are essentially diluting the human experience of storytelling. You lose out on an emotional connection,\u201d Delhi-based voiceover artist Aditya Mattoo told TechCrunch.\nHe added that giving access to premium voices to people who don\u2019t have the taste and skill to produce quality content will lead to the market getting flooded by bad content.\nVoice artists in other parts of the world have also raised concerns about AI impacting their jobs. And despite working with some of the AI companies, they feel uncomfortable about their voices being altered.\nWhen we asked about the impact of AI-powered voice generation on Pocket FM, the company didn\u2019t directly answer the question. However, Dixit noted that engagement with AI-generated content in its experiments is \u201cas good as human voiceover production.\u201d Notably, the company is also working on technology to incorporate multiple voices in one audio output.\nBoth Pocket FM and Kuku FM don\u2019t currently label their content to indicate if AI has been used in the creation process."

      "text": "Airtime, the video startup from Evernote\u2019s founder Phil Libin, has laid off dozens of employees, TechCrunch has learned, and Airtime confirmed.\nAccording to the company, 25 people were let go from the 58-person team \u2014 a change Airtime described as \u201cbigger than usual.\u201d\nWhile Airtime characterizes the departures as part of its typical seasonal approach to employment, sources inside the company said staff were surprised by the announcement. Many were under the impression the startup intended to raise funds this year and were previously told no cuts were planned, they said.\nFormerly known as mmhmm, Airtime was launched in 2020 by Libin, whose Evernote, a note-taking startup, was valued at nearly a $1 billion at its height before being sidelined by newer competitors like Notion. (The company later sold to Bending Spoons in 2022 for a decidedly smaller figure.)\nFirst launched amid the COVID pandemic, when all office work had suddenly shifted to video, Airtime today offers two key tools for online meetings. Its \u201cAirtime Creator\u201d lets users present a deck while appearing on screen at the same time, while its \u201cAirtime Camera\u201d allows users to create custom looks to stand out in meetings.\nThe startup introduced a \u201cseasons\u201d-focused employment structure in late 2022, following a layoff of around 10%-15% of the staff, which had capped the company\u2019s headcount at 100 while it searched for product-market fit.\nThe idea was introduced so staff wouldn\u2019t face any surprise firings or layoffs. Instead, the company would decide roughly every six months who would be invited back for the next \u201cseason.\u201d This plan allowed Airtime to give staff a longer heads-up if they weren\u2019t going to return, so they had time to seek other employment. And ideally, employees would work throughout a full season before choosing to quit.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $600+ before prices rise.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nSuch a structure, as you can imagine, was controversial. But the deal had been honored on both ends since its launch.\nThe recent layoffs have frustrated staff because, typically, their \u201cseason\u201d would have ended on the last day of June, according to what their managers told them, sources told us. But impacted employees have been given an end date of Friday, June 6. That means their severance covers at least some of what would have normally been offered if they were employed through the period they were promised under the \u201cseasons\u201d arrangement.\nLibin, however, says that people\u2019s departure dates vary. Some stay an extra two weeks to finish up, and others leave sooner. And everyone is receiving six weeks of severance from their last day, so the issue here could be employee confusion or miscommunications.\nThe layoffs themselves were hashed out by leadership over two eight-hour sessions at Nobu in Palo Alto, sources claim. Staff were told on Tuesday, June 3, while their managers were told the night prior.\nAn unknown number of independent contractors were also let go, they said.\nAs to what necessitated the cuts, company insiders said Airtime\u2019s product never really took off and experienced quite a bit of churn. User acquisition ad spend also cost Airtime high tens of thousands of dollars per month, and employees report that Libin was often absent from day-to-day decisions as he focused his attention on his restaurant in Arkansas.\nAirtime, meanwhile, said the larger cuts had to do with the company\u2019s changing focus.\nIn an emailed statement attributed to Libin, Airtime said the following:\nSince 2022, Airtime has operated on a \u2018seasonal\u2019 structure: two five-and-a-half-month work seasons per year, with a shared two-week break in between. Near the end of each season, we decide who comes back based on plans for the following season. The company invites some people back, and they decide whether they want to return. There\u2019s a mutual commitment that people who return will not leave mid-season and that the company won\u2019t terminate anyone mid-season other than for serious misbehavior. We treat everyone who departs at the end of a season equally, whether or not they were invited back. Product releases, hiring, departures, promotions, and other events are also timed around the seasons to provide people with a predictable cadence. We\u2019re currently in our sixth seasonal transition, and we\u2019ve made changes to the team every time. This change is bigger than usual because our focus changed more than usual. Of 58 employees, we\u2019ve asked 33 to come back next season to work on our new products and partnerships.\nTo date, Airtime has raised nearly $135 million in venture funding across multiple early-stage rounds.\nSome of those funds were used for M&A, as with the deal to acquire filter-maker Memix in 2020, then acquire Macro, a maker of filters and reactions for online meetings, in 2021. The latter deal was focused on bringing in founders with product chops, Ankith Harathi and John Keck. (The pair has since left Airtime, according to their LinkedIn profiles.) Airtime parent All Turtles also brought in Alexander Pashintsev, who previously worked on AI at Evernote, but Airtime itself has not yet made a significant AI push.\nSarah Perez can be reached at sarahp@techcrunch.com and @sarahperez.01 on Signal. TechCrunch also offers secure tip lines here.\nCorrection: Airtime raised ~$135M, not $235M. The typo was corrected after publication; additional information about severance was also added."

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.

The company now expects a GAAP operating loss of $13 million for the fourth quarter (prior view $8 million loss), with the full year's operating income expected to be $5 million (prior view $10 million).\nThis adjustment is mainly due to the $6.5 million restructuring charge, partially offset by a $1.5 million reduction in stock-based compensation expenses.\nDespite these adjustments, LiveRamp has reaffirmed its revenue and non-GAAP operating income outlook for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending March 31, 2025.\nPrice Action: RAMP shares are trading higher by 0.84% at $28.65 in premarket at last check Friday.\nRead Next:\nImage via Shutterstock.\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Cognition, the AI coding startup that acquired rival company Windsurf three weeks ago, laid off 30 employees last week and is offering buyouts to the roughly 200 remaining employees on the team, reports The Information.\nThis is the latest bout of whiplash that Windsurf employees have faced after a tumultuous stretch for the company. The startup was initially almost acquired by OpenAI, then lost its CEO, co-founder, and research leads to Google in a $2.4 billion deal known as a reverse-acquihire (where Google hired the key talent rather than buying the company), before ultimately getting acquired by Cognition.\nAt the time of the acquisition, Cognition stated that 100% of Windsurf employees would receive financial compensation as part of the deal and stressed that the company was excited to bring on Windsurf\u2019s \u201cworld-class people\u201d to develop top-notch coding tools.\nNow, it\u2019s becoming clear that Windsurf\u2019s intellectual property, not its talent, was the real buy.\nAccording to an email The Information viewed, employees were given until August 10 to decide whether they want to take the buyout, which amounts to nine months of salary. Those who choose to stay are reportedly required to spend six days at the office and clock more than 80-hour weeks \u2014 draconian conditions that have become table stakes among workers at top AI firms.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe in work-life balance\u2014building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn\u2019t possibly separate the two,\u201d wrote Cognition CEO Scott Wu in the email.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Cognition for more details.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

      "text": "Google told staffers in its \"People Operations\" and cloud organizations this week that it plans to cut employees as part of internal reorganizations, CNBC has learned.\nThe company will offer a voluntary exit program to U.S.-based, full-time employees in People Operations, Google's human relations division, starting in early March, according to a memo issued Tuesday by HR chief Fiona Cicconi that was viewed by CNBC.\nThe latest cuts come after finance chief Anat Ashkenazi said one of her top priorities would be to drive more cost-cutting as Google expands its spending on AI infrastructure in 2025. After the company on Feb. 3 reported revenue that missed expectations for the fourth quarter, Ashkenazi said Google had strong demand for AI products and that it \"exited the year with more demand than we had available capacity.\"\nAs part of the HR buyouts, employees who are level 4 and level 5 may receive a severance of 14 weeks of salary and one additional week for every full year of service, the memo says. Those are considered mid- to senior-level employees.\nSeparately, the company also made cuts to several teams within its cloud unit, mostly affecting operations support staff, according to sources and separate internal memos. Some of those moves include moving roles to other countries.\nThe company confirmed the changes to CNBC, saying reorganizations are part of the normal course of business.\n\"Our teams have continued to make changes to operate more efficiently, remove layers, and ensure they are set up for long term success,\" Google spokesperson Brandon Asberry said in a statement. \"This work is ongoing as we continue to invest in our company's biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead.\"\nIn January, Google executives said they would offer buyouts to U.S.-based employees in the company's \"Platforms and Devices\" unit ahead of expected cuts. That unit houses more than 25,000 full-time employees who work on Android, Chrome, ChromeOS, Google Photos, Google One, Pixel, Fitbit and Nest.\nThe company said it is supporting all affected employees, in line with local requirements, including time to explore and apply to different roles at Google.\nCloud cuts\nThe Alphabet-owned company's cloud layoffs affected the unit's sales operations, customer experience, internal deal and go-to-market teams, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they are not permitted to speak publicly.\nCloud is one of the company's high-growth business units and benefits from AI products. For the fourth quarter, the cloud unit's revenue increased 30% from the year prior. Alphabet has been drawing profit from the cloud business as it tries to keep up with market leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.\nSome affected employees' roles are being relocated to India and Mexico City, according to people familiar with the matter and internal correspondence viewed by CNBC.\nThe company confirmed that the changes include consolidating or opening roles in other parts of the U.S and overseas. The largest employee presence for the cloud unit is still in the U.S., and that's not changing, the company added.\nThe number of layoffs is unclear, but the company said it is small in quantity and that the organization continues to hire for critical sales and engineering roles.\nBloomberg first reported the cuts to Google's cloud division Wednesday.\nWATCH: Google reportedly to be hit with EU charges of infringing on Apple, Meta platforms"

      "text": "Vendease, a Y Combinator-backed food procurement startup in Nigeria, has implemented its second round of layoffs in five months as part of a restructuring effort to achieve profitability and extend its financial runway. A company spokesperson confirmed the layoffs to TechCabal, saying the move aligns with the startup\u2019s shift toward a more capital-efficient model while it seeks to close a Series A extension round.\nThe latest layoffs, which begin today, will affect about 120 employees (44% of staff). This follows a previous round in September 2024, which impacted 68 employees (20% of staff).\n\u201cRestructuring takes time and happens in phases,\u201d Mohamed Chaudry, Vendease\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, told TechCabal. He said the company is moving toward a \u201clean team\u201d to improve operational efficiency.\nDespite raising $33 million since its founding in 2019, Vendease has struggled with macroeconomic headwinds, including naira devaluation and rising inflation, which have significantly increased operational costs. The company did not disclose how much of the $33 million remains or how it has been allocated.\nWhile the company claims revenue has grown 600% year-on-year over the past two years, revenues have likely remained flat in dollar terms, possibly hindering expansion.\nBeyond staff reductions, Vendease is making key strategic shifts to improve financial sustainability. A major change involves repurposing its buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) offering from a loss leader to a revenue-generating product. Previously, the company absorbed interest costs for long-term loan payments, allowing customers to finance food purchases at a flat fee. Now, it has switched to a daily interest model, enabling Vendease to profit from lending while customers pay pro-rata interest.\n\u201cVendors were willing to wait four days for goods from Vendease, even with instant-purchase options from other suppliers, because of the access to credit,\u201d Chaudry explained. The new model aims to monetize this demand while improving cash flow.\nIn addition to restructuring, Vendease has introduced in-house AI technology to automate previously manual processes, such as demand forecasting and resource planning. The company claims this shift is improving capital efficiency, though it has not disclosed specific cost savings or performance metrics.\nVendease\u2019s investors\u2014including Partech, TLcom Capital, VentureSouq, Hustle Fund, and Hack VC\u2014are supportive of the company\u2019s pivot, according to Chaudry. He added that several investors have committed to participating in the ongoing Series A extension round, though Vendease declined to disclose the target raise.\nWhile Chaudry stated that the extended runway and incoming funding will help Vendease achieve the milestones necessary for a Series B round, he did not specify what those milestones are. Given the company\u2019s challenges, profitability and sustained growth in dollar terms will likely be key hurdles.\nVendease\u2019s restructuring underscores a broader trend among Nigerian startups adjusting to economic realities\u2014focusing less on rapid expansion and more on profitability, efficiency, and sustainable business models.\nNgozi Chukwu reports on e-commerce for TechCabal. She can be reached at ngozi@bigcabal.com or on X, @NgoziChukwu_.\nEditor\u2019s note: This article has been updated to clarify that Vendease operates everywhere in Nigeria, not only in six states. It also corrects the number of employees laid off five months ago to 68. Additionally, the latest layoffs impact 44% of the company\u2019s staff, not the previously reported figure of about 30%."

As a result of the changes, Wondery CEO Jen Sargent is exiting her post after four years at the helm of one of the industry\u2019s largest podcast studios.\nAmazon disclosed the changes with an internal memo from Steve Boom, who is VP of audio, Twitch and games for Amazon. The reorganization will include about 100 layoffs.\nThe Wondery brand will continue as an outlet for celebrity and personality driven podcasts such as Dax Shepard\u2019s \u201cArmchair Expert\u201d and the recent deal that Wondery struck with NBA great LeBron James and football superstars Travis and Jason Kelce.\nPopular on Variety\nWondery podcasts that were more narrative-driven such as true crime favorites \u201cDr. Death\u201d and \u201cDirty John\u201d will now shift under the Audible brand, which encompasses original audio production as well as a vast audio book library.\nAmazon acquired Wondery in 2020.

      "text": "E-commerce shifts to AI: Yotpo lays off about 200 employees\nMove affects 34% of global workforce as unicorn refocuses on core products and AI-led strategy.\nIsraeli-founded unicorn Yotpo is laying off approximately 200 employees, representing around 34% of its global workforce, as part of a major strategic overhaul, Calcalist has learned. The layoffs affect about 80 employees in Israel, with the remainder spread across offices in Bulgaria, Poland, London, New York, and Australia.\nAs part of this restructuring, Yotpo is shutting down its Email and SMS marketing operations, selling the customer base to U.S. marketing platform Attentive in a deal estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars. Instead, Yotpo will integrate Attentive\u2019s offerings into its platform while refocusing on its core products: Reviews and Loyalty. Alongside Attentive, Yotpo is also partnering with Omnisend to onboard self-serve and fast-growing brands.\nThe company describes the move as part of its transformation into a \"profitable, product-first company\" with a clear AI-first approach.\n\u201cToday, we have a very clear strategy: a deep focus on our core products - Reviews and Loyalty - and on AI, technology, infrastructure, and every internal process,\u201d said Tomer Tagrin, Yotpo co-founder and CEO. \u201cIn the coming months, Yotpo will stop offering its Email and SMS products. Instead, we are partnering with the leading platforms in the field and investing all our resources in building best-in-class Reviews and Loyalty solutions.\u201d\nTagrin acknowledged the personal toll of the layoffs, calling it \"a painful but necessary process.\"\n\u201cI truly believe that tomorrow\u2019s companies will be smaller, more focused, and much more AI-based,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we must put ourselves in this reality, not just talk about it, but act accordingly\u2026 This is a painful but necessary step and I want to say a deep and personal thank you to each and every one of you. You are part of Yotpo\u2019s DNA - and always will be.\u201d\nYotpo says the strategic pivot is already yielding innovation. The company has launched a wave of AI-powered products, including: Automated review summaries that improve conversion rates; Smart sorting tools and support for translations in over 50 languages;A review analytics engine called Reviews Atlas; Beta launch of a new Loyalty Tiers system; and full adaptation of customer reviews for use in large language models (LLMs).\nInternally, Yotpo has already adopted AI at scale: 70% of basic support requests are handled via AI tools; 90% of marketing campaigns over the past year were built using AI; The company estimates 40% of new code will be written using generative AI by 2026;Finance, sales, and customer service workflows are being rebuilt with an AI-first mindset.\nYotpo currently serves more than 25,000 global brands, including Steve Madden, IKEA, Patagonia, GoPro, and others. Despite the layoffs, the company continues to employ hundreds of staff in Israel, the U.S., and other markets.\nFounded by Tomer Tagrin and Omri Cohen, Yotpo has raised a total of $406 million to date. Its most recent round in March 2021 raised $230 million at a $1.4 billion valuation. Previous investors include Tiger Global, Bessemer Venture Partners, Shopify, Vertex, Vintage, Rhodium, and others."

The decision to close the company and lay off several employees comes despite a significant increase in operating revenue for ANS Commerce.\nUpdated Mar 2, 2025 08:13 IST\nFlipkart has made the difficult decision to wind down ANS Commerce. This comes three years after acquiring the Gurugram-based company, which had been providing a wide range of e-commerce services, including store technology, performance marketing, and warehousing solutions.\nFlipkart's decision to close ANS commerce\nAccording to a report mentioned in the Times of India, Flipkart has made the difficult decision to wind down ANS Commerce. This comes three years after acquiring the Gurugram-based company, which had been providing a wide range of e-commerce services, including store technology, performance marketing, and warehousing solutions. Despite a 39.4% rise in operating revenue to Rs 54 crore in FY24, ANS Commerce's net loss widened to Rs 73.8 crore.The acquisition of ANS commerce\nANS Commerce was acquired by Flipkart for an estimated Rs 250-300 crore ($35-40 million) three years ago. The company, founded by Amit Monga, Vibhor Sahare, Sushant Puri, and Nakul Singh, had been serving major brands like Jack & Jones, Vero Moda, HUL, and Lakme. ANS Commerce had raised $2.2 million in a pre-Series A round in 2021 before its acquisition.Layoffs and transition\nThe shutdown of ANS Commerce has also resulted in significant layoffs, with several employees affected by the closure. Flipkart has assured that it will handle the transition smoothly for all involved parties. Despite the loss of jobs, the company is committed to helping employees move forward.What\u2019s next for Flipkart?\nThe closure of ANS Commerce raises questions about Flipkart\u2019s strategy in the e-commerce space. As the company focuses more on scaling its core operations, this move could be an attempt to streamline its resources and redirect focus on other key areas. It will be interesting to see how Flipkart adapts its approach to e-commerce enablement moving forward.Tech layoffs continue in 2025\nThe pattern of layoffs at tech companies is not exclusive to Autodesk. According to Layoffs.fyi, 59 major companies have laid off 13,802 tech workers so far this year. Meta said earlier this year that, depending on performance, it will lay off 5% of its employees.

The company employed approximately 100 people in Israel and another 200 in the United States.\nIn Israel, employees were informed that their final salary would not be paid and were advised to contact the National Insurance Institute. On Monday, Skybox\u2019s CEO, Mordecai Rosen, held a meeting with employees to officially announce the company's closure and the layoffs. Simultaneously, an email was sent to all employees regarding their next steps.\nIn a statement issued to its employees, the company wrote that it is entering the final phase of its existence and is shutting down. \"Liquidation is the final step in closing a company. It involves ceasing operations, selling assets, and using the proceeds to pay creditors, including employees.\"\nAt the same time, Skybox sold all of its business and technology to Israeli cybersecurity company Tufin. In a statement published on Tufin\u2019s website, the company CEO Ray Brancato wrote: \"On February 24, 2025, Skybox made the difficult decision to close its operations effective immediately. For those impacted by this event, we understand this is an uncertain time, and we want to assure you that Tufin is here to help plot your path forward. As the leader in Network Security Policy Management, we are committed to providing a smooth transition for Skybox customers, ensuring you have the tools, expertise, and guidance to continue securing your networks without disruption. Tufin is the most financially stable company in our industry\u2014we are profitable, growing, and well-positioned for the future. We know that Skybox customers have been impacted by their sudden closure, and we want to reassure you that Tufin is here for the long run.\"\nIn 2017, Skybox raised $150 million in a major funding round led by CVC Capital Partners, which invested $100 million, with an additional $50 million coming from London-headquartered Pantheon Ventures. That round took the company's total funding to $288 million. In early 2016, the American investment fund Providence acquired 75% of Skybox for $96 million, valuing the company at $120 million.\nSkybox was founded in 2002 by Gidi Cohen, who served as CEO before being succeeded by Rosen. The company developed cybersecurity management software that uses advanced analytics to prioritize network risks and provide recommendations for optimal responses. Its technology was designed to address complex network environments, including physical, virtual, cloud, and operational technology (OT) infrastructures."

      "text": "Commercetools \u2014 a \u201cheadless commerce\u201d platform that provides APIs to companies building online storefronts \u2014 saw a major boost in its business just a few years ago, raising money at a whopping $1.9 billion valuation as the world went shopping online in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and businesses rushed to improve their e-commerce operations.\nToday, the playbook looks a little different for e-commerce, and for Commercetools.\nTechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Commercetools has laid off dozens of employees over the last few weeks, including around 10% of staff earlier Wednesday, after failing to meet its sales growth targets. It\u2019s also making a number of executive changes, including parting ways with its chief revenue officer and CFO, and reassigning the roles previously held by its chief information security and compliance officer.\n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve made meaningful progress and our business continues to grow, over the last several quarters we haven\u2019t fully achieved our aggressive revenue growth targets,\u201d CEO Andrew Burton said in a memo to the company, which TechCrunch has viewed. \u201cThat reality has required me, our executive team, and our Board to take a hard, in-depth look at where we fell short, where we showed strength, and what needs to change to build a stronger future.\u201d\n\u201cSignificant\u201d restructuring will be carried out in marketing, sales, and internal operations such as HR and finance, according to the memo. Select staff in customer and product development will also be cut \u201cafter reviewing performance and impact.\u201d\nThe full memo, shared by a source and confirmed as authentic by the company, is published below.\nBurton, speaking to TechCrunch after we contacted the company about the memo, said that around 10% of the company\u2019s employees were affected today, but declined to give an exact number. A source, who spoke to TechCrunch on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday\u2019s layoffs total more than 70 people and, including selective reductions he claimed happened over a period of several weeks, make up to 20% of staff. The company disputes that there have been any layoffs beyond those announced Wednesday. Burton also added the company has 25-30 open roles it\u2019s looking to fill.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nIt\u2019s a difficult bump in the road for a company that appears to have had a strong run in the market.\nOriginally founded in 2006 in Munich, Germany, Commercetools raised just $30 million in outside funding before it was acquired by retail giant REWE in 2015. By 2019, it was seeing its revenues growing at 110% annually. REWE spun it out as a startup again, backed with $145 million in funding from Insight Partners at a $300 million valuation.\nAfter COVID-19 hit, Commercetools\u2019 business boomed as shopping of all kinds went digital. Less than three years after that Insight round, it was able to raise $140 million at a $1.9 billion valuation led by Accel.\nThrough all of this, Commercetools\u2019 founder Dirk Hoerig led the company as CEO. He stepped away from the top position in July 2024, to be replaced by Burton. (Hoerig has retained a seat on the board and is the company\u2019s chief innovation officer.)\nAt the time, the company was making \u201cfar beyond\u201d $100 million in annual recurring revenue, and Burton\u2019s arrival was seen as a precursor to the company going public, reportedly in 2025 or 2026. Burton declined to comment today on an IPO or other future plans.\nThe memo cites, at a high level, that Commercetools was missing its growth targets. There have been other more specific shifts in the market.\nWhile Commercetools was a very early mover in the space of \u201cheadless commerce\u201d \u2014 a term first coined by Hoerig \u2014 a number of competitors have emerged in more recent years. Chief among them is Shopify, which originally pitched itself to smaller merchants and has gradually grown into working with the same larger retailers that Commercetools targets.\nAt the same time, e-commerce has continued to grow, but not at the breakneck pace seen between 2020 and 2022. The most recent U.S. Census Bureau figures noted that U.S. retail e-commerce grew just 2.7% from the third to the fourth quarter of 2024, totaling $308.9 billion and accounting for 16.4% of all retail sales. Earlier today, eBay noted that its Q4 sales grew just 1%.\nBurton also cited question marks over how tariffs would play out as another factor impacting e-commerce companies, and the knock-on effect that has on suppliers like Commercetools.\n\u201cWe had really ambitious goals that we had not reset to reflect the macro-economic uncertainty,\u201d Burton told TechCrunch Wednesday.\nFinally, while brand-owned storefronts \u2014 a mainstay business for companies like Commercetools \u2014 continue to make up a giant part of the e-commerce market, they\u2019re also competing against a new wave of marketplaces. Temu, Instagram, and TikTok all represent a new kind of social commerce that once again could change the game. Other \u201cheadless\u201d companies \u2014 be they focused on e-commerce or content management or something else \u2014 that have seen growth with the growth of the internet now have to respond to changing tides, be it a new method of content consumption or buying goods, or AI.\nThe ball\u2019s in the court for companies like Commercetools to anticipate and build for wherever and however people may want to shop in the future.\nMemo below:\nSubject: Important Update\nHi team,\nOver the past few years, we set ambitious goals, anticipating strong market growth. While we\u2019ve made meaningful progress and our business continues to grow, over the last several quarters we haven\u2019t fully achieved our aggressive revenue growth targets. That reality has required me, our executive team, and our Board to take a hard, in-depth look at where we fell short, where we showed strength, and what needs to change to build a stronger future.\nAs part of this, we made the difficult decision to restructure a few teams, implement targeted reductions in specific areas, and eliminate some roles. This decision is not a reflection on individual commercetoolers, their talent, dedication, or impact, but instead a necessary step to sharpen our focus and re-position commercetools to be in a stronger position to navigate and succeed in this turbulent market.\nMany of you have built strong relationships with the colleagues who are leaving today. They have shaped commercetools in ways big and small, and we are truly grateful. We are providing all impacted employees with severance and continued benefits above the market standard. Additionally, we are continuing their access to OpenUp, our online platform offering diverse mental health support resources, to support them in this transition.\nI know this is hard news to process. Change brings uncertainty, and we are committed to providing as much clarity, support, and direction as possible. To help answer common questions, we\u2019ve put together an Employee FAQ that outlines key details about the restructuring, resources available, and what\u2019s next.\nTo give everyone space to reflect, we are giving all employees this Friday, February 28th as a day off.\nYour executive leader will meet with your department later today or tomorrow to discuss what this means for you and your team.\nWhat\u2019s Changing\nC-level Updates:\n- Bruno Teuber (CRO) \u2013 Transitioning out of the executive team, staying as an advisor until the end of H1. A new CRO search has started; in the interim, sales will report to me.\n- Dan Murphy (CFO) \u2013 Transitioning out of the executive team, advising until the end of H1. CFO role will not be backfilled; Finance, Digital Solutions, and Legal will report to Matt Tuel (COO).\n- Denis Werner (Chief Information Security & Compliance Officer) \u2013 Moving to a compliance-focused role under Dirk H\u00f6rig. IT Ops moving to Digital Solutions under Matt Tuel, Information Security moving to Product under Hajo Eichler, and Office Management moving to People under Roxana Dobrescu.\nTeams with Significant Restructuring:\n- Marketing (including BDRs) \u2013 Realignment to focus on enterprise GTM model and sales PODs.\n- Sales & Operations \u2013 Restructuring to improve sales support and focus on top markets/customers.\n- Enablement Functions (Finance, People, etc.) \u2013 Consolidating teams for better operational efficiency.\n- Other Impacted Areas \u2013 Select cuts in Customer and Product Development after reviewing performance and impact.\nChange is never easy, but it\u2019s at the core of what we do \u2014 helping businesses adapt to new realities. Now, we\u2019re doing the same. In our Company All Hands tomorrow, we will walk through these changes in more detail \u2014 the why, what, and how we move forward together \u2014 staying true to our belief in adapting boldly to build what\u2019s next.\nAndrew\nUpdated to note that Commercetools disputes the total number of layoffs claimed by a source."

TikTok initially landed on the Eastside as just another tech company looking for some office space, but in 2023 it launched its e-commerce division TikTok Shop and heavily expanded those operations next door to Amazon.\nAll of the employees laid off Monday are TikTok Shop employees.\n\u201cAs the TikTok Shop business evolves, we regularly review our operations to ensure long-term success,\u201d a TikTok spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \u201cFollowing careful consideration, we\u2019ve made the difficult decision to adjust parts of our team to better align with strategic priorities.\u201d\nTikTok was Bellevue\u2019s seventh-largest employer last year, according to a recent financial report from the city. The only tech employers ahead of it were Meta, Bellevue-headquartered T-Mobile and Amazon.\nTikTok\u2019s growth in Bellevue occurred as the company faced federal scrutiny and a potential ban in the U.S. if parent company ByteDance doesn\u2019t sell it off. ByteDance is based in Beijing, raising fears among lawmakers that the Chinese government may be using the app to collect users data.\nThe Trump administration has punted the law banning TikTok, passed during the Biden administration, leaving the company in a limbo every time a new divest-or-ban deadline nears.\nThe Information reported Sunday that TikTok is building an app for U.S. users ahead of the sale-or-ban deadline in September.\nTikTok offered a small boost of hope for Bellevue\u2019s office market, especially after Microsoft and Meta vacated space throughout the city. TikTok started with a 44,000-square-foot sublease in the Key Center tower eventually growing to more than 442,000 square feet across that tower and the Lincoln Square North tower.\nTikTok is at least the second tech company in Washington to announce layoffs this year and is on the heels of larger cuts at Microsoft. The Redmond-based tech giant laid off 15,000 employees between May and July, 3,120 of whom were based in Washington.\nThe opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times."

      "text": "LONDON \u2014 British digital remittances company Zepz is laying off dozens of IT workers and is in the process of closing down business units in Poland and Kenya.\nRoughly 200 staff members will be impacted by the redundancy measures, two employees who were made redundant told CNBC, asking to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.\nAs of January, London-headquartered Zepz \u2014 formerly known as WorldRemit \u2014 had a global headcount of 1,000 people, meaning the redundancies affect around 20% of its total workforce.\nThe layoffs affect several IT functions at the company, including database administration, development operations and software engineering, the former employees said.\nZepz confirmed to CNBC that it was reducing headcount in order to \"sustainably support the next phase of long-term strategic goals and continued growth.\" The company declined to comment on the number of employees impacted by the layoffs, with a spokesperson explaining that the redundancy process was ongoing.\n\"Following the successful completion of its replatforming efforts, bolstered by advanced automation and AI, Zepz has embarked on a strategic initiative to optimise operations across the organisation,\" a Zepz spokesperson told CNBC by email.\n\"This transformation has reinforced the technology foundation and reduced the need for certain operational and technical capacities, prompting a proposed reduction in roles as part of the overall plan,\" the spokesperson added.\nZepz has been touted as one of Britain's fintech darlings. The company was founded by Ismail Ahmed, a Somalia-born British entrepreneur who fled the country during the Somali Civil War. Ahmed today serves as the company's non-executive chairman.\nThe group was renamed Zepz following the acquisition of money transfer platform Sendwave in 2020, with the brand and WorldRemit coming under one parent company.\n'Difficult choice'\nCNBC obtained a company memo announcing the cost-cutting measures shared by Zepz CEO Mark Lenhard internally in January.\n\"Today we are announcing a very difficult decision \u2014 proposed reductions in our team across all HQ functions, and most regions. And specifically we are proposing the closure of our Kenya and Poland employing entities,\" Lenhard said in the memo.\nZepz touts itself as a \"remote-first employer,\" with regional offices in Kenya and Poland.\n\"This is a difficult choice, which impacts the lives of our colleagues and friends. This is also a choice which is critical to the success of our mission to serve immigrants everywhere. Both facts are true, at the same time,\" Lenhard said.\n\"To be clear, this is not a change of strategy. We're doubling down on our mission in an effort to expand our impact faster,\" he added. \"In some places, this will mean we'll need to continue to ruthlessly prioritize. In others, we're going to get more efficient. In many cases it will involve rethinking how we do things today.\"\nZepz's spokesperson insisted that the IT worker layoffs \"will not impact customers in any region or market,\" and added that the firm \"remains committed to its mission of serving migrants worldwide, driving innovation, and delivering meaningful financial solutions to millions globally.\"\nThis isn't the first time Zepz has cut a spate of roles to save on costs. In 2023, Zepz laid off 420 employees, which accounted for about 26% of its global headcount at the time. Later that year, Zepz slashed a further 30 roles across its people and marketing functions.\nZepz has long been touted as a potential IPO candidate, but a timeline for this is unclear. Counting the likes of Accel, TCV and Leapfrog as investors, the startup was valued at $5 billion in 2021. The company announced a $267 million funding round last year.\nZepz faces competition from several notable digital payments players including PayPal, Wise, Revolut and Remitly.\nWATCH: We now have 'a whole generation' of fintechs preparing for IPOs, says QED Investors' Nigel Morris"

      "text": "Women\u2019s healthcare got another capital infusion today in HerMD, which announced $18 million in additional Series A funding, showing that this area continues to be of interest to investors.\nMy colleague Dominic-Madori Davis reported earlier this year that women\u2019s health companies raised about $1.16 billion in 2022. Though down from $1.41 billion in 2021, this is still a vast improvement over the $496 million raised in 2020, according to PitchBook data.\nHerMD is among a group of companies (for example, Herself Health, Tia Health, Vira Health and Adyn) providing care options specifically for women, at all stages of their lives, and attracting venture capital for their approaches.\nFounder and chief medical officer Dr. Somi Javaid opened the first HerMD location in 2015 in Cincinnati to help change the notion that less than 20% of OBGYNs are trained in menopause and sexual health care. She later brought on Kathy McAleer as CEO in 2022.\nThe company offers comprehensive women\u2019s healthcare, either in-person or virtual, and one of its differentiators is that the average appointment is between 20 and 60 minutes. All medical services are insurance- and Medicare-based. In addition, HerMD provides aesthetic services, including facial injectables and body treatments.\nTo address the lack of training, the company created the HerMD University that centers around proprietary algorithms of care to take providers from classroom to clinic. Providers are able to attend health conferences around menopause and sexual health and participate in monthly meetings.\n\u201cThe first thing we had to fix was the educational component,\u201d Javaid told TechCrunch. \u201cSome providers have told us that they get more education in the first couple of weeks at HerMD University than they have in their entire career. Then we had to give our providers and patients more time.\u201d\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

You want to climb the ladder, you climb a ladder. And we give work-life balance, so we have almost zero turnover.\u201d\nHerself Health, providing primary care to women 65 and over, raises $26M\nMeanwhile, the Series A extension was led by existing investor JAZZ with participation from Amboy Street Ventures and B-Flexion. The new investment brings HerMD\u2019s total funding to nearly $30 million.\nWith the funding, the company will expand its brick-and-mortar locations, including the first in the New York City area and a second Nashville-area clinic. HerMD will also continue developing its virtual services and HerMD University and grow its team \u2014 Javaid said there are 100 providers eager to join. The company will also launch mental health services and invest in the latest technologies around sexual health and menopause.\n\u201cWe will also be introducing e-commerce and physician-curated products,\u201d Javaid said. \u201cHospital-based systems, and relationships like that, is another thing that we would love to do. We rely on hospitals for imaging, primary care and obstetric and oncology care, but a lot of hospital systems say they struggle because their providers aren\u2019t trained in menopause and sexual health. They need a partner like us, and I see HerMD having over 200 clinics in the future.\u201d\nDespite 2022\u2019s headwinds, women\u2019s health startups did better than ever before"

      "text": "E-commerce these days is now a major part of every retailer\u2019s strategy, so technology builders and platforms that are helping them compete better on digital screens are seeing a huge boost in business. In the latest turn, Commercetools \u2014 a provider of e-commerce APIs that larger retailers can use to build customized payment, check-out, social commerce, marketplace and other services \u2014 has closed $140 million in funding, a Series C that CEO Dirk Hoerig has confirmed to me values the company at $1.9 billion.\nThe funding is being led by Accel, with previous investors Insight Partners and REWE Group also participating. Munich, Germany-based Commercetools spun out of REWE \u2014 a giant German retailer, and also a customer \u2014 and announced $145 million in investment led by Insight in October 2019.\nThis latest round represents a huge hike on its valuation since then, when Commercetools was valued at around $300 million.\nPart of the reason for the big bump, of course, has been the wave of interest in digital transactions from shopping online. E-commerce was already growing at a steady pace before 2020, by some estimates representing more than half of all commerce transactions. The COVID-19 pandemic turbo-charged that proportion, with many retailers switching exclusively to internet sales, and consumers stuck at home happy to shop with a click.\nWhile companies like Shopify have addressed the needs of smaller retailers, providing them with an alternative or complement to listing on third-party marketplaces like Amazon\u2019s, Commercetools has built its business around catering to larger retailers and the many specific, large-scale needs and investment budgets that they may have for building their digital commerce solutions.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nIt provides some 300 APIs today around some nine \u201cbuckets\u201d of services, and a wide network of integration partners, Hoerig said, and powers some $10 billion of sales annually for its customers, which include the likes of Audi, AT&T, Danone, Tiffany & Co., John Lewis and many others.\n\u201cOur main focus is the retailer with more than $100 million in gross merchandise value,\u201d Hoerig said. \u201cThis is when it becomes interesting.\u201d But he added that the force of market growth is such that Commercetools is also seeing a lot of business from smaller companies that are simply needing more functionality to address their fast growth. \u201cSo we also sometimes have customers that start at $5 million in GMV and quickly go to $50 million. With that scale, they also have specific requirements, so the lines get a bit blurry.\u201d (And that also explains why investors are so interested: there is a lot of evidence of the market growing and growing; and by capturing smaller retailers on big trajectories, that represents a lot more scale for Commercetools.)\nHoerig is sometimes credited with being the person who first coined the term \u201cheadless commerce\u201d, which basically means APIs that can be used by a company, or its team of strategists, developers and designers, to build their own customized check-out and other purchasing experiences, rather than fitting these into templates provided by the tech company powering the checkout.\nBut as the API economy has continued to grow, and the world of non-tech companies that use tech continues to mature, that has taken on a mass-market appeal, and so Commercetools is far from being the only one in this area. In addition to Shopify (which has its own version targeting larger businesses, Shopify Plus), others include Spryker, Swell, Fabric, Chord and Shogun.\nCommercetools will be using the funding both to continue organically expanding its business, but also to make some acquisitions to bolt on new customers, and new technology, tapping into some of the scaling and consolidation that is taking place across e-commerce as a whole. What will be interesting to see is where consolidation will happen, and which startups will be raising money to scale on their own: right now there is a lot of enthusiasm around the space because it is so buoyant, and that will spell more money being funneled to more startups.\nCase in point: When I first got wind of this funding round, Commercetools told me it was in the middle of a deal to acquire a company. In the end, that company decided to stay independent and take some more investment to try to grow on its own. Hoerig said it\u2019s now pursuing another target.\nIndeed, that is also the bigger force that has brought Commercetools to where it is today.\n\u201cThe chance to invest in a fast-growing, innovative commerce platform was one we could not pass up,\u201d said Ping Li, the partner at Accel who led on this deal, in a statement. \u201cCommercetools provides e-commerce enterprises the technology necessary to capture revenue in the rapidly growing global e-commerce market.\u201d"

The employees' final day will be March 8.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nAn Icon spokesperson wrote that the team realignment is to \"focus on our highest priorities,\" which they said will accelerate the development of its new robotic printing system, called Phoenix.\n\"While our mission remains to develop these intelligent machines to build humanity\u2019s future, we will continue to design and build a selection of key projects across residential, hospitality, social/affordable and those within the Department of Defense with a more streamlined team,\" the spokesperson wrote.\nIcon was co-founded by Jason Ballard and showcased its first 3D-printed home during the South by Southwest Conference and Festivals in 2018. It has since used its Vulcan 3D printing technology to build dozens of homes and structures, including barracks for the Texas Military Department, and is even working with NASA to develop habitats for the moon.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nIcon has grown to employ more than 400 people and has printed more than 100 homes for less expense and at a quicker pace than traditional building methods. Icon Chief Operating Officer Graeme Waitzkin told the American-Statesman in December that using 3D-printing during construction can be more cost effective, more sustainable and faster than traditional builds while using less labor.\nIcon has built the world's largest 3D-printed community in Georgetown, which neared completion last year. It began selling the homes in 2023. Icon is also building a community, called Wimberley Springs, in Wimberley, for which the model home has just been completed. To build the community, Icon used its Vulcan printers. Icon used those same printers to build a 3D-printed training and innovation center at Camp Mabry.\nAt South by Southwest in 2024, Icon unveiled details about the new Phoenix printer, which can not only build the walls of a 3D-printed home but also the foundation and roof.\nPhoenix lowers costs while expanding design potential, Ballard said at SXSW last year. The printer, which looks crane-like with a building-scale robotic arm, has more range of movement to print in a steady line and avoids some limitations of the Vulcan printer."

The news was announced at around 4PM ET, and a letter to employees from interim CEO Tom Conrad was posted on Sonos\u2019 website shortly thereafter. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve observed first hand is that we\u2019ve become mired in too many layers that have made collaboration and decision-making harder than it needs to be,\u201d Conrad wrote. \u201cSo across the company today we are reorganizing into flatter, smaller, and more focused teams.\u201d\nSonos lays off 200 employees as its struggles continue\nThe audio company is going through the most difficult period it has ever faced.

Interim CEO Tom Conrad believes getting smaller and more focused is the way forward.\nConrad clearly sees a need to rethink the way Sonos operates as part of the company\u2019s turnaround effort. Sonos is scheduled to report its latest quarterly earnings on Thursday afternoon. And if this is the precursor to that, the near-term outlook probably isn\u2019t very good.\nIt\u2019s an even more substantial wave of job cuts than Sonos made back in August, when it let 100 people go. The company remains in an unenviable position, facing cooling demand for its products and a reputation that has been badly tarnished by last year\u2019s app controversy. The situation eventually became so damaging to Sonos\u2019 business that it led to the ouster of former CEO Patrick Spence last month.\nConrad has pledged to continue improving the mobile app after the company carelessly released a major overhaul of the software back in May \u2014 well before it was actually ready for Sonos customers. The new app was buggy out of the gate and missing many features. Sonos has spent the months since trying to make up for its colossal misstep. But another round of layoffs at the company could further harm morale among employees who are still doing their best to rectify the mistakes of previous leadership.\nSonos will now divide its product organization into groups for hardware, software, design, quality and operations \u201cand away from dedicated business units devoted to individual product categories,\u201d Conrad wrote. \u201cBeing smaller and more focused will require us to do a much better job of prioritizing our work \u2014 lately we\u2019ve let too many projects run under a cloud of half-commitment. We\u2019re going to fix this too,\u201d he added.\nAfter releasing the well-received Arc Ultra soundbar late last year, Sonos\u2019 next planned hardware release is a high-end streaming player that doubles as an HDMI switch, among other capabilities.\nMost Popular\n- Is AI the end of software engineering or the next step in its evolution?\n- Chatbots can be manipulated through flattery and peer pressure\n- Dolby Vision 2 goes beyond HDR with more AI and \u2018authentic motion\u2019 smoothing\n- AI agents are science fiction not yet ready for primetime\n- The 20 best Labor Day deals you can grab for $100 or less"

      "text": "March 5 2024\nBird cuts jobs due to AI efficiency\nIn a striking development that underscores the relentless march of technological advancement, Bird, formerly known as Messagebird, an Amsterdam-based tech powerhouse, has recently made headlines by laying off 20 percent of its workforce. This bold move, affecting 90 of its 450 employees, was announced by the company's CEO, Robert Vis, citing automation and artificial intelligence (AI) as the driving forces enabling the company to achieve more with fewer people.\nFounded in 2011 by Vis and Adriaan Mol (also the founder of Mollie, another Amsterdam-based payment company), Bird has rapidly ascended to the ranks of the most valuable Dutch tech companies, with a valuation soaring over 3 billion euros after a funding round of 830 million euros in 2021. Despite its profitability, with last year's revenues hitting 582 million euros, Bird has seen its workforce more than halved since 2022, a trend reflective of the broader tech industry's response to economic pressures and the transformative potential of AI.\nThe recent layoffs at Bird highlight a crucial turning point, not only for the company but for the tech industry at large. As businesses increasingly turn to AI to streamline operations and cut costs, the implications for the workforce are profound. Robert Vis attributes this strategic shift to the \"promising results\" with AI, suggesting a future where technology can significantly augment or even replace human labor in certain tasks.\nMoreover, Bird's decision to slash prices for its communication services by 40 to 90 percent, thanks to AI-driven efficiencies, indicates a broader ambition to stay competitive and possibly prepare for future acquisitions. The mention of a potential move to acquire its larger American rival, Twilio, points to Bird's aggressive growth strategy and the pivotal role AI plays in its execution.\nThis scenario presents a rich ground for discussion about the role of AI in reshaping the future of work, the ethical considerations of automation, and how companies like Bird are navigating the delicate balance between innovation and employment. As AI continues to evolve, its impact on job markets, business models, and competitive strategies will undoubtedly remain a topic of keen interest and debate among industry watchers, policymakers, and the workforce alike.\nThe text in this article has been published in a different format on NRC.nl\nVergelijkbaar >\nSimilar news items\nAugust 22\nAI outwrites bestselling fantasy authors in short story challenge\nread more >\nAugust 22\nAI assistance may reduce doctors\u2019 diagnostic sharpness\nread more >\nAugust 22\nAI supports more diverse news exposure and healthier public debate\nread more >"

      "text": "Valued at $26 billion, Australia-founded Canva unveiled big business-friendly software updates to its 185 million monthly users as CEO Melanie Perkins heralded \u201cthe year of work.\u201d\nCanva is going corporate. With 185 million active users, a $26 billion valuation and annual recurring revenue of about $2.3 billion, the eleven year old design software company is already too big to be considered a startup challenger in a traditional sense.\nAlready used by most of the largest companies in the U.S., it was Canva\u2019s expansion past a narrow focus on design into workplaces tools that helped it nearly double its user base in the last 18 months. At the company\u2019s annual event for customers and press on Thursday \u2013 held for the first time outside of its native Australia in Los Angeles, and attended, the company claimed, by 2 million users online Canva announced an overhaul of their software suite to accelerate its spread through the enterprise.\nIf last year\u2019s changes to Canva were all about generative AI, this year\u2019s message is simple, cofounder and CEO Melanie Perkins said in an interview: \u201cthe year of work.\u201d FedEx cut brand review submissions for its marketing materials by 75% using Canva, the company claimed; Expedia saves 160 hours a week using its tools. And Workday estimated it\u2019s saved 33,000 work hours in aggregate by not having to create materials from scratch.\nThat last number gave even Perkins pause. \u201cI was like, \u2018is that real?\u2019 That\u2019s a really large number,\u201d she told Forbes. \u201cWe double-clicked a few times, and yes, it was.\u201d\nLaunched as a simple tool to easily create online design assets, Canva was already used by about 20 million people when it launched its first enterprise suite in 2019, as detailed in a Forbes cover story. Since then, it\u2019s methodically added features intended to appear to larger companies one by one, from user permissions to brand asset management and higher security standards.\nCanva\u2019s new product features continue that push, allowing companies to customize the tools to their organization by pinning certain design templates and other documents to each employee\u2019s workspace, deepening its comments system and making it easier to search across team-produced content. Canva is also offering packages of templates for different job functions like human resources, marketing and sales.\nAccording to Perkins, Canva\u2019s releases reflect the desire from largest customers to consolidate the number of tools they use. While Canva still connects with every major work software tool you\u2019d expect, companies are becoming sensitive to the amount of data and intellectual property they\u2019re hosting across disparate tools, she said.\nThat need has increased recently with the proliferation of generative AI tools used for a range of work outputs from social sharing images to sales presentations and online training courses. (Canva claimed its own Magic Studio AI tools have been used 6.5 billion times since their October launch, though a company spokesperson declined to comment on how many distinct users that number reflected.)\n\u201cVisual communication has really become the status quo across all parts of a company,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cAnd organizational complexity has also radically compounded.\u201d\nCanva\u2019s evolution is reminiscent of other popular productivity tools. It can produce smart documents, for example, as can Zoom, originally an online video conferencing tool that now offers messaging, whiteboarding and a number of other features popularized by other startups. Years earlier, work communications app Slack made a similar platform push.\nIn March, Canva acquired a popular tool for professional graphic designers, Affinity, that squared it off more directly with creative software rival Adobe. Now it will offer that software to nonprofits, students and teachers for free, as has been the policy for the rest of Canva. (The company says it works with more than 600,000 nonprofits and 60 million students and teachers.) \u201cDesign is definitely still at the heart of things,\u201d Perkins said.\nIncreasingly, Canva\u2019s offering a little bit of everything, more like a mature enterprise software company (and one that could eventually trade on the public market), and less the narrowly focused challenger. \u201cWe are seeing a lot of desire\u201d for a consolidated platform, Perkins said. \u201cAt the same time, Canva can\u2019t and won\u2019t do everything.\u201d\nBut Canva will inevitably keep trying to do more things for a wider swath of a company\u2019s job functions, with its updated Enterprise offering likely another milestone in the process of growing-up. That \u2013 and the ability to adapt to user demands \u2013 is how Canva reaches its CEO\u2019s bigger ambition, as Perkins put it: \u201cThe goal is to get to a billion people using Canva each month.\u201d"

The first he lists is 391 people being cut for \u201cstrategy\u201d reasons.\nThe second and biggest bucket, 460 people, is for \u201cperformance\u201d reasons, with Dorsey explaining that Block is laying off employees who score a \u201cbelow\u201d rating on the company\u2019s internal performance tracking metrics, or were trending towards it.\nThe third bucket is managers, 80 of whom are being cut in order to flatten Block\u2019s hierarchy to \u201cinnercore+4,\u201d which refers to Dorsey\u2019s direct reports and then four levels of direct reports beyond that, according to a source familiar. Dorsey also said that 193 managers are being moved to individual contributor roles.\nDorsey\u2019s email denies that the layoffs are for financial reasons or to replace workers with AI.

      "text": "Online abuse, disinformation, fraud and other malicious content is growing and getting more complex to track. Today, a startup called ActiveFence is coming out of the shadows to announce significant funding on the back of a surge of large organizations using its services. ActiveFence has quietly built a tech platform to suss out threats as they are being formed and planned to make it easier for trust and safety teams to combat them on platforms.\nThe startup, co-headquartered in New York and Tel Aviv, has raised $100 million, funding that it will use to continue developing its tools and to continue expanding its customer base. To date, ActiveFence says that its customers include companies in social media, audio and video streaming, file sharing, gaming, marketplaces and other technologies \u2014 it has yet to disclose any specific names but says that its tools collectively cover \u201cbillions\u201d of users. Governments and brands are two other categories that it is targeting as it continues to expand. It has been around since 2018 and is growing at around 100% annually.\nThe $100 million being announced today actually covers two rounds: Its most recent Series B led by CRV and Highland Europe, as well as a Series A it never announced led by Grove Ventures and Norwest Venture Partners. Vintage Investment Partners, Resolute Ventures and other unnamed backers also participated. It\u2019s not disclosing valuation but I understand it\u2019s over $500 million.\n\u201cWe are very honored to be ActiveFence partners from the very earliest days of the company, and to be part of this important journey to make the internet a safer place and see their unprecedented success with the world\u2019s leading internet platforms,\u201d said Lotan Levkowitz, general partner at Grove Ventures, in a statement.\nThe increased presence of social media and online chatter on other platforms has put a strong spotlight on how those forums are used by bad actors to spread malicious content. ActiveFence\u2019s particular approach is a set of algorithms that tap into innovations in AI (natural language processing) and to map relationships between conversations. It crawls all of the obvious, and less obvious and harder-to-reach parts of the internet to pick up on chatter that is typically where a lot of the malicious content and campaigns are born \u2014 some 3 million sources in all \u2014 before they become higher-profile issues. It\u2019s built both on the concept of big data analytics as well as understanding that the long tail of content online has a value if it can be tapped effectively.\n\u201cWe take a fundamentally different approach to trust, safety and content moderation,\u201d Noam Schwartz, the co-founder and CEO, said in an interview. \u201cWe are proactively searching the darkest corners of the web and looking for bad actors in order to understand the sources of malicious content. Our customers then know what\u2019s coming. They don\u2019t need to wait for the damage, or for internal research teams to identify the next scam or disinformation campaign. We work with some of the most important companies in the world, but even tiny, super niche platforms have risks.\u201d\nThe insights that ActiveFence gathers are then packaged up in an API that its customers can then feed into whatever other systems they use to track or mitigate traffic on their own platforms.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Factmata has built algorithms to better understand and track sentiments online; Primer (which also recently raised a big round) also uses NLP to help its customers track online information, with its customers including government organizations that used its technology to track misinformation during election campaigns; Bolster (formerly called RedMarlin) is another.\nSome of the bigger platforms have also gotten more proactive in bringing tracking technology and talent in-house: Facebook acquired Bloomsbury AI several years ago for this purpose; Twitter has acquired Fabula (and is working on a bigger efforts like Birdwatch to build better tools), and earlier this year Discord picked up Sentropy, another online abuse tracker. In some cases, companies that more regularly compete against each other for eyeballs and dollars are even teaming up to collaborate on efforts.\nIndeed, it may well be that ultimately there will exist multiple efforts and multiple companies doing good work in this area, not unlike other corners of the world of security, which might need more than one hammer thrown at problems to crack them. In this particular case, the growth of the startup to date, and its effectiveness in identifying early warning signs, is one reason investors have been interested in ActiveFence.\n\u201cWe are pleased to support ActiveFence in this important mission,\u201d commented Izhar Armony, a general partner at CRV, in a statement. \u201cWe believe they are ready for the next phase of growth and that they can maintain leadership in the dynamic and fast-growing trust and safety market.\u201d\n\u201cActiveFence has emerged as a clear leader in the developing online trust and safety category. This round will help the company to accelerate the growth momentum we witnessed in the past few years,\u201d said Dror Nahumi, general partner at Norwest Venture Partners, in a statement.\nTo guard against data loss and misuse, the cybersecurity conversation must evolve"

It raised a total of $9 million, Buckland told BI in April. Its investors include venture capital firms like Stellation Capital, Cowboy Ventures, Chai Ventures, and others.\nThe company's first product was Landing, a social media app that felt nostalgic for the 2010s days of Polyvore or Pinterest, and was a brief hit with Gen-Z users. The startup shut down the Landing app in September.\nThe company then rebranded to Zeen and pivoted away from building a new social media platform and toward the creator economy. It introduced a shoppable collage feature that creators could use across social media platforms, particularly Substack newsletters. Creators could easily integrate affiliate-marketing links using Zeen's website.\n\"We've had products in many different iterations through Landing and through Zeen, and we hoped that this would be something that we could grow into a much bigger business,\" Buckland said.\nBuilding a long-lasting, profitable social media platform isn't an easy game. That's one reason some investors have backed away from the category.\nOther social media darlings have faced fates of either dwindling popularity or, in some cases, shutting down entirely. For instance, Poparazzi, a photo-sharing app that was a viral hit in 2021, announced it would shut down in 2023. Meanwhile, some creator economy startups have also had to face shutdowns, like film studio Creator+.\n\"We made the decision that now was the time to shut it down,\" Buckland said. \"Fundraising or becoming profitable, they weren't viable pathways for us at this point. It's a sad decision, honestly.\""

The cuts would affect 6% of Recruit\u2019s HR technology division.\nHighlighting internal figures that AI helps people find a job every 2.2 seconds, the company said in a statement that it is focusing on \u201csimplifying hiring by building a better job seeker and employer experience using AI.\u201d\n\u201cAI is changing the world, and we must adapt by ensuring our product delivers truly great experiences for job seekers and employers,\u201d Idekoba wrote in the memo.\nAs part of the restructuring, Glassdoor\u2019s current CEO, Christian Sutherland-Wong, is leaving the company on October 1. LaFawn Davis, chief people and sustainability officer at Indeed, is also leaving the company.\nThe job cuts come as tech companies across the world roll back their sustainability initiatives and cut jobs to balance out extensive spending on integrating AI into their businesses. Tens of thousands of people stand to lose jobs at Microsoft, TikTok, Match, Intel, and Meta, per announcements in just the past couple of months.\nUpdated with additional details from the company memo."

      "text": "Wayfair is exiting the German market and plans to cut as many as 730 jobs, or about 3% of its global workforce, as it looks to focus on new growth drivers such as physical retail, the company said Friday.\nAbout half of the affected employees will have the option to stay on with Wayfair if they agree to relocate to London, Boston or other locations where the company has a presence, finance chief Kate Gulliver told CNBC in an interview. The affected positions include corporate roles as well as roles on Wayfair's customer service and warehouse teams, she said.\nIn a memo to employees shared with CNBC, founder and CEO Niraj Shah said it would take too much time and money for Wayfair to expand its business in Germany and the company's dollars would be better used for other growth initiatives.\n\"Scaling our market share and improving our unit economics in the German market has proven challenging due to factors such as the weak macroeconomic conditions for our category in Germany, the lower maturity of our offering, our current brand awareness, and our limited scale,\" wrote Shah.\n\"In our recent assessment, we concluded that achieving market-leading growth in Germany remained a long and costly endeavor, and one that is increasingly lagging the potential return we see in other areas. To ensure we align our resources with initiatives that can deliver the greatest impact, we made the difficult but necessary decision to reallocate efforts to areas with strong long-term potential where our current efforts are showing great progress,\" he wrote.\nShares fell about 3% in early trading Friday.\nGermany, where Wayfair has been operating for 15 years, makes up a \"low single digit percentage\" of Wayfair's revenue, customers and orders, Gulliver said. The restructuring is expected to cost between $102 million and $111 million, which includes $40 million to $44 million in employee-related costs like severance, benefits, relocation and transition costs and around $62 million to $67 million in non-cash charges related to facility closures and other wind-down activities, Wayfair said in a securities filing.\nThe company expects to make those payments over the next 12 months, but they are expected to be incurred across the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 \u2014 a six-month period set to conclude at the end of March.\nWayfair expects to reinvest any savings from restructuring mostly across other core initiatives, such as its physical retail plans and its remaining international markets, it said in a securities filing. The company's guidance isn't changing, said Gulliver.\nFriday's layoffs are the fourth that Wayfair has implemented since summer 2022, but this move is less about cost savings and more about reallocating resources to initiatives that are actually making the company money, said Gulliver.\n\"We're not doing this because we're saying that we need some, you know, cost efficiency play, and so therefore we had to look for more costs and we identified Germany,\" said Gulliver. \"We see better ROI initiatives that we are already further along on that we can continue to invest in. So it's an investment prioritization, and [we're] going after areas like the U.K., Canada, etc. where we see a really exciting opportunity.\"\nThose initiatives include Wayfair's foray into physical retail, which began in earnest in May when it opened its first namesake store outside Chicago. Since the location opened, the company has enjoyed what Gulliver described as a \"halo effect,\" where online sales to customers who live near the store have increased. It plans to open another store or two in the U.S. \"in short order\" and also hopes to expand those doors to international markets such as Canada and the U.K., said Gulliver.\n\"Obviously, we want to nail it in the U.S. first,\" said Gulliver. \"But we are excited about the potential over time.\"\nStill, physical retail can be a massive capital expenditure. And Wayfair hasn't turned an annual net profit since 2020.\nWayfair's decision comes as the company looks to boost topline growth in a sluggish housing market that has dampened demand for all things home. In the three months ended Sept. 30, sales fell 2% to $2.9 billion.\n\"It's always difficult to make a decision that impacts humans,\" she said. \"We care very deeply about the team there, and we're so appreciative of their work, but we do believe that this is the right next step for the business to allow us to focus on these higher ROI priorities.\""

      "text": "Australian tech company Atlassian has cut 150 staff members in a pre-recorded video message delivered by co-founder and CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes early this morning. Customer service and support roles will be impacted in the cuts, with some of their tasks now set to be done by artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe startling video message came hours before co-founder and billionaire Scott Farquhar heralded Australia's AI revolution in an Australian Press Club address. The former co-CEO said Australia needs to let go of \"jobs from the past\" and said those impacted by shifts can lean on the nations \"very strong social safety net\".\nThe duo founded the software company Atlassian in 2002 and have been labelled Australia's first tech billionaires.\nCannon-Brookes sent the video to impacted staff on Wednesday morning, with the title \u2018Restructuring the CSS Team: A Difficult Decision for Our Future\u2019. Employees weren\u2019t told about their jobs before the announcement and reportedly had to wait 15 minutes to find out their fate over email before their laptops were immediately blocked.\nAtlassian declined to comment when approached by Yahoo Finance but confirmed it had made the \u201chard decision\u201d to let a small cohort of customer service and support employees go.\nIt\u2019s understood the decision was made following improvements to customer experience across the company\u2019s platform and tools, which meant there was a significant reduction in support needs. It has disputed the claim that the jobs will be \u201creplaced by AI\u201d.\nAccording to The Australian, Cannon-Brookes told affected staff the company\u2019s customer service team had become a victim of the business\u2019s broader success.\nLarger clients had been moved off the older software platform and into the cloud, reducing the volume of complex support tasks required.\nHe noted future complaints would more likely be treated in part with AI.\nIt's understood impacted staff are being consulted and offered a minimum of 12 weeks' pay.\nThe bank introduced a new chatbot system to answer customer inquiries in June and said it had reduced the volume of calls by 2,000 a week.\n'I worry about jobs of the past': Atlassian co-founder spruiks AI\nThe lay-offs came the same day as former co-CEO and co-founder Scott Farquhar spruiked the benefits of AI to the National Press Club.\nHe expressed concerns about not finding a way to evolve with new technologies and said Australians can lean on government support while \"re-skilling\".\n\"I do worry if, as a nation, we want to stick to and have jobs of the past,\" Farquhar said on Wednesday.\n\"That is not a good plan for us.\"\nThe billionaire co-founder warned: \"There will be job changes across the industry as a result of this\".\n\u201cIn these times or any time we should be helping our employees to make the transition bracket at company level but also at a national level,\" he said.\n\u201cParticularly in Australia, I feel very privileged and blessed that we live in a nation that has a very strong social safety net and very strong skill and opportunities for our people to re-skill into new areas.\n\"Every nation in the world will go through the same thing and compared to other nations and I think we\u2019re well placed for that.\u201d\nFarquhar, who stepped down from his role last year, called for the government to enable the construction of more data centres in Australia and renewable energy to power them.\nHe said Australia had an opportunity to become a major regional centre for AI infrastructure by housing data centres.\nSpeaking on ABC Breakfast this morning, Farquhar also said every company should be embracing AI.\n\u201cEvery person should be using AI daily for as many things as they can,\u201d he said.\n\u201cLike any new technology, it will feel awkward to start with, but every business person, every business leader, every government leader and every bureaucrat should be using it.\u201d\nUnions push for tougher regulation on use of AI\nEarlier this year, technology sector union Professionals Australia reported an influx of workers from the multi-billion dollar industry joining amid AI-fuelled \"uncertainty\" about their job security.\nProfessionals Australia director Paul Inglis told Yahoo Finance it was a \"devastating day for Atlassian employees\", with 44 of the global job cuts based in Australia.\n\"Atlassian has confirmed that these roles are being made redundant due to the impact of artificial intelligence,\" he said.\n\"This development speaks to our growing concerns about the pace and nature of AI integration in the workplace and the very real consequences it is already having on Australian jobs.\n\"These job losses highlight the need for urgent national discussion on the responsible deployment of AI, and the safeguards that must be in place to protect workers, their livelihoods and the future of high-skilled, high-value employment in Australia\u2019s tech sector.\"\nFollowing the announcement of dozens of Australians losing their job to AI automisation, the Finance Sector Union (FSU) said the use of new technology must be done in partnership with workers, not at their expense.\n\u201cThere is a human cost to this. You can\u2019t just replace frontline jobs with a voice bot and expect the same service for customers,\" FSU national secretary Julia Angrisano said.\nThe Australian Council of Trade Unions said it would use next month\u2019s Economic Reform Roundtable to call for a new set of mandatory enforceable agreements that would force employers to consult with staff before new AI technologies can be introduced into workplaces.\nEmployers would be required to reach agreements around guarantees for job security, skills development and retraining, transparency over technology use, privacy and data collection and use protections.\n\u201cWe can realise the potential productivity benefits of AI while protecting the Australian fair go in the AI age,\u201d ACTU assistant secretary Joseph Mitchell said.\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t wish away the major disruptions and social risks that the bad use of AI and other new tech poses, through massive job losses and the theft of creative and intellectual property by big tech companies.\u201d"

Amazon said it continues to hire within the devices and services division.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy has been on a mission to trim costs across the company, laying off 27,000 employees since the beginning of 2022. Job reductions have continued this year, though at a smaller scale than in preceding years. The devices and services organization experienced layoffs in 2022 and 2023.\nLast year, as part of its return-to-office push, Amazon moved to simplify its corporate structure by having fewer managers in order to \"remove layers and flatten organizations.\" Jassy set a goal to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of this year.\nOther major technology companies have also continued to trim their workforces. Microsoft on Tuesday said it would lay off roughly 6,000 employees as it looks to reduce layers of management."

      "text": "General Fusion laid off at least 25% of its employees last week, just days after hitting a key milestone for its latest fusion demonstration device.\nCEO Greg Twinney posted an open letter on the company\u2019s website Monday saying that while its new LM26 device had been able to compress a plasma \u2014 something necessary for fusion conditions \u2014 General Fusion was running short of money. He wrote, \u201c[T]oday\u2019s funding landscape is more challenging than ever as investors and governments navigate a rapidly shifting and uncertain political and market climate.\u201d\nThe 23-year-old company, which many still describe as a startup, is Canada\u2019s leading entrant in the race for commercial fusion power. It has raised $440 million, according to PitchBook, including a $22.66 million round that closed in July. Backers include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, and BDC Capital. But that money hasn\u2019t been enough for the company to show that its unique approach to fusion is viable.\nGeneral Fusion\u2019s plight highlights the challenges that face the fusion industry.\nTo date, only one device has been able to hit so-called scientific breakeven, a milestone that\u2019s significant historically but not commercially. To hit commercial breakeven, reactors need to produce dozens of times more energy than has been demonstrated so far.\nThe road to those milestones has proven extraordinarily costly. Though General Fusion\u2019s tally may seem impressive, it is middle of the pack. Commonwealth Fusion Systems has raised over $2 billion, Helion has pulled in over $1 billion, and upstart Pacific Fusion has been pledged $900 million in its Series A alone.\nPart of General Fusion\u2019s challenge is that it\u2019s taking a different approach than many of its competitors.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

The former uses magnetic fields to control plasma, squeezing it until it reaches the conditions for nuclei to fuse. The latter approach typically uses lasers to compress a fuel pellet.\nGeneral Fusion, on the other hand, has been trying to use steam-driven pistons to compress fusion fuel. The U.S. Navy tried something similar in the 1970s to no avail, but General Fusion thinks that modern computers could solve some of the timing problems that plagued earlier attempts. It has yet to show that\u2019s the case, but it has said that if completed, LM26 should be able to reach scientific breakeven.\nNow the company will have to raise more money \u2014 and quickly \u2014 if it wants to prove its approach is a viable competitor."

The layoffs affect the development teams behind two of its titles: Best Fiends and Redecor. This follows a similar move two weeks ago, when Wooga, a Playtika subsidiary, laid off around 50 employees.\nThe current layoffs appear to be linked to the underperformance of the affected games. Revenue for Best Fiends has declined sharply, from $8 million per month in March 2022 to only about $3 million in May 2025.\nIn 2021, Playtika acquired Finnish gaming studio Reworks, the developer of Redecor, in a deal valued at $600 million. The acquisition was intended to strengthen Playtika\u2019s position in the design games segment, a genre that had been growing in popularity in the mobile gaming market. Redecor, a simulation-based interior design game, was considered a leader in its category. However, Playtika has since struggled to integrate Reworks into its operations, and all of the studio\u2019s founders departed within two years of the acquisition.\nDespite these challenges, Playtika reported record revenue of $706 million in the first quarter of 2025, representing an 8.4% increase year-over-year. However, net profit fell sharply to just $30.6 million, a 42% drop from the same period in 2024. The company\u2019s profit margins also contracted significantly, from 8.1% last year to 4.3% this year.\nPlaytika is currently traded on the Nasdaq with a market valuation of $1.83 billion."

What remains of Cruise will move under parent company General Motors as the automaker directs its resources toward improving its hands-free driver assistance system Super Cruise \u2014 and eventually rolls out personal autonomous vehicles.\nThe layoffs were announced by Craig Glidden, Cruise\u2019s president and chief administrative officer, according to a companywide email that TechCrunch has viewed and verified with sources. Individuals who were affected received a separate email from Cruise Chief Human Resources Officer Nilka Thomas.\nCEO Marc Whitten will depart from Cruise this week, along with Thomas, Chief Safety Officer Steve Kenner, and Global Head of Public Policy Rob Grant.\nMo Elshenawy, Cruise\u2019s chief technologist, will stay on through the end of April to help with the transition.\n\u201cAs a result of the change in strategy we announced in December, today we will part with nearly 50% of our Cruise employee base, through a reduction in force,\u201d the email from Glidden reads. \u201cAnyone who has been through a reduction knows that days like this are extremely difficult, and today is no different. With our move away from the ride-hail business and toward providing autonomous vehicles to customers alongside GM, our staffing and resource needs have dramatically changed. Today\u2019s actions align our teams to our new needs, and focus our efforts on continuing to build world-class AV technology.\u201d\nAs of January 2024, Cruise employed about 2,100 people, according to sources who based the estimates on the number of members on a Slack channel for company announcements. That means more than 1,000 employees might have been impacted by the layoffs.\n\u201cCruise shared the difficult decision to part ways with approximately 50% of its workforce,\u201d the company wrote in an emailed statement. \u201cWe are grateful for their passion and contributions to help us reach this stage, and our focus is on supporting them into their next chapter with severance packages and career support.

Cruise is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of GM.\nAll employees who were laid off will remain on the company\u2019s payroll through April 5 and receive benefits through the end of April. Affected workers will receive eight weeks of severance pay and benefits. Long-term employees will be offered another two weeks of pay and benefits for every full year of employment over three years. All employees will also receive three months of company-paid COBRA coverage, as well as a Linkedin Premium subscription for a year to support their job search.\nThe layoffs come nearly two months after GM said it would no longer fund the development of a commercial robotaxi business and would instead focus on building personal autonomous vehicle technology.\nThe automaker expects to save up to $1 billion annually by ending its Cruise robotaxi development program, according to details shared during the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call. At the time, CFO Paul Jacobson said the projected cost savings were based on the assumption that \u201cCruise employees will be fully integrated into GM by mid-year.\u201d\nIn mid-January, Cruise management started to extend retention offers to employees, almost all of whom were engineers, according to sources familiar with the matter. In an email to Cruise employees, CEO Marc Whitten indicated that next steps would come after the Cruise board met. That meeting happened on Monday, according to one source.\nWhile Cruise employees were initially blindsided by GM\u2019s decision to pull the plug on the robotaxi development program, they have been expecting such an announcement for weeks.\nSources who spoke to TechCrunch said they have been hardly working and in a state of limbo since GM\u2019s announcement as they awaited next steps. On Monday afternoon, Glidden sent a Slack message to employees saying that he expects to share \u201csome news regarding the transition plans tomorrow\u201d and advised staffers to \u201cplan on working from home.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for your patience during this time \u2013 we know the uncertainty has been difficult but you have navigated the past weeks with grace and professionalism,\u201d Glidden wrote.\nGlidden had previously served as GM\u2019s executive vice president of legal and policy, but the automaker assigned him his role at Cruise in November 2023, following a Cruise safety incident that led to the company\u2019s downfall.\nOn October 2, 2023, a Cruise robotaxi ran over a pedestrian who had been flung into its path by a human-driven vehicle. The robotaxi then dragged the pedestrian, who was stuck under the car, some 20 feet as it attempted a pullover maneuver.\nCruise officials did not immediately share that relevant bit of information with authorities, and when it was revealed, California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles and Public Utilities Commission immediately suspended the company\u2019s permits to operate. Cruise then grounded its entire robotaxi fleet across the U.S., and much of its leadership team stepped down, including co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt.\nAfter installing new leadership, including a permanent chief safety officer, Cruise was gearing up for a relaunch at the start of this year in Austin. The company had spent much of 2024 testing in Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, and the Bay Area and beefing out its safety systems. Two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch the company had been ready to implement a retrofitted sensor solution internally referred to as Project Rhino that would have solved for the October 2 incident by creating additional visibility and awareness underneath the car.\nIn June 2024, GM injected another $850 million into Cruise, bringing its total spend on the company since acquiring most of Cruise\u2019s shares in 2016 close to $10 billion. In September, Elshenawy, president and chief technologist of Cruise, threw a huge party for Cruise staffers that some read to be a sign that the company was moving forward.\nAn earlier version included a statement from Cruise that put the layoff count at 40%. Cruise later corrected their statement to reflect Glidden\u2019s email, which said nearly 50% of workers would be laid off."

NetApp remains committed to supporting its employees, customers, and stakeholders during this transition and is taking thoughtful steps to ensure the company is positioned to meet future demands and deliver sustainable value.\u201d\nWe have been told of a 6 percent workforce cut, which would equate to around 700 people.\nNetApp already warned of layoffs of at least 4 percent in its financial report for the nine months ended January 2025, stating: \u201cIn the first nine months of fiscal 2025, management approved restructuring plans to redirect resources to highest return activities and reduce costs, which included a reduction of our global workforce by approximately 4 percent. \u2026 The activities under the plans are expected to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2025.\u201d\nThe company found itself facing sales deal slippage in its Q3 of fiscal 2025, which ended January 24, 2025. It had hoped to pull in $1.68 billion \u00b1 $75 million in revenues, a 4 percent year-over-year rise at the midpoint, and NetApp was inside that range with $1.64 billion, a 2 percent year-on-year rise.\nThe fourth quarter outlook is for revenues of $1.725 billion \u00b1 $75 million, a 3.3 percent increase on a year ago at the midpoint. NetApp is taking action to lower its costs early, before the quarter ends, in order to boost profitability or reduce its losses.\nServer maker Supermicro has just warned it will miss estimated revenues for its Q3 of fiscal 2025, citing deal slippage and higher inventory costs after older generation product sales missed expectations.\nSupermicro has had its own accounting problems, but its issues could reflect a cooling AI server market. That, if true, could also be affecting NetApp. It may equally be affected by President Trump\u2019s tariff changes.\nIn the storage field, Lightbits and ExaGrid have both recently posted good growth stories.
