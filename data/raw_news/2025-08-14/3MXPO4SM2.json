  "title": "Google Reportedly Working on a Mysterious 'Magic View' for NotebookLM",
  "description": "It's anyone's guess as to what the feature will actually do, and don't expect it immediately.",
  "content": "Google is continually expanding or strengthening the features for NotebookLM, its free AI-powered research assistant. An upcoming feature codenamed Magic View should be landing --eventually -- in the Studio panel, alongside popular features like Audio and Video Overviews.\n\nAt the moment, there's no clear indication as to what Magic View is or will do when it formally arrives in NotebookLM, but it's clear that Google continues improving what I'd consider its best AI tool available today.\n\nA representative for Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe leak comes from AI news site, Testing Catalog, which has spotted several upcoming NotebookLM features through feature flag analysis and code review.\n\nAlthough we had been expecting them for some time, Google officially released Video Overviews in late July, bringing a more visual approach to its successful Audio Overview feature that has since expanded into several other products in the tech giant's portfolio. Whatever the actual function of the upcoming Magic View turns out to be, it appears to continue Google's effort to visualize your data sources in one way or another.\n\nA screenshot grabbed by Testing Catalog shows Magic View as a dotted grid with plot points filled in with different colors. If you remember the kids' toy, Lite Brite, it sort of looks like that but with a larger grid. What the plot points represent could be an assortment of potential things, but we'll hold any specific guesses until the picture becomes more clear. It wouldn't at all be surprising if this Magic View is focused around learning or something aimed at students, as this is where NotebookLM shines.\n\nLike most features within the Studio panel of NotebookLM, this Magic View will be a feature you can optionally generate and it appears that it'll be nestled under a Notebook Apps dropdown, which is also new. When they arrive, we'd also expect flash cards and interactive quizzes to find a home here, too.\n\nThere's no date for the release, of course, since nothing has been announced. But don't expect it soon. We would likely have a better idea of its function within the code if it was built out further. Since it's not, the feature is likely in early development.\n\nFor more, don't miss the 11 things for which you should stop using ChatGPT.",

      "text": "The next time you wonder why school buses are yellow, you might not have to read a single word to get the answer. Google's latest experimental feature can literally tell you the answer, in a tiny audio clip that loads right to your results page.\nLaunched Friday in Search Labs, Audio Overviews uses Google's latest Gemini AI models to turn certain queries into 30- to 45-second, podcast-style explainers, complete with on-screen source links for fact-checking.\nThe move pushes Google's AI Overviews beyond text, positioning Search for a semi-hands-free, voice-first future, while also raising more questions about what this means for publishers who rely on clicks.\nHow you can try out Audio Overviews right now\nIf you're interested, you can try out Google's Audio Overviews right now. Go to the Google Labs website, opt in to the Search Labs program if you're not already signed up and toggle on Audio Overviews.\nThe next time you run a query, like \"How do I stop apps from tracking my exact location on my iPhone,\" Google might show you a button that says Generate Audio Overview, which you'll have to scroll down a little to see.\nYou can then tap on the Audio Overview to process the clip, and then press play. You can speed up the audio, mute the clip and also rate it with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down to better train it.\nBelow the player, Google lists the web pages it drew from, so you can click through to fact-check the information or just dig deeper.\nFor those with visual impairments, this new feature offers a glimpse at what a voice-first Google might look like. But until Google expands language support and proves the summaries are dependable, consider this a nifty experiment for now, not a substitute for reading the full story."

      "text": "Back its I/O conference in May, Google announced that it would be adding Video Overviews to NotebookLM, with the new features \"coming soon.\" Now these features are being rolled out, according to a Keyword blog post on Tuesday.\nNotebookLM is an incredibly easy to use, powerful AI tool that can distill dense pieces of information into more digestible material. Features like Audio Overviews, and now, Video Overviews, offer deep dives into topics covered by source materials.\nAlong with the Video Overviews, NotebookLM redesigned its Studio Panel and added more features that will allow you to stretch your information further into your specific areas of interest. For more, don't miss our coverage of NotebookLM's new curated selection of featured notebooks.\nVideo Overviews start as slides, with more formats to come\nGoogle's blog post says the new Video Overviews rolling out represent the first presentation format, which hints that more types will become available in the future. For now, the overviews take the form of narrated slides.\nVideo Overviews pull in images, diagrams, quotes and other data points from your documents to provide a visual representation of your sources. These visual aids can make it even easier to grasp complex topics.\nLike Audio Overviews, you'll be able to use the \"customize\" section to direct Video Overviews in any way you see fit. Whether you're seeking a general overview that touches on the core themes or a deep dive dedicated to a specific section of your sources, you'll be able to fine-tune to your liking.\nVideo Overviews are rolling out to all English users, starting today, with additional languages on the way soon.\nNotebookLM's Studio Panel is redesigned and upgraded\nYou can think of the Studio panel as where all the NotebookLM magic happens. It's where you'll generate your Audio or Video Overviews, Mind Maps, Study Guides and more. It's now redesigned, and features a few additional tricks.\nThe redesign adds icons at the top of the panel to quickly generate what you want. Audio Overviews, Video Overviews and Mind Maps each have their own dedicated tiles, and a Reports tile tucks away Briefing Docs, Study Guides, FAQs and Timelines for a less cluttered feel. You can hover over any tile to select which option you want to generate from a drop-down menu.\nPrior to this update, you could only generate one of each type of studio output per notebook and you could only access the generated items one at a time. Now, you can create multiple study guides, FAQs and others within the same notebook.\nGoogle describes some of the ways this new functionality could be useful:\n- Creating multiple Audio Overviews for a notebook in different languages.\n- Generating dedicated Audio and Video Overviews for specific roles in a team notebook with notes and documentation.\n- Making multiple Mind Maps, FAQs or study guides for each chapter for your next big exam.\nIn addition, you can now multitask within the Studio panel, allowing you to poke around in a Mind Map while listening to an Audio Overview.\nThe redesigned Studio panel will be rolling out to all users over the next few weeks.\nFor more on NotebookLM, here's how to make your notebooks public and share them."

      "text": "Google\u2019s NotebookLM continues to evolve as new features surface in early development stages. Recently, a code-named feature called Magic View was spotted. So far, when activated, it launches an animation that resembles a dynamic canvas or a Game of Life field, though there\u2019s no clear indication yet what its main function will be. This element could hint at a new type of interactive space or visual artifact that users can create, or it might serve as a completely new way to visualize or interact with notebook data. It\u2019s still too early to determine if Magic View will take the form of a game, an app, or something more experimental within NotebookLM.\nNotebookLM\u2019s main audience consists of students, educators, researchers, and anyone looking for advanced note-taking with AI assistance. This new Magic View feature, when released, would likely be found within the existing Notebook apps environment, potentially alongside the recently added flashcards and quizzes. The goal seems to be to make information exploration or creation more visually immersive or interactive, but the exact significance will only become clear as development progresses.\nAt the same time, Google is rolling out broader access to video overviews, enabling users to generate summaries in video format for their notebooks. The addition of a customization menu for selecting languages in these video overviews further reflects the product\u2019s focus on accessibility and internationalization.\nAs with previous updates, these discoveries were surfaced via feature flag analysis and code review, typical for early-stage Google experiments. Given the pace and approach of Google\u2019s recent updates to NotebookLM, it may be a while before Magic View is widely available. For now, users should watch for hints of expanded interactivity and visual storytelling within the app, as Google continues to align NotebookLM with broader trends in generative AI-powered productivity tools. The company\u2019s steady rollout of customizable, multimedia, and interactive options keeps NotebookLM in line with Google\u2019s strategy of making knowledge work both more powerful and more accessible."

      "text": "I started using Google's nifty NotebookLM to sort through and make sense of my documents, notes, and stray bits of information. Now, the AI tool is getting a new series of \"featured notebooks\" from a variety of sources for all of us to explore. Google announced the new feature on Monday, along with partnerships with respected publications to supply a curated collection of notebooks that will grow over time.\nNotebookLM is a unique and powerful notetaking and research tool, and it's my overall favorite piece of AI kit available. Google continues to introduce new features that make it into a powerhouse for learning and research that you can use for school, work, play or somewhere in between.\nHere's what you need to know about the new featured notebook collection. For more, don't miss how Google Lens can be your personal travel tour guide.\nA few featured notebooks for starters\nRight now, the collection of featured notebooks is somewhat limited, though it will grow as time goes on.\nThere are currently eight notebooks for you to explore:\n- Longevity advice from Eric Topol, bestselling author of Super Agers.\n- Expert analysis and predictions for 2025 as shared in The World Ahead annual report by The Economist.\n- An advice notebook based on bestselling author Arthur C. Brooks' How to Build A Life columns in The Atlantic.\n- A science fan's guide to visiting Yellowstone National Park, complete with geological explanations and biodiversity insights.\n- An overview of long-term trends in human well-being published by the University of Oxford-affiliated project, Our World In Data.\n- Science-backed parenting advice based on psychology professor Jacqueline Nesi's popular Substack newsletter, Techno Sapiens.\n- The complete works of William Shakespeare, for students and scholars to explore.\n- An exploration of first-quarter earnings reports from the top 50 public companies worldwide, for financial analysts and market watchers alike\nEach notebook allows you to explore the original sources, view a mind map, and listen to a pre-made Audio Overview. That's in addition to the ability to ask questions based on the sources in the chat, which is NotebookLM's simplest and most obvious use case.\nGoogle has partnered with both The Economist and The Atlantic, so you can expect to see additional collections of notebooks on the way from these publications.\nPublic notebooks made featured notebooks possible\nLast month, Google introduced the ability to mark your notebooks as public so you could share them with anyone you wanted to. Google said there have been over 140,000 public notebooks created. While that's a bit tough to assess without additional data points, the introduction of public notebooks paved the way for featured notebooks. Previously, your creations were available to you and only you, unless you'd upgraded to the premium version of NotebookLM.\nMore features on the way\nWe know of at least one more feature that NotebookLM will eventually offer, and that's Video Overviews. Audio Overviews are already great -- so much so that Google has added them to more of its products. The introduction of Video Overviews will definitely appeal to those who could easily tune out when listening to audio or are more visual learners.\nThere's no specific date attached to their arrival, outside of the \"coming soon\" timeline Google provided in a blog post during the Google I/O conference in May.\nThe AI- and web-focused tech site Testing Catalog has been ahead of the game when it comes to discovering new features or features that Google is testing for NotebookLM. Here's what else they've managed to spot that could be on the way.\nAI flashcards: You can already create study guides with NotebookLM, but a new feature that could be of great benefit to students is the ability to generate flashcards on the fly based on your content sources.\nDiscover sources via Google Drive: NotebookLM lets you find new sources in the Discover Sources section. You type in what you're looking for, and it scour the web for relevant content. Soon, that search may extend to Google Drive.\nInteractive Quizzes: Google's making NotebookLM a go-to assistant for students, and it might add interactive quizzes based on your sources.\nMicrosoft Word doc support: Right now, when you're trying to select a source from Google Drive, you can only choose between Google Docs or Google Slides. In the future, it appears that NotebookLM might gain support for adding Microsoft Word docs that are also in your Drive, too.\nFor more, don't miss the 11 things you should stop using ChatGPT for right now."

      "text": "There are a lot of things you can do with ChatGPT, and it seems like that list is getting longer everyday. The powerful LLM chatbot can help you create a budget, plan your meals for the week, reach your health goals and make writing or coding easier.\nBut you don't want to give ChatGPT carte blanche in your life. It's not great at everything -- in fact, it can be downright sketchy at a lot of things.\nChatGPT sometimes hallucinates information and passes it off as fact, and it may not always have up-to-date information. It's incredibly confident, even when it's straight up wrong. (The same can be said about other generative AI tools, too, of course.)\nThat matters the higher the stakes get, like when taxes, medical bills, court dates or bank balances enter the chat. If you're unsure about when turning to ChatGPT might be risky, here are 11 scenarios when you should put down the AI and choose another option. Don't use ChatGPT for any of the following.\n(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, the parent company of CNET, in April filed a lawsuit against ChatGPT maker OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\n1. Diagnosing physical health issues\nI've definitely fed ChatGPT my symptoms out of curiosity, but the answers that come back can read like your worst nightmare. As you pore over potential diagnoses, you could swing from dehydration and the flu to some type of cancer. I have a lump on my chest and entered that information into ChatGPT. Lo and behold, it told me I may have cancer. In fact, I have a lipoma, which is not cancerous and occurs in 1 in every 1,000 people. My licensed doctor told me that.\nI'm not saying there are no good uses of ChatGPT for health: It can help you draft questions for your next appointment, translate medical jargon and organize a symptom timeline so you can walk in better prepared. And that could help make doctor visits less overwhelming. However, AI can't order labs or examine you, and it definitely doesn't carry malpractice insurance. Know its limits.\n2. Taking care of your mental health\nChatGPT can offer grounding techniques, sure, but it can't pick up the phone when you're in real trouble with your mental health. I know some people use ChatGPT as a substitute therapist. CNET's Corin Cesaric found it mildly helpful for working through grief, as long as she kept its limits front of mind. But as someone who has a very real, very human therapist, I can tell you that ChatGPT is still really only a pale imitation at best, and incredibly risky at worst.\nChatpGPT doesn't have lived experience, can't read your body language or tone, and has zero capacity for genuine empathy. It can only simulate it. A licensed therapist operates under legal mandates and professional codes that protect you from harm. ChatGPT doesn't. Its advice can misfire, overlook red flags or unintentionally reinforce biases baked into its training data. Leave the deeper work -- the hard, messy, human work -- to an actual human who is trained to properly handle it. If you or someone you love is in crisis, please dial 988 in the US, or your local hotline.\n3. Making immediate safety decisions\nIf your carbon-monoxide alarm starts chirping, please don't open ChatGPT and ask it if you're in real danger. I'd go outside first and ask questions later. Large language models can't smell gas, detect smoke or dispatch an emergency crew. In a crisis, every second you spend typing is a second you're not evacuating or dialing 911. ChatGPT can only work with the scraps of info you feed it, and in an emergency, it may be too little and too late. So treat your chatbot as a postincident explainer, never a first responder.\n4. Getting personalized financial or tax planning\nChatGPT can explain what an ETF is, but it doesn't know your debt-to-income ratio, state tax bracket, filing status, deductions, retirement goals or risk appetite. Because its training data may stop short of the current tax year, and of the latest rate hikes, its guidance may well be stale when you hit enter.\nI have friends who dump their 1099 totals into ChatGPT for a DIY return. The chatbot simply can't replace a CPA who can catch a hidden deduction worth a few hundred dollars or flag a mistake that could cost you thousands. When real money, filing deadlines, and IRS penalties are on the line, call a professional, not AI. Also, be aware that anything you share with an AI chatbot will probably become part of its training data, and that includes your income, your Social Security number and your bank routing information.\n5. Dealing with confidential or regulated data\nAs a tech journalist, I see embargoes land in my inbox every day, but I've never thought about tossing any of these press releases into ChatGPT to get a summary or further explanation. That's because if I did, that text would leave my control and land on a third-party server outside the guardrails of my nondiscloure agreement.\nThe same risk applies to client contracts, medical charts or anything covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act, HIPAA, the GDPR or plain old trade-secret law. It applies to your income taxes, birth certificate, driver's license and passport. Once sensitive information is in the prompt window, you can't guarantee where it's stored, who can review it internally or whether it may be used to train future models. ChatGPT also isn't immune to hackers and security threats. If you wouldn't paste it into a public Slack channel, don't paste it into ChatGPT.\n6. Doing anything illegal\nThis one is self-explanatory.\n7. Cheating on schoolwork\nI'd be lying if I said I never cheated on my exams. In high school, I used my first-generation iPod Touch to sneak a peek at a few cumbersome equations I had difficulty memorizing in AP calculus, a stunt I'm not particularly proud of. But with AI, the scale of modern cheating makes that look remarkably tame.\nTurnitin and similar detectors are getting better at spotting AI-generated prose every semester, and professors can already hear \"ChatGPT voice\" a mile away (thanks for ruining my beloved em dash). Suspension, expulsion and getting your license revoked are real risks. It's best to use ChatGPT as a study buddy, not a ghostwriter. You're also just cheating yourself out of an education if you have ChatGPT do the work for you.\n8. Monitoring information and breaking news\nSince OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT Search in late 2024 (and opened it to everyone in February 2025), the chatbot can fetch fresh web pages, stock quotes, gas prices, sports scores and other real-time numbers the moment you ask, complete with clickable citations so you can verify the source. However, it won't stream continual updates on its own. Every refresh needs a new prompt, so when speed is critical, live data feeds, official press releases, news sites, push alerts and streaming coverage are still your best bet.\n9. Gambling\nI've actually had luck with ChatGPT and hitting a three-way parlay during the NCAA men's basketball championship, but I would never recommend it to anyone. I've seen ChatGPT hallucinate and provide incorrect information on player statistics, misreported injuries and win-loss records. I only cashed out because I double-checked every claim against real-time odds, and even then I got lucky. ChatGPT can't see tomorrow's box score, so don't rely on it solely to get you that win.\n10. Drafting a will or other legally binding contract\nChatGPT is great for breaking down basic concepts. If you want to know more about a revocable living trust, ask away. However, the moment you ask it to draft actual legal text, you're rolling the dice. Estate and family-law rules vary by state, and sometimes even by county, so skipping a witness signature or omitting the notarization clause can get your whole document tossed. Rather, let ChatGPT help you build a checklist of questions for your lawyer, then pay that lawyer to turn that checklist into a document that stands up in court.\n11. Making art\nThis isn't an objective truth, just my own opinion, but I don't believe AI should be used to create art. I'm not anti-artifical intelligence by any means. I use ChatGPT for brainstorming new ideas and help with my headlines, but that's supplementation, not substitution. By all means, use ChatGPT, but please don't use it to make art that you then pass off as your own. It's kind of gross."

Brooks' How to Build A Life columns in The Atlantic.\n- A science fan's guide to visiting Yellowstone National Park, complete with geological explanations and biodiversity insights.\n- An overview of long-term trends in human well-being published by the University of Oxford-affiliated project, Our World In Data.\n- Science-backed parenting advice based on psychology professor Jacqueline Nesi's popular Substack newsletter, Techno Sapiens.\n- The complete works of William Shakespeare, for students and scholars to explore.\n- An exploration of first-quarter earnings reports from the top 50 public companies worldwide, for financial analysts and market watchers alike\nEach notebook allows you to explore the original sources, view a mind map, and listen to a pre-made Audio Overview. That's in addition to the ability to ask questions based on the sources in the chat, which is NotebookLM's simplest and most obvious use case.\nGoogle has partnered with both The Economist and The Atlantic, so you can expect to see additional collections of notebooks on the way from these publications.\nPublic notebooks made featured notebooks possible\nLast month, Google introduced the ability to mark your notebooks as public so you could share them with anyone you wanted to. Google said there have been over 140,000 public notebooks created. While that's a bit tough to assess without additional data points, the introduction of public notebooks paved the way for featured notebooks. Previously, your creations were available to you and only you, unless you'd upgraded to the premium version of NotebookLM.\nMore features on the way\nWe know of at least one more feature that NotebookLM will eventually offer, and that's Video Overviews. Audio Overviews are already great -- so much so that Google has added them to more of its products. The introduction of Video Overviews will definitely appeal to those who could easily tune out when listening to audio or are more visual learners.\nThere's no specific date attached to their arrival, outside of the \"coming soon\" timeline Google provided in a blog post during the Google I/O conference in May.\nThe AI- and web-focused tech site Testing Catalog has been ahead of the game when it comes to discovering new features or features that Google is testing for NotebookLM. Here's what else they've managed to spot that could be on the way.\nAI flashcards: You can already create study guides with NotebookLM, but a new feature that could be of great benefit to students is the ability to generate flashcards on the fly based on your content sources.\nDiscover sources via Google Drive: NotebookLM lets you find new sources in the Discover Sources section. You type in what you're looking for, and it scour the web for relevant content. Soon, that search may extend to Google Drive.\nInteractive Quizzes: Google's making NotebookLM a go-to assistant for students, and it might add interactive quizzes based on your sources.\nMicrosoft Word doc support: Right now, when you're trying to select a source from Google Drive, you can only choose between Google Docs or Google Slides. In the future, it appears that NotebookLM might gain support for adding Microsoft Word docs that are also in your Drive, too.\nFor more, don't miss the 11 things you should stop using ChatGPT for right now."

      "text": "NotebookLM is easily one of Google's best AI tools out there and one that I continue to use on a daily basis for organization and brainstorming. It's not without competition, but since it's been around for a few years, it remains the best.\nDespite all it can do, NotebookLM's true power lies within its ease of use. It's approachable for someone with no experience using AI, and its features are simple to pick up to see what they can do for you. Just feed it some sources and let it do the rest for you, whether you're trying to create a study guide for school, a briefing document for work or an audio overview for the chapter from your book club that you said you read but didn't get around to.\nGoogle has been on a rollout rampage with new features for NotebookLM lately, from simple, quality of life improvements to new additions that will change the way you use it. If you're new to using NotebookLM, I've compiled a list of its best features and how you can make it work for you.\nNotebookLM isn't just Google Keep stuffed with AI, nor is it just a chatbot that can take notes. It's both and neither. Instead of asking questions of Gemini, only for it to find an answer from the ether of the internet, NotebookLM will search only through the sources you provide it. It's a dead simple concept that feels like one of the most practical uses of AI. And Google didn't stop there.\nNow it can do so much more, and it'll reward your poking around to see what it can do for you. Features like its impressive Audio Overviews have since trickled down into Gemini itself, allowing them to be used in a wider set of Google's products.\nWhat is NotebookLM?\nNotebookLM is a Gemini-powered note-taking and research assistant tool that can be used in many ways. It all starts with the sources you feed it, whether they're webpage URLs, YouTube videos or audio clips, allowing you to pull multiple sources together into a cohesive package and bring some organization to your scattered thoughts or notes.\nThe most obvious use case for NotebookLM is using it for school or work. Think of it -- you've kept up with countless classes and typed notes down for every one and even perhaps recorded some lectures. Sifting through everything individually can eventually get you to some semblance of understanding, but what if you could get them to work together?\nOnce you've uploaded your sources, Gemini will get to work to create an overall summary of the material. From there, you can begin asking Gemini questions about specific topics on the sources and information from the sources will be displayed in an easy-to-understand format. This alone may be enough for some people just looking to get the most out of their notes, but that's really just scratching the surface.\nAvailable for desktop and mobile\nNotebookLM has been available for a while now on the desktop and is broken into a three-panel layout, consisting of Source, Chat and Studio panels. Both the Source and Studio panels are collapsible, so you can have a full-screen chat experience if you prefer.\nWhile the Source and Chat panels are pretty self-explanatory, the Studio panel is where magic can happen (though some of the features can also be created directly from the Chat panel). This is where you can get the most out of your NotebookLM experience.\nThe NotebookLM app: Information alchemy in your pocket\nThose familiar with the desktop experience will feel right at home with the mobile apps for iOS and Android. The streamlined app allows you to switch between the Source, Chat and Studio panels via a menu at the bottom. When you go to the view that shows all of your notebooks, you'll see tabs for Recent, Shared, Title and Downloaded.\nWhile not everything is on the app yet, it's likely just a matter of time before it matches the web version's full functionality.\nAudio Overviews\nIf you didn't hear about NotebookLM when it was first announced, you likely did when Audio Overviews were released for it. Once you have at least one source uploaded, you can then opt to generate an Audio Overview, which will provide a \"deep dive\" on the source material. These overviews are created by none other than Gemini, and it's not just a quick summary of your material in audio format -- it's a full-blown podcast with two \"hosts\" that break down complex topics into easy-to-understand pieces of information. They're incredibly effective, too, often asking each other questions to dismantle certain topics.\nThe default length of an Audio Overview will vary depending on how much material there is to go over and the complexity of the topic -- though I'm sure there are other factors at play. In my testing, a very short piece of text created a five-minute audio clip, whereas two lengthier and more dense Google Docs documents I uploaded created an 18-minute Overview.\nIf you want a little more control on the length for your Audio Overview, you're in luck. Announced in a blog post during Google I/O earlier this month, users now have three options to choose from: shorter, default and longer. This is perfect if you either want to have a short and dense podcast-like experience of if you want to get into the nitty gritty on a subject with a longer Audio Overview.\nYou can interact with your AI podcasters\nIt gets even better. Last December, NotebookLM got a new design and new ways to interact with Audio Overviews. The customize button allows you to guide the conversation so that key points are covered. Type in your directive and then generate your Audio Overview.\nNow, if you want to make this feature even more interactive, you can choose the Interactive mode, which is still in beta, to join the conversation. The clip will play, and if you have a particular question in response to something that's said, you can click the join button. Once you do, the speakers will pause and acknowledge your presence and ask you to chime in with thoughts or questions, and you'll get a reply.\nI wanted to try something a little different, so I threw in the lyrics of a song as the only source, and the AI podcast duo began to dismantle the motivations and emotions behind the words. I used the join feature to point out a detail in the lyrics they didn't touch on, and the two began to dissect what my suggestion meant in the context of the writing. They then began linking the theme to other portions of the text. It was impressive to watch: They handled the emotional weight of the song so well, and tactfully at that.\nVideo Overviews\nThe Video Overviews feature starting reaching users in late July, and is still rolling out at the moment -- of the three Google accounts I used NotebookLM with, I only have Video Overviews available in one of them.\nThe new feature creates an animated visual aid to go alongside your Audio Overview. For now, Google says that Video Overviews will start out as slideshows, which suggests that more types of these overviews will be available in the future. A Veo-powered Video Overview wouldn't be a completely surprising addition in future.\nTo test out the feature, I grabbed 1,600 or so words from the Odyssey. It took nearly 20 minutes for the overview to generate -- and even then, it wasn't actually ready. When I clicked the play button, NotebookLM automatically went back to \"Generating Video Overview... This may take a while.\" and it stuck there so long I decided to delete the entire notebook and start over. Unfortunately, the second attempt also seemed to get stuck, too, but I could have just been impatient while the overview was being processed.\nI cut the word count by half, and sure enough, this sped up the overview generation significantly, and I was watching the slideshow within 5 or 6 minutes.\nThe current version of Video Overviews available are fine, but they aren't anything to write home about. There will be visual aids, but the one that was generated based on the text from the Odyssey was largely an Audio Overview with slides of quotes from the source and didn't add too much to the experience overall. I have little doubt that this will change in the future, but the current version of Video Overviews feels more like a slightly upgraded version of Audio Overviews rather than its own thing yet.\nHere's an example of the current Video Overview format.\nMind Maps\nI'd heard interesting things about NotebookLM's Mind Map feature, but I wanted to go in blind when I tried it out, so I did a separate test. I took roughly 1,500 words of Homer's Odyssey and made that my only source. I then clicked the Mind Map button, and within seconds, an interactive and categorical breakdown of the text was displayed for me to poke around in.\nMany of the broken-down sections had subsections for deeper dives, some of which were dedicated to single lines for dissection. Clicking on a category or end-point of the map will open the chat with a prefilled prompt.\nI chose to dive into the line, \"now without remedy,\" and once clicked, the chat portion of NotebookLM reopened with the prefilled prompt, \"Discuss what these sources say about Now without remedy, in the larger context of [the subsection] Alternative (worse).\" The full line was displayed, including who said it, what it was in response to and any motivations (or other references) for why the line was said in the text.\nPublic and featured notebooks\nInitially, notebooks were bound only to your account, but Google added the option to share your notebook with people or make them entirely public and sharable via a link. While it's a simple addition, it opens up the doors for collaboration if you're working on a notebook with someone else, as you can provide edit or view-only access. For the latter, a teacher could create a study guide on a particular subject for an exam or homework assignment to share with a class.\nThe introduction of public and sharable notebooks paved the way for another feature that Google dropped in July: featured notebooks. Publicly available to anyone, featured notebooks come from publications, authors and researchers that cover a variety of topics. The list is limited to only eight notebooks at the moment, but more will come over time.\nStudy guides and more\nIf the combination of all that Audio Overviews and Mind Maps could do sounds like everything a student might need for the perfect study buddy, NotebookLM has a few other features that will solidify it in that place.\nStudy guides\nAfter you've uploaded a source, you can create a quick study guide based on the material that will automatically provide a document with a quiz, potential essay questions, a glossary of key terms and answers for the quiz at the bottom. And if you want, you can even convert the study guide into a source for your notebook.\nFAQs\nWhether you're using it for school or want to create a FAQ page for your website, the NotebookLM button generates a series of potentially common questions based on your sources.\nTimeline\nIf you're looking for a play-by-play sort of timeline, it's built right in. Creating a timeline for the Odyssey excerpt broke down main events in a bulleted list and placed them based on the times mentioned in the material. If an event takes place at an unspecified time, it will appear at the top of the timeline, stating this. A cast of characters for reference is also generated below the timeline of events.\nBriefing document\nThe briefing document is just what it sounds like, giving you a quick snapshot of the key themes and important events to get someone up to speed. This will include specific quotes from the source and their location. A summary of the material is also created at the bottom of the document.\nSmall additions add up\nBig features like Audio Overviews tend to get all of the attention, but Google's recently rolled out a couple of smaller additions or lifted previous restrictions that make NotebookLM accessible to more people and easier to use.\nNotebookLM had been restricted to people aged 18 or older, but Google has changed this restriction so younger people can use the tool to help them learn and study with schoolwork. Now, NotebookLM can be used by anyone ages 13 or older, though some countries may have different age restrictions.\nNotebookLM also recently added in one of its most requested features: bulk URL uploads. This sounds like a simple and small addition, but it's surely to be a time saver, as previously you could only add website URLs one at a time.\nHow NotebookLM became an indispensable tool for me\nI already really liked NotebookLM's concept and execution during its 1.0 days, and revisiting the new features only strengthened my appreciation for it. My testing was mostly for fun and to see how this tool can flex, but using it when I \"needed\" it helped me really get an idea of how powerful it can be, even for simple things.\nDuring a product briefing, I did my typical note-taking: Open a Google Doc, start typing in fragmented thoughts on key points, and hope I could translate what I meant when I needed to refer back to them. I knew I would also receive an official press release, so I wasn't (too) worried about it, but I wanted to put NotebookLM to the test in a real-world situation when I was using it for real -- and not just tinkering, when nearly anything seems impressive when it does what you tell it to.\nI decided to create a new notebook and make my crude notes (which looked like a series of bad haikus at first glance) the only source, just to see what came out on the other end. Not only did NotebookLM fill in the blanks, but the overall summary read almost as well as the press release I received the following day. I was impressed. It felt alchemical -- NotebookLM took some fairly unintelligible language and didn't just turn it into something passable, but rather, a pretty impressive description.\nFunny enough, I've since become a more thorough note-taker, but I'm relieved to know I have something that can save the day if I need it to.\nIf you need more from NotebookLM, consider upgrading\nMost people will likely never have the need to pay for NotebookLM, as the free version is robust enough. That said, if you need more, you can upgrade for additional features. Upgrading NotebookLM will provide everything from the free version, along with:\n- 5x more Audio Overviews, Video Overviews, notebooks, queries and sources per notebook.\n- Access to premium features such as chat customization, advanced sharing and notebook analytics.\nFor more, don't miss Google's going all-in on AI video with Flow and Veo 3."

      "text": "Do you consider yourself a Chrome ninja? If not, these tips can help you navigate the web with deadly efficiency.\nPin tabs\nI spend much of my day using Gmail and Google Drive , and with Chrome's tab-pinning feature, I can keep those tabs parked to the left of all of my many open tabs. It's a great way to keep the tabs you're constantly visiting and revisiting within an arm's reach. To pin a tab, just right-click it and select Pin Tab. It will move to the left of your tabs where it will stay readily available. Better yet, the size of the tab shrinks to give you more room to juggle the rest of your open tabs.\nMute tabs\nWhere is that sound coming from? Chrome identifies which tabs are playing audio by placing a little speaking icon on the tabs making noise. If a video starts playing on one of your background tabs, look for the little speaker icon. To mute its audio, right-click the tab and hit Mute Tab. You'll mute the offending tab without leaving your current tab.\nBlock autoplay videos\nIf you find yourself constantly muting tabs, why not just put a stop to autoplay videos altogether? Type chrome://flags/#autoplay-policy into Chrome's URL bar, which will open Chrome's list of features Google is testing out, but have yet to make it into the official release. For the autoplay policy, select Document user activation is required and then click the Relaunch Now button.\nBlock notification requests\nAfter autoplay videos, my least favorite part about browsing the web are the constant requests from sites asking me if I'll let them show me notifications. My answer is always \"block.\" Thankfully, there is a way to tell Chrome to stop sites from asking. Open Settings and scroll down to the bottom and click Advanced. In the Privacy and security section, click Content Settings. Next, click Notifications and then click the toggle switch so it goes from Ask before sending to Blocked.\nQuickest way to a Google search\nYou probably know that you can use Chrome's URL bar to do a quick Google search, but that's not the fastest way. If you come across a word you want to look up, just right-click it and select Search Google for \"_____\" from the contextual menu and a new tab will open with Google search results for the word. You can also look up a phrase the same way by first highlighting the whole phrase and then right-clicking.\nZoom out to normal view\nFrequently, my MacBook's touchpad misreads a swipe or gesture and wildly zooms in on the page I'm reading. So I memorized the Command-0 (zero, that is) keyboard shortcut, which returns Chrome to the regular zoom level. (That's Ctrl-0 for you Windows users.)\nSelect multiple tabs\nIf your open tabs have reached the point where you want to break off a bunch and move them into their own window, you can select multiple tabs by holding down Command (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows) and clicking the tabs you want to move. You'll see that the tabs are highlighted in a lighter shade from your other tabs. With your tabs selected, you can release the Command or Ctrl button and then drag the tabs from the current window and they'll all open in a new window of their own.\nReopen a closed tab\nAccidentally closed a tab? You can bring it back by hitting Command-Shift-T on a Mac or Ctrl-Shift-T on a PC.\nStart where you left off\nDid you know you can tell Chrome to restart not with a blank page but where you left off, with all of your many tabs. I like to shut down my MacBook from time to time to keep it running smoothly, and I like to be able to pick up right where I left off in Chrome after a reboot. To do this, go to Chrome's Settings, scroll down to the On startup area and select Continue where you left off.\nSee what's slowing you down\nIs Chrome acting sluggish? You can see if there is a particular tab that's causing the slowdown by using Chrome's built-in Task Manager. It shows which tabs are using the most CPU and memory resources. To open Chrome's Task Manager, click the triple-dot button in the top right and go to More Tools > Task Manager. The small Task Manager window shows fluctuating percentages for each open tab and extension you have running in terms of CPU and memory usage. Highlight a tab or an extension and click the End Process to kill any egregious resource hog and reclaim some CPU and memory overhead.\nSave time with autofill\nTired of entering your address or credit card info on web forms? You can save this information and have Chrome enter it for you. Go to Settings > Advanced > Passwords and forms > Autofill settings to save address and payment information with Chrome. When you come to a web form, you just need to enter the first letter or your name or first number of your credit card and Chrome will offer to fill out the appropriate boxes for you."

      "url": "https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/im-already-a-notebooklm-fan-this-sharing-feature-just-made-it-even-better/",
      "text": "I've said it before, and I'll say it again: NotebookLM feels like one of the most practical uses of AI ever. Even better, it doesn't have much of a learning curve for you to wield its power, and you can quickly see how it works for you.\nAnd here's a great new addition to its skill set: NotebookLM users can now share their notebooks publicly (or privately) with anyone. So the next time someone asks to see your class notes, you can share your notebook with them and they can generate a study guide on the fly.\nThe Gemini-powered research assistant allows you to add a source like a document, pasted text or even a web page and ask specific questions about the material, and Gemini will only use information from the source itself. That's NotebookLM at its simplest. From there, you can generate briefing docs, timelines, or even full-on podcast-like Audio Overviews based on the topic of your sources. Its power and versatility easily lend themselves to being a go-to tool for school and work.\nNotebookLM stands out in a sea of AI-powered tools aimed at sourcing answers to questions from all corners of the internet. And while it's not free from direct competition, it remains accessible and free to anyone with a Google account -- and that's a lot of people.\nThe news about the notebook sharing came out Tuesday, just a couple of weeks on from the Google I/O conference, where the company went all in on its latest AI developments, including what we'll be seeing with Android XR and a new way to search.\nI first heard of this feature coming through Testing Catalog in early May. Google also surfaced the upcoming Video Overviews before they were officially announced last month via a blog post. While we're still waiting for that feature to roll out, here's how to share a notebook on NotebookLM with anyone.\nFor more on AI, don't miss 27 ways to make gen AI work for you.\nHow to share a notebook on NotebookLM\nSince this is a Google product, sharing a notebook on NotebookLM is similar to sharing a document via Google Drive. You'll also have a few options for controlling what a viewer has access to.\nHow to share a notebook with restricted access:\n- From the notebook, click the Share button at the top right\n- Add the person(s) you want to share it with\n- Click Send\nNow, if you want to make the notebook public, you can click the dropdown in the Notebook access section from Restricted Access to Anyone with link. From there, just copy the link to the notebook and share wherever you want.\nAt the moment, or at least not for me, sharing isn't available for the mobile app. I also tried to share a notebook via the web to see if it would appear in the \"shared\" tab within the app, but it never popped up. So it looks like an update to the app or a server-side push will be required to see your shared notebooks sync between mobile and web.\nAdditional sharing options\nThere aren't many options when sharing a notebook, but you do have access to a few tweaks.\nThe first option is a toggle to add a welcome note when sharing a notebook. You can add your own note if you want, otherwise a boilerplate intro will be sent. It's a small addition, but this can be helpful for people who have never heard of or used NotebookLM before.\nThe second option is to restrict the viewer from accessing the full notebook, leaving access to only the chat function. Providing full access to the notebook will not allow someone to edit the content, but it will allow them to generate Audio Overviews, Mind Maps, and other NotebookLM features.\nWhy notebook sharing is a big deal for NotebookLM\nMaybe you've tried out NotebookLM, but it didn't grab you -- or didn't have the content to feed it to make it work for you. While all it takes is some mild exploration to get a grip on the tool's capabilities, it does take a touch of tinkering. When I was first exploring it, I knew how to use NotebookLM, but I really didn't see its usefulness until I used it in a real-world scenario for work. Only then did I really see how great a tool it is -- and now I use it all the time.\nNow, people can access public notebooks with multiple sources and get a sense of how the tool works without having to do any of the legwork. Moreover, this also allows someone like a teacher to build a notebook with resources for a class or even a specific test that can be shared with students for studying.\nIn the future, I'd love it if NotebookLM could give viewers the option to submit content for the notebook's owner to consider as a source. This could allow a notebook to become a living document or database where you could, say, identify trends or even something like a customer feedback archive that could easily be searched through.\nNotebookLM is approachable because it's incredibly simple at its core. Its purpose is to easily surface information when you need it, and adding more complex features won't hinder that mission.\nFor more, don't miss Google's AI vision finally came into focus at its I/O conference last month."

      "text": "The launch of AI chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022 completely transformed how we interact with technology. Generative AI can answer questions in WhatsApp chats, summarize emails in Outlook, create \"genmojis\" in iMessage and spit out answers to complex questions with ease.\nPHOTO EDITING SOFTWARE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $42 (save $28)\n- $40 (save $25)\n- $100 (save $40)\nNow pretty much every major tech company has launched its own chatbot to compete with ChatGPT, including Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot and Meta AI. And the big tech companies that aren't launching their own chatbots are getting involved in other ways, such as Apple partnering with OpenAI and ChatGPT in its upcoming iOS 18. Smaller startups also have working AI chatbots that compete well against trillion-dollar companies, including Anthropic's Claude and Perplexity.\nAt CNET, we reviewed all of those AI chatbots to find the best one for you (side note: doing so rewired my brain). The list below focuses on free versions as opposed to paid ones, but note that most AI chatbots do have a paid tier that often performs better than the free version. For most people, however, the free chatbot will get you 90% of what you need.\nWhat is the best AI chatbot of 2024 so far?\nClaude by Anthropic is the best AI chatbot overall right now. That doesn't mean ChatGPT or Perplexity are bad. Actually, both have their own advantages and disadvantages. Overall, though, the breadth at which Claude is able to answer questions and its calibration towards nuance and engagement should make it the most valuable to most people.\nBest overall AI chatbot\nPros\n- Gives nuanced answers with detail\n- Fast and well organized\nCons\n- Not connected to the internet\n- Doesn't automatically provide sources\nClaude by Anthropic is CNET Editors' Choice for the best overall AI chatbot. That doesn't mean it excels at every task compared to the competition. Rather, it does a consistent job and goes further than what's coming out of Google, Microsoft, Perplexity and OpenAI at the free tier.\nThe major things holding Claude back are its apathetic linking to outside sources and the lack of an Android app. If Anthropic could better tune Claude to have access to the open internet to link to sources and shopping links, it'd make the chatbot a true one-stop-shop. Despite the omission, the quality of its responses and its willingness to engage in heady conversations make it the most useful overall. I also like how Claude is more willing to engage and ask the user questions.\nPros\n- Gives meaningful answers with a good amount of context\n- Does most things well, including research, email writing and recommendations\nCons\n- Could tap more into historical context for explanations\n- Can be slow at times\n- Asking for sources can be tedious\nA close contender for the top spot is OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o, which is now available for free, albeit with caveats. OpenAI says that while free users will have access to its ChatGPT-4o model, when usage limits are reached based on demand free users will revert back to the older 3.5 model. While free users are able to ask ChatGPT-4o up to 40 messages every three hours, that number might be reduced due to high demand.\nChatGPT Free offers detailed and nuanced answers, but they weren't quite as high-quality as Claude. Putting the two side-by-side, I noticed slight differences in the quality of answers. I particularly liked the specificity that Claude delved into when asking heavier political questions, such as the morality of the Israel-Palestine conflict. And like Claude, ChatGPT doesn't link to outside sources. Sometimes when you ask it to provide sources, it'll suggest things to Google or YouTube.\nPros\n- Includes list of all sources used\n- Gives nuanced answers in an easy-to-follow list\nCons\n- Too much reliance on Reddit posts and forums, which aren't citable for most people\nPerplexity did the best job for research in my testing. The team at Perplexity has tuned its AI chatbot to add loads of links into answers. Hyperlinks can include journalistic publications, Reddit posts and even YouTube videos.\nWhen writing essays or articles, links to actual sources are critical. Perplexity actually lists each source in a handy sidebar that can be easily accessed. And, thankfully, the sources aren't simply Wikipedia, which won't fly with your college professor. The only downside is that Perplexity does rely on forum posts and Reddit for its answers, which aren't journalistic or scholarly. I'm sure the information is handy, but that will mean doing more research on your part to ensure those factoids are accurate and can be sourced to something more attributable.\nPros\n- Gives solid shopping recommendations and product research\n- Links to Amazon products directly\n- Connected to open internet with option to double-check against Google Search\nCons\n- Can make stuff up\n- Doesn't answer questions on difficult subject matters\nGoogle's AI engine has been prone to hallucinations -- simply making up stuff -- such as when Google's AI overviews feature was rolled back last month when it suggested people eat rocks. When I reviewed Gemini earlier this year, it was the lowest-rated AI chatbot out of the bunch, with a dismal 5/10 score.\nBut AI chatbots aren't stationary pieces of technology that exist in a vacuum. Gemini has improved since I reviewed it back in April, although it still hallucinates. In my recent testing, for example, Gemini made up the name of a college professor and the name of an Adult Swim executive. And it simply refuses to answer heavier political questions, as does Microsoft's Copilot.\nBut the one area in which Gemini did excel was in how-to guides and shopping recommendations. When I asked how to cut a perfect circle in a piece of vinyl, not only did Gemini give a list of instructions, it also linked to products on Amazon that could make the process easier. None of the other chatbots linked to Amazon products. When it came to shopping recommendations, Gemini gave quick and concise answers with links to where to buy products.\nHow we tested AI chatbots\nTesting for AI requires constant tweaking. Because companies are always looking at ways to improve their AI models, tests that worked to push AI chatbots last year or even last month might not work today. That said, we try to test AI chatbots with questions we believe normal people will ask. We aren't necessarily trying to \"break\" AI chatbots with obtuse-sounding questions meant to confuse. Instead, we consider what might be asked when it comes to video game guides or shopping recommendations. Our tests also ask some heavier questions about difficult events happening around the world to see which are comfortable in actually engaging.\nThe AI chatbots that sit on this list, generally, are able to take on the tougher questions and give believable answers with nuance. Like reading an article written by a university professor, we want AI chatbots to have that same level of consideration for historical context and competing interests to try and leave the reader with a better understanding from a higher-level perspective.\nFor more, check out How We Test AI.\nFactors to consider\nWhen using an AI chatbot, keep your privacy and sensitive information in mind. For example, it might seem benign to have an AI chatbot summarize your company's meeting notes. But, that data could inadvertently be used to train AI models further, and you've essentially lost control of it, according to experts. Plus, it's totally within the realm of the privacy policies for AI companies to sell that data to third parties. While Google's privacy policy might state that it'll remove any personally identifiable information, it's still best to err on the side of caution. Google actually outright recommends you don't upload any confidential information whatsoever.\nOther AI chatbots we tested\nMicrosoft Copilot: This chatbot, found on the Bing search engine, uses GPT-4 Turbo, a version of OpenAI's GPT-4 that is optimized for speed. While Copilot is still a serviceable chatbot, it doesn't answer questions with the same level of detail and nuance as Claude, ChatGPT-4o and Perplexity. Plus, its outright refusal to answer questions that are politically sensitive in nature is a demerit.\nMeta AI: Unlike other AI chatbots, Meta AI not only has its own dedicated webpage, but is integrated into Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. When CNET's Katelyn Chedraoui reviewed Meta AI earlier this year, she found it to be decent overall, but noncompetitive with the competition. While Meta AI did provide good shopping advice with some cajoling, and excelled in recipes, it fell short in other areas. When it came to research, despite it being connected to Google and Bing, it sourced nonscholarly papers, like an elementary school lesson plan.\nChatGPT 3.5: This service, which I tested earlier in 2024, has since been replaced by what OpenAI calls ChatGPT Free (which utilizes a combination of GPT-4o, GPT-4 and GPT-3.5). It is a competent AI chat engine that answers difficult questions with easy-to-understand language. It doesn't hallucinate at the rate of Google Gemini, but there really isn't a reason to switch ChatGPT to 3.5 when you can use 4o and 4 for free.\nAI chatbot FAQs\nDo I need to use AI?\nAI is a handy tool and can be a timesaver, but it isn't necessary in day-to-day life. It's totally possible to still Google Search your queries and read through articles to get the answer you're looking for. Heck, it probably gives your brain more of a mental workout!\nWhat is the best free AI?\nAnthropic Claude is currently CNET's choice for the best free AI chatbot. Free versions of ChatGPT and Perplexity also offer great results with specific advantages and disadvantages. Google's Gemini is great for shopping recommendations. Like Gemini, Microsoft's CoPilot won't answer heavier and more controversial questions.\nWhat is the best AI on mobile?\nWhile there are mobile apps for Gemini, Copilot and Perplexity, we prefer the ChatGPT app the most. It has a clean interface and is easy to navigate. But really, any app will get the job done. Unfortunately, Claude only has a mobile app for iOS and not Android.\nCan AI be trusted?\nGeoffrey Hinton, the researcher who developed the concept of neural networks and who is considered the godfather of AI, feels less enthusiastic about the technology he helped birth. As for using AI chatbots on a day-to-day basis, they're handy tools that can synthesize the world's information for you in seconds, saving you lots of research time. Just be aware that sometimes AI chatbots get things wrong and it's good to do a Google search for things that sound a bit dubious. Also, be careful when giving AI chatbots sensitive information. Don't ask an AI chatbot to summarize your company's trade secrets, as privacy policies give AI companies wide latitude to do with that data as they please."
