      "feedback": "Strong foundational scaffolding is present, but to reach world-class quality you should deliver a tightly structured, multi‑year framework with explicit anchors, fully quantified links, and rigorous sourcing. Suggestions: 1) Recast into a formal horizon‑3–5+ year scenario with clearly defined regimes (Base case: domestic‑first, tariff‑driven reshoring with energy‑intensive AI/data‑center buildout; Upside: faster productivity gains from AI/EV ramp; Downside: tariff escalations/inflation surprise or EV profitability headwinds). State regime transition conditions and probabilities, and attach invariant anchors from first principles (real rate differentials, terms of trade, productivity/BoP dynamics, policy reaction functions) even if you then calibrate them to the data you cite. 2) Flesh out the causal chain and market transmission with discrete, testable steps: policy signals (tariff path) → capital reallocation toward capital‑intensive sectors (chips, EVs, AI infra) and energy‑intensive data centers → corporate earnings/valuation re‑pricing (Ford as an exemplar of income play; CEO pay/stock‑based incentives amplifying equity dynamics) → broader equity outcomes. Tie each link to a numeric lever drawn from sources (tariff trajectory: baseline 10%, up to 145% and “80% tariff” discourse; Ford dividend yield ~5.0–5.2%, forward P/E ~8–10; Ford EV segment losses ~$1.3B in Q2; CEO median pay $19M with 7.7% rise) and label uncertainties. 3) Catalysts and invalidation: explicit triggers (tariff escalations or rollbacks, new chip/EV investment announcements, energy price stability, Ford’s EV profitability inflection) and stopping rules (e.g., a sustained inflation surprise or a tariff concession that meaningfully shifts cost of capital). 4) Quantification discipline: replace qualitative phrases with ranges and scenario‑weighted deltas (e.g., capital expenditure shifts, EV loss absorption, energy‑cost baseload feasibility, data‑center power demand) and ensure each assertion is tied to a cited ID (O4ZEED2EB for CEO pay; 65UUBU0OR and 22PL3Q360 for Ford specifics; SGB2PAZGK for tariff/China policy). Eliminate stray tokens and non‑ID cues (the extra numbers) and ensure each claim references a single or multiple IDs consistently. 5) Reconcile conflicts and biases by acknowledging divergent viewpoints (e.g., Ford as income play vs. long‑horizon EV risk; Fox News tariff stance vs. mainstream macro risk) and present a calibrated base‑case with a clear confidence interval. 6) Format and tone: present as a compact, model‑driven paragraph‑plus‑outline in the same risk/return cadence, but keep citations strictly to the IDs (O4ZEED2EB, 65UUBU0OR, 22PL3Q360, SGB2PAZGK) and drop non‑ID fragments. The base case should culminate in a concise forecast (base case, key risks, watchpoints, confidence) with explicit numerical drivers and a short list of fielded catalysts/invalidation signals.",
