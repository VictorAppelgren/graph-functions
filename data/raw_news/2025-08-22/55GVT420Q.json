  "title": "Why I'm holding out for the M6 MacBook Pro - and losing sleep over it",
  "description": "Apple sometimes stumbles into prioritizing profit margins over usefulness.",
  "content": "Apple's put itself in an unusual situation with the MacBook Pro. An updated model with an M5 processor is expected by the end of 2025, or in early 2026 at the latest, and will probably draw in the normal crowd of shoppers looking for a spec bump. But the company is also rumored to be working on an M6 version already, which could ship towards the end of 2026 -- so hypothetically, you could end up buying a brand-new laptop in March, only to have it outclassed six or seven months later.\n\nRumors claim that the M6 model will be a major redesign, in which case it may be worth waiting to see what it might look like. For some people, however, the M5 model could still end up being the better deal. It all depends on how much performance you need, the threat of price hikes, and whether Apple has learned its lesson from prior MacBook overhauls.\n\nWhat Apple has planned, and why it could be a problem\n\nWhether or not they come to fruition, a few of the M6 Pro's rumored changes should generate zero controversy. Primarily, I'm thinking of the move to a notchless OLED display, which is long overdue. A notch has never made sense on a laptop, not when Apple could've easily stuffed cameras into the bezel. OLED, meanwhile, has been available on Windows laptops for years, including my recent gaming rig. Featuring the tech in a $1,600-plus professional laptop should be de facto.\n\nThe computer may also get a 5G cellular option, which could be handy for the minority of users who don't want to tether to their smartphone when they're away from Wi-Fi. Perhaps the wildest claim is that Apple might add a touchscreen. I have my doubts about that one -- while that's another technology Windows PCs have offered for a long time, Apple has been pretty resistant to the idea of a touchscreen Mac, preferring to steer those buyers towards an iPad instead. Still, it would be a welcome addition, especially if it included Apple Pencil support for illustration and photo editing.\n\nMy real concern involves talk that the M6 Pro will be thinner and lighter than its predecessor. On the surface, that sounds like the least controversial thing possible. A 14-inch M4 model weighs 3.4 pounds (about 1.5kg), which is enough to make travel and commuting worse if you've already got other things dragging you down. Certainly, no one likes struggling with their laptop in the middle of a TSA screening.\n\nIn Apple-speak, however, \"thinner and lighter\" often translates into design compromises. Indeed, that's exactly what happened to the MacBook Pro in the late 2010s. To streamline the computer, Apple removed some of its ports, despite the fact that Pros often form the core of a workstation. That was potentially acceptable if you had a hub or a dock -- but on top of that, the company switched to its infamous \"butterfly\" keyboard design, meant to keep MacBook keyboards as slim as possible. Faults with the tech were so severe that Apple was hit with a class-action lawsuit, and adopted a special repair program as it transitioned back to scissor switches. My wife can attest to how terrible the butterfly keyboards were -- her MacBook Air still has one, and trying to type any long-form text on it is a nightmare.\n\nHopefully Apple has learned its lesson, but there's no guarantee of that. Indeed, it seems to be making a similar mistake with the iPhone 17 Air, stripping away battery life and a secondary camera in the name of making the thinnest and lightest iPhone possible. It's an answer to a question no one asked, probably as much about slashing production costs as anything else. Taking the same knife to the M6 MacBook Pro could scare people into tracking down M4 and M5 systems instead.\n\nAnd the hits just keep coming\n\nTariff wars and the diminishing value of Apple Silicon\n\nTech firms often raise prices alongside redesigned hardware, whether out of necessity, or simply because they've wanted to for a long time. Consider the Nintendo Switch 2, which recently launched for $450, whereas the original Switch was just $300 when it shipped in 2017. Adjusted for inflation, that's still over $50 extra.\n\nApple could easily fall into the same boat, given the ongoing impact of the Trump administration's tariff war. MacBook Pros are manufactured in countries like China and Vietnam -- both of which have been slapped with high import tariffs. That could spike the cost of current models, let alone overhauled ones with touchscreens, OLED panels, and/or 5G modems. In fact, outside of Apple eating the cost, the only ways out of this trap are import exemptions, renegotiated trade deals, or Apple somehow relocating MacBook manufacturing domestically. That last option is extremely unlikely, despite Trump's protests.\n\nThe only US-based Apple factory at the moment is a Mac Pro plant in Austin, Texas, and building a new one capable of serving American MacBook demand might take years, assuming there's enough local talent to staff it. The American electronics manufacturing sector is a shadow of what you'll find overseas.\n\nTariffs wouldn't be such an issue for Apple if it weren't for the fact that most people just don't need an M6 processor. An M1 Max chip is still more than good enough for video editing, and complete overkill if you're trying to run Safari, Mail, or Pages. There are general benefits to newer chips, of course, such as better game performance, and faster crunching of AI functions, but you don't need the bleeding edge to see them. I can imagine many shoppers taking a glance at an M6 Pro but then deciding to track down a used or refurbished model instead.\n\nIf you insist on buying new hardware, the safest decision may be to pick up an M5 model in the next few months, as I suggested at the beginning of this piece. Ultimately, though, we're all going to have to play it by ear on whether Apple's next big redesign makes sense.",

      "text": "PRESS RELEASE\nMay 7, 2024\nApple introduces M4 chip\nM4 enables the breakthrough design and stunning display of the new iPad Pro, while delivering a giant leap in performance\nCUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced M4, the latest chip delivering phenomenal performance to the all-new iPad Pro. Built using second-generation 3-nanometer technology, M4 is a system on a chip (SoC) that advances the industry-leading power efficiency of Apple silicon and enables the incredibly thin design of iPad Pro. It also features an entirely new display engine to drive the stunning precision, color, and brightness of the breakthrough Ultra Retina XDR display on iPad Pro. A new CPU has up to 10 cores, while the new 10-core GPU builds on the next-generation GPU architecture introduced in M3, and brings Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and hardware-accelerated mesh shading to iPad for the first time. M4 has Apple\u2019s fastest Neural Engine ever, capable of up to 38 trillion operations per second, which is faster than the neural processing unit of any AI PC today. Combined with faster memory bandwidth, along with next-generation machine learning (ML) accelerators in the CPU, and a high-performance GPU, M4 makes the new iPad Pro an outrageously powerful device for artificial intelligence.\n\u201cThe new iPad Pro with M4 is a great example of how building best-in-class custom silicon enables breakthrough products,\u201d said Johny Srouji, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. \u201cThe power-efficient performance of M4, along with its new display engine, makes the thin design and game-changing display of iPad Pro possible, while fundamental improvements to the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, and memory system make M4 extremely well suited for the latest applications leveraging AI. Altogether, this new chip makes iPad Pro the most powerful device of its kind.\u201d\nNew Technologies Enabling the New iPad Pro\nDelivering a giant leap in performance over the previous iPad Pro with M2, M4 consists of 28 billion transistors built using a second-generation 3-nanometer technology that further advances the power efficiency of Apple silicon. M4 also features an entirely new display engine designed with pioneering technologies, enabling the stunning precision, color accuracy, and brightness uniformity of the Ultra Retina XDR display, a state-of-the-art display created by combining the light of two OLED panels.\nNew 10-core CPU\nM4 has a new up-to-10-core CPU consisting of up to four performance cores and now six efficiency cores. The next-generation cores feature improved branch prediction, with wider decode and execution engines for the performance cores, and a deeper execution engine for the efficiency cores. And both types of cores also feature enhanced, next-generation ML accelerators.\nM4 delivers up to 1.5x faster CPU performance over the powerful M2 in the previous iPad Pro.1 Whether working with complex orchestral music files in Logic Pro or adding highly demanding effects to 4K video in LumaFusion, M4 boosts performance across pro workflows.\nGPU Brings New Capabilities to iPad Pro\nThe new 10-core GPU of M4 builds upon the next-generation graphics architecture of the M3 family of chips. It features Dynamic Caching, an Apple innovation that allocates local memory dynamically in hardware and in real time to dramatically increase the average utilization of the GPU. This significantly increases performance for the most demanding pro apps and games.\nHardware-accelerated ray tracing comes to iPad for the first time, and enables even more realistic shadows and reflections in games and other graphically rich experiences. Hardware-accelerated mesh shading is also built into the GPU, and delivers greater capability and efficiency in geometry processing, enabling more visually complex scenes in games and graphics-intensive apps. Pro rendering performance in apps like Octane gets a huge boost with M4, and is now up to four times faster than on M2.1 With these improvements to the CPU and GPU, M4 maintains Apple silicon\u2019s industry-leading performance per watt. M4 can deliver the same performance as M2 using just half the power. And compared with the latest PC chip in a thin and light laptop, M4 can deliver the same performance using just a fourth of the power.2\nThe Most Powerful Neural Engine Ever\nM4 has a blazing-fast Neural Engine \u2014 an IP block in the chip dedicated to the acceleration of AI workloads. This is Apple\u2019s most powerful Neural Engine ever, capable of an astounding 38 trillion operations per second \u2014 a breathtaking 60x faster than the first Neural Engine in A11 Bionic. Together with next-generation ML accelerators in the CPU, the high-performance GPU, and higher-bandwidth unified memory, the Neural Engine makes M4 an outrageously powerful chip for AI. And with AI features in iPadOS like Live Captions for real-time audio captions, and Visual Look Up, which identifies objects in video and photos, the new iPad Pro allows users to accomplish amazing AI tasks quickly and on device.\niPad Pro with M4 can easily isolate a subject from its background throughout a 4K video in Final Cut Pro with just a tap, and can automatically create musical notation in real time in StaffPad by simply listening to someone play the piano. And inference workloads can be done efficiently and privately while minimizing the impact on app memory, app responsiveness, and battery life. The Neural Engine in M4 is Apple\u2019s most capable yet, and is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.\nAdvanced Media Engine for Smooth, Efficient Streaming\nThe Media Engine of M4 is the most advanced to come to iPad. In addition to supporting the most popular video codecs, like H.264, HEVC, and ProRes, it brings hardware acceleration for AV1 to iPad for the first time. This provides more power-efficient playback of high-resolution video experiences from streaming services.\nBetter for the Environment\nThe power-efficient performance of M4 helps the all-new iPad Pro meet Apple\u2019s high standards for energy efficiency and deliver all-day battery life. This results in less time needing to be plugged in and less energy consumed over its lifetime.\nToday, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be carbon neutral across the entire manufacturing supply chain and life cycle of every product.\nShare article\nMedia\n-\nText of this article\n-\nImages in this article\n- Testing was conducted by Apple in March and April 2024. See apple.com/ipad-pro for more information.\n- Testing was conducted by Apple in March and April 2024 using preproduction 13-inch iPad Pro (M4) units with a 10-core CPU and 16GB of RAM. Performance was measured using select industry\u2011standard benchmarks. PC laptop chip performance data is from testing ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED (UX3405MA) with Core Ultra 7 155H and 32GB of RAM. Performance tests are conducted using specific computer systems and reflect the approximate performance of iPad Pro."

      "text": "Summary\n- I'm hoping the next MacBook Pro's M5 processor will offer a significant speed boost, not just an incremental one, saving real professionals some time.\n- I'd like to see Wi-Fi 7 and Thunderbolt 5 become default across all pricing tiers, if just for the sake of future-proofing an expensive work machine.\n- More color options would be nice, too, as would OLED or micro-LED panels for more contrast. It's also high time that Apple does away with camera notches.\nI have to confess -- I'm not the target audience for the MacBook Pro. While I appreciate its power, ports, and build quality, I feel a MacBook Air is just fine for most personal and work tasks. And if you want to play games, you're probably better off buying a console, a high-end Windows laptop, or a handheld PC. The MacBook Pro probably best serves people like professional video editors and audio producers, and I'm not in that camp.\nWith that said, I always look forward to testing new MacBooks, and Apple is reportedly planning to refresh the MacBook Pro in October or November of 2025. There are several items on my wishlist this year, some of which go beyond the obvious, or even what Apple is realistically capable of at the moment.\nMacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro, 2024)\n- Operating System\n- MacOS\n- CPU\n- M4 Pro 14-Core CPU\n- GPU\n- M4 Pro 20-Core GPU\n- RAM\n- 24GB, 48GB\n- Storage\n- 512GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB SSD\n- Display (Size, Resolution)\n- 16-inch 3456 x 2234 pixel resolution\n1 An M5 processor (with a meaningful speed bump)\nNot that it's necessary\nThe M4 chip in current MacBook Pros is probably plenty for most users, if not overkill. It can handle many editing tasks with ease, and even most high-end 3D games -- the ones that are actually compatible with Macs, I mean, like the Resident Evil 4 remake. With simpler apps like Safari or PowerPoint, it's going to blow through them like they barely exist, RAM use notwithstanding.\nFrom a critical point of view, a slight boost is disappointing, and for professionals, the gap between 15 and 25 percent could save huge chunks of time.\nRumors suggest that the M5 will improve performance by around 15 to 25%, and I really hope it's towards the latter end of the spectrum. From a critical point of view, a slight boost is disappointing, and for professionals, the gap between 15 and 25 could save huge chunks of time, say if you're trying to export a video project measuring hundreds of gigabytes. It might be the difference between beating rush hour traffic after work and getting stuck in it.\nWe'll presumably get Pro and Max variants of the M5, as usual, but I hope the base chip shows solid benchmarks. That's the one most people can actually afford without a corporate expense account to back them up.\n2 Wi-Fi 7 and Thunderbolt 5 across the board\nKeeping up with the Joneses\nOddly enough, all of 2024's MacBook Pros shipped without Wi-Fi 7, despite that tech having first launched in January that year. Granted, most internet connections still can't exploit the standard -- you're often lucky to have a 1 or 2Gbps plan -- but future-proofing matters when you're buying a work machine that needs to last two to three years or more. By 2028, some of us might actually have 5Gbps connections at home.\nThunderbolt 5 supports 80Gbps transfer speeds by default, and can hit 120Gbps under special circumstances.\nMeanwhile, most M4 MacBooks shipped with Thunderbolt 5, but the entry-level model was stuck with Thunderbolt 4. That wasn't a big deal, but Thunderbolt 5 supports 80Gbps transfer speeds by default, and can hit 120Gbps under special circumstances. That translates into support for more and sharper external monitors, as well as faster external storage. A Thunderbolt 5 scratch drive can make a world of difference for content creators. For us plebes, it means less time waiting for backups to complete, or better performance streaming offline movie collections.\n3 More color options\nQuite the long shot\nThe famous joke about the Ford Model T was that you could have it in any color as long as it was black. The MacBook Pro comes in two shades, thankfully, but those are still relatively dull: Silver and Space Black. Presumably they're meant to match the \"professional\" moniker, but it's not as if lawyers, designers, and engineers don't show a little style occasionally. No one's going to kick you out of a board meeting for having a green tie or a green computer.\nBolder options would be even better, a few possibilities being navy blue, burnt orange, or a crimson red.\nI'd like it if Apple at least mirrored the options available to MacBook Air buyers, which add Sky Blue and Starlight (light gold) into the mix. Bolder options would be even better, a few possibilities being navy blue, burnt orange, or a crimson red. I feel like a burnt orange MacBook would really suit me for a mobile workstation, especially if I could get matching accessories.\n4 A notchless micro-LED or OLED screen\nA man can dream, can't he?\nI doubt most owners are complaining about the displays on current MacBook Pros. They support a huge P3 color gamut, and 1,000 nits of brightness, with the ability to peak at 1,600 nits for HDR (high dynamic range) imagery. I would've killed for that when I was a working photographer.\nMy ideal 2025 MacBook Pro would eliminate any sort of display notch, and use either OLED or micro-LED technology to boost contrast.\nApple is allegedly working to bring both OLED and \"hole-punch\" cameras to MacBook Pros, but not until 2026. That's disappointing, given that some rival laptops already have OLED, and most avoid any sort of camera intrusion in their screens. I get it, Apple -- I know you hate bezels, but it feels a little ridiculous to eat into the display area because you'd rather avoid a few extra millimeters of aluminum, glass, and plastic.\nMy ideal 2025 MacBook Pro would eliminate any sort of display notch, and use either OLED or micro-LED technology to boost contrast beyond the already impressive 1,000,000:1 ratio. Apple's been using both technologies on other devices for years, including the iPad Pro -- so it'd really just be a question of scaling up to 14- and 16-inch panels. I'll bet the company is mostly concerned about maintaining profit margins, which might take a hit if the company wants to keep prices in the realm of sanity. You're already paying a high premium for Apple's build quality, considering intensifying competition from Windows laptops."

      "text": "Summary\n- Portability: Laptops offer convenience for travel and freedom to work anywhere.\n- Convenience: No assembly required with built-in components from trusted brands.\n- Decent performance: Gaming laptop easily handles games and other tasks without major downgrades.\nUntil recently, I was a PC gamer who loved tinkering with my tower to squeeze extra performance out of it. I'd built multiple gaming rigs over the years and loved the freedom of choosing my parts and the challenge of putting them together. Each build felt special, and I never considered getting a soulless gaming laptop because I thought they were a step down and couldn't deliver the same performance.\nThis changed when I started traveling frequently and needed a laptop for the road. I could have bought a slim and lightweight model, but I chose a bulky gaming laptop instead -- I wasn't willing to give up my gaming and needed something to do while waiting to catch the next flight. The smaller display and built-in keyboard took time to get used to, but I think I made the right decision.\nLet me share my experience and explain why I bought a gaming laptop instead of a desktop or handheld and haven't looked back.\n1 Portability\nReady to go anywhere\nYou can't argue with a laptop's portability, which makes it practical for long plane and train journeys or shorter trips around town. Now that I've ditched my desktop, I like the freedom of working in the garden or coffee shops instead of my office. There's no longer a fixed location that I need to be at during specific times in the day, and I feel calmer and less stressed because I can access my work and games wherever I like.\nYou can't argue with a laptop's portability, which makes it practical for long plane and train journeys or shorter trips around town.\nIt only takes me a minute to disconnect my laptop and pop it in the bag with my mouse and charger. If I'm planning to work, I add a portable monitor for optimum productivity if I'm working and leave it out when I'm on a gaming break. I once carried my desktop and monitor to weekly LANs, but there's no chance of that happening now, and it's strictly for home use only.\n2 Convenience\nNo assembly required\nI used to spend hours meticulously planning my PC build and selecting each part individually. Nowadays, I'm too busy with work and would rather buy a laptop from a trusted brand because I know it'll have quality components. I can rest assured that everything is working correctly, and I don't need to worry about a monitor or keyboard either -- it's all built in.\nA new laptop's plug-and-play nature makes life easier than installing motherboards, CPUs, and other hardware into a tower. It also gives me peace of mind because I can return the whole unit if there's a problem instead of troubleshooting all the parts of my build to see which is causing an issue.\n3 Decent performance\nEasily handles gaming and other tasks\nOne of my biggest worries when switching to a gaming laptop was the performance downgrade, but my fears were unfounded. When comparing like for like, my laptop won't compete with my desktop's full-sized graphics card, but it is equal in most other areas. This comes down to individual requirements, and users wanting more RAM slots and upgradability are better off with a desktop. I was looking for relatively good performance without worrying about upgrades, and a laptop ticked the boxes.\nI primarily use my laptop for work and watching content, with gaming as a secondary consideration. The fact that my laptop can handle any game and has an integrated 144Hz display is good enough for me and doesn't affect the fun factor. I understand its limitations and don't care about the highest graphics settings or frame rates, as long as I can enjoy the gameplay.\n4 More desk space\nLess clutter\nI once loved showing off my stylish tower and massive display. Now, I'd rather have more space and less clutter on my desk. My 17-inch laptop takes up a fraction of the space of my old PC, and I use the extra room for external speakers and drawing in my sketchbook.\nI can still add my standalone monitor when I miss the PC-like feel. It easily connects to my laptop, and I get similar graphics performance to my desktop. I could also add my old keyboard, but I don't bother; I stick to the integrated one because it has a more comfortable angle when paired with a laptop stand.\n5 Works on battery\nIndoor or outdoor use\nWhere I live, there are often power cuts, and using my laptop for a few hours without electricity is a lifesaver. My work gets done on time without setbacks, or I can play games to pass the time. Working without a power cord is one of the main reasons I can be outside in the garden, which is more peaceful than sitting in my office all day.\nWhere I live, there are often power cuts, and using my laptop for a few hours without electricity is a lifesaver.\nBut what about gaming performance? I can't enjoy the latest demanding titles on the battery because the GPU doesn't get enough power to support them. However, countless older titles aren't resource-hungry, and my laptop can easily handle them without breaking a sweat, so I can still satisfy my gaming itch without power."

      "text": "Summary\n- Apple is expected to ship a MacBook with an iPhone processor by mid-2026.\n- Personally, I'll probably avoid it, since I want the power to run any app I like when I choose a laptop.\n- The product could make serious inroads into cost-sensitive markets, though, particularly schools and businesses.\nApple rumors tend not to surprise me that often. I've been covering the company since 2006, so trends tend to be obvious. Before the Vision Pro was on the horizon, for example, it was pretty clear that Tim Cook was obsessed with augmented reality -- and there aren't many directions for that sort of interest to go. Likewise, the company was struggling with the Apple Car project for years before it was finally canceled in early 2024.\nHonestly though, I didn't have \"MacBook with an iPhone processor\" anywhere in my notes. And it's not just a rumor -- MacRumors says that references to the device have existed in Apple code for some time. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims that production could start as soon as Q4 2025, in which case we might see something on shelves by the middle of 2026.\nIt seems like we're going to get this homunculus of a laptop in short order. It doesn't sound that interesting to me personally, but it could take the Mac market in interesting new directions.\nWhat might this new MacBook look like?\nFamiliar yet strange\nBoth Kuo and MacRumors suggest that the machine will use an A18 Pro chip. That's the same one found in the iPhone 16 Pro, so it's clear that Apple isn't aiming for state-of-the-art performance, even within the context of iPhone tech. By the time spring 2026 rolls around, the A18 series should be old news, replaced with the A19 Pro in the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max.\nOtherwise, not much is known. Kuo claims that the laptop will have a 13-inch display, and ship in silver, blue, pink, and yellow. Notably, those color choices are consistent with how Apple tends to spice up its cheapest devices, like entry-level iPads and the iMac. For whatever reason, the company assumes that its richest shoppers prefer shades of black, white, or gray, with little room for deviation.\nAssuming this gadget is a budget computer, I wouldn't expect much in the way of ports or other frills. Choosing an iPhone processor suggests that Apple wants to strip things to the bone -- I wouldn't be surprised if we got something with just two or three USB-C connections, one of them intended mostly for wall power. Expect docks to become a popular accessory, if so.\nWhy I'm probably going to skip an iPhone-based Mac\nA giant step backwards\nAs I've implied, using an iPhone processor is a step backwards in performance. Even at their cheapest, M-series chips are made to be more robust, handling everything from console-quality game graphics to 4K video projects in Final Cut. You can see this split in action in the iPad lineup. Although the base iPad uses an A16 chip, it's just the M-series models that can push Stage Manager windows to external displays, or run processor-hungry apps like Final Cut at all.\nApp access is a big deal. It's the main reason most people use a laptop or desktop.\nApp access is a big deal. It's the main reason most people use a laptop or desktop, since even iPads now support a mouse, keyboard, and gigantic external display if you need any of those things. Presumably, an A18 Pro-based Mac will be able to run a lot of apps -- but possibly even fewer than an M1-based MacBook Air, which just doesn't have any appeal to me as a power user. Heck, I'm bothered by the lack of game compatibility with Apple's most expensive M-series Macs, never mind worrying about whether my daily work software will run.\nThe company could conceivably try other tricks to make the new model appealing, like making it thinner and lighter than current MacBooks. But I'm not clamoring for that, and I doubt anyone else is either. Yes, the MacBook Air's 2.7 pounds (1.24kg) is still substantially heavier in the hands than an iPad Pro -- but no one holds a laptop in their hands when they're using it, and 2.7 pounds is barely anything in a bag or backpack.\nSo why is Apple making this Mac?\nThe silent majority\nIf you're a tech aficionado of any stripe, it's easy to forget that the majority of people aren't searching for the most powerful device they can get their hands on. Mostly, they're shopping for something that does the things they want at an affordable price. Game consoles are a prime example -- specs-wise, the PlayStation 5 Pro blows the Switch 2 out of the water, but the Switch 2 has a handheld mode, and access to exclusive game lineups like Mario and Zelda. A parent probably isn't going to persuade their kid that Gran Turismo and The Last of Us are perfect substitutes for Mario Kart World and Tears of the Kingdom, so it's no wonder the Switch 2 is flying off the shelves.\nThe real killers could be the school and enterprise markets.\nAn iPhone-based MacBook will be good enough to browse the web, check email, and run a few basic work apps like Excel or Slack. It should also be good enough for media streaming, and at least some games, even if they're more likely to be older titles rather than the latest and greatest. Assuming Apple can deliver that for $200 less than a MacBook Air, it might have a hit on its hands, particularly in countries where the cost of any Mac can be daunting. The Air starts at \u20b999900 in India -- more than many people in the country will make in an entire year.\nThe real killers could be the school and enterprise markets. While you will find iPads in K-12 schools -- my son's Grade 1 class had a bunch -- they're vastly outnumbered by Chromebooks, which are both cheap and easy to manage. A MacBook closer to the Chromebook's value proposition could make real inroads, since people often complain about the build quality of budget Chromebooks, and their inability to run apps people use elsewhere.\nWill Apple seize on these opportunities? Perhaps. Apple used to be a titan in education, and there's a contingent of businesses that would love to deploy MacBooks to everyone. But it's too early to say -- for now, I'll just be patient and wait for the inevitable stream of rumors towards the end of 2025."

      "text": "Summary\n- The iPhone 17 Air may have a 120Hz display, but lack ProMotion support.\n- ProMotion dynamically adjusts the phone's refresh rate to save battery.\n- Lack of ProMotion on the iPhone 17 Air could be a battery life concern and would be a silly decision for Apple to make.\nFor the past few months, the rumor mill has been in full swing regarding the iPhone 17 Air, the supposed ultra-thin iPhone that Apple is expected to release later this year alongside the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup.\nIt's rumored to be the thinnest iPhone ever, with various leaks suggesting it could measure anywhere between 5mm and 6mm thick. That would make it the thinnest iPhone since the iPhone 6, which was relatively thin for its time but notoriously known for bending. I'll admit that the prospect of Apple finally changing the iPhone's design after five years of stagnation excites me the most about the iPhone 17 Air. However, after reading this latest rumor, I'm afraid Apple might be at risk of ruining the phone.\nAccording to Fixed Focus Digital, a well-known leaker on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air will have just a \"a normal 120hz screen, but not ProMotion adaptive refresh rate\" (via 9to5Mac).\nWhen I read this, I was taken aback immediately. If this leak turns out to be true, and the iPhone 17 Air has a 120Hz display without ProMotion, it would easily be one of the dumbest things Apple has ever done.\nWhat is ProMotion?\nIt dynamically adjusts the display's refresh rate to save battery\nIf you're unfamiliar with ProMotion, it's an adaptive refresh rate technology that dynamically adjusts the display's refresh rate based on your activities. When you're playing a game or scrolling, ProMotion increases the refresh rate to 120Hz, giving the image a smooth, fluid appearance. However, if a higher refresh rate isn't necessary, it can reduce it to help conserve battery life.\nProMotion can lower the refresh rate to as little as 1Hz...\nFor instance, if you're viewing a static image on your iPhone, ProMotion can lower the refresh rate to as little as 1Hz, since there\u2019s no motion on the screen to warrant boosting the refresh rate to 120Hz, thus saving battery. Additionally, ProMotion allows the Pro model iPhones to support Always On Display (AOD), as that mode depends on an adaptive refresh rate to operate without significantly draining battery life.\nProMotion first appeared on the second-generation iPad Pro in 2017. It wasn't until 2021 that it made its way to the iPhone, starting with the iPhone 13 Pro. This technology has been included in every Pro model since then.\n...based on this most recent leak stating that the iPhone 17 Air won't include ProMotion, it seems Apple could be cutting corners.\nLast year, when the iPhone 16 was released, I was surprised that Apple had not yet added ProMotion to the standard iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Plus. So, when I read the rumor that ProMotion would be included in all iPhone 17 models, I felt optimistic that Apple was finally going through with it. However, based on this most recent leak stating that the iPhone 17 Air won't include ProMotion, it seems Apple could be cutting corners.\nThe iPhone 17 Air needs ProMotion\nBattery life will be a major concern for the iPhone 17 Air\nDon't get me wrong; it's great that the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air may have 120Hz refresh rate displays. This is a significant improvement over 60Hz, and it will make using them so much better. However, without ProMotion technology bundled with that 120Hz display, it seems like a half-baked effort.\nIf the iPhone 17 Air doesn't have a ProMotion display, it theoretically means that the phone won't be able to dynamically adjust the refresh rate. As I mentioned earlier, one of the biggest advantages ProMotion offers is the ability to scale down the refresh rate to save battery. And on slim smartphones, which don't have large batteries due to size constraints, that's quite important.\nI believe that if Apple decides not to include ProMotion on the iPhone 17 Air, it might be one of the stupidest things it's ever done.\nWhile it's unclear exactly how large the battery in the iPhone 17 Air will be, it likely won't be as big as the one found in the iPhone 17 Pro or the iPhone 17, naturally due to the slim design of the phone. This is why I believe that if Apple decides not to include ProMotion on the iPhone 17 Air, it might be one of the stupidest things it's ever done.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is going to be a cutting-edge phone; there is no doubt about it. While its unique slim design is sure to attract a lot of attention, one of the biggest concerns people will have is battery life. The S25 Edge proves this will be an issue. Removing a battery life feature like ProMotion doesn't help alleviate any of those concerns and is just plain bizarre.\nPersonally, I hope this leak turns out to be false because I would love to see ProMotion on the iPhone 17 Air.\nOf course, I want to be very clear that all my concerns are based on Fixed Focus Digital's leak. While they've been correct in the past about some things, such as confirming the name of the iPhone 16e, they have been incorrect about others, including the number of color options available for the iPhone 16. So it's possible this leak may not be true.\nPersonally, I hope this leak turns out to be false because I would love to see ProMotion on the iPhone 17 Air. But then also, knowing Apple, which likes to do foolish things, I can easily see them removing it to save money, and to create a clear distinction between the iPhone 17 Air and the Pro models.\nPlease, Apple, I beg you, put ProMotion on the iPhone 17 Air."
