  "title": "Have Brighton left themselves short of a striker after selling Joao Pedro?",
  "description": "Hurzeler says teens Tzimas and Kostoulas aren't Premier League-ready, leaving only Rutter and Welbeck as senior options. Are they enough?",
  "content": "Midway through the second half of Brighton & Hove Albion\u2019s 2-0 away defeat against Everton, a double substitution by Fabian Hurzeler raised an uncomfortable question: have they left themselves short up front after selling Joao Pedro to Chelsea earlier this summer?\n\nHead coach Hurzeler\u2019s side were two goals down on Sunday afternoon when he made straight swaps at left-back and in midfield, introducing Ferdi Kadioglu for Maxim De Cuyper and Diego Gomez for Yasin Ayari.\n\nThere was no out-and-out striker named on the bench \u2014 Brajan Gruda, who is a No 10 or right-winger, came on in the closing minutes \u2014 as an injury that ruled out Georginio Rutter left Hurzeler depending on Danny Welbeck. The 34-year-old former England international looked rusty in what was his first start of the season; Rutter had led the attack, with Welbeck a substitute, in the opening game \u2014 a 1-1 home draw against Fulham last Saturday.\n\nEx-Manchester United and Arsenal front man Welbeck missed a good chance to put Brighton ahead and silence the home support during the first half of Everton\u2019s first-ever league game at Hill Dickinson Stadium. He could not sort his feet out and his effort went over the crossbar although, in fairness, the cross from Yankuba Minteh was a little behind him when a yard in front would have made the opportunity far simpler.\n\nWelbeck, now Brighton\u2019s first-choice taker after Joao Pedro\u2019s \u00a350million-plus move to Chelsea in July, also had a poorly struck 74th-minute penalty saved by Jordan Pickford after Matt O\u2019Riley had converted from the spot to open the scoring against Fulham. Of far more concern than who should be on penalties \u2014 this was Welbeck\u2019s second failure in six career attempts \u2014 is the need to keep him and Rutter fit.\n\nAnd for U.S. readers\n\nA total of \u00a350million has been spent this year on Greek teenagers Stefanos Tzimas and Charalampos Kostoulas (\u00a320m on Kostoulas from Nurnberg in a winter-window deal that sent him back to the German side for the rest of last season, \u00a330m on Kostoulas from Olympiacos in June). But neither is deemed by Hurzeler to be ready for the Premier League yet.\n\nHurzeler spoke at his pre-match media session on Thursday about the importance of the youngsters getting \u201ctheir bodies adapted to the intensity of the Premier League\u201d after run-outs for Brighton\u2019s under-21 side. He is treading carefully in particular with Tzimas, who has suffered a leg muscle injury in the same area \u201ctwice or three times in a row\u201d, which the German said \u201ccreates doubts in a player\u201d.\n\nAs much as this approach makes sense, it places too much of a burden on Rutter and Welbeck being available. Hurzeler\u2019s team could be playing catch-up in the Premier League by the time Tzimas and Kostoulas are ready to increase the competition at the top end of the pitch, with Evan Ferguson having been loaned to Italy\u2019s Roma for the season and Julio Enciso in the process of signing for the BlueCo group that owns Chelsea and French top-flight side Strasbourg.\n\nBrighton should have at least four points, arguably six, after these first two games, not one. Having conceded a 96th-minute equaliser against Fulham, they were better than Everton yesterday and created the clearer chances \u2014 Kaoru Mitoma and Jan Paul van Hecke hit the woodwork in the first half, and O\u2019Riley should have scored when he latched onto a James Tarkowski backpass but was not decisive enough to beat Pickford.\n\nInstead, one point from the first two matches is Brighton\u2019s worst Premier League start since their 2017-18 debut season, when that first point came in the third game. With Manchester City up next at the Amex Stadium on Sunday, it is a tough environment for gaining momentum when the points tally is out of sync with performances.\n\nIf he\u2019d been fit, Rutter would have started again on Merseyside. \u201cYesterday, he had a small issue in training and, unfortunately, then we had to make the decision,\u201d Hurzeler told The Athletic during his press conference after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s only a small issue. I am sure that he will be back soon.\u201d\n\nRutter didn\u2019t play again last season after an ankle injury sustained in the FA Cup quarter-final defeat to Nottingham Forest near the end of March, and the absence of the imposing Frenchman arguably cost Hurzeler\u2019s side a place in Europe: they took only one point from the first four league games he missed on the run-in and finished eighth, four points behind Forest.\n\nWhile he can play as the No 9, Rutter is more of a handful as a marauding No 10 \u2014 he earned that penalty against Fulham with a powerful run from a relatively deep position.\n\nHurzeler told reporters in the run-up to the Everton match that his \u00a340million record signing from Leeds United last summer is a \u201cgreat connector\u201d who \u201cgives energy to everyone\u201d with his positive, always smiling persona.\n\nWelbeck can be relied upon when he is fully up to speed. But having been affected by injuries throughout his career, he played a limited part in the latter stages of Brighton\u2019s pre-season programme.\n\nHurzeler, asked whether he felt short of attacking options to get back into Sunday\u2019s game, where the visitors trailed 2-0 early in the second half after Iliman Ndiaye and James Garner found the net for Everton, told reporters: \u201cIf we scored the goals, we won\u2019t have this discussion. We created so many chances. Not only chances \u2014 big, big chances.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it, because it would only be an excuse if I said we missed a striker or did not have enough offensive opportunities to change (things). Overall, we created enough to win this game. We had enough chances to score. That\u2019s the main thing to take away, no matter how many options we had.\u201d\n\nFurther additions were not being ruled out before the Everton defeat. There will be no transfer-market panic from owner-chairman Tony Bloom before the summer window shuts a week today, but the issue of replacing Joao Pedro\u2019s 30 goals in 70 appearances, including 15 penalties, lingers.",

  "argos_summary": "Brighton & Hove Albion lost 2-0 to Everton, raising questions about their attacking depth after selling Joao Pedro to Chelsea. Head coach Fabian Hurzeler struggled with limited options, as injuries to Georginio Rutter and Danny Welbeck left the team short of a traditional striker, and he relied on midfielders and a late substitute to fill the gap. Hurzeler defended his tactics, citing the need to develop young talents like Stefanos Tzimas and Charalampos Kostoulas while maintaining a focus on fitness and squad depth. The defeat left Brighton with only one point from two games, their lowest start since their debut season, and highlighted the urgency of strengthening the front line before the next fixtures.",
