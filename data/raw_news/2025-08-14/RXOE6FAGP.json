  "title": "After 50 hours and over 3,000 attempts, Mario Kart speedrunner proves a \"humanly impossible\" trick is actually doable, and absolutely destroys a 2-year-old world record in the process",
  "description": "\"What does it take to be the first person ever to get a world record using an exploit everyone thought was humanly impossible?\"",
  "content": "Speedrunning is a game of inches \u2013 or rather, milliseconds \u2013 and every new PB and world record is the result of somebody clawing out a tiny time save through nothing less than hard, grueling work. Such is the case with a new Mario Kart Wii world record, which started with a simple question: is a \"humanly impossible\" trick really so impossible?\n\nThat's the question a runner known as Ejay B posed some time ago about a tool-assisted speedrun on Luigi Circuit, the opening course of Mario Kart Wii. \"What does it take to be the first person ever to get a world record using an exploit everyone thought was humanly impossible?\" as the runner put it more recently on Twitter. Tool-assisted speedrunners, using emulation tools to program a precise series of inputs into the game, figured out that the fastest way to complete the course was through a technique known as a superslide.\n\nSupersliding involves positioning your vehicle along the seam between the edge of the track's ground geometry and the abyss of the out-of-bounds area, then essentially shoving yourself into the floor. The resulting state of being half-embedded into the ground can let you reach ridiculous speeds, but it's very finicky to actually stay in the ground, and it's only really possible to maintain this position on the Wario bike \u2013 which Ejay describes as \"one of the worst bikes in the game stat-wise.\"\n\nThe issue is that the TAS superslide on Luigi Circuit requires a ridiculously precise, glitched jump to get over the track's bounding wall, a landing on the seam of the world that's equally absurd in its execution requirements, and precise control of your slide on the order of 30 alternating analog stick inputs per second.\n\nThat, of course, is impossible for a human to do. But that doesn't mean the TAS version of the superslide is the only way to do the trick for real. That's where Ejay comes in. The runner discovered a setup where, by aligning yourself with a particular roadside sign, you could theoretically hit the right angle to clip out of bounds, and a path to superslide around the track that you could effectively follow with merely human reflexes.\n\nWhat came next was a multi-hour grind every day for \"over a month,\" as Ejay explains on Twitter. While the strat made the glitch viable for a human to perform, it certainly didn't make it easy, and Ejay estimates spending around 50 hours altogether to finally make the run work. It took 60 attempts to simply get the glitched jump to go out of bounds. 919 attempts to land on the seam between the void and the level. 1,293 attempts to stop on the seam.\n\nIt wasn't until attempt number 3,059, after a full month of grinding, that Ejay actually managed to get embedded in the ground and got a superslide going. This one, magic attempt was all it took. Ejay got all the way around the track, executed the planned route, and broke the single-lap record, which stood since 2023, by 0.378, \"the biggest ever time cut for a Luigi Circuit world record.\"\n\nIf you want the full technical details on how this trick works and what was put into figuring out a human-viable method to achieve it, I can't recommend Ejay's full video on the subject enough. The kicker? This was just a single-lap record, and Ejay's already worked out a method that could make this technique viable for a full three-lap race record. Godspeed to whoever attempts it, but I'm sure there's somebody in the speedrun community dedicated enough to try.\n\nHow fast can you go in the best Wii games of all time?",

      "text": "\"How do you even do this to a leaderboard of a popular game like Super Mario Bros?\": Speedrunner beats the platformer's world record by 5 seconds, the biggest jump in over a decade\n\"That was full autopilot... It doesn't feel real.\"\nSuper Mario Bros, the first one, has been around for almost four decades. You wouldn't expect speedrunners to still be one-upping each others' times for a game this old and this popular - like, surely the fastest possible combo of buttons to beat the iconic platformer has been found already - but, alas, one incredible run just smashed another world record by five whole seconds, massive in the speedrunning community.\nThe feat was achieved by speedrunner Niftski, who was already the world record holder for an Any% playthrough of Super Mario Bros. He recently turned his gaze toward a Warpless run, though, which means players can't take advantage of the game's iconic green warp pipes that skip entire levels.\nAnd in a new livestream, he saved Princess Peach in no less than 18 minutes, 49.972 seconds. To put that into context, in 2019, the record was 19 minutes and two seconds. Every year or so, another speedrunner would shave off around a second. In 2023, Niftski held the record with 18 minutes, 54 seconds, meaning he just beat his own WR with a massive jump. In fact, it's the biggest jump in well over a decade since 2013.\nSpeedrun-focused YouTuber and internet historian SummoningSalts even chimed in with shock. \"How do you even do this to a leaderboard of a popular game like Super Mario Bros lol?\" they tweeted.\nDespite pressing all the buttons himself, Niftski couldn't quite believe it either. \"Oh my god, that's my hardest world record ever. This is not real. This is not real,\" he screamed during the stream. \"No way\u2026 That was full autopilot... It doesn't feel real. It actually doesn't feel real.\"\nWhy not check out some upcoming Switch 2 games to see what else is in the (warp) pipline?\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nKaan freelances for various websites including Rock Paper Shotgun, Eurogamer, and this one, Gamesradar.

      "text": "Mario Kart World's new Rewind feature can be used in Time Trials to set wild records, like this 13-second lap\nThat's one way to use it\nMario Kart World hasn't even been out for a full week yet, but players have already found multiple ways to take advantage of its new mechanics for some wild shortcuts, including the new Rewind feature.\nRewind \u2013 an option that lets you quickly travel back in time to retrace your steps in the Switch 2 game \u2013 was quickly adopted by those racing against CPU racers to avoid things like blue shells and generally clown on their opponents. I'll be honest, I thought that's where the Rewind antics would end \u2013 after all, the feature can only be used in single-player, so you can't take the strategy online. However, it turns out it can also be used in the Time Trials mode, and one player has discovered that it can be used to complete laps incredibly quickly.\nHighlighted by YouTube creator Jopes, it turns out that if you take to a course with a small enough track, like the bite-sized Koopa Troopa Beach, and then reverse backwards from the finish line, using the Rewind feature will take you all the way around the course and complete a lap for you, all while looking like you sped your game up.\nAfter some testing and optimizations, Jopes found that when reversing around a route for two laps, Rewind won't just complete a full lap for you when used, but also give you a significant head-start on the next one. After driving as close to the inner edge of the track as possible (off-road and cutting corners over grassy patches) Jopes was able to use this to then finish off a lap with a total time just short of 13 seconds \u2013 12.856 seconds, to be exact \u2013 achieving what was a world record lap time for the track.\nAt the moment, it seems unlikely that you'd be able to do this to set a world record for the whole track \u2013 after all, driving backwards is slower, so the benefit can only really be applied to a single lap, like we see above. Still, who knows what speedrunners might be able to use it for going forward \u2013 we're already seeing some wild shortcuts as players bounce off palm trees and use the wall-riding tech to skip over corners, so we can definitely expect more strategies like this to come.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nI'm GamesRadar+'s Deputy News Editor, working alongside the rest of the news team to deliver cool gaming stories that we love.

      "text": "\"After months and months of chokes,\" speedrun legend achieves fastest blindfolded Super Mario 64 run of all time, but only after RNG ended a near-perfect run that would've killed the category \"forever\"\n\"A speedrunner that's happy with his time? It's like never happened before, dude\"\nBlindfolded speedrunning legend Bubzia is back with yet another Super Mario 64 world record, and this one has an extra special history. The new 1-star record is the first blindfolded run to break the 11-minute barrier, and represents the fastest blindfolded completion of the game ever recorded, but it sits in the shadow of a tragic run killed by RNG that might have ended the category forever.\nBubzia largely competes against himself for blindfolded Super Mario 64 speedruns these days, and one of his big goals for 2025 was achieving a 1-star record under 11 minutes. \"My original goal was to get a sub-11 minute time and then kind of quit 1-star for good,\" Bubzia explained in a video earlier this year.\nThis week, Bubzia absolutely smashed the 11-minute barrier, setting a 1-star world record of 10 minutes and 32 seconds, nearly a minute faster than his previous record, which was set in February. \"FINALLY after months and months of chokes,\" Bubzia says in a Bluesky post, \"we pulled through and the journey is over! The 11 minute barrier is officially broken!\"\nBut while this milestone is a massive one, both Bubzia and his community know that more is possible. Back in May, Bubzia had an even better run going, with nearly perfect execution through the entire game. He called it his \"very best blindfolded SM64 performance ever\" up through the game's final moments, just ahead of the final encounter with Bowser.\n\"I had to just hit the last throw and the category would be done forever,\" Bubzia recalled in the video breaking down that May run. \"I would be free from one star for my entire life. It would be over.\" If it stayed on pace, this run would end well under 10 minutes, which is the sort of record that could genuinely end any thought of lowering the time further.\nAs with the other Bowser fights throughout Super Mario 64, the final battle sees you grabbing the koopa king by the tail and tossing him into one of the bombs that lines the arena. For the blindfolded run, Bubzia needed to wait for Bowser to charge in order to be in the correct position to do the throw. There's a 50/50 chance for Bowser to either charge or do a jump attack, so you simply have to sit and wait for the charge while hoping he doesn't somehow jump five times in a row, which takes him entirely out of position for the throw, effectively killing the run.\nYes, folks. Bowser jumped five times in a row. \"Do you understand how frustrating this is?\" Bubzia asked. \"I literally played perfect for the entire game. I nailed everything. I tried my very, very best only for the game to win five coin flips in a row: a 1-in-32 chance. I know that this could happen, as it happened a few select times in the past, but the fact that it happened in this run is just absolutely crushing.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nOf course, that tragic run is in the past, and Bubzia seems extremely relieved to have achieved the new 10:32 record. \"I am very happy to finally, finally have pulled through and got the sub 11 minutes,\" he says. \"I'm really satisfied with this time. Even if I never PB again in this category. If I take a break from it, I'm happy. A speedrunner that's happy with his time? It's like never happened before, dude. But yeah, I really, really am happy.\"\nYou may also recall the great tragedy of Bubzia's broken webcam earlier this year.\nDustin Bailey joined the GamesRadar team as a Staff Writer in May 2022, and is currently based in Missouri.

      "text": "The 25 best Wii games of all time\nFrom Super Paper Mario to Kirby's Epic Yarn, these are the best Wii games to play right now\nThe best Wii games still hold a special place in our hearts in 2025, thanks to all the inventive motion control fun they offer. When the console first launched in 2006, many of the releases really leaned into the Wii controller's functionality, giving us our first real taste of physically active gameplay. While they didn't always pay off, tons of Wii titles rose above the novelty factor to bring us something memorable.\nIn fact, it soon became clear that Nintendo's ability to innovate paid off, and that's why so many of the best Wii games have stayed with us. And it's also the reason why so many fans are dying for Wii remasters to be added to the list of upcoming Switch 2 games as well. From wielding a sword as Link, to going across the galaxy as Mario, fighting zombies as Leon Kennedy, or feeling like we're actually playing tennis, the Wii is home to so many fantastic games that do things a little differently from the best Gamecube games that came before it. It also paved the way for motion controls in the Switch and now the Switch 2, impacting all of us and the new games on the horizon to this day.\nSo, if you're looking to refresh your memory or relive this slice of Nintendo's history by seeing what releases came to the Wii, read on below as we pick the 25 best Wii games of all time.\nFor more definitive rankings of Nintendo games throughout the years:\n| Best NES games | Best SNES games | Best N64 games | Best Wii U games | Best Switch games | Best Switch 2 games | Best GBA games | Best DS games | Best 3DS games\nThe best Nintendo Wii games ever made, starting with...\n25. Wii Sports Resort\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nReleased: 2009\nWhere would the Nintendo Wii be without Wii Sports? It was undoubtedly the quintessential experience for the system, with the bundled game teaching all generations about the family fun that could be had with motion gaming. But it was Wii Sports Resort that saw Nintendo really refine the concept, and it's still one of the best sports games on the console today. Packaged with Wii MotionPlus, which tracked greater accuracy in your movements and motions, Wii Sports Resort required finesse to compete without diluting the core approachability of the core idea. Table tennis and Frisbee golf joined returning classics like bowling and tennis, and the entire experience was just a delight.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\n24. Mario Kart Wii\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nReleased: 2008\nWere it not for its Wii U (and Nintendo Switch, eventually) sequel, Mario Kart Wii would undisputedly hold the crown for best Mario Kart game. However, it's still easily one of the most fun and best racing games that Nintendo has ever made. The addition of more riders per race, motorbikes, a tweaked drifting system, and the ability to perform tricks were all hailed as major improvements, and the courses are as wonderful as they've ever been.\nIf you want to check out the latest Mario Kart game after playing it on the Wii, read our Mario Kart 8 Deluxe review.\n23. Punch-Out!!\nDeveloper: Next Level Games\nReleased: 2009\nReboots and remakes are a tricky business, especially when we are talking about the best fighting games in gaming history. You want the experience to feel fresh, but you need to pay respect to what came before. Thankfully, Punch-Out!! for the Wii does exactly that, bringing back the dodge, dodge, punch rhythm that made the original such a classic and wrapping it up in a beautifully stylized package. It isn't perfect, but it's a massive improvement from the original and will keep you entertained for hours.\n22. LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga\nDeveloper: Traveller's Tales\nReleased: 2007\nOne of the best feelings as a kid or any Star Wars fan was picking up your Wii remote and swinging it around like a lightsaber as you made you're way through the Lego space-scapes of a galaxy far, far away. Yes, the new version of the game that's now available on Switch may run a little better and have more features, but that still doesn't take away from the fact that this was the best Lego game to play on the Wii, period. In this game, you get to experience the original Star Wars movies and the prequel trilogy in Lego, blasting your way through levels seen in the films and trying to unlock all the characters. It's a movie lover's dream, and it is still tons of fun to play today with motion controls.\nRead our LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga review for more details.\n21. MySims Agents\nDeveloper: EA Redwood Shores\nRelease: 2009\nIt's wild to consider that the developers behind Dead Space also made one of the best Wii games and easily the best MySims outing as well. MySims Agents on the Wii is the perfect blend of cute and captivating in terms of detective games. You take on the role of a secret agent who must solve various cases across different biomes in order to stop the plans of the dastardly Morcubus. There are puzzles such as DNA analyzing, hacking, lockpicking, and more to enjoy in tandem with the main story (which is surprisingly well written, too). Characters are full of life and genuinely funny, the game is colorful, and the Wii controls fit like a glove. Honestly, this is a sleeper hit that doesn't get the love it truly deserves.\nFor more details, check out our MySims Agents review.\n20. Red Steel 2\nDeveloper: Ubisoft\nReleased: 2010\nThe first Red Steel promised us the fantasy of wielding a console controller like a sword, transforming us into badass samurai (who also wielded guns). But it wasn't until Red Steel 2 that we finally understood how utterly cool that could feel. With more stylized visuals and support for the Wii MotionPlus, Red Steel 2 is one of the tightest action games the Wii has ever had. Sure, we may have whacked our siblings a few times with the Wii remote by accident, but it was all worth it to feel like the stars in our own blockbuster movies.\nIf you want more details on this must-play, read our Red Steel 2 review!\n19. Muramasa: The Demon Blade\nDeveloper: Vanillaware\nReleased: 2009\nWithout question, Muramasa: The Demon Blade is very high on our list of most beautiful Wii games. Its lavish, superbly animated world shames the system's tepid 3D offerings to the point where \"pretty for a Wii game\" should be forever stricken from gaming phraseology. With fantastic combat, a diverse armory of unique weapons, and over a dozen hours of gameplay, Muramasa would stand out on any system. On the Wii, it shines as one more ray of inspiration to anyone who passed on the system for good.\nIf you are in the mood for some old school action, read our Muramasa: The Demon Blade review for more information.\n18. Dead Space: Extraction\nDeveloper(s): EA Redwood Shores, Eurocom\nReleased: 2009\nDead Space: Extraction is much more than a haunted shooting gallery, as the presentation, voice acting, and exceptional visuals make you feel like a part of the action. You're not just moving along with a target reticle blasting grotesque monsters; you are that person - ducking and weaving, cussing in disbelief, shuddering with the guerrilla-style shaky cam that immerses you in the world like no other game in the genre. Like any good rollercoaster, Extraction gets your heart racing and adrenaline pounding even though you have no control. An interesting and emotional take on the lightgun scene. This is one of the best survival horror games that the Wii has to offer.\nDo you think you can survive? Check out our Dead Space Extraction review if you are brave enough.\n17. A Boy and His Blob\nDeveloper: WayForward Technologies\nReleased: 2009\nWith highly inventive gameplay and outstanding storybook visuals, the updated adventure of A Boy and His Blob (originally on the NES) is absolutely worth checking out again or for the first time. Whether it's the boy calling his pal in alternately playful and impatient tones or the blob obediently hopping along awaiting its next jellybean snack, this tale is as much about friendship as it about adventure. Nothing drives this point home more than the hug button, which serves no other purpose than to make the boy snuggle his blob like a favorite teddy bear. Simply put: You'd have to have a frigid, icy heart to not love this game on some level.\n16. Silent Hill: Shattered Memories\nDeveloper: Climax Studios\nReleased: 2009\nIt would be easy to overlook Silent Hill: Shattered Memories as a sloppy Wii remake - we all know there were plenty of those - but going in with that mindset would be a mistake. In reality, it was essentially an original story loosely based on the first Silent Hill, using the franchise as a platform to tell a dark, mature tale. Though it lacked many of the classic Silent Hill tropes, it came with a few tricks of its own, sporting interesting gameplay that analyzed your decisions to taunt you with specific elements suited to your playstyle. If that sounds weird or psychological, that's because it is. Shattered Memories is a game every Wii owner should experience.\nIf you need a good scare, read our list of the best Silent Hill games.\n15. Super Paper Mario\nDeveloper: Intelligent Systems\nReleased: 2007\nFans of Mario RPG clamored for years for more role-playing Mario goodness, and got their wish with the Paper Mario series. The Wii entry, Super Paper Mario, brings all of the silliness and charm of the RPG series to the modern era, mixing in some interesting 3D puzzles and platforming. But what really sets it apart is the dialogue and narrative, which doesn't shy away from shattering the fourth wall in favor of silly puns and awesome jokes that will have anyone, Mario fan or not, rolling on the floor with laughter.\nRead our Super Paper Mario review for more Mushroom Kingdom details!\n14. Donkey Kong Country Returns\nDeveloper: Retro Studios\nReleased: 2010\nDonkey Kong Country Returns is everything fans wanted from the series. It's beautiful, painfully difficult, and a nostalgic trip for fans of the storied franchise. And yet, it feels remarkably new, with strong mechanics and emphasis on cooperative play. DKCR is a lush, vibrant reimagining of the franchise, and one that we hope is only the first step toward a future resurgence for DK and crew.\nIf you want more primates in your retro gaming time, read our Donkey Kong Country Returns review.\n13. New Super Mario Bros. Wii\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nReleased: 2009\nThere's a reason that New Super Mario Bros. Wii is one of the best-selling games on the system: It wonderfully blended together the nostalgic feeling of classic Mario with four-player cooperative play, creating an experience that had children laughing and adults grinning from ear to ear. Though the level design isn't the best in the series, and things can get hectic with four people onscreen at the same time, the overall experience is fantastic, providing some worthwhile fun for groups and solo players alike. Just make sure to share the mushrooms.\nRead our New Super Mario Bros Wii review for more details on one of the best Mario games of all time.\n12. Boom Blox Bash Party\nDeveloper: EA\nReleased: 2009\nThe Steven Spielberg-produced (seriously) Boom Blox was an early success on the Wii, and the sequel, Boom Blox Bash Party, improves on the formula in every way. Bash Party is a brilliant little toy to mess around with, and one you'll get a lot of pleasure from regardless of how many friends or family members you rope in. It wouldn't work on any other console, and as a Wii owner, you really ought to check out at least one Boom Blox game; ideally, make it this one.\nCheck out our Boom Blox Bash Party review for more insights into this classic.\n11. Xenoblade Chronicles\nDeveloper: Monolith Soft\nReleased: 2010\nXenoblade Chronicles, a latecomer to the Wii, offers a singularly beautiful world, streamlined gameplay, likable characters, and a fantastic soundtrack. For these reasons alone, it's probably the best RPG on the Wii. Lest you think we're damning it with faint praise, there's no denying that Xenoblade is invigorating and engaging like few recent games of its kind, giving us reason to hope that this once-proud genre may yet have better days ahead. Visit the strange world of Xenoblade for 100-odd hours and see if you don't feel the same.\nFancy playing one of the best JRPGs on the Wii?

Metroid Prime 3: Corruption\nDeveloper: Retro Studios\nReleased: 2007\nMetroid Prime 3 is the ultimate achievement of the series and is one of the best Metroid games that you can play today. By this point, the formula had been tweaked and pruned to its most perfect point, with some of the best shooting on the system. Best of all, it makes beautiful use of the Wii Remote. Freely aiming with the remote makes the experience much faster than the older titles, where you had to hold R just to look around. Here, it's almost on par with a mouse and keyboard, with gesture controls - like yanking and pulling the Nunchuk to activate the Grapple Beam - that makes ripping off limbs oddly satisfying.\nFor more information, read our thoughts on Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.\n9. Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars\nDeveloper: Eighting\nReleased: 2008\nThe Wii doesn't have that many true fighting games aside from Smash Bros., and that makes the outstanding success of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom all the sweeter. Made specifically from the ground up for the Wii, the game shines on Nintendo's platform, making for a deep, complex fighting game that's perfect for those wanting something more mechanically sound than Brawl. The character models and striking design are powerful even without any HD tomfoolery, easily making this one of the most gorgeous and unique-looking titles on the system.\nFor more on one of the best Wii games ever made, read our Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars review.\n8. Rayman Origins\nDeveloper: Ubisoft\nReleased: 2011\nAt a time when games seem to offer a bit of everything, Rayman Origins stays focused on pure platforming pleasure, and it delivers. Yes, it can be too tough for some, but we're betting even more casual players will soon find themselves hopelessly addicted to the finely-tuned challenges on offer here. Play it for the love of platforming, the love of 2D art, or the love of the Rayman series. It doesn't matter why you play it. Just for crying out loud, make sure you do.\nThis game is a must-play; to learn more about it, you can check out our Rayman Origins review.\n7. Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition\nDeveloper: Capcom\nReleased: 2007\nWe've honestly lost track of the number of times Resident Evil 4 has been ported between consoles, although the version that landed on the Nintendo Wii in 2007 is arguably the best of the lot. Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition featured upgraded controls that granted us more control than ever before over Leon S. Kennedy, making his European vacation to save the President's daughter feel renewed \u2013 as terrifying and as tantalizing as it was the first time around on GameCube. Oh, and for what it's worth, Resident Evil 4: Will Edition features arguably the best motion-controlled gunplay on the system... it's truly wonderful.\nIf you want more zombies in your life or fancy seeing more of Leon, read our list of the best Resident Evil games of all time.\n6. No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle\nDeveloper: Grasshopper Manufacture\nReleased: 2010\nUsually, the word trashy is saved for bad things, but we can't think of a better, more loving way to describe No More Heroes 2. The game goes for a pulpy, sexy, raunchy vibe and nails it perfectly, with hilarious characters and awesome hack-and-slash gameplay that takes full advantage of the Wii Remote's love of waggle. Bizarre, silly situations and awesome boss battles make it easy to recommend this game to anyone interested in a completely unique experience on the Wii. Actually, it's sort of a unique experience in general; what other games let you chop up models with a lightsaber that needs to be... well... shaken to charge it up?\nFor more information, read our No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle review!\n5. Sin and Punishment: Star Successor\nDeveloper: Treasure\nReleased: 2009\nThe fact that the Wii didn't see a proper Star Fox game was disappointing, but that sadness was overridden when Sin and Punishment: Star Successor filled the void perfectly with remarkable gameplay, awesome music, and some of the most over-the-top action we've seen. Kicking missiles out of the sky? Sign us up. Extreme difficulty during the early levels might be a turnoff for some people, but if you're able to get past that (either by tenacity or by bumping the game down to Easy), you're in for an absolute treat that shouldn't be missed.\nIf you want to know more about one of the best action games ever made, read our Sin & Punishment: Star Successor super review.\n4. Kirby's Epic Yarn\nDeveloper: HAL Laboratory\nReleased: 2010\nIs Kirby's Epic Yarn easy? Yes. It's absurdly easy. You can't die, it's hard to lose, and the game basically holds your hand the entire way. And yet, despite that, it still manages to be one of the most enjoyable games on the system and one of the best Kirby games out there, with its absurdly charming art style and some of the strongest platforming from the Wii generation. Even the co-op, a weak point in some of Nintendo's other platformers, made for some incredibly enjoyable play, and the game's somewhat simplistic gameplay made it possible to play it with anyone and still have a good time.\nFor more on this cute pink icon, check out our Kirby's Epic Yarn super review.\n3. Super Smash Bros. Brawl\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nReleased: 2008\nNot much of the core gameplay changed between Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and that's because not much had to. Instead of altering the core formula, Nintendo settled for piling on loads of new content, from new items to new characters. The entire game is an insanely robust love letter to not just Nintendo's history, but video game history in general. The inclusion of both Solid Snake and Sonic The Hedgehog helped flesh out the game's already-robust character list, making for one of the most enjoyable experiences on the Wii.\nRead our five-star Super Smash Bros. Brawl review if you want more brawling details.\n2. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nReleased: 2011\nThe Wii saw the release of not one, but two Zelda games, though only one made full use of the new technology to create a unique experience. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword featured an imaginative art style which allowed for some of the best visuals on the system, and made masterful use of the Wii MotionPlus to prove that motion controls were no gimmick. It used these motion controls to the fullest too, resulting in the best swordplay in Zelda's storied history. The puzzles were also some of the best we'd ever seen, and the plot was a treat not just for fans (serving as the first story chronologically), but for newcomers as well. This was the Zelda we were waiting for.\nIf you want to check through Link's adventures, read our list of the best Zelda games of all time.\n1. Super Mario Galaxy 2\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nReleased: 2010\nSuper Mario Galaxy 2 improves over the original in every way - a task we didn't even think was possible - to create not just the best Wii game available, but one of the best Mario games of all time. It pushed the system to its limits with wonderful, mesmerizing visuals and some of the best platforming in history, completely redefining what it even means to be a platformer. Even if you believe it's too similar to the first game, what's wrong with more of an incredibly great thing?\nTo learn more about our pick as the best Wii game of all time, check out our Super Mario Galaxy 2 review.\nIf you're passionate about retro gaming or just want to learn more about it, then you should check out Retro Gamer.
