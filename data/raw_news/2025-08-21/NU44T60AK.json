  "title": "Settlement seems imminent as hairstylist seeks dismissal of sexual abuse lawsuit against Skip Bayless, Fox",
  "description": "The Fox Sports hairstylist who alleged that Skip Bayless offered her $1.5 million for sex asked the court to dismiss her lawsuit. Joy Taylor and Charlie Dixon also are defendants.",
  "content": "The Fox Sports hairstylist who alleged that longtime sports talk show host Skip Bayless made unwanted sexual advances toward her has attempted to have her lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court dismissed, only to be rebuffed by the court.\n\nThe request is an indication the parties have reached a settlement, said Edson McClellan, a lawyer with Rutan & Tucker who specializes in high stakes civil and employment litigation. In addition to Bayless, defendants include parent company Fox Corp. and two additional high-profile former employees at the sports network \u2014 commentator Joy Taylor and executive Charlie Dixon.\n\nMcClellan said the filing for dismissal by plaintiff Noushin Faraji \u201cis a strong indication that a settlement has been reached.\u201d\n\nThe court rejected the request for dismissal because in addition to Faraji alleging sexual battery, retaliation and wrongful termination, the lawsuit added a class action complaint alleging that Fox engaged in \u201cunfair, unlawful, or fraudulent business practices\u201d by failing to pay minimum wages, reimburse business expenses and pay severance to other employees as well.\n\nFor the settlement with Faraji to take place, her lawyers must either refile the lawsuit without the class action complaint or file a declaration explaining why the individual complaint should be dismissed while the class action complaint continues to move forward, according to Alexander R. Wheeler, a partner with the Parris Law Firm.\n\n\u201cThe judge sits in an advisory, almost fiduciary relationship with those who stand to benefit from the class action,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cIf the case was settled to the single plaintiff, the judge might say, \u2018Hold on, what\u2019s the deal with the class action?\u2019 Judges do not want plaintiffs using the threat of class action to extract a better settlement.\u201d\n\nFaraji\u2019s allegations in the 42-page lawsuit filed in January had serious consequences for Bayless, Taylor and Dixon. All three were fired, although Taylor and a lawyer for Dixon said their employment with Fox ended for reasons other than the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cFor over a decade at Fox, Faraji was forced to endure a misogynistic, racist, and ableist workplace where executives and talent were allowed to physically and verbally abuse workers with impunity,\u201d the lawsuit alleged.\n\nFaraji accused Bayless, 73, of offering her $1.5 million to have sex with him. Bayless worked at Fox Sports from 2016 until 2024, when his show \u201cUndisputed\u201d was canceled after a dip in ratings coincided with the departure of his co-host, former NFL star Shannon Sharpe.\n\nIn a separate case, Sharpe in July reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with a woman who accused the Hall of Fame tight end of sexual assault and battery. Sharpe was fired as a commentator on ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take\u201d after the settlement was completed.\n\nFaraji\u2019s lawsuit alleges that Dixon made an unwanted pass at her during a birthday party for Taylor at a Hollywood restaurant in 2017. Faraji told Taylor about the episode, but Taylor responded by saying, \u201cGet over it,\u201d pointing out that \u201cshe herself only had her job because of Mr. Dixon and that Ms. Faraji only had her job because Ms. Taylor requested her,\u201d and \u201cshe warned that Mr. Dixon could take both away,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit also details at length an alleged ongoing affair between Taylor and Dixon as well as a romantic relationship between Taylor and another Fox co-host, Emmanuel Acho.\n\nOn the \u201cHot Mics With Billy Bush\u201d podcast a few days ago, Taylor said the allegations weren\u2019t the reason she was let go by Fox.\n\n\u201cI will say that that situation and that suit had nothing to do with the changes that happened at FS1,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, I think from a logical standpoint, everyone can just look at it and see what the changes were and that there were three shows that were cut.\u201d\n\nIn a court filing denying Faraji\u2019s allegations, Taylor\u2019s attorney wrote that her client \u201cwelcomes the opportunity to publicly prove that her inclusion in this action is improper.\u201d\n\nFaraji accused Dixon, the FS1 executive producer of content, of sexual harassment. Former network anchor and reporter Julie Stewart-Binks also accused him in a separate lawsuit.\n\nAn attorney for Dixon said in a statement emailed to The Times in April that his client had been told by Fox Sports \u201cthat he was being let go for violating company policy\u201d in a matter that had nothing to do with the lawsuits.\n\n\u201cAccording to the network, Mr. Dixon did not disclose to human resources or the legal department that a third-party production company had hired his wife as a temporary freelancer,\u201d attorney John Ly wrote.\n\nBayless denied \u201ceach and every allegation\u201d made by Faraji in a court filing in February, asserting that he \u201cacted with a good faith belief that he had good cause to act as he did\u201d and none of his actions \u201cwere in bad faith, spiteful, malicious, or otherwise motivated by any ill-will or illegal intent.\u201d\n\nFaraji alleged that Bayless made repeated unwanted advances toward her during and after she gave him weekly haircuts, and he offered to pay her for sex.\n\n\u201cMr. Bayless began finding excuses to touch Ms. Faraji,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cHe would give her lingering hugs after each haircut, putting his body against her own, pressing against her breasts. He then began to kiss her on her cheeks. Ms. Faraji was uncomfortable by the physical contact and would make excuses to leave right after the haircuts.\u201d\n\nIn July 2021, the lawsuit states, Faraji explained to Bayless that she was undergoing biopsies to determine whether she had cancer. \u201cMr. Bayless then grabbed her hands, began kissing them, and offered her $1.5 million to have sex,\u201d according to the lawsuit. \u201cApproximately one week later, Mr. Bayless made another advance at Ms. Faraji. Ms. Faraji responded: \u2018Skip, stop, you have a wife.\u2019\u201d\n\nLawyers for Fox and the defendants went through mediation in March but could not resolve the case, according to a court filing in April. Faraji\u2019s lawyers wrote that \u201cwhile the parties did not resolve at mediation, they are continuing to engage in settlement discussions with the mediator.\u201d\n\nLaurie L. Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School and former federal prosecutor, said a settlement likely would be imminent once the class action portion of the lawsuit is addressed to the judge\u2019s satisfaction and the individual complaint is dismissed. Non-disclosure agreements could keep the details from being made public.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who is paying what,\u201d she said. \u201cWere admissions involved? So many cases like this involve non-disclosures. But having gone through mediation, it sounds like they went a long way toward reaching a settlement, and they are at that stage now.\u201d",

      "text": "Dodgers Dugout: The 10 best center fielders in Dodger history\n- Share via\nHi, and welcome to another edition of Dodgers Dugout. My name is Houston Mitchell. On Friday, we\u2019ll see how they did in the four games against the Rockies and look at the final Padres series of the season. But until then, here\u2019s a bonus edition of the newsletter.\nTop 10 center fielders\nHere are my picks for the top 10 center fielders in Dodgers history, followed by how all of you voted. Numbers listed are with the Dodgers only. Click on the player\u2019s name to be taken to the baseball-reference.com page with all their stats.\n1. Duke Snider (1947-62, .300/.384/.553, 142 OPS+, seven-time All Star)\nSnider is known primarily as a power hitter, but he also led the NL in runs three times, in walks once and in OB% once. He also led the league in homers in 1956 with 43 and in RBIs in 1955 with 136. He hit 40 or more homers in five consecutive seasons and it can be argued that he is the greatest player in Dodgers history. He also hit four home runs in the 1955 World Series and 11 World Series homers overall. Snider grew up in Compton and went to Compton High, where the Dodgers discovered him and signed him for $750 after he graduated before the 1943 season. He was assigned to the minors and developed a reputation as a bit of a crybaby, once demanding he be sent to another team after a manager flashed him the take sign. He joined the Dodgers in 1947 and was a part-time player for a couple of seasons. Branch Rickey took him under his wing in 1948 and helped him improve his plate discipline and his footwork in center field. He became the starting center fielder in 1949 and quickly became one of the better players in the league. When the Dodgers moved to L.A. in 1958, injuries and the Coliseum, with its\u2019 430-foot distance to right-center, hurt his power somewhat. Snider hit only 15 homers in 1958 and 23 in 1959. He then became a part-time player again, but is the first Dodger to get a hit in Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers sold him to the New York Mets in 1963 and he retired after a season with the San Francisco Giants in 1964. It took him several tries to be elected to the Hall of Fame, finally breaking through with 86% of the votes in 1980. Snider died in Escondido on Feb. 27, 2011.\n2. Willie Davis (1960-73, .279/.312/.413, 107 OPS+,two-time All Star, 3 Gold Gloves)\nDavis was an outstanding defensive player who led the NL in triples twice (1962 with 10 and 1970 with 16) and whose offensive numbers don\u2019t look as impressive as they should because he played during one of the biggest pitchers eras in baseball history. His best season was probably 1969, when he hit .311 with 23 doubles, eight triples and 11 homers, or it could have been 1962, when he hit .285 with 18 doubles, 10 triples and 21 homers, or 1971, when he hit .309 with 33 doubles, 10 triples and 10 homers. He didn\u2019t walk much and had moderate power, but he caught everything hit to him (except for that one game in the 1966 World Series, but let\u2019s not get into that). He is still the L.A. Dodgers\u2019 career leader in runs (1,004), hits (2,091) and triples (110). He was traded to the Montreal Expos after the 1973 season for reliever Mike Marshall and retired after the 1979 season. Davis played in the majors for 18 seasons and had over 2,500 hits, but strangely never appeared on the Hall of Fame ballot. Not that he would have made it, but he certainly deserved to be up for consideration. He died in Burbank on March 9, 2010.\n3. Pete Reiser (1940-42, 1946-48, .306/.384/.460, 132 OPS+, three-time All Star)\nPete Reiser never met an outfield fence he didn\u2019t like crashing into and it may have cost him a Hall of Fame career. After playing in 58 games with the Dodgers in 1940, Reiser came into his own in 1941 when he hit a league-leading .343 to go with 117 runs, 39 doubles, 17 triples, 14 homers and 76 RBIs. He also played great defense in center. That got him second place in NL MVP voting behind teammate Dolph Camilli (Reiser should have won). Reiser led the league in nine categories. He followed that by hitting .310 with 33 doubles and 10 homers in 1942, leading the league with 20 steals and making his second straight All-Star team. However, on July 18 of that year, he crashed full speed into the center field fence while chasing a fly ball. He ended up with a separated shoulder and fractured skull. In those days though, you didn\u2019t let little things like a fractured skull slow you down. He returned to the lineup a week later, but he wasn\u2019t the same. He hit .244 the rest of the season. He then enlisted in the Army and spent three years there. Reiser returned to the majors in 1946 and broke his leg while stealing second. He crashed into the fence in St. Louis and missed some time. But he still led the league with 34 steals, though his batting average dropped to .277. In 1947, he was chasing another fly ball when he crashed into the wall face-first. This caused another fractured skull. He was given the Last Rites by a priest in the hospital before making a miraculous recovery. He ended up playing 110 games that season. He was a bench player the following season, as he had put on a little weight and had been slowed tremendously by his numerous injuries. The Dodgers traded him to the Boston Braves after the season for Nanny Fernandez and Mike McCormick. He retired after the 1952 season and came back to the Dodger organization as a roving minor-league hitting instructor. He joined Walter Alston\u2019s coaching staff in L.A. in 1960 and helped tutor Maury Wills on how to steal bases. Reiser had a heart attack in 1965, went on as an assistant coach for other teams. Reiser, who smoked a pack of cigarettes a day throughout his adult life, died of emphysema in Palm Springs in 1981. He was only 62.\n4. Matt Kemp (2006-14, 2018, .292/.348/.494, 127 OPS+, three-time All Star, two Gold Gloves)\nI won\u2019t write too much on Kemp since I assume everyone knows a lot about him. His arthritic hips robbed him of his speed, so if you only know him from his 2018 return, keep in mind that he stole 40 bases in 2011, 35 in 2008 and 34 in 2009. He never really had a bad season with the team, it\u2019s just that his best seasons were so good that his other seasons looked bad in comparison. He was robbed of the MVP award in 2011, finishing second to Ryan Braun of Milwaukee, who was later suspended for 65 games for violating baseball\u2019s drug policy. Kemp had a better season than Braun.\n5. Mike Griffin (1891-98, .305/.399/.416, 125 OPS+)\nIt\u2019s really hard to compare players from the 19th century to players much later, because it was such a different game. But Griffin was great and deserves a spot in the top 10.\nGriffin score 100 or more runs in six of his eight season in Brooklyn, stole 264 bases and was considered the finest fielding center fielder of his day. In 1894, he hit a career-high .357. He was named team captain in 1895. But his career ended strangely.\nBrooklyn fired manager Bill Barnie during the 1898 season and named Griffin as player-manager. He had that position for four games, decided he didn\u2019t like it and asked to be just a player again. Team president Charles Ebbets became the manager.\nAfter much cajoling, Ebbets convinced Griffin to try and become player-manager again for the 1899 season. He signed a contract for $3,500. What Griffin didn\u2019t know was that Brooklyn was having financial problems, as was Baltimore, so Ebbets (who was wealthy) bought the Baltimore club and merged it with Brooklyn. Baltimore was managed by Ned Hanlon, considered a top manager. Ebbets no longer needed Griffin as a manager, and sent him a new contract for $2,800 as just a player. Griffin refused, saying he had a signed contract for $3,500. In March, 1899, Ebbets sent Griffin a telegram that stated: \u201cYou have been released to the Cleveland club. They wish you to report to Cleveland on Monday, to go with team to Hot Springs. Personally I wish you the best of luck in your new position.\u201d\nGriffin said he wouldn\u2019t play for Cleveland. After two weeks of fighting over it, with various lawyers involved, Cleveland sold his contract to St. Louis. He never reported there, instead announcing his retirement and suing Ebbets for breach of contract. The New York State Supreme Court ruled in Griffin\u2019s favor. But Griffin never played in the majors again. He died in 1908 of pneumonia. He was 47.\n6. Cody Bellinger (2017-22, .248/.332/.487, 118 OPS+, two-time All Star, 2017 Rookie of the Year, 2019 NL MVP, one Gold Glove)\nAfter his first four seasons, it seemed possible that Bellinger was going to be the best position player in Dodgers history and a first-ballot Hall of Famer. Then, while celebrating a home run in the 2020 World Series, he and Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez high-fived so strongly that Bellinger separated his shoulder. He was never the same after that, hitting .165 in 2021 and .210 in 2022. The Dodgers had little interest in re-signing him as a free agent, and he has since played for the Cubs and Yankees, putting together solid seasons for both teams. But he has never again reached the heights he once reached.\n7. Johnny Frederick (1929-34, .308/.357/.477, 117 OPS+)\nThere\u2019s not a lot out there about Frederick. What is known was dug up by baseball historian Graham Womack: Frederick came into the league as a 27-year-old rookie in 1929 and led the league with 52 doubles (to go with 24 homers). He followed it up by hitting .334 with 44 doubles, 11 triples and 17 homers. Then Rawlings introduced a cork-cushioned baseball to the majors and Frederick\u2019s power slowly began to slip. He was out of the majors for good when the Dodgers traded him to a minor-league team in 1934 for Frenchy Bordagaray. In 1935, he hit .363 for Sacramento. He then hit .322 over five years with the Portland Beavers, who made him player manager for his 19th and final professional season in 1940. Frederick finished his minor league career with 2,467 hits. Add that to his major league total, and Frederick had 3,421 hits in his pro career. He died in 1977 in Tigard, Ore., at the age of 75. You can read much more about Frederick here.\n8. Jim Wynn (1974-75, .261/.394/.463, 144 OPS+, two-time All Star)\nWynn might be a little too high here, but he was my first favorite player on the Dodgers, so here he is.\nThe Dodgers acquired Wynn from the Astros before the 1974 season for Claude Osteen. Wynn got off to a fast start and became a fan favorite, with the bleachers in left center being dubbed \u201cCannon Country,\u201d after Wynn\u2019s nickname, \u201cThe Toy Cannon.\u201d\nWynn hit .271 with 32 homers and 108 RBIs in 1974 while leading the Dodgers to the World Series. Honestly, he should have won the MVP award that season, but he finished fifth to Steve Garvey,\nHe got off to a good start in 1975, hitting .270 with 14 homers at the All-Star break, but slumped after that. The Dodgers, always ones at that time to trade a player a season too soon rather than a season too late, sent him to Atlanta for Dusty Baker.\nStrangely, Wynn is probably best remembered by Dodgers fans for a play in the 1974 World Series.\nUsually a standout defender, Wynn hurt his right shoulder making a diving catch near the end of the season, and his throwing arm after that had all the strength of a wet paper towel.\nKnowing this, right fielder Joe Ferguson and Wynn had a deal. If a ball was hit between them and a runner was on third, Ferguson would make the catch with the hope his stronger arm would hold the runner, or that he could throw them out trying to score.\nGame 1 of the World Series reached the eighth inning, with Oakland leading, 3-1. With Sal Bando on third for the A\u2019s, Reggie Jackson hit a fly ball to right center. With a left-hander up, Wynn was playing toward right-center, and Ferguson was closer to the right-field line, so it looked like Wynn\u2019s ball all the way.\nWynn set himself for the catch, when at the last second Ferguson, who started racing over as soon as the ball was hit, cut in front of him, made the catch, and threw a perfect strike to catcher Steve Yeager 300 feet away. Bando barreled over Yeager, who held on to the ball for the out.\nSome Dodger fans, even now, think Ferguson was just trying to show up Wynn, which isn\u2019t true.\n\u201cI called to him that I could take it and he said \u2018Go ahead,\u2019 \u201d Ferguson said.\nAsked if that was true, Wynn responded \u201cYep. Wasn\u2019t that one tremendous throw? It hurt my arm just to look at it.\u201d\n9. Brett Butler (.298/.392/.368, 112 OPS+, one-time All Star)\nButler was a pest. He seemed to be on base all the time, ran the bases with reckless abandon and scored 80-100 runs every season. Signed as a free agent, Butler made the All-Star team in his first season with the Dodgers and led the league with 112 runs and 108 walks. His on-base percentage topped .400 three times with L.A. and he played solid defense. He was caught stealing a little too often (28 times in 1991 compared to 38 stolen bases), but he\u2019s the type of player you don\u2019t see too often in the game today. In May of 1996, Butler was diagnosed with cancer of the tonsils. He underwent treatment and returned to the lineup in September. He played one more season with the team and retired.\n10. Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez (2015-20, 2023-current, .236/.303/.413, 93 OPS+)\nI\u2019ve written tons about Hern\u00e1ndez. With the Dodgers, he has played at least 50 games at every position for the Dodgers, except pitcher (where he has appeared 10 times) and catcher (zero). One of the biggest fan favorites in Dodger history, he becomes an entirely different hitter in the postseason, where he has hit .278/.353/.522 in 75 postseason games with the Dodgers, including 10 homers and 26 RBIs.\nThe readers\u2019 top 10\n1,302 ballots were sent in.

      "text": "Former Fox Sports anchor alleges network executive sexually assaulted her in 2016\n- Share via\nFormer Fox Sports anchor and reporter Julie Stewart-Binks has accused one of her ex-bosses at the network of sexually assaulting her on a balcony outside his Marina del Rey hotel room in 2016.\nA lawsuit filed Friday in Los Angeles County Superior Court alleges that FS1 executive producer of content Charlie Dixon held Stewart-Binks against a wall, \u201cforcefully\u201d pressed his body against hers and \u201ctried to force his tongue into her mouth\u201d after the two originally got together to discuss plans for an upcoming show.\nStewart-Binks eventually slipped away from Dixon, the lawsuit states, but soon after the incident her contract with Fox was not renewed. In June 2017, after she had finished working for Fox, Stewart-Binks was interviewed by the network\u2019s human resources department as part of an investigation into a different Fox executive, according to the filing.\nDuring that interview, the lawsuit states, Stewart-Binks informed HR of the alleged incident involving Dixon and said he was the one they should be investigating. Instead of taking action, the lawsuit alleges, \u201cFox egregiously made the deliberate decision to protect Dixon and allow a sexual predator to remain an executive at Fox for nearly a decade.\u201d\nNoushin Faraji has accused ex-Fox Sports host Skip Bayless of making unwanted sexual advances toward her, including offering the hairstylist $1.5 million to have sex with him, a lawsuit states.\nThe lawsuit alleges sexual assault and sexual battery as causes of action against all defendants, which include Dixon, Fox Sports and its parent company, Fox Corp.\nThe Times was unable to reach Dixon through Fox Sports. Asked by The Times about the lawsuit and its allegations, Fox Sports emailed a statement: \u201cThese allegations are from over eight years ago. At the time, we promptly hired a third-party firm to investigate and addressed the matter based on their findings.\u201d\nFox didn\u2019t disclose the results of the third-party investigation.\nStewart-Binks was hired as an anchor and reporter for the upstart FS1 in 2013. Some of her duties with the network included hosting a daily soccer show, reporting from the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and serving as the Ducks sideline reporter in 2014. In early 2016, the lawsuit states, Fox Sports host Jason Whitlock expressed interest in having Stewart-Binks appear on the show he\u2019d be hosting during Super Bowl week.\nAccording to the filing, Stewart-Binks met with Dixon on the evening of Jan. 27, 2016, at a hotel bar to discuss the executive\u2019s thoughts for Whitlock\u2019s show. But the conversation took a bizarre turn, the lawsuit states, as Dixon made such comments to Stewart-Binks as \u201cyou\u2019re not funny, interesting, or talented\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re not hot enough to be a hot girl on TV.\u201d\nAt last call, the complaint states, Dixon invited Stewart up to his room for a beer and to see the view \u2014 an offer she initially declined but then \u201creluctantly\u201d accepted.\nThe three sports talk voices, who all once worked at Fox Sports, discuss a hairstylist\u2019s lawsuit against Skip Bayless, Joy Taylor and Charlie Dixon.\n\u201cAs Ms. Stewart-Binks stood on the balcony looking out into the darkness, Dixon swiftly pushed her against the wall and pinned her arms to her side,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cWith her arms forcefully held down and his body pressed against hers, Dixon tried to force his tongue into her mouth. Ms. Stewart-Binks sealed her mouth shut.\n\u201cDixon ignored her, continuing to press against her body and lick her closed mouth. While keeping one of her arms pinned, he moved his other arm from pressing her upper elbow against the wall to her body and towards her chest. Ms. Stewart-Binks seized the moment of partial freedom to push him away, say \u2018get off of me,\u2019 and rapidly leave the hotel room.\u201d\nAccording to the lawsuit, Stewart-Binks called her mother on the way home and told her what allegedly had happened. \u201cThe two agreed that it would be wiser for Ms. Stewart-Binks to remain silent rather than risk the career she had worked so hard to build,\u201d the complaint states.\nStewart-Binks got the job for Whitlock\u2019s show, but several weeks later she was informed by her agents that Fox had decided not to renew her contract. Since then, Stewart-Binks has continued to work in the industry, including gigs for ESPN and other outlets, but the lawsuit states that \u201con information and belief, she suspects that after she left Fox, Dixon continued to leverage his connections to undermine her career.\u201d\nStewart-Binks is seeking unspecified damages, as well as \u201cinjunctive relief, including but not limited to directing Fox to take immediate and effective measures to prevent any current or future sexual assault and battery. At a minimum, this should involve terminating the responsible individuals, as well as those who enabled or protected them, without severance.\u201d\nEarlier this month, Dixon, Fox Sports and Fox Corp. were among the defendants in a civil lawsuit filed by hairstylist Noushin Faraji in L.A. County Superior Court. That lawsuit \u2014 which also named former Fox Sports host Skip Bayless and current host Joy Taylor as defendants \u2014 alleges Faraji \u201cwas forced to endure a misogynistic, racist, and ableist workplace where executives and talent were allowed to physically and verbally abuse workers with impunity\u201d during her decade-plus working at the network.\nAccording to Stewart-Binks\u2019 complaint, she reached out to Faraji after the hairdresser filed her lawsuit to see how she could help. \u201cMs. Faraji simply asked that Ms. Stewart-Binks tell her story to the world,\u201d the complaint states."

      "text": "Shannon Sharpe will not return to ESPN: \u2018They did what they felt they needed to do\u2019\n- Share via\nShannon Sharpe will not be returning to ESPN.\nThe development comes weeks after the former NFL star settled a $50-million lawsuit that accused him of rape. The Athletic was the first to report Wednesday that Sharpe won\u2019t be returning to ESPN. Sharpe confirmed the news that night on his \u201cNightcap\u201d podcast.\n\u201cI really enjoyed my time at ESPN,\u201d Sharpe, who addressed the matter for about two minutes at the beginning of the show, said. \u201cIt gave me an opportunity to bring my audience that saw me really just grow. ... So I\u2019m very, very grateful for that.\u201d\nSharpe indicated that the decision came from the network. ESPN declined to comment for this article.\n\u201cThey did what they felt they needed to do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m at peace with that.\u201d\nSharpe, 56, first appeared on \u201cFirst Take\u201d in August 2023, following a seven-year run as a co-host on FS1\u2019s \u201cUndisputed.\u201d In June 2024, he signed a multiyear contract with ESPN that expanded his role on \u201cFirst Take\u201d and other shows.\nIn a lawsuit filed on April 20 in Clark County in Nevada, Sharpe\u2019s accuser sought damages for claims of assault, sexual assault, battery, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress after multiple alleged nonconsensual sexual encounters in her Las Vegas apartment between October and January.\nSharpe has denied the allegations. He announced days after the lawsuit was filed that he was temporarily stepping away from his duties as a commentator on \u201cFirst Take\u201d but would return in time for the 2025 NFL season.\nAt that time, an ESPN spokesperson said in a statement emailed to The Times that \u201cthis is a serious situation, and we agree with Shannon\u2019s decision to step away.\u201d\nSharpe has remained on his popular podcasts \u201cClub Shay Shay\u201d and \u201cNightcap.\u201d\nAttorney Tony Buzbee, whose firm represented the woman who filed the civil lawsuit against Sharpe earlier this year, announced the settlement on July 18 in a statement posted on Instagram.\nSharpe\u2019s legal team said at the time that Buzbee\u2019s statement should be considered the \u201cfinal word\u201d on the matter. Terms of the settlement have not been disclosed.\nA $50-million lawsuit that accused Shannon Sharpe of rape has been settled. \u2018All matters have now been addressed satisfactorily, and the matter is closed,\u2019 the accuser\u2019s attorney said.\nOn Wednesday, Sharpe said he regretted that the news about his departure from ESPN surfaced days before his older brother, former Green Bay Packers great Sterling Sharpe, is being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\u201cI hate the fact that I\u2019m overshadowing my brother \u2014 the first two brothers in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and this is what the headline is going to be for the next couple of days,\u201d Shannon Sharpe, who was inducted in 2011, said.\n\u201cSo, Bro, again, I know you told me that I don\u2019t have to apologize, but I\u2019m going to do it one final time tonight, and I won\u2019t apologize again. I\u2019m sorry that I upstaged you in this manner. You know that was never my intent. You\u2019ve been my hero. You\u2019ve been my role model from as long as I can remember, and I apologize.\u201d"

      "text": "Skip Bayless rising early, promises \u2018deeper\u2019 debate for new Fox Sports 1 show\n- Share via\nIt\u2019s Skip Bayless\u2019 job to be polarizing.\nYou love him, hate him or share both feelings within the same window of his two-hour sports debate show.\nBayless, 64, makes no secret of his intention to resume the same type of combative discussion on Fox Sports 1\u2019s new \u201cSkip and Shannon Undisputed\u201d with co-host Shannon Sharpe that he did with partner Stephen A. Smith on ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take.\u201d\n\u201cSkip and Shannon Undisputed\u201d debuts Sept. 6 at 7 a.m. Pacific.\nFor Bayless, the show marks a return to work in Los Angeles following his 1976-78 stint as a take-out feature reporter for The Times\u2019 Sports section.\n\u201cI was there back in the day when the section operated like a daily magazine, a bottomless pit of space,\u201d Bayless said. \u201cMy stories would be 3,000 to 4,000 words long and they\u2019d jump six or seven times through the section.\n\u201cI think those days have passed because no one read them to the bottom anyway. It was a great ride. It was the best sports magazine in the country and it was a newspaper. Those were the days.\u201d\nWith The Times, Bayless won a horse racing writing Eclipse Award for documenting Seattle Slew\u2019s 1977 Triple Crown victory, and he gained a national sports columnist position at the Dallas Morning News at age 25.\n\u201cWhen I used to travel from The Times and touch down at LAX, I\u2019d always say, \u2018I\u2019m home, this is where I belong.\u2019 I fell completely in love with L.A., felt like this was where I was destined to be,\u201d Bayless said. \u201cWhen I left, I always said to myself, \u2018If I ever get the shot to get back to L.A., I\u2019m taking it.\u2019\u201d\nBayless said that \u201cbillion-to-one shot\u201d was realized this year when former ESPN executive Jamie Horowitz became president of Santa Monica-based Fox Sports National Networks.\nHe began stirring it up in L.A. last week, taking to a Fairfax Avenue barber shop to talk sports with fans who came in for a cut. Bayless defended the abilities of Tim Tebow and opined that Aaron Rodgers is overrated considering his mixed playoff results.\nGiven the multitude of topics discussed through the course of the year, it\u2019s hard to believe anyone can feel so passionate about so many different issues.\nDisney is Mickey and Minnie. Fox is \u2018The Simpsons,\u2019 \u2018Family Guy.\u2019 A different culture.\n\u2014 Skip Bayless\nIt\u2019s Bayless\u2019 commitment to remain deeply aware of all that\u2019s going on in the sports world, striving to have a well-researched, strong position about wherever that day\u2019s conversation steers.\nIn sticking with his schedule when he was based in Bristol, Conn., Bayless will rise each morning at 2 a.m. Pacific time to catch up with whatever happenings he missed by going to bed at 9 p.m., sharpening himself for the coming debate with Sharpe.\nUnlike Smith (or Bayless), Sharpe brings the cache of playing experience. The former NFL tight end won three Super Bowl rings and his bust resides in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.\n\u201cI love the matchup with Shannon, [him] having played the game at an extremely high level versus my NFL expertise,\u201d Bayless said. \u201cI live to win these debates and he\u2019ll be a formidable foe.\u201d\nShouldn\u2019t the reporter yield to the athlete\u2019s knowledge in some discussions?\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Bayless said. \u201cI remind you to study the landscape of team building in football, basketball and baseball. The architects of many teams did not play the game at any significant level. I\u2019d start with R.C. Buford of the San Antonio Spurs.\n\u201cThe greatest athletes sometimes make the worst personnel decisions. Witness Michael Jordan.\n\u201cThis will be an ongoing daily conference between me and Shannon. I will never defer to him just because he played the game.\u201d\nAnd Bayless predicts a stronger brand of discussion on Fox.\n\u201cESPN, being owned by Walt Disney \u2026 I just felt a pressure of the last five-six years that I never quite fit,\u201d Bayless said. \u201cI felt like I gave about 75% into our debate. Disney is Mickey and Minnie. Fox is \u2018The Simpsons,\u2019 \u2018Family Guy.\u2019 A different culture.\n\u201cI think Jamie will allow me to go deeper into my arguments, he\u2019ll be behind me and he\u2019ll ignore what I thought was irrelevant criticism from basically just blogger-critics that ESPN seemed to live by.\n\u201cI never could quite understand that. So I often felt on an island, unsupported, and that\u2019s why I wanted to reunite with Jamie \u2013 feeling that would be a great new frontier for me.\u201d\nPart of that outlook will include talk about the UFC, which Fox televises. Bayless attended Conor McGregor\u2019s UFC 202 victory over Nate Diaz earlier this month in Las Vegas.\n\u201cI had kept an arm\u2019s length from the UFC because I thought, \u2018Gee, it sort of bastardized boxing.\u2019 But that main event, that was special stuff,\u201d Bayless said. \u201cIt won me over. A lot of boxing skills were involved.\n\u201cI was overwhelmed by the pain threshold, by the guts and the heart these combatants showed. It was a long fight. I thought one or the other would give up, stay down. They never did. I was extremely impressed.\u201d"

The show will air for two hours, beginning at 10 a.m. ET on Sept. 3. Acho, McCoy and James previously worked on FS1\u2019s afternoon show \u201cSpeak,\u201d while Daniel is a newcomer to the network.\n\u201cBreakfast Ball\u201d will be FS1\u2019s latest attempt at an early morning show beginning at 8 a.m. ET. Craig Carton, who\u2019s had a FS1 morning show since 2022, will be joined by Fox NFL analyst Mark Schlereth and Danny Parkins, who recently hosted an afternoon radio sports talk show in Chicago.\n\u201cBreakfast Ball\u201d will launch on Monday starting at 12 p.m. ET for the first week because \u201cThe Herd with Colin Cowherd\u201d will be on vacation.\n\u201cUndisputed\u201d aired Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m.-12 p.m. ET from September 2016 until Aug. 2, when Bayless announced on social media that he was leaving the show and the network. Ratings for the show had plummeted over the past year after Shannon Sharpe left for ESPN and it went to rotating co-hosts instead of one-on-one debates.\nThe 72-year old Bayless still has a weekly podcast, but has not announced any future plans.\nThe afternoon lineup of \u201cThe Herd,\u201d \u201cFirst Things First\u201d and \u201cSpeak\u201d remain in its same time slots. \u201cSpeak,\u201d a two-hour program that starts at 5 p.m. ET, will have Keyshawn Johnson and Paul Pierce joining Joy Taylor.\n___\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/sports"

      "text": "- Share via\nReactions to the allegations in a lawsuit that longtime Fox Sports talk show host Skip Bayless sexually harassed his hairstylist and that FS1 host Joy Taylor had romantic relationships with two prominent co-workers are littering social media.\nIt was no surprise that three of the most prominent voices in sports talk television \u2014 all of whom previously worked at Fox Sports \u2014 cleared their throats and let it fly.\nFor Marcellus Wiley, a former NFL player who worked at FS1, the lawsuit confirmed what he already suspected.\nFormer Fox Sports host Jason Whitlock congratulated himself for being wary of women in the network\u2019s makeup room, then went over the top with sexist comments about Taylor.\nAnd Stephen A. Smith, who pioneered debate sports TV with Bayless on ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take\u201d from 2012 to 2016 and worked at Fox from 2009 to 2011, essentially became a character witness for Bayless while underscoring that the lawsuit should be taken seriously.\nFox Sports hairstylist Noushin Faraji filed the 42-page lawsuit \u2014 first reported by Front Office Sports \u2014 in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleging that Bayless propositioned her for years and offered to pay her $1.5 million for sex. She also described a toxic work environment at Fox Sports in L.A., alleging that Taylor engaged in romantic relationships with executive vice president Charlie Dixon and Emmanuel Acho, an ex-NFL player who co-hosted \u201cSpeak for Yourself\u201d on FS1 with Taylor and LeSean McCoy from 2022 to 2023.\nNoushin Faraji has accused ex-Fox Sports host Skip Bayless of making unwanted sexual advances toward her, including offering the hairstylist $1.5 million to have sex with him, a lawsuit states.\nAcho apparently deleted a 2022 social media video in which he promoted the launch of the show by praising Taylor. In the video he said, \u201cDo you all realize how hard it is to get into the position she is in? So often there is misogyny and sexism running rampant in sports and we don\u2019t even care what women have to say in sports.\n\u201cBut Joy is not only in the position on TV as a Black woman, but as an opinionist, so not just asking men what they think but adding her own unique and distinct insight. It\u2019s hard to do, but Joy, you have done it. ... Joy, congratulations and look forward to working with you.\u201d\nWiley, who co-hosted \u201cSpeak for Yourself\u201d from 2018 to 2022, first with Whitlock then with Acho, addressed the lawsuit on his podcast, saying, \u201cI never heard that Charlie Dixon and Joy Taylor were sleeping together. But, upon hearing that, I\u2019m not gonna lie to y\u2019all. It makes a lot of things make sense. It unlocks a lot for me.\n\u201cSleeping with Emmanuel Acho? I\u2019ve heard that before. Multiple times, as recent as a week or two ago. Part of the reason it was suggested that they do a show together is because of these allegations in the lawsuit that they were sleeping together, conspiring to get that to go. Conspiring with Charlie, conspiring with Emmanuel Acho, \u2018Let\u2019s make this work.\u2019\u201d\nWiley apparently was referring to a recent flurry of movement on Fox Sports talk shows. He had been replaced by Taylor and McCoy in the rebranded \u201cSpeak\u201d in 2022. But last August, Acho and McCoy moved to \u201cUndisputed\u201d to replace Bayless, who was let go because of declining ratings. Keyshawn Johnson and Paul Pierce, who were working with Bayless on \u201cUndisputed,\u201d moved to the rebranded \u201cSpeak\u201d with Taylor.\n\u201cUnlocking the piece of Charlie,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cIf true, I\u2019m looking at my history and I\u2019m looking at the history of a lot of other talents on that network a lot differently. A lot differently in a really bad way. ... Imagine if Charlie is allegedly sleeping with Joy Taylor and Emmanuel Acho and there\u2019s somebody who\u2019s not sleeping with Joy Taylor.\u201d\nRoger Ailes\u2019 ouster as chairman of Fox News amid a sexual harassment scandal in July 2016 ended the career of one of the most powerful and controversial figures in American media.\nWhitlock, on his podcast \u201cFearless,\u201d reflected on his time and interactions with Faraji while at Fox Sports while also making disparaging comments about Taylor.\n\u201cI was a fan of Noushin, thought she was a good person,\u201d Whitlock said. \u201cDid I think that Noushin and all the women in hair and makeup at Fox Sports needed to be handled carefully? Yes, yes I did. Anybody that knew me and knew my reputation at Fox Sports, it was like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to come into this makeup room, I\u2019m going to say very little. Because I\u2019m not going to give any of you leverage over me.\u2019\u201d\nWhen Whitlock turned his attention to Taylor, however, he attempted to make her alleged romantic relationships with co-workers a symbol of what he perceives as societal ills. Then he made questionable personal comments about her physical appearance that The Times won\u2019t repeat.\n\u201cJoy Taylor is a symbol of this whole feminist movement, this whole Black queens movement, this whole DEI movement,\u201d he said. \u201cThis whole sharing everything with women, and, \u2018Hey there\u2019s gotta be a woman host on all of these shows.\u2019 Well, there\u2019s consequences to that, and this whole system has been set up to create the kind of chaos and division and inefficiency and corruption that we\u2019re seeing spelled out in this lawsuit, [and] all across American media.\n\u201cI basically, for the most part, just kept my distance from Joy Taylor. Not because I didn\u2019t like her, just because I knew myself. I know what I\u2019m capable of. ... Like, \u2018Jay, keep your distance, that\u2019s going to get you into trouble.\u2019\u201d\nJenny Cavnar has been named the primary play-by-play announcer for the Oakland Athletics this season. She\u2019s the first woman to hold such a role for an MLB team.\nSmith, by comparison, took the high road on his podcast, \u201cThe Stephen A. Smith Show,\u201d saying that while he is \u201cheartbroken\u201d for his former colleague Bayless, he has zero knowledge about the veracity of Faraji\u2019s allegations.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been in that [Fox Sports] building in more than 20 years, I\u2019m not here to castigate Ms. Faraji. I don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve known Skip for just as long and I can\u2019t imagine it. The Skip Bayless I know has a hard time giving away $15. He\u2019s one of the cheapest people I know. ... Imagining him in this position is shocking to say the least, and all I could tell you is that it\u2019s not the Skip Bayless I know.\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that I have any inside knowledge of this \u2014 I don\u2019t. And I\u2019m not going to get involved. It\u2019s incredibly dicey for people who don\u2019t know to act like they know. \u201d\nSmith did add that people he\u2019s spoken to \u201cthat have some knowledge\u201d about Faraji say her allegations shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly.\n\u201cThis person who is a hairstylist, the people that I\u2019ve spoken to in the last 24 hours that have some knowledge about her say that she\u2019s meticulous with her details and she\u2019s going to chronicle things and that\u2019s how she operates,\u201d he said.\nThe star of \u201cFirst Take\u201d has been taking on issues beyond sports through his podcast and on cable news networks, some of which have offered contributor roles, he says."

Early in his career, Wheeler was part of a trial team that secured $370 million-dollar on behalf of workers who suffered defamation and emotional distress at the hands of Guess?

      "text": "- Share via\nDemetrice Martin built an early, practically insurmountable lead.\nLanding six defensive backs by Christmas, the UCLA secondary coach added two more before the spring transfer portal window closed, making this race appear to be a runaway.\nBefore long, a formidable challenger emerged. Closing fast in the battle to become the Bruins\u2019 top recruiter on an almost entirely new coaching staff was Andy Kwon.\nHaving helped snag four transfers \u2014 a few of whom committed before his hiring \u2014 the offensive line coach went on to secure verbal commitments from two four-star high school prospects from Florida, the kind of highly coveted out-of-region talent that UCLA had seen go elsewhere in recent years.\nA judge denies injunction requests from DJ Wingfield and Kaedin Robinson in their NCAA lawsuits, all but blocking them from playing for USC and UCLA this fall.\nThe heated duel to see who could secure the best players, which included every new assistant and holdovers Ikaika Malloe and Jerry Neuheisel, was a welcome surprise to coach DeShaun Foster.\n\u201cTo be honest with you, I didn\u2019t know they were going to compete about the recruiting the way that they\u2019re doing,\u201d Foster said recently of his new assistants. \u201cI knew that they like to recruit, but they\u2019re competing.\u201d\nSo who\u2019s atop the leaderboard?\n\u201cMeat came out of the blocks hot for a little bit,\u201d Foster said, referring to Martin\u2019s nickname, \u201cand then Andy came in, so I\u2019m gonna think right now it\u2019s Andy, and then coach Meat.\u201d\nAlong the way, the assistants understood that crossing the finish line first meant they would be helping everybody win.\nUCLA\u2019s 2026 recruiting class that is ranked No. 22 nationally by 247Sports.com is on pace to become the Bruins\u2019 best since they finished No. 19 in 2018, the latter success largely a result of the efforts of the staff that was in place before coach Chip Kelly\u2019s arrival.\n\u201cIf they win some games this year and look competitive,\u201d said Greg Biggins, a national recruiting analyst for 247Sports.com, \u201cthey could really have a legitimate top-20 recruiting class.\u201d\nKwon and Martin faced plenty of worthy competition in their bid to reach the top. Safeties coach Gabe Lynn offered a huge assist in helping Martin restock the secondary. Offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Tino Sunseri aided Foster and others in the acquisition of Nico Iamaleava, the biggest catch of the spring. Running backs coach A.J. Steward and wide receivers coach Burl Toler III were part of a combined effort to bring in tailback Jaivian Thomas, the prized transfer tailback from California who knew Toler when Toler was an assistant with the Golden Bears.\nOn it went, the entire staff working to outdo one another in service of the team.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been awesome,\u201d said Malloe, the defensive coordinator who helped defensive line coach Jethro Franklin import four transfers. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s like the whole, you know, who wants to win the knife set, right? Who\u2019s gonna get that prize? And I think our coaching staff is so competitive that as a byproduct of it, we\u2019re starting to bring in guys that really fit our culture and then talent-wise, we\u2019re bringing in guys that I think we\u2019re thankful for.\u201d\nThe expected payoff from the next high school class is more than a decent season ending in a bowl game; the Bruins are vying for something unprecedented.\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to get a playoff run with my class,\u201d said Cooper Javorsky, an offensive lineman from San Juan Hills High who committed in June, \u201cso the image I have being in my head is with my class, we\u2019re going to try to do great things and take it as far as we can.\u201d\nJavorsky is one of three offensive linemen in the class alongside tackle Johnnie Jones and interior offensive lineman Micah Smith, the four-star Floridians. Biggins cautioned that players from the East Coast can be hard to hold onto \u2014 Jones has reportedly scheduled a visit to Florida State for the Seminoles\u2019 season opener against Alabama.\n\u201cI always say that there\u2019s a danger in recruiting out of region because it\u2019s harder to babysit those guys,\u201d Biggins said, \u201cand you\u2019ve got to know that those local schools out there are going to stay on those guys the whole entire year, and if UCLA starts to slip up a little bit, then those schools are going to be all over them.\u201d\nIf Jones and Smith crave honest critiques about what they need to do to live up to their billing, maybe they\u2019ll stick with their commitments. Kwon has developed a reputation as a straight shooter who isn\u2019t afraid to sling some verbal darts in his efforts to maximize players\u2019 talent.\n\u201cHe was very honest with me, you know, he wasn\u2019t lying to me about anything, he spoke to me exactly how it was,\u201d Javorsky said. \u201cLike, when I went on my official [visit], he wasn\u2019t just hyping me up and all that, he was telling me stuff I did wrong and stuff he\u2019s going to help me fix.\u201d\nJavorsky\u2019s to-do list? Staying low in his blocks and developing proper hand placement and footwork will be top priorities upon his enrollment before spring practice in 2026. Guard Julian Armella, a transfer from Florida State who projects as one of at least three new starters on the offensive line, said it\u2019s common for players to stay after practice or meet individually with Kwon to perfect their technique.\nAs part of coach DeShaun Foster\u2019s efforts to connect a team featuring 55 new players and eight new assistant coaches, everyone participated in brotherhood meetings.\nAs far as Martin\u2019s recruiting success goes, these are far from the first wins he\u2019s logged in Westwood. The veteran has nearly attained legendary status after being part of a staff that brought in six consecutive top-20 recruiting classes under coach Jim Mora. A personable demeanor that helps him relate to players, parents and high school coaches is among Martin\u2019s biggest assets.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fun to talk to, he\u2019s high-energy, he\u2019s easy to talk with, he\u2019s very intelligent,\u201d Biggins said. \u201cSo if you want to talk scheme, you can do that. If you want to talk \u2014 coaches nowadays, you always hear kids saying, \u2018Hey, we talked forever and it wasn\u2019t even about football\u2019 \u2014 he can do that, too.\u201d\nUCLA did not make either Martin or Kwon available to discuss their recruiting accomplishments despite repeated requests since the start of training camp July 30. But those who have interacted with the assistants had plenty to say about the root of their success.\nJustin Lewis, a cornerback from Rancho Cucamonga High, credited Martin\u2019s relentlessness.\n\u201cHe was on me nonstop,\u201d said Lewis, who flipped his commitment from North Carolina to UCLA as soon as the Bruins offered him a scholarship, \u201cso it was pretty hard to say no to him with all the things he was telling me with what he was letting me know and how he was telling me they would be able to use me.\u201d\nTransfers and high school recruits alike have also pointed to the family atmosphere cultivated by Foster, who hosted prospects at his home over five weekends in May and June. After sinking a jumper from well beyond the three-point arc on the basketball goal in his yard, Foster took a victory lap around his pool with one finger held aloft as part of a sequence that led to the commitment of high school defensive lineman Yahya Gaad.\n\u201cThey told me if I hit this jumper, I\u2019m gonna get a commit,\u201d said Foster, careful not to mention any unsigned recruits by name. \u201cWent up there, hit the \u2018J\u2019 and he committed.\u201d\nFor the Bruins to have the breakthrough they\u2019re seeking, here are 10 players who must step up for UCLA to succeed in 2025.\nSome might point out that UCLA\u2019s 2026 high school class ranks only seventh in the Big Ten \u2014 behind top-ranked USC, Oregon, Ohio State, Michigan, Penn State and Washington, according to 247Sports.com \u2014 but Biggins said the Bruins\u2019 talent haul is good enough to help them compete with their conference brethren.\n\u201cThe teams with the most talent win the most games and that\u2019s always been proven,\u201d Biggins said. \u201cNow, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t win if you have the seventh-ranked recruiting class because it still comes down to coaching and development, and that\u2019s always going to be a huge factor. So you want to have guys that when you put them on the same field, it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re playing different sports.\n\u201cI think a couple of years ago, you looked at the sideline and you looked at them and other schools and you\u2019re going, OK, this is like the JV going against the varsity. So I think if you bring in comparable talent, which UCLA is, then you\u2019ve got a chance to win; now it\u2019s scheme and coaching and development.\u201d\nAfter years of seemingly jogging in place, the Bruins could be in the running for something special thanks in large part to the assistants who ran their own race."

      "text": "Shannon Sharpe under fire for \u2018invalidating\u2019 Amanda Seales\u2019 experiences with autism, racism\n- Share via\nIn a three-hour interview on the latest episode of Shannon Sharpe\u2019s podcast \u201cClub Shay Shay,\u201d the former NFL star interviewed actor and comedian Amanda Seales about everything from her recent autism diagnosis to her rumored feud with Issa Rae.\nMany have criticized Sharpe since the episode was released on Wednesday, saying the host seemed to misunderstand Seales\u2019 perspective or misinterpret her comments on several topics she brought up. The conversation grew tense throughout, with Sharpe apologizing to the actor at one point for coming off as \u201ccombative.\u201d\nSeales has been focused on her passion projects, including her clothing line and production company, during the pandemic.\nSeales, 42, said that she had recently been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and noted that Black women often go undiagnosed because of a lack of research on Black women and girls who are on the spectrum. She said she has often felt misunderstood both by people she knows and by strangers because of her neurodivergence.\n\u201cYou get people saying things like, \u2018You are difficult, you are mean, you are nasty,\u2019 and you know you are none of these things,\u201d she said.\nSeales continued to explain her diagnosis and how it manifests for her, whether that\u2019s in her need to doodle when she\u2019s focused or in her tone of voice, which is often interpreted as harsh, but Sharpe did not seem to understand.\n\u201cJust because you have a special gift, that doesn\u2019t mean that you have a spectrum,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you feel just because your brain functions differently that that\u2019s what caused it or there\u2019s a clinical diagnosis?\u201d\nMo\u2019Nique has reignited her yearslong, mostly one-sided feud with Oprah Winfrey in a confessional episode of Shannon Sharpe\u2019s podcast \u2018Club Shay Shay.\u2019\nSeales wrote that she felt Sharpe was \u201cinterrogating\u201d her about her diagnosis in an Instagram post on Friday, adding that he had \u201cabsolutely zero love\u201d for her as he \u201cpressured\u201d her into answering questions.\nAnother part of the conversation that sparked backlash was when Seales recounted an early experience she had with racism when she was a child, working as a dancer for a Christmas show at Walt Disney World. Acknowledging that the two had already disagreed in the interview, Seales prefaced her comments by saying, \u201cEven though you\u2019re gonna probably have an issue with this, they were f\u2014 racist.\u201d\nThe \u201cInsecure\u201d star then described how she was the only Black child out of 12 dancers and was bullied by the other children, who called her by a racial slur and said she was selected only because she was Black.\n\u201cDoes that suffice as racist to you, or would you want to call it something else? Is that just kids being mean?,\u201d she asked.\nKevin Hart, one of the many stars Katt Williams name-checked in his \u2018Club Shay Shay\u2019 interview, addressed the sit-down. So did Tiffany Haddish and Ludacris.\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019re kids,\u201d Sharpe said, then asked if she was a \u201cmodel citizen\u201d as a child. Seales audibly sighed in response, and Sharpe later said that children repeat what they\u2019re hearing from their parents and their environment and don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying is wrong.\nThe heated conversation sparked conversations online about Sharpe\u2019s interviewing tactics, with one fan writing on X (formerly Twitter) that he needs to \u201cdo better with not invalidating others\u2019 experiences with his own.\u201d\nSeales also addressed her relationship with former collaborator Rae, the creator and star of \u201cInsecure,\u201d which had been rumored to be fragmented near the show\u2019s end in 2021. She said she had never talked about their relationship publicly because Rae\u2019s role in Hollywood is \u201cso important.\u201d\nAfter Sharpe said he has heard that Rae\u2019s sets are \u201cempowering,\u201d Seales said she disagreed.\nGillis, hired and fired by \u2018SNL\u2019 in 2019 for racist, sexist and homophobic remarks, excels at demonstrating how unfunny a slur can be.\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t empowering to me,\u201d she said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t feel like I deserved to be protected. I\u2019m only giving a portion of the situation, but that was my experience, and nonetheless, I have still always protected her because I felt like it was my responsibility to do so, but it is not.\u201d\nSince the podcast was released, Seales said in an Instagram video that she was surprised to see the support she got from listeners who lauded her for candor and for speaking about her autism diagnosis.\n\u201cI\u2019m so used to being vilified and misunderstood that to see so many folks finally hearing me has been cathartic,\u201d she wrote."

      "text": "- Share via\nLongtime sports talk show host Skip Bayless made repeated unwanted sexual advances toward a hairstylist working for Fox Sports, including offering the woman $1.5 million to have sex with him, a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court alleges.\nThe 42-page lawsuit also alleges that \u201cfor over a decade at Fox, [the hairstylist] was forced to endure a misogynistic, racist, and ableist workplace where executives and talent were allowed to physically and verbally abuse workers with impunity.\u201d\nAttorneys for Noushin Faraji are seeking unspecified damages from Bayless, Fox Sports and its parent company, Fox Corp. Faraji alleges that when she and others reported the misconduct, \u201cFox retaliated against them while the perpetrators and those who protected them were ... promoted. This case thus represents yet another in a long line of cases chronicling the toxic culture at Fox, marked by bad faith promises and repeated failures to address a poisonous and entrenched patriarchy.\u201d\nBayless, 73, worked for Fox Sports from 2016 until 2024, when his show \u201cUndisputed\u201d was canceled after a dip in ratings coincided with the departure of his co-host, former NFL star Shannon Sharpe. Bayless came to Fox from ESPN, where he first appeared on \u201cCold Pizza\u201d in 2004 and eventually hosted \u201cFirst Take\u201d alongside Stephen A. Smith.\nFaraji worked at the Fox studios in L.A. from 2012 until she was fired in 2024 for what the lawsuit says were \u201cfabricated\u201d reasons. In addition to Bayless, the lawsuit names as defendants Fox Sports executive vice president Charlie Dixon and Fox host Joy Taylor.\nThe three sports talk voices, who all once worked at Fox Sports, discuss a hairstylist\u2019s lawsuit against Skip Bayless, Joy Taylor and Charlie Dixon.\nThe lawsuit alleges that Dixon made an unwanted pass at Faraji during a birthday party for Taylor at a Hollywood restaurant in 2017. Faraji told Taylor about the episode, but Taylor responded by saying, \u201cget over it,\u201d pointing out that \u201cshe herself only had her job because of Mr. Dixon and that Ms. Faraji only had her job because Ms. Taylor requested her\u201d and \u201cshe warned that Mr. Dixon could take both away,\u201d according to the lawsuit, which also details at length an alleged ongoing affair between Taylor and Dixon as well as a romantic relationship between Taylor and another co-host, Emmanuel Acho.\nAt one point, Bayless requested that Faraji give him a haircut once a week in the makeup room. \u201cSoon after the weekly haircuts started, Mr. Bayless began finding excuses to touch Ms. Faraji,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cHe would give her lingering hugs after each haircut, putting his body against her own, pressing against her breasts. He then began to kiss her on her cheeks. Ms. Faraji was uncomfortable by the physical contact and would make excuses to leave right after the haircuts.\u201d\nIn July 2021, the lawsuit states, Faraji explained to Bayless that she was undergoing biopsies to determine whether she had cancer. \u201cMr. Bayless then grabbed her hands, began kissing them, and offered her $1.5 million to have sex,\u201d according to the lawsuit. \u201cApproximately one week later, Mr. Bayless made another advance at Ms. Faraji. Ms. Faraji responded: \u2018Skip, stop, you have a wife.\u2019\u201d\nBayless, who hosts his own podcast, \u201cThe Skip Bayless Show,\u201d on YouTube, married media relations expert Ernestine Sclafani in 2016. Sclafani co-wrote a book with Bayless, published in 2019: \u201cBalls: How to Keep Your Relationship Alive When You Live With a Sports-Obsessed Guy.\u201d\nThe lawsuit also brings forth class action allegations on behalf of \u201call nonexempt hourly individuals who worked for Fox in California during the period commencing four years prior to the filing of this Complaint.\u201d Allegations include nonpayment for all hours worked, nonpayment of overtime, not being reimbursed for business expenses and not being paid severance.\nThe star of \u201cFirst Take\u201d has been taking on issues beyond sports through his podcast and on cable news networks, some of which have offered contributor roles, he says.\nA Fox spokesperson said of the lawsuit, \u201cWe take these allegations seriously and have no further comment at this time given this pending litigation.\u201d An email to Bayless\u2019 representative did not get a response Monday.\nTaylor hosted Monday\u2019s \u201cSpeak\u201d show on FS1, but she and her colleagues \u2014 Keyshawn Johnson, Paul Pierce and Michael Irvin \u2014 didn\u2019t discuss the lawsuit during the two-hour episode.\nSharpe did respond, answering a fan question during his and Chad \u201cOchocinco\u201d Johnson\u2019s \u201cNightcap\u201d podcast about \u201cthe elephant in the room.\u201d\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t got nothing to do with me,\u201d Sharpe said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t. What do y\u2019all want me to say? That ain\u2019t got nothing to do with me. So, there\u2019s nothing to address. I don\u2019t know why everybody keep \u2014 if you notice, everybody\u2019s posting it, they got me.\n\u201cIn those 42 pages, it doesn\u2019t mention that Shannon Sharpe did anything. But y\u2019all want to get clicks, so y\u2019all mention me.\u201d\nShaquille O\u2019Neal dropped a diss track about Shannon Sharpe as part of the beef between the two star athletes-turned-broadcasters that started with a Nikola Jokic interview."

      "text": "Rocky, and painful, outing for Shohei Ohtani as Dodgers lose to Colorado\n- Share via\nDENVER \u2014 The Dodgers lost a game Wednesday. But it could have been worse.\nThey could have lost Shohei Ohtani.\nThe final score was 8-3 in favor of the Colorado Rockies, although the game was far more one-sided than that. And the result, combined with San Diego\u2019s win over the Giants, cut the Dodgers\u2019 lead in the National League West to just a game.\nYet the word the team used most often to describe the night was lucky because two hours after Ohtani took a line drive off his right leg, the reigning National League MVP said he had dodged serious injury when the ball missed his knee and struck him in the thigh.\n\u201cI think we avoided the worst-case scenario,\u201d he said through an interpreter. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to focus on the treatment.\u201d\n\u201cIt was in the thigh, fortunately, and not off the knee,\u201d added manager Dave Roberts. \u201cBut it got him square.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how it comes out. But I\u2019m hopeful, confident.\u201d\nOhtani was struggling through his worst pitching performance in nearly five years, one that would see him give up a season-high five runs and a career-high nine hits, when Colorado\u2019s Orlando Arcia added injury to insult by lining a two-strike shot back up the middle.\nThe ball came off the bat at 93 miles per hour and struck the pitcher just above the right knee before caroming across the first-base line for an RBI single. Ohtani winced in pain and took a practice throw from the mound before being allowed to continue.\nOf the 83 pitches Edgardo Henriquez has thrown this season entering Wednesday\u2019s game, 28 have topped 101 miles per hour, including one that hit 103.3 mph last Saturday.\nHe limped off the mound three batters later with the Dodgers trailing 5-0 and after drawing a walk as the designated hitter in the top of the fifth, Roberts pulled him from the game.\n\u201cI took him out a little bit because of the score [and] because it was getting stiff and there was some swelling there,\u201d the manager said. \u201cI felt as the game was going to go on, it was going to stiffen.\u201d\nWith the Dodgers in the midst of a stretch that will see them play a season-high 19 games without a break, Roberts had already planned to give Ohtani a day off Thursday before the opener of a three-game series Friday in San Diego. That plan, obviously, won\u2019t change.\n\u201cRight now it feels pretty good,\u201d Ohtani said. \u201cI\u2019m going to do everything in my ability to make sure that it doesn\u2019t affect me moving forward.\u201d\nIf Ohtani\u2019s health was the Dodgers\u2019 primary concern Wednesday, worries over his last two pitching performances \u2014 in which he gave up nine runs and 14 hits in 8 1/3 innings, nearly doubling his season ERA from 2.37 to 4.61 \u2014 probably aren\u2019t far behind.\nThe game against Colorado, his first regular-season start at Coors Field, was his 10th start as a Dodger and it didn\u2019t go well from the start, with the weak-hitting Rockies bunching three hits to score two runs in the second.\nColorado, which finished with 16 hits, made it 5-0 in the fourth, with the first five batters reaching base, the last of those coming on Arcia\u2019s line drive.\n\u201cI put the team in a bad spot,\u201d Ohtani said. \u201cIt was just a very regrettable outing that I wish I could have done better.\n\u201cThe ball doesn\u2019t move quite as much as it does in normal sea level, but that\u2019s not an excuse.\u201d\nThe best center fielders in Dodgers history comes down to three names: Duke Snider, Willie Davis and Pete Reiser. Who did the fans choose?\nSpeaking of not making excuses, Roberts promised earlier in the week that the Dodgers would not experience a letdown against the last-place Rockies even through the four-game series comes between six crucial games with the Padres. Now the Dodgers need a win Thursday to earn a split and guarantee they\u2019ll land in San Diego this weekend with the division lead.\n\u201cYou know, the results are the results. The performance is the performance,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI\u2019d like to think it\u2019s not a letdown, but yeah, I don\u2019t know.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do to change it. It certainly leaves a sour taste in your mouth. But we\u2019ve got to win tomorrow.\u201d\nEtc ...\nUtility player Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez made a rehab appearance as the designated hitter for triple-A Oklahoma City on Wednesday, going two for three with a double and an RBI before leaving for a pinch-hitter in the seventh. Hern\u00e1ndez has been on the injured list since July 7 with left elbow inflammation, but he could return to the Dodgers early next week. ... Relievers Kirby Yates and Tanner Scott both threw hitless innings in rehab appearances for Oklahoma City on Tuesday and could rejoin the team in San Diego this weekend. ... Before Wednesday\u2019s game, the Dodgers recalled right-hander Paul Gervase from triple A and optioned right-hander Alexis Diaz. Gervase, 25, acquired from Tampa Bay at the trade deadline, appeared in five games with the Rays this season, striking out six batters in 6 1/3 innings. He made his Dodgers debut against the Rockies, giving up a run and two hits in two innings."
