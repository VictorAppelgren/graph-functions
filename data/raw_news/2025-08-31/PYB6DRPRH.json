  "content": "KENT, Ohio -- Deepan Wagle came to the United States from Nepal to study mechatronics engineering. While the prospect of a quality education encouraged him to come to this country, the early and anticipated impacts of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term are pushing him to leave.\n\nWagle said that what worries him most is witnessing what he sees as a complete consolidation of Trump\u2019s power \u2013 from a Republican majority of Congress to a Supreme Court shaped by his appointments. Seeing few options to fight back against Trump\u2019s policies, Wagle said he\u2019ll be looking to Europe after he graduates in 2027.\n\nCleveland.com | The Plain Dealer talked to students as classes commenced at Ohio\u2019s universities. For incoming freshman, Donald trump will be the commander in chief for almost their entire college careers.\n\nThey worried over where the country is headed under Trump, state policies that could affect teaching in their classes, the cost of their schooling and what that all might mean for their education and future careers.\n\nWagle, a sophomore at Kent State University, has experienced life as a student under two presidents.\n\n\u201cI feel like I came to the U.S. just as its downfall has begun,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump is dramatically reshaping higher education, with executive orders attempting to end diversity, equity and inclusion on campuses; in research at universities; investigations for ; legislation that provides less money for some federal student loans; and an attempt, which thus far has failed , of thousands of international students.\n\nGen Z voters, like the country at large, were divided in last year\u2019s presidential election, with about half saying they voted for Trump and half saying they voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris, said Gabriel Rubin, a professor at Montclair State University in New Jersey about their political views.\n\nThis is more conservative than previous generations when they were young. However, like all generations, the views of young people evolve over time.\n\n\u201cI think that they\u2019re going to shift,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re highly, highly influenced by social media and by the news that they see.\u201d\n\nStudents willing to talk to cleveland.com expressed concerns about Trump. Rubin, who has talked to Gen Z voters in the Northeast, said those who are conservative often are cautious about admitting they voted for the president.\n\nIn his experience, they often asked to be interviewed anonymously for fear of backlash, Rubin said\n\nOn the Oval at OSU, Zen Bowers and Cadence Linn, sophomores each majoring in ecological engineering, remember in February when to comply with Trump\u2019s executive orders and in anticipation of state Senate Bill 1 passing, which banned DEI in public colleges.\n\nOSU closed the Office of Diversity and Inclusion and the Center for Belonging and Social Change. The Office of Institutional Equity was renamed the Office of Civil Rights Compliance to more accurately reflect its work. Some of the programs were transferred to Academic Affairs or Student Life, but were modified to comply with Trump administration demands.\n\n\u201cAll the safe spaces created for people of color are now being more inclusive to people who are not as oppressed, like white students and men,\u201d Bowers said.\n\nLinn said students were notified of the DEI closures , just a day before they closed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit scary to me,\u201d Linn said. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be so much political control over education. The whole thing about education is that it\u2019s not supposed to be touched.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Trump\u2019s policies curtailing DEI and limiting protesting on the grounds of keeping campuses safe against antisemitism, Ohio public colleges have which also prohibits DEI on campus. SB 1 is forcing dozens of changes in how professors address students who have unconventional ideas, under the auspices of fostering intellectual diversity, prohibits universities from taking positions on \u201ccontroversial topics,\u201d and potentially firing tenured professors if they do \u201cnot meet performance expectations\u201d in post-tenure reviews the bill requires.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t experienced anything directly, especially since I present as a straight white guy,\u201d said OSU freshman Jaxon Stevens. \u201cI am bi, though. That kind of puts a little bit of hazard in the back of my mind.\u201d\n\nStevens thought about leaving Ohio to get away from SB 1.\n\n\u201cDue to money in general, I decided to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was something that was in the back of my mind a little bit and I did apply to a couple out of state. But I decided in the end, I think I can deal with people being idiots for it being a couple thousand dollars cheaper.\u201d\n\n\u2018Get out of our country\u2019\n\nWhile some students\u2019 criticisms of Trump centered on certain policy points, others were more sweeping. Asked his thoughts on the president, Kent State freshman Jonah Axelrod\u2019s appraisals ran the gamut.\n\n\u201cYeah, he sucks. Get out of our country,\u201d Axelrod said of the current president.\n\n\u201cBad foreign policy. Bad domestic policy. He\u2019s not fair to his own people. He dumps money in the White House when he should be dumping it, you know, into like cancer research for kids, meals for kids. He\u2019s a selfish, greedy, pig.\u201d\n\nAxelrod is studying to be a commercial pilot in Kent\u2019s professional pilot program, which combines Federal Aviation Administration approved coursework with training university-owned integrated flight simulators. Trump\u2019s mission to shrink the federal workforce has touched nearly every agency, including the FAA. Axelrod said he has been keeping tabs of how the federal budget cuts have altered his future industry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been impacted sometimes because I fly out of a New York-area airport. New York has been affected by it. You know, all the ATC [Air Traffic Control] outages. There have been times where you\u2019ve had less controllers at my airport.\u201d\n\nFreshman Kelly Hauck, from Long Island, N.Y. was looking for a large college with a football program near a city. OSU checked all the boxes, she said.\n\nShe attends OSU on a , which covers her tuition. Hauck received the scholarship because of her grades, as well as an essay in which she described her desire as a woman to study industrial engineering. The scholarship\u2019s eligibility criteria that had to be modified due to the state\u2019s DEI ban, although OSU kept her award, she said.\n\nLast winter, as she was preparing to graduate high school and head to Columbus, family members interested in politics and the news learned about SB 1.\n\nTo Hauck, the worst part of SB 1 is the provision banning the university from taking positions on controversial topics, which the bill includes in its definition \u201cissues such as climate policies, electoral politics, foreign policy, diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, immigration policy, marriage, or abortion.\u201d\n\nSB 1\u2019s sponsor, state Sen. Jerry Cirino, has said that such topics can be discussed, it\u2019s just that schools can\u2019t take positions on them.\n\nSome of the controversial topics in SB 1 are only controversial to the legislature. For instance, two-thirds of Ohio voters believe human activity is at least partially responsible for climate change, . constitutional amendment passed with 58% of the vote.\n\nHauck noticed that students and faculty at OSU protested against the bill at the legislature. Recognizing that Columbus is a blue city, she went ahead with the move.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little worried for everything but I\u2019m trying to stay positive and not consume too much media because it does give me a little anxiety.\u201d\n\nUnder the \u201cOne Big, Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d approved by Congress and signed by Trump, the Direct PLUS loans that allow graduate students to borrow the costs of their education is going away next year.\n\nwith a program that will cap loans to $20,500 a year with a lifetime grad school limit of $100,000. This will make it difficult for middle-class and low-income students to attend grad programs\u2013 unless they can get generous scholarships or , which can have higher interest rates and are less regulated.\n\nOSU freshman Fouvia Ahmed, a first-generation college student, watched the news as the bill progressed through Congress. She dreams of going to medical school. The new law will make it difficult.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going to get the funds, especially when they passed that bill,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nHannah McCauley, a freshman at Kent State planning to study journalism and history, also expressed concern about the changes to student loans.\n\n\u201cUnder the big, beautiful bill, instead of having six months to start paying things back, we have to start doing so immediately,\u201d McCauley said. \u201cThat might not seem like a lot of time, but still plenty of time that we could be saving up,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite her fears for the future, McCauley is choosing a career to build a brighter future for her generation. She hopes to help combat misinformation that has become increasingly commonplace online.\n\n\u201cYou know the big reason I wanted to be in journalism and history was because the state of everything right now,\u201d McCauley said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much misinformation going on.\u201d",

      "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio -The rate of Ohio kindergarteners entering school fully vaccinated plunged 4.5% in the past five years, Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff said.\nIn the 2019-2020 school year, 89.9% incoming kindergartners met all vaccine requirements.\nIn the 2024-2025 school year, the rate decreased to 85.4%.\n\u201cThat means that thousands fewer incoming kindergarteners are protected from the range of diseases that these vaccines prevent,\u201d Vanderhoff said during a news conference this week.\nStudies show vaccines are safe and effective, but Vanderhoff and Dr. Amy Edwards, medical director of pediatric infection control at UH Rainbow Babies and Children\u2019s Hospital in Cleveland, said that misinformation about vaccines has led parents to decline necessary immunizations for their children.\nThat may include vaccine skepticism expressed by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert Kennedy Jr. When asked about RFK\u2019s effect on the spread of preventable diseases, Vanderhoff, who works for Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, skirted politics.\nRFK Jr. removed members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s vaccine advisory panel and replaced them with hand-picked appointees. The new panel said it intends to scrutinize the childhood vaccine schedule.\n\u201cRight now, there\u2019s a lot of discussions going on that relate to vaccines, and I don\u2019t really want to speculate about anything that right now is just in the realm of conversation,\u201d Vanderhoff said. \u201cI think the message that I would have for people is the list of important routine vaccinations, most of which are given during childhood and adolescence are just a solid list of vaccine, most of which have been around for a long time, all of which have a very strong safety and efficacy track record.\u201d\nEdwards said the American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement recently reinforcing the vaccine schedule.\n\u201cI would just say\u2026 regardless of what comes down from the federal or even state governments, that the American Academy of Pediatrics, of which I am a member and a fellow, stand by the safety and efficacy of all our vaccines,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for the vast, vast, vast majority of children, being vaccinated is the right choice.\u201d\nIf people doubt vaccines\u2019 effectiveness, look to this year\u2019s measles outbreak, Vanderhoff said. Through Aug. 19, there have been 1,375 cases, and 92% were in individuals who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccine status. There were 173 hospitalizations and three deaths.\nIn Ohio, there were 35 measles cases \u2013 33 were unvaccinated and two had an unknown vaccine status. One person was hospitalized, and no one has died, Vanderhoff said.\nMany once-deadly childhood illnesses were eradicated in the U.S., but global travel can reintroduce these diseases, putting unvaccinated individuals at risk, he said.\nStories by Laura Hancock\n- Ohio\u2019s Gen Z college students navigate Trump\u2019s second term, from axing DEI to student loan changes\n- Ohio says child vaccine rates are slipping; Shots a kindergartner needs\n- Some states already pay student teachers up to $20,000 -- Ohio might be next\n- Ohio sued over new voter registration requirements at the BMV: Capitol Letter"

      "text": "What borrowers should know about student loan changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill\nTrump's budget bill overhauls the federal student loan system. Here's what to know\nIf you're a federal student loan borrower or about to become one, your head may be spinning.\nOn July 4, when President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law, he also greenlit a history-making overhaul of the federal student loan system \u2014 one that will affect the lives of many, if not most, of the United States' nearly 43 million student loan borrowers.\nAnd boy is it a lot to unpack, with new, tighter borrowing limits and dramatically reduced repayment options, to name just a few of the sweeping changes.\nIn May, we explained this overhaul, as conceived by House Republicans. Now that a Senate compromise has been signed into law, here's an updated guided tour of the final changes.\nLet's start with the elephant in the room:\nPresident Biden's SAVE plan is ending\nThe most generous repayment plan is the Biden-era Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. But it is so generous, with its low monthly payments and expedited loan forgiveness, that Republicans have so far successfully argued in court that it is too generous. In fact, the nearly 7.7 million borrowers currently enrolled in SAVE have been in legal limbo for months, without interest accruing or required monthly payments.\nThat's about to change.\n\"For all practical purposes, I would say SAVE is just kind of dead at this point, even if it's technically on life support,\" said Preston Cooper at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute (AEI).\nThis month, the U.S. Education Department announced that on Aug. 1, SAVE borrowers will, once again, see their balances grow \u2014 with interest. Because the SAVE plan is still enjoined, though, borrowers won't yet be required to make payments. Still, Cooper said that many borrowers, rather than watch their loans balloon, will likely want to move to a different plan.\nRoxanne Garza, director of higher education policy at the liberal-leaning EdTrust, worries that the relatively last-minute announcement about interest accrual will cause problems for the Education Department, which saw roughly half its staff cut by the Trump administration.\n\"I think what will likely happen now is you will see a rush of people trying to take action that will, again, likely create an even bigger backlog,\" said Garza.\nUnder the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, borrowers in SAVE will have to change plans by July 1, 2028, when SAVE will be officially shut down. If they wait, though they currently can't be required to make payments, they will see their loans explode with interest.\nBut the two new plans that the law creates won't be ready for a year, and the department's own website, meant to help borrowers navigate their repayment options, does not reflect this confusing new landscape, except for a banner that says: \"Loan Simulator will be updated at a later date to reflect recent legislative changes.\"\nBeginning July 1, 2026, new loans will be subject to new borrowing limits\nUndergraduates won't see any changes to their loan limits. But it's a very different story for graduate students and parents.\nFor graduate students, new limits will make it harder for lower- and middle-income borrowers to attend pricier graduate programs. The current grad PLUS loan allows students to borrow up to the cost of their graduate program, but Republicans are shutting it down this time next year.\nAfter that, grad students' borrowing will be capped at $20,500 a year with a lifetime graduate school loan limit of $100,000, a big drop from the previous cap of $138,500.\nHow big a deal will this be? AEI's Cooper has been crunching the numbers and said, \"Just under 20% of master's students borrow above the proposed limits.\"\nBorrowers working toward a professional graduate degree (i.e., medical or law school) will have their borrowing capped at $50,000 a year and their lifetime cap increased from $138,500 to $200,000.\nParents and caregivers who use parent PLUS loans to help students pay for college will also see new loan limits. They will be capped at $20,000 a year and, in aggregate, at $65,000 per child.\nCooper says only one-third of parent PLUS borrowers with dependent children currently take out more than this new annual loan cap.\nThe law also sets a new lifetime limit, for undergrad and graduate loans combined, at $257,500 per person.\nRepayment options for borrowers are changing dramatically\nRepublicans are reducing repayment options for new borrowers from the current seven plans down to two new plans. The new plans are:\n1. The standard plan\nNew borrowers will be assigned a repayment window of between 10 and 25 years, depending on the size of their debt, with equal monthly payments like a home mortgage.\nUnder this plan, borrowers with larger debts would qualify for a longer repayment period:\n- Owe less than $25,000, and repay over 10 years.\n- Owe $25,000 or more but less than $50,000? Repayment expands to 15 years.\n- Owe $50,000 or more but less than $100,000: Repay over 20 years.\n- Anyone owing $100,000 or more would repay over a 25-year period.\n2. The Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP)\nFor borrowers worried they don't earn enough to cover the inflexible monthly payments of the new standard plan, Republicans have also created the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP).\nOn RAP, payments would largely be based on borrowers' total adjusted gross income (AGI).\n- Borrowers earning no more than $10,000 would be asked to pay $10 a month.\n- Earn more than $10,000 but not more than $20,000, and your payment will be based on 1% of AGI.\n- More than $20,000 but not more than $30,000, it would be 2% of AGI and so on up the income scale.\n- Repayment tops out at 10% of AGI for borrowers earning $100,000 a year or more.\nCurrent borrowers will also have access to this new RAP plan, as well as to some older plans.\nRAP is the latest in a long line of income-based repayment plans. How does it compare with previous plans?\nMonthly payments for many middle-income borrowers on RAP will be lower compared with earlier plans, according to multiple experts. But RAP is not as generous as the Biden-era SAVE plan, which, again, is being phased out.\nRAP will require even the lowest-income borrowers to make a minimum monthly payment of $10, ending the $0 option of previous plans and making it more expensive for these borrowers.\nThis new $10 minimum payment wouldn't make a big difference to the government's coffers, said Jason Delisle, who spoke to NPR in May, when he was studying student loan policy at the Urban Institute. Delisle has since been appointed to a position in the Trump administration.\nDelisle said the purpose of RAP's new $10 minimum payment likely stems from \"emerging research that requiring people to make some payment each month is good because it keeps them connected to the loan and makes it less likely that they'll default.\"\nBut some borrower advocates worry that this new minimum payment could have the opposite effect.\nFor the lowest-income borrowers, asking for $120 a year is \"significant,\" EdTrust's Garza told NPR in May. \"I think having that be a required minimum payment will likely push more borrowers into default.\"\nBut RAP also comes with a few new perks that borrowers will likely appreciate.\nRAP will waive any interest that is left after a borrower makes their monthly payment.\nIf their monthly payment is $50 but they owe $75 a month in interest, the government will waive the remaining $25.\nThe result: Borrowers will no longer see their loans grow, which was a common downside to previous income-driven repayment plans.\nBorrowers on RAP will also see their balances go down every month.\nThe government will pitch in up to $50 to make sure lower-income borrowers see their principal balances shrink.\nFor example, a borrower whose monthly payment makes only a $30 dent in their principal would see the government knocking off an extra $20 a month.\nBorrowers whose monthly payments already reduce their principal balance by at least $50 would get no extra help from the government.\n\"It's a form of monthly loan forgiveness,\" Delisle said. \"It's a drip, drip, drip of loan forgiveness, rather than waiting for the big payout at the end of 20 years.\"\nThe loan forgiveness math will change.\nWhile previous plans offered forgiveness after 20 or 25 years, the RAP would extend that to 360 qualifying payments, or 30 years. That's a big difference, said AEI's Cooper.\nBorrowers with typical levels of debt \"and typical incomes for their degree level are almost always gonna pay off well before they hit that 30-year mark,\" Cooper said. \"So if you're going into RAP, I wouldn't be thinking about forgiveness because you're probably gonna pay it off before you hit 30 years.\"\nIn short, the days of what Delisle called \"the big payout\" are over.\nBut wait! Current borrowers have another loan forgiveness option (sort of).\nIn addition to RAP, an older plan known as Income-Based Repayment (IBR) will still be available to borrowers who take out their loans before July 1, 2026.\nPart of the reason IBR remains is that, unlike other income-driven repayment plans, IBR wasn't created by the Education Department. It was created by Congress and is codified in statute.\nHow does IBR work? For borrowers with loans older than July 2014, their payments are capped at 15% of discretionary income. Payments on younger loans are capped at 10%.\nWith the Biden-era SAVE plan being wound down, Delisle said, most lower- and middle-income borrowers would likely have lower monthly payments on the new RAP compared with IBR.\nBut, Delisle said, borrowers with older loans might still want to enroll in IBR if they've been in repayment for close to 20 or 25 years, so they can qualify for loan forgiveness.\nThat's because, on IBR, pre-2014 loans qualify for forgiveness after 25 years. For newer loans, it's just 20 years \u2014 both considerably shorter than RAP's 30-year schedule.\nOne big caveat to all this: The Education Department has temporarily stopped processing all loan forgiveness for borrowers on IBR because of the legal actions surrounding the SAVE plan, according to a statement from Education Department Deputy Press Secretary Ellen Keast.\nKeast said the Biden-era rule explaining SAVE \"provided the authority to count forbearances in IBR toward loan forgiveness\" and, because that rule has been frozen by the courts, the department can't accurately determine loan forgiveness under IBR. \"Discharges will resume as soon as the Department is able to establish the correct payment count,\" Keast said.\nThe department told NPR that any borrowers who make payments after they're eligible for forgiveness will eventually get a refund.\nEdited by Nicole Cohen"

      "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio - Ohio State University announced it was closing two offices devoted to diversity, equity and inclusion work on Friday to comply with executive orders from President Donald Trump and a bill working through the state legislature.\nOSU President Ted Carter announced the decision in a letter to the university community.\n\u201cHere in Ohio, a bill barring DEI is also making its way through the legislature, and the Attorney General of Ohio \u2013 our statutory counsel \u2013 has advised us that his office concurs with the federal government\u2019s position regarding the use of race in educational activities,\u201d Carter wrote in his Thursday letter.\nREAD MORE: Cleveland Clinic loses chief DEI position, pauses some diversity efforts in wake of Trump orders\nParts of Trump\u2019s DEI ban are actually not in effect at this time. Last week, a federal court in Maryland temporarily blocked enforcement of orders that would have required schools to terminate grants and contracts for equity work.\nAnd the General Assembly\u2019s Senate Bill 1 has only passed one chamber.\nREAD MORE: Ohio Senate passes bill targeting liberal \u2018indoctrination\u2019 on college campuses\nNevertheless, Carter, a former superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy, has decided to act. OSU, the state\u2019s largest university with around 65,000 students across all its campuses, is believed to be the first school in Ohio to publicly announce cuts to DEI.\nTrump has signed a handful of executive orders seeking to eliminate diversity and inclusion.\nOne affects the U.S. Department of Education, by requiring it to cut diversity programs and place DEI staff on leave. Another aims to limit funding for \u201cgender ideology\u201d programs and interprets Title IX as not applying to the gender to which transgender students identify. And another intends to end \u201cradical indoctrination\u201d by denying the U.S. is inherently racist or sexist and prefers students to receive a \u201cpatriotic\u201d education.\nIn a recent letter the U.S. Department of Education sent to college officials across the country, none of Trump\u2019s orders were mentioned, but it said funding could be cut if schools continued DEI efforts.\nOSU\u2019s Office of Diversity and Inclusion and the Student Life\u2019s Center for Belonging and Social Change were to close Friday, Carter announced.\nSome of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion\u2019s services will continue, such as scholarships. But in the future they will have modified eligibility criteria, he wrote.\nAll programming and services in the Center for Belonging and Social Change will be discontinued.\nOSU\u2019s Office of Institutional Equity will be renamed the Office of Civil Rights Compliance to more accurately reflect its work, Carter wrote. The office will continue to receive, investigate and resolve reports of discrimination, harassment and sexual misconduct.\nAs a result of the two offices closing, sixteen positions will be eliminated, OSU spokesman Ben Johnson said.\nThe workers will remain OSU employees for about 60 days. If other positions open that they are interested in, school officials will help them transition to those positions, Johnson said.\n\u201cStudent employees will keep their employment,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey may be moved to a different job, but no student will lose their scholarship, their financial aid package or their job on campus.\u201d\nMeantime, students conducted a sit-in at OSU\u2019s Hale Black Culture Center, which is part of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Photos provided by the Ohio Organizing Collaborative, a coalition of social, racial and economic justice groups, showed students creating signs such as, \u201cWe belong,\u201d \u201cStronger together,\u2019 and \u201cHey Carter, there\u2019s nothing complex about censorship.\u201d\nCarter, in his letter, said the soon-to-close offices have performed valuable work for the university community and he understands people will be disappointed.\n\u201cOhio State has always been a place where every member of our community matters, where each of us is seen and heard, and where we all have opportunities to succeed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cProtecting all our students, faculty and staff so that they can all be successful in their time at Ohio State will remain our North Star. We will continue to celebrate the richness of backgrounds and ideas that makes us strong, and to uphold the time-honored value of academic freedom that has long defined the excellence of America\u2019s universities.\u201d\nElsewhere in Ohio, other colleges are also evaluating how to respond to federal guidance after they received a Feb. 14 letter from the U.S. Department of Education that threatening funding cuts for racial equity programs.\nThe letter said the department would give colleges no more than 14 days to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 decision prohibiting racial preferences in admissions policies, which the department argues applies to other university policies beyond admissions.\nEven though the court was ruling on admissions policies, \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s holding applies more broadly,\u201d the letter states. \u201cAt its core, the test is simple: If an educational institution treats a person of one race differently than it treats another person because of that person\u2019s race, the educational institution violates the law. Federal law thus prohibits covered entities from using race in decisions pertaining to admissions, hiring, promotion, compensation, financial aid, scholarships, prizes, administrative support, discipline, housing, graduation ceremonies, and all other aspects of student, academic, and campus life. Put simply, educational institutions may neither separate or segregate students based on race, nor distribute benefits or burdens based on race.\u201d\nCase Western Reserve University President Eric Kaler wrote to the university community on Feb. 18 that the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s interpretation of the Supreme Court \u201cappears to be a gross overreach.\u201d\n\u201cAt the university, we are assessing our processes and programs that are relevant to the letter,\u201d Kaler wrote. \u201cFor example, we have determined that our admissions and financial aid processes align with the letter\u2019s compliance points because of the extensive work done following the 2023 Supreme Court ruling.\u201d\nCase is assessing processes and programs that could pertain to the letter. It has determined that admissions and financial aid comply, because of work Case did immediately after the Supreme Court ruling, he wrote.\nAt the university, we are assessing our processes and programs that are relevant to the letter. For example, we have determined that our admissions and financial aid processes align with the letter\u2019s compliance points because of the extensive work done following the 2023 Supreme Court ruling.\nKaler acknowledged the changes at the federal level are unsettling and is encouraging students counseling if they think they need it.\nBaldwin Wallace University eliminated its chief diversity officer as part of a budget reorganization in October, which had been recommended by an independent audit, said university spokesman Shawn Salamone.\n\u201cHowever, diversity and inclusion is a alive and well at BW,\u201d he said in a Friday email. \u201cBW\u2019s Center for Inclusion (CFI) remains a part of campus life with a fulltime staffer (associate director of cultural programming). None of the funding for CFI programming was reduced.\u201d\nKent State University officials reviewed the U.S. Department of Education letter, known in higher education circles as the \u201cDear Colleague letter,\u201d said Kent State spokeswoman Emily Vincent.\n\u201cBased on the information contained within the Dear Colleague letter, we believe that Kent State University is in compliance,\u201d she said. \u201cAdditionally, as the letter indicates, we await the department\u2019s \u2018Additional legal guidance [which] will follow in due course.\u2019\u201d\nThe University of Akron also believes it\u2019s in compliance with the requirements in the letter, \u201cand has not made further changes as a result of receiving the Dear Colleague Letter,\u201d said spokeswoman Tammy Ewin. \u201cLike other higher education institutions, we will await further guidance and will continue to comply.\u201d\nIn early February, the University of Akron cancelled a forum it had held every Black History Month since 1997. The forum explored topics such as social justice and DEI, but university officials decided it violated Trump\u2019s anti-DEI orders.\nStories by Laura Hancock\n- Ohio\u2019s Gen Z college students navigate Trump\u2019s second term, from axing DEI to student loan changes\n- Ohio says child vaccine rates are slipping; Shots a kindergartner needs\n- Ohio kindergarten vaccination rates drop 4.5% in five years, health officials warn\n- Some states already pay student teachers up to $20,000 -- Ohio might be next\nLaura Hancock covers state government and politics for The Plain Dealer and cleveland.com."

      "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio -Ohio law requires students to be protected against 10 serious diseases before entering school, but vaccination rates among kindergartners have decreased by 4.5%.\nState law requires children enrolling in school to be immunized against the following diseases:\n-Diphtheria\n-Hepatitis B\n-Measles\n-Meningococcal disease\n-Mumps\n-Pertussis (whooping cough)\n-Polio\n-Rubella\n-Tetanus\n-Varicella (chickenpox)\nDespite these long-standing requirements intended to keep classrooms safe, state health officials warn that fewer kindergartners arrive fully vaccinated than in years\u2019 past.\nOhio Department of Health Director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff said this week that the percentage of kindergarteners meeting all vaccine requirements has fallen 4.5% over the last five years.\nIn the 2019\u20132020 school year, roughly 89.9% of students were fully vaccinated. By 2024\u20132025, that figure had dropped to 85.4%.\n\u201cThat means thousands fewer incoming kindergarteners are protected from the range of diseases that these vaccines prevent,\u201d Vanderhoff said.\nPublic health experts say widespread misinformation has fueled parental hesitancy, even as extensive research confirms vaccines are safe and effective.\nDr. Amy Edwards, pediatric infection control director at UH Rainbow Babies and Children\u2019s Hospital in Cleveland, said misleading claims online and in public discourse have led some families to forgo recommended shots.\nAmong the misinformation is that vaccines aren\u2019t tested for safety after they\u2019ve entered the market, she said.\nStories by Laura Hancock\n- Ohio\u2019s Gen Z college students navigate Trump\u2019s second term, from axing DEI to student loan changes\n- Ohio kindergarten vaccination rates drop 4.5% in five years, health officials warn\n- Some states already pay student teachers up to $20,000 -- Ohio might be next\n- Ohio sued over new voter registration requirements at the BMV: Capitol Letter\nVaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration are tested for safety and efficacy in three different phases during clinical trials. After a vaccine has been approved for use, several different monitoring services track vaccine safety events in the U.S. and throughout the world, Edwards said.\nThe climate has shifted at the federal level, where U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently dismissed members of the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with his own appointees. The new panel plans to reexamine the nation\u2019s childhood vaccine schedule, sparking concern among pediatricians.\nAsked about Kennedy\u2019s influence, Vanderhoff avoided politics.\n\u201cI think the message that I would have for people is the list of important routine vaccinations, most of which are given during childhood and adolescence are just a solid list of vaccines, most of which have been around for a long time, all of which have a very strong safety and efficacy track record.\u201d\nEdwards noted that the American Academy of Pediatrics continues to back the existing vaccine schedule, regardless of political changes.\n\u201cFor the vast, vast, vast majority of children, being vaccinated is the right choice,\u201d she said.\nThe real-world consequences of declining vaccination are already evident.\nIn 2025, the United States reported 1,375 measles cases as of Aug. 19. About 92% of those infected were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, according to Vanderhoff. The outbreak has led to 173 hospitalizations and three deaths nationwide.\nOhio logged 35 measles cases during that time. Of those, 33 patients had no vaccinations and two had unknown status; one person was hospitalized and no one died.\nExperts say such outbreaks highlight what\u2019s at stake. Though many dangerous childhood illnesses were once eliminated in the U.S., international travel continues to reintroduce them \u2014 making vaccine coverage critical to protecting children, families, and communities.\nThis story was drafted with the assistance of AI."

An attorney for Cynderila Patrick, a Nigerian citizen now living in Maryland, said Patrick\u2019s visa was likely revoked over a 2024 fourth-degree misdemeanor charge that prosecutors ultimately dropped.\nA federal judge recently granted Ohio State University doctoral student Prasanna Oruganti a temporary order reinstating her student visa, the Columbus Dispatch reported. And Jiarong Ouyang, a PhD statistics student at the University of Cincinnati, recently sued over his revocation, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer.\nAt least 15 Ohio colleges affected\nInside Higher Ed, a publication that is tracking revocations mostly through local media coverage, has found that at least 1,730 international students have had visas revoked nationally.\nCombining Inside Higher Ed\u2019s counts with Cleveland.com/The Plain Dealer\u2019s tracking shows that at least 15 Ohio colleges have been affected.\nThe following is the breakdown of international students whose visas have been revoked across Ohio:\n-Youngstown State University: 14\n-Ohio State University: 12\n-Kent State University: 10\n-Case Western Reserve University: 4\n-Walsh University: 4\n-University of Akron: 3\n-University of Findlay: 3\n-Cuyahoga Community College: 3\n-Sinclair College: 3\n-Cleveland State University: At least 1\n-Xavier University: At least 1\n-Bowling Green State University: 1\n-Columbus State Community College: 1\n-University of Toledo: \u201cA small number\u201d\n-University of Cincinnati: \u201cA small number\u201d\nAs with the other schools in Ohio, the community colleges said they didn\u2019t know the specifics about why the students\u2019 visas were terminated.\nOhio colleges are learning about the revocations only after checking the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, a federal database for international student visas.\nPhD students\nOruganti, the OSU student, is from India.

She said the only record she could have is a June 2020 guilty plea for a minor traffic misdemeanor in Missouri. She hit some decorative bricks with her car, pleaded guilty to a defective equipment charge, and paid a $300 fine.\n\u201cOpposing the (temporary order), Defendants (the federal government) at the hearing alluded to a vague administrative process that Plaintiff could have pursued to restore her (visa) record, including by contacting ICE directly. But in this Court\u2019s view, that would amount to letting the proverbial fox guard the chicken house. The record is replete with instances of international students subject to visa revocations or\u2026 terminations being arrested and detained by ICE without warning,\u201d Marbley said in granting the order.\nThe University of Cincinnati PhD student Jiarong Ouyang\u2019s case is in federal court in San Francisco. His case involves himself and two other international students from China who are suing DHS, hoping a judge will restore their visas, according to the Enquirer.\nOuyang argues he has no criminal record.

Sean Brennan calls \u201ca longstanding, unfortunate tradition\u201d of unpaid student teaching.\nStudent teachers in Ohio currently work full time in schools without compensation while simultaneously paying college tuition and covering living expenses, said Brennan, a Parma Democrat and retired teacher who is sponsoring the bill with Republican lawmakers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating. It was frustrating for me when I was going through student teaching,\u201d Brennan said.\nThe lack of pay creates barriers for aspiring educators, particularly those from low-income backgrounds and underrepresented communities, he said.\nUnder HB 205, local school districts and charter schools could choose to pay student teachers at least Ohio\u2019s minimum wage of $10.45 per hour and include them in health insurance plans. The Ohio Department of Education and Workforce would be permitted to provide cost-of-living stipends and test fee waivers or reimbursements based on financial need.\n\u201cThe bill is not mandatory; it\u2019s permissive,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to start somewhere. And my hope is that slowly over time, it\u2019ll become best practice that we compensate our student teachers.\u201d\nWhile no state law currently bans compensation for student teachers, Brennan believes explicit legislation would eliminate confusion about the legality of such payments.\nThe bill includes additional provisions to address Ohio\u2019s teacher shortage. It would require the Department of Education and Workforce to develop a survey for local schools describing their vacancies and educators teaching subjects they\u2019re not licensed to teach, with responses submitted to the General Assembly. Federal research showed that about one in 20 Ohio teachers were improperly certified for their subject or grade level last year.\nHB 205 would also require the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services to add teachers to its online list of in-demand jobs.\nJeff Wensing, president of the Ohio Education Association, supports the bill. He said unpaid student teaching can deter people from entering education, including older individuals considering teaching as a second career.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any other profession where you go through an apprentice program and you\u2019re not compensated, which is what student teaching is,\u201d Wensing said.\nAaron Churchill, Ohio research director for the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank and charter school sponsor, called the bill worthy of discussion as the teacher pipeline needs good candidates.\n\u201cTrying to figure out how to get student teachers covered is a good idea,\u201d Churchill said. \u201cA lot of them put in a lot of work. It\u2019s an important part of teacher training. It\u2019s super important for teachers to get classroom experience.\u201d\nChurchill suggested the state should also consider waiving university tuition during student teaching periods.\nAI was used in the drafting of this story."

      "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio voters passed a state constitutional amendment Tuesday guaranteeing abortion rights and became the seventh state to side with reproductive rights since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\nThe amendment protects individuals\u2019 decisions about abortion, pregnancy, contraception, miscarriage care and fertility treatment until fetal viability, around 22 to 24 weeks. Then the General Assembly would be allowed to regulate reproductive decisions. But women would still be allowed to get an abortion after viability if in the professional judgement of her physician it\u2019s needed to protect her life or health.\nThe Associated Press called the race for the \u201cyes\u201d side just after 9 p.m. Tuesday. As of 10:45 p.m., Issue 1 was passing with about 55.6% of the vote and 84% of precincts reporting results.\nThe amendment will take effect 30 days after the election, but its practical effects could take years to ripple through the dozens of Ohio laws regulating abortion. Ultimately, courts will decide which laws conflict with the new language in the state constitution.\nNancy Kramer, co-chair of Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, the campaign backing the amendment, said Ohioans of all political stripes don\u2019t want the government making health care decisions for them. She spoke while the election results looked promising for the \u201cyes\u201d campaign but before it had won.\n\u201cWhen the Supreme Court delivered the Dobbs decision (overturning Roe v. Wade) they said they were sending the issue back to the states,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cToday, the state of Ohio will have spoken.\u201d\nMore Ohio abortion stories\n- What should be done with frozen embryos if a couple who made them divorces?

The campaigns have collectively spent at least $38 million, plus more in untraceable dark money, paying for campaign ads and materials.\nRepublican leaders in the General Assembly scheduled an $18 million special election in August intended to thwart the abortion rights amendment by requiring all future constitutional amendments pass with a supermajority at the ballot box. That was defeated and Ohio\u2019s abortion rights amendment only needed to pass with 50% plus one vote, a simple majority.\nSince the amendment allows abortion until viability, Ohio\u2019s six week \u201cheartbeat\u201d abortion ban will likely be invalidated. The law was in effect for 82 days last summer until a judge put it on an indefinite hold while its overall constitutionality is litigated in his courtroom.\nAt an anti-Issue 2 campaign event Tuesday night, Protect Women Ohio leaders were reluctant to share next steps. Aaron Baer, a prominent socially conservative activist who was one of the group\u2019s top leaders, said he\u2019s still digesting the results.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to mourn the loss of 30,000 babies a year, and we\u2019re going to pick back up and keep fighting this stuff like we have for 50 years,\u201d Baer said.\nRepublican legislative leaders were more explicit in what they planned to do next.\n\u201cLife is worth fighting for,\u201d said Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman, a Lima Republican, who supported the special election and has steered anti-abortion legislation through his chamber. \u201cAs a grandparent of eight, the life of a baby is always worth the fight. The national abortion industry funded by wealthy out-of-state special interests spent millions to pass this radical language that goes far past abortion on demand. This isn\u2019t the end. It is really just the beginning of a revolving door of ballot campaigns to repeal or replace Issue 1.\u201d\nBut the legislature\u2019s special election \u2013 combined with ballot language written by a Republican-controlled state board led by Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose that included terms such as \u201cunborn child\u201d \u2013 has Ohioans sick of politics as usual, said J. Bennett \u201cBen\u201d Guess, director of the ACLU of Ohio, which helped pass the amendment.\nGuess encouraged the several hundred supporters who attended the \u201cyes\u201d election results watch party to continue to work toward reform in state government. The next potential amendment proposal in 2024 would attempt, again, to end gerrymandering of state legislative districts. That way \u201cwe finally rid this state of its corrupt, unresponsive and unrepresentative, grotesquely gerrymandered politicians.\u201d\nOther abortion bans \u2013 the legislature has passed three dozen of them since the 1980s \u2013 will likely be decided by the courts, from requiring a 24-hour waiting period to whether abortion clinics need to have transfer agreements with private hospitals inside the state and within 30 miles of the clinic.\nCourts will decide the constitutionality of each ban, according to the amendment, by determining whether each is the least restrictive means to impose a ban, and whether the restriction advances a woman\u2019s \u201chealth in accordance with widely accepted and evidence-based standards of care.\u201d\nThe results were a broadside against Republican leaders who have advanced increasingly more restrictive abortion measures and a victory for progressives who have long held that their policies are popular among Ohioans.\nREAD MORE: Ohio abortion amendment\nPolling has generally shown that about 58% of Ohioans support abortion rights on some level. While the campaign against Issue 1 \u2013 which included Gov. Mike DeWine \u2013 sought to paint the proposed amendment as too extreme, Ohioans apparently disagreed.\nAfter some initial conflict among abortion rights organizations over whether to pursue the amendment in 2023 or 2024, the groups united under national spotlight to score the signature electoral victory of the year.\nOhio was the latest domino to fall against anti-abortion forces since realizing their long-held goal of toppling Roe v. Wade. The decision in June 2022 returned the question of abortion regulation to the states, where abortion-rights backers have prevailed now on seven straight ballots.\n\u201cWhen abortion is on the ballot, we win,\u201d said Kellie Copeland, executive director of Pro-Choice Ohio, which was one of several organizations backing the amendment. \u201cWe hope this victory builds momentum to our colleagues in Florida and Missouri and all the other states who will be fighting the same fight, and we will be with them, shoulder to shoulder... Ohio is not a red state. We\u2019re purple as hell, baby.\u201d\nA wave of other statewide ballot initiatives related to abortion rights are expected across the country in 2024 at the same time that races for president and both chambers of Congress are to be decided.\n\u201cMake no mistake that today marks a dark day for the Buckeye state. After a long campaign season, Ohioans voted to enshrine murder into our state\u2019s guiding document,\u201d said Lizzie Marbach, an anti-abortion activist who was at odds with the campaign against Issue 1. \u201cMay these results be a lesson to pro-life organizations that refused to address this issue head on. Their cowardice during this pivotal moment should not be forgotten moving forward. The fight, however, is not over. We will continue fighting to establish equal protection under the law for the preborn based on the 14th amendment of the US Constitution.\u201d\nOhio\u2019s amendment drew the national spotlight on Tuesday as the only state in the nation deciding on abortion rights after six other states had done so last year and a handful of others are expected on the ballot in 2024. President Joe Biden called the amendment\u2019s passage a win for democracy and called on Congress to reinstate the Roe standard as a federal law.\n\u201cIn Ohio, voters protected access to reproductive health in their state constitution. Ohioans and voters across the country rejected attempts by MAGA Republican elected officials to impose extreme abortion bans that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy, force women to travel hundreds of miles for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors and nurses for providing the health care that their patients need and that they are trained to provide. This extreme and dangerous agenda is out-of-step with the vast majority of Americans,\u201d Biden said in a statement released Tuesday night.\nLaura Hancock covers state government and politics for The Plain Dealer and cleveland.com.\nAndrew Tobias covers state politics and government for cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer\nSabrina Eaton contributed reporting."

      "text": "The statewide survey underscores a disconnect between Ohio voters and the direction of their elected officials on critical issues.\nA majority of voters in Baldwin Wallace University's new Ohio Pulse Poll say elected officials of all political stripes are falling short in representing their views.\nDespite Ohio's reputation as a politically conservative state, the survey by BW's Community Research Institute (CRI) finds that Ohioans' views on a number of key issues \u2014 from gun control to education \u2014 are far more progressive than their statehouse leadership reflects.\nThe survey of 877 registered voters across Ohio, conducted from September 30 to October 1, highlights frustration with political leadership and a surprising alignment with some policies often seen as progressive, even as Ohio remains labeled a \"red state.\"\nAll elected leaders received negative net ratings when participants were asked whether they were doing an excellent, good, fair or poor job representing their views.\nPresident Joe Biden received the lowest score, at minus 37, but the Republican-dominated state legislature as a whole fared almost as poorly, at minus 34.\n\"Although Ohio's political leadership is leveraging conservative, wedge issues like illegal immigration and transgender rights in political advertising this election cycle, the Ohio electorate is more progressive on many other issues like education, gun restrictions and abortion,\" said Lauren Copeland, director of the CRI.\nWhile inflation (24%) and the economy (18%) were identified as the most pressing issues for Ohio voters, survey results show stark differences between Ohio's voters and the direction of its elected officials on critical issues such as education, gun control, abortion and the public discourse around race and immigration.\nEducation: More than 80% support teaching lessons on the history and impact of race and racism in the U.S., and more than 60% back teaching sexual orientation in middle and high schools. Additionally, a majority of voters oppose parental control over which books are in the school library or the topics that are taught.\nGun Control: Despite Ohio's permissive gun laws, an overwhelming 86% of respondents favor expanded background checks for gun buyers aged 18 to 21, and 75% support raising the minimum age to buy an AR-15-style rifle from 18 to 21. Three-quarters of voters also support red flag laws, which allow the temporary removal of guns from individuals deemed dangerous. A ban on the sale of AR-15-style semi-automatic rifles also enjoys majority support (56%).\nReproductive Rights: 56% of Ohio voters say abortion should generally be permitted with some limitations, which is directly in line with the 56.8% of Ohioans who voted to enshrine reproductive rights in the state constitution last year.\nClimate Change: Two-thirds of Ohio voters believe human activity is at least partially responsible for global climate change.\nThe survey also revealed conservative stances on hot-button issues often highlighted in GOP political ads.\nTransgender rights: Large majorities of Ohio voters reject protections for transgender people. Nearly three-quarters oppose allowing transgender athletes to play on the team that matches their gender identity and object to medical professionals providing minors with medical care for a gender transition. Two-thirds of respondents take issue with transgender individuals using public bathrooms that match their gender identity.\nImmigration: Opinions are more mixed on the issue of immigration, especially when it comes to illegals. Overall, voters are equally divided on whether to require undocumented immigrants to leave the country. Almost half believe illegal immigrants do not contribute to the U.S. economy, and some 58% of Ohioans say immigrants here illegally pose a significant or moderate threat to public safety.\nHowever, on legal immigration, 60% of voters across the political spectrum agree with Governor Mike DeWine's call in a recent editorial for Ohioans to reject harmful rhetoric about legal Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, which \"hurts the city and its people.\"\n\"The response to DeWine's editorial shows that Ohioans are capable of bipartisan consensus on immigration when the message is one of empathy and humanity,\" said Copeland. \"It's a hopeful sign that voters across the board recognize the damage divisive rhetoric can cause and are willing to support a more humane approach.\"\nWith gerrymandering again on the November ballot, 69% of Ohio voters say they \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" oppose the manipulation of electoral boundaries to give one political party an advantage.\nIssue 1 would take the power to draw district lines away from elected politicians and establish a citizen's commission, but the final ballot language states, in part, that it would \"require\" gerrymandering.\n\"It remains to be seen if the level of antipathy toward gerrymandering translates to support for Issue 1 with the controversial wording of the final ballot language,\" said Copeland. \"Rather than reflecting the intent of the amendment to establish a citizen-led independent redistricting process, the language is misleading. Elected politicians in Ohio from both parties have a long history of trying to hold onto the power that gerrymandering confers.\"\nWhile one in ten (22% among liberals) cite \"Threats to democracy\" as an important issue in the upcoming election, voters overwhelmingly have confidence that Ohio can run a fair and accurate election this year.\nVoters are split on the security of mail-in ballots, but majorities of all demographic subgroups believe the state can run a fair election on November 5, with 76% overall \"very\" or \"somewhat\" confident.\nSurveyUSA administered the CRI survey instrument to 1,000 Ohio adults 09/30/2024 through 10/01/2024. Of the adults, 877 are registered to vote in Ohio and were asked the questions detailed in the Topline Report. This research was conducted online among a representative nonprobability sample of Ohio adults, selected at random by Lucid Holdings LLC of New Orleans. Adult respondents were weighted to US Census American Community Survey targets for gender, age, race, education and homeownership and to 2020 recalled Presidential vote."

      "text": "Will private student loans fill the void left by the One Big Beautiful Bill? Experts discuss\nKey takeaways\n- Student loan experts are still fully assessing the One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019s fallouts. One is clear: Not all borrowers who need private loans to fill the funding gap created by new federal borrowing limits will have good enough credit to qualify.\n- Private lenders are exploring new products and underwriting criteria for subprime and deep-subprime borrowers, but this will likely mean higher interest rates \u2014 for everyone.\n- Low-income borrowers still relying fully on federal loans may struggle with the new Repayment Assistance Plan\u2019s minimum payment.\n- The experts Bankrate interviewed agree that comparison-shopping your student loan options is more vital than ever.\nPicture America\u2019s outstanding student loan debt as a 10-slice pie. About nine slices are from federal loans, and only one (or about eight percent) is held by private lenders, according to Enterval Analytics. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is sure to change those proportions, thanks to federal loans\u2019 lower lifetime borrowing limits and the end of Grad PLUS loans.\nWe don't know what [the size of] that impact is at this point, but it's certainly reasonable to believe that you could see anywhere from 50% to 100% more in private student loan originations.\u2014 Enterval CEO John Falb\nBut lending experts foresee other OBBB-driven impacts, too. For instance, not everyone who\u2019s shut out of federal borrowing will qualify for private student loans. Will graduate and professional students who have traditionally relied on federal Grad PLUS Loans \u2014 repealed by the OBBB on July 4, 2025, effective July 1, 2026 \u2014 be able to access private funding?\n\u201cI think we can make predictions that for borrowers with a very good credit history or attending programs that tend to have a long track record of leading to very good labor market outcomes, likely the answer is yes,\u201d says Lesley J. Turner, a professor of public policy at the University of Chicago. \u201cBut for borrowers with a spotty credit history or lower credit scores, programs that are not the very top in terms of labor market outcomes, I think we\u2019re just going to have to wait and see what happens.\u201d\nTo better understand the potential, looming lending gap and more, we interviewed Falb and Turner, plus two executives from private lenders \u2014 Ascent CEO Ken Ruggiero and MEFA executive director Tom Graf \u2014 as well as CampusDoor president Sara Parrish.\nThese interviews have been edited for length and clarity.\nWhat\u2019s an under-the-radar impact of the Big Beautiful Bill?\nMuch of the student loan-related provisions announced in May via the House bill preceding the OBBB remained when President Donald Trump signed it into law in July. Given that sneak peek, we already know many of the immediate effects it will have on Federal Student Aid, including:\n- A remaking of federal student loan repayment plans\n- Tighter caps on federal loan borrowing\n- Accountability for colleges whose students suffer in debt\nThe experts we spoke to more recently filled in a couple of lesser-known impacts:\nPrivate student loan interest rates may rise\nRuggiero: If they do go up\u2026 it will be because lenders are getting more comfortable supporting the down-credit consumers or their cosigners, which really speaks to the PLUS Loan impact. When you look at the credit worthiness of the parent borrowers, a lot of them found their way into the PLUS Loan because they couldn\u2019t get a [private] loan at all or at a rate they thought was reasonable relative to an alternative 9%-ish coupon, right? So, you could see the private markets opening up credit, but that comes at a cost because those loans tend not to get repaid at the same rates as [loans to borrowers with] higher credit. It\u2019s just the way credit works.\nBorrowers face higher monthly payments under new income-driven repayment plan\nTurner: Previous income-driven repayment plans for borrowers with very low income, they weren\u2019t required to make payments. They had a quote-unquote zero-dollar payment. And they could have a zero-dollar payment for the full length of time required and still receive forgiveness\u2026 Going forward, that will no longer be an option. The new income-driven repayment plan, RAP, the Repayment Assistance Plan, has a minimum payment of $10 a month, which doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but if your income is zero, $10 a month is going to be hard to come up with.\u201d\nI worry that the most vulnerable borrowers are going to be even more discouraged from taking up income-driven repayment and be more likely to end up in default.\u2014 Public policy professor Lesley J. Turner, University of Chicago\nStudent loan delinquency is worst in states that voted for President Trump.\nWill his administration help?\nRead moreWill private lenders help borrowers who would have previously relied on federal loans?\nThis is perhaps the major impact of the OBBB that deserves even more discussion than it\u2019s already gotten, including in The New York Times.\n| Federal | Private | |\n| Do you need good credit (or a creditworthy cosigner) to qualify? | No | Yes \u2014 however, some lenders have more flexibility underwriting (at the cost of higher interest rates) than others |\n| Do interest rates rise when lower-credit borrowers are offered loans? | No | Yes |\n| Can you borrow up to the cost of your attendance? | Not anymore | Yes \u2014 at most reputable lenders |\n| Is innovation on the way? | No \u2014 besides what\u2019s in the OBBB | Possibly \u2014 but will it be enough to serve borrowers now shut out from federal aid? |\nAt private lender Ascent, Ruggiero says he views the borrowing market in three segments, roughly of equal sizes:\n- Prime borrowers who can get a loan from a bank\n- Near-prime borrowers who are riskier, may not qualify with a bank, but can get funding from lenders with more flexible underwriting criteria\n- Subprime or deep-subprime borrowers who have trouble qualifying\nThat third group is the one in question. If they max out their federal aid allotment and can\u2019t qualify for private lending, perhaps because they don\u2019t have a ready-made cosigner, what happens? Will the four-year college route become even less affordable than it\u2019s proven to be in recent decades?\nWe're all trying to open up credit so that we could efficiently price the interest rate and get the student that last piece of money they need.\u2014 Ascent CEO Ken Ruggiero\nAs for the rest of our panel:\nGraf: We in the state-based agencies like MEFA want to help as many people as possible. So, we are taking a look at that. [Subprime] are harder loans to finance, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to walk down that path and see how we can do that. And there\u2019s certainly a lot of discussion out there that the for-profits and the banks are looking at this hard\u2026 The amount of conversations I\u2019ve had in the last month, since the bill was passed, with schools, with school associations, with bankers, is off the charts.\nParrish: It\u2019s just a fact that not all of the students and parents that were served by the PLUS program will be able to seamlessly transition to standard private loan products. However \u2014 big however \u2014 we have brought two products to market just this summer that are specifically tailored toward widening the lending that can occur. So, I think that the industry sees a great opportunity there\u2026 I think we\u2019re going to see more of these lenders coming to market.\nFederal student loan changes making you eye private lenders?\nHere are 7 with federal loan-like perks\nRead moreFalb: I think a lot of the burden is going to fall on the families and the schools. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see more schools be able to offer assistance to those borrowers. I know a lot of the top schools over the last several years have made commitments, such that there\u2019ll be no loans required based on their expected family contributions [or Student Aid Index]. And [the new landscape] may make it a tougher decision for some of those families\u2026 so there might be a shift towards trade schools or other career paths.\nWhat\u2019s your up-to-date private student loan borrowing advice for Bankrate readers?\nTurner: Until this law was passed, my advice was really is about the return on investment: If you are able to get a degree from a good school in a field of study that has a track record of putting students in a good position to have earnings and labor market opportunities, then if taking on a little bit more student loan debt or taking out a student loan to get into that school to be able to complete that degree, generally that\u2019s a good investment. And there\u2019s insurance against a very bad outcome due to a recession or changes in technology, like AI; there\u2019s insurance against having to make unaffordable loan payments because of the availability of these income-driven repayment plans. So, that insurance has gone away now, and so the need to really shop around and make sure that the program you\u2019re in has a good track record, that the school you\u2019re going to has support available to help students complete their degree, that has become more important.\u201d\nGraf: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of people over the years say, \u2018My kid was moving into school in a week. I needed to satisfy the bill. I didn\u2019t really have time to [shop around], I went to that low teaser [APR] and I didn\u2019t get it, but for expediency [chose that first lender].\u2019\u201d\nSo shopping around, it's not just words, it's really actions.\u2014 MEFA executive director Tom Graf\nRuggiero: \u201cIf you have to live beyond your means, which means you have to borrow more, then find out if you have a cosigner before you start applying and getting all excited about the school that\u2019s going to change your career trajectory or make your life better\u2026 And we see this a lot in undergrad with students that have multiple siblings and parents who saved to get them into freshman year and then they don\u2019t have enough money or resources or credit score to get them into sophomore or junior year. So, I would say make sure you have a total cost of attendance, line of sight for that cash or financing, and then make sure you\u2019re looking at the outcomes.\u201d\nParrish: \u201cOften, we see families start out with fully-deferred [loan] products\u2026 The benefit to flipping that on its head is that the student has repayment history right out of the gate. They\u2019re building a credit score. They\u2019re building a FICO, a credit file that has more on it than just loans in deferment. And it helps them get better interest rates in the subsequent years.\u201d\nIf you or your family can afford an interest-only payment\u2026 I would seriously consider doing that.\u2014 CampusDoor president Sara Parrish\nWhy we ask for feedback Your feedback helps us improve our content and services.

      "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Purpose. My Administration has fought and will continue to fight anti-Semitism in the United States and around the world. On December 11, 2019, I issued Executive Order 13899, my first Executive Order on Combating Anti-Semitism, finding that students, in particular, faced anti-Semitic harassment in schools and on university and college campuses. Executive Order 13899 provided interpretive assistance on the enforcement of the Nation\u2019s civil rights laws to ensure that they would protect American Jews to the same extent to which all other American citizens are protected. The prior administration effectively nullified Executive Order 13899 by failing to give the terms of the order full force and effect throughout the Government. This order reaffirms Executive Order 13899 and directs additional measures to advance the policy thereof in the wake of the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7, 2023, against the people of Israel. These attacks unleashed an unprecedented wave of vile anti-Semitic discrimination, vandalism, and violence against our citizens, especially in our schools and on our campuses. Jewish students have faced an unrelenting barrage of discrimination; denial of access to campus common areas and facilities, including libraries and classrooms; and intimidation, harassment, and physical threats and assault. A joint report by the House Committees on Education and the Workforce, Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, Oversight and Accountability, Veterans\u2019 Affairs, and Ways and Means calls the Federal Government\u2019s failure to fight anti-Semitism and protect Jewish students \u201castounding.\u201d This failure is unacceptable and ends today.\nSec. 2. Policy. It shall be the policy of the United States to combat anti-Semitism vigorously, using all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence.\nSec. 3. Additional Measures to Combat Campus Anti-Semitism. (a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department or agency (agency) shall submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, identifying all civil and criminal authorities or actions within the jurisdiction of that agency, beyond those already implemented under Executive Order 13899, that might be used to curb or combat anti-Semitism, and containing an inventory and analysis of all pending administrative complaints, as of the date of the report, against or involving institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism.\n(b) The report submitted by the Attorney General under this section shall additionally include an inventory and an analysis of all court cases, as of the date of the report, against or involving institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism and indicate whether the Attorney General intends to or has taken any action with respect to such matters, including filing statements of interest or intervention.\n(c) The Attorney General is encouraged to employ appropriate civil-rights enforcement authorities, such as 18 U.S.C. 241, to combat anti-Semitism.\n(d) The report submitted by the Secretary of Education under this section shall additionally include an inventory and an analysis of all Title VI complaints and administrative actions, including in K-12 education, related to anti-Semitism \u2014 pending or resolved after October 7, 2023 \u2014 within the Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights.\n(e) In addition to identifying relevant authorities to curb or combat anti-Semitism generally required by this section, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with each other, shall include in their reports recommendations for familiarizing institutions of higher education with the grounds for inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3) so that such institutions may monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff relevant to those grounds and for ensuring that such reports about aliens lead, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to investigations and, if warranted, actions to remove such aliens.\nSec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person."

      "text": "A measure in President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" that caps federal student loans could make it harder for medical students to finance their education or force them to abandon their medical school plans, experts say.\nStarting next year, the legislation caps the amount of federal loans students can borrow for graduate school at $100,000 over a lifetime \u2014 and sets a lifetime loan limit of $200,000 for professional programs, such as medical, dental or law school. Grad PLUS loans will also be eliminated entirely. Those changes go into effect for new borrowers on July 1, 2026.\nSome experts say the new loan limits will provide a much-needed check on soaring tuition costs, which have jumped significantly in recent decades, outpacing inflation and other household expenses. Higher costs have made college and graduate school seem out of reach for some while saddling others with crippling student loan debt.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nThese college majors have the best job prospects\nFamilies feel confident about paying for college, until tuition bills arrive\nStudent loan borrowers \u2014 how will the end of the SAVE plan impact you? Tell us\nFamilies, too, support having additional guardrails. Roughly two-thirds, or 67%, of parents said there should be limits on how much federal student loan debt students can take on, according to Sallie Mae's annual How America Pays for College report.\nHowever, for aspiring doctors, the limits may mean drastic changes. The average cost of medical school already exceeds $200,000. At private institutions, the average cost is more than $300,000, according to 2024 data from the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\"This is now a generation that has a big-time punch in the face,\" said Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association.\n'Crazy, crazy debt' for a medical degree\n\"People view medical students as future rich people and that's not the case at all,\" said Kylie Ruprecht, a third-year student at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine.\n\"You go into crazy, crazy debt to go into medicine,\" said Ruprecht, 24, \"and then repay those loans over decades.\"\nRuprecht relies on a combination of unsubsidized student loans and Grad PLUS loans to cover her costs. Once she graduates, she will begin a four-year residency to become an anesthesiologist. It will be years before she is on solid financial footing, she said.\nRuprecht declined to say how much she will owe, in total, when she graduates. Although Ruprecht is grandfathered into the old borrowing limits, her current debt load, with Grad Plus loans, would surpass the new loan caps, she said.\nIn fact, about 27.5% of medical school students and 60% of those in dentistry programs graduated with more debt in 2020 than is allowed under the new loan limits, according to calculations by higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.\n\"Medical school is the 'hair on fire' situation because the numbers are big, period, and the gaps between the federal loan limits and the program costs are sizeable,\" said Ken Ruggiero, co-founder and CEO of private education lender Ascent Funding.\nNearly every year, students and their families are borrowing more to make up the difference. Now, around 44 million Americans owe a combined $1.7 trillion for their education. Roughly 40% of that outstanding federal student loan debt is taken on for master's and PhD programs.\nA growing shortage of doctors\nThe new legislation \"doesn't affect everyone equally,\" Mukkamala said \u2014 it's students from underserved communities who will be less likely to go into the medical field as the new loan limits fall short of the total cost of attendance, which is over $200,000. \"If someone like that gets through college and looks at that number, they are going to say, 'no way,'\" he said.\nAccording to 2024 projections by the Association of American Medical Colleges, the U.S. was already on track to have a shortage of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036.\n\"The new annual and aggregate loan limits could create challenges for some medical students to finance their education, resulting in an additional financial barrier to attending medical school and ultimately worsening the current and projected physician shortage,\" said Kristen Earle, program leader for student financial aid services at the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\"We are concerned that this added barrier could deter qualified candidates, particularly low-income students, from pursuing a medical career altogether,\" Earle said.\n'An opportunity for private lenders'\nIt's likely the new limits on federal student loans will spur borrowers to find other lenders to bridge the gap, Earle said. \"The changing landscape does present an opportunity for private lenders.\"\nPrivate student loans often come into play once students have reached the federal loan limits and still need additional education financing.\n\"The new loan limits for Parent PLUS loans and graduate/professional school loans will shift some borrowing from federal loans to private student loans,\" Kantrowitz also recently told CNBC. \"This will particularly impact low-income students, who are less likely to qualify for private student loans.\"\nUnlike federal loans, private loans are not guaranteed. Private student loan lenders rely on a borrower's credit score to determine eligibility and interest rate.\n\"We want to lend to people who can afford to pay us back, that's how the model works,\" said Ascent's Ruggiero.\nPrivate loans also come with fewer safety nets and less flexible repayment options compared with federal loans.\n\"The idea behind [the loan limits] is great, but it's not putting the burden on the universities. It's putting the burden on students,\" said Ruprecht, the aspiring anesthesiologist. \"It's students who will have to scramble.\""

      "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio - Ohio colleges are reviewing federal records to find international student reinstatements after President Donald Trump\u2019s administration said Friday it is reversing its termination of legal status for hundreds of students nationwide.\nThis could allow at least 62 students who had lost their legal status to complete their studies in Ohio.\nBy Friday afternoon, three of the 10 Kent State University students had their visas revoked had been reinstated, college spokesman Eric Mansfield said. KSU notified the students, who had graduated but were allowed under their visas to have temporary employment in their fields.\nAll four Case Western Reserve University students whose records were terminated earlier in the month were returned to active status Friday afternoon, the university said.\nOther Ohio colleges said they were following the fast-evolving situation.\nThe Associated Press reported Friday that federal government lawyers read statements in California and Washington federal courts saying Immigration and Customs Enforcement was manually restoring the status of students whose records were terminated in recent weeks.\nThis comes after students nationwide filed at least 100 lawsuits, and judges in more than 50 of the cases sided with the students in temporary orders, according to Politico, which first reported the Trump reversal. More than 1,000 students across the country had lost their legal status or had visas revoked.\nFurthermore, a new AP poll shows many Americans don\u2019t support Trump\u2019s attempts to deport international students, most of whom claim in court documents they have not been convicted of any crimes.\nIn Ohio, the 62 affected students were studying at Ohio public and private colleges and universities. At least three had filed lawsuits to reinstate their status, and two had won temporary judicial orders.\nREAD MORE: Ohio legal status termations reach 62 international students across 15 colleges\nJana Al-Akhras, an immigration attorney who is representing an Ohio State University student in a case against Trump over his legal status, cautioned that the restoration of students\u2019 legal status isn\u2019t the same as restoring their visas in the eyes of the government.\nStudents have a federal student immigration record in a database known as the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. The federal government in recent weeks has terminated the status of hundreds of those student records, while maintaining in court documents that cannot be conflated with a revocation of their visas, Al-Akhras said.\nThe federal government said Friday that it\u2019s reversing the terminations while it develops a new policy framework for SEVIS terminations, she said. Al-Akhras added that she believes the federal government will attempt to develop framework that\u2019s more successful for Trump in court.\n\u201cWhat I believe is happening is ICE overplayed their hand,\u201d she said. \u201cThe courts found for the students.\u201d\nOf the remaining seven Kent State students, three were students and four had graduated and were working temporarily in their fields on the student visas, Mansfield said.\nYoungstown State University had the highest number of students with terminated status at 14.\n\u201cThis is an evolving situation, and YSU is working with the appropriate agencies and offices to inform and assist our students as quickly as possible,\u201d YSU spokeswoman Rebecca Rose said.\n\u201cWhile this appears to be a positive development, the university is eager to receive more details on the new SEVIS policy framework that is mentioned in numerous reports,\u201d said Chris Booker, spokesman for Ohio State University, where 12 students lost their legal status.\nBooker added that OSU will work to support the impacted students who are behind in their coursework.\nOn campuses throughout the state, springtime means final exams. The federal government changed the status of most students at the beginning of April.\nWalsh University, a Catholic school in North Canton, worked with its students \u2013 who left campus earlier this month \u2013 to finish the semester, said Kim Graves, a school spokeswoman.\nAs the changes to legal status became public knowledge earlier this month, the schools had said the federal government hadn\u2019t notified them beforehand that the students\u2019 status was being changed. They found out by looking at a federal database.\nTwo Ohio State University students each won temporary orders from judges requiring the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to reinstate their status and bar the government from kicking them out of the United States.\nOSU doctoral student Prasanna Oruganti\u2019s order came Wednesday from Judge Algenon Marbley, a federal judge in Columbus.\nOSU master\u2019s degree student Ahwar Sultan\u2019s order was granted Friday by Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, D.C.\nSultan appeared Thursday at the Oval on Ohio State\u2019s campus, saying he believed he was targeted for his activism for Palestinians and against Israel. He doesn\u2019t have a criminal record, said Al-Akhras, his lawyer.\nUniversity of Cincinnati PhD student Jiarong Ouyang\u2019s case is in federal court in San Francisco, part of a four-student complaint. A hearing was scheduled for Friday, according to court records, although it\u2019s not clear whether the government asked for a case dismissal due to coming reversals.\nThe AP-NORC at the University of Chicago poll shows 47% of Americans oppose Trump revoking visas of students over pro-Palestinian activism; just 28% support it and 24% neither favor or oppose.\nAmong Americans with a college degree, the poll found six in 10 strongly opposed it.\nStories by Laura Hancock\n- Ohio\u2019s Gen Z college students navigate Trump\u2019s second term, from axing DEI to student loan changes\n- Ohio says child vaccine rates are slipping; Shots a kindergartner needs\n- Ohio kindergarten vaccination rates drop 4.5% in five years, health officials warn\n- Some states already pay student teachers up to $20,000 -- Ohio might be next\nLaura Hancock covers state government and politics for The Plain Dealer and cleveland.com."

      "text": "How Does Gen Z Feel About the Election and President-elect Trump?\nProfessor\u2019s interviews provide insight into Gen Z\u2019s thoughts on politics, the election, Donald Trump and what issues are important to them\nPosted in: Humanities and Social Sciences, University\nThe 2024 presidential election was the first election in which many members of Gen Z \u2013 people born between 1997 and 2012 \u2013 were eligible to vote. How \u2013 or if \u2013 they would vote was a matter of much speculation since it was the first time many in the group had the chance.\nMontclair State University Justice Studies Professor Gabriel Rubin has been studying Gen Z for many years and over the past two years, has conducted more than 65 long-form interviews with Gen Z young people. Although the interviews are wide-ranging, among the topics discussed are politics, the state of the country, and how Gen Z feels about the political system and the recent election.\nHere are some of Rubin\u2019s insights into Gen Z, and their views on the election and President-elect Donald Trump as he prepares to take office:\nWhat does Gen Z think about politics and the election?\nIf asked to characterize the U.S. political system, Rubin says that Gen Z young people would say things like \u201cit\u2019s a mess,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s divided\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s chaotic.\u201d He feels they have become very cynical and disillusioned with the political system. Consequently, Gen Z as a group has the least political participation of any generation.\nRubin believes that this cynicism carriers over to their thoughts about the election: \u201cThey don\u2019t really like either party, don\u2019t like the way we do elections, don\u2019t like the structure of our system, don\u2019t see either party providing them with solutions to problems that they care about, don\u2019t see either party trying to reach out to them in a meaningful way.\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds to me like more Gen Z people I spoke to seem to not want to vote at all rather than have an opinion on one or the other [candidate],\u201d says Rubin. \u201cAnd I think part of that is that they\u2019re cynical about the future.\u2026They want a reason to come out and vote for someone and they don\u2019t really have one.\u201d\nWhat does Gen Z think about President-elect Trump?\nRubin says that within Gen Z, there was low enthusiasm for President Biden when he was running. Vice President Harris\u2019 entry into the race stirred interest \u2013 particularly among Gen Z women \u2013 but she didn\u2019t have much time to let people know who she was or what she would do.\n\u201cThere is a gap in enthusiasm and the Democratic side didn\u2019t have time to make their case or didn\u2019t make their case well, whereas they went against someone who was a known quantity who didn\u2019t have to define himself very much,\u201d Rubin says, referring to Trump.\nGen Z, says Rubin, \u201care fed up with the two-party system and Donald Trump\u2019s independent streak feeds into that.\u201d\nMany Gen Z men were drawn to Trump, who went on podcasts that they listened to, or had support from social media influencers who they follow. That type of media exposure resonated with young men. \u201cDonald Trump employed an expert social media campaign,\u201d notes Rubin. \u201cMany influencers were wearing MAGA hats and there was the subliminal message that manly, smart, independent people vote for Trump.\u201d\nStill, overall, Rubin feels that Gen Z have mixed feelings about Trump: \u201cMany don\u2019t like him, many do like him, and many don\u2019t care or are in between.\u201d Alluding to one of the reasons that a sizable segment of Gen Z may have voted for Trump, Rubin adds, \u201cMany are fed up with the Democratic Party.\u201d\nWhat issues are important to Gen Z?\nGen Z cares a great deal about the future, says Rubin. Many want change but don\u2019t see it happening. There are issues that are important to them that they feel are not being addressed adequately. Some of the issues shared by Gen Z young people are:\n- Economic issues \u2013 inflation, wages and the cost of everything from education to food.\n- Social justice issues \u2013 equality for women, equality for Black citizens, equality for LGBTQIA individuals, equality for the undocumented and other groups.\n- Reproductive rights \u2013 a top issue for Gen Z women.\n- The conflict in the Middle East \u2013 a huge, emotionally charged issue for Gen Z.\n- Mental health issues \u2013 always a major issue with Gen Z but the pandemic accelerated the problems.\n- Environmental issues \u2013 uncertainty about what kind of world they will be living in.\n\u201cGen Z are very concerned with inflation, crime and the banning of TikTok,\u201d Rubin says. \u201cDonald Trump speaks to those issues in addition to being welcoming of crypto, which many Gen Z people hold.\n\u201cIn my interviews, I did not hear much about the immigration issue. There seemed to be some resignation about Trump being president and while last time around there was a lot of fear about his immigration policies, [this time] the fear was mixed with more joking than in the past.\u201d\nAs with immigration, Rubin also notes a shift in attitudes on LGBTQIA issues: \u201cGen Z is more split [on LGBTQIA issues] than millennials were. Some Gen Z are obviously very supportive and many identify as LGBTQIA. But as the rights group has grown, there is increasing conservatism and pushback among some in Gen Z who feel it may go too far in certain respects,\u201d Rubin says.\n\u201cEvery culture has a counter culture and Gen Z is no exception.\u201d\nI\u2019m a ____, tell me more:\nProspective Student / Parent: Learn more about the Department of Justice Studies or Apply to Montclair State University.\nJournalist: Contact the Media Relations team for assets or to schedule an interview with Professor Rubin about this topic.

      "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio - LGBTQ youth suicide reduction, improving the state\u2019s outdated infectious disease reporting database and development of tuberculosis vaccines are among the hundreds of millions of dollars in health and medical research funding for Ohio that the federal government has axed in recent months.\nScientists, doctors and people who support them are worried. They say the cuts \u2013 expected to be in the billions nationwide by the time the administration of President Donald Trump is done \u2013 will result in job losses for those who work in research or public health. Grant terminations will constrict the economy, since companies depend on government-funded research to make medicines, vaccines and devices. And an entire generation of young scientists could be lost as new research opportunities dry up.\n\u201cWe need these federal grants in order to continue this work,\u201d said Sara Kilpatrick, Ohio executive director of American Association of University Professors. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard from professors, doctors, other researchers that people will die as a result of this research not going through.\u201d\nRELATED STORY: At least $321.8M in federal medical research grants terminated in Ohio under Trump\nSince Trump took office, about $321.8 million in health and medical funding has been cut in Ohio alone. Some of the projects were for LGBTQ research that Republicans have opposed.\nThe feds terminated $815,881 from Ohio State University researchers who were to evaluate the success of suicide reduction efforts in LGBTQ youth. Another project at Case Western Reserve University looked at the health and biology of gender-affirming vaginoplasties, from which $116,154.10 was terminated.\nBut what bewilders Dr. Stephen Carpenter, an infectious disease physician and faculty member at Case and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, is why his research on the immune response to a certain type of tuberculosis has been frozen for 90 days. He also hasn\u2019t heard back from federal officials since January on a separate tuberculosis grant needed to fund his lab.\n\u201cTuberculosis research, I can\u2019t imagine why they would want to specifically target that,\u201d he said.\nCase\u2019s immune response research will help with the development of a more effective vaccine for what\u2019s known as mycobacterium tuberculosis, Carpenter said. The team at Case is collaborating with the University of Pittsburgh and Harvard, which is leading the study and received the $60 million, seven-year grant. Case officials expect to get $6 million to $7 million total from the work, which began in 2019.\n\u201cThat money with the contact being frozen is not available for our institution in Cleveland,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just puts jobs at risk.\u201d\nThe last he heard from the National Institutes of Health on the separate project that directly funds his lab, officials were working with the U.S. Department of State for approvals, which are necessary because the project uses specimens from volunteers in Uganda through a 35-year collaboration Case has had with the country. The collaboration with a university there is essential because Uganda has a larger population with TB and HIV than can be found in the U.S., he said.\nHis lab is busy and needs the grant money.\n\u201cI have three graduate students, I have a post-doctoral fellow, I have two technicians,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cI have some other funding sources right now, and institutional funds, which will end this year. As long as my grant can be funded sometime this year, I think we\u2019ll be okay. But if not, it becomes a very difficult situation.\u201d\nThe Trump administration is attempting to trim government bloat, through cuts across dozens of agencies. But the results could be damaging to the economy.\nUnited for Medical Research, a group made up of universities and organizations such as the American Cancer Society, released a report in March showing every $1 in NIH research created $2.56 in new economic activity.\n\u201cIt makes no sense to pinch pennies on something that\u2019s really high-yield like medical research and runs really lean,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cIn research labs, we do everything ourselves. In a company you may have multiple people for one job you might have in academic research.\u201d\nIn 2023, the National Human Genome Research Institute, part of NIH, requested applications for projects that would examine genomes of diverse populations, since most genomic research has been based on populations of European origins, said Dana Crawford, a professor in the Case School of Medicine and associate director for Community and Population Research and Outreach at the Cleveland Institute for Computational Biology.\nCrawford applied for a two-year grant \u2013 considered relatively short for scientific research \u2013 to look at a gene called APOL1 after exposure to lead and cadmium. The gene is associated with changes that can cause kidney disease.\nPeople of African descent disproportionately get kidney disease. Crawford has been studying the gene in Black Americans of West African dissent, she said.\nShe said she received an email April 15 that in part said:\n\u201cIt is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research programs related to DEI. Research programs based primarily on artificial and not scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance the length in life or reduce illness. Worse are so-called diversity, equity and inclusion, \u2018DEI,\u2019 studies often used to support unlawful discrimination on the bases of race and other protected characteristics, which harms the health of Americans.\u201d\nBut NIH had itself called for the study of non-whites under the prior administration. And when applying for federal funding, if a scientist is not going to include women and minorities in the medical research, they must offer a valid scientific explanation as to why, she said.\nThe grant was for $437,443. The grant works as a funding reimbursement. She and Case officials have submitted expenses for just $52,756.50 in reimbursements thus far. Crawford could lose up to $384,686.50 if she doesn\u2019t spend it by the end of July. The project originally was supposed to end on Aug. 31, 2026.\nCrawford expects she will have to return much of the money.\n\u201cTypically, it takes us a while to do the research, so no way I want to finish the project by the end of July 2025,\u201d she said.\nA post-doctorate fellow will not be allowed to work on the project past July. Crawford said she has colleagues in her department who have enough funding to provide work for the fellow, who otherwise would have been let go.\nAt Case, professors are expected to get a level of outside funding that will cover 70% of their salaries, she said. Not every department\u2019s faculty can achieve this, but it can be doable for scientists using federal research grants.\n\u201cFaculty are very worried that we\u2019re going to get to a point where there\u2019s not enough money coming in to support all faculty, even if you\u2019re tenured,\u201d she said.\nCrawford was notified of another federal cut for a program she co-directed at Case, called the Post Baccalaureate Research Education Program, or PREP. The National Institute of General Medical Sciences offered college graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds or from undergraduate schools without extensive research a one-year, paid internship if they were interested in pursuing a doctoral degree to become a scientist. The idea was that the year of research would make them more competitive in their graduate school applications.\nThe administration cut the program, she said, deeming it to be DEI.\nCase has participated in the national program for 18 years. The school was up for a five-year, $2.7 million renewal that would have paid for 30 students, or six a year, she said.\nCrawford said the program was successful in producing scientists. Case recipients went on to get PhDs, and joint MD/PhD degrees at universities across the country.\n\u201cWe are losing a generation of scientists,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026There will be an age-group missing from scientists 20 years from now because of this disruption in funding. There\u2019s zero investment in some of these future scientists right now. They will go on to do other things because there\u2019s just no support for them.\u201d\nCarpenter, the tuberculosis researcher, has the same concern about future scientists. He is worried that young would-be researchers are exploring other careers as they read about funding disappearing.\n\u201cIf the same thing (funding cuts) keeps going year after year you end up losing \u2013 not to sound clich\u00e9 \u2013 but you end up losing like a generation of people that would have gone into research,\u201d he said.\nThe U.S. system for funding scientific research has been the envy of others around the globe, Crawford said, and no other country or private foundation can make up the loss.\n\u201cIn terms of research loss, I can\u2019t quantify,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat would have been the innovation? Science builds upon other science. Right now we\u2019re stagnant in producing that science that future science will need to propel us forward in innovative ways that we can\u2019t even think of right now.\u201d\nStories by Laura Hancock\n- Ohio\u2019s Gen Z college students navigate Trump\u2019s second term, from axing DEI to student loan changes\n- Ohio says child vaccine rates are slipping; Shots a kindergartner needs\n- Ohio kindergarten vaccination rates drop 4.5% in five years, health officials warn\n- Some states already pay student teachers up to $20,000 -- Ohio might be next\nLaura Hancock covers state government and politics for The Plain Dealer and cleveland.com."

The new federal student\u2011loan limits and the revocation of international student visas are prompting fears of financial hardship and disrupted academic plans. These developments are expected to influence student enrollment, career choices, and the broader higher\u2011education funding landscape in the coming years.",
