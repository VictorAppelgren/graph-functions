  "description": "However, here\u2019s where it gets intriguing. Disney\u2019s direct-to-consumer operations are not too far behind Netflix in scale.",
  "content": "Q3 results indicate that the streaming segment of the business is gaining significant momentum, assisting the company in alleviating certain pressures within its television segment. Nevertheless, remains the leader in the streaming arena. Netflix shares have soared nearly 33% this year, far surpassing Disney\u2019s stock increase of 4%, and its market capitalization stands at a staggering $500 billion, nearly 2.5 times Disney\u2019s $200 billion. However, here\u2019s where it gets intriguing. Disney\u2019s direct-to-consumer operations are not too far behind Netflix in scale. Over the last 12 months, Disney\u2019s DTC operations generated approximately $24.15 billion in revenue, compared to Netflix\u2019s $41 billion in streaming revenue over the same timeframe. This leads us to believe that Disney\u2019s overall worth may be undervalued given its streaming capabilities. So, could streaming propel Disney\u2019s stock value by about 2x in the upcoming years? We genuinely think that this is feasible. Here\u2019s some mathematics.\n\nDisney\u2019s streaming revenues experienced an increase of approximately 8% year-over-year, reaching around $18.37 billion in the first nine months of this fiscal year; this growth figure would be higher if we adjusted for the sale of the Disney+ Hotstar operations that occurred late last year. Revenue is anticipated to reach roughly $25 billion this year. If revenue continues to grow at about 12% annually over the next two years, it could result in approximately $31.5 billion by FY\u201927. Should Disney manage to enhance its operating margins for streaming to about 25%, compared to the current level of around 5.5%, it would equate to operating profits of about $7.1 billion. We believe this is achievable, considering Netflix reported operating margins of approximately 34% in the most recent quarter, while Disney is still in the early stages of its monetization efforts.\n\nAt present, Netflix trades at approximately 40 times its trailing operating income. If investors were to evaluate Disney\u2019s streaming operations at around 30 times operating earnings\u2014about 25% less than the current valuation of Netflix\u2019s business\u2014this would result in an enterprise value for Disney\u2019s streaming segment close to $213 billion. Surprisingly, that\u2019s equivalent to Disney\u2019s entire current market capitalization. Yet, there\u2019s much more to Disney\u2019s business, encompassing theme parks, television, and sports entertainment, which collectively generated $67 billion in revenue over the past year. Adding these elements into the equation, it\u2019s not hard to visualize Disney stock nearly doubling from its current price. Below, we outline how Disney\u2019s streaming segment is performing and how it stands in comparison to Netflix. Should you\n\nDisney has invested substantial resources into its streaming operations over the past few years, and it is finally beginning to yield results. In the most recent quarter, the direct-to-consumer segment secured $6.2 billion in revenue, marking a 6% increase despite the divestiture of the Hotstar operations last year. Operating income for this segment surged to $346 million, contrasting with a loss during the same quarter last year. Disney+ saw an addition of 1.8 million core subscribers last quarter. Disney had approximately 128 million subscribers on its core Disney+ offerings, and Hulu boasted around 55 million subscribers. Beyond subscriber growth, Disney\u2019s strategy of increasing prices has also acted as a crucial driver for revenue enhancement. For example, the ad-free Disney+ plan experienced a $2 price increase in October 2024.\n\nDisney\u2019s ad-supported tier also shows signs of flourishing. Close to half of U.S. Disney+ subscribers are now opting for the ad-supported version, with 37% of active subscribers currently enrolled in these plans as of last year. In fact, Disney has been intentionally guiding users towards ad-supported options by raising the prices of ad-free plans, and there are valid reasons behind this strategy. The wider streaming sector has increasingly focused on ad-supported tiers, as they generate greater revenue per user by profiting both from subscription fees and advertisement income. Additionally, advertising rates could be beneficial for Disney, given the capacity to better target users and Disney\u2019s emphasis on high-quality, family-friendly content.\n\nNevertheless, Netflix maintains a significant lead over Disney in the streaming competition. Although Netflix has ceased reporting its global subscriber numbers, it had a total of 301 million subscribers worldwide as of December 2024, thanks to its crackdown on account sharing and advertising initiatives. By contrast, Disney has approximately 183 million subscribers when combining Hulu and its core Disney+ services. Netflix\u2019s average revenue per user (ARPU) is also more appealing, exceeding $11.50 per month globally in 2024, as opposed to $8 for Disney+, although Hulu contributes higher average monthly revenues of around $12 per month.\n\nHow Disney\u2019s Streaming Could Be Re-rated Higher\n\nWhile Netflix has exhibited stronger momentum compared to Disney, we believe that Disney showcases immense potential due to its extensive portfolio of intellectual properties, which includes renowned franchises like Marvel and Star Wars, in addition to Pixar and its traditional animation assets. To narrow the valuation disparity, Disney must persist in enhancing its streaming margins while increasing subscriber growth. We believe this is achievable for several reasons. In terms of subscriber and revenue growth, Disney has been pushing the paid sharing feature, which was rolled out in the United States last September. This allows members to add a user outside their household for an additional fee that begins at $7 per month. In contrast, Netflix introduced a similar option in the U.S. in May 2023, with successful outcomes. We could see comparable enhancements for Disney as well.\n\nAdditionally, ESPN is set to debut a new direct-to-consumer streaming service on August 21, 2025, priced at $29.99 per month. This platform will provide access to all ESPN U.S. networks and approximately 47,000 live sporting events annually, along with features such as multiview, statistics, betting information, and fantasy tools. Beginning in 2026, ESPN will assume the exclusive U.S. partnership for all WWE Premium Live Events, including WrestleMania and Royal Rumble. The service will also integrate NFL Network and expanded NFL content, following a recent agreement that grants the NFL a 10% stake in ESPN. This initiative signifies a major advancement in Disney\u2019s sports streaming ambitions and, if executed successfully, could introduce a new growth catalyst for Disney\u2019s overarching streaming strategy and potentially attract increased attention from investors.\n\nOn the margins front, Disney\u2019s marketing expenses related to its streaming business are also declining as the platform matures, and its bundled service offerings are likely aiding in keeping subscriber churn low. Providing Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ together for as little as $17 per month has enhanced the overall stickiness of the service, improving retention and decreasing churn. We also believe that the investments Disney is making into its streaming sector will yield long-term value.\n\nDiffering from Netflix, which monetizes its content investments solely through monthly subscription fees, Disney boasts a significantly broader value chain due to its theatrical operations, theme parks, merchandise, and licensing activities. Disney\u2019s content investments are likely to prove far more sustainable given its iconic franchises, unlike Netflix, which often emphasizes standalone shows.

So, why is that?
