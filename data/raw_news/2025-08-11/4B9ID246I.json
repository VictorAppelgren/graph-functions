  "content": "A federal judge ordered the administration Monday to turn back on the pipeline of money to the National Endowment for Democracy, saying President Trump doesn\u2019t have the power to override Congress\u2019s spending decisions.\n\nJudge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump appointee to the court in Washington, said the White House had been slow-walking the organization\u2019s money \u2014 and it needs to stop.\n\nShe said the administration gave insufficient reasons for why it has withheld as much as $95 million, or 30%, of the $315 million Congress allocated to the group.\n\n\u201cThe defendants have likely unlawfully frozen the endowment\u2019s funding,\u201d she ruled.\n\nThe endowment is an independent nonprofit group that gets money from the government each year to dole out in the form of grants.\n\nWhite House officials had argued that the endowment\u2019s spending had gone off the rails in some cases and no longer aligned with \u201cadministration priorities.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s similar to the claim the administration has made in blocking funding for all manner of government agencies.\n\nBut Judge Friedrich said that was a weak excuse compared to Congress\u2019s explicit direction that the endowment be granted $315 million to \u201ccarry out its purposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sudden and unprecedented withholding of $95 million \u2014 or roughly 30% \u2014 from its anticipated budget has forced the endowment to renege on commitments,\u201d the judge ruled.\n\nShe said the president\u2019s team likely ran afoul of both procedural law and the National Endowment for Democracy Act of 1983.\n\nThe endowment says that its grants protect human rights, battle corruption and promote democratic institutions.",
