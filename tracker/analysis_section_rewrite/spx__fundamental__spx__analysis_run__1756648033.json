      "feedback": "**Feedback – Analysis Draft (Ether)**  \n\n1. **Canonical Handle Mismatch** – The draft discusses Ether, but “ether” is not a listed canonical handle (brent, wti, gold, copper, ust2y, ust10y, spx, ndx, eurostoxx50, dxy).  \n   *Action*: Either drop the Ether narrative or re‑frame it around a valid handle (e.g., “US Treasury 10‑yr” for a related macro view).  \n\n2. **Missing Catalyst Window** – No explicit, dated catalyst is cited (e.g., Fed policy change, regulatory announcement).  \n   *Action*: Add a concrete window (e.g., “Fed’s September 2025 policy meeting” or “July 2025 SEC Project Crypto announcement”) and link it to the price move.  \n\n3. **No Quantified Direction/Magnitude** – The draft states “10–20 % upside” but lacks a clear, handle‑linked range and horizon.  \n   *Action*: Specify a precise range (e.g., “US Treasury 10‑yr yields expected to rise 30–50 bp by Q4 2025”) and tie it to the asset.  \n\n4. **Causal Chain Not Explicit** – The chain “Fed policy → risk‑on sentiment → institutional flows → ETH demand → price” is implied but not mapped to a canonical handle.  \n   *Action*: Explicitly map each link to a handle (e.g., “Fed policy → DXY → US Treasury 10‑yr → ETH price”) and cite sources.  \n\n5. **Citation Issues** – The draft references “OGK8WLL69” but does not embed inline citations or source IDs for each claim.  \n   *Action*: Replace bracketed IDs with inline citations (e.g., “(OGK8WLL69)”) and ensure every substantive claim has a source.  \n\n**Conclusion** – The draft fails the acceptance gate (no canonical handle mapping, no catalyst window). Rewrite to focus on a valid handle, include a dated catalyst, quantify the trade direction, and provide inline citations. If Ether must remain, note that it is outside the canonical set and therefore cannot be accepted under current rules.",
