      "feedback": "The draft already satisfies the 2 Up/2 Down movers and the 3–6 month Outlook construct, and it credibly anchors lines to many source IDs, but it falls short on probability grounding, explicit first-principles causality, and tight, trigger-driven discipline; the Up/Down lines over-lean on narrative events (AI/a lot of auto/equity themes) without a clean, micro-to-macro chain or clearly evidenced probability anchors, and several numbers (e.g., 60%, 55%, 40%, 35%) are not clearly derived from material weights. Actionable edits: (1) Embed a crisp first-principles causal chain for each line (micro anchors like household balance, durable-goods demand, and AI productivity feeding credit/investment channels that drive asset prices) and tie each line to a single dominant driver; (2) ground probability estimates in material-derived weights or explicit event likelihood (e.g., Up around the Regime A weight ~50%, Up sub-line ~55–60% with NL5YYTLF2 as basis; Down lines ~25–40% with B/C risks), and attach short, in-line justification; (3) tighten each line’s What to watch into 2–3 compact bullets that implicitly include triggers and invalidation (e.g., Nvidia/STBVARD8F momentum, Pacaso/Range/Mogul expansions, or regime-shift signals) without introducing new data; (4) ensure each line’s trigger and invalidation are clearly reflected in the Outlook (a single-trigger and a clear invalidation threshold for regime shifts, e.g., sustained inflation/ yields or AI momentum collapse, anchored to EPJYXB7DX, Y6SQOEK69, etc.); (5) scrub every numeric claim to sourced material only (e.g., 25% automation exposure NL5YYTLF2, 21% YoY Pacaso growth UPV3X2MQ6, Ford EV ramp 22PL3Q360, 0–3 week policy/inflation signals 218AGGUXB) and remove any extrapolated numbers; (6) harmonize horizons across lines (reserve 0–3 week, 1–3 month, and 3–6 month markers) and ensure the 0–3 week content is reflected if you keep it in Movers; (7) tighten the formatting so each mover line uses exactly five fields with consistent driver phrasing and IDs, and keep the Outlook line concise but complete (Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence %); (8) add a concise base-case sentence at the top of Movers to state the first-principles map (AI productivity plus durable-goods resilience dampens volatility, policy premia re-price risk, with regime weights driving asset rotations) and ensure all four lines map to that framework. If you implement these edits, the piece will deliver a world-class, fully grounded swing-trade outline with transparent probabilities, disciplined triggers/invalidation, and tight source-consistency.",
