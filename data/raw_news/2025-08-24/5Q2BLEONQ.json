  "title": "The Economics Of Pleasure: How A New Approach To Drug Use Could Save Millions",
  "description": "Billions are spent fighting drugs. Recognizing why people really use them could save money, save lives and transform global drug policy.",
  "content": "The conversation around drugs has long been framed by cost. Policymakers calculate the billions lost every year to productivity gaps, hospitalizations, law enforcement and incarceration. The U.S. alone spends an $193 billion annually dealing with the fallout of illicit drug use, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nYet there is a blind spot. People do not only use drugs because of the usual suspects: trauma, poverty or pathology. They also use them because they feel good. Pleasure. Connection. Belonging. A stronger sense of self.\n\nThere is an old joke that goes: \u201cDo you know what\u2019s the problem with drugs? That they feel too good.\u201d And it is spot on. Ignoring this basic human driver has a cost of its own.\n\nResearchers and frontline harm-reduction workers are now introducing a radical, almost counterintuitive idea: what if drug policy and education started not from fear, but from pleasure? What if acknowledging the real reasons people use could reduce overdoses, improve mental health and save governments millions?\n\nAs Valentine and Fraser noted in their 2008 study of methadone patients: \u201cAlthough pleasurable and problematic drug use are often thought to be mutually exclusive, pleasure is reported from both the effects of drugs such as heroin and methadone and from the social worlds of methadone maintenance treatment.\u201d\n\nThis is the frontier of \u201cpleasure management\u201d or \u201cpleasure maximization,\u201d a new way of thinking about consumption that blends economics, public health and lived experience. Daniel Bear and colleagues argue that harm reduction too often \u201cforegrounds risks at the expense of benefits.\u201d Their framework of Mindful Consumption and Benefit Maximization (MCBM) begins by asking users why they consume, what benefits they seek and how to reduce risks while preserving those benefits.\n\nZara Snapp, director of Instituto RIA in Mexico, reminds us that this is not a new invention. She points to ancestral traditions across Latin America where psychoactive plants were used to foster vision, knowledge and connection to the sacred. In this sense, today\u2019s debates about pleasure management are part of a much longer human story about using substances for meaning and wellbeing, not only risk.\n\nSilvia Inchaurraga, a psychoanalyst and president of ARDA (the Harm Reduction Association of Argentina), frames it in terms of rights: \u201cThe concept of harm reduction cannot stand without legitimizing the right of people to consume drugs\u2026 interventions must always start from recognition of this right and the user as a citizen.\u201d She argues that pleasure management challenges abstentionist logics that seek to eliminate risk altogether, instead of acknowledging that people use for multiple reasons, including wellbeing.\n\nWhy People Really Use\n\nA 2017 systematic review by Guise and colleagues looked at 41 studies on why people initiate injection. They found that choices were rarely about desperation alone. People began injecting to seek pleasure, respond to rising tolerance, secure belonging and cope with trauma.\n\nSexual pleasure is another driver. In a study of African American MDMA users, Khary Rigg found four main motives: altering the effects of marijuana and alcohol, enhancing sexual pleasure, prolonging performance and encouraging partners to experiment. As one participant put it, ecstasy was a tool for \u201cfreaky\u201d sexual experiences.\n\nThese findings break with stereotypes. While White ravers often describe MDMA use in terms of empathy or connection with music, Rigg\u2019s participants focused on sex. The difference is more than cultural nuance. It is a reminder that pleasure is not monolithic. Harm-reduction messages need to be specific to the communities they aim to serve.\n\nEven in contexts we label \u201cproblematic,\u201d pleasure is part of the story. Valentine and Fraser\u2019s methadone patients said they enjoyed not only the effects of heroin or methadone but also the social life that treatment programs created. Methadone clinics were not just about survival. They were also spaces of joy and belonging.\n\nIf pleasure motivates use, it also motivates care: people are not reckless, and often develop their own strategies to balance enjoyment with safety.\n\nIn Brooklyn, queer nightlife workers told researcher Alex Mandler how they carefully balanced chemicals to sustain performance and avoid harm. Far from reckless, this was intentional \u201ccuration\u201d of highs and safety.\n\nSnapp sees the same thing across Latin America. \u201cManaging pleasure means understanding that people seek connection, empathy and a sense of being interconnected. Substances can help foster that, to generate greater awareness,\u201d she told me. She also points to drug-checking services like Checa Tu Sustancia in Mexico and \u00c9chele Cabeza in Colombia, where users are asked why they consume, how often, and why they test their substances. \u201cThe answers were simple: to enjoy it, to feel good. And the outcome is fewer ambulance calls, fewer overdoses, and less strain on public resources.\u201d\n\nIn Argentina, Inchaurraga and ARDA have carried this into public campaigns for decades, with slogans like \u201cSi te picas, l\u00e9eme\u201d [If you inject yourself, read me] (2000), \u201cSi consum\u00eds igual ten\u00e9s derechos\u201d [If you consume, you still have rights] (2005), and most recently, \u201cChequeaste tus pastis?\u201d [Did you check your pills?] (2024). These messages, shared in clubs, festivals and universities, normalize dialogue about both risks and pleasures, making harm reduction visible in everyday life.\n\nFor Snapp, these services embody collective care. They are not only technical interventions but spaces where people can talk openly about their practices, share strategies and make better decisions together. She also contrasts this with how alcohol and tobacco are normalized despite the enormous harm they can cause, arguing that pleasure management offers \u201canother side of the coin,\u201d a chance to build healthier cultures of enjoyment and self-regulation.\n\nSheila Vakharia, managing director of research at the Drug Policy Alliance, reminds us that harm reduction itself was born as a peer-led practice: people who used drugs organized to keep each other safe, insisting that their motives, from coping to connection to joy, were valid. \u201cHarm reduction was started by people who use drugs to keep one another safe\u2026 many harm reductionists acknowledge that maximizing pleasure while reducing risk should be a key part of the work,\u201d she says.\n\nEven formal services reflect this shift. In Frankfurt, Duncan and colleagues documented how supervised drug-consumption rooms created not only safer conditions but also new kinds of pleasure: safety, dignity and belonging (Duncan et al., 2017).\n\nTaken together, these stories show that pleasure management is not an abstract concept. It is visible in clubs, in clinics and in communities. What is missing is recognition and support from policymakers.\n\nIf people and communities are already managing their consumption, the question becomes: why is policy not keeping up, and what is that lag costing us?\n\nMost public spending on drugs is reactive and punitive. Police budgets, courtrooms, prison beds and emergency room visits absorb the majority. Very little goes to preventing those costs by addressing why people use in the first place.\n\nThese are not inevitable costs. As a shows, they are the direct result of the global war on drugs, a policy that not only maximizes harm but also disproportionately impacts low-income communities, women, Black people and Latinos. In other words, governments are not just overspending, they are overspending on policies that worsen the very problems they claim to solve.\n\nThe research is clear. In a study of sexual minority adults using the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, Yockey and colleagues found that 21.9% reported tranquilizer use in the past year. Risk factors included being female, over 35, polydrug use and loss of pleasure in once pleasurable activities. In other words, depression and stress were fueling consumption. Addressing these realities before they spiral into crises is far less expensive than waiting for overdoses or hospitalizations.\n\nInchaurraga emphasizes the economic dimension: \u201cPolicies that criminalize end up multiplying costs. What we need are policies that reduce harm and recognize the motivations of use. That is where the savings are.\u201d Her association\u2019s programs back this up with numbers. In one early study of injection-kit distribution in Rosario, 5 to 6 of every 10 people reached entered health services for HIV testing, counseling or treatment. More recently, ARDA deployed more than 100 harm-reduction devices at parties across five provinces, reached over 21,000 people with information, and tested 1,600 drug samples, finding that 18% contained something different than expected. These interventions reduce overdoses, cut hospitalizations and connect users to care, lowering long-term costs.\n\nVakharia adds a policy perspective: \u201cThe policies we have drafted and passed to allow for adult use of marijuana are probably the clearest illustration of our acknowledging pleasure as a motivator.\u201d\n\nAnd Snapp connects the dots to human rights: \u201cAccording to the United Nations, more than 83% of people who use illegal drugs do so without developing problematic patterns. This framework responds to them and the need for information, services that don\u2019t demand abstinence and ultimately a safe supply through legal regulation.\u201d She also notes that while resistance persists (critics often claim that talking about pleasure \u201cpromotes use\u201d), some governments are beginning to adopt the language. In Uruguay and even in Iztapalapa and Mexico City, local officials have started to frame public programs around the idea of managing pleasure, signaling that the concept is entering mainstream policy debates.\n\nInchaurraga observes the same dynamic in Argentina: public health discourse often accepts harm reduction only as HIV prevention, but resists legitimizing pleasure as a health goal. This, she warns, leaves rights unaddressed and perpetuates stigma.\n\nCompare this with what governments currently spend on police, prisons and courts. These investments not only fail to reduce use but also compound costs through stigma and exclusion. International models back up the alternative. Studies of supervised consumption spaces in Europe and Canada show that these services prevent HIV infections, reduce emergency calls and lower overdose deaths. Each avoided overdose can save tens of thousands of dollars in hospital care. Every avoided arrest frees up courtrooms and prison cells.\n\nThe real cost of drug use is not that people seek pleasure. It is that policy continues to ignore it.\n\nThe evidence points in one direction. Harm reduction alone is not enough. To cut costs and improve lives, policy must embrace pleasure management.\n\nPleasure management is not a break from harm reduction but an extension of it. For decades, grassroots harm-reduction programs have recognized the dimensions of pleasure and the right to sovereignty over one\u2019s body. What is new is the visibility and urgency of these approaches in a global landscape where criminalization has failed, and people are politicizing to demand pragmatic, rights-based responses.\n\nBear and colleagues\u2019 Mindful Consumption and Benefit Maximization framework is one proposal. It critiques harm reduction for focusing on risks while sidelining benefits, and urges educators to help people reflect on motives, desired effects and strategies to maximize benefits while minimizing harms.\n\nOther researchers, like David Nutt in the UK, have reinforced this point with comparative harm rankings. His found that alcohol, a legal drug, causes more overall harm than heroin or crack cocaine\u2014largely because of its massive impact on others through violence, accidents, and social costs. The implication is clear: prohibitionist classifications do not match real-world evidence of harm.\n\nSnapp and Instituto RIA stress the cultural and political importance: \u201cWe see this as deeply linked to self-care and collective care\u2026 understanding that people who use substances, even controversial ones, do so, often, to feel good or to alleviate some pain, which also connects to wellbeing.\u201d She frames it not just as a pragmatic tool but as part of a rights-based drug policy, arguing that recognizing pleasure is also about protecting dignity and ensuring that people who use drugs are treated as people with agency, not pathologized or excluded. These programs also serve as important spaces to politicize and organize the drug policy reform movement.\n\nInchaurraga and her colleagues at ARDA take a governance view: interventions should begin from recognition of the right to consume as citizens, not criminalize it.\n\nEven in supervised consumption rooms, Duncan et al. found that pleasure and safety can coexist. People reported new forms of satisfaction in being treated with dignity and care. Mandler\u2019s work in Brooklyn nightlife shows the same: users already regulate dosage, timing and substance choice to balance fun with function. These grassroots strategies are proof that pleasure management is real and scalable.\n\u2022 Mindful use. Integrate MCBM concepts into education so people think intentionally about consumption.\n\u2022 Tailored messaging. Recognize that motivations differ by culture, gender and context. Harm reduction must reflect those realities to work.\n\nAs Vakharia concludes: \u201cPleasure and recreation are among the biggest motivators for substance use of all kinds, so it needs to be incorporated into conversations about safety and policy.\u201d\n\nDrug policy has long been guided by fear. Billions are poured into punishment and cleanup while one of the biggest drivers of use, pleasure, is ignored. The result is a system that is both costly and ineffective.\n\nThe evidence from researchers and practitioners points to a different path. Mindful consumption, community spaces and culturally tailored messaging all show that pleasure management is not only possible, it is already underway. People are planning, moderating, sharing and experimenting responsibly. Services that acknowledge this reality reduce emergencies, save lives and cut costs.\n\nThese shifts are not only local. At the international level, the consensus that has long underpinned global drug control is starting to crack. In 2025, Colombia led a historic resolution at the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs , securing the first-ever independent review of the drug control treaties. For the first time, prohibition itself will be under external scrutiny. Pleasure management and harm reduction are part of this broader paradigm shift away from punishment and toward evidence, rights, and pragmatism.\n\nFor governments, the choice is stark. Keep spending on prison beds and ER visits, or redirect a fraction of that money toward interventions that reflect why people actually use drugs. The return on investment is obvious.\n\nPleasure management is not a luxury. It is rights-based, pragmatic economics and smarter public health. And above all, more just and more humane.\n\nDisclaimer: This article discusses emerging research and policy debates around drug use and harm reduction.

      "text": "Once dismissed as a beginner\u2019s crutch for people who couldn\u2019t roll their own, the humble joint, now widely sold as a \u201cpre-roll,\u201d has become one of cannabis\u2019 hottest commodities: potent, precise and proudly pre-packed. According to a new industry report from Custom Cones USA, Headset and Lake Superior State University, Americans sparked more than 316 million pre-rolls in 2024, fueling $3.1 billion in sales and claiming more than 15% of the entire legal market.\nWhat\u2019s behind the boom? Two things: infusion and innovation.\nAccording to the report, infused pre-rolls (joints enhanced with concentrates like hash, oil or kief) now dominate the category with a 44.4% market share, while multi-pack formats like five- and ten-packs make up nearly half of all sales. Potency, price and brand identity are the top drivers for consumers, 80% of whom consume cannabis multiple times per day.\nThis shift has sparked a transformation in how pre-rolls are made and marketed. Automation is now the norm among top brands, with sophisticated infusion tech and premium materials setting the best apart. Some leaders, like California-based Jeeter, which built a $245 million business on kief-and-diamond-dusted joints, have bet big on luxury appeal. Others, like Dragonfly Cannabis, cracked the code on volume, selling more than 12 million units in 2024 at just $2.38 each \u2013on average.\nAnd while local champions still matter\u2014single-state operators like Goodlyfe Farms and The Refinery earned top spots\u2014multi-state operators (MSOs) and publicly traded companies are driving scale and consolidation. GTI-backed Dogwalkers and STIIIZY, operating in five states, show how national footprints and capital access translate into dominance.\nThis isn\u2019t just a boom. It\u2019s a battle for brand loyalty. And the pre-roll is ground zero.\nWho\u2019s Got The Fire? Meet The Top 10 Pre-Roll Brands\nFrom budget bangers to luxury-infused collectibles, these are the brands that moved the most joints in 2024. Some sell millions in a single state. Others ride national footprints and automation. But all ten have figured out how to roll product, identity and demand into market dominance.\nNotably, among the ten best-selling pre-roll brands of 2024, none were publicly led or founded by women, highlighting a persistent gender gap at the top of the cannabis value chain. While STIIIZY has partnered with social equity entrepreneurs like Cindy De La Vega at the retail level, ownership and brand leadership in the pre-roll space remain overwhelmingly male-dominated.\nSo, who\u2019s winning the joint wars? Here\u2019s a look at the ten brands that rolled their way to the top in 2024, each with a different formula for domination.\n1. Jeeter\nTotal Sales: $245.3M | Units Sold: 9.96M | Market Share: 8.0%\nAverage Price: $24.62 | Profit Margin: 34%\nJeeter is the undisputed leader of the U.S. pre-roll market. With roughly $245 million in sales across four states, the California-based brand more than doubled its closest competitor in revenue. Known for its diamond-and-oil-infused Baby Jeeter five-packs, often rolled in kief and packed in collectible glass jars, the company has built a cult following and a premium reputation.\nThe brand\u2019s bold packaging, flashy collaborations (from Bob Marley to Dwyane Wade), and flavor-forward drops helped Jeeter lock in 8% of the national market share, despite ranking second in units sold. With an average price of $24.62 and a 34% profit margin, Jeeter\u2019s formula of potency, branding and cultural clout is clearly paying off.\n2. STIIIZY\nTotal Sales: $110.5M | Units Sold: 5.07M | Market Share: 3.61%\nAverage Price: $21.79 | Profit Margin: 41%\nFounded in California and known for its sleek branding and high-potency products, STIIIZY has become a dominant player in the infused pre-roll space. In 2024, the company pulled in more than $110 million in sales across five states, powered by its popular \u201c40\u2019s\u201d line of joints and blunts infused with live resin and coated in kief. With a 3.6% share of national pre-roll revenue, STIIIZY ranks second in total sales and leads the entire market in average profit margin.\nUnlike rivals chasing celebrity endorsements, STIIIZY leans into street credibility, polished design and concentrate heritage. Its Blue Dream \u201c40\u2019s\u201d five-pack was the best-selling pre-roll product in America last year, cementing STIIIZY\u2019s status as a potency-first powerhouse with premium packaging to match.\n3. Dogwalkers\nTotal Sales: $77.0M | Units Sold: 3.4M | Market Share: 2.51%\nAverage Price: $22.66 | Profit Margin: 43%\nDogwalkers built a national brand by thinking small\u2014literally. Known for its \u201cMini Dog\u201d 0.35g pre-rolls, the brand helped turn petite cones into a preferred format for solo smokers. With $77 million in 2024 sales across nine states, Dogwalkers holds the No. 3 spot in the country, driven by niche sizing, premium flower and an identity rooted in real walks with a real dog.\nFounded in Illinois in 2016 and now part of multi-state, publicly traded operator Green Thumb Industries, Dogwalkers markets itself as the go-to for mindful, manageable dosing. Its off-size pre-rolls come in stylish green or white tins and tubes, while its charitable arm, the Bailey Legacy Fund, supports local animal rescues. No celebrity endorsements here; just consistent product, sharp branding and some of the highest margins in the business.\n4. Cali-Blaze\nTotal Sales: $61.8M | Units Sold: 8.17M | Market Share: 2.02%\nAverage Price: $7.57 | Profit Margin: 42%\nDon\u2019t let the name fool you: Cali-Blaze isn\u2019t from California. This Michigan-based brand skyrocketed to the No. 4 spot nationally with over 8 million units sold in just three states. Built on volume, flavor and affordability, Cali-Blaze specializes in infused pre-rolls like the Tarantula and Donut Blunt, some hitting 41% THC, at under $8 each.\nFounded in 2022, the brand has become a staple in Michigan and Colorado dispensaries, offering more than 30 flavor-forward SKUs and focusing on its own indoor-grown flower. No celebrity drops, no marketing gimmicks: just eye-popping potency, wide variety and serious loyalty from budget-conscious consumers and budtenders alike.\n5. Presidential\nTotal Sales: $43.3M | Units Sold: 2.58M | Market Share: 1.41%\nAverage Price: $16.79 | Profit Margin: 49%\nWith its bold claim as the \u201cWorld\u2019s Strongest\u201d pre-roll, Presidential Cannabis secures the No. 5 spot nationally. Founded in 2012 by former pro basketball player Everett Smith, the California-based brand helped pioneer the infused category, combining THC distillate and kief with moonrock-packed cones and blunts. In 2024, Presidential sold 2.6 million units across four states, generating over $43 million in revenue with a hefty 49% profit margin.\nPresidential's high-potency products (like 1.5g blunts and triple-infused minis? lean into flashy packaging, cigar-style branding and a legacy of innovation. The brand doesn\u2019t just sell a smoke; it sells swagger. With collaborations like Pink Cookies with THC Design and Skywalker with Rove, plus a party-heavy marketing style, Presidential keeps its image loud, proud and potent.\n6. Simpler Daze\nTotal Sales: $31.5M | Units Sold: 4.33M | Market Share: 1.03%\nAverage Price: $7.26 | Profit Margin: 46%\nBuilt on affordability and volume, Simpler Daze clinches the No. 6 spot nationally, thanks in large part to Michigan\u2019s massive appetite for pre-rolls. The brand, launched in 2021 by Glorious Cannabis, racked up $31.5 million in sales and moved over 4.3 million units across just two states, making it the third-highest pre-roll seller by volume in the country.\nThough the brand\u2019s price point hovers just above $7, Simpler Daze deals exclusively in infused joints under its Fire Styxx line, like the top-selling Unicorn Tears and Grape Escape, both THCa-infused. Packaged in minimalist doob tubes with stylized skeleton branding, the focus isn\u2019t flash: it\u2019s access. Marketed as \u201csimple, good weed,\u201d Simpler Daze prioritizes terpene content and a mellow, sessionable high aimed at everyday consumers.\n7. Goodlyfe Farms\nTotal Sales: $29.6M | Units Sold: 7.10M | Market Share: 0.97%\nAverage Price: $4.17 | Profit Margin: 45%\nProving that volume can rival price, Michigan-based Goodlyfe Farms cracks the national Top 10 despite selling exclusively in one state. With $29.6 million in pre-roll sales on over 7.1 million units, Goodlyfe ranks fourth overall in total pre-roll volume sold (more than heavyweights like STIIIZY and Dogwalkers) at an average retail price of just $4.17. Nearly all of its products are infused, including its bestsellers like Unicorn Piss and Apple Fritter.\nFounded in 2021 by Adam Piot and partners, Goodlyfe has grown its outdoor and greenhouse operation to 300 acres and recently expanded to New York. Its sun-grown cannabis is central to the brand\u2019s identity, marketed as terpene-rich and sustainable. Packaged in bright doob tubes with RAW cones and custom labels, Goodlyfe's affordable, high-potency infused joints have earned it cult status in Michigan\u2019s price-sensitive market.\n8. Dragonfly Cannabis\nTotal Sales: $29.3M | Units Sold: 12.34M | Market Share: 0.96%\nAverage Price: $2.38 | Profit Margin: 49%\nDragonfly Cannabis ranks eighth in total sales but first in the nation for pre-roll volume, moving more than 12.3 million units in 2024; more than any other brand on the list. Based solely in Michigan, the brand owes much of its reach to a highly accessible average price of just $2.38 per unit. That affordability doesn\u2019t come at the expense of profit, though, with Dragonfly posting a 49% margin. Its $29.3 million in pre-roll revenue reflects both the strength of Michigan\u2019s market and the power of high-volume strategy.\nAll of Dragonfly\u2019s products are grown on a 150-acre outdoor and greenhouse farm in southwestern Michigan, where the company leans into organic methods and community engagement. Its lineup includes both classic and infused pre-rolls, with sleek black and red packaging and infused options featuring distillate, rosin or live rosin. Dragonfly\u2019s impact also extends beyond the retail shelf: the company donates locally to schools, food pantries, and veterans' organizations, building a reputation as a brand grounded in both value and values.\n9. Lowell Herb Co.\nTotal Sales: $28.3M | Units Sold: 1.00M | Market Share: 0.92%\nAverage Price: $28.27 | Profit Margin: 51%\nA pioneer in premium branding and legal market presence, Lowell Herb Co. lands at No. 9 with over $28 million in 2024 pre-roll sales. While its unit volume is lower than most Top 10 contenders\u2014just over 1 million\u2014its high price point of $28.27 per item and sleek, sustainable packaging reflect its elevated market positioning. Based originally in Southern California and now operating nationally from its Hudson Valley HQ, Lowell is one of the most widely recognized names in American cannabis, with a trailblazing legacy that includes opening the country\u2019s first cannabis caf\u00e9.\nLowell\u2019s pre-rolls, especially its signature 0.35g multi-packs and blended single-origin smokes, emphasize craftsmanship, terpene diversity and eco-conscious design. Each offering, from the \u201cMind Safari\u201d 10-pack to the \u201cZen\u201d and \u201cHappy\u201d 6-packs, maintains a refined, earthy aesthetic in packaging and product alike. With celebrity backers like Mark Ronson and Sarah Silverman, a commitment to social justice hiring and iconic brand storytelling centered on cannabis rebel \u201cBull\u201d Lowell, the company continues to blend heritage with modern luxury in the pre-roll category.\n10. Good Day Farm\nTotal Sales: $25.9M | Units Sold: 1.33M | Market Share: 0.84%\nAverage Price: $19.45 | Profit Margin: 46%\nBased in the South and surging thanks to Missouri\u2019s adult-use market, Good Day Farm closes out the Top 10 with $25.9 million in pre-roll sales and over 1.3 million units sold, all from just one state. Though it began as a medical cannabis brand serving Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, Good Day Farm\u2019s entry into Missouri\u2019s recreational market in 2023 made it a dominant force in the state, controlling 16.5% of pre-roll revenue and 12.3% of units sold there. With an average item price of $19.45 and 525 products on offer, the brand has become a go-to for both infused and traditional smokers, and its national position could be even higher if other states\u2019 data were included.\nThe company\u2019s Good Day J\u2019s line features classic pre-rolls in resealable mylar pouches, while Super J\u2019s bring potency with distillate infusion and kief coating, often packed in jars with bold branding and gold-inked slogans. For a luxury twist, its Southern Sweets and Good Day Blunts come hand-rolled with glass tips. But Good Day Farm isn\u2019t just about high-quality joints: it\u2019s a mission-driven brand supporting breast cancer research through its \"Titty Sprinkles\" strain and championing criminal justice reform with Last Prisoner Project partnerships. In the heartland, Good Day Farm is lighting up the charts, ethically and economically.\nInfused Pre-Rolls Dominate As Automation Becomes Standard\nInfused pre-rolls have solidified their role as the category\u2019s primary growth engine. In 2024, they accounted for 44.4% of total pre-roll sales\u2014nearly $1.4 billion\u2014and 29.7% of units sold, according to the report. This reflects a steady rise in market share over recent years and highlights consumer appetite for high-potency, flavor-rich products. While overall pre-roll unit sales increased by 13.5% year-over-year, infused unit sales grew 23.8%, far outpacing the growth of traditional pre-rolls.\nDriving this surge is widespread infusion innovation. Survey data in the report shows that 86% of brands now produce infused pre-rolls, with distillate remaining the most commonly used input. However, 58% of brands say they expect to see more consumer demand for solventless options like rosin and ice water hash in the coming year, signaling a shift toward more premium, clean-label concentrates.\nMost leading producers have adopted semi- or fully-automated cone-filling and infusion systems, allowing them to meet demand for multi-pack formats and novelty SKUs without sacrificing consistency. This shift is particularly important in price-sensitive markets like Michigan, where brands like Dragonfly and Simpler Daze rely on automation to drive volume while preserving margins.\nStill, the report cautions that quality and consumer trust remain essential. Brands with clear terpene content, consistent effects and strong QC practices are earning loyalty and repeat purchases, especially among daily consumers.\nMulti-Packs And Minis: Format Wars In The Pre-Roll Aisle\nAs the category matures, consumers are getting choosier. Not just about what's inside the cone, but how it's packaged. In 2024, five- and ten-packs gained momentum as consumers looked for value, convenience and shareability. Nearly half of all pre-rolls sold now come in multi-pack formats.\nThis trend is especially evident among premium brands. Good Day Farm's five-pack Super J\u2019s and Lowell Herb Co.'s 10-pack \"Mind Safari\" ranked among their top-selling SKUs. For high-end buyers, these packs offer better price-per-gram and an upscale, giftable presentation. For retailers, multi-packs boost basket sizes and encourage brand stickiness.\nMeanwhile, mini pre-rolls\u2014typically 0.3 to 0.5 grams each\u2014are emerging as a top pick for wellness-minded and casual consumers. From Dogwalkers' Mini Dogs to Lowell's 35s, minis serve newer users, those seeking smaller doses or on-the-go sessions. Brands are also experimenting with hybrid packs, featuring multiple strains or effects in a single unit.\nThis fragmentation in format underscores the evolution of pre-rolls from novelty item to everyday staple. Whether you're microdosing, sharing, or stretching your dollar, there's now a joint for that.\nWhat\u2019s Next For The Joint Economy?\nAs the report makes clear, the U.S. pre-roll market is no longer niche. It\u2019s a $3.1 billion juggernaut defined by volume, potency and brand power. In 2025, expect continued growth in infused formats, further automation and greater segmentation by format and price point.\nConsolidation is also likely, with MSOs, venture-backed brands and public companies eyeing acquisitions or expansion in this high-margin category. At the same time, niche and local players who master efficiency and identity\u2014like Dragonfly and Goodlyfe\u2014can still carve out major wins.\nIn the war for weed consumers, the humble joint is now the MVP. And the brands who roll with precision, purpose and personality will define the future of the category."

      "text": "More than a decade into America\u2019s state-by-state experiment with cannabis legalization, the results are no longer theoretical. Government data now confirms what early advocates envisioned\u2014and what critics warned against: legal cannabis is reshaping public policy. The numbers tell a clear story, one grounded in billions in state tax revenue and a measurable decline in teen marijuana use.\nAccording to two reports from the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP), legal adult-use cannabis sales have generated more than $24.7 billion in state tax revenue since 2014. Much of that money is being directed toward education, healthcare, infrastructure, substance use prevention and community reinvestment. At the same time, teen cannabis use has declined in most legal states, defying long-held fears that legalization would increase youth access and consumption.\n\u201cLegalization does not increase youth cannabis use. In fact, evidence suggests the opposite,\u201d MPP\u2019s youth impact report states.\nTracking The $24.7 Billion Impact Of Cannabis Taxation\nAdult-use cannabis sales began in Colorado and Washington in 2014. Since then, tax revenue has grown steadily across more than 20 states that now regulate cannabis for adult use.\nIn 2024 alone, states brought in over $4.4 billion, a record-setting year. And by March 2025, total cannabis tax collections reached $24.7 billion, according to MPP.\nThe five top-earning states to date (through 2024) are:\n- California: $6.72 billion\n- Washington: $4.62 billion\n- Colorado: $2.62 billion\n- Illinois: $2.42 billion\n- Michigan: $1.62 billion\nOther states surpassing the billion-dollar mark include Nevada ($1.26 billion), Massachusetts ($1.2 billion) and Oregon ($1.13 billion), showing that tax impacts are not limited to early adopters or coastal markets.\nThese figures reflect state-level adult-use cannabis excise and sales taxes only. They exclude medical cannabis revenue, licensing fees, federal taxes and local municipal taxes, which, in some cases, add tens of millions more (e.g., Denver alone collected an estimated $39.6 million in 2024).\nWhere The Cannabis Tax Money Goes: Public Services And Equity\nLegal cannabis is not just raising revenue; it\u2019s funding public priorities in nearly every state that regulates adult-use sales. While each state allocates funds differently, MPP\u2019s 2025 report outlines how cannabis taxes are being used to support everything from K\u201312 education and infrastructure to mental health, housing and equity initiatives.\nHere are examples of how legalization states are putting cannabis tax dollars to work:\n- California has directed significant cannabis revenue to childcare, environmental programs, and community reinvestment. In both 2023 and 2024, more than \"$50 million was awarded to community reinvestment grants\" each year.\n- Colorado has allocated more than $934 million to its public school system since legalization. In 2024, the state collected $237.4 million in cannabis taxes, which was \"more than four times the amount of alcohol taxes it collected in 2023.\"\n- Illinois law directs 25% of adult-use cannabis tax revenue to the Recover, Reinvest, and Renew (R3) Program, which funds local organizations in communities harmed by cannabis criminalization. Since legal sales began, more than $380 million has been distributed to this fund.\n- Michigan allocates 35% each to the School Aid Fund and Transportation Fund, and 15% each to municipalities and counties hosting cannabis businesses. In fiscal year 2024, over $116 million went to each of the two state funds, and $99.4 million was distributed locally.\n- Nevada directs \"its entire 10% state retail excise tax to the State Education Fund.\" In FY 2024, cannabis taxes provided $107.8 million to support K\u201312 education.\n- Massachusetts uses cannabis revenue for \"youth programs, public awareness campaigns, and a recently introduced Social Equity Trust Fund,\" which has distributed $26 million to businesses across the state.\n- Arizona earmarks its revenue with precision: 33% to community colleges, 31.6% to law enforcement and fire departments, 25.4% to transportation and 10% to public health and criminal justice programs.\n- Alaska dedicates 50% of cannabis excise taxes to a Recidivism Reduction Fund, supporting reentry services. Another 25% supports the Marijuana Education and Treatment Fund.\n- New York divides its revenue 40% to education, 40% to community reinvestment and 20% to drug treatment and education programs.\n- Maryland allocates 35% of its cannabis tax revenue to a Community Reinvestment and Repair Fund, with additional shares going to business assistance, county governments and public health funds.\n- Vermont directs cannabis taxes to support afterschool and summer programs, especially in underserved areas.\nFrom social equity to school funding, these examples illustrate how legalization is shaping proactive fiscal policy across the country.\nTeen Cannabis Use Has Declined In Most Legal States\nDespite early fears that legalization would increase teen marijuana use, the opposite trend is taking shape. According to the Marijuana Policy Project report, which compiles data from federal and state agencies, \"in 19 of the 21 states with before-and-after data, government surveys indicate a decrease in high schoolers' marijuana use rates post-legalization\".\nThe national data reinforces that trend. Between 2011 and 2024, past-month marijuana use dropped significantly across all three grade levels surveyed by the CDC and Monitoring the Future:\n- 8th grade: from 7.2% to 4.3% (down 40%)\n- 10th grade: from 17.6% to 9.5% (down 46%)\n- 12th grade: from 22.6% to 16.2% (down 28%)\nAccess to marijuana has also declined. Among 10th graders, the share who said cannabis was \"fairly easy\" or \"very easy\" to obtain dropped from 68.4% in 2011 to 41.2% in 2024.\n\u201cSince states began legalizing cannabis for adults in 2012, MTF data shows 28% to 46% drops in past 30-day marijuana use in the three grades it surveyed,\u201d the report notes, \u201calong with significant drops in the percent of youths reporting \u2018very easy\u2019 or \u2018fairly easy\u2019 access to marijuana\u201d.\nState-level data offers a more granular view:\n- Colorado: High school past-month use dropped from 22% in 2011 to 12.8% in 2023\n- Washington (10th grade): from 20.0% in 2010 to 8.4% in 2023\n- California (9th grade): from 12% in 2013\u20132015 to 6% in 2019\u20132021\n- Arizona (10th grade): from 17.0% in 2018 to 7.8% in 2024\n- New York: from 17.9% in 2019 to 12.0% in 2023, excluding NYC data\nThe declines may reflect a shift in who controls access. As the report explains:\n\u201cOn the illegal market, no one is checking IDs before selling marijuana. When and where cannabis is illegal, high schoolers often sell cannabis to their peers\u201d.\nIn contrast, licensed stores \u201chave overwhelming compliance with age-gating,\u201d helping restrict underage access. The report also notes that cannabis taxes are often directed toward \u201ceducation and prevention, such as after-school activities,\u201d reinforcing efforts to reduce youth use.\nThe National Picture Is Sharpening\nAs more states legalize and regulate cannabis for adults, the long-term data is becoming harder to ignore. The feared surge in youth use has not materialized. State tax revenues continue to grow. And cannabis dollars are funding public goods, from education to infrastructure to social equity programs.\nThese aren\u2019t projections. They\u2019re drawn from \u201ctax department reports, federal surveys, and health agency data.\u201d They reveal a steady trend: when states shift cannabis from the illicit market to a regulated one, the result is not chaos: it\u2019s policy alignment.\nWhat began as a bold experiment in Colorado and Washington is now a nationwide case study in how regulation can advance public health and fiscal stability. For lawmakers still debating reform, the numbers offer fewer reasons to delay and more reasons to design legalization thoughtfully, with guardrails and goals."

      "text": "As cannabis becomes a booming global industry, America is stuck on the sidelines. While countries like Canada, Portugal and Colombia ship products around the world, U.S. federal laws block companies from exporting \u2014 and according to new estimates, that delay could be costing up to $10 billion a year in lost trade, jobs and influence.\nNot long ago, I asked whether the U.S. was missing out on the global cannabis boom. The response was overwhelming. Investors, CEOs, policymakers; they all know it\u2019s happening. The question now is whether America can catch up before it's too late.\nThis piece picks up where that conversation left off, zooming in on one missed opportunity that's too big to ignore: cannabis exports.\nAccording to an analysis from Matt Karnes at GreenWave Advisors, the U.S. could be missing out on up to $10 billion a year simply by sitting on the sidelines of global cannabis trade.\nTen. Billion. Dollars.\nThat\u2019s not just market share: that's jobs, tax revenue and influence, slipping away while other countries like Canada, Portugal and Colombia race ahead.\nAnd here's the kicker: cannabis isn\u2019t a niche market anymore. It\u2019s shaping up to be one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing regulated industries, much like alcohol, tobacco and pharma before it.\nThe U.S. once led all three globally. Why should cannabis be any different?\nThe $10 Billion Blindspot\nWhen Karnes crunched the numbers, he wasn\u2019t guessing. He started by looking at how much America already exports in other sectors: wine, beer, tobacco, pharmaceuticals.\n- In pharma, about 18% of U.S. production is exported.\n- In alcohol and tobacco, the figure hovers around 1%.\nFor cannabis, he took the middle ground. Assuming the U.S. market reaches $100 billion at maturity\u2014a widely cited projection\u2014Karnes estimates that even modest export participation could represent at least $10 billion a year.\nYet today, that figure is closer to zero.\nWhy? Federal prohibition. Without national legalization\u2014or at minimum, export-friendly regulations\u2014American cannabis can\u2019t legally leave the country.\nAnd while the U.S. dithers, the world moves on.\nThe Race For Global Cannabis Leadership\nCountries like Canada, Portugal and Colombia aren\u2019t waiting. They\u2019re building cannabis supply chains that look a lot like the early days of global wine, tobacco and pharma trade.\nCanada exported roughly CA$218 million (~$189 million at the time) worth of medical cannabis in the 2023\u201324 fiscal year, a 36% increase from the previous year. What\u2019s more, in the first half of 2024 alone, the country exported 67,475 kilograms of dried medical cannabis flower, nearly doubling the 34,115 kilograms exported during the same period in 2023.\nPortugal shipped 32,558 kilos of medical cannabis abroad in 2024\u2014almost tripling its volume in a single year. Colombia\u2019s exports hit $10.7 million in 2024, according to Colombian tax authority data.\nAnd it's not just these three.\nGermany imports. Australia imports. Israel imports. South Africa, Lesotho, Morocco and Uganda are all scaling up cannabis exports with clear federal frameworks designed to chase global market share.\nMeanwhile, American growers, many sitting on some of the world\u2019s best cannabis genetics and production capacity, can\u2019t even ship products across state lines, let alone to Berlin, Tel Aviv or Sydney.\nAccording to Karnes, \u201cThe potential of a meaningful competitive advantage is at stake\u2014the U.S. has the expertise to dominate the global cannabis industry and if federal law remains status quo, we will be unable to maximize this opportunity.\u201d\nIf you think wine, coffee or tobacco are powerful cultural exports... imagine what California cannabis could have been\u2014and still could be.\nBut every year the U.S. delays, the window narrows.\nWhat America Could Win\u2014If It Acted\nThe U.S. isn\u2019t starting from scratch.\nIt already has the talent, the infrastructure, the brands. California alone has spent more than three decades perfecting genetics, growing techniques and consumer culture that the rest of the world admires\u2014and, let's be honest, wants to buy.\nIf federal export barriers were lifted, the impact could be immediate. Graham Farrar, president of Glass House Brands, one of California\u2019s largest growers, put it plainly: \u201cIf you were to ask 100 people around the world if they wanted cannabis from California or anywhere else, 99 of the 100 will pick California. And for good reason.\u201d\nCalifornia isn\u2019t just a brand: it\u2019s an agricultural force. It dominates global exports in crops like citrus, wine and almonds not because it talks about quality, but because it delivers. Cannabis could easily follow that same path.\nFarrar explains: \u201cThe California market, where cannabis has been legal for nearly 30 years, is the most educated and discerning market on the planet. Everything that makes California a powerhouse in agriculture applies to cannabis.\u201d\nBeyond California, the U.S. could lead in genetics, technology, innovation and branding, fields where American companies already dominate sectors like biotech, and food and beverage.\n\u201cU.S. cannabis is the definition of American exceptionalism,\u201d says Todd Harrison, founding partner at CB1 Capital and author of the Cannabis Confidential newsletter. \u201cBut the longer it takes for the federal bureaucracy to unwind the war on drugs, the more ground we\u2019ll lose to proactive nations like Canada that have already forged international inroads and alliances.\u201d\nAnd the stakes are only rising. \u201cThe race is on,\u201d Harrison adds. \u201cGiven an even playing field\u2014including access to U.S. banks and stock exchanges, and a normalized tax rate\u2014the U.S. would presumably lead the evolution of the global marketplace.\u201d\nAnd yet, he warns, \u201conerous federal regulations continue to punish the pioneers and entrepreneurs that have historically made America great.\u201d\nMore Than Just Money: Influence, Standards And Soft Power\nMissing out on $10 billion in potential exports is bad. But the real cost may be even bigger.\nIn global cannabis, first movers don\u2019t just capture sales: they help write the rules. Countries like Canada, Portugal and Colombia aren\u2019t just exporting flower or oil. They\u2019re exporting GMP-certified processes, setting the bar for lab testing, documentation, traceability and pharma-grade compliance. They\u2019re building relationships with regulators, defining what \u201cquality\u201d means in this industry.\nThe U.S., by contrast, is absent from the negotiating table.\nJulian Wilches, co-founder of Clever Leaves and a key voice in Colombia\u2019s export sector, sees it clearly: \u201cThe United States is late to the race for the global medical cannabis market.\u201d While U.S. operators have focused on fragmented state-level systems, countries like Colombia \u201cdesigned a model oriented toward exports\u201d\u2014built from the ground up with EU-GMP standards and international compliance at its core.\nAnd those early efforts are paying off. In 2024, Colombian cannabis exports reached $10.7 million, according to tax authority DIAN. Clever Leaves, one of the few companies with EU-GMP\u2013certified production in the region, exports to Germany, Australia and Brazil\u2014markets most U.S. companies can\u2019t touch.\n\u201cThe difference,\u201d says Wilches, \u201cis understanding how regulators operate in other countries, what certifications are needed and how to build an international supply chain with pharmaceutical consistency.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not just an operational edge; it\u2019s a soft power advantage. If the U.S. wants a say in how cannabis is regulated, consumed and distributed around the world, it needs to show up with more than brands. It needs infrastructure, standards and legal pathways to participate.\nUntil then, other nations will keep shaping the future. And America will keep watching from the bleachers.\nBuilt For Exports\u2014Or Not\nCountries like Colombia didn\u2019t stumble into the global market. They designed for it. As Wilches explains, \u201cFrom the beginning, Colombia created a regulatory framework that demands traceability, strict sanitary compliance and pharmaceutical-grade quality standards.\u201d That export-first approach, he says, allowed Clever Leaves to become one of the few companies operating at scale under EU-GMP conditions.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. model has remained inward-facing. Operators have mastered the art of navigating 50 different state regulations, but that hasn\u2019t translated into global readiness. \u201cTo compete in global trade,\u201d Wilches adds, \u201cit\u2019s not enough to be efficient locally\u2014you need to understand how foreign regulators work, what certifications are required and how to build a pharmaceutical-grade supply chain at international scale.\u201d\nEven with recent conversations around rescheduling cannabis at the federal level, few in Washington are openly discussing exports. But they should be. Global trade isn\u2019t optional anymore; it\u2019s where the market is heading. And the longer the U.S. waits, the more space it cedes to those who moved first.\nWhat Needs To Change\nIt\u2019s not that the U.S. can\u2019t compete globally\u2014it\u2019s that it\u2019s not allowed to.\nFor American cannabis companies to participate in the global market, the first and most obvious hurdle is federal prohibition. As long as cannabis remains federally illegal, interstate commerce is blocked and exports are off the table.\nKarnes breaks it down: \u201cRemoving barriers to interstate commerce enables the ability to export.\u201d Without it, American companies are stuck playing small ball while the rest of the world opens up.\nThat means the U.S. needs:\n- A federal framework that allows licensed exports.\n- International trade agreements that include cannabis.\n- Regulatory harmonization with importing nations (think EU-GMP).\nAnd maybe most urgently: a tax and compliance system that makes global competition viable. As Karnes puts it, \u201cThe uncertainty around tariffs and excise taxes makes it difficult to estimate potential gains. But even a modest federal tax could unlock 5% of sales in revenue.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just policy\u2014it\u2019s perception. As long as cannabis is treated differently from alcohol, tobacco or pharma, the U.S. will keep forfeiting ground.\nAs Harrison has argued, the federal status quo continues to penalize the very innovators who built the U.S. cannabis industry in the first place.\nUntil federal law changes, U.S. cannabis will remain a local affair in a global economy.\nThe Final Call: Will America Show Up?\nGlobal cannabis is no longer a what-if: it\u2019s a what-now. Countries around the world are setting the rules, signing the trade deals and building the infrastructure to serve billions in future demand. The U.S., despite its legacy of innovation and cultural influence, isn\u2019t just late to the game; it hasn\u2019t even shown up.\nBut it still could.\nWith the right policy changes\u2014interstate commerce, export licenses, regulatory alignment\u2014the U.S. could unlock an entirely new layer of growth. Think Napa Valley, but for cannabis. Think Silicon Valley, but for cannabinoids. The raw material, the know-how, the demand\u2014it\u2019s all there. What\u2019s missing is permission.\nAs Karnes warned, the longer this drags on, the more opportunity we lose. And it\u2019s not theoretical\u2014it\u2019s measurable. Ten billion dollars a year. That\u2019s what federal inaction could be costing us.\nGlobal cannabis trade is moving forward\u2014with or without the U.S. To lead in this emerging market, America will need to shift from local debates to global action.\nBecause while America argues over the finish line, the rest of the world is already in the race."

      "text": "On a shelf between craft beer and kombucha, something else is showing up in more fridges, bar tabs and DoorDash carts: cannabis. Not flower, not gummies: drinks. Fizzy, fruit-forward, sometimes microdosed, sometimes not. Once confined to dispensaries and health stores, THC beverages are moving into everyday life, and fast.\nSome brands promise a cleaner, hangover-free buzz. Others position themselves as functional, plant-based upgrades to wine or cocktails. But whatever the pitch, one thing is clear: cannabis drinks are no longer a novelty. They\u2019re scaling, diversifying and, in some states, outselling more traditional cannabis products like edibles.\nHow Big Is The Cannabis Drinks Industry?\nRetail data from Hoodie Analytics, which tracks licensed cannabis dispensaries, shows a beverage market maturing quickly, especially at the high-dose end. From March 2024 through March 2025, ready-to-drink drinks containing 100 milligrams of THC generated $141 million in U.S. dispensary sales, compared to $20.7 million for 10-milligram drinks and $8 million for 25-milligram formats. Top-selling flavors included lemonade, root beer and orange, with brands like Keef, Uncle Arnie\u2019s and Ray\u2019s Lemonade leading in overall velocity. Notably, these figures do not include hemp-derived beverage sales through general retail channels.\nThe broader global category is growing as well. According to Grandview Research, the THC seltzer market was valued at $344.7 million in 2023 and is projected to surpass $2.6 billion by 2030.\nAmong emerging U.S. players, Br\u0113z, America\u2019s best-selling cannabis drinks brand, reported $28 million in revenue in 2024 and $13 million in the first quarter of 2025, a number that outpaces many longer-established cannabis beverage brands operating solely within licensed dispensary channels.\nYet despite the growth, the industry remains fragmented. Many beverage sales still happen through state-regulated cannabis shops, while others operate under hemp-derived loopholes created by the 2018 Farm Bill. The result is a market with both enormous upside and ongoing legal uncertainty, where measuring \u201chow big\u201d depends heavily on what kind of THC is being tracked and in what regulatory context.\nWhen Did The Cannabis Beverage Boom Really Start?\nThe current wave of cannabis beverages began with the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, which federally legalized hemp and allowed for the sale of products containing less than 0.3% delta-9 THC by dry weight. That legal framework gave rise to a new class of hemp-derived THC drinks that could be sold outside dispensaries, even in states where recreational marijuana remains illegal.\nInnovation in the space began earlier in Canada. Beverage companies like Boston Beer entered the market under full federal legalization, launching products such as TeaPot, a line of 5-milligram THC iced teas. \u201cCannabis drinks were traditionally confined to dispensaries, which can be intimidating and confusing,\u201d says Paul Weaver, head of cannabis at Boston Beer Company, one of the top brewers in the United States. \u201cThe recent proliferation of hemp-derived THC beverages in American liquor stores has validated our hypothesis.\u201d\nIn the U.S., the category\u2019s breakout moment came between 2023 and 2024. As states like Minnesota legalized low-dose THC products for over-the-counter sale, cannabis beverages began appearing in liquor aisles, on retail delivery platforms like DoorDash and through multi-brand DTC sites such as ShopWandererous, launched by Wana Brands to help normalize consumer access.\nWhere Are Cannabis Drinks Gaining Ground?\nCannabis beverages are finding footing well beyond coastal dispensaries. According to Wana Brands, some of the most enthusiastic adoption is happening in Southern and Midwestern states where adult-use cannabis remains illegal.\n\u201cIn emerging markets across the South and Midwest\u2014especially those without adult-use programs\u2014we\u2019re seeing consumers turn to hemp-derived beverages as a legal, approachable alternative to alcohol,\u201d says Stephanie Daley, vice president of supply chain and operations at Wana. \u201cToday\u2019s consumers want control, consistency and transparency in what they consume. Beverages deliver on those expectations in a format that feels familiar.\u201d\nDoorDash, one of the largest last-mile platforms in the U.S., has seen rising demand for hemp-derived THC products delivered directly to consumers.\n\u201cSince 2020, DoorDash has been expanding our offerings beyond restaurant delivery, into categories like grocery, alcohol, retail and more to meet evolving consumer needs and expectations of convenience,\u201d says Tom Carroll, general manager of the hemp category at DoorDash. \u201cWith growing demand for hemp-derived THC and CBD products, we saw a natural opportunity to expand access to a wide selection of products consumers enjoy. Since launching, we\u2019ve continued to see strong and sustained consumer interest in the category, and we\u2019re excited to offer eligible customers a seamless, safe way to get products they want, while helping local merchants reach new consumers.\u201d\nDoorDash data confirms that interest in hemp-derived THC beverages is growing steadily. According to the company, the category is \u201chighly incremental to existing basket sizes\u201d and sees notable demand spikes around major holidays\u2014up 40% on 4/20 compared to the 2025 baseline, with similar increases around July 4. DoorDash also notes that consumers are embracing these drinks as part of their broader retail experience, not just as a novelty.\nMeanwhile, companies like Edibles.com are helping to fill the gap in underserved regions. A new venture from the parent company of Edible Arrangements, Edibles.com is rolling out curated hemp marketplaces in states like Texas, Georgia and Florida, places with high demand and limited access. \u201cWe\u2019re building out a platform that\u2019s all about gifting, food, health and wellness,\u201d CEO Somia Farid Silber told Benzinga. \u201cThis is the wellness part.\u201d\nWhat Types Of Cannabis Drinks Are People Buying?\nDespite the rise of low-dose, lifestyle-oriented drinks, high-potency beverages are still dominating by dollar sales, as evidenced by Hoodie Analytics\u2019 data. These often come in small bottles and, while not designed for sipping, remain popular with heavy consumers.\nBut a shift is underway. At brands like Triple, the goal is to build a beverage portfolio that fits seamlessly into the way consumers already drink.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building Triple to be the next great American beverage brand\u2014not a niche cannabis product,\u201d says Lambo Perkins, the emerging company\u2019s chief marketing officer. \u201cIn a category where most brands lean toward either wellness minimalism or stoner kitsch, Triple sits confidently in the middle: bold, clean and built for the everyday consumer.\u201d\nTriple\u2019s line includes a 3-milligram High Seltzer (designed for sessionability), a 10-milligram High Lemonade and a 5-milligram enhancer called The Drop. \u201cGen Z is redefining what it means to \u2018have a drink,\u2019\u201d Perkins says. \u201cThey want the ritual, but not the calories, the bloat or the hangover.\u201d\nThat shift toward sessionable, lifestyle-oriented drinks began in part with Cann, one of the earliest low-dose THC beverage brands to gain national traction. Backed by celebrity investors and widely credited with introducing the idea of \u201csocial tonics,\u201d Cann helped frame cannabis drinks as a mainstream alternative to beer or hard seltzer. Its model\u20142mg of THC per can\u2014set the tone for a new generation of microdosed products aimed at the wellness-conscious drinker.\nAt Wana, that trend toward intentionality is also evident. \u201cConsumers aren\u2019t chasing trends\u2014they\u2019re searching for solutions,\u201d says Daley. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re starting to see a shift toward functional blends containing other cannabinoids in addition to THC, such as CBD and CBG.\u201d\nEven in curated marketplaces like Edibles.com, which carries fewer than 40 SKUs, drinks remain a consistent part of the offering, often positioned as an approachable entry point for new or wellness-minded consumers. \u201cThis is about offering a safer, more straightforward way for people to try or access THC,\u201d said Edibles.com\u2019s Thomas Winstanley in a recent interview. \u201cEspecially in places where people aren\u2019t sure what\u2019s legal or safe.\u201d\nThe category is also drawing attention from celebrity entrepreneurs and wellness innovators. Snoop Dogg, through his venture Iconic Tonics, has backed a portfolio of cannabis beverages aimed at mainstream social settings. Meanwhile, brands like Adaptaphoria are leaning into mood-enhancing, CBD-based formulations built for relaxation, focus and stress relief, signaling that the future of cannabis drinks may be as much about wellness as it is about the high.\nAre These Drinks Replacing Alcohol Or Reinventing It?\nWhile some cannabis brands present THC beverages as a direct substitute for alcohol, most industry players frame them as something else entirely: a new kind of social ritual. At Boston Beer Company, the approach is additive rather than competitive.\n\u201cCannabis beverages are a nascent category, making it difficult to directly correlate specific cannibalization of our individual brands,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cHowever, the macro-impact on the beverage alcohol category can no longer be ignored.\u201d\nThat shift is already playing out in retail behavior. DoorDash reports that when customers order from alcohol retailers carrying hemp-derived THC products, two-thirds of their basket value comes from hemp, with the remaining third from traditional alcohol. Rather than choosing one or the other, consumers appear to be blending both, mixing microdosed drinks with legacy favorites depending on the occasion.\nTriple\u2019s CMO, Lambo Perkins, sees that pattern in cultural terms. \u201cWe believe Gen Z is mindful, in control and interested in experiences rather than consequences,\u201d she says. \u201cThey still want to sip on something social; they\u2019re just over the hangover, the calories and the bloat.\u201d\nThat generational attitude is reflected in the way cannabis beverages show up in real life: at tailgates, beach days, dinner parties and post-work wind-downs. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving people the same ritual as a beer or cocktail,\u201d says Perkins, \u201cwithout the baggage.\u201d\nFor companies like Wana and Br\u0113z, that also means offering predictable onset and duration, clear labeling and consistent effects\u2014features that align with how alcohol has been regulated and marketed for decades. The difference is the underlying active ingredient and the intent.\nCan This Market Keep Growing?\nBy nearly all measures, yes. California alone saw monthly cannabis beverage sales jump from $2.8 million in March 2024 to over $4 million by March 2025, according to Hoodie Analytics. Brands like Ray\u2019s Lemonade and Ayrloom continue to lead in velocity, while smaller players like Sips and Soganja are also gaining ground.\nOn the national scale, mainstream alcohol retailers like Total Wine & More and ABC Fine Wine & Spirits are expanding their hemp-derived offerings. \u201cWe believe there\u2019s growing interest among our alcohol partners in expanding their DoorDash offerings to include hemp-derived THC and CBD,\u201d a company spokesperson confirms.\nAt the same time, operators are bracing for increased regulatory scrutiny, as Congress debates a new Farm Bill that could redefine the legal boundaries for hemp-derived THC\u2014and as multiple states consider outright bans. Rather than resist the shift, many in the industry are actively pushing for smarter, more consistent oversight.\n\u201cWe have no interest in a wild west approach,\u201d says Triple COO Will Spartin, who also sits on the board of the Hemp Beverage Alliance. \u201cWe are advocating for positive regulation that balances between a free market approach and the need to protect consumer safety.\u201d\nThat sentiment is echoed by leaders at Edibles.com, who see responsible retail and clear milligram caps as essential for the category\u2019s survival. \u201cRegulation in this category can be a net positive,\u201d Winstanley said. \u201cIt helps weed out bad actors. It legitimizes good ones. And it creates a safer space for the consumer.\u201d\nStill, the future of cannabis beverages will depend as much on cultural integration as it does on legal frameworks. As Wana\u2019s Daley puts it, \u201cWe\u2019re moving past the \u2018can you believe this has THC?\u2019 moment and into \u2018where does this fit in my life?\u2019\u201d\nFor now, the answer seems to be: on the shelf, in the cart and increasingly, in the fridge.\nThe Bottom Line\nAs federal clarity lags and state laws shift in real time, cannabis drinks continue to evolve from curiosity to category. What was once a niche product sold in dispensaries is now a growing segment in liquor stores, delivery apps and mainstream retail\u2014offering consumers a new way to relax, reconnect or simply replace a drink.\nWhether they\u2019re seen as a threat to alcohol, a wellness tool or just a better-tasting gummy, one thing is certain: cannabis beverages aren\u2019t going away. They\u2019re just getting started."

      "text": "As cannabis becomes a regulated global commodity\u2014spanning pharma, exports and healthcare\u2014the U.S. risks falling behind. While other regions advance structured markets, federal inaction and investor hesitation threaten America\u2019s role in the industry it once led.\nCall it what you want\u2014emerging, evolving, exploding\u2014the global cannabis market is no longer a curiosity.\nWith more than 100 countries adopting some form of legalization and cross-border shipments rising each quarter, cannabis is becoming a regulated international commodity. New projections from Whitney Economics estimate that the total addressable market for medical and adult-use cannabis could reach \u20ac429 billion (~$483 billion), with upside to \u20ac448 billion.\nAnd that\u2019s just the THC side of the equation. Whitney\u2019s models also show that hemp, used in everything from textiles and cosmetics to concrete and automotive parts, has a potential global market of $456 billion.\nSo while federal prohibition keeps the United States stuck in legal purgatory, cannabis is scaling across continents, becoming pharmaceutical, industrial and increasingly normalized.\nConsider just a few milestones:\n- Germany imported more than 72 metric tons of medical cannabis in 2024\u201431 tons in Q4 alone.\n- Colombia exported over $11 million worth of cannabis to Europe, Australia and Israel.\n- Israel is projected to reach 242,000 registered medical cannabis patients by 2027.\n- Lesotho, Morocco and South Africa are all rolling out export-driven cannabis strategies.\n- Meanwhile, the U.S. market, valued at $31.4 billion, remains locked in a state-by-state mess, federally illegal and fragmented.\nAs the rest of the world ramps up, American investors mostly watch from the sidelines\u2014cautious, burned and unsure how (or if) they should engage. But if this caution continues, it may soon turn into something much more costly: irrelevance.\nEurope\u2019s Steady Hand\nWhile the U.S. built its market around buzzwords and billboards, Europe quietly built infrastructure. Its model is slower, stricter and shaped by healthcare\u2014not hype.\n\u201cThe irony of the U.S. reticence to enter Europe is there are real opportunities with real operators making real money,\u201d says Jamie Pearson, CEO of New Holland Group, a global advisory firm that helps cannabis companies expand into European and international markets. \u201cGreat deals with fair terms and excellent teams attract money effortlessly. The solution is getting the deal pitched to the right investors at the right time. Timing plays a huge role.\u201d\nAnd that window may already be narrowing. \u201cWe are living in uncertain times and investors are hoarding cash,\u201d Pearson adds. \u201cU.S. investors have lost big in the sector and are understandably gun-shy. Mistakes were expensive \u2014 and many were just bad timing and bad luck with regulators.\u201d\nGlobally, innovation is booming. Just not in the U.S. (or at least, not where it matters most). \u201cSome of the biggest tech and research innovations have come out of Asia and Israel, for example,\u201d Pearson notes. \u201cThe U.S.\u2019 Schedule 1 draconian laws make research and innovation nearly impossible unless you\u2019re talking about ancillary products like hardware or packaging.\u201d\nIn contrast, Europe\u2019s cannabis infrastructure is deeply tied to its healthcare systems: prescriptions, pharmacies, insurance coverage and lab testing. And nowhere is that more evident than in Germany.\nIvan Garev, founder and CEO of Drapalin Pharmaceuticals, a Germany-based manufacturer and distributor of EU-GMP\u2013certified medical cannabis, describes a system rooted in patient care. \u201cThe full therapeutic potential of medical cannabis is still far from being realized. The ability to prescribe under medical supervision remains essential.\u201d He highlights the removal of prior authorization for specialist prescriptions under public insurance as \u201ca major breakthrough\u201d that \u201csignificantly improved patient care.\u201d\nWhile cannabis clubs are now being introduced, Garev emphasizes that \u201cpatient access through pharmacies and insurance remains the cornerstone.\u201d In his view, \u201cinsurance coverage and medical supervision aren\u2019t optional \u2014 they\u2019re what make the German model resilient and safe.\u201d Still, he warns, \u201cGermany has reset the course \u2014 but the journey is far from over.\u201d\nChris Day, co-founder of the Global Cannabis Network Collective, which connects cannabis executives across more than 40 countries, sees that evolution as crucial: \u201cEurope, while pragmatic and smaller at the moment, has the most elements necessary \u2014 capital, banking, regulations that can be followed and are being adapted over time \u2014 to foster successful long-term growth.\u201d\nEconomist Beau Whitney backs it up with data: more than 115 countries now allow some form of legal cannabis access. In the U.S., he says, \u201cthe bifurcation of hemp versus higher THC cannabis has created externalities\u2026 confusing consumers and investors alike.\u201d Europe, by contrast, regulates cannabis based on product intention, not arbitrary THC thresholds.\nWhitney\u2019s formula is clear as day: \u201cU.S. = high risk, low return. EU = slow growth, lower risk, greater predictability.\u201d\nLatin America\u2019s Reset\u2014And Brazil\u2019s Role\nIf Europe is defined by structure, Latin America is defined by untapped potential. The region has every natural advantage\u2014sun, land, labor and local demand\u2014but still struggles to convert it into consistent exports or domestic access.\nChris Day recalls how early Canadian overinvestment gave the region whiplash. \u201cThose players pulled out and crashed much of the market through their hubris. That stigma continues to linger.\u201d\nColombia is slowly shedding that past. Its exports are increasing and companies are refining product quality, consistency and traceability. It is also said that domestic flower sales (currently prohibited) could soon be allowed. Peru is progressing toward broader reform. But barriers remain.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t generalize Latin America,\u201d says Lucas Nosiglia, a veteran of the region with years of operational experience. \u201cThe opportunity depends on achieving volumes that allow for economies of scale.\u201d He adds that both the U.S. and Europe could become viable markets\u2014if Latin America can meet their regulatory and pharma expectations.\nBrazil, the region\u2019s largest economy, is showing both promise and limitations. According to BLAZ, the Brazilian medical cannabis market surpassed R$853 million (~$140 million) in 2023 and is projected to exceed R$1 billion by 2025. Patient counts reached an estimated 672,000 last year\u2014a 56% jump from 2023\u2014making Brazil one of the most active medical cannabis markets in the world.\nYet, nearly half of all cannabis-based medicinal products are still imported and flower remains off the table entirely. \u201cFlower is a real, inescapable demand embedded in Latin American culture,\u201d says Nosiglia. \u201cInstead of trying to ban it, countries should build models that educate and regulate it\u2014with traceability, physician guidance and standards.\u201d\nRecent court rulings have opened the door for hemp cultivation and the import of seeds, and new regulations from ANVISA, the local regulator, are expected soon\u2014steps that could help local production finally catch up with demand.\nHe points to Argentina\u2019s REPROCANN as an example of a more culturally responsive approach. Though new registrations are now on pause, the program allows patients access to medical flower through prescriptions\u2014bridging the gap between pharma and lived experience. \u201cIt laid the groundwork for a system built on evidence and access,\u201d he says.\nFormer Argentine congressman and cannabis entrepreneur Facundo Garret\u00f3n, founder and CEO of holding company Terraflos, agrees\u2014and sees the opportunity widening.\n\u201cLatin America is well\u2011positioned to become a major hub for cannabis\u2011derived pharmaceutical ingredients, yet much of its potential remains underutilized,\u201d he explains. \u201cColombia has benefited from being an early mover in establishing a robust regulatory framework for cultivation and production \u2014 positioning itself ahead on the learning curve. This has allowed the country to become a key supplier not only to highly regulated markets like Brazil and Australia, but also to countries with emerging frameworks and limited local manufacturing capacity, such as Argentina and Peru.\u201d\nHe sees the next competitive advantage in execution. \u201cThe challenge is no longer just agronomic\u2014it\u2019s about bridging regulatory gaps, building trust in product quality and proving consistency in delivery.\u201d\nOther markets are quietly advancing, too. Mexico, despite delays in adult-use regulation, remains one of the largest potential markets in the world. Paraguay, already a regional exporter of medical cannabis, has seen growing political debate around full legalization\u2014with whispers of an adult-use bill gaining traction in 2025. As global demand rises, Latin America\u2019s next breakthrough may come from unexpected corners.\nIsrael, Asia And The Innovation Gap\nWhile others scale fields, Israel is scaling labs.\nThe country\u2019s medical cannabis framework, active since the 1990s, combines clinical trials, academic research and industry collaboration. It\u2019s a model built for data, not just dollars.\nAs of 2017, the country had more than 110 clinical trials involving cannabis underway, according to Michael Dor, a senior medical adviser at the Israeli Health Ministry. What\u2019s more, between 2010 and 2023, Israel accounted for approximately 6.8% of all cannabis-related clinical trials globally, ranking fourth after the U.S., U.K. and Canada. With the market projected to reach over $300 million in revenue by 2025, the country continues to invest in robust cannabis research, positioning itself as a global leader in clinical innovation.\nElsewhere in Asia, R&D is picking up momentum. Thailand has leaned into cannabis science through state-supported projects and universities. South Korea, though tightly regulated, allows limited medical access and is supporting cannabinoid research for rare diseases. Even China\u2014despite strict bans on consumption\u2014is home to a growing hemp industry and early-stage cannabinoid biotech tied to CBD extraction. In fact, China\u2019s industrial hemp market was valued at $970.12 million in 2023, it is anticipated to reach $6.7 billion by 2032, driven by rising demand for sustainable and eco-friendly products across various industries\nMeanwhile, U.S. researchers, who technically lead in the number of cannabis-related clinical trials, mostly remain limited in scope due to federal restrictions. With cannabis still classified as a Schedule I drug, researchers face complex approval processes, limited access to quality study materials and funding barriers. As a result, countries like Israel, where cannabis research is supported by coordinated national policy, continue to produce more impactful, streamlined clinical insights.\nGermany: Adult-Use, But Not Like You Think\nYes, Germans can now carry up to 25 grams, grow three plants at home and join cannabis clubs. But this isn\u2019t California 2.0. There\u2019s no retail blitz, no green rush. Just pilot programs, phased rollouts, and regulation-heavy experimentation.\nPearson sees the nuance: \u201cGermany took cannabis off the narcotics list and that has been a game changer.\u201d\nBehind the headlines, the system remains deeply medical. Cannabis is prescribed via telemedicine, filled at pharmacies and reimbursed by insurance\u2014a stark contrast to the out-of-pocket, dispensary-driven model in the U.S.\nIn a podcast interview, Sanity Group\u2019s Finn H\u00e4nsel noted that fewer than 1% of cannabis users in Germany have accessed the legal system, a figure that underscores how vast the unregulated market remains.\nGermany has an estimated 8.5 million cannabis users, but only a fraction have transitioned into legal channels. If even a small percentage converts to the formal system, the market could see explosive growth\u2014without the chaos that often follows unregulated commercialization.\nThat\u2019s the bet Germany is making: a slower, more structured approach focused on public health, safety and patient access first. For policymakers in other countries, it\u2019s a model worth watching.\nMeanwhile, legacy cannabis capitals like the Netherlands and Spain are undergoing transformations of their own. In late 2023 and early 2024, the Netherlands launched a long-awaited pilot program to legalize cannabis production and sales in select municipalities\u2014moving beyond decades of tolerated but technically illegal coffeeshop culture. In contrast, Barcelona, once a hotspot for cannabis social clubs, has seen increased regulatory pushback, casting uncertainty over the legal status of its hundreds of private associations. Both cases highlight the growing pressure across Europe to shift from informal tolerance to structured, accountable systems\u2014something Germany\u2019s model is now aiming to formalize.\nA Pharmaceutical Model With Continental Scale\nOne of Europe\u2019s strongest long-term assets is its alignment with pharma.\nEU-GMP certification is the standard. Doctors write prescriptions. Insurance picks up the tab. Cannabis is dispensed alongside antibiotics and insulin, not next to energy drinks and vape cartridges.\nThis model may lack the flashy appeal of big-brand dispensaries, but it\u2019s built for endurance. Consistent oversight, medical infrastructure and cross-border trade potential offer investors the kind of predictability the U.S. still struggles to match.\nMeanwhile, U.S. patients remain stuck in a costly, disconnected patchwork of state-by-state rules with no insurance coverage in sight.\nStill, not everyone agrees Europe\u2019s pharma-first path is working across the board. Rub\u00e9n Valenzuela, CTO of Valenveras\u2014a Spanish firm that develops portable cannabis analysis tools and co-organizer of the C-Days cannabis science summit\u2014warns that excessive bureaucracy is choking progress in key markets like Spain.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s missing in Europe for a real medical cannabis market is clear regulation that allows markets to operate,\u201d he explains. \u201cCurrent production challenges around medical channels and EU-GMP\u2014especially through agencies like the AEMPS in Spain\u2014stem from excessive bureaucracy imposed by government agencies, making them less competitive globally.\u201d\nValenzuela adds that this rigidity may not be accidental. \u201cWithout a doubt, the European pharmaceutical model and its lobbying forces are pushing for regulation to be shaped in a way they can control and ultimately benefit from.\u201d\nAfrica\u2019s Quiet Surge\nAfrica may be the least discussed, but it\u2019s not far behind. Lesotho was first to legalize medical cannabis exports. Morocco has approved cultivation for medical and industrial use and South Africa is expanding both domestic frameworks and international pipelines.\nChris Day puts it clearly: \u201cThe longer-term threat to the Latin American market will be Africa as a more natural European trade partner for agriculture.\u201d Cheaper labor, closer geography and increasing political will could make African nations the suppliers of choice for Europe\u2019s growing demand.\nThat demand is real. As EU nations ramp up imports and require EU-GMP\u2013certified product, several African governments are designing policies explicitly aligned with export markets. Ghana and Uganda, for example, have passed laws that prioritize medical cannabis cultivation and overseas sales, bypassing recreational debates altogether.\nPeter-John Pywell, CEO of South Africa\u2013based Uncle Rooneys, says the continent\u2019s future hinges on building trust, not chasing volume.\n\u201cAs global cannabis markets evolve, volatility has become a key challenge \u2014 from fluctuating demand to oversupply,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the biggest disruptions has come from Canada, where an unchecked boom has led to the global dumping of cheap, low-quality cannabis. While this may serve short-term needs, it damages trust and undermines the industry\u2019s credibility.\u201d\nPywell believes Africa offers a different story: \u201cSouth Africa, a nation built on generations of farming excellence \u2014 from citrus and wine to rooibos and maize \u2014 is now applying that same care and precision to cannabis. With ideal growing conditions, competitive costs and proven export experience, Africa is uniquely positioned to become a reliable global supplier.\u201d\nHe adds that with Germany\u2019s cannabis reform raising the bar on compliance, quality will matter more than price. \u201cWe\u2019re not chasing trends, we\u2019re building a future rooted in consistency, quality and community upliftment.\u201d\nAs the cannabis industry matures, Pywell says, \u201cAfrica won\u2019t just participate; we\u2019ll lead.\u201d\nThe U.S. Can Lead\u2014If It Decides To\nGermany\u2019s reforms. Colombia\u2019s exports. Israel\u2019s research. Africa\u2019s readiness. Asia\u2019s innovation.\nThe global cannabis boom isn\u2019t hypothetical; it\u2019s happening. And the U.S.\u2014still the world\u2019s largest consumer market\u2014is being outpaced in everything but hype, retail sales and public company listings.\n\u201cSo much of all of this hinges on raising the level of maturity and understanding of global economics within the industry itself,\u201d says Day. Investors need better science, better context and better global vision.\nPearson agrees: \u201cEach company expands to Europe for different reasons\u2026 your best decision is to get boots-on-the-ground expertise\u2026 to avoid unnecessary and expensive and avoidable mistakes.\u201d\nThere\u2019s still time to catch the wave. But the rest of the world isn\u2019t waiting."

This is the report on what happened.\nPor: Isabel Pereira Arana | March 18, 2025\nIn the final hours of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) on March 14, we were on the edge of our seats, anxiously waiting. After a tense week of negotiations, Colombia was on the verge of a historic breakthrough\u2014securing the approval of an unprecedented resolution in a space where consensus is the norm, and any attempt at change faces a wall of resistance. The outcome was uncertain, and the decision would be made in a matter of minutes.\nThe Resolution That Shook Vienna\nLike the Conferences of the Parties (COP), the CND negotiates resolutions\u2014documents that outline the commitments countries agree to uphold under international treaties. In this session, for the first time ever, Colombia was leading a resolution. And it wasn\u2019t just any resolution: it called for an independent, external review of the implementation of drug treaties. In other words, it put prohibition itself under scrutiny to assess its real effectiveness.\nColombia pushed for this review knowing full well that, by its own measures, the drug control system has been a costly failure: today, there are more drugs, they are more potent, and the profits from illegality have only strengthened organized crime. Under the guise of eradicating drugs, brutal campaigns of extrajudicial executions have taken place, like those in the Philippines, where thousands were murdered by government-backed death squads aiming to \u201ccleanse\u201d cities of drugs and the people who use them. In fact, as the CND sessions unfolded, the International Criminal Court announced the arrest of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte for crimes against humanity committed in his country\u2019s drug war.\nA Debate Stuck in the Past\nColombia\u2019s proposal was a direct challenge to the traditional structure of the CND. Every March, negotiations in these halls focus on maintaining the status quo. Resolutions passed year after year reaffirm commitment to international drug treaties while avoiding any mention of human rights or the harmful consequences of the system at both national and global levels. Additionally, these resolutions are adopted by consensus, following the so-called \u201cVienna spirit,\u201d which has historically avoided voting altogether.\nThis tradition was dangerous: consensus always reduced progress to the lowest possible level, as it sought to reconcile extreme and opposing views on drug policy. In this context, Colombia\u2019s resolution was not only a shake-up of the usual process but also set the stage for something unusual\u2014an actual vote, with an uncertain outcome.\nThe U.S.: A Minority Voice\nThe week made it clear that passing the resolution would not be easy\u2014not for Colombia, nor for any other proposal. From day one, the United States adopted a combative stance, determined to block any progress by objecting to references to \u201csustainable development,\u201d \u201cgender,\u201d \u201cLGBTI,\u201d \u201cbiodiversity,\u201d and more. Even seemingly uncontroversial resolutions, like Chile\u2019s on drug use prevention or the one from Germany, Thailand, and Peru on alternative development for rural communities, faced strong resistance.\nIt was clear that we were in uncharted territory. While the U.S. had never pushed for a reform agenda, it had also never opposed the fundamental frameworks of the United Nations so aggressively\u2014challenging even the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This was a stark contrast to the U.S. position under Biden just a year earlier when it had led efforts to incorporate harm reduction policies into global drug strategies, alongside Colombia. That initiative resulted in the first vote on a resolution in the CND in decades\u2014a vote that passed with 38 in favor, 2 against, 6 abstentions, and 7 absences.\nA Historic Vote\nFast forward to 2025. On Thursday night, after days of strong opposition to Colombia\u2019s resolution, the U.S. introduced an amendment\u2014promptly countered by one from Colombia. The Friday plenary session consumed valuable time just deciding the order in which the amendments would be voted on. By then, all other resolutions had already been adopted\u2014none by consensus. In every case, it was the U.S. that had called for a vote, arguing:\n\u201cWe have decided to call a vote because this resolution reaffirms the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. These promote a weak global governance model that is incompatible with U.S. sovereignty and citizens\u2019 rights. We reject the SDGs and will not reaffirm them. The resolution also fails to acknowledge the reality that there are only two sexes: male and female.\u201d\nDespite leading the push for votes, the U.S. found itself isolated, joined only by Argentina and Russia.\nWhen the vote on the Expert Panel finally took place, the pattern held. The resolution was adopted with 30 votes in favor and 3 against (United States, Russia, and Argentina).\nThe resolution, titled \u201cStrengthening the international drug control system: a path to effective implementation\u201d, is just the beginning of a process. What comes next? The establishment of an Independent Expert Panel tasked with developing a set of recommendations to enhance treaty implementation. The panel will consist of 19 members: ten appointed by the CND\u2019s regional groups, five by the UN Secretary-General, three by the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), and one by the World Health Organization (WHO). Updates on this process will be presented at the CND\u2019s 69th and 70th sessions, in 2026 and 2027.\nIn the words of Ambassador Laura Gil:\n\u201cColombia supplies less than 5% of the illegal drug market. We are not proud of this reality, but why does every Colombian feel like the world\u2019s drug problem rests on their shoulders? This panel is an invitation, within the framework of the conventions, to rethink our approach\u2014to truly embrace the principle of shared responsibility. My country has sacrificed more lives than any other in the drug war imposed on us. We have postponed our development, dedicating our best men and women and a large share of our national budget to fighting illicit trafficking. We want new, more effective ways to implement the global regime. This should not be a confrontation among us, the CND members, but rather a reflection of our commitment to combat transnational crime.\u201d\nIt is promising that the panel will include experts from outside Vienna. Much of the stagnation in the global drug policy debate stems from how closed-off this space is to insights from other UN agencies with expertise in public health, HIV, peace, security, sustainable development, and gender, among others. This process opens the door for an external review of the system\u2014one where it is no longer both judge and jury.\nHowever, concerns remain. The panel\u2019s mandate is restricted to the framework of treaty obligations, yet the stated goal of \u201celiminating the drug supply\u201d is not only unattainable but also undesirable.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nTo ensure real progress, it will be crucial to secure diverse funding sources for the panel, with contributions from states that ensure a regional balance of perspectives and expertise. Additionally, the expert selection process must be transparent and allow for meaningful participation from civil society and affected communities.\nAfter years of stagnation, in which the CND risked becoming an obsolete and irrelevant space due to its rigid consensus-driven approach, Colombia\u2019s initiative breathes new life into the Commission. It opens a historic opportunity to forge real change."

      "text": "Some call New York the most inclusive cannabis market in America for Latino entrepreneurs. But behind the licenses and headlines, the reality is more complex.\nNew York legalized adult-use cannabis in 2021 with a bold proposition: put the people harmed by prohibition at the center of legalization. Prioritize justice-involved entrepreneurs. Make equity a target with teeth, not a tagline. For many Latino operators, that ambition translated into reality.\nIn neighborhoods like Astoria, Dyckman and Bed-Stuy, Latino-owned dispensaries are now open for business. Entrepreneurs with lived experience\u2014formerly incarcerated, legacy veterans, community builders\u2014are staking their claim in the regulated market. Sometimes in the same zip codes where the plant once got them arrested.\nBut is New York really the most inclusive cannabis market in the country? And what does inclusion mean once the confetti settles and the leases are signed?\nTo find out, I spoke with Latino cannabis entrepreneurs from across the city. Most received Conditional Adult-Use Retail Dispensary (CAURD) licenses. Their reflections reveal a nuanced picture: the blueprint is solid, but execution remains fraught.\nLatina Entrepreneurs Still Face Higher Barriers\nWhile several Latino-owned dispensaries have opened across the city, Latina ownership remains far less visible.\nMama Verde, co-founded by Christina Arez and Krystel Bloomfield, was awarded a CAURD license but has yet to open. Other efforts, like the dispensary licensed to Fernando Pe\u00f1a and Suzanne Furboter, have also faced delays. The scarcity of Latina-operated stores underscores the deeper challenges around capital, stigma and access still facing women of color in the industry.\nStill, a few Latina entrepreneurs are actively shaping New York\u2019s cannabis and accessories market. Elyssa Colon, a Puerto Rican Bronx native and co-founder of HighGarden NYC, blends hospitality and community leadership to create inclusive, women-led cannabis events and services. Kristina Lopez Adduci, founder of House of Puff, leads a Latina-owned brand focused on art-inspired accessories, bilingual education and stigma reduction, reimagining the cannabis experience for women and Latinos alike.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just running businesses,\u201d said Miguel Brito, founder of The 1 Brand, in an exclusive interview. \u201cWe\u2019re rewriting the narrative.\u201d\nNew York\u2019s Equity Promise\nWhen the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act (MRTA) passed in 2021, it set a new tone. The law set a goal for 50% of adult-use cannabis licenses to go to social and economic equity applicants, including people from communities disproportionately impacted by cannabis enforcement, minority- and women-owned businesses, distressed farmers and service-disabled veterans.\nSoon after, the Office of Cannabis Management rolled out the Conditional Adult-Use Retail Dispensary program. CAURD prioritized New Yorkers impacted by cannabis-related convictions, making them the first allowed to open licensed dispensaries.\nBy the end of 2024, state data showed 315 provisional CAURD licenses had been issued. Over half went to individuals from Black and Latino communities.\nBut equity in licensing doesn\u2019t always translate to representation across the industry. The same report noted that just 15% of workers in New York\u2019s cannabis supply chain identified as Hispanic or Latino, compared to 18% of the state\u2019s overall workforce.\n\u201cNew York made equity a priority,\u201d Brito said. \u201cBut real inclusion means more than licenses.\u201d\nThe Legacy That Helped Shape New York\u2019s Equity Push\nAny conversation about Latino leadership in New York\u2019s cannabis market would be incomplete without Happy Munkey, the brand co-founded by Vladimir Bautista, from Harlem, and Ramon Reyes, from Washington Heights. Long before CAURD licenses existed, Happy Munkey was a movement. Part underground lounge, part media collective, part cultural catalyst.\nAs Bautista put it: \u201cIn New York, Latinos are succeeding. We\u2019re owners of our own future. We\u2019re raising the Latino flag high and proud.\u201d\nThe pair built a cannabis lifestyle brand that celebrated the plant openly while pushing for its legalization. Through podcasts, videos and public events, Happy Munkey became a beacon for the city\u2019s legacy cannabis community. In 2024, they opened licensed dispensaries in both Dyckman and downtown Brooklyn, transforming years of grassroots organizing into fully legal retail operations.\nHappy Munkey\u2019s influence helped lay the foundation for the equity push that followed. Bautista and Reyes were among the first to prove that legacy-to-legal transitions were not only possible but essential to meaningful reform. In 2024, they were named to Forbes' Cannabis 4:20 list, joining other trailblazers reshaping the industry from its foundations.\nOn The Ground: Latino Entrepreneurs Building Against The Odds\nAcross the five boroughs, Latino cannabis operators are shaping the market in real time.\nJeremy Rivera, a Puerto Rican entrepreneur and former justice-involved individual, co-founded Terp Bros in Astoria. Raised in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Rivera experienced incarceration for non-violent drug offenses. He now leads the Cannabis Retail Alliance of New York (CRANY) and advocates for equity across the state.\n\u201cI grew up in a system that criminalized people who looked like me for the very same plant I now legally sell,\u201d he said. \u201cOpening my doors, in my neighborhood, as a licensed owner\u2014that\u2019s powerful.\u201d\nRivera was among the first to open under CAURD. He believes the program created opportunity, but the path remains steep.\n\u201cThe state gave people like me a real shot,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Section 280E taxes [the federal rule that blocks cannabis businesses from deducting standard expenses] plus stigma in our own communities and the lack of funding make survival tough.\u201d\nMiguel Brito, a Dominican-American entrepreneur and founder of The 1 Brand, blends legacy experience with modern innovation. He built his career across cultivation, processing and compliance, and developed DabGo, a portable dab rig. He now operates in both New York and New Jersey.\n\u201cEquity isn\u2019t about getting mentioned in press releases,\u201d Brito said. \u201cIt\u2019s about staying open.\u201d\nAlexander Norman, who spent years operating an unlicensed cannabis delivery service in New York, co-founded Budega NYC in Brooklyn. A Cuban-American entrepreneur, Norman transitioned from the legacy market into licensed retail through the CAURD program.\n\u201cNew York has more Latino licensees than any other adult-use state,\u201d he said. \u201cBut without capital and solid business support, many of us could still get pushed out.\u201d\n\u201cPersonally, it\u2019s validated my legacy experience and pursuit,\u201d Norman added. \u201cProfessionally, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve proven much yet\u2014other than that I can open a licensed dispensary. The jury\u2019s still out on whether it will succeed.\u201d\nLouis W. Col\u00f3n III, a Puerto Rican entrepreneur with a deep background in fashion and branding, co-founded Budega NYC. He previously held senior roles at FILA, Footlocker and Extra Butter, and now applies his design ethos to creating a dispensary experience rooted in Latino culture and pride.\n\u201cIt means the world to build something our people connect to,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen someone walks into Budega and sees themselves reflected, it matters.\u201d\nOther Latino-led cannabis businesses, such as Glenna & Co, Polanco Brothers and Con Bud, are also helping shape New York\u2019s evolving dispensary scene, adding to the momentum sparked by early equity pioneers.\n\u201cGiving the next generation an example of what work, creativity, respect, opportunity and community can build\u2014that\u2019s what drives us,\u201d Col\u00f3n added.\nWhat Other States Tried\u2014And Why New York Stands Out\nWhile New York\u2019s rollout had flaws, many operators say it still leads the country in Latino inclusion.\nMassachusetts saw modest progress. According to Rivera, roughly 15% of its social equity program participants are Latino. But access to capital and zoning headaches persist.\nIn California, despite having the nation\u2019s largest Latino population, representation in cannabis remains minimal.\n\u201cThere are advocacy groups and some local programs,\u201d Brito said. \u201cBut actual support\u2014funding, mentorship, ownership\u2014is still lacking.\u201d\nNew Jersey and Illinois built equity into their laws, but results have been inconsistent. Delays, legal challenges and unclear implementation have kept many out.\n\u201cSome states made good promises,\u201d Brito said. \u201cNew York actually started handing over keys.\u201d\n\u201cReal inclusion requires more than good intentions,\u201d Brito added. \u201cIt needs funding, mentorship and accountability.\u201d\nWhere The System Still Breaks\nAll the entrepreneurs interviewed pointed to a common truth: getting a license was just the beginning.\nCapital remains the biggest hurdle. Many CAURD operators entered the market without private investors or traditional banking relationships.\n\u201cWe self-funded Budega,\u201d Col\u00f3n said. \u201cIf more public programs helped cover buildouts or rent, fewer people would end up in bad loan deals.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s Section 280E, the federal tax law that prohibits cannabis businesses from deducting ordinary expenses.\n\u201cFor Latino entrepreneurs, especially those without cash reserves, 280E is a killer,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cYou\u2019re taxed on revenue, not profit.\u201d\nRegulatory confusion only adds to the pressure. The compliance burden, zoning restrictions and shifting rules stretch already thin resources.\nCristina Aranguiz, a Cuban-American cannabis operator who built a multi-state business without outside capital, echoed that sentiment. \u201cLicensing fees and start-up costs in cannabis can easily run into the hundreds of thousands or millions, and undercapitalized entrepreneurs, many of whom are Latino, struggle to compete,\u201d she said in an interview a few months ago. \u201cAt the same time, stigma around \u2018drugs\u2019 within some communities discourages talented professionals from entering the industry in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cEquity doesn\u2019t mean surviving on fumes,\u201d Brito continued. \u201cIt means being given the tools to compete.\u201d\nAnd finally, several operators raised the issue of cultural stigma\u2014a quiet force still keeping some Latinos out of the industry.\n\u201cWe need more education, outreach, and community conversations to shift how cannabis is viewed; not just as a substance, but as a legitimate business and opportunity for economic empowerment,\u201d Rivera said.\nWhen Equity Falls Short: The CAURD Inc. Rebellion\nFor many Conditional Adult-Use Retail Dispensary (CAURD) licensees, New York\u2019s equity experiment has yielded not opportunity but debt.\n\u201cEquity isn\u2019t just about who gets the license. It\u2019s about what comes next,\u201d said Alex Ortecho, interim president of the Cannabis Association for Unified Retail Development (CAURD Inc.) and owner of Bronx Joint. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the infrastructure to back up your promises\u2014capital, property access, legal protections\u2014then your program isn\u2019t equitable, it\u2019s just symbolic.\u201d\nFormed in 2024 by a cohort of CAURD licensees, CAURD Inc. emerged as a response to widespread frustration with New York\u2019s equity rollout, particularly the state-backed DASNY Social Equity Cannabis Investment Fund. Instead of offering the promised low-cost capital and turnkey locations, the program imposed inflated buildout costs, opaque billing and inflexible leases on licensees, according to the group.\n\u201cDASNY turned into a cautionary tale\u2014an equity model built without market knowledge, cost controls or community voice,\u201d said Dasheeda Dawson, a spokesperson for CAURD Inc. and the former founding director of Cannabis NYC. \u201cInstead of lifting licensees, it boxed them in.\u201d\nDawson described how licensees were saddled with over $1 million in buildout costs per store, sometimes for spaces valued far less, and faced rent and fees exceeding $30,000 per month, often without clear justification. \u201cThe state failed to deliver on its promise to incubate businesses,\u201d she said. \u201cIt merely licensed them and left them to sink or swim.\u201d\nThe group has since outlined a bold recovery agenda: full loan forgiveness for DASNY-tied stores, real technical assistance for justice-involved entrepreneurs, flexible capital access, and a transparent, community-led oversight process. Without such reforms, Dawson warned, \u201cNew York risks permanently damaging the credibility and purpose of its equity-driven framework.\u201d\nWhy This Matters Now\nThe presence of Latino-owned dispensaries in New York is a signal. It shows that equity policy, when backed by intention, can work.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here to be a case study,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to build legacies.\u201d\nFrom the bilingual service counters to the locally hired staff, these entrepreneurs are shaping a new kind of cannabis economy. One that reflects the neighborhoods it serves.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for favors,\u201d Brito added. \u201cWe\u2019re asking for infrastructure. Equity is a process, not a pitch.\u201d\nThey aren\u2019t just surviving; they\u2019re fighting to thrive\u2014sometimes quietly, sometimes loudly, always with purpose.\nTheir storefronts aren\u2019t symbols. They\u2019re systems. And if New York can sustain them, it may prove what few other states have: equity doesn\u2019t end with a license. It begins with what happens after."

      "text": "The substantial prison population in the United States is strongly connected to drug-related offenses. While the exact rates of inmates with substance use disorders (SUDs) is difficult to measure, some research shows that an estimated 65% percent of the United States prison population has an active SUD. Another 20% percent did not meet the official criteria for an SUD, but were under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of their crime.1\nDecades of science shows that providing comprehensive substance use treatment to criminal offenders while incarcerated works, reducing both drug use and crime after an inmate returns to the community. Treatment while in jail or prison is critical to reducing overall crime and other drug-related societal burdens\u2014such as lost job productivity, family disintegration and a continual return to jail or prison, known as recidivism. Inadequate treatment while incarcerated also contributes to overdoses and deaths when inmates leave the prison system.\nWhat are the challenges in addressing substance use disorders in this population?\nTo be effective for this population, treatment must begin in prison and be sustained after release through participation in community treatment programs. By engaging in a continuing therapeutic process, people can learn how to avoid relapse and withdraw from a life of crime. However, only a small percentage of those who need treatment while behind bars actually receive it, and often the treatment provided is inadequate.\nInmates with opioid use disorders particularly pose a challenge. During their time in prison, many untreated inmates will experience a reduced tolerance to opioids because they have stopped using drugs while incarcerated. Upon release, many will return to levels of use similar to what they used before incarceration, not realizing their bodies can no longer tolerate the same doses, increasing their risk of overdose and death.2 One study found that 14.8 percent of all former prisoner deaths from 1999 to 2009 were related to opioids.3 Insufficient pre-release counseling and/or post release follow-up are partially responsible for this alarming increase in mortality.4\nWhy is treatment so critical in this population?\nScientific research since the mid-1970s shows that treatment of those with SUDs in the criminal justice system can change their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors toward drug use; avoid relapse; and successfully remove themselves from a life of substance use and crime.5-7 For example, studies suggest that using medications for opioid use disorder treatment in the criminal justice system decreases opioid use, criminal activity post-incarceration, and infectious disease transmission.8-10 Studies have also found that overdose deaths following incarceration were lower when inmates received medications for their addiction.11-12\nHow are substance use disorders treated in the criminal justice system?\nThe recent National Academy of Sciences report on Medications for Opioid Use Disorder stated that only 5% of people with opioid use disorder in jail and prison settings receive medication treatment.13 A survey of prison medical directors suggested that most are not aware of the benefits of using medications with treatment, and when treatment is offered, it usually consists of only behavioral counseling, and/or detoxification without follow-up treatment.13\nEffective treatment of substance use disorders for incarcerated people requires a comprehensive approach including the following:\n- Behavioral therapies, including:\n- cognitive-behavioral therapy, which helps modify the patient\u2019s drug-use expectations and behaviors, and helps effective manage triggers and stress\n- contingency management therapy, which provides motivational incentives in the forms of vouchers or cash rewards for positive behaviors\n- Medications including methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone\n- Wrap-around services after release from the criminal justice system, including employment and housing assistance\n- Overdose education and distribution of the opioid reversal medication naloxone while in justice diversion treatment programs or upon release.15\nWhat about the cost of treatment?\nFailure to treat substance use disorder in the criminal justice system not only has negative societal implications, but also proves to be expensive. One study of people involved in the criminal justice system in California showed that engagement in treatment was associated with lower costs of crime in their communities in the 6 months following treatment. In addition, the economic benefits were far greater for individuals receiving time-unlimited treatment.\nA report from the National Drug Intelligence Center14 estimated that the cost to society for drug use was $193 billion in 2007, a substantial portion of which\u2014$113 billion\u2014was associated with drug related crime, including criminal justice system costs and costs borne by victims of crime. The same report showed that the cost of treating drug use (including health costs, hospitalizations, and government specialty treatment) was estimated to be $14.6 billion, a fraction of these overall societal costs.14 It is estimated that the cost to society has increased significantly since the 2007 report, given the growing costs of prescription drug misuse.\nScience suggests that even those who are not motivated to change at first can eventually become engaged in a continuing treatment process, suggesting it is a myth that treatment has to be voluntary to work. More information can be found in the Principles of Drug Abuse Treatment for Criminal Justice Populations: A Research-Based Guide.\nNIDA funded scientists are actively seeking solutions through the NIH HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-Term) initiative. In addition, to support those who work with juveniles and adults within the court system, including judges, counselors, social workers, case workers, and others, NIDA has created materials and has identified other helpful resources that can be used in educating offenders and those who work with them about the science related to drug use, misuse, and addiction.\nAdditional Resources\n- The Science of Drug Use - Discussion Points\n- NIDA Research Dissemination Center\n- NIDA Justice System Research Initiatives\n- Family Resource Center\nPoints to Remember\n- There are high rates of substance use within the criminal justice system.\n- 85% of the prison population has an active substance use disorder or were incarcerated for a crime involving drugs or drug use.\n- Inmates with opioid use disorder are at a higher risk for overdose following release from incarceration.\n- Treatment during and after incarceration is effective and should include comprehensive care (including medication, behavioral therapy, job and housing opportunities, etc.)\n- Despite the cost, treatment in the criminal justice system saves money in the long run.\n- Research is underway to find better solutions.\nReferences\n- Center on Addiction, Behind Bars II: Substance Abuse and America\u2019s Prison Population, February 2010. https://www.centeronaddiction.org/addiction-research/reports/behind-bars-ii-substance-abuse-and-america\u2019s-prison-population\n- Krinsky, C.

      "text": "The war on drugs has caused immeasurable harm in the U.S. And the U.S. has exported its destructive drug policy approaches internationally. Despite growing evidence that punitive approaches don\u2019t work to achieve their stated aims (ending drug use and sales), these approaches have continued. And they\u2019ve had devastating effects on human rights and health. In the U.S. and around the world, they\u2019ve led to mass criminalization, disease transmission, repression, and displacement.\nIn partnership with Harm Reduction International (HRI), our report A World of Harm: How U.S. Taxpayers Fund the Global War on Drugs Over Evidence-Based Health Responses shows how U.S. assistance has supported and expanded destructive and deadly anti-drug responses in low- and middle-income countries around the world.\nIn addition to follow-the-money data analysis, the report contains three case studies. Examples from Colombia, Mexico, and the Philippines reveal the devastating damage done by this spending.\nTo stop the harm, our recommendations demand change at every level. The U.S. must divest from the unjust drug war and invest in programs \u2013 both domestically and internationally \u2013 that prioritize community, health, and justice."

  "argos_summary": "The article argues that drug policy has historically focused on fear and punishment, costing billions, while ignoring the human desire for pleasure, connection, and wellbeing that drives use. It highlights emerging harm\u2011reduction models\u2014such as pleasure management, mindful consumption, and supervised consumption rooms\u2014that balance benefits with safety, citing evidence from Latin America, the U.S., and Europe. The piece also examines the economic and public\u2011health gains of shifting from punitive to rights\u2011based approaches, noting the global shift toward regulated markets, the rise of cannabis drinks, and the need for comprehensive treatment in criminal\u2011justice settings. Finally, it calls for policy reforms that recognize users\u2019 rights, invest in prevention and treatment, and align U.S. and international drug strategies with evidence\u2011based, humane outcomes.",
