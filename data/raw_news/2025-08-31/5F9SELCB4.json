  "description": "The Foyle MP will not be seeking an nomination to enter the contest.",
  "content": "Eastwood rules himself out of Irish presidential race\n\nFormer Social Democratic and Labour Party leader Colum Eastwood has ruled himself out of the Irish presidential election race. BBC News NI understands the Foyle MP will not be seeking an nomination to enter the contest. He had considered standing as an independent candidate after being approached to put his name forward. Eastwood was hoping to secure support from a number of parties, but after consulting with colleagues over the summer he has decided that it is \"not the right time for him\".\n\nColum Eastwood was always facing an uphill battle to get his name on the presidential ballot paper. He put his name in the mix at a time when others were running away from the contest leaving the field empty. But the race is now taking shape, with Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael close to selecting candidates. Sinn F\u00e9in is also now more likely than not to enter the contest. That all means there will little room for independents to get nominated or mount a serious challenge. But we may have to wait before we see the final line up as the election is not expected to take place until near the end of October.\n\nFormer GAA manager in the hunt\n\nOn Saturday, the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) endorsed former Dublin Gaelic football manager Jim Gavin as the Fianna F\u00e1il candidate in the upcoming presidential election. Miche\u00e1l Martin said Mr Gavin was \"the person I think best placed to represent the Irish people as president\". He added that \"Fianna F\u00e1il has nominated people who never had experience as a TD or a minister, Mary McAleese, Douglas Hyde,\" in keeping with the tradition of trying to position the presidency \"above the partisan political realm\". In his letter to party members, Mr Gavin said, if elected as president, he would be \"an active and positive one based on reaching out to every community at home as well as promoting and representing Ireland's values abroad, facilitating the use of the \u00c1ras [presidential residence] for the people and promoting Ireland's language, culture, education and enterprise to the wider world\".\n\nMr Gavin, who previously served in the Irish Defence Forces, was manager of the Dublin team from 2012-2019, when Dublin won six All Ireland Senior Football Championship titles. He stepped down as the manager of the Dublin senior football team in November 2019, just over one month after leading the side to a record breaking fifth All-Ireland title in a row with a replay victory over Kerry at Croke Park. On Saturday, academic Deirdre Heenan ruled herself out of the race. She had been tipped as a potential Fianna F\u00e1il candidate. Posting on X, she said: \"I've greatly appreciated the goodwill, support & encouragement regarding recent speculation around my potential candidacy for president of Ireland. \"I've decided that for now, my priority will remain on my role at Ulster University working to advocate for better healthcare in Northern Ireland.\" MEP S\u00e9an Kelly and former government minister Heather Humphreys are seeking the Fine Gael nomination, while independent politician Catherine Connolly is also running. Entrepreneur Peter Casey, who was born in Londonderry, came second in 2018 with 23.1% of the first preference vote in 2018 and is seeking the nomination once again. Some celebrity candidates have also said they are interested in running, with Riverdance star Michael Flatley and MMA fighter Conor McGregor both seeking backers for their respective campaigns.\n\nHow do you become president of Ireland?\n\nTo run for the office of president of Ireland, you have to be an Irish citizen aged 35 or older. Anyone who wants to stand needs the backing of either 20 members of the Oireachtas (Irish parliament) or four of the 31 local authorities. Michael D Higgins was inaugurated as the ninth president in 2011, when he took over from Mary McAleese, and was re-elected in October 2018. Higgins is not eligible to stand again as he will have completed two full seven-year terms. McAleese is the only president to come from Northern Ireland.\n\nWhat is the role of the Irish president?",

      "text": "Connolly would use voice in 'every way possible' for united Ireland\n- Published\nIrish presidential election hopeful Catherine Connolly has said she would use her voice \"in every way possible\" for a united Ireland.\nThe independent member of the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament) was speaking during a trip to Belfast as part of her campaign.\nShe denied it was a \"waste of time\" to visit Northern Ireland, where people cannot vote in the upcoming election for the Irish Republic.\n\"Wasting my time? Absolutely the opposite. I have always felt that we have cut off a limb of our body in having Northern Ireland cut off from us,\" she said.\nConnolly expressed her support for Irish unity, but said she was \"very conscious\" this would only happen with the consent of the majority of citizens.\n\"It's a building of trust, and it's a building of a vision for a united Ireland where we value everybody,\" she added.\n\"Of course I would like to see it in my term as president, but whether that will happen will be a political decision.\n\"But I will use my voice in every way possible for that vision to be a reality.\"\n'Proud Galwegian'\nSpeaking in west Belfast, Connolly said she was a fluent Irish speaker, a mother of two and a \"proud Galwegian\" as she hails from Galway city.\nShe said the upcoming election was \"particularly important given the state of the world\".\n\"We need a president that uses her voice for peace in the world,\" she added.\n\"A president that says diplomacy is important. A person and a president that calls out genocide for what it is.\"\nAsked by reporters if she was \"courting\" the support of Sinn F\u00e9in, Connolly said she has \"never liked\" the word.\n\"I look forward to support from every single side,\" she added.\n\"I would look on myself as a uniting candidate, somebody that can draw people together and unite on the basic issues that are important to us.\"\nConnolly was also asked how she sees her relationship with unionists in Northern Ireland if she became Irish president.\nShe responded: \"We're a pluralist society - we're in the 21st century. We have to value diversity.\n\"We have to value all traditions, all religions, in an inclusive manner. That's what a strong democracy does.\"\nWho is Catherine Connolly?\nConnolly has been an independent TD (Teachta D\u00e1la, Irish MP) for the Galway West constituency since 2016.\nShe previously served as deputy speaker in the D\u00e1il in Dublin.\nA former member of the Irish Labour Party, she quit after not being allowed to run alongside Michael D Higgins in the 2007 general election.\nConnolly has been backed in her Irish presidential bid by several left-leaning parties and a number of independents.\nOther contenders\nNone of the main parties in the Irish Republic have so far confirmed their plans for the presidential election.\nFine Gael, one of two parties in the Irish government, is deciding between two potential candidates.\nThey are former cabinet minister Heather Humphreys and S\u00e9an Kelly, an MEP (Member of the European Parliament) and former president of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA).\nIt comes after the party's original candidate Mairead McGuinness withdrew due to health issues.\nFianna F\u00e1il, the other party in the coalition, has also yet to decide its plans.\nSpeculation on potential candidates have ranged from former Dublin GAA manager Jim Gavin to Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MP Colum Eastwood.\nSinn F\u00e9in, the main opposition party, has not confirmed whether it will run a candidate or back someone else.\nIts leader Mary Lou McDonald told BBC News NI on Sunday the party would make an announcement in September.\nConnolly's visit to Belfast was supported by People Before Profit.\nThe party's Stormont assembly member Gerry Carroll called on \"all parties who consider themselves left or progressive\" to endorse her campaign.\n\"Catherine is an accomplished, progressive TD and a tireless voice for working-class people across Ireland,\" he said ahead of her visit.\n\"Her principled support for Irish neutrality, outspoken advocacy for the rights of women and migrants, deep respect for the Irish language and passion for economic justice make her the only viable presidential candidate for the left.\"\nWhat is the role of the Irish president?\nThe president of Ireland acts as the head of state.\nIt is a largely ceremonial role, representing Ireland at public events at the national and international level.\nOnly citizens residing in the Irish Republic have the right to vote in presidential elections.\nTo run for the office, you have to be an Irish citizen and aged over 35.\nCandidates also need the backing of either 20 members of the Oireachtas (Irish houses of parliament) or four of the 31 local authorities.\nMichael D Higgins was inaugurated as the ninth president in 2011 and was re-elected in October 2018.\nHe is not eligible to stand again as he will have completed two full seven-year terms.\nHiggins succeeded Mary McAleese, who has been the only president from Northern Ireland.\nRelated topics\n- Published19 August\n- Published6 days ago"
