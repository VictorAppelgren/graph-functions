  "content": "U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said on Wednesday that the age of legal accountability in Washington, D.C., should be lowered to the age of 14 in light of the recent assault of former Department of Government Efficiency worker Edward Coristine, also known as \u201cBig Balls.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe D.C. Council, and the president is right, they have got to stop their coddling. Number one, we\u2019ve got to lower the age of responsibility to 14. I\u2019m tired of having these kids commit crimes \u2014 and they are crews, not gangs, in D.C.,\u201d Pirro said during her appearance on Fox News\u2019s \u201cThe Ingraham Angle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got an intern, you said it in your open, an intern from college, he gets shot going out for McDonald\u2019s at 10:30 at night. This kid is trying to help his girlfriend or his friend to a car. He gets assaulted and, but for a cop going by, they would have \u2014 had they gotten him on the ground, they would have stomped him and finished him,\u201d Pirro told host Laura Ingraham. \u201cHe was able to stay standing. This has to end.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Coristine was beaten up by as many as 10 teens during an attempted carjacking near the White House. Two 15-year-old suspects have been charged with unarmed carjacking.\n\nPirro, who was confirmed to her post by the Senate last week, said she is supportive of President Trump\u2019s push to federalize the nation\u2019s capital and argued that violent youth are \u201ccoddled\u201d in Democrat-run cities.\n\n\u201cYouth violence is on the rise, not just in D.C., but across the country. And if you think that these kids need to be coddled, and they need to be hugged, they need to have consequences,\u201d Pirro said on Fox News, where she was previously a co-host. \u201cThey need to understand that enough is enough, that we\u2019re going to put them in jail or some kind of youth rehabilitation detention facility, and not allow the D.C. Council, one of whom I just recently indicted, to take cover for these kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, D.C. is the nation\u2019s capital. People come here for pride and patriotism, not to get assaulted, carjacked or shot, get caught in a crossfire,\u201d she said.",
