      "feedback": "Overall: the draft is informative but far too long and granular for a 4–6 sentence executive brief; condense into a tight, probability-weighted house view anchored to a 3-regime map, with explicit catalysts, risks, and 0–3/0–6 month watch-items, and ensure every assertion cites only the IDs in the SOURCE MATERIAL. Edit 1: replace the sprawling narrative with a 4–6 sentence core that (a) states the base-case Regime A (~50%) with Regime B (~30%) and Regime C (~20%) weights tied to NL5YYTLF2/T1QE6JPIX, (b) states the first-principles transmission (tariffs raise input costs → inflation/real rate risk → multiples compression → capex reallocation to U.S. fabs and AI/data-center infra), and (c) maps to asset implications (e.g., Ford as cyclical proxy; Nvidia-driven AI capex; data-center power costs). Edit 2: quantify every anchor with source IDs (tariff baseline ~10% per SGB2PAZGK; Ford +17% YTD, 5.18% yield, forward P/E ~10.3 per 22PL3Q360 and 65UUBU0OR; 945 TWh data-center demand by 2030 per STBVARD8F; GM capex guidance $10–$12B through 2027 per WTNT85IPR; Nvidia/AI capex link per STBVARD8F). Edit 3: fix governance factuals (Starbucks CEO should be Laxman Narasimhan per O4ZEED2EB) and remove nonessential tangents unless they anchor capex/allocation signals. Edit 4: add explicit near-term triggers and invalidation rules (tariff escalation/rollback; Costa sale bid activity near £2B per STBVARD8F; GM Orion/Spring Hill milestones; Red Sea/shipping signals I2SJU04DF/NBX9RA9WX) with clear two-print invalidation criteria. Edit 5: ensure a concise 0–3 week section that lists 3–4 signals (I2SJU04DF; NBX9RA9WX; QGXA2WQJ3; 8E5QMHLIH) and ties them to asset responses (Shopify, YouTube Music) with the same IDs, and remove redundancies and cross-domain drag. Edit 6: keep a focused, sourced watch-list and avoid mixed consumer-staples detail unless it drives capex/ROI signals; present the causal chain and regime transitions as a single, transparent path with explicit gates and probabilities.",
