  "title": "How Well Does The Fi Collar Work? Here's What Pet Owners Say",
  "description": "Smart dog collars are becoming more popular, and one of the most notable ones is the Fi Smart Dog Collar. What do real owners have to say about it?",
  "content": "How Well Does The Fi Collar Work? Here's What Pet Owners Say\n\nThe traditional dog collar has long been used as a way to display information about your pet, such as its name, home address, and your contact information. But it's not always enough to alleviate the worries of some pet owners. Hazards such as bad weather, dangerous wildlife, or nearby traffic can bring harm to your furry friend in an instant, making time of the essence should they disappear. The Fi Dog Collar aims to provide owners with peace of mind and go a step further to bring the age-old dog collar into the new age. This high-tech accessory acts as a smart collar that keeps track of your dog's location and behavior. Owners can access that information through the accompanying Fi app. Its biggest draw are its GPS capabilities, which give owners a strong reading of where their dog is at any time, no matter the location, as opposed to the more limited range of an AirTag. Similar to your Fitbit, it also relays information about your dog's health, including sleep monitoring, eating, scratching, and even step tracking. The collar comes in a wide array of sizes and colors, all of which are comfortable and long-lasting with an IP68-waterproof rating and three-month battery life. From keeping track of an off-leash pet to providing precise information for vet checkups, the Fi Dog Collar appears to be a versatile tool for any dog owner. But the true testament to any item's value will be how actual users have received the product. So before getting a Fi Dog Collar of your own, sit and stay to hear the good, bad, and ugly that longtime users have experienced.\n\nThe Fi Dog Collar has received largely positive reviews from pet parents. Its powerful functionality and ever-evolving set of advanced features have consistently put it high on the list of smart collar recommendations. As of this writing, the most recent model is the Fi Series 3 and 3+, which will be what we primarily focus our attention on. As its GPS functions are among the collar's biggest draw, this is the aspect that has received the most attention. On Reddit, u/geeniedreamer-78 praised the Fi Dog Collar's on-point tracking capabilities, stating, \"My girl Nala hates being fenced in [...] so she frequently sneaks out of our fence. Fi has alerted me every single time. I just checked my log of over 72 escape attempts for 2023.\" They later shared how the collar even alerted them to their dog's location while encountering a mountain lion. Much of this accuracy can be attributed to the Series 3's ability to use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth while indoors and switch to cellular networks whenever the dog is out of range of these signals. Among the most praised aspects of the Series 3 is its exceptional battery life. When testing the product, PCMag found that only 3% of battery life was used daily during average use, representing an improvement from the Series 2 that lost around 5% a day. Redditor u/AppropriateView9269 also complimented this element, commenting, \"Definitely worth the money [...] the battery lasts forever, I think I charged it maybe 5 times in a year.\"\n\nSome feel that the costs attached could use improvement Even the best tech products have their downsides, and the Fi Dog Collar is no exception. Before purchasing, it's important that we bring up these concerns that might make them ill-suited for your specific situation. As you can imagine, such a high-tech pet gadget comes with a high price tag. Getting a Series 3 or 3+ collar and utilizing any of its features requires a regular subscription. The options include a $99 6-month plan, a $189 annual plan, or a $339 2-year plan. A $19.99 monthly plan is also available, but, as with most monthly subscriptions, it will cost you more in the long run. An additional $20 activation fee is also processed during checkout, no matter the plan. Reviewer Kieran Beckles noted that past Fi Dog Collar models only required a one-time payment for the tracker itself and allowed users to have access to basic features, with the subscription being optional. The app itself has also received criticism, particularly from Android users such one Google Play review, which reads, \"GPS usually doesn't connect to my phone, walk paths are not correct even when I have the ap open on the phone with me. Customer Service is virtually non-existent and not helpful at all.\" Another major limitation for some is that the Fi Dog Collar can only be used in the U.S. While you can still monitor activity while abroad if your dog is still on American soil, the collar won't operate if your dog is traveling with you internationally as it strictly relies on U.S.-based AT&T networks.",

      "text": "How Do Pet Trackers Work? Can You Use An AirTag Instead?\nWhile some pets never really venture anywhere, others, like some cats, take more of a wherever-I-lay-my-hat approach to life. In the course of a given night, they could have roamed anywhere. Concerned owners might consider a pet tracker to help alleviate some of this worry, particularly with the ending of T-Mobile's SyncUP Pets service in November 2023.\nThose new to such products are surely curious about how exactly a pet tracker works and why they're a separate genre of tracker to the likes of an AirTag. Here's how these pet-specific devices work, as well as the differences between them and the ones you'd attach to your luggage before heading to the airport.\nGPS trackers come in various shapes and sizes, and so do those developed specifically for keeping track of pets. Typically small, unobtrusive, and conveniently able to clip to a collar, they use different types of technology. The best type, as is always the case with any device, is the one that fits your specific needs and requirements.\nThe technology behind pet trackers\nAn adventurous pet that journeys further away, like a rural cat, may not be very well served by a Bluetooth tracker, as their effective range is generally limited to about 200 feet. These trackers are convenient to pair with an app, but as always with Bluetooth, the wide compatibility is tempered by the limited distance possible between the paired devices.\nOther pet trackers utilize cell signals in tandem with those from satellites. The GPS device beams your pet's location through the satellites and to your smart device, revealing your loveable companion's location. Such trackers have a considerably greater range, utilizing satellite technology (and potentially Wi-Fi too). The issue is that results are only available via quality coverage: In January 2023, Statista reported that T-Mobile's 54% U.S. 5G share was the nation's largest, indicative of the fact that consistent GPS signals can be difficult to come by. If your connection is even spotty, you won't get precise results. With such trackers, precision is crucial.\nRadio frequencies are also utilized in some pet trackers. A different duo of devices are paired in these cases: a small label and a remote tracker. Holding the latter, the user is pointed toward their pet by the readings, which will be stronger when pointed toward the pet's label. In busy neighborhoods and such areas, though, the signal will be limited, and the lack of a handy map app showing your pet's location is a huge disadvantage.\nWhy not just use an AirTag?\nTypically, the receiver for a pet tracker is small and discreet, helping to keep your pet safe without weighing them down or restricting their movement. The likes of a Tile or AirTag share these traits. As such, you may be tempted to simply clip an AirTag or similar to their collar/leash/harness. While you certainly can, the results might not be what you hoped for.\nAirTags are invaluable for travelers, who may need the reassurance that their baggage has arrived in the country with them. There's a reason, though, that Apple Support states that AirTags are for locating \"personal items\" rather than pets or people.\nThe primary problem is that pet trackers transmit information only between your device and your pet's (satellites notwithstanding). AirTags, by contrast, offer location information when they've been able to triangulate it through another iPhone. Quieter, rural locations may not make such a connection for a long time, if ever. To compound the problem, PitPat tested AirTag connections in a busy dog walking area and noted that \"it was taking up to 15 minutes from the time of the fix for it to be reported on our own iPhone.\"\nWhen pets are lost, time is of the essence, and real-time location information can be crucial. AirTags, unfortunately, can't be relied upon to provide this, and so aren't intended to serve the purpose. Dedicated pet trackers are highly recommended instead."

      "text": "Last Updated on February 29, 2024 by Kieran Beckles\nAre you looking for a smart dog collar and you\u2019ve shortlisted the Fi Series 3 collar but you want to learn about the pros and cons before investing in your hard-earned cash?\nThere\u2019s no shortage of smart dog collar options available to dog owners who are looking for a gps dog collar but few offer live gps tracking, lost dog mode, provides sleep tracking, has a long battery life and sits comfortably on your dog\u2019s neck.\nI started to research the best smart dog collar in the summer of 2023 after I had a frightening and traumatizing experience on my morning walk with my Alaskan Klee Kai Skye and Copper before we encountered a coyote.\nWith a high prey drive, Copper went into a frenzy and managed to slip out of his regular dog collar and chase the coyote up a hill and out of my line of vision. I experienced the longest five minutes of my life as I tried to call Copper back.\nFortunately, Copper did return unscathed but I vowed to invest in a reliable smart dog collar that offered gps tracking along with other features such as having a lost dog mode to be prepared for any future freak occurrences.\nAfter I researched all the top smart dog collar options, I opted to invest in the latest offering from the Fi dog collar series in order to keep Copper and Skye safe whether we\u2019re walking our neighborhood or exploring a new hiking spot.\nIn this article, I\u2019m sharing to take a look at the Fi Series 3 collar, sharing some of the advantages and the disadvantages of the Fi smart dog collar, my pros and cons based upon using the Fi collar for six months and give my overall verdict on the Fi smart collar.\nCut To The Chase: We recommend the Fi Series 3 Collar based upon our experience and you can get $20 off your Fi collar when you click here.\nFi Smart Dog Collar Pros and Cons\nBefore we get started, I want to share that we bought the Fi smart dog collar before we invested in a second one for Skye.\nWe\u2019re going to share our Fi gps dog collar pros and cons based upon our experience using the Fi collar on our Alaskan Klee Kai.\nFi Collar Pros\n\u2022 Live gps tracking\nThe Fi collar uses live gps tracking through wi fi and cellular service to allow pet parents to get their dog\u2019s location through the Fi app.\nIf you live on a property with a lot of land where your dog has ample space to roam, you have your dog\u2019s location at your finger tips through the app.\nOf course, if you\u2019re familiar with a gps dog collar, you\u2019ll know that live gps tracking isn\u2019t a particularly unique feature.\nAny good smart dog collar should offer live gps tracking but I was impressed with the accuracy and reliability of the Fi smart dog collar.\n\u2022 Lost dog mode\nAs I touched upon in my Fi dog collar introduction, I wanted a smart dog collar that could provide support if the situation of a lost dog arose.\nIf your dog is lost, Fi advise activating Live Tracking/Lost Dog Mode which will prompt the Fi collar to look for either a live signal for Live Tracking or will attempt to look for a signal every minute for Original Lost Dog Mode.\nFi recommend testing the lost dog mode once you get your collar because GPS & LTE coverage can vary depending on the location of every pet parent.\nBy using the lost dog mode before disaster strikes, you can familiarize yourself with what lost dog mode looks like on the Fi app in the event that you do need to use it.\n\u2022 Safe zones\nIf you\u2019re familiar with smart collars, you\u2019ll probably heard the term \u201dsafe zones\u201d. These allow dog parents to set up areas of their home, their yard or their property that their dog can safely roam.\nIf your dog\u2019s location changes and they leave the safe zone, you\u2019ll get a notification. You\u2019ll need to make sure you\u2019ve got escape alerts toggled on.\nYou can check the Fi app to see where your dog has gone or activate lost dog mode if required.\n\u2022 Longer battery life\nFi write on their website that the Fi smart dog collar can last up to three months on a single charge.\nI\u2019ve been using the Fi dog collar for the six months and I went through my emails to see how many times the Fi app has sent me a notification that Skye\u2019s Fi dog collar is at 5% or less.\nFi app had messaged me three times about battery life so I\u2019ve been charging Skye\u2019s Fi dog collar once every two months. I consider that impressive battery life compared to the battery life of other smart collars that we\u2019ve previously used.\n\u2022 Sleep tracking\nThe Fi smart dog collar allows pet owners to track their dog\u2019s sleeping patterns. The Fi collar keeps close tabs on how much your dog is sleeping, the quality of their sleep and much more.\nWithin the Fi app, you can see how dog\u2019s sleep tracking stats based upon hours, days, weeks and months. If you\u2019ve got multiple dogs, you can see their individual sleep tracking stats.\nWhen I had to the sleep tab on the Fi app, I can see the sleep tracking for Copper and Skye. Copper sleeps on average 10.8hrs a night and 7hrs a day. Skye, on the other hand, sleeps 13hrs a night and 6.5hrs a day. So sleep tracking shows Skye sleeps more per day!\n\u2022 Activity tracking\nYou\u2019d expect dog trackers to offer activity tracking \u2013 and Fi dog tracker is no different. The Fi collar offers stats based upon your dog\u2019s daily steps, miles walked and how your dog\u2019s stats compare to similar dogs and all dogs.\nI really liked how Fi dog collar offer this feature \u2013 it made me realise I need to find more time for longer walks!\nYou can head to the activity tab of the Fi app and see your dog\u2019s activity tracking. I could see Skye averages 231,000 steps a week and 10 miles a week. Copper racked up 373,000 steps and 9.4 miles a week.\n\u2022 Integrated design\nIn the UK, we previously used Tractive but Copper and Skye always looked a little uncomfortable wearing the GPS tracker. The GPS tracker had a clunky design that look to be weighing down my little dogs. Not only that, but the GPS tracker was an eye sore.\nThe Fi Series 3 collar has an integrated design that really caught my eye. The Fi collar band comes in four colors and you attach the Fi device to your dog\u2019s collar to offer a streamlined GPS collar unlike some of their competitors.\nCopper and Skye looked much more comfortable wearing the Fi smart dog collar. Once we had Fi device attached, we never took the Fi smart collar off. That\u2019s different to the Tractive that we were constantly removing.\n\u2022 Waterproof\nSeeing as we lived in the UK a long time, we always check to see whether a dog tracker is waterproof.\nThe Fi dog collar is waterproof so if you\u2019ve got a dog who likes to go for a dip, or you live in a location that rains a lot or if you\u2019ve got a toddler who likes to throw things down the loo, you don\u2019t have to worry about your Fi collar getting wet.\n\u2022 Fi Dog Community\nThere\u2019s a social element to Fi dogs that allows you to connect with other Fi dogs in a social setting.\nOnce we got our Fi dog collar series 3, we could see how Copper and Skye\u2019s activity compares to other dogs in our area, in our state and in the county as a whole.\nWithin the Fi app, you can easily see how your dog ranks by hitting the Rank tab.\nFi Collar Cons\n\u2022 Fi subscription\nThe Fi Series 3 only works with an active Fi subscription within the Fi app. This is different to previous Fi Series 2 that does allow users to access basic features without an active Fi subscription.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a new collar, and you\u2019ve decide the Fi dog collar is for you, you\u2019ll need to keep in mind that you\u2019ll require a Fi subscription.\nThere are lots of options \u2013 monthly memberships, semi-annual plan, annual subscription and bi-annual option. You can check out the costings below or in this Fi dog collar review here.\nYou\u2019ll need to commit to a minimum six-month Fi subscription service before you can cancel.\n\u2022 Multiple dogs\nIf you do decide to get a Fi collar and you\u2019ve got multiple dogs, you\u2019ll need a Fi collar series subscription for both dogs. As far as I\u2019m aware, there\u2019s no discount for multiple dogs, which is slightly disappointing.\nFor current Fi users who add another dog, I\u2019d like to see Fi offer a discount for being an existing member of their community.\n\u2022 Fi Dog Collar Cost\nThere\u2019s little doubt that the Fi dog collar is a premium smart collar that requires a significant upfront investment from dog parents.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a smart dog collar, you\u2019re paying for lost dog mode, long lasting battery life, gps function, sleep tracker and more.\nBut there are more affordable options if you want a gps collar.\n\u2022 Just four colors\nThe Fi dog tracker comes in four colors if you\u2019re looking at the Fi series 3 \u2013 yellow, blue, gray and pink. It\u2019s a limited range and I\u2019d like to see more options for the Fi collar.\nMy Personal Experience \u2013 A Brief, Honest Fi Collar Review\nNow that I\u2019ve shared my pros and cons of the Fi Smart dog collar, I wanted to share my experience using the Fi collar over the past six months or so.\nWe had used a Tractive tracker in the UK but we stopped using the device in early 2023 before we moved back to California.\nRecklessly, I didn\u2019t consider investing in new dog trackers for Skye and Copper despite living on my family\u2019s property that has a half acre of space in an area where there\u2019s a lot of wildlife.\nFollowing Copper\u2019s coyote encounter, I decided it was time to invest in a reliable gps dog collar.\nThe Fi smart collar was my top choice because I really liked how the Fi collar series offers an integrated design that was easy to use, hassle free, simple to charge and has a streamline appearance.\nAs I mentioned above, I\u2019ve only charged Skye\u2019s Fi gps dog collar three times in six months. That\u2019s the longest battery life of any gps dog tracker that I\u2019ve tried and tested.\nIt\u2019s simple to charge \u2013 just attach the Fi Series 3 to the Fi base. I love having the Fi base rather than having to fuss around with cables. It\u2019s a small thing but the Fi base is convenient.\nCopper and Skye appear to enjoy wearing the Fi collar much more than other trackers we\u2019ve used. It\u2019s relatively lightweight and barely noticeable on their neck.\nAlthough we live in an area with patchy cellular network, I\u2019ve used the Fi app to find my dog\u2019s location during practice runs in the event Copper or Skye left a safe zone.\nIn my experience, the Fi collar offers accurate and reliable tracking so I feel good knowing that it\u2019ll find either of my pup\u2019s location.\nWhile I invested a lot of money in two Fi Series 3 dog collars, I believe it\u2019s worth the price considering the peace of mind their service provides \u2013 which I can\u2019t put a price on!\nIs The Fi Collar Cost Worth It?\nContinuing on from my previous point, it\u2019s not until you have an experience like I had with Copper and his pursuit of the coyote, that you appreciate the importance of having a reliable gps tracker on your dog.\nIn those hellish five minutes, I was already bracing myself to tell my wife that I lost Copper and our Alaskan Klee Kai pack had been reduced to one. When Copper returned, I swore I would take more precautions.\nThe Fi Series 3 collar and subscription is expensive. However, we signed up to their bi-annual plan to make the biggest saving possible. We paid $350 for the Fi Series 3 collar and a two-year membership. That works out at $3.20 a week.\nYou can read my Fi dog collar review that places an emphasis on the pricing, but I\u2019ll give a quick breakdown of the cost here.\nYou can go for the monthly plan that works out at $4.40 a week or $19 a month. There\u2019s a six-month plan that costs $3.90 a week or $102 every six months. Next we\u2019ve got the annual subscription which is priced at $3.70 a week or $192 annually. Finally, you can opt for the two-year plan that costs $3.20 a week or $336 every two years.\nIt\u2019s important to remember every Fi collar requires a $20 activation fee.\nIn my experience, the Fi Series 3 was worth the price but I acknowledge it\u2019s a pricy smart dog collar.\nWhere To Buy The Fi Collar\nIf you\u2019re ready to invest in a Fi collar, you can click this link or the button below to get your hands on a Fi dog collar for your furry friend.\nDo We Have A Fi Collar Coupon Code Or Discount?\nWe reached out to Fi and managed to secure a helpful discount for our Life With Klee Kai community.\nYou can save $20 on your Fi Series 3 collar by clicking here or the button below and using coupon code \u201cKleeKai20\u201d at the discount.\nIs There Anything Else To Consider?\nIf you\u2019ve got any questions about the Fi Series 3, you could always search out some other Fi users to get their verdict.\nAlternatively, Fi have a good customer service team that we\u2019ve contacted in the past when we\u2019ve had questions.\nThe Fi collar is not a shock collar so there\u2019s no static force to stop your dog barking unlike some other dog collars on the market.\nThe cell phone service is provided by AT&T \u2013 you get unlimited AT&T LTE-M connectivity.\nWrapping Things Up \u2013 Final Thoughts\nWe\u2019ve reached the end of our Fi Series 3 smart dog collar pros and cons.\nHaving bought two dog collars and used the Fi Series 3 over the past six months, I\u2019ve discovered some of the advantages and disadvantages of the Fi Series.\nOverall, I believe the Fi Series 3 smart dog collar is worth the investment considering the peace of mind it\u2019s provided my wife and I that our dogs are safe.\nWith an incredibly long lasting battery life, activity tracking, lost dog mode, sleep tracking and more, the Fi Series is a versatile smart dog collar with more pros then cons.\nKieran runs Life With Klee Kai on social media and other online platforms alongside his wife Yasmin.

So, if your dog runs out the gate you forgot to close, you\u2019ll be the first to know.\nACTIVITY MONITORING\nFi monitors the steps your dog takes and compares it to other dogs wearing a Fi collar, so you\u2019ll always know how much exercise they\u2019re getting, and how much more they need. Set daily exercise goals to hit and view all previous walks and activity. Keep your dog happy and healthy with Fi.\nLOST DOG MODE\nWe\u2019re putting an end to lost dogs. If your dog\u2019s got out, enable Fi\u2019s unique Lost Dog Mode at the click of the button. A red light will appear on their collar, and the collar will report its location every minute as they move. Make sure you never lose hide and seek again, with Fi.\nLTE TECHNOLOGY\nIntroducing the world\u2019s first LTE dog collar. Running on a brand new LTE-M network, you\u2019ll only receive the most accurate GPS location reports and always know where your dog is.\nBATTERY LIFE\nIf we lose our dog the last thing we should worry about is battery life. Part of the reason we built Fi is because we didn\u2019t feel that other smart collars offered enough value to us dog owners. On average, our collars last 3 months between charges. So, it\u2019s another thing you don\u2019t have to worry about.\nADD OWNERS AND DOG WALKERS\nWe understand that you won\u2019t always be the only one looking after your dog.

      "text": "5 Of The Highest Rated Smart Collars To Keep Track Of Your Dog\nFor many of us, our pets provide long-term companionship, give us joy, and may even boost our lifespans. It's no wonder we make an effort to make their lives as long, happy, and comfortable as possible. With technology getting better every year, it's a relief to know that our furry friends are not getting left behind, especially when it comes to trackers.\nSmart collars with trackers are a great way to know what your furry friends are up to during the day and provide useful information about their overall well-being. While some people have resorted to using an AirTag or the Tile to keep track of their dogs, the reality is that it's not always the ideal solution. Unlike pet trackers, which are specifically designed to withstand the lifestyle of our furry friends, ordinary trackers are not built with them in mind.\nPet trackers have many other features that pet owners will appreciate, such as health tracking, chew-proofing, and geolocation monitoring. Some pet trackers even have predictive disease technology, which can hopefully warn you if your dog could potentially be ill or might require treatment for hip problems.\nDepending on your dog's specific needs, you can get a pretty good value for specialized pet trackers instead of just a generic one for loose items. So, if you're in the market for a dedicated pet tracker, here are a few top-rated ones you should probably have on your list.\nFitBark GPS + Health\nDesigned for \"escape artists,\" FitBark is a tracking tool for pets that refuse to stay at home. FitBark is a fitness-focused pet collar that works with human fitness trackers such as HealthKit (Apple), Google Fit (Android), and Fitbit. Because of this, you can quickly glance over your dog's daily activity levels alongside yours on your Apple Watch, Fitbit, and other devices.\nAlthough its battery can last up to five weeks, it is important to note that it doesn't have instant exit alerts and only works in the United States. Weighing at only 16g, it's light enough for smaller dogs (and even cats) to use comfortably. Using its companion app, you can monitor your pet's overall health index, which takes into account their activity and sleep quality. Similar to human fitness apps, FitBark also lets you set goals for your dog and compare their fitness levels versus similar dogs in breed, age, and weight.\nAside from this, the FitBark collar can also monitor known medical issues and let you share your pet's profile with their caregivers. So, if anything ever happens to your dog while you're away, your friends, family members, dog sitters, or vets will have access to their health data.\nThe FitBark GPS + Health monitor retails for $99.95. If you want additional GPS features, you can try its 30-day free trial and decide if you want a no-commitment monthly membership ($9.95) or a three-year plan for $214.\nPetfon 2\nIf you want a no-frills GPS tracker, the Petfon 2 may be the one for you. The Petfon 2 can track your dog up to 0.65 miles in dense environments like city centers or 3.5 miles in open-air surroundings. This makes it a great option for off-grid walks around town, but not if you plan to go into forests and tunnels.\nWith the Petfon companion app, you can define safe areas and receive notifications if they leave the premises. Petfon also lets you store and record voice commands, which you can use to communicate with your pet remotely. Aside from this, it also has colorful lights, which can be useful if your pup likes to play hide-and-seek in the dark.\nAlthough it only has a single color option (blue), it doesn't include a collar. This means you have endless options for customization and are free to choose better-fitting collars or those with quirkier designs. Not to mention, it is designed to last up to 16 hours and has a compact charging station reminiscent of an earphone charging case. Because it uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, it has no geographical limitations for usage. Lastly, while it is relatively lightweight (27.6g), the Petfon 2 isn't waterproof (with an IP65 rating) and cannot be used for swimming.\nAt $179, the Petfon 2 isn't exactly a cheap smart tracker, but it doesn't have a monthly subscription fee to use the app, so it makes up for it.\nHalo Collar 3\nThe Halo Collar 3 has three types of tracking features: location, activity, and safety. In its latest iteration, Halo uses AI-powered GPS, real-time tracking, and all carrier tracking, which connects to the strongest signal worldwide. However, its 24-hour battery life can be limiting for some paw parents.\nWith Halo's virtual fence feature, you can set geofences your pet is allowed to roam. Once the tracker detects it has left the fenced area, the smart collar will do two things: send your mobile phone an alert and emit sounds, vibrations, or static feedback via your dog's collar. The Halo Collar 3 comes in two sizes: small (11\u201315 inches) and medium/large (15\u201330 inches). Because of this, it is not necessarily an ideal dog collar for puppies or smaller breeds. In fact, Halo even shares that its system is proven for dogs over five months old and over 20 pounds.\nThe Halo Collar 3 retails for $699 in four colors: sunburst, graphite, orchid, and ivory. Additionally, you'll also need to factor in the additional cost of its membership plan, which is required to keep the collar active. If you pay annually, Halo plans start for as low as $5.09 per month. In partnership with dog behaviorist Cesar Millan, Halo offers a patented training program with its plans. However, if you wish to use more advanced features like activity reports, partner discounts, and exclusive events with experts, you may want to get a higher-tiered plan.\nWhistle Switch\nUnlike Sony's robot dog, Aibo, real dogs are prone to illness. No matter how careful you are, dogs can get health issues from things like interacting with other sick animals or eating pathogen-contaminated pet food. Aside from tracking your pet's location, Whistle's Switch Smart Collar can help make sure they are taken care of holistically by showing you a view of their activities throughout the day, wellness goals, poop scanning, skin issues, and other critical health data metrics.\nOne advantage that Whistle has over its competition is its long battery life, which can last an average of 15 days, as well as interchangeable battery packs straight out of the box. Alternatively, you may also buy extra batteries on its website for $49.99. It also has switchable collar styles to make it customizable.\nThe Whistle Switch Smart Collar retails for $149 in two colors: shadow (black) and athleisure (yellow). Although it comes in three sizes, XS/S (8\u201311 inches), S/M (12\u201318 inches), and M/L (16\u201324 inches), Whistle specifies that it is designed for dogs who weigh five pounds or more. Based on its sizing chart, it is not ideal for extra large breeds, so if you have a St. Bernard with a 26\u201332 inch neck, it may not be for you.\nBecause the Switch is powered by AT&T, you may run into issues if the LTE coverage in your area isn't great. Moreover, it's only available in the United States and Canada. You will also be required to avail yourself of a subscription plan, which costs $99/year.\nFi Series 3\nWith up to three months of battery life, chew resistance, real-time GPS, and other features, Fi leads the pet tracker pack in several ways. It is also available in four colors and five sizes (XS to XL) that cover dogs with necks from 9.5 to 31 inches.\nCompared to the AirTag, which is only rated up to IP67, the Fi Series 3 is rated IP68, so it can withstand swimming, playing, and diving. A perfect companion for dogs that love being wet, the Fi Series 3 can remain submerged in salt water, fresh water, and chlorine for up to 30 minutes at a 1.5-meter depth. The Fi Series 3 is also IP66K rated, which means it has passed being jet sprayed at 150 PSI in a 1/4-inch stream for three minutes without any damage, so it is great if your pup needs to be hosed down regularly.\nUnfortunately, the Fi Series 3 isn't an ideal tracker for dogs that travel abroad frequently. Because it can only connect to the AT&T network, the Fi Series 2 Smart Dog Collar only works in the United States. The Fi Series 3 requires a Fi membership to access GPS/LTE tracking, which costs $20 for a one-time activation fee. Afterward, you'll need to commit at least six months for both its three-month ($54) and one-month ($19) pricing. There is also a 30-day trial available, so you have time to decide if you want to prepay for up to two years to save money.\nTips when choosing a pet tracker for your dog\nWhen choosing the right pet tracker for your pet, you'll need to evaluate your dog's specific needs beforehand. One of the key considerations you need to take into account is accessibility. Depending on how mobile your pet is, you may need to be able to track them a few feet from your home or miles away. If you like to travel with your dogs, you may even need to consider if your tracker has international coverage.\nSecond, you need to find the right size. Not only can ill-fitting trackers be uncomfortable for your pet, but they can also lead to it unceremoniously falling off or inaccurate health status readings. While many pet tracking brands offer various sizes, they typically cater to standard dog sizes but not smaller or larger than average-sized pups.\nThird, you'll need to think about durability. If you have a dog that tends to go off on adventures throughout the day, you'll need a tracker that can survive possible fluctuating temperature changes, getting wet in the rain, or being covered in snow. Not to mention, having a tracker with virtual fence features would be a big bonus.\nLastly, if you have an elderly or sickly dog, investing in a tracker that emphasizes health markers can make more of a difference than just having a wider tracking coverage area. With time, you may even need to buy different collars as your dogs outgrow them or their needs change."

  "argos_summary": "The Fi Dog Collar, particularly the Series 3 and 3+, is a high-tech smart collar designed to enhance pet safety through GPS tracking, health monitoring, and activity tracking, all accessible via a companion app. Users have praised its accurate tracking capabilities and long battery life, with some reporting it has effectively alerted them during emergencies. However, the collar requires a subscription for full functionality, which has drawn criticism for its cost, and it is limited to use within the U.S. Overall, many pet owners find the investment worthwhile for the peace of mind it provides.",
