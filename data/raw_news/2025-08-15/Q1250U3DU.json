  "content": "President Trump waves as he boards Air Force One early Friday at Joint Base Andrews, Md., for a flight to Alaska to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPresident Trump is on his way to Alaska for a high-stakes summit with Vladimir Putin, indicating he will take a tougher line with the Russian leader over a ceasefire in Ukraine after three brutal years of war.\n\nSpeaking with reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said Putin would face \u201ceconomically severe\u201d consequences if negotiations in Anchorage today fail to yield progress toward peace. He said that only Ukraine could decide whether to cede territory to Moscow. And he expressed support for U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine in any future peace agreement, so long as they fall short of NATO membership for the beleaguered nation.\n\n\u201cYes, it would be very severe,\u201d Trump said. \u201cVery severe.\u201d\n\nTraveling from Moscow, Putin is bringing along several Russian business leaders, according to the Kremlin, a sign he hopes to begin discussions on normalizing relations with Washington. But Trump said he would not discuss business opportunities until the war is settled.\n\nIt\u2019s a position that will relieve allies in Europe that have been hoping Trump would approach Putin with a firm hand, after months of applying pressure on Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to prepare to make concessions to Moscow.\n\nZelensky was not invited to the Alaska negotiations. But Trump said he hoped his meeting on Friday would lead to direct talks \u201cvery shortly.\u201d\n\nTrump had said in recent days that a peace deal would include the \u201cswapping\u201d of land, a prospect roundly rejected in Kyiv. The Ukrainian constitution prohibits territorial concessions without the support of a public referendum.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be discussed, but I\u2019ve got to let Ukraine make that decision,\u201d the president said of land swaps. \u201cI\u2019m not here to negotiate for Ukraine. I\u2019m here to get them to the table.\u201d\n\nTrump will host Putin at the Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage later on Friday, the first meeting between a U.S. and Russian president since 2021.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry officials said Wednesday that Putin\u2019s war aims remain \u201cunchanged.\u201d And an aggressive Russian advance along the front lines this week provided evidence to military analysts that Moscow has no plans to implement a ceasefire.\n\nThe two leaders are expected to greet one another on the tarmac before meeting privately. Afterward, they will take an expanded lunch meeting with their aides, followed by a news conference, according to the White House.",

      "text": "California begins printing IOUs\n- Share via\nSACRAMENTO \u2014 Deep in debt and short on cash, California on Thursday churned out its first batch of IOUs in nearly two decades amid grumbles from bankers, growing public outrage and scant progress in negotiations to resolve the state\u2019s widening budget deficit.\nThe state controller\u2019s office fired up a pair of printing presses and began rolling out nearly 29,000 IOUs totaling more than $53 million, most of them destined for residents around the state still awaiting income tax refunds. Recipients also include some businesses, pensioners, health clinics, college students and many others who get checks from the state.\n\u201cWe never thought we would do it again,\u201d said Dorothy Cottrill, who manages check disbursement at the state controller\u2019s office and still remembers the last time the state spun out IOUs in the lean days of 1992.\nThe unusual move came hours after a panel of state finance officials set the annual interest rate for the IOUs at 3.75% for banks and other financial institutions willing to accept the vouchers. Some banks, including Bank of America, Citi and Wells Fargo, have agreed to honor the paper, but only until July 10. Many recipients could receive their IOUs after that date.\nThose who don\u2019t have a bank that will cash the IOUs can redeem them from the state Oct. 2, or sooner if officials settle on a solution to the financial crisis.\nRodney K. Brown, president and chief executive of the California Bankers Assn., said the state\u2019s failure to resolve the budget crisis \u201chas placed a tremendous burden on California\u2019s citizens, communities and banks.\u201d\nState officials estimated that without a budget resolution they will have to issue $3.2 billion in IOUs in July and $1.65 billion in August.\nState Controller John Chiang said the IOUs \u201care a sign that the state is being fiscally mismanaged\u201d and a precursor to further credit downgrades for California, already the lowest-rated state on Wall Street.\nThe IOUs come two days after state Senate Republicans, with the support of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, blocked an eleventh-hour attempt by Democratic leaders to push through budget proposals that would have staved off the IOUs, at least temporarily.\nOutside the Capitol, the mood was cross. Richard Blitz, a 73-year-old owner of a downtown Los Angeles variety store, said the IOUs seem a hollow gesture by a state government struggling for answers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s candy for a hungry man,\u201d he said. \u201cBanks will accept it for a week or two, but what will happen after that?\u201d\nThomas Bent, medical director of the Laguna Beach Community Clinic, expects to receive more than $10,000 in IOUs and may be forced to dip into reserves after the big banks stop accepting them.\n\u201cI can\u2019t pay bills with IOUs,\u201d Bent said. \u201cI can\u2019t pay salaries with IOUs.\u201d\nLos Angeles County officials said they should have enough cash in the bank to operate unfettered through the summer and would cash its IOUs with Bank of America. They said that after the July 10 cutoff, the county might become something of a bank, purchasing the IOUs from institutions and individuals, then holding them until they can reap the interest from the state.\nThe county performed a similar role when the state issued IOUs 17 years ago.\nWith the state economy hobbled, tax receipts waning and the budget deficit continuing to grow, the governor declared a fiscal emergency Wednesday and ordered state workers to take a third unpaid furlough day each month. He also issued a new list of proposed cuts to schools and public universities to address a deficit that his finance team now says has swelled to $26.3 billion.\nOn Thursday, the Department of Motor Vehicles announced it will close its offices each of the Fridays that remain in July to comply with Schwarzenegger\u2019s latest furlough order.\nBut the governor and legislative leaders remained divided on several fronts. Schwarzenegger wants to save money by tackling fraud and waste in the state\u2019s health and welfare programs and to deflate state worker pensions. Democrats are pressing to retain as much as possible the state\u2019s social safety net: welfare, children\u2019s health insurance, in-home support for the elderly and other programs.\nThe governor said during an appearance in Los Angeles that lawmakers apparently have decided \u201cit is more important to protect state employees and to protect all of the different people and labor and special interests, rather than protecting . . . the people of California, the taxpayers.\u201d\nA downcast Assembly Speaker Karen Bass (D-Los Angeles) blamed Schwarzenegger for linking a budget solution to his push for a government overhaul.\n\u201cFrankly, I have really begun to be concerned,\u201d Bass said, adding that Schwarzenegger\u2019s priority seems to be \u201cfixing his legacy.\u201d\nAn additional difficulty looms. Budget negotiators say it seems increasingly clear that a balanced budget could require suspending school funding guarantees embodied in Proposition 98 -- and wrangling with the powerful California Teachers Assn.\nStill, most lawmakers left the capital for the holiday weekend. Legislative leaders said they would remain behind to continue negotiations.\nMeanwhile, the controller\u2019s office pumped out the IOUs for only the second time since the Great Depression. The black-inked documents look like checks but have the words \u201cregistered warrant\u201d emblazoned on them.\nWorkers placed the foot-high piles of paper promises into boxes for sorting, packing and shipping as news photographers watched.\nThe state\u2019s Constitution requires that education and debt service payments be made -- in cash -- before all others. After that, those who must be paid in cash include state workers, the state\u2019s CalPERS and CalSTRS pension funds, In-Home Supportive Services and Medi-Cal providers.\n--\npatrick.mcgreevy@latimes.com\nTimes staff writers Shane Goldmacher, Evan Halper , Molly Hennessy-Fiske, Gerrick Kennedy and Michael Rothfeld contributed to this report.\n--\n(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)\n\u2018We\u2019re very disappointed . . . that California has taken the unfortunate step of issuing IOUs. . . .

      "text": "ICE walks back rapid deportation of longtime immigrant without court hearing\n- Share via\n- Under federal law, immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for fewer than two years can be placed in expedited removal proceedings, which bypass the immigration court process.\n- Attorneys for a woman who was slated for deportation to Guatemala questioned why she was placed expedited removal given that she has lived in the U.S. for 30 years.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security has walked back what lawyers called an illegal attempt to fast-track the deportation of a woman who has lived in the U.S. for nearly 30 years and to expel her without an immigration court hearing, her attorneys said.\nLawyers for Mirta Amarilis Co Tupul, 38, filed a lawsuit earlier this month to stop her imminent deportation to Guatemala. A U.S. district court judge in Arizona dismissed the case Wednesday after the federal government moved the woman to regular deportation proceedings and agreed in writing not to attempt expedited removal again, her lawyers said.\nThe woman, a 38-year-old single mother of three children with U.S. citizenship, has been in the U.S. since she was 9 years old.\nThe judge had granted an emergency request to temporarily pause the deportation while the case played out in court.\nThe case highlighted broader concerns that the Trump administration is stretching immigration law to speed up deportations in its effort to remove as many immigrants as possible.\nFederal law since 1996 holds that immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for fewer than two years can be placed in expedited removal proceedings, which bypass the immigration court process. Longtime immigrants, however, cannot be removed until they\u2019ve had a chance to plead their case before a judge.\nIn a sworn declaration, one of Co Tupul\u2019s attorneys wrote that a deportation officer told her the agency had a \u201cnew policy\u201d of placing immigrants in expedited removal proceedings after their first contact with immigration authorities.\n\u201cThis appears to have been a test case in which the administration attempted to enforce a \u2018new policy\u2019 against Ms. Co Tupul,\u201d Eric Lee, one of Co Tupul\u2019s attorneys, said Thursday. \u201cThe district court quickly shut down this effort in no uncertain terms. Maybe this has slowed the government\u2019s efforts to expand expedited removal, or maybe the government is waiting for another test case where the non-citizen lacks legal representation.\u201d\nHelp desks at immigration courts disappear along with other basic legal services as Trump administration ramps up deportation efforts.\nEmails reviewed by The Times showed that Co Tupul\u2019s lawyer provided extensive evidence of her longtime residence. Immigration officials told the lawyer that her client would remain in expedited removal proceedings anyway.\nAssistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said that after Co Tupul\u2019s lawyers provided documentation verifying she had lived in the U.S. for more than two years, \u201cICE followed the law and placed her in normal removal proceedings.\u201d\n\u201cAny allegation that DHS is \u2018testing out\u2019 a new policy regarding illegal aliens who have been in the country for longer than two years into expedited removal is false,\u201d McLaughlin added.\nCo Tupul, a Phoenix resident, was pulled over as she drove to her job at a laundromat on July 22. She remains detained at Eloy Detention Center, about 65 miles southeast of Phoenix."

Parents or guardians may be forced to cut spending on other critical needs to fill the gaps, and some may even be forced out of work so they can care for their children,\u201d Jaime-Milehan said.\nRural communities would see programs shutter, and family providers lose their jobs, she wrote.\nThe Trump administration barred undocumented immigrants from Head Start and other federal benefit programs \u2014 a move California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta called \u2018cruel.\u2019\nTony Thurmond, California\u2019s superintendent of public instruction, warned in a declaration that the \u201cchilling effect\u201d from such rules could potentially drive away talented educators who disagree with such policies and decide to \u201cseek other employment that does not discriminate against children and families.\u201d\nThurmond and Jaime-Milehan were among dozens of officials in 20 states and the District of Columbia who submitted declarations in support of those states\u2019 lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\u2019s new rules. Six other officials from California also submitted declarations.\nThe lawsuit followed announcements last month from various federal agencies \u2014 including Health and Human Services, Labor, Education and Agriculture \u2014 that funding recipients would be required to begin screening out undocumented immigrants.\nThe announcements followed an executive order issued by President Trump in which he said his administration would \u201cuphold the rule of law, defend against the waste of hard-earned taxpayer resources, and protect benefits for American citizens in need, including individuals with disabilities and veterans.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s order cited the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, commonly known as welfare reform, as barring noncitizens from participating in federally funded benefits programs, and criticized past administrations for providing exemptions to that law for certain \u201clife or safety\u201d programs \u2014 including those now being targeted for new restrictions.\nThe order mandated that federal agencies restrict access to benefits programs for undocumented immigrants, in part to \u201cprevent taxpayer resources from acting as a magnet and fueling illegal immigration to the United States.\u201d\nCalifornia and the other states sued July 21, alleging the new restrictions target working mothers and their children in violation of federal law.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about waste, fraud, and abuse, we\u2019re talking about programs that deliver essential childcare, healthcare, nutrition, and education assistance, programs that have for decades been open to all,\u201d California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said.\nIn addition to programs like Head Start, Bonta said the new restrictions threatened access to short-term shelters for homeless people, survivors of domestic violence and at-risk youth; emergency shelters for people during extreme weather; soup kitchens, community food banks and food support services for the elderly; and healthcare for people with mental illness and substance abuse issues.\nThe declarations are part of a motion asking the federal judge overseeing the case to issue a preliminary injunction barring the changes from taking effect while the litigation plays out.\nBeth Neary, assistant director of HIV health services at the San Francisco Department of Public Health, wrote in her declaration that the new restrictions would impede healthcare services for an array of San Francisco residents experiencing homelessness \u2014 including undocumented immigrants and U.S. citizens.\n\u201cIndividuals experiencing homelessness periodically lack identity and other documents that would be needed to verify their citizenship or immigration status due to frequent moves and greater risk of theft of their belongings,\u201d she wrote.\nColleen Chawla, chief of San Mateo County Health, wrote that her organization \u2014 the county\u2019s \u201csafety-net\u201d care provider \u2014 has worked for years to build up trust in immigrant communities.\n\u201cBut if our clients worry that they will not be able to qualify for the care they need, or that they or members of their family face a risk of detention or deportation if they seek care, they will stop coming,\u201d Chawla wrote. \u201cThis will exacerbate their health conditions.\u201d\nGreta S. Hansen, chief operating officer of Santa Clara County, wrote that more than 40% of her county\u2019s residents are foreign-born and more than 60% of the county\u2019s children have at least one foreign-born parent \u2014 among the highest rates anywhere in the country.\nThe administration\u2019s changes would threaten all of them, but also everyone else in the county, she wrote.\n\u201cThe cumulative effect of patients not receiving preventive care and necessary medications would likely be a strain on Santa Clara\u2019s emergency services, which would result in increased costs to Santa Clara and could also lead to decreased capacity for emergency care across the community,\u201d Hansen wrote.\nThe Trump administration has defended the new rules, including in court.\nIn response to the states\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction, attorneys for the administration argued that the rule changes are squarely in line with the 1996 welfare reform law and the rights of federal agencies to enforce it.\nThey wrote that the notices announcing the new rules that were sent out by federal agencies \u201cmerely recognize that the breadth of benefits available to unqualified aliens is narrower than the agencies previously interpreted,\u201d and \u201crestore compliance with federal law and ensure that taxpayer-funded programs intended for the American people are not diverted to subsidize unqualified aliens.\u201d\nThe judge presiding over the case has yet to rule on the preliminary injunction."

European officials issued statements in recent days on the futility of Trump negotiating with Putin over Ukraine without Ukraine, urging the U.S. president on Wednesday to not cut a unilateral deal. Kyiv warned that Moscow\u2019s proposals for peace \u2014 rewarding its war of conquest with territorial concessions \u2014 are a nonstarter. Many Russia experts are hoping one side simply decides to call it off.\nDespite their efforts, the summit \u2014 haphazardly scheduled on American soil with days to spare \u2014 is moving ahead, with Trump scheduled to host the Russian leader at a U.S. military base in Anchorage on Friday, the first meeting of its kind since 2021.\nExperts fear Putin may be laying a trap for the Americans, manipulating Trump in private to solidify Russia\u2019s position on the battlefield. But Trump suggested Wednesday that he would demand Putin agree to a ceasefire in Alaska.\n\u201cThere will be very severe consequences\u201d if he doesn\u2019t, Trump told reporters.\n\u2018Very grave risk\u2019\nHosting the meeting is an about-face from Trump, who over much of the summer appeared in the throes of a remarkable transformation on Putin, criticizing the Russian leader in harsh terms for the first time. To the relief and delight of Europe, Trump appeared to be losing his patience \u2014 embarrassed, even \u2014 at Putin\u2019s open refusal to heed his calls for a ceasefire in Ukraine.\nBut Trump\u2019s threats of a response, increasing sanctions against Russia and its trading partners, lasted only a matter of days.\nOn Aug. 6, the president\u2019s special envoy on the crisis, Steve Witkoff, a real estate investor with no experience in diplomacy and no background in the region, was dispatched to Moscow. Planning for a summit began within hours of his departure from the Kremlin.\nOn Tuesday, as White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the summit would amount to a \u201clistening session\u201d for Trump on Putin\u2019s interest in peace, battlefield reports emerged of a significant Russian breach in Ukrainian lines.\nIn a phone call, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Trump that Putin was \u201cbluffing\u201d on his commitments to peace, pressing ahead with an offensive to gain more territory. \u201cThere should be joint pressure on Russia, there should be sanctions \u2014 and there should be a message that if Russia doesn\u2019t agree to a ceasefire in Alaska, this principle should work,\u201d Zelensky said Wednesday.\n\u201cIt sure looks like it\u2019s moving in the wrong direction,\u201d John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security advisor in his first term, told The Times, dismissing Witkoff as a chief culprit behind what he fears is a coming diplomatic crisis: \u201cBetter send the Bobbsey twins.\u201d\nThe perils of this meeting, Bolton said, lie in Putin\u2019s skills as a manipulator. The Russian president may well convince Trump that his designs on Ukraine are reasonable \u2014 and the only way forward.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very grave risk it does become an almost take-it-or-leave-it proposition for Zelensky,\u201d Bolton said. On Wednesday morning, Trump criticized the media for being \u201cvery unfair\u201d to him for quoting \u201cfired losers and really dumb people like John Bolton.\u201d\nRussia invaded the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and its eastern regions in 2014, and launched a full-scale invasion of the country in 2022. Nearly a million Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in pursuit of Vladimir Putin\u2019s war of conquest, according to independent analysts, with hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers adding to the casualty count.\n\u201cClearly, Trump wants to sit down with the guy that he thinks is his friend again,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cAnd from Putin\u2019s point of view, he doesn\u2019t want any pesky Europeans around \u2014 and particularly not Zelensky. He wants to see if he can correct the damage he did.\u201d\nEchoes of Helsinki\nSeven years ago, entering a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Trump set a similar bar for success as Leavitt has this week. \u201cI don\u2019t expect anything,\u201d Trump said in an interview at the time from Scotland, before leaving for Helsinki. \u201cI go in with very low expectations.\u201d\nOn Air Force One en route to Helsinki, he cast himself as a dealmaker and tweeted that, \u201cno matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia,\u201d it would still not be enough to earn him praise. He repeated the turn of phrase Wednesday morning in his post criticizing Bolton.\n\u201cIf I got Moscow and Leningrad free,\u201d Trump wrote, \u201cas part of the deal with Russia, the Fake News would say that I made a bad deal!\u201d\nWhat resulted was a meeting and subsequent news conference that produced one of the most notorious moments of Trump\u2019s first term. On the heels of calling the European Union a \u201cfoe\u201d of the United States, Trump stood beside Putin and took his side over the U.S. intelligence community, disputing its assessment that Russia had interfered in the 2016 presidential election.\nExperts fear that a similar diplomatic rupture could unfold if Trump, deferential to Putin, emerges from their meeting Friday siding with the Russian leader over Ukraine in the war.\nIn recent days, Trump has said that a deal between the two sides would have to include land \u201cswapping\u201d \u2014 territorial concessions that are prohibited by the Ukrainian Constitution without a public vote of support \u2014 and that he would give Zelensky the \u201ccourtesy\u201d of a call after his meeting with Putin, if all goes well.\nTrump\u2019s struggle to get Russia and Ukraine to a negotiating table, let alone to secure a ceasefire, has grown into a fixation for him.\n\u201cThis will be the first U.S.-Russia summit brought about by sheer ignorance and incompetence: The U.S. president and his chosen envoy mistook a Russian demand for a concession,\u201d said Brian Taylor, director of the Moynihan Institute of Global Affairs at Syracuse University.\n\u201cUltimately, this is not a war about this or that piece of territory, but about whether Russia can establish political control over Ukraine, or whether Ukraine will remain free to choose its own domestic and international path,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cTrump\u2019s false suggestion again that Zelensky is somehow at fault for Russia invading Ukraine indicates he still does not understand how we got here or what\u2019s at stake.\u201d\nKonstantin Sonin, a professor at the University of Chicago who has been sentenced in absentia to 8\u00bd years in prison in Russia for publishing information on a Russian massacre of Ukrainian civilians at Bucha, said that Trump\u2019s attempts to negotiate away Ukrainian territory could be diplomatically disastrous \u2014 but will make little difference on the ground.\n\u201cThis is not a very popular view, but I am not sure that the U.S. has that much leverage over President Zelensky to force him into major concessions,\u201d Sonin said. \u201cMany European countries would support Ukraine no matter what \u2014 even at the cost of their relationship with the U.S. With full withdrawal of the U.S. support, the catastrophic scenario, Ukraine will still be able to fight on.\u201d\nPitfalls for both sides\nKremlinologists tend to believe Putin\u2019s training as a KGB officer at the end of the Cold War gave him unique skills to navigate the world stage.\nIn Helsinki \u2014 as he had so often done with other world leaders, including the queen of England and the pope \u2014 Putin kept Trump waiting for half an hour, seen as a move to throw off the U.S. delegation leading up to the meeting.\nLast week, in his meeting with Witkoff, the Russian president offered an Order of Lenin to a CIA official whose son died in Ukraine fighting for Russian forces.\nRussia watchers fear that Friday will be no different. Already, Putin has secured a meeting with the U.S. president on his own terms.\n\u201cWhatever else you think about Putin, he\u2019s an experienced and clever ruler who has successfully manipulated Trump in the past,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cPutin\u2019s intransigence in rejecting Trump\u2019s proposed ceasefire led not to the sanctions that Trump promised to apply last Friday, but an invitation to the United States for a summit at which the U.S. president has already signaled he will endorse territorial changes achieved through military conquest.\u201d\nBut there may also be pitfalls in store for Putin, experts said.\nTrump\u2019s shift in tone on Putin since a NATO summit in The Hague in June suggests it is possible, if unlikely, that Trump is preparing to enter the meeting with a tougher stance. In recent months, the president has seen political benefit in catching world leaders off guard, berating Zelensky and South Africa\u2019s leader in the Oval Office with cameras rolling.\nAt the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit, showered in praise by European leaders, Trump said in unusually clear terms that he was with the alliance \u201call the way.\u201d Days later, he accused Putin of throwing \u201cmeaningless ... bull\u2014\u201d at him and his team over the Ukraine war.\n\u201cI think there is some risk for Putin,\u201d Sonin said. \u201cHe is not comfortable in any kind of adversarial situation \u2014 he quickly gets angry and defensive. And President Trump has the ability to put people in uncomfortable situations publicly. He has never done this to Putin before, but who knows.\u201d\nTo Bolton, the best outcome of the summit would be that Putin fails to persuade Trump that he\u2019s seriously interested in peace.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, but it\u2019s possible,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cI think in the environment that they\u2019ve got, one on one \u2014 only Russians and Americans present \u2014 that\u2019s ideal for Putin to do his thing.\u201d\n\u201cSo he\u2019s got what he wants,\u201d Bolton added. \u201cHe\u2019s on American soil, with no one else around.\u201d\nWhat else you should be reading\nThe must-read: Schools to open with unprecedented protections for children and their parents amid ICE raids\nThe deep dive: Here are the EVs you can buy for less than $35,000\nThe L.A.

And if it\u2019s a good meeting, we\u2019re going to end up getting peace in the very near future.\u201d\nPutin\u2019s positioning ahead of the summit, and Trump\u2019s eagerness for a deal, continue to fuel worries across Europe and in Ukraine that the Alaska negotiations could result in a bilateral agreement designed by Moscow and endorsed by Washington that sidelines Kyiv.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the summit would amount to a \u2018listening session\u2019 for President Trump on the Russian leader\u2019s interest in peace.\nIn London, Britain\u2019s prime minister, Keir Starmer, hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday, offering support for Trump\u2019s effort while placing the onus on Putin to \u201cprove he is serious about peace.\u201d\n\u201cThey agreed there had been a powerful sense of unity and a strong resolve to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,\u201d 10 Downing Street said in a statement.\nTrump said the Alaska summit, to be held at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, is meant to \u201cset the table\u201d for direct talks between Putin and Zelensky that could include himself and European leaders.\nBut addressing reporters, Trump suggested that denying Putin dominion over all of Ukraine \u2014 and allowing him to hold on to the territories he has seized militarily \u2014 would be concession enough from Moscow. The president had said in recent days that land \u201cswapping\u201d would be part of an ultimate peace settlement, a statement rejected by Kyiv.\n\u201cI think President Putin would like to see a deal,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think if I weren\u2019t president, he would take over all of Ukraine.\u201d\n\u201cI am president, and he\u2019s not going to mess around with me,\u201d he added.\nRussian state media reported Thursday that Putin had gathered his advisors to inform them of \u201chow the negotiation process on the Ukrainian crisis is going.\u201d\nTrump, \u201cin my opinion, quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict,\u201d Putin said.\nBut U.S. efforts to get Russia to halt the fighting have proved futile for months, with Moscow pressing forward in an offensive that has secured incremental gains on the battlefield.\nFollowing a meeting Thursday with top government officials on the summit, Russian leader Vladimir Putin said in a short video released by the Kremlin that the Trump administration was making \u201cquite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the hostilities.\u201d\n\u201cPutin thinks that he is winning this war militarily,\u201d said Frederick Kagan, director of the Critical Threats Project, which collaborates with the Institute for the Study of War to produce daily battlefield assessments on the conflict. \u201cHe\u2019s also confident that Western support for Ukraine, and particularly U.S. support, will break, and that when it does, Ukraine will collapse, and he\u2019ll be able to take control of the whole thing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been his theory of victory for a long time,\u201d Kagan said, \u201cand it\u2019s a huge part of the problem, because he\u2019s not going to make any concessions so long as he\u2019s confident that he\u2019s winning.\u201d\nRussian incursions along a strategic portion of the front line, near a crucial Ukrainian logistics hub, spooked Ukraine\u2019s supporters earlier this week. While serious, Kagan said that Russia does not hold the territory, and said that the conditions for offensive Russian operations had been set over the course of months.\n\u201cThe Russians continue to have the initiative, and they continue to make gains,\u201d he added. \u201cThe first step in changing Putin\u2019s calculation about the war is to urgently help the Ukrainians stop the gains.\u201d\nZelensky, after meeting with Starmer in London, said that he and the British leader had \u201cdiscussed expectations for the meeting in Alaska and possible prospects.\u201d\n\u201cWe also discussed in considerable detail the security guarantees that can make peace truly durable,\u201d Zelensky said, \u201cif the United States succeeds in pressing Russia to stop the killings and engage in genuine, substantive diplomacy.\u201d\nTrump and Putin plan on arriving of the U.S. airbase within moments of one another, and are expected to meet on the tarmac before retreating into a private meeting.\nAfterward, Trump and Putin will take questions from the press, the White House said."
