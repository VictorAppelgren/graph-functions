  "content": "HADDONFIELD, NJ \u2014 Haddonfield police plan to ramp up traffic enforcement in an effort to get teenagers to drive more safely.\n\nOfficers are targeting key areas of town to monitor speeding and other traffic violations as part of the new \"Smart Choices Behind the Wheel\" campaign. Although the campaign is designed around teen drivers, any driver can be ticketed for violations. Starting this week, Haddonfield police will increase traffic enforcement on sections of Grove Street, Wood Lane, West End Avenue, Washington Avenue and Chews Landing Road.\n\nHaddonfield police informed student drivers and their parents about the campaign in a letter last week, which the department shared Wednesday on social media. \"Please speak with your teen driver today,\" said the letter from Police Chief Jason Cutler and Borough Commissioner Frank Troy. \"Your voice matters. Reinforce the importance of staying focused, avoiding distractions, maintaining safe following distances, obeying traffic signs and signals, and practicing patience and courtesy behind the wheel.\"",
