  "content": "Nicola Sturgeon has had something of an epiphany in recent days \u2013 she shouldn\u2019t have pushed so hard on her calamitous gender reforms.\n\nThe sound of a stable door slamming shut came as the former First Minister publicised her forthcoming memoir, optimistically entitled Frankly.\n\nShe didn\u2019t anticipate how divisive gender self-ID would be \u2013 which is hard to swallow \u2013 but she still can\u2019t bring herself to disown the policy.\n\nThe autobiography and the accompanying ITV interview are heavy on revisionism, as you\u2019d expect, with a hefty dose of blame-shifting for good measure.\n\nMs Sturgeon could have said sorry for the gender shambles and the damage it did to her party, and admit that she got it badly wrong.\n\nThere are many in the SNP who would warmly welcome such a mea culpa, with an election in nine months, but they will have to keep waiting.\n\nTrue, she says she is \u2018partly responsible\u2019 for a loss of \u2018rationality\u2019 in the debate \u2013 but only \u2018partly\u2019. Who else was First Minister at the time?\n\nTalking about transgender rapist Isla Bryson, Ms Sturgeon says anyone who \u2018commits the most heinous male crime against women probably forfeits the right to be the gender of their choice\u2019 \u2013 but only \u2018probably\u2019.\n\nIronically, the only thing she does take credit for is the White Paper on independence ahead of the 2014 referendum \u2013 she says Alex Salmond wasn\u2019t interested in helping her \u2013 but you\u2019d think she\u2019d want to distance herself from that particular work of fantasy.\n\nShe\u2019s right to say that \u2018people with very low emotional intelligence are probably disproportionately attracted\u2019 to politics \u2013 though she doesn\u2019t seem to realise that she is one of them.\n\nMs Sturgeon reflects and embodies the many deficiencies of the SNP: hubris, self-delusion, self-pity \u2013 and a long record of failure.\n\nHer patchy powers of recall while in office led to evasive performances before parliamentary committees.\n\nThis social justice warrior is happy to bank the cash for a half-baked exercise in blaming everyone else for her own mistakes \u2013 heavy on chat-show revelations about her sexuality and even a new tattoo, and decidedly low on any hint of self-awareness.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that she wants to stake a claim to some kind of political achievement and to be taken seriously \u2013 her book is part of a quest for relevance and credibility.\n\nAside from the tawdry, confessional stuff about the difficulties of her private life, it\u2019s beyond sickening that Ms Sturgeon is desperately trying to craft for herself an elder stateswoman status for which she could never be eligible.\n\nShe kept Scotland trapped in a constitutional doom-loop and left a devastating legacy in the form of a failing education system, stunted economic growth and punitive taxation.\n\nDrug deaths soared to record levels while policing was brought to its knees and our navel-gazing, laughing-stock parliament wasted valuable time on the SNP\u2019s gender obsession.\n\nElsewhere in the UK, Ms Sturgeon was often regarded, inexplicably, as a safe pair of hands and even an inspirational figure.\n\nHer allies in the commentariat were blind to the truth \u2013 that she failed on every aspect of her government\u2019s domestic agenda and created a corrosive culture of secrecy in a vast civil service machine which has become hopelessly politicised under Nationalist control.\n\nSupporters point to Ms Sturgeon\u2019s handling of the Covid pandemic \u2013 she says the ordeal of giving evidence at the public inquiry drove her to the edge of a breakdown, though it\u2019s likely that the same could be said of many of the bereaved who lost relatives to the illness.\n\nIn fact, many of the claims Ms Sturgeon made about Scotland\u2019s success in battling Covid were baseless, or hugely exaggerated.\n\n\u2018Zero Covid\u2019 was touted as a flagship SNP policy before being quietly binned as case rates rose, and we know that despite her denials at the time party hierarchs saw the national crisis as a good moment to push their independence agenda.\n\nRightly, Ms Sturgeon faced a huge backlash over revelations that she and her senior mandarins deleted their WhatsApp messages during the pandemic.\n\nThey claimed that mass deletion was in line with government guidance \u2013 but the families of Covid victims understandably alleged a cover-up.\n\nThere were similar allegations when Ms Sturgeon clung to office after the Salmond debacle by citing the outcome of a report by a former prosecutor who cleared her of breaching the ministerial code \u2013 in perhaps the most heavily redacted report in Holyrood\u2019s history.\n\nThere was no uprising among her acolytes who backed her in a confidence vote.\n\nThe party rallied round Ms Sturgeon in a display of weapons-grade sycophancy \u2013 Jeane Freeman, Health Secretary at the time, hailed the then First Minister as \u2018most excellent\u2019 as she denied her boss had misled MSPs.\n\nIn reality, it was a dismal period during which some of the key institutions of state were dragged into the mire to save Ms Sturgeon\u2019s neck.\n\nNow she has angered friends of her former mentor, Mr Salmond, by claiming he leaked details of a botched in-house probe into sexual harassment complaints against him.\n\nHe\u2019s not here to give his side of the story, but what\u2019s indisputable is that he believed he was the victim of a conspiracy, and the ensuing fiasco \u2013 which saw him take the government he once led to court, and win \u2013 led to an eye-watering bill for taxpayers.\n\nSettling scores with someone who died nearly a year ago is unedifying, but don\u2019t forget that there are books to shift.\n\nMs Sturgeon, bitter and isolated in the political wilderness, is still consumed by the psychodrama of the rift with her old boss \u2013 a pivotal moment in her life and career.\n\nThe rest of us, who were forced to look on from the sidelines, are still counting the cost of Ms Sturgeon\u2019s reign.\n\nHer erstwhile deputy, lame-duck John Swinney, presents himself as a new dawn for a broken party and an exhausted country which longs for change.\n\nYet he was an integral part of the Sturgeon administration \u2013 a loyal consigliere and enforcer who continues to back her radical stance on gender.\n\nSturgeonism, such as it is, lives on in Mr Swinney, who was left to mop up a mess partly of his own creation.\n\nDoubtless he will turn quickly to the index of Ms Sturgeon\u2019s book, like many of his colleagues, searching for his own name.\n\nMemoirs are an act of remembrance \u2013 but for many Scots the Sturgeon years are better forgotten.",

  "summary": "Former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's controversial memoir, Frankly, has sparked controversy over her handling of gender reforms in Scotland, despite her attempts to distance herself from the SNP's disastrous policy. The book, heavy on revisionism and ITV interview, contains numerous revelations about her sexuality, a new tattoo, and a lack of self-awareness. Despite these revelations, Sturgeon still refuses to disown the policy and claims she is \u2018partly responsible\u2019 for a loss of \u2018rationality\u2019 in the debate, but only partially responsible for the loss of rationality in the gender debate. She also criticises the SNP for creating a culture of secrecy in a vast civil service machine that has become politicised under Nationalist control. Critics argue that many of her claims about Scotland's success in battling the Covid pandemic were exaggerated and that her party's handling of the issue was a waste of time and wasted valuable time. Sturgeon's tenure as First Minister led to a failed education system, a failing education system and increased drug deaths. She was also accused of creating a dysfunctional drug policy and tax system, leading to record levels of drug deaths and increased tax evasion. Her critics argue that she failed to adequately address the issue of policing and criminalisation of policing.",

      "text": "Now Nicola Sturgeon takes aim at prison bosses over toxic gender reform chaos\nNicola Sturgeon has tried to blame prison chiefs for trans rapist Isla Bryson being sent to a women\u2019s jail.\nThe former First Minister hit out at the Scottish Prison Service for the way it handled the case and said she \u2018lost the dressing room\u2019 over the issue.\nIn her autobiography the SNP MSP, who had just a month earlier had pushed through controversial gender reform legislation, claimed she was \u2018completely blindsided\u2019 when the Bryson case sparked a public outcry.\nShe said: \u2018I had no advance warning that the case was pending. To this day, I don\u2019t understand how it could be that no one in the Scottish Prison Service or Scottish government officialdom thought it important to flag it up to me.\n\u2018It isn\u2019t for a First Minister to decide which prison an individual goes to, as this is an operational matter, but with some advance warning I could have been ready to explain, and hopefully calm, the situation. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t have mattered, the damage might have been done anyway, but at least I could have tried.\u2019\nShe said the story \u2018went nuclear\u2019 and left her \u2018on the back foot, fighting a fire that was already out of control\u2019.\nMs Sturgeon also admitted her \u2018communication skills deserted me\u2019 over the issue and she was \u2018like a rabbit caught in the headlights\u2019 when confronted by questions over whether Bryson, a male-born double rapist, formerly known as Adam Graham was a woman.\nShe admitted that saying Bryson was a rapist did not \u2018cut any ice\u2019 and made her look \u2018weak and evasive\u2019 and unable to \u2018stand behind the logical conclusion of the self-identification system we had just legislated for\u2019.\nNicola Sturgeon admits she 'lost the dressing room' over her stance on gender ideology\nJK Rowling wore a T-shirt calling Nicola Sturgeon a 'destroyer of women's rights'\n\u2018In football parlance, I lost the dressing room,\u2019 she wrote. \u2018From then on, I was on the defensive.\u2019\nShe hit out at feminist JK Rowling and tried to suggest that the Harry Potter author\u2019s attacks \u2018resulted in more abuse, of a much more vile nature, than I had ever encountered before\u2019 and also \u2018made me feel less safe and more at risk of possible physical harm\u2019.\nBut Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay said: \u2018Frankly, Nicola Sturgeon must be delusional if she thinks the women of Scotland will swallow this drivel.\nThe SNP MSP went on to claim the controversy around her attempt to force through controversial gender reforms as \u2018one of the most bruising episodes\u2019 of her political career.\nWhile she said she should have paused the legislation, she also stepped up more attacks on those who opposed it.\nThe SNP Government\u2019s Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill had proposed removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria for those applying for a gender recognition certificate, and lowered the minimum age to 16.\nIt triggered a major backlash amid concerns about the lack of protection for women\u2019s single-sex spaces like changing rooms and toilets, triggered the biggest rebellion of SNP MSPs during her leadership and was eventually struck down by the UK Government because of concerns about its impact on UK-wide equalities legislation.\nClaiming some had another agenda, Ms Sturgeon said: \u2018There are many examples I could cite, but the one that attracted most attention, not surprisingly, was JK Rowling\u2019s donning of a T-shirt bearing the slogan \u201cSturgeon, destroyer of women\u2019s rights\u201d.\nTransgender double rapist Isla Bryson, formerly known as Adam Graham\n\u2018I obviously don\u2019t know what her intentions were, but it seems blindingly obvious that a stunt like that was never going to elevate the debate or illuminate the issues at the heart of it.\n\u2018The trans debate was one of the most bruising episodes of my time in politics.\u2019\nShe claimed that she received so much vitriol, which she said is often \u2018deeply misogynist\u2019, over gender reform,\nShe said: \u201cit was deeply ironic that those who subjected me to this level of hatred and misogynistic abuse often claimed to be doing so in the interests of women\u2019s safety, to be the standard-bearers of feminism. Nothing feels further from the truth than that.\u2019\nShe also claimed that it \u2018resulted in more abuse, of a much more vile nature, than I had ever encountered before\u2019 and \u201cat risk of possible physical harm\u2019.\nAsh Regan, who resigned her ministeral post for community safety over the issue, said last night the ex FM had been well warned.\nMs Regan said: \u2018I, along with others, warned Nicola and her government advisors privately, publicly and repeatedly that the GRR Bill, as drafted, carried serious risks for women and children. Those concerns were not rooted in prejudice, but in evidence, safeguarding principles and the lived realities of vulnerable women. Instead of listening, she chose to ignore those warnings, press ahead, and frame all dissent as bad faith.\n\u2018I resigned my ministerial role on principle because I could not, in good conscience, support legislation that opened the door to lobby-led ideology over robust safeguarding. Yes, my ministerial resignation put a target on my back; from that moment on, \u2018I faced relentless isolation and hostility - not only in politics but in the public sphere, particularly online.\u2019\nDuring an interview on ITV News broadcast last night, Ms Sturgeon claimed that anyone like Bryson who rapes a woman \u2018forfeit\u2019 the right to be a woman.\nWhen pressed about the comment, she admitted it \u2018was not the best phrase to use\u2019.\nLooking back to the gender reform debate, she said: \u2018We\u2019d lost all sense of rationality in this debate. I\u2019m partly responsible for that.\u2019\nScottish Conservative leader Mr Findlay added: \u2018She arrogantly ignored all warnings that gender self-ID would be a gift to male predators like Isla Bryson. And she ordered her SNP MSPs to vote down my attempts to block rapists and other sex criminals from being able to legally change their gender by self-declaration.\n\u2018Her absurd ideological belief in self-ID collapses with her belated mealy-mouthed admission that this rapist is a man, but she still can\u2019t bring herself to say sorry for all the pain and misery she has caused.'"

  "argos_summary": "Nicola Sturgeon has recently acknowledged the divisive nature of her gender reforms in her upcoming memoir, 'Frankly', while still refraining from fully disavowing the policy. She admits to losing the public's support over the controversial handling of transgender issues, particularly in the case of Isla Bryson, a transgender rapist, and has faced backlash for her perceived lack of accountability. Critics argue that her memoir is more about self-justification than genuine reflection on her political legacy, which they claim is marked by failures in governance and a culture of secrecy within the SNP.",
