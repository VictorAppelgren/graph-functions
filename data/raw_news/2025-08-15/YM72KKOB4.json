  "content": "London Police Department hosted the latest session of its Citizen\u2019s Police Academy last Thursday at the London\u2013Laurel County Rescue Squad \u2014 focusing on DUI enforcement, field sobriety testing and traffic stop tactics.\n\nThe class, again led by Public Information Officer Hobie Daugherty, began with a safety briefing outlining training rules, including the use of Simunition guns \u2014 non-lethal training rounds \u2014 and emergency procedures.\n\nParticipants learned why traffic stops are conducted such as promoting safe driving for motorists, pedestrians, and citizens; locating wanted persons; seizing illegal substances; and recovering stolen property. Also reviewed was the legal grounds for initiating a stop, including speeding, equipment violations, registration issues, and reasonable suspicion of a crime. Instruction also covered tactical approaches, vehicle positioning, communication techniques, and safety practices during stops.\n\nThe DUI (driving under the influence) segment explained that someone can be arrested for impaired driving any time they consume any substance that impairs their ability to operate a vehicle. This includes alcohol, prescription medication, over-the-counter medicines or even certain household products.\n\nOfficers demonstrated Standard Field Sobriety Tests including Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus, where officers observe eye movements for signs of impairment; Walk and Turn, a walking balance test to observe coordination and adherence to instructions; and One Leg Stand, a stationary balance test noting swaying, use of arms for balance, or putting a foot down.\n\nParticipants were also introduced to A.R.I.D.E. (Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement), a 16-hour course for officers to identify impairment clues not always revealed in standard tests. Demonstrations included the lack of convergence test for marijuana impairment, the Modified Romberg Balance Test to assess altered perception of time, and the finger-to-nose divided attention test.\n\nThe session concluded with mock traffic stops based on real-life scenarios. Situations included encountering a sovereign citizen who refused to exit the vehicle, a suspected drunk driver, a \u201csuicide by cop\u201d attempt, and other challenging stops that tested participants\u2019 ability to assess threats, communicate effectively, and make decisions on whether to give a warning, make an arrest, or shoot.",
