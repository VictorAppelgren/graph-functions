      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Causal Chain Tightening**  \n   - Remove the sentence “Mortgage rates, which are currently anchored at 6.5‑7.0 % as the 10‑year trades 4.20‑4.30 %, are also a downstream indicator of the Fed’s stance and feed into the DXY through expectations of future dollar strength (97MD1FHW8)(LF0UUL917).”  \n     *Why*: Mortgage rates are a lagging, indirect proxy; the link to DXY is weak and not directly cited.  \n   - Replace with a concise statement: “The 10‑yr yield (4.23 %) directly drives the term‑premium component of the DXY; a 25‑bp Fed cut would compress the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread by ~30 bp, lowering the DXY by ~30 bp (Z7O1DCHS7)(7XH2DKEKV).”\n\n2. **Quantify Impact of Catalysts**  \n   - Add a bullet: “If the August 30 PCE exceeds 3.0 % (vs. 2.9 % forecast), market‑implied DXY lift ≈ +70 bp; if NFP beats expectations by >200 k, lift ≈ +50 bp.”  \n     *Cite*: (7XH2DKEKV) for PCE/NFP sensitivity.  \n   - Clarify the 200 bp decline: “Market pricing today implies a 200 bp fall to 95.8 by Aug 31, driven by an 86 % probability of a 25‑bp Fed cut and a 57‑bp steepening of the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread (Z7O1DCHS7)(7XH2DKEKV).”\n\n3. **Remove Redundant/Generic Sentences**  \n   - Delete “The primary risk to the base case is a Fed policy reversal or a surprise tightening that would steepen the curve and further depress the DXY; such a reversal would also raise mortgage rates and reinforce the negative bias on the dollar (7XH2DKEKV).”  \n     *Why*: Risk already covered; sentence repeats same idea.  \n   - Condense risk paragraph to: “Key risks: a Fed policy reversal steepening the curve, or a sudden drop in inflation expectations lifting the DXY.”\n\n4. **Explicitly Map to Canonical Handle**  \n   - Add: “DXY → dxy (USD index) – sign: negative; magnitude: –200 bp (base) with ±70 bp swing from PCE/NFP.”  \n     *Cite*: (Z7O1DCHS7)(7XH2DKEKV).\n\n5. **Add Watch‑List Structure**  \n   - Replace the long narrative with a concise watch‑list:  \n     ```\n     • DXY: 95.8 (Aug 31) ±70 bp (PCE/NFP)  \n     • 2‑yr/10‑yr spread: 57 bp (steepening) → DXY ↓30 bp  \n     • Fed minutes (Sep 1): cut vs. hold  \n     • PCE Aug 30: >3.0 % → DXY ↑70 bp  \n     • NFP Aug 31: >200 k above forecast → DXY ↑50 bp\n     ```\n   - Each item should include a short causal link and citation.\n\n6. **Citation Density & Correctness**  \n   - Ensure every claim has an inline ID. For example, replace “Fed’s tightening stance is reflected in the 10‑year Treasury yield” with “Fed’s tightening stance is reflected in the 10‑yr yield (4.23 %) after a 2.3‑bp rise on July PCE (LF0UUL917)(U21K4ALYQ).”\n\n7. **Remove Drift**  \n   - The sentence “The 10‑yr yield (4.23 %) after a 2.3‑bp rise on the July PCE release, reflecting the Fed’s tightening stance and balance‑sheet contraction that keep the real‑rate differential high and inflation expectations above target (LF0UUL917)(U21K4ALYQ).” is fine.  \n   - Any mention of “mortgage rates” or “30‑year fixed‑rate mortgage rate” should be omitted unless directly tied to DXY with a citation.\n\n**Resulting Structure**  \n- Start with a one‑sentence thesis: “DXY is expected to fall ~200 bp to 95.8 by Aug 31, driven by an 86 % chance of a 25‑bp Fed cut and a 57‑bp steepening of the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread.”  \n- Follow with a watch‑list table, each line containing handle, sign, magnitude, catalyst window, and citation.  \n- End with a brief risk paragraph citing (7XH2DKEKV) and (LF0UUL917).  \n\nThis revision meets the acceptance gate: clear handle mapping (dxy), explicit sign/magnitude, dated catalyst windows (Aug 30/31 releases), and concise, defensible, actionable language.",
