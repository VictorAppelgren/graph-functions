  "content": "A federal appeals court found Tuesday that banning child sex changes does not violate parents\u2019 rights, days after another court came to the same conclusion.\n\nThe full Eight Circuit Court of Appeals reversed an injunction blocking Arkansas\u2019 ban on sex changes procedures for minors Tuesday in an 8-2 decision. Oklahoma\u2019s ban was likewise upheld by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals on Aug. 6.\n\nBoth cases cite the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in United States v. Skrmetti, which found Tennessee\u2019s similar law did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. The appeals courts went further by rejecting parental rights claims not addressed in the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling.
