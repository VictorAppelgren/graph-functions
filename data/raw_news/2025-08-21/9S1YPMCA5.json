  "description": "Longtime KROQ host Nicole Alvarez confirms her exit from the station after more than 22 years in an emotional letter: 'Leaving KROQ is the hardest thing I have ever done,' she writes.",
  "content": "Radio personality Nicole Alvarez tells supporters in an emotional farewell letter, \u201cLeaving KROQ is the hardest thing I have ever done.\u201d\n\nRadio personality Nicole Alvarez is leaving KROQ-FM (106.7) behind, after more than 20 years of service and alleged tensions with the station\u2019s executive team.\n\nAlvarez confirmed her departure from the station on Wednesday with a post on Instagram and a farewell letter published by the Hollywood Reporter. She spoke about her exit weeks after delivering her final broadcast on July 30. She joined the KROQ team in September 2003 and was an on-air personality for weekday programming.\n\n\u201cI never knew how it would end. I just knew that when it did, I would have to be the one to write the final chapter,\u201d Alvarez wrote for THR.\n\nAlvarez said she did not intend for the late July broadcast to be her last, writing it was a moment \u201cthat was emotional, frenzied, and irreversible.\u201d She added she made the abrupt exit after a \u201cheated exchange\u201d with her boss. Though she did not share further information about that conversation, Alvarez underlined that her departure is rooted in \u201csomething much larger.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeaving KROQ is the hardest thing I have ever done,\u201d Alvarez said. The station specializes in alternative rock and has long been a platform for notable acts including Nirvana, U2 and Depeche Mode, as Alvarez notes in her letter. During her tenure, Alvarez has also platformed groups including Linkin Park, Muse, the Smashing Pumpkins and Mumford & Sons.\n\nShe added: \u201cStaying would have been a slow death. After being disrespected by an executive known to do those type of things, I was done.\u201d\n\nAlvarez, who said she would \u201cnever speak ill\u201d of her longtime station, did not write any more of the alleged disrespect. A spokesperson for Audacy, which owns KROQ and several other stations across Southern California, did not comment to The Times.\n\nFor Alvarez, her departure from KROQ was more about \u201cwhat radio has become\u201d and \u201cthe way business is handled these days.\u201d Alvarez resigned after refusing an offer for a contract extension, The Times has learned.\n\nShe lamented an alleged shift in the station\u2019s role in the music community over the years, writing that \u201cit has now become a spreadsheet\u201d and that its \u201ccaretakers\u201d are more motivated by professional milestones, and \u201cnot passion.\u201d Alvarez emphasized her loyalty to KROQ and reflected on her time informing listeners about major news events and the music that hit the airwaves.\n\nAs she moves, Alvarez wrote that the station has a chance to return to its roots.\n\n\u201cKROQ still has a chance to remember who it is, what made it \u2018world famous.\u2019 To take risks again. To matter,\u201d she added. \u201cBut it will require courage, not cowardice. Passion, not corporate approval.\u201d\n\nIn her letter, Alvarez thanked those involved in her tenure, ranging from her \u201choly trinity\u201d of colleagues (KROQ alumni Kevin Weatherly, Lisa Worden and Gene Sandbloom), to listeners and artists.\n\n\u201cRadio will always matter. In the right hands, it will always matter,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAlvarez also offered a stern but hopeful message to the executives she accuses of \u201csuffocating\u201d radio: \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to introduce humanity into the corporate narrative. I challenge you to play the game without selling your souls.\u201d\n\nOn Instagram, Alvarez said she has been waiting for a moment to pursue a new chapter and the shift in her radio duties \u201cdidn\u2019t feel right.\u201d She said that her devotion to music will remain, even with her KROQ days behind her.\n\n\u201cNow, with all my energy and all my passion, I can spend another lifetime championing it in new and bigger ways,\u201d she told her followers.",

Kid Rock crashes out over Gavin Newsom\u2019s endorsement joke\n- Share via\nWhether it\u2019s leaning into AI-generated images or President Trump\u2019s signature all-caps style, Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s social media accounts have been firing left and right in recent weeks.\nYour morning catch up: Newsom\u2019s redistricting scheme, short-term home rentals are dropping in L.A. and more big stories.\nThe latest target? None other than rock \u2019n\u2019 roll figure and avid Trump supporter Kid Rock.\nIn a post on Sunday to X, Newsom\u2019s official account shared an AI-generated image of the rock-rapper, whose legal name is Robert James Ritchie. In it, he wears his finest Uncle Sam garb and points at viewers, issuing a statement: \u201cKid Rock wants YOU to support Gavin Newsom.\u201d\nText mimicking the social media style that President Trump has become known for accompanied the post: \u201cI ACCEPT! \u2014 GCN.\u201d\nThe 54-year-old artist waited less than an hour to respond, quickly clearing up that he did not, in fact, support the California governor.\n\u201cThe only support Gavin Newscum will ever get out of me is from ...,\u201d he wrote, and ended his statement by referencing a portion of his anatomy.\nOn Monday, the press office account would respond by stating, \u201cI HATE KID ROCK !!! \u2014 GCN.\u201d Some users suspected that it was an allusion to President Trump\u2019s use of an AI Taylor Swift endorsement in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election.\nIn September 2024, Trump wrote \u201cI accept!\u201d over a series of AI-generated images of Swift fans posted to his own social media site Truth Social. The post used a fake image of Swift wearing Uncle Sam\u2019s signature attire.\nOn Tuesday, Newsom\u2019s account continued the bit. The post on X said, \u201cHAS ANYONE NOTICED THAT SINCE I SAID \u201cI HATE KID ROCK\u201d HE\u2019S NO LONGER \u2018HOT?\u2019 \u2014 GCN.\u201d\nThere\u2019s been no response \u2014 yet."

      "text": "- Share via\nYesi Ortiz has been chasing a sense of home ever since her mixed-status family was forced to bounce between Southern California, Las Vegas and Baja California, Mexico.\nNow, the former radio host of L.A.\u2019s hip-hop station Power 106-FM and cast member of VH1 series \u201cLove & Hip Hop: Hollywood\u201d is building that home herself \u2014 by transforming a Historic South-Central food hall with a Michelin-star pedigree into a DIY concert venue. There, she hosts what\u2019s known simply as \u201cThe Rehearsal.\u201d\n(Because it must be said: No, it\u2019s not related to Nathan Fielder\u2019s HBO series of the same name.)\nThe Rehearsal, which opened its sixth season last month at Mercado La Paloma, is a live showcase for young musical talent hoping to be seen and for seasoned musicians who want to try out new material in front of an audience. It\u2019s also streamed live on Twitch and YouTube each Friday night.\nOrtiz and her team describe it as the kind of show \u201cyou go to find the real ones before they break.\u201d\n\u201cI love the Tiny Desk comparison because that\u2019s what Tiny Desk used to be: a place to find undiscovered talent,\u201d Rehearsal co-founder Levi Downey explained. \u201cI still love it, but it\u2019s not that anymore.\u201d Downey said NPR Music\u2019s flagship video series has increasingly catered more to established talent, like gospel singer Marvin Sapp, and superstars such as Bad Bunny, Sabrina Carpenter and Billie Eilish.\n\u201cEl Tiny\u201d completed its third annual takeover of NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk concert series during Latinx Heritage Month. Produced by the Alt.Latino team, \u201cEl Tiny\u201d featured eight acts from various corners of the Latino community.\nFor Ortiz, the Rehearsal represents something even deeper: a culmination of decades spent navigating survival, sacrifice and ambition.\n\u201cI spent a lot of my life basically chasing jobs because I had a family to take care of,\u201d recalled Ortiz, who adopted her seven nieces and nephews when she was in her early 20s. \u201cI had seven kids, my mom, my sister, my brother, my stepdad and my dad, who was in a nursing care facility, who all depended on me. If I need to go work a red carpet so I can get a check, I\u2019m making that happen. If I need to move to Tijuana, I\u2019m making that happen.\u201d\nAfter almost 20 years raising a family while hosting radio shows, reality shows, talk shows and red carpets, Ortiz said the Rehearsal finally feels like she\u2019s gotten to where she was meant to be. \u201cI love music,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to represent my community. I want to represent my people, and that\u2019s all I want to do. I get to do that with [the Rehearsal].\u201d\nAccording to Ortiz, the idea to create a space for \u201creal ones\u201d was born in the spring of 2022 as a counter to L.A.\u2019s notoriously predatory \u201cpay-to-play\u201d live music scene. Pay-to-play is a custom where fledgling artists are given a set number of tickets they have for pre-sale in order to perform at a venue. Any tickets they don\u2019t sell come out of the artists\u2019 own pocket.\nIn these kinds of deals, artists hardly get a share in any ticket sales.\n\u201cI was managing this musician and she was like, \u2018I just want to perform onstage,\u2019\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cBut the way live music in L.A. works for up-and-coming artists is you have to essentially pay venues to perform there.\u201d\nOrtiz partnered with music producer David Tam to turn her Boyle Heights backyard into a showcase for undiscovered talent. \u201cThat first show was a disaster,\u201d she recalled. Yet from that show, Ortiz and Tam connected with like-minded musicians, such as Downey and Shani Gaines-Bernard, the niece of disco legend Donna Summer, to create the Rehearsal.\n\u201cIt feels like a watering hole,\u201d Gaines-Bernard said. \u201cArtists come to [the Rehearsal] to drink and to showcase their stuff. Industry people who are looking for new artists come to this watering hole to discover that. There are people that come because they love the vibe. Everyone\u2019s coming to be nourished from this watering hole.\u201d\nIn the summer of 2023, Ortiz and her team partnered with Mercado La Paloma to premiere the revamped Rehearsal.\nIn 2024, Mercado La Paloma became best known for its Michelin-star-winning ceviche counter Holbox \u2014 and rightly so. Chef Gilberto Cetina Jr. and his brigade of talented line cooks make an uni-topped ceviche tostada that make the finest caviar blinis seem like Cheese Whiz on Ritz crackers.\nBut Ortiz pointed out that Mercado La Paloma has always been a place to find community. The Mercado was founded some 30 years ago by Mexican immigrants who missed the beloved open-air markets of their hometowns. These days \u2014 at least on Friday nights \u2014 the space offers musicians an equitable spotlight.\nOrtiz is no stranger to chasing stardom herself. After moonlighting in the music world while working full time as a nurse, Ortiz got her first break hosting a Latin hip-hop show in Las Vegas, then worked stints on music radio stations in Tijuana and San Diego. She eventually landed a hit show on Power 106-FM, L.A.\u2019s No. 1 hip-hop station; for several years, Ortiz led the midday airwaves with her \u201cNew at Two\u201d segment, where she would introduce new music from established artists and underground artists that had not broken into the mainstream yet.\n\u201cMy first day on Power, the music director comes in and he\u2019s like, \u2018So I know it\u2019s your first day. Congratulations. You\u2019re interviewing Sean Paul in 10 minutes.\u2019\u201d Ortiz recalled. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wait, what? Hold on!\u2019\u201d\nBeyond the drink slinging and backstabbing romances, VH1\u2019s \u201cLove & Hip Hop\u201d remains one of the most popular reality franchises. How it went from frothy guilty pleasure to pop culture phenomenon and introducer of Cardi B.\nShe parlayed her radio success into TV notoriety, starring in the first season of \u201cLove & Hip Hop\u201d and hosting an entertainment segment on \u201cThe Talk.\u201d Ortiz said she was on a mission to be \u201cthe female Ryan Seacrest, because he had lots of jobs.\u201d\nYet these days, she is much more comfortable working with her team to foster the next generation of talent with the Rehearsal. And she hopes it grows to multiple venues, cities and even countries.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the goal. Just to make a bigger space for more artists. But without losing the intimacy of it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe like how it\u2019s small and mighty. But hopefully we can scale that organically.\u201d"

      "text": "Corp. for Public Broadcasting shuts down after federal funding cuts\n- Share via\nThe Corp. for Public Broadcasting said Friday it was shutting down, a week after President Trump signed legislation stripping its funding.\nThe move startled some public radio and television station managers throughout the country. Many had only begun to absorb the shock of losing federal support and were quickly figuring out ways to keep their stations vibrant.\nThe Corp. for Public Broadcasting administers funds for PBS TV affiliates and NPR radio stations \u2014 more than 1,500 local television and radio stations nationwide.\nIn a statement, the group said it would \u201cbegin an orderly wind-down of its operations.\u201d A majority of staff positions will be cut Sept. 30, when the group\u2019s fiscal year ends and \u201ca small transition team will remain through January,\u201d it said.\n\u201cThis reflects the devastating impacts on public broadcasting,\u201d said Andrew Russell, PBS SoCal chief executive. \u201cCPB provides funding to local stations, it provides funding to national programming, and it has played a leadership role in public broadcasting since its inception. These are all real losses.\u201d\nSince returning to office, Trump has made a priority of yanking federal funding from public broadcasters as part of a wider campaign against media outlets that he dislikes. The president derided PBS and NPR as government-funded \u201cleft-wing propaganda.\u201d Congress fell into line.\nConservatives have long wanted to strip funding from public media because of what they perceive to be liberal bias.\nLawmakers passed a \u201crescission\u201d measure in mid-July, largely along party lines, that canceled $1.1 billion previously allocated for public broadcasting for two years.\n\u201cThere was no offramp,\u201d said Ken Siebert, general manager of Yellowstone Public Radio in Billings, Mont. \u201cThat money had already been appropriated. It wasn\u2019t like they came and said: \u2018OK, you\u2019ve got two more years to figure out how you\u2019re going to prepare for this revenue shortfall and these additional expenses.\u2019 It was just, \u2018Nope.\u2019\u201d\nSeparately, lawmakers introduced a Senate appropriations bill for 2026 that excludes funding for the Corp. for Public Broadcasting for the first time in more than 50 years.\nThe actions left the public broadcasting group without a steady source of operating money \u2014 and little hope that more would be on the way.\n\u201cThat appears to have been the last straw,\u201d said Kliff Kuehl, chief executive of Kansas City PBS. His station is losing $1.8 million, or about 13% of its television budget and 9% of its financing for its radio operation. \u201cIt\u2019s tough.\u201d\nNPR and PBS outlets, including several in Southern California, will have to make tough decisions as the U.S. Senate votes to claw back money previously allocated for their operations.\nCorp. for Public Broadcasting Chief Executive Patricia Harrison said in a statement: \u201cDespite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations.\u201d\nThe organization dates back nearly 60 years and has helped nurture such notable programs as \u201cSesame Street,\u201d \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d \u201cNova,\u201d numerous Ken Burns documentaries and \u201cAntiques Roadshow.\u201d It also supported \u201cMister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood,\u201d distributing educational children\u2019s programming that has long helped fill an important gap in the market. It has fortified such NPR programs as \u201cMorning Edition\u201d and \u201cAll Things Considered.\u201d\nThrough its partnerships with local stations and producers, the nonprofit made a mission of supporting educational and cultural programming, local journalism and emergency communications.\nThe move could cripple smaller public stations, including those in rural areas that struggle to mount high-dollar local membership campaigns.\n\u201cOften, the only local media in some of these really small markets is public broadcasting,\u201d said Kuehl, who has worked in public broadcasting for two decades and seen previous funding cut threats come and go.\n\u201cI would always tell our members of Congress: \u2018Hey, if you do this, you\u2019re not going to get rid of L.A. or New York, Chicago, Dallas or Kansas City. You\u2019re going to get rid of Smoky Hills, Kansas, and Redding, California,\u2019\u201d Kuehl said.\nYellowstone Public Radio is losing more than 13% of its budget, or about $350,000 a year \u2014 money that helped provide a small newsroom for its far-flung listener base, an enormous swath of northern Wyoming and Montana stretching to the Canadian border.\n\u201cPeople tend to think about this as just NPR, and PBS, but the heart of it is about the member stations, the people who live and work in the communities,\u201d Siebert said. \u201cWe tailor our programming for the specific arts and culture and educational needs of our listeners \u2014 old-school programming ... news and information, classical music, jazz, bluegrass, blues.\u201d\nPBS SoCal, which operates member stations KOCE and KCET in Orange and Los Angeles counties, respectively, was set to lose more than $4 million in federal funding, Russell, president and chief executive of the stations, previously told The Times.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some of our viewers and funders starting to step up [with donations], but it won\u2019t completely replace that [CPB] funding,\u201d Russell said. \u201cPBS SoCal will continue and public broadcasting will endure, but the system that we\u2019ve known will be different going forward.\u201d\nCongress passed the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to cancel federal funding previously allocated for public media, which media leaders say will have devastating consequences.\nNPR has two large affiliates serving Los Angeles: KCRW-FM (89.9) and LAist/KPCC-FM (89.3).\nLAist, based in Pasadena, will lose about 4% of its annual budget \u2014 $1.7 million. Alejandra Santamaria, the station\u2019s chief executive, told The Times last month that funding helped pay for 13 journalist positions in its newsroom.\nKCRW in Santa Monica had been expecting $1.3 million from the Corp. for Public Broadcasting.\nThe stations have asked listeners to donate to compensate for the shortfall. But the station managers said they worried that listener and viewer pledge drives may not be enough to sustain stations and their small newsrooms over the long haul without the funding.\n\u201cEven if you make some of these things dormant, there\u2019s permanent damage,\u201d Kuehl, the Kansas City broadcaster, said. \u201cSome of these stations will get sold, others will shut down. How do you put back together a system that serves 99% of the country again? It\u2019s a real shame.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\nHollywood put up decent numbers this summer and we\u2019d be lying if we told you we didn\u2019t find much to like (even if it didn\u2019t always come in a cape). But just as inevitably as the warm months wane, ambitious actors will attempt to play rock icons. Accents will be summoned, some of them mastered. Epic musicals involving witches, wicked or otherwise, will find their conclusions. Oscar winners will play Nazis. Jared Leto will continue to do what only Jared Leto does. Pathos will be mined from the tale of a wrestler. These are the things we expect from a robust fall season and the upcoming one will not disappoint. Here\u2019s what our staff is most anticipating.\n\u2018The Long Walk\u2019 (Sept. 12)\nIn a near-future America ruled by a totalitarian regime (ah, the movies), several young men take part in a nationally televised endurance contest with one brutal rule: Stop walking and you die. Adapted from Stephen King\u2019s novel first published under his Richard Bachman alias in 1979, \u201cThe Long Walk\u201d is directed by \u201cHunger Games\u201d veteran Francis Lawrence, who knows his way around dystopian survival stories. The march heads toward an ending only one contestant can reach, with Cooper Hoffman (\u201cLicorice Pizza\u201d) among the participants and Mark Hamill in villain mode as the implacable Major overseeing the ordeal. The contest unfolds in broad daylight as cameras and soldiers turn the asphalt into an arena. Adaptations of King books have been around for decades, but few promise the kind of slow, creeping dread this premise invites and the political overtones of militarized spectacle are hard to miss. Wear comfortable shoes and hydrate accordingly. \u2014 Josh Rottenberg\n\u2018Eleanor the Great\u2019 (Sept. 26)\nThe award for the most intriguing combo of Hollywood\u2019s fall season has to be Scarlett Johansson and June Squibb. Johansson had a hit this summer with \u201cJurassic Park Rebirth\u201d while the 95-year-old Squibb has repeatedly scored praise for her recent performances, including 2024\u2019s \u201cThelma\u201d in which she played a grandmother seeking revenge after being targeted in a scam. Both are winning accolades for \u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d which marks Johansson\u2019s debut behind the camera as director. Squibb stars as the lonely title character who falsely claims to be a Holocaust survivor, then privately frets as her lie snowballs into something unfixable. The film was an audience favorite at Cannes, ranking among The Times\u2019 10 best films at the festival. \u2014 Greg Braxton\n\u2018One Battle After Another\u2019 (Sept. 26)\nPaul Thomas Anderson, who gave us the oil-soaked intensity of \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d the sleazy excess of \u201cBoogie Nights\u201d and the knotty elegance of \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d is not the obvious choice to direct a big-budget Imax action-thriller, which is exactly why \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d feels like an event. Loosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon\u2019s 1990 novel \u201cVineland,\u201d the film transplants the book\u2019s tangle of political grudges to a modern-day context of former activists forced back together when their long-vanished enemy resurfaces. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a drug-and-booze-addled revolutionary trying to rescue his kidnapped daughter, with Teyana Taylor, Regina Hall and Alana Haim as his comrades, Benicio del Toro as his wild-card ally Sensei Sergio and Sean Penn as their white-nationalist antagonist, Col. Steven J. Lockjaw. Anderson last adapted Pynchon with the loopy, stoner-inflected \u201cInherent Vice,\u201d but here he\u2019s working on a grander scale. Shot on 35mm VistaVision, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will be a rare chance to see Anderson bring his sly digressions, oddball humor and tonal whiplash to a canvas usually reserved for Bayhem. \u2014 Josh Rottenberg\n\u2018Anemone\u2019 (Oct. 3)\nIt\u2019s being described by early marketing as an exploration of bonds between fathers, sons and brothers through \u201cpersonal journeys and generational conflicts,\u201d which honestly could describe 80% of all movies ever. Fortunately, though, plot is not the headline; casting is. \u201dAnemone\u201d has apparently forced Daniel Day-Lewis out of the retirement he announced in 2017. And for a good reason: Day-Lewis co-wrote the film with his son, Ronan Day-Lewis, a New York-based painter who also directs. This will be the second time Day-Lewis the elder has come out of retirement \u2014 he left acting in the late \u201990s, only to return after Martin Scorsese convinced him to do \u201cGangs of New York,\u201d after which he won two more Oscars. (Not to put too much pressure on \u201cAnemone.\u201d) The film also stars Sean Bean, Samuel Bottomley, Safia Oakley-Green and Samantha Morton. \u2014 Mary McNamara\n\u2018The Smashing Machine\u2019 (Oct. 3)\nWhat\u2019s the Rock cooking? Another crafty career pivot from face to heel: specifically, from being the face of too many franchises with too few critical hits, to teaming up with Benny Safdie, one of the beloved bad boys of indie cinema. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d \u2014 Safdie\u2019s first film since \u201cUncut Gems\u201d (which he co-directed with his brother Josh) and Johnson\u2019s most intriguing release since 2013\u2019s underappreciated \u201cPain & Gain\u201d \u2014 stars the former wrestler as MMA fighter Mark Kerr, who won multiple gold medals in the \u201990s and early aughts while getting slammed by the painkiller addiction that enabled him to keep getting back in the ring. Kerr shared his story in a 2002 HBO documentary of the same name. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how (or if) the harsh truth of combat sports gets the manic Safdie treatment. Best-case scenario: No holds will be barred. \u2014 Amy Nicholson\n\u2018After the Hunt\u2019 (Oct. 10)\nItalian director Luca Guadagnino (\u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d \u201cChallengers\u201d) likes erotic stories that flirt with disaster. He tweaks the audience\u2019s moral compass, and \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d sounds like a dangerous spin on his risque business. The #MeToo-adjacent thriller stars Julia Roberts as a college professor who freezes when her favorite student (\u201cThe Bear\u2019s\u201d Ayo Edebiri) lodges an assault accusation against her favorite colleague (Andrew Garfield). Counter-accusations ensue, leaving Roberts\u2019 character unsure whom to believe and paranoid that this blame tsunami will cause her own ethically dubious past to surface. Guadagnino has hinted that he\u2019s interested in teasing out how different people (and generations) disagree on the definition of consent. The early buzz is that Roberts has seized onto the opportunity to deliver her richest performance in ages and it\u2019s worth noting that Guadagnino has yet to win his first Oscar. \u2014 Amy Nicholson\n\u2018A House of Dynamite\u2019 (Oct. 10; on Netflix Oct. 24)\nKathryn Bigelow, the Oscar-winning director behind \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d and \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d is an expert at turning real-world crises into procedural pulse-pounders. In \u201cA House of Dynamite,\u201d she trades the battlefield for the White House, tracking a team of officials scrambling to respond to an incoming-missile alert in near real time. The stacked cast includes Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Jared Harris, Greta Lee, Tracy Letts, Anthony Ramos and Jason Clarke. Shot with you-are-there immediacy by cinematographer Barry Ackroyd and edited by Fincher veteran Kirk Baxter (\u201cThe Social Network\u201d), it\u2019s Bigelow\u2019s first feature in eight years, since her period crime drama \u201cDetroit.\u201d This time, it\u2019s situation rooms, red phones and competing chains of command. The fuse is bureaucratic and the stakes are global. \u2014 Josh Rottenberg\n\u2018If I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You\u2019 (Oct. 10)\nThe most terrifying movie of the year, unsurprisingly, is about a mother just trying to get through a day \u2014 or maybe it\u2019s her whole life? Rose Byrne stars as Linda, a Montauk therapist in an emotional tailspin: she\u2019s tending to a sick daughter with a mystery illness that prevents her from eating normally, there\u2019s a hole in her ceiling that\u2019s gushing water, her husband is MIA and she\u2019s desperate for counsel from her own aloof therapist (Conan O\u2019Brien). Mary Bronstein\u2019s sophomore feature skillfully takes a darkly funny look at the harrowing isolation and chaos of motherhood, often zooming in on Byrne\u2019s face as she\u2019s pushed to the brink. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that rapper ASAP Rocky plays James, an unlikely partner-in-crime with a gnarly internet browser history whom Linda comes to know when her water disaster forces her to move into a motel. The A24 film, which counts Josh Safdie among its producers, earned raves out of this year\u2019s Sundance and critics are already heralding Byrne\u2019s performance as Oscar-worthy. \u2014 Yvonne Villarreal\n\u2018Tron: Ares\u2019 (Oct. 10)\nAI continues to evolve onscreen \u2014 for every Entity threatening the end of civilization in \u201cDead Reckoning,\u201d there\u2019s a M3GAN 2.0 ready to come to our aid with an eye roll. \u201cTron: Ares\u201d looks to split the difference: Mean-looking skyscraper-sized machines face off against Jared Leto. Never mind. You didn\u2019t watch these movies for the plots anyway. Besides the welcome return of a cameoing Jeff Bridges from the 1982 Atari-era landmark, the new movie brings on Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross doing a proper industrial-rock score under their old moniker Nine Inch Nails, a soundtrack they\u2019ve called \u201cgrittier\u201d compared with their other stuff like \u201cChallengers.\u201d That\u2019s reason enough to go, head-bobbing your way through lightcycle race sequences to the groove. A summer movie smuggled into the fall? Fine, we\u2019ll need a few of those, especially as the awards drumbeat gets deafening. \u2014 Joshua Rothkopf\n\u2018Good Fortune\u2019 (Oct. 17)\nDo you remember comedies? Do you remember the experience of going to a movie theater and laughing with a room full of complete strangers? Do you remember Aziz Ansari? \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d yes. But also the charming rom-com Netflix series \u201cMaster of None,\u201d the one that Ansari starred in and co-created, often writing and directing as well. It\u2019s been a minute. Ansari was set to make his feature film directorial debut in 2022, but production was halted and never resumed due to a complaint of inappropriate behavior lodged against Bill Murray. Now we finally have Ansari\u2019s first feature, a comedy about a guardian angel (Keanu Reeves) swapping the lives of a struggling gig worker (Ansari) and his wealthy boss (Seth Rogen). Think of it as \u201cTrading Places\u201d with a dash of Wim Wenders. It could be sublime. It could be a train wreck. But it\u2019s an original story from a multi-hyphenate who was viewed, not that long ago, as a major talent. I\u2019m interested. \u2014 Glenn Whipp\n\u2018It Was Just an Accident\u2019 (Oct. 17)\nAt their boldest, movies can demand a reckoning, a reconsideration. Iran\u2019s Jafar Panahi swept into Cannes with this sad and furious political thriller, about the lingering aftermath of a torture master\u2019s abuses, taking the Palme d\u2019Or in an almost cosmic reversal of fortunes for a filmmaker who has often suffered in prison or under house arrest, his art forbidden. \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d has revealed more to me in thinking about it, especially about the precarity of everyday manners. Without ruining it, the closest comparison is to something like \u201cDeath and the Maiden.\u201d When the tables are turned, is revenge itself a moral dead end? Based on an especially tough-minded piece of writing, this is a film that will get you contemplating pettiness and righteousness both. There\u2019s no fall movie season without the Palme winner and last year\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d went all the way. \u2014 Joshua Rothkopf\n\u2018Bugonia\u2019 (Oct. 24)\nThere is still something astonishing that Greek-born filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos has become as commercially successful and awards-friendly as he has, given that his work tends to be abstract, allegorical and at times willfully off-putting. Nothing if not unpredictable, Lanthimos now offers up a remake of the 2003 South Korean film \u201cSave the Green Planet!\u201d in which a pair of activists kidnap a pharmaceutical executive they believe to be a space alien, with Jesse Plemons as one of the plotters and Emma Stone as their target. Lanthimos\u2019 work often combines dark comedy and an unexpected romantic streak with a potent political charge and his latest film looks to tap into the volatile energy of conspiracy theories and radical anti-corporate sentiments. Stone, who won an Oscar for her performance in Lanthimos\u2019 \u201cPoor Things,\u201d continues to use her Hollywood star power to champion challenging filmmakers. This is their fifth film together. \u2014 Mark Olsen\n\u2018Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere\u2019 (Oct. 24)\nThe cynical take would be: This is a naked attempt at the same commercial success as music-themed dramas like \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201d But Bruce Springsteen and the raw, stripped-down recordings of his 1982 \u201cNebraska\u201d album seem earnestly in opposition to such artless gamesmanship. Adapted and directed by Scott Cooper, the film stars Jeremy Allen White (perfectly suited for a post-\u201cThe Bear\u201d step into movie stardom), along with Jeremy Strong as Springsteen\u2019s faithful manager Jon Landau and additional supporting turns from Paul Walter Hauser, Stephen Graham, Gaby Hoffmann, Odessa Young and Marc Maron. A soulful, searching \u201970s-style character study on the making of a now-classic \u201980s album with some of the most exciting performers of 2025 is both slightly counterintuitive and something that makes total sense. \u2014 Mark Olsen\n\u2018Die My Love\u2019 (Nov. 7)\nThat title seems to have lost a comma since Cannes, but who cares? Director Lynne Ramsay has no patience for grammatical formalities and her latest burns with the punk ferocity of her finest film, 2002\u2019s \u201cMorvern Callar.\u201d Ramsay has found a fellow traveler in Jennifer Lawrence, who, these days post-\u201cCauseway,\u201d is reinventing herself in a focused, fearless register. It\u2019s impossible to watch \u201cDie My Love\u201d and not be hypnotized by its swampy psychodrama: the violent postpartum death throes of a marriage that has little reason to continue. Lawrence and her co-star, Robert Pattinson, play a city couple who move to Montana only half-believing in their own future together. Ramsay teases out something delicate and distracted in both of them. You\u2019ll hear about these sex scenes. There\u2019s more to the movie than that. \u2014 Joshua Rothkopf\n\u2018Nuremberg\u2019 (Nov. 7)\nIn November 1945, two dozen high-ranking officials of the Nazi Party were charged with crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity. At their center was Hermann G\u00f6ring, Adolf Hitler\u2019s second-in-command. Not surprisingly, G\u00f6ring is a central character in the upcoming James Vanderbilt film \u201cNuremberg.\u201d Based on Jack El-Hai\u2019s 2013 book \u201cThe Nazi and the Psychiatrist,\u201d \u201cNuremberg\u201d focuses on the relationship between G\u00f6ring, played by Russell Crowe, and Douglas Kelley (Rami Malek), the psychiatrist tasked with determining if G\u00f6ring and the other Nuremberg defendants were capable of standing trial. Though in hindsight G\u00f6ring\u2019s conviction seems inevitable, many of the Allied leaders had initially preferred summary execution to prevent the Nazis from gaining any kind of sympathy. Bombastic, unrepentant, with a ribald sense of humor and a defense that leaned heavily into his desire to make Germany great again, G\u00f6ring came out swinging. It is difficult to imagine an actor better suited to this role than Crowe, just as Malek seems a perfect fit for Kelley, who never recovered from his discovery that the Nazis \u201cwere no different from a group of intelligent executives anywhere.\u201d \u2014 Mary McNamara\n\u2018Predator: Badlands\u2019 (Nov. 7)\nDirector Dan Trachtenberg rejuvenated the \u201cPredator\u201d franchise with his 2022 prequel \u201cPrey,\u201d a period piece that pitted a ferocious young Comanche warrior (Amber Midthunder) against a new iteration of the iconic alien hunter while also weaving in conflict with terrestrial interlopers. I\u2019ve been ready for Trachtenberg\u2019s next offering from this world ever since. While \u201cPrey\u201d was set during Earth\u2019s past, \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d moves the action to a remote planet in the future. There are no human protagonists needed to outmaneuver a deadly alien foe this time around. \u201cBadlands\u201d centers a young Predator outcast (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi) who encounters an android (Elle Fanning) created by the \u201cAlien\u201d franchise\u2019s Weyland-Yutani Corp. while on his quest to hunt the deadliest of beasts. The idea of a Predator and a synthetic\u2019s odd-couple team-up was intriguing even before the visual of an alien warrior carrying half an android on his back grabbed this \u201cStar Wars\u201d fan\u2019s attention. \u2014 Tracy Brown\n\u2018Sentimental Value\u2019 (Nov. 7)\nAs the follow-up to their breakthrough collaboration on \u201cThe Worst Person in the World,\u201d Norwegian filmmaker Joachim Trier and actor Renate Reinsve return with \u201cSentimental Value,\u201d which won the second-place Grand Prix award when it premiered at Cannes earlier this year. In a richly layered study of family, legacy and nothing less than the purpose of art, Reinsve plays an emotionally fragile actor whose filmmaker father (a galvanizing Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) has written a part for her. After she refuses to even consider it, feeling that the baggage between them is too fraught, he moves on to casting an American ingenue (Elle Fanning), who may not be up to the demands of the role. (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas as Reinsve\u2019s sister is also something of the film\u2019s sneaky secret weapon.) Able to switch moods and tones with a stylish, skillful ease, Trier brings out the best in all the film\u2019s performers, mixing a knowing, bittersweet humor with deep insights. \u2014 Mark Olsen\n\u2018Train Dreams\u2019 (Nov. 7, on Netflix Nov. 21)\nDid we dream it at Sundance? A classically proportioned drama about the building of the American West, mostly seen from the eyes of one logger, that approaches the quiet grandeur of a Terrence Malick movie? Nope, \u201cTrain Dreams\u201d is here and there\u2019s something about its poise and intimacy that makes it feel, finally, like Netflix has a big awards winner, provided viewers can get beyond Joel Edgerton\u2019s bushy beard. The performance is taciturn and nonverbal; he\u2019s got a mouthpiece in Will Patton\u2019s folksy narration, but what Edgerton is doing is worth leaning in for, complex and fascinating. Co-written by Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar, the team behind \u201cJockey\u201d and \u201cSing Sing,\u201d and adapted from Denis Johnson\u2019s 2011 novella, this gorgeous movie could put you in mind of a less frenetic era and also, via its piney fog-shrouded exteriors, of the country that still exists beyond all our noise. \u2014 Joshua Rothkopf\n\u2018Jay Kelly\u2019 (Nov. 14; on Netflix Dec. 5)\nAn aging movie star reflects back on his life and career, contemplating what it was all for as he heads to Europe to receive a lifetime achievement award. The new \u201cJay Kelly\u201d stars George Clooney but is also in some ways about George Clooney \u2014 or at least the kind of existential crisis that only someone like George Clooney could truly understand. The latest film directed by Noah Baumbach, who co-wrote the screenplay with Emily Mortimer, \u201cJay Kelly\u201d may also be full of the filmmaker\u2019s own inner ruminations following the dismissive response to 2022\u2019s \u201cWhite Noise,\u201d his previous film, and the overwhelming success of \u201cBarbie,\u201d which he co-wrote with Greta Gerwig. The stacked cast of \u201cJay Kelly\u201d includes Adam Sandler, Laura Dern, Billy Crudup, Riley Keough, Stacy Keach, Jim Broadbent, Mortimer and Gerwig. Baumbach\u2019s signature serio-comic touch, in which the humor lacerates as much as the drama, should be in full effect here. \u2014 Mark Olsen\n\u2018The Running Man\u2019 (Nov. 14)\nSeven years ago, a movie fan tweeted at director Edgar Wright to ask if he\u2019d ever helm a remake. \u201cThe Running Man,\u201d Wright replied \u2014 and now he\u2019s done just that. Prescience has always been part of this action-thriller\u2019s hold on the imagination. Stephen King dreamed up the idea of a deadly TV competition in 1982, years before \u201cSurvivor\u201d brought the thrill of watching real-life desperation into our living rooms, and set his dystopian story in the then-distant future of 2025. Today, King\u2019s grim satire doesn\u2019t seem quite as far-fetched, so Wright\u2019s challenge will be making sure his update still packs a wallop. Glen Powell has stepped into Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s running shoes as a gritty, hardscrabble contestant who flees for his life, with Josh Brolin, Colman Domingo, Lee Pace, Michael Cera and Katy O\u2019Brian rounding out the cast. Here\u2019s hoping this long-awaited project makes it across the finish line with panache. \u2014 Amy Nicholson\n\u2018Wicked: For Good\u2019 (Nov. 21)\nIt feels like I\u2019ve been holding space for Part 2 of Jon M. Chu\u2019s musical extravaganza for as long as film star Cynthia Erivo stretched out that final \u201caaaaaaaaaaahhh\u201d battle cry in the showstopping \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d number. Adapted from the long-running Broadway musical, the bifurcated epic is mostly set before \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d and explores the origins of green-skinned Elphaba (Erivo) before she became known as the Wicked Witch of the West and her complex dynamic with rival-turned-friend Glinda (Ariana Grande). The first movie, which introduced the young women as students at Shiz University who developed an unlikely friendship after being forced to bunk together, ended with Elphaba learning about the dark realities of oppression within Oz\u2019s Emerald City and launching onto a path of resistance, quite literally, by taking flight on her getaway broomstick and fleeing the city. This second half will explore the diverging roads the two friends take as they become the adversaries we originally came to know through Dorothy and Co. It\u2019s hard to say which will be more entertaining, the promotional tour or the actual movie. \u2014 Yvonne Villarreal"

      "text": "- Share via\nThis fall, there are more than a few mysteries to be uncovered, whether it\u2019s by a group of retired amateur sleuths, an FBI task force, a group of children living in small-town Maine or the only unhappy woman in the world \u2014 trust us, the last isn\u2019t as dour as it seems (there are donuts). If you would rather stay grounded in reality, streaming documentaries with subjects ranging from Sarah McLachlan to Martin Scorsese to the American Revolution will do just the trick while giving you perspective about the music and film industries and America\u2019s Founding Fathers. But if you prefer to detach and have some laughs, there are several comedies and dramedies that will do just that. And that\u2019s the democratic nature of television \u2014 there\u2019s something for everyone.\n\u2018The Thursday Murder Club\u2019\n(Netflix, Aug. 28)\nThe first of Richard Osman\u2018s wonderful series of novels concerning a group of British retirees who recreationally solve murders has become an almost-straight-to-Netflix feature with a cast that in olden times would have guaranteed a long theatrical ride. Helen Mirren plays Elizabeth, with a background in intelligence; Pierce Brosnan is Ron, a combative ex-trade unionist; Ben Kingsley plays Ibrahim, a shy former psychiatrist; and Celia Imrie is Joyce, the chirpy newcomer, with Naomi Ackie as Donna, the bored police officer who falls under their collective spell. (Plus David Tennant, Richard E. Grant and Jonathan Pryce, if that isn\u2019t enough British thespian firepower for you.) As a fan of the books, I will approach it with some trepidation, but I will absolutely approach it. \u2014 Robert Lloyd\nThe Irish actor stars as an idealistic editor in chief of a Midwest newspaper that he\u2019s trying to revive with the help of his ragtag staff.\n\u2018Task\u2019\n(HBO, Sept. 7)\nCrime dramas are a dime a dozen, but sometimes one stands out from the crowd and keeps you hooked. The latest HBO series from Brad Ingelsby, who famously brought us Kate Winslet in a Delco accent in \u201cMare of Easttown,\u201d may well do that. Like \u201cMare,\u201d it is also set in Pennsylvania, but this time the story revolves around an FBI agent named Tom played by Mark Ruffalo, who is charged with leading a task force to uncover who is behind a string of robberies. Parallel to his story is that of Robbie (Tom Pelphrey) and his best friend Cliff (Ra\u00fal Castillo), sanitation workers who are trying to make ends meet. Secrets, twists and turns lie ahead that bridge their stories together and make you question the gray areas between good, bad, wrong and right. \u2014 Maira Garcia\n\u2018Black Rabbit\u2019\n(Netflix, Sept. 18)\nBetween TV series (\u201cOzark\u201d), films (\u201cCarry-On\u201d), podcasts (\u201cSmartLess\u201d) and commercials (State Farm Insurance), Jason Bateman is one of the busiest performers in Hollywood. He returns to Netflix in a limited series, \u201cBlack Rabbit,\u201d which teams him with Jude Law. The project features Law as Jake Friedkin, the owner of New York\u2019s popular Black Rabbit restaurant and VIP lounge who runs into trouble when his brother Vince (Bateman) returns years after going on the lam after running up a mountain of gambling debts. Bateman also directs the first two episodes, and is an executive producer along with Law. \u2014 Greg Braxton\n\u2018Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery\u2019\n(Hulu, Sept. 21)\nSweet nostalgia. Lilith Fair was the first music festival I ever attended as an awkward, introverted teen, and it was the first time I was surrounded by thousands of (mostly) women who I knew felt absolutely free to be themselves. Of course I\u2019d want to relive that. For those who need a refresher, Lilith Fair was a traveling music festival founded by Sarah McLachlan and others to prove the sexist standards that existed in the music industry in the 1990s were morally and financially wrong. Featuring artists like Sheryl Crow, Liz Phair, Queen Latifah, Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor, the Indigo Girls and many others, the festival made more than 130 stops over its original three-summer run. Directed by Ally Pankiw and touting Dan Levy as one of its producers, \u201cLilith Fair: Building a Mystery\u201d mined over 600 hours of never-before-seen footage and features interviews with the festival\u2019s organizers, musicians and fans. \u2014 Tracy Brown\n\u2018The Lowdown\u2019\n(FX, Sept. 23)\nSterlin Harjo, who last gave us \u201cReservation Dogs,\u201d is back with another Oklahoma-set series, a noir excursion loosely based on citizen journalist Lee Roy Chapman. Ethan Hawke, here called Lee Raybon, is a Tulsa amateur \u201ctruthstorian\u201d and rare book dealer, working and living in a store where the cool people hang out. His yen to cure civic rot in the light of day brings him into the orbit of a powerful family, including a suicide (Tim Blake Nelson), a widow (Jeanne Tripplehorn), and a candidate for governor (Kyle MacLachlan). Kaniehtiio Horn, the Deer Lady on \u201cRez Dogs,\u201d plays his ex-wife because in a show like this, any wife is bound to be an ex, with Ryan Kiera Armstrong as their Nancy Drew of a teenage daughter, and Keith David bringing his formidable Keith David-ness. \u2014 R.L.\nThe creator, writer and director of FX\u2019s \u2018The Lowdown,\u2019 starring Ethan Hawke, is centered on Harjo\u2019s Oklahoma hometown and journalist Lee Roy Chapman.\n\u2018Slow Horses\u2019\nSeason 5 (Apple TV+, Sept. 24)\nThe long, and for some of us agonizing, wait is over for the best spy drama on TV. Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman) and his MI5 Slough House misfits are at it again, bumbling into all manner of international and inner-departmental intrigue, with their signature results of mess and mayhem. Computer-genius man-child Roddy Ho (Christopher Chung) plays a central figure in this year\u2019s race against time, River Cartwright (Jack Lowden) continues to agonize over the plight of his aging grandfather (Jonathan Pryce) and his own determination to get back to the Park, where Second Desk Diana Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas) remains under the authority of twitchily incompetent First Desk Claude Whelan (James Callis, having a grand old time.) Pulling everyone\u2019s strings is, of course, Lamb \u2014 whether goading his assistant Catherine Standish (Saskia Reeves), locking horns with Taverner or talking his way out of virtually any situation, Lamb is the most noisome, flatulent, stringy-haired super spy ever to grace any screen and it is impossible to imagine a world without him. \u2014 Mary McNamara\n\u2018House of Guinness\u2019\n(Netflix, Sept. 25)\nArthur Guinness, the founder of the world\u2019s most iconic beer, had 21 children. Only 10 of them survived to adulthood and only four represent the family in this Netflix series. But in the hands of creator Steven Knight, best known for \u201cPeaky Blinders,\u201d four appear to be quite enough. Following their father\u2019s death, Arthur (Anthony Boyle), Edward (Louis Partridge), Benjamin (Fionn O\u2019Shea) and Anne (Emily Fairn) must navigate all manner of tensions and threats, including the draconian terms of their father\u2019s will, violent Fenian protests (Guinness senior was a Protestant who believed in Catholic rights but not Irish self-rule) and various affairs of the heart \u2014 Anne smolders early on at the sight of brewery overseer Sean Rafferty (James Norton). Many creative liberties were taken, no doubt, but the inevitable \u201cSuccession\u201d meets \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d (by way of \u201cRebellion\u201d) description is apt enough. As the adverts for the black stuff say, it is a lovely day for Guinness. \u2014 M.M.\n\u2018IT: Welcome to Derry\u2019\n(HBO, October)\nYou just can\u2019t put a terrifying clown down. Almost 40 years have passed since Stephen King terrified readers with \u201cIT,\u201d his massive novel about a vicious clown named Pennywise who targets the children of Derry, Maine. A 1990 miniseries and two theatrical films followed. \u201cWelcome to Derry\u201d continues the \u201cIT\u201c-verse as a prequel set in the 1960s before the \u201cIT\u201d and \u201cIT Chapter 2\u201d films. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd reprises his portrayal of Pennywise as the series unveils the origins of the menacing clown, while also spotlighting a group of residents wrestling with their own fears and demons. Andy Muschietti, who directed the \u201cIT\u201d films, helped develop the series and is one of the executive producers. The cast includes Jovan Adepo and Taylour Paige. \u2014 G.B.\n\u2018Boots\u2019\n(Netflix, Oct. 9)\nChoosing to join the military can be construed as a major act of patriotism, but oftentimes it is a very personal decision that involves a lot of a sacrifice \u2014 choices like where you will live, what you do on a day-to-day basis and who you work with are dictated. Enter Cameron Cope (Miles Heizer), a gay, bullied high school graduate who isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s next until his best friend Ray McAffey (Liam Oh) \u2014 the only person he\u2019s come out to \u2014 suggests they join the Marines. Cameron imagines the military to be like summer camp, until reality sets in. This dramedy is set in the \u201890s, when being gay in the military was still grounds for discharge, so not only does Cameron have to endure the brutality of boot camp, he has to keep his sexual orientation a secret. The series is based on \u201cThe Pink Marine,\u201d a memoir by Greg Cope White, who serves as a writer. \u2014 M.G.\n\u2018DMV\u2019\n(CBS, Oct. 13)\nYour local department of motor vehicles may seem like the very last place to get a laugh, but CBS has managed to pull it off. Its new workplace comedy centers on a ragtag group of employees who work at an East Hollywood DMV: Gregg (Tim Meadows), a former English teacher; Colette (Harriet Dyer of \u201cColin From Accounts\u201d), a driving examiner with few boundaries; Vic (Tony Cavalero), a former bouncer; Cici (Gigi Zumbado), an outspoken photographer; and Noa (Alex Tarrant), a handsome surfer whom Colette has her eye on. They\u2019re led by newly minted manager Barbara (\u201cSNL\u201d alum Molly Kearney, delightful to see onscreen again), who becomes dismayed when some consultants arrive \u2014 no matter where you work, that\u2019s never a good sign. Despite work and interpersonal turmoil, they make a fun and funny team that should be a welcome addition to CBS\u2019 fall lineup. \u2014 M.G.\n\u2018Mr. Scorsese\u2019\n(Apple TV+, Oct. 17)\nAmong the biggest challenges for documentary filmmakers of major figures is figuring out not only how to gain access but also the trust of your subject. The ability to get them to open up can turn an interesting documentary into a great one. And when the subject is Martin Scorsese, one of America\u2019s great auteurs, you want the full portrait of a director who helped shape cinema with iconic films like \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d \u201cGangs of New York\u201d and, most recently, \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon.\u201d Director Rebecca Miller (\u201cShe Came to Me,\u201d \u201cPersonal Velocity\u201d) seems up for the task, having created a five-part docuseries that\u2019s billed as the definitive portrait of 82-year-old Scorsese and will premiere at New York Film Festival this fall. \u2014 M.G.\n\u2018Nobody Wants This\u2019\nSeason 2 (Netflix, Oct. 23)\nThere will inevitably come a time when the drip-drop of wholesome, rom-com-level video content of Pamela Anderson and Liam Neeson on their \u201cNaked Gun\u201d promotional tour will loosen its grip on my social media algorithms, and I\u2019ll return to longing for a fictional romantic comedy to fill the void. That\u2019s where Adam Brody \u2014 who really propelled the art of the neck-hugging smooch combo \u2014 and Kristen Bell come in. The first season made millennial hearts squeal with its pairing of Brody and Bell \u2014 two decades after they rose to fame in the early aughts on teen dramas \u201cThe O.C.\u201d and \u201cVeronica Mars,\u201d respectively \u2014 in a delightful will they/won\u2019t they set in L.A. Bell is Joanne, a woman who often regales about her single life on the podcast she co-hosts with her sister Morgan (Justine Lupe), while Brody\u2019s Noah is a progressive rabbi who is newly single. But can their relationship make it past hurdles that include their careers, family and religion? The first season ended with a showstopping kiss that suggested they\u2019re willing to give it a try. The sophomore outing promises to unpack what that looks like. Let\u2019s just hope no one in this couple-with-obstacles is proposing a five-year waiting period to deal with personal matters before really giving it a go. (IYKYK.) Plus, \u201cGossip Girl\u201d alumnus Leighton Meester, Brody\u2019s wife IRL, joins the fun, playing Joanne\u2019s childhood nemesis. \u2014 Yvonne Villarreal\n\u2018Star Wars: Visions\u2019\nVol. 3 (Disney+, Oct. 29)\nDave Filoni\u2019s rise at Lucasfilm is proof enough that some of \u201cStar Wars\u2019\u201d best storytelling has happened in animation. My favorite has been \u201cStar Wars: Visions,\u201d an anthology series where international animation houses have been given the freedom to explore their ideas about the Force and the galaxy far, far away outside of the constraints of the franchise\u2019s existing canon. For the first season, Lucasfilm tapped Japanese anime studios for nine shorts, which featured a range of stories including those that centered an ex-Sith ronin, a Jedi Padawan turned lead singer of a rock band and even a Force-wielding droid. The series went even more global for its second season, with studios from Europe, Asia and South America being among those that were enlisted for their takes. The upcoming third season brings the focus back to Japanese anime, with sequels to three of the shorts from Season 1 \u2014 including my favorite, \u201cThe Village Bride\u201d \u2014 among the lineup. \u2014 T.B.\n\u2018Last Samurai Standing\u2019\n(Netflix, November)\nWhen I saw this series described as \u201c\u2018Sh\u014dgun\u2019 meets \u2018Squid Game,\u2019\u201d I had two competing reactions. There was the part of me that was slightly skeptical seeing a logline that leaned on two of the biggest Asian-led shows ever, but the part of me that grew up on a steady diet of chanbara is excited by the idea of a battle royale with samurai \u2014 and that part has completely won out. Based on the historical novel series \u201cIkusagami\u201d by Shogo Imamura, the Meiji-era set \u201cLast Samurai Standing\u201d will involve 292 warriors assembled at a temple in Kyoto for a deadly game with a massive cash prize. Considering the Meiji period was when the samurai became obsolete, the potential for social commentary mixed in with high-stakes combat seems pretty high. \u2014 T.B.\n\u2018Pluribus\u2019\n(Apple TV+, Nov. 7)\nIf you thought the grainy footage of Ariana Grande surreptitiously licking a doughnut inside an L.A. shop a decade ago sent shivers down your spine \u2014 health codes matter, people! \u2014 the first teaser for Vince Gilligan\u2019s new TV opus is just as chilling to behold. Ditching \u201cBetter Call Saul\u2019s\u201d signature cinnamon roll pastry for the hole-y American staple, the trailer for the new series takes place in the dead of night at an office building and settles on a woman, in a pink uniform, licking the tops of doughnuts one by one \u2014 ASMR at its eeriest \u2014 before placing them back in their box as a sign that reads \u201cHelp yourself!\u201d with a smiley face comes into focus. Uh, what? The series reunites Gilligan with \u201cBetter Call Saul\u2019s\u201d Rhea Seehorn, who was the show\u2019s beating heart with a ponytail as Kim Wexler, a skilled lawyer who gets caught up in the antics and schemes of Jimmy McGill/Saul Goodman. In this genre-bending sci-fi drama, she is the most miserable person on Earth who must save the world from happiness \u2014 it\u2019s the sort of TV premise that feels like it was tailor-made for my 2025 fatigue. In addition to Seehorn, the series stars Karolina Wydra (\u201cSneaky Pete\u201d) and Carlos-Manuel Vesga (\u201cThe Hijacking of Flight 601\u201d), and guest stars Miriam Shor (\u201cAmerican Fiction\u201d) and Samba Schutte (\u201cOur Flag Means Death\u201d). It\u2019s already been picked up for a second season so you can go in knowing there are no commitment issues. \u2014 Y.V.\n\u2018The American Revolution\u2019\n(PBS, Nov. 16)\nThe combination of PBS and Ken Burns (with co-directors Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt and writer Geoffrey C. Ward) returns again to improve your mind and remind you that history is not something that can be edited to suit the whims of a king or dictator, but also that it is made up of a variety of stories from a spectrum of participants. In these parlous times, when conspiracy theories are mistaken for truth and experts for enemies, those who might most profit from \u201cThe American Revolution\u201d are perhaps least likely to watch it, but in the course of this six-part, 12-hour foundational tale, anyone is bound to learn something. It will certainly have things to say about how Black and Indigenous people participated in this long moment. And if you have it, send money to your local public broadcaster, who needs it more than ever. \u2014 R.L."

His daughter Jessica Pinfield said in legal documents filed in January that her father\u2019s stroke left him \u201cincompetent\u201d to make decisions about his health and finances. The former music executive told the Hollywood Reporter in March that his daughter was \u201cthe one who saved my life\u201d and that he was unresponsive for two months.\nMatt Pinfield, a radio host and former MTV VJ, is unable to care for himself after recently suffering a \u2018massive stroke,\u2019 his daughter says in legal documents.\nPinfield shared more about his condition and expressed gratitude for his supporters in another, lengthier tweet on Monday.

      "text": "Longtime KROQ veteran Nicole Alvarez abruptly left the iconic Los Angeles radio station at the end of July, giving a brief goodbye during her final moments on air on July 30. It was a sudden change, and a notable shift after she\u2019d spent the past two decades as a steady presence at the station through successes and the more recent tumult of the past few years.\nNow Alvarez is breaking her silence, penning an emotional letter in The Holllywood Reporter about why she left, her hopes for the future of radio, and what\u2019s on the horizon.\nRelated Stories\nAudacy, which owns KROQ, declined to comment on Alvarez\u2019s letter.\nLike any great love story, this one is messy. It is not perfect, but it is real.\nI never knew how it would end. I just knew that when it did, I would have to be the one to write the final chapter.\nOn September 1, 2003, I walked into The World Famous KROQ for my first day. I remember every detail, the smell of the parking lot asphalt, the pulse in my chest, and Tim Armstrong of Rancid standing there in his \u201cSalvation\u201d jacket. That moment felt like the start of the dream. I had somehow landed a job at what was arguably the most iconic radio station of all time. This was the place that helped launch The Ramones, U2, Depeche Mode, The Cure, Nirvana, and impressive roster of others. The soundtrack of your life probably passed through these call letters.\nOn July 30, 2025, I said my final words on air in a moment that was emotional, frenzied, and irreversible. I did not walk in that morning expecting it to be the end, but I felt something. A shift. A knowing. After a heated exchange with my boss, one that crossed a line no one could come back from, the air cracked open. Time stopped. And I heard Iggy Pop\u2019s voice cut through the static like a liberation siren: \u201c\u2018Cause I\u2019m a punk rocker, yes I am.\u201d That was my cue. I did my final break, walked out, and didn\u2019t look back.\nI never got the chance to say a proper goodbye to the city and the listeners I will always love so much. That absence will weigh heavy on me forever.\nIt is worth saying that I love and respect my boss. He too is trying to navigate radio as it now exists under the corporate thumb and an ever-changing landscape. This is not about him. This is about something much larger. He who first hired me will always have a place in my heart.\nI was just shy of my 23-year anniversary at KROQ, and that alone is a badge of honor. I outlasted trends, format disorientation, bosses, budget cuts, and even my own rebellious nature. I did it always as myself. I never dumbed it down or dialed it in. I stood for the music, for the misfits, for Los Angeles, and for the station.\nLeaving KROQ is the hardest thing I have ever done. But staying would have been a slow death. After being disrespected by an executive known to do those types of things, I was done. So I lit my life on fire for something that matters more than anything, my integrity. This round, I was willing to bet on myself.\nI am never going to speak ill of KROQ. This isn\u2019t about a station betraying me. It\u2019s a story about what radio has become. About wanting more. About the way business is handled these days.\nThe truth is, I had already outgrown what radio was allowed to be. This was the station that launched iconic musicians and gave a voice to the outcasts and visionaries of Southern California and beyond. Once a tastemaker, a cultural detonator, a lighthouse for the weird and wild, it has now become a spreadsheet. A machine run by research, not instinct. By caretakers who cling to titles, not passion.\nThere is more I could say that I won\u2019t.\nI gave my whole heart to this brand. I turned down bigger offers to stay loyal. I defended the station through crises and controversies. When the pandemic hit and our legacy morning show was abruptly fired in a move that made us the most hated station in Los Angeles, I held the line. I gave the station my voice, my credibility, my name. I tried to glue it back together. It was hard to stand inside the house that raised you while it was burning to the ground. Still I stood. A lot of us did.\nThrough it all, what mattered to me, was giving the music life. Even the songs I didn\u2019t particularly love. Even the ones we played to death. I focused on giving them context, soul, and a reason for people to hear them again. I wanted to make people feel something. That is what radio is supposed to do. I wanted to be a friend, good company. I wanted everyone to remember why it is that we love music.\nI had the privilege of working with some of the most talented people in the world. I got to be part of legendary events. I talked Los Angeles through championships, earthquakes, wildfires and soul-shaking loss. I got to be part of what many still believe is the greatest radio station of all time.\nKROQ still has a chance to remember who it is, what made it \u201cworld famous.\u201d To take risks again. To matter. But it will require courage, not cowardice. Passion, not corporate approval.\nI leave knowing I gave everything to our listeners, our artists and our culture. I also leave knowing that none of it mattered to the executives in the big offices. But that is not my burden to carry. That is theirs. It mattered to me.\nI leave with KROQ in my heart. It was my honor to stand for it. Part of me always will.\nI started at KROQ under the greatest radio team that ever was. Kevin Weatherly, Lisa Worden and Gene Sandbloom. The holy trinity. I will always consider myself the luckiest girl in the world to have been there when it was untouchable.\nTo the artists, listeners, and colleagues I have crossed paths with, I hope I made you feel something. I hope I reminded you of your own talent. I hope I left a mark. I hope I helped you in some small way. Hell, I hope I even rattled you.\nRadio will always matter. In the right hands, it will always matter. To the executives suffocating it, it\u2019s never too late to introduce humanity into the corporate narrative. I challenge you to play the game without selling your souls. Radio is not dying. You\u2019re killing it. Just do better.\nAs for my legacy, I hope it has everything to do with music, a girl can dream. KROQ taught me that a long time ago. I hope it remembers.\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day"

  "argos_summary": "Nicole Alvarez, a 23\u2011year\u2011old veteran of Los\u202fAngeles\u2019 iconic KROQ, abruptly left the station after a heated clash with management, citing disrespect and a corporate shift that eroded the station\u2019s authentic spirit. In a heartfelt letter to the Hollywood Reporter, she praised KROQ\u2019s legacy of launching legendary artists and her personal commitment to music and integrity, while condemning the station\u2019s current corporate, spreadsheet\u2011driven culture. Alvarez emphasized that radio still matters when guided by passion, not profit, and urged executives to re\u2011embrace humanity in their programming. She will not speak ill of KROQ but will carry its memory in her heart, hoping her legacy remains tied to music and authenticity.",
