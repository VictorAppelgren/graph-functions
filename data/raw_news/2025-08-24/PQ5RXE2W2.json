  "title": "Out-of-balance bacteria is linked to multiple sclerosis \u2212 the ratio can predict severity of disease",
  "description": "Levels of 2 types of bacteria in your gut could help improve the diagnosis and treatment of multiple sclerosis.",
  "content": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease that results when the immune system mistakenly attacks the brain and spinal cord. It affects nearly one million people in the U.S. and over 2.8 million worldwide. While genetics play a role in the risk of developing multiple sclerosis, environmental factors such as diet, infectious disease and gut health are major contributors.\n\nThe environment plays a key role in determining who develops multiple sclerosis, and this is evident from twin studies. Among identical twins who share 100% of their genes, one twin has a roughly 25% chance of developing MS if the other twin has the disease. For fraternal twins who share 50% of their genes, this rate drops to around 2%.\n\nScientists have long suspected that gut bacteria may influence a person\u2019s risk of developing multiple sclerosis. But studies so far have had inconsistent findings.\n\nTo address these inconsistencies, my colleagues and I used what researchers call a bedside-to-bench-to-bedside approach: starting with samples from patients with multiple sclerosis, conducting lab experiments on these samples, then confirming our findings in patients.\n\nIn our 2025 research, we found that the ratio of two bacteria in the gut can predict multiple sclerosis severity in patients, highlighting the importance of the microbiome and gut health in this disease.\n\nFirst, we analyzed the chemical and bacterial gut composition of patients with multiple sclerosis, confirming that they had gut inflammation and different types of gut bacteria compared with people without multiple sclerosis.\n\nSpecifically, we showed that a group of bacteria called Blautia was more common in multiple sclerosis patients, while Prevotella, a bacterial species consistently linked to a healthy gut, was found in lower amounts.\n\nIn a separate experiment in mice, we observed that the balance between two gut bacteria, Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia, was critical in distinguishing mice with or without multiple sclerosis-like disease. Mice with multiple sclerosis-like symptoms had increased levels of Akkermansia and decreased levels of Bifidobacterium in their stool or gut lining.\n\nTo explore this further, we treated mice with antibiotics to remove all their gut bacteria. Then, we gave either Blautia, which was higher in multiple sclerosis patients; Prevotella, which was more common in healthy patients; or a control bacteria, Phocaeicola, which is found in patients with and without multiple sclerosis. We found that mice with Blautia developed more gut inflammation and worse multiple sclerosis-like symptoms.\n\nEven before symptoms appeared, these mice had low levels of Bifidobacterium and high levels of Akkermansia. This suggested that an imbalance between these two bacteria might not just be a sign of disease, but could actually predict how severe it will be.\n\nWe then examined whether this same imbalance appeared in people. We measured the ratio of Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Akkermansia muciniphila in samples from multiple sclerosis patients in Iowa and participants in a study spanning the U.S., Latin America and Europe.\n\nOur findings were consistent: Patients with multiple sclerosis had a lower ratio of Bifidobacterium to Akkermansia. This imbalance was not only linked to having multiple sclerosis but also with worse disability, making it a stronger predictor of disease severity than any single type of bacteria alone.\n\nHow \u2018good\u2019 bacteria can become harmful\n\nOne of the most interesting findings from our study was that normally beneficial bacteria can turn harmful in multiple sclerosis. Akkermansia is usually considered a helpful bacterium, but it became problematic in patients with multiple sclerosis.\n\nA previous study in mice showed a similar pattern: Mice with severe disease had a lower Bifidobacterium-to-Akkermansia ratio. In that study, mice fed a diet rich in phytoestrogens \u2013 chemicals structurally similar to human estrogen that need to be broken down by bacteria for beneficial health effects \u2013 developed milder disease than those on a diet without phytoestrogens. Previously we have shown that people with multiple sclerosis lack gut bacteria that can metabolize phytoestrogen.\n\nAlthough the precise mechanisms behind the link between the Bifidobacterium-to- Akkermansia ratio and multiple sclerosis is unknown, researchers have a theory. Both types of bacteria consume mucin, a substance that protects the gut lining. However, Bifidobacterium both eats and produces mucin, while Akkermansia only consumes it. When Bifidobacterium levels drop, such as during inflammation, Akkermansia overconsumes mucin and weakens the gut lining. This process can trigger more inflammation and potentially contribute to the progression of multiple sclerosis.\n\nOur finding that the Bifidobacterium-to-Akkermansia ratio may be a key marker for multiple sclerosis severity could help improve diagnosis and treatment. It also highlights how losing beneficial gut bacteria can allow other gut bacteria to become harmful, though it is unclear whether changing levels of certain microbes can affect multiple sclerosis.\n\nWhile more research can help clarify the link between the gut microbiome and multiple sclerosis, these findings offer a promising new direction for understanding and treating this disease.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

      "text": "In the last decades, researchers started to understand that the gut microbiota is a key player affecting human health, being an essential key in human health and disease(Reference Wang, Yao and Lv1). The focus shifted on understanding what constitutes a health- (eubiotic) or disease-promoting (dysbiotic) microbial community(Reference Wang, Yao and Lv1). Emerging evidence shows that alterations in the intestinal microbial balance could lead to dysbiosis and play a pathological role, contributing to the development of non-communicable diseases such as obesity, the metabolic syndrome (MetS), inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, colorectal cancer, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, allergies, autism and major depressive disorders(Reference Wang, Yao and Lv1\u2013Reference Hobbs, Williams and Hillerich6).\nThe human intestinal microbiota was shown to play a role as a vital regulator of basic human biological processes such as modulating the metabolic phenotype, extracting nutrients and energy from our diets, programming host immune system and regulating epithelial development(Reference Actis7). These core functions are linked to the production of essential and extremely diverse metabolites such as vitamins (vitamin B12, folic acid or vitamin K), bile acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine) and SCFA (acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid). These metabolites result from undigested fibre fermentation by the gut microbiota(Reference Fernandes, Su and Rahat-Rozenbloom8,Reference Ramakrishna9) .\nMore than 90 % of the entire population of the human gut microbiota are represented by two phyla, Firmicutes (which includes mainly Clostridium, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus and Faecalibacterium genera) and Bacteroidetes (which includes notably Bacteroides and Prevotella genera)(Reference Gomes, Bueno and de Souza5,Reference Senghor, Sokhna and Ruimy10) .\nPreliminary studies showed that some microbial species from the gut ecosystem had been linked to specific dietary habits. To illustrate, strong research efforts initiated by projects such as the European Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT) (http://www.metahit.eu) project, the American Human Microbiome Project (HMP) (http://hmpdacc.org) or the Asian Microbiome Project (http://www.asiangut.com/) had emphasised a higher diversity of the gut microbes of rural and preagricultural or isolated populations compared with westernised or industrialised populations.\nIn this regard, observational studies on these populations highlighted that these communities are characterised by an abundance of Prevotella species within the gut, whereas westernised populations harbour higher levels of Bacteroides than Prevotella (Reference Conlon and Bird11\u2013Reference De Filippo, Di Paola and Ramazzotti20).\nTo date, limited information is available linking microbiota or specific microbial species like the Prevotella genus to health markers; however, several studies have established a correlation between microbial taxa and disease(Reference Kobyliak, Virchenko and Falalyeyeva3,Reference Liu, Wu and Chen4,Reference Actis7) . Regarding Prevotella, studies focused on the associations between the diverse species, genome and habitats with dietary patterns, health and disease. Characterisation of the healthy human microbiota by using next-generation sequencing techniques has revealed a prevalence of Prevotella species at mucosal sites, within the respiratory system, oral and gut ecosystem. Evidence revealed beneficial effects of some Prevotella strains in the gut such as not only improving CVD risk factor profile and glucose metabolism(Reference Mancabelli, Milani and Lugli21,Reference Wang, Ames and Tun22) , but also pathobiontic properties of some strains which promoted diseases like the MetS, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease or other inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, bacterial vaginitis, HIV infection)(Reference Larsen23).\nThe necessity of larger cohort studies in order to establish a disease-triggering role of Prevotella species is highlighted, since inflammatory diseases are multifactorial and Prevotella is also considered beneficial due to its abundance in healthy gut microbiota and association with plant-rich diets(Reference Geva-Zatorsky, Sefik and Kua24\u2013Reference Zhu, Sunagawa and Mende26).\nTherefore, the selection of the Prevotella genus from the gut as the main subject for this systematic review lies in its significance as commensal of the human gut and its characteristic as dietary fibre fermenter. We decided to further examine eligible studies that focus on unravelling the association between dietary habits, food products and the presence of Prevotella species and their metabolite signature as well as the relevance of this bacterial genus in health status.\nExperimental methods\nLiterature search\nWe conducted our literature review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement(Reference Moher, Liberati and Tetzlaff27). The literature search was conducted independently by both authors, with disagreements resolved by consensus.\nWe searched the scientific electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection (WoS CC) and Google Scholar for potentially eligible articles. We developed a systematic search strategy, which included the following descriptors from PubMed: \u2018diet\u2019, \u2018gut microbiota\u2019, \u2018Prevotella\u2019 and \u2018health\u2019. In addition, we considered free-text terms like \u2018dietary pattern\u2019, \u2018eating behaviour\u2019, \u2018plant-based diet\u2019, \u2018dietary fibre\u2019, \u2018gastrointestinal microbiome\u2019, \u2018health status\u2019 and \u2018disease\u2019. The logical connectives \u2018and\u2019, \u2018or\u2019 and \u2018and not\u2019 were systematically used to combine descriptors and terms used to trace the publications. For the WoS CC database and Google Scholar, we adapted our final PubMed search strategy. In Table 1, we provide the exact search strategies of the literature databases. We also explored for additional articles by checking the references cited in the primary eligible studies included in this systematic review. The final search on 4 November 2018 resulted in 274 hits (Fig. 1) from the databases after excluding 9811 duplicates identified using Endnote (Thomson Reuters). An initial screening of the titles and abstracts of articles was then performed to exclude irrelevant studies. During the systematic evaluation, study data were reviewed, where possible, in relation to dietary patterns and levels of Prevotella, changes in the intestinal microbiota, the role of Prevotella in the gut system, the metabolite signature and any reported metabolic consequence of the Prevotella genus in rodents and human studies. Then, the full texts of potentially eligible studies were reviewed before definitive inclusion.\nStudy selection\nTable 2 provides an overview of the a priori defined inclusion and exclusion criteria that we applied to select eligible articles.\nWe (G. P. and D.-C. V.) independently screened all 274 abstracts. By applying inclusion/exclusion criteria to the information contained in the abstract, we reduced the pool of potentially eligible articles to 155 (Fig. 1). We evaluated the retrieved full-text articles applying the same inclusion and exclusion criteria that were used for the abstract selection. Any disagreements during the selection process were discussed among all the reviewers and unit consensus was reached. Finally, we included eighty-five full-text articles into our review, after we excluded seventy articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria.\nReview statistics\nA total of eighty-five studies extracted from 155 articles met the inclusion criteria and were analysed in the systematic review. The detailed steps of the systematic review article selection process are given as a flow chart in Fig. 1.\nRisk of bias within studies\nThe risk of bias was unclear in all trials. Lack of information precluded a proper evaluation of the risk of bias for all studies.\nResults\nWe identified sixty-eight articles and seventeen literature reviews published between 2008 and 2018 that have investigated the impact of different dietary habits on gut microbial communities, in particular on Prevotella levels or Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio. Moreover, the influence of urbanisation, industrialisation and geographical or ethnic factors on shaping the gut ecosystem as well as the role of gut microbiota in different diseases were evaluated (online Supplementary File S1)(Reference Fernandes, Su and Rahat-Rozenbloom8,Reference Mart\u00ednez, Stegen and Maldonado-G\u00f3mez12\u2013Reference Nakayama, Watanabe and Jiang16,Reference Gomez, Petrzelkova and Burns18,Reference De Filippo, Di Paola and Ramazzotti20,Reference Wang, Ames and Tun22,Reference Wu, Chen and Hoffmann29\u2013Reference Shankar, Gouda and Moncivaiz34,Reference Ferrocino, Di Cagno and De Angelis38,Reference Guti\u00e9rrez-D\u00edaz, Fern\u00e1ndez-Navarro and S\u00e1nchez43\u2013Reference Ruengsomwong, Korenori and Sakamoto45,Reference Matija\u0161i\u0107, Obermajer and Lipoglav\u0161ek47,Reference Chen, Long and Zhang55,Reference Hu, Park and Jang62,Reference Pedersen, Gudmundsdottir and Nielsen63,Reference Haro, Garcia-Carpintero and Alcala-Diaz66\u2013Reference Mej\u00eda-Le\u00f3n, Petrosino and Ajami68,Reference Hjorth, Roager and Larsen70\u2013Reference Kelly, Bazzano and Ajami74,Reference Prieto, Hidalgo and Segarra79,Reference Kang, Zhang and Zhu82\u2013Reference De Filippo, Cavalieri and Di Paola114) .\nThe studies described significant differences in the gut microbial ecosystem, influenced by dietary habits, lifestyle, geography and environmental factors, by using molecular techniques such as 16S rDNA pyrosequencing and shotgun metagenomic data(Reference Senghor, Sokhna and Ruimy10\u2013Reference Mart\u00ednez, Stegen and Maldonado-G\u00f3mez12). Most of the gut bacteria (approximately 60 %) cannot be cultured due to their particular requirements for anaerobiosis and nutritional needs. Therefore, the development of these techniques provided new knowledge on the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome as an ecosystem and its variation across the world(Reference Senghor, Sokhna and Ruimy10).\nDietary patterns shape the gut microbiota composition\nSpecifically, studies on the human microbiome have suggested that long-term dietary habits, geographical and ethnic factors could shape the gut microbiota into the so-called \u2018enterotypes\u2019 that were not specific to certain continents or nations(Reference Mart\u00ednez, Stegen and Maldonado-G\u00f3mez12,Reference Mancabelli, Milani and Lugli21) . The \u2018enterotypes\u2019 hypothesis was introduced in 2011 by Arumugam et al. as a useful method to stratify human gut microbiomes(Reference Arumugam, Raes and Pelletier28). Wu et al. used shotgun sequencing of the faecal samples from American individuals and used multiple clustering techniques, but found only two of the three original clusters: Bacteroides and Prevotella (Reference Wu, Chen and Hoffmann29). The third cluster was not distinct in their data, with Ruminococcus (Clostridiales order) equally abundant in both of the first two enterotypes. They compared their findings with a previously published study on Italian and rural African children, wherein Italian children had Bacteroides-dominated gut microbiomes and African children had Prevotella-dominated gut microbiomes(Reference Wu, Chen and Hoffmann29). Although consensus that these enterotypes are the result of long-term dietary behaviour is usually accepted, the concept itself has also been challenged, since other studies have proposed the existence of microbial community gradients rather than distinct enterotypes(Reference Costea, Hildebrand and Manimozhiyan30). Studies highlighted afterwards only two community types: one dominated by Prevotella and one dominated by Bacteroides or members of the Firmicutes Bifidobacterium (Reference Zhu, Sunagawa and Mende26).\nDe Filippo et al. (Reference De Filippo, Di Paola and Ramazzotti20) reported a considerable difference in gut microbiota at a phylum level, namely Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, between African children who followed a low-fat high-fibre diet and Italian children who consumed a high-fat and high-protein modern diet. The African children were living in a village of rural Burkina Faso, in an environment close to that of Neolithic subsistence farmers, while the Italian children were living in Florence, in an environment typical of industrialised Europe. The African children showed a significant enrichment in Bacteroidetes and depletion in Firmicutes (P < 0\u22c5001) with abundance of Prevotella and Xylanibacter bacteria and more SCFA (P < 0\u22c5001) compared with European children. The authors assumed that the polysaccharide-rich diets of African people shaped their gut microbiota in a way that helped to maximise energy intake from fibre while also protecting them from inflammation and non-infectious colonic diseases(Reference De Filippo, Di Paola and Ramazzotti20).\nSeveral other observational and cohort studies underlined the abundance of Prevotella species in Indian(Reference Dehingia, Talukdar and Talukdar31), Chinese, Kazaks(Reference Li, Fu and Yang32), Turks, Moroccans(Reference Deschasaux, Bouter and Prodan33), Indonesian, Thai(Reference Mart\u00ednez, Stegen and Maldonado-G\u00f3mez12), Filipinos(Reference Nakayama, Yamamoto and Palermo-Conde14), African (Malawian, Egyptian(Reference Shankar, Gouda and Moncivaiz34), Tanzanian and BaAka hunter\u2013gatherers(Reference Schnorr, Candela and Rampelli15,Reference Gomez, Petrzelkova and Burns18) ) and Venezuelan rural or isolated populations(Reference Yatsunenko, Rey and Manary35), whereas Bacteroides were abundant in populations from western countries in Europe and America(Reference Conlon and Bird11\u2013Reference Nakayama, Yamamoto and Palermo-Conde14,Reference Dubois, Girard and Lapointe19,Reference Wu, Chen and Hoffmann29,Reference Shankar, Gouda and Moncivaiz34) . The abundance of the Prevotella genus in these populations is determined by its capacity to digest complex carbohydrates and by the genetic and enzymatic potential to break down cellulose and xylan from foods(Reference Dubois, Girard and Lapointe19). A specific strain, Prevotella copri, has been shown to be an important biomarker for diet(Reference De Filippis, Pellegrini and Vannini13,Reference Gorvitovskaia, Holmes and Huse36) . Nakayama et al. have underlined in a study on Filipino children that the growth of P. copri and P. stercorea were stimulated by vitamin A and \u03b2-carotene from bananas and mangos(Reference Nakayama, Yamamoto and Palermo-Conde14). The authors also outlined that not only these two species of Prevotellaceae, but also species of Veillonellaceae (Dialister succinatiphilus) and Erysipelotrichaceae have a positive correlation with dietary carbohydrate. A high intake of fat positively correlated with Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Blautia, Dorea, Megamonas and negatively correlated with Prevotella (Reference Nakayama, Yamamoto and Palermo-Conde14,Reference Dehingia, Talukdar and Talukdar31) . Moreover, Li et al. showed in their study on healthy Chinese herdsmen that Prevotella gradually decreased with the degree of urbanisation, while Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Collinsella, Ruminococcus, Coprococcus and Dorea increased with the degree of urbanisation(Reference Li, Fu and Yang32). In addition, Mancabelli et al. highlighted in their meta-analysis of publicly available shotgun datasets of human faecal samples collected from urbanised and traditional preagricultural populations that industrialisation has shaped the gut microbiota through the acquisition and/or loss of specific gut microbes, thereby potentially impacting on the overall functionality of the gut microbiome(Reference Mancabelli, Milani and Lugli21). For example, Xylanibacter (Bacteroidetes) and Treponema (Spirochaetes) were only found in individuals from agricultural communities, which indicate that they could be symbionts lost in urban-industrialised societies(Reference Nakayama, Yamamoto and Palermo-Conde14,Reference Dubois, Girard and Lapointe19) . Enrichment in Succinivibrio and Treponema, which also possess a high-fibre degrading potential, is important for agrarian populations like the Africans, as the typical diet is high in fibre and complex carbohydrates(Reference Nakayama, Yamamoto and Palermo-Conde14).\nOverall, people living in African countries have higher gut microbiota diversity dominated by Actinobacteria (Bifidobacterium); Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides\u2013Prevotella); Firmicutes (C. histolyticum, Eubacterium, Oscillibacter, Butyricicoccus and Sporobacter); Proteobacteria (Succinivibrio, Shigella and Escherichia) and Spirochaetes (Treponema) and depleted in only Actinobacteria (Bifidobacterium catenulatum), Firmicutes (Clostridium difficile and Akkermansia muciniphila). Meanwhile, for people living in Western countries such as in Europe and America, gut microbiota is enriched in Firmicutes (Blautia, Dorea, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, Oscillospira, C. perfringens, C. difficile and S. aureus); Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides), Actinobacteria (B. adolescentis and B. catenulatum) and Verrucomicrobia (A. muciniphila)(Reference De Filippo, Di Paola and Ramazzotti20,Reference Mancabelli, Milani and Lugli21) .\nAssociation of dietary habits with microbial and metabolic profiles and the link with health or disease states\nThe distinct dietary habits of populations living in different geographical areas are reflected in their microbial diversity and metabolic profile. To exemplify, Western diet is characterised by high consumption of animal proteins and fat (meat, fish, dairy products), refined carbohydrates (processed foods, sweets) and low levels of fibre intake from plants(Reference Ramakrishna9,Reference Requena, Mart\u00ednez-Cuesta and Pel\u00e1ez37) . In contrast, Eastern diet consists of staple foods such as rice or noodles, soup and several dishes with a lot of vegetables. Populations living in isolated areas (like preagricultural populations) have a diet based on foods gathered and/or hunted from their proximate environment rich in carbohydrates and fibre(Reference Nakayama, Yamamoto and Palermo-Conde14,Reference De Filippo, Di Paola and Ramazzotti20) .\nEven though Prevotella has been linked with a vegetable-rich diet and Bacteroides with protein/fat rich diets, little is known about the composition of the gut microbiota in people with specific dietary patterns like vegetarian, vegan, Mediterranean or omnivorous(Reference De Filippis, Pellegrini and Vannini13).\nIn the last 10 years, few studies have reported the differences in faecal microbiota of individuals following a vegetarian, vegan or omnivorous diet, but studies on large cohorts are missing. Vegetarian, ovo-lacto vegetarian, lacto-vegetarian or vegan diets have increased in popularity lately, as studies reported beneficial effects on human health in terms of prevention of CVD, cancer and diabetes(Reference Ferrocino, Di Cagno and De Angelis38). The Mediterranean diet is characterised by a high intake of vegetables and fruits, legumes and whole grains combined with a moderately high consumption of fish, low intake of saturated fat, meat and dairy products and regular but moderate consumption of red wine and the use of olive oil as the principal source of dietary lipids(Reference Lopez-Legarrea, Fuller and Zulet39). This type of diet has also been linked to protective roles against several diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory diseases and CVD(Reference Lopez-Legarrea, Fuller and Zulet39\u2013Reference Santoro, Pini and Scurti41). On the contrary, the omnivore diet which is typical for Western diets from industrialised countries apparently led to a composition of the microbiota that is more associated with different types of diseases like obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and inflammatory disorders(Reference Albenberg and Wu42).\nMost studies reported that vegetarians harbour higher numbers of Prevotella species as well as a high Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio compared with non-vegetarians (omnivores)(Reference Ferrocino, Di Cagno and De Angelis38,Reference Guti\u00e9rrez-D\u00edaz, Fern\u00e1ndez-Navarro and S\u00e1nchez43) . However, one study by Wu et al. (Reference Wu, Compher and Chen44) reported that levels of Prevotella were not significantly different between omnivores and vegans from the USA, as the residence in a westernised culture might determine a more \u2018restrictive\u2019 microbiota structure. Ferrocino et al. showed in a cross-sectional study that vegans and vegetarians have an abundance of Prevotellaceae and ovo-lacto vegetarians were characterised by the presence of P. micans, B. vulgatus and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. P. copri was also found in a characteristic bacteria of the omnivore subjects, which is consistent with its presence in non-agrarian diets(Reference Ferrocino, Di Cagno and De Angelis38,Reference Ruengsomwong, Korenori and Sakamoto45) . B. vulgatus is associated with agrarian diets, being well known for its ability to encode the largest number of enzymes which target the degradation of pectin(Reference Hobbs, Williams and Hillerich6,Reference Egshatyan, Kashtanova and Popenko46) . F. prausnitzii was found to be a characteristic species in the faecal samples of the subjects who followed a vegetarian diet(Reference Matija\u0161i\u0107, Obermajer and Lipoglav\u0161ek47), and it has recently been shown that it has the probiotic ability to produce vitamin B12 and to hydrolyse lactulose and galacto-oligosaccharides(Reference Cecchini, Laville and Laguerre48). F. prausnitzii has also been recognised as being one of the most abundant butyrate producers in human faeces(Reference Cecchini, Laville and Laguerre48).\nMoreover, it has frequently been reported that SCFA (acetate, propionate and butyrate) are produced by intestinal microbiota during the fermentation of undigested polysaccharides. In contrast, non-digested proteins are broken down into smaller peptides or amino acids, in the end resulting in branched-chain fatty acids (valerate, caproate), phenolic compounds, amines and ammonia(Reference Portune, Beaumont and Davila49). It has been demonstrated that these microbial metabolites help controlling the colon pH, regulating energy control and prevent pathogen bacteria growth as well as modulating bacterial gene expression leading to the production of enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism(Reference Actis7,Reference Neis, Dejong and Rensen50) .\nEvidence shows that SCFA levels were higher in native Africans on agrarian diet compared with African Americans or European children (Italian)(Reference Nakayama, Yamamoto and Palermo-Conde14,Reference Dubois, Girard and Lapointe19) . Propionate was positively correlated with the presence of Prevotella in African children and negatively correlated with Bifidobacterium, Blautia and Lachnospiraceae(Reference Nakayama, Yamamoto and Palermo-Conde14). Specifically, propionate is formed mostly through the succinate pathway that is characteristic of Bacteroidetes(Reference Reichardt, Duncan and Young51) and has been shown to be metabolised in the liver. Its implications in reducing serum cholesterol and decreasing hepatic lipogenesis, thus preventing weight gain in overweight adult humans, was demonstrated(Reference Chambers, Viardot and Psichas52).\nButyrate was enriched in European children and positively correlated with Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Blautia, Dorea and Faecalibacterium (Reference De Filippis, Pellegrini and Vannini13). Butyrate is frequently produced via butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase with consumption of acetate and is mainly characteristic of the Firmicutes phylum. Butyrate promotes barrier function and reduces inflammation when present in sufficient quantity(Reference Den Besten, van Eunen and Groen53). It becomes the major fuel source for colonic epithelial cells, reducing the need for energy allocation to these cells from the host(Reference Den Besten, van Eunen and Groen53,Reference Tremaroli and Backhed54) . In addition, Chen et al. (Reference Chen, Long and Zhang55) analysed the fibre utilisation capacities of Prevotella or Bacteroides by testing fibres (arabinoxylans from sorghum bran, arabinoxylans from maize bran and fructo-oligosaccharides) in an in vitro fermentation system. The authors highlighted that through the fermentation of the mentioned substrates, Prevotella produced two to three times more propionate than the Bacteroides-dominated microbiota. Conversely, lower levels of butyrate were obtained(Reference Chen, Long and Zhang55). Acetate is a fermentation product for most gut anaerobes and consistently reaches the highest concentrations among the SCFA in the colon. Approximately, 70 % of the acetate is used as an energy source by the liver, but is also used as a substrate for the synthesis of cholesterol and long-chain fatty acids(Reference den Besten, van Eunen and Groen56). Moreover, it was revealed to act as an appetite regulator and thus aid in reducing obesity(Reference Frost, Sleeth and Sahuri-Arisoylu57).\nThus, the amount and relative abundance of SCFA may be considered as biomarkers of a healthy status(Reference Mart\u00ednez, Stegen and Maldonado-G\u00f3mez12).\nDe Filippis et al. showed that vegetarians and vegans had a high-level adherence to the Mediterranean diet, which positively associated to Prevotella and increased levels of SCFA (acetic, propanoic or butanoic acids) and negatively correlated to urinary trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels(Reference De Filippis, Pellegrini and Vannini13). In contrast, consumption of proteins and fat in omnivorous diets positively associated to higher levels of branched-chain fatty acids (valerate, caproate) and urinary TMAO(Reference De Filippis, Pellegrini and Vannini13). TMAO is a metabolite which has been recently shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular and atherosclerosis in both mice and humans independently of traditional cardiometabolic risk factors and through inhibiting hepatic bile acid synthesis(Reference Zhu, Gregory and Org58,Reference Schugar, Shih and Warrier59) . TMAO results from carnitine and choline found in animal products (eggs, beef, pork and fish), which are converted by the gut microbiota to trimethylamine, oxidised in the liver and released into circulation as TMAO(Reference Zhu, Gregory and Org58). In addition, the content of choline and l-carnitine in the traditional Mediterranean diet is more than 50 % lower than in a typical Western diet(Reference Mart\u00ednez, Stegen and Maldonado-G\u00f3mez12).\nInterestingly, Chen et al. showed in a study on mice that TMAO levels were decreased by resveratrol, a natural polyphenol found in grapes, berries and wine, which attenuated TMAO-induced atherosclerosis(Reference Chen, Yi and Zhang60). The authors further explained that resveratrol increased hepatic bile neosynthesis via gut microbiota remodelling (increased levels of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, but decreased levels of Prevotella)(Reference Chen, Yi and Zhang60).\nThus, while it is still unknown what constitutes a healthy gut microbiome, some studies have linked a microbial dysbiosis to some disease states. High levels of Prevotella were linked to obesity(Reference Moreno-Indias, S\u00e1nchez-Alcoholado and Garc\u00eda-Fuentes61) and significantly associated with BMI(Reference Hu, Park and Jang62), insulin resistance in non-diabetic people(Reference Moreno-Indias, S\u00e1nchez-Alcoholado and Garc\u00eda-Fuentes61,Reference Pedersen, Gudmundsdottir and Nielsen63) , hypertension(Reference Li, Zhao and Wang64) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)(Reference Michail, Lin and Frey65). Furthermore, Prevotella were also linked to high blood pressure and impaired glucose metabolism(Reference Egshatyan, Kashtanova and Popenko46). However, other studies did not find correlations between obesity(Reference De Filippis, Pellegrini and Vannini13,Reference Haro, Garcia-Carpintero and Alcala-Diaz66,Reference Borgo, Verduci and Riva67) , type 1 or type 2 diabetes(Reference Mej\u00eda-Le\u00f3n, Petrosino and Ajami68,Reference Forslund, Hildebrand and Nielsen69) and lower levels of Prevotella. In fact, Hjorth et al. reported that subjects with increased waist circumference and high Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio could easier lose body fat on diets high in fibre and whole grain than subjects with a low Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio(Reference Hjorth, Roager and Larsen70). In addition, Prevotella and Bacteroides levels were decreased at baseline in MetS subjects and increased after an intervention with Mediterranean diet and low-fat diet. In contrast, no significant microbiota changes after the dietary intervention were observed in the group of obese subjects without the MetS(Reference Haro, Garcia-Carpintero and Alcala-Diaz66). Furthermore, studies in mice indicate that Prevotella can determine features of the MetS. Colonisation of germ-free mice with a Prevotella-rich microbiota from patients with hypertension induced higher blood pressure compared with mice receiving microbiota from a normotensive donor(Reference Li, Zhao and Wang64).\nP. copri colonisation in mice on a high-fat diet promoted increased insulin resistance(Reference Pedersen, Gudmundsdottir and Nielsen63). Furthermore, Kovatcheva-Datchary et al. (Reference Kovatcheva-Datchary, Nilsson and Akrami71) showed that after a dietary intervention with barley, kernel-based bread (BKB), blood glucose and serum insulin responses improved compared with the group that received white wheat bread. Moreover, they compared the faecal microbiota of individuals who showed the least or no improvement in glucose or insulin responses (non-responders) to those who showed the most pronounced improvement (responders). They observed an abundance of Bacteroidetes (Prevotella) and high P/B ratio after BKB intervention in responders, but not in non-responders. Dorea and Roseburia initially increased at baseline but decreased in responders after BKB intervention. Regarding the SCFA profile, no significant differences were observed between the two groups. To investigate the effect of Bacteroides and Prevotella species on glucose metabolism, germ-free mice were colonised with human faeces-derived Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and P. copri for 14 d and fed a standard chow diet. The levels of Prevotella were higher in mice colonised with responder versus non-responder donor microbiota, which suggested that Prevotella may contribute to the BKB-induced improvement in glucose metabolism(Reference Kovatcheva-Datchary, Nilsson and Akrami71). Similarly, De Vadder et al. (Reference De Vadder, Kovatcheva-Datchary and Zitoun72) showed that mice colonised with the succinate producer P. copri exhibited metabolic benefits, which could be related to succinate-activated intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN). They concluded that the activation of IGN is positively correlated with Prevotella, which could in fact account for the beneficial metabolic effects such as improved glucose metabolism, by increased glucose tolerance(Reference De Vadder, Kovatcheva-Datchary and Zitoun72).\nLikewise, Vitaglione et al. showed that after an intervention with whole grain products, levels of Prevotella increased and a significant positive correlation was identified between SCFA and the abundance of Bacteroidetes in obese subjects(Reference Vitaglione, Mennella and Ferracane73).\nFurthermore, levels of Prevotella, Bacteroides and Dorea were favourably correlated with an improved CVD risk factor profile, such as BMI, waist circumference, triglyceride levels and blood pressure, in a randomised crossover study design with 3 g of high molecular weight \u03b2-glucan for 5 weeks(Reference Wang, Ames and Tun22). In contrast, Kelly et al. highlighted recently that some species of Prevotella (Alloprevotella, Paraprevotella, Prevotella 7) were associated with CVD risk(Reference Kelly, Bazzano and Ajami74).\nMoreover, Henao-Meija et al. elucidated the role of Prevotella in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is a hepatic manifestation of the MetS and has a leading role in triggering chronic liver disease in the Western world. They outlined that a Prevotella-rich dysbiosis was finally associated with pathology of the liver(Reference Henao-Mejia, Elinav and Jin75).\nDiscussion\nThe objective of this qualitative systematic review was to evaluate the available data revealing the modulation of the Prevotella genus from the gut ecosystem by different dietary habits as well as its implications as a potential biomarker for homeostasis or disease state through its metabolite signature. Moreover, the association with other bacterial species like Bacteroides and its role as a dietary fibre fermenter in the gut were also assessed.\nThe results of this review indicate that some Prevotella strains such as P. copri or P. stercorea were associated with plant-based diets, rich in polysaccharides and fibres, typical for rural communities, whereas the Bacteroides genus was correlated with a high-fat, high-protein modern diet, typical in Western countries. Moreover, P. copri was highlighted as an important biomarker for diet and lifestyle, due to its abundance in different populations across the world(Reference De Filippis, Pellegrini and Vannini13,Reference Gorvitovskaia, Holmes and Huse36) . The abundance of Prevotella species were shown in many populations with fibre-rich diets, due to its potential to digest and breakdown complex carbohydrates from foods(Reference Graf, Di Cagno and F\u00e5k76). Therefore, observational studies outlined high levels of Prevotella species in Indian(Reference Dehingia, Talukdar and Talukdar31), Chinese, Kazaks(Reference Li, Fu and Yang32), Turks, Moroccans(Reference Deschasaux, Bouter and Prodan33), Indonesian, Thai(Reference Mart\u00ednez, Stegen and Maldonado-G\u00f3mez12), Filipinos(Reference Nakayama, Yamamoto and Palermo-Conde14), African (Malawian, Egyptian(Reference Shankar, Gouda and Moncivaiz34), Tanzanian and BaAka hunter\u2013gatherers(Reference Schnorr, Candela and Rampelli15,Reference Gomez, Petrzelkova and Burns18) ) and Venezuelan rural or isolated populations(Reference Yatsunenko, Rey and Manary35), whereas Bacteroides were abundant in populations from Western countries in Europe and America(Reference Conlon and Bird11\u2013Reference Nakayama, Yamamoto and Palermo-Conde14,Reference Dubois, Girard and Lapointe19,Reference Wu, Chen and Hoffmann29,Reference Shankar, Gouda and Moncivaiz34) . In addition, vegetarian, vegan and Mediterranean diets were also linked with high levels of Prevotella and a high Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio(Reference Mart\u00ednez, Stegen and Maldonado-G\u00f3mez12).\nEvidence reported that these diets might have beneficial effects on human health, in terms of protecting against several diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory diseases and CVD(Reference Lopez-Legarrea, Fuller and Zulet39,Reference Santoro, Pini and Scurti41) . These diets were positively correlated with increased levels of SCFA, which are produced by the intestinal microbiota during fermentation of undigested polysaccharides and have well-documented beneficial roles(Reference Gargari, Taverniti and Balzaretti77,Reference Shortt, Hasselwander and Meynier78) . Prevotella species were shown to be positively associated with propionate production that has important roles in preventing weight gain by reducing serum cholesterol and decreasing hepatic lipogenesis(Reference Chambers, Viardot and Psichas52).\nPrevotella strains are classically considered commensal bacteria due to their extensive presence in the healthy human body and their rare involvement in infections. However, emerging studies have linked increased Prevotella abundance and specific strains to inflammatory disorders, suggesting that at least some strains exhibit pathobiontic properties(Reference Larsen23).\nSeveral limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of this study. First, assessing the way dietary habits or specific nutrients like dietary fibre impact the gut microbial composition could lead to different bias, as the bacterial communities have a great diversity and the interactions between specific nutrients and commensal bacteria from the gut are still not very well known. Moreover, the great inter-individual variability between different populations, the lack of in-depth metagenomic studies and small sample sizes for interventional studies could also increase the risk of bias.\nA review from 2017 underlined the interaction between P. copri and the immune system, revealing pathobiontic properties such as releasing inflammatory mediators from immune and stromal cells and promoting inflammatory diseases (periodontitis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, bacterial vaginosis, HIV infection, the MetS and inflammatory bowel disease)(Reference Larsen23). At the same time, inflammatory diseases are highly heterogeneous and the complex interactions between host genetic risk factors and environmental exposures are also important.\nSome studies positively correlated Prevotella levels with obesity, type 2 diabetes and NAFLD(Reference Michail, Lin and Frey65), while others did not find any correlations between these diseases and abundance of Prevotella (Reference Bibb\u00f2, Dore and Pes80,Reference Frost, Sleeth and Sahuri-Arisoylu81) . In addition, high levels of Prevotella were positively associated with glucose improvement in mice or improved CVD risk factor profile in humans(Reference De Filippis, Pellegrini and Vannini13,Reference Haro, Garcia-Carpintero and Alcala-Diaz66,Reference Borgo, Verduci and Riva67) .\nAnother recent review by Ley(Reference Ley25) analysed the possible beneficial and detrimental implications of Prevotella strains from the human gut on host health. It emphasises the importance of better understanding of Prevotella\u2019s wide genetic diversity, ecology and interaction with other commensal bacteria from the gut, in order to be able to modulate its levels(Reference Ley25).\nPrevotella may only play a part in certain disease endotypes, since they may exhibit different properties due to a high genetic diversity within and between species. These discrepancies in different studies may be due to the complex interrelatedness of the diseases, and additional investigations of immune mechanisms in metabolic disease are needed in humans. Thus, there is a need for more studies in humans to ascertain a causal and potential disease-triggering role for Prevotella (Reference Larsen23).\nConclusion\nAs Prevotella is a genus with high genetic diversity within and between species, they could explain its abundance in human healthy microbiota and only certain strains may exhibit pathobiontic properties. Nevertheless, there is a need for more studies in humans to ascertain a causal and potential disease-triggering role for Prevotella and more in-depth metagenomic studies are needed in order to reveal the health- or disease-modulating properties.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank Dr Vasile Coman for his constructive suggestions and linguistic review which contributed to the refinement of the manuscript.\nThis work was supported by a grant of Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS-UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P1-1.1-TE-2016-0661, within PNCDI III.\nG.

      "text": "Abstract\nMucin-degrading microbes are known to harbor glycosyl hydrolases (GHs) which cleave specific glycan linkages. Although several microbial species have been identified as mucin degraders, there are likely many other members of the healthy gut community with the capacity to degrade mucins. The aim of the present study was to systematically examine the CAZyme mucin-degrading profiles of the human gut microbiota. Within the Verrucomicrobia phylum, all Akkermansia glycaniphila and muciniphila genomes harbored multiple gene copies of mucin-degrading GHs. The only representative of the Lentisphaerae phylum, Victivallales, harbored a GH profile that closely mirrored Akkermansia. In the Actinobacteria phylum, we found several Actinomadura, Actinomyces, Bifidobacterium, Streptacidiphilus and Streptomyces species with mucin-degrading GHs. Within the Bacteroidetes phylum, Alistipes, Alloprevotella, Bacteroides, Fermenitomonas Parabacteroides, Prevotella and Phocaeicola species had mucin degrading GHs. Firmicutes contained Abiotrophia, Blautia, Enterococcus, Paenibacillus, Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, and Viridibacillus species with mucin-degrading GHs. Interestingly, far fewer mucin-degrading GHs were observed in the Proteobacteria phylum and were found in Klebsiella, Mixta, Serratia and Enterobacter species. We confirmed the mucin-degrading capability of 23 representative gut microbes using a chemically defined media lacking glucose supplemented with porcine intestinal mucus. These data greatly expand our knowledge of microbial-mediated mucin degradation within the human gut microbiota.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nThe intestinal mucus layer is a major component of the boundary region separating the luminal contents from the gut mucosa. Mucus functions as a barrier, a lubricant, an immune cell signal, a reservoir of signaling peptides, and a habitat for indigenous enteric bacteria1,2,3,4,5,6. The intestinal mucus layer is produced by specialized cells known as goblet cells. In the mammalian intestine, goblet cells synthesize and secrete the mucin protein MUC2. The MUC2 protein is decorated with O-glycans, which have core structures of \u03b1- and \u03b2-linked N-acetyl-glucosamine, N-acetyl-galactosamine, and galactose. These core structures are elongated and commonly modified by \u03b1-linked fucose and sialic acid residues3. These structurally complex mucin glycans make up approximately 80% of mucin mass. As glycoproteins, mucins can serve as a nutrient source for the resident gut microbes. Bacteria that harbor specific glycosyl hydrolases (GHs) are capable of enzymatically degrading mucin glycans. These released glycan oligosaccharides can then be used as a primary carbohydrate source for the mucus-associated microbiota, providing a sustainable and consistent nutrient supply2,7. It has been speculated that the ability to cleave and metabolize mucin O-linked glycans may be an important factor in determining which bacterial species colonize the outer mucus layer.\nThe degradation of mucin glycans requires the cooperative action of several glycsyl hydrolases encoded by the genomes of mucin-degrading bacteria2,3,8,9. To access mucin glycans, intestinal microbes must express the GH33 sialidases (also known as neuraminidases), which cleave terminal sialic acid residues. Microbes may also produce GH29 or GH95 to remove fucose residues. Following the removal of terminal sugars, bacteria can harbor N-acetyl-glucosaminidases (GH84, GH85, G89, GH20), N-acetyl-galactosaminidases (GH101, GH129), and galactosidases (GH2, GH35, GH42, GH98). There are also endo-acting O-glycanases (GH16) which can cleave large glycan structures. Known mucin-degrading bacterial strains include Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Ruminococcus spp., Clostridium spp., Paraclostridium spp. and Prevotella spp.3,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24. The best studied mucin degrading microbes are Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides spp. Akkermansia muciniphila is considered to be a mucin-specialist, as it can employ several enzyme combinations to hydrolyze up to 85% of mucin structures25. Bacteroides spp. are general glycan degraders and certain Bacteroides spp. are able to switch from dietary glycans to mucin glycans due to their extensive arrays of carbohydrate-active enzymes2. For example, B. thetaiotaomicron can extensively degrade mucin glycans and forage in the mucus layer when plant polysaccharides are absent from the diet11,26. Despite the growing number of bacterial genome sequences available, our knowledge of the mucin-degrading capacity of other microbes, particularly commensal human gut microbes, remains fragmented. The aim of the present study was to systematically examine the CAZyme mucin-degrading profiles of the human gut microbiota.\nMethods\nBacterial culturing\nThe following strains were grown anaerobically at 37 \u00b0C in brain-heart-infusion (BHI) supplemented with 2% yeast extract and 0.2% cysteine: Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC 8482, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ATCC 29148, Bacteroides fragilis MGH 10513, Blautia coccoides ATCC 29236, Blautia producta ATCC 27340D, Parabacteroides merdae MGH 10511, Clostridium butyricum CB, Clostridium symbiosum ATCC 14940, Clostridium inoculum ATCC 14501, Clostridium clostridiforme ATCC 25532, Clostridium sporogenes DSMZ 795, and Prevotella copri DSZM 18205. Akkermansia muciniphila ATCC BAA-835 was grown in BHI supplemented with 2% yeast extract, 0.2% cysteine, and 0.4% porcine gastric mucin (Sigma). The following strains were grown anaerobically at 37 \u00b0C in Man-DeRosa-Sharp (MRS): Lactobacillus gasseri ATCC 33323, Lactobacillus johnsonii ATCC 33200, Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 27305, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4796, Bifidobacterium dentium ATCC 27678, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697, Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521, Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 55813, and Bifidobacterium angulatum ATCC 27535. All cultures were grown in an Anaerobe Systems AS-150 anaerobic chamber supplied with a mixture of 10% CO2, 5% H2, and 85% N2. E. coli Nissle 1917 was grown aerobically at 37 \u00b0C in LB broth.\nTo assess mucin-degradation, overnight cultures were centrifuged at 6000\u00d7g for 5 min to pellet the bacteria and the bacterial pellet was washed 3\u00d7 to remove traces of the rich media. After the final wash, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of a chemically defined culture medium ZMB127 lacking glucose and sub-cultured to an optical density (OD600nm) of 0.1. The culture conditions included: (1) ZMB1 lacking glucose, (2) ZMB1 with 100 mM Glucose or (3) ZMB1 lacking glucose with 1 mg/mL pig intestinal mucin (MyBiosource cat# MBS2028824 > 90% purity, dialyzed in water with SnakeSkin\u2122 Dialysis Tubing, 10 K MWCO, FisherSci #P168100). All cultures were grown anaerobically at 37 \u00b0C and growth was monitored by measuring OD600nm after 20 hours of incubation.\nComputational analysis\nThe glycosyl hydrolase (GH) families involved in mucin degradation were downloaded from the Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) database (https://www.cazy.org) and examined as previously described28,29,30,31,32,33. Gene copy numbers were collected from all annotated genomes. The glycosyl hydrolases known to be involved in mucin degradation (GH33, 16, 29, 95, 20, 2, 35, 42, 98, 101, 129, 89, 85, and 84) were included for analysis. Of the 20,954 genomes available in the CAZy database, we identified 13,156 genomes harboring at least one gene copy of at least one GH family involved in mucin degradation. Microbes from healthy individuals were identified in the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) using the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) database (img.jgi.doe.gov) available through the Joint Genomes Institute (JGI) (Version 6.0)34. Removal of non-gut microbes and microbes not identified in healthy individuals resulted in 4385 genomes for downstream analysis. Any microbes in question were further examined by a literature search.\nStatistics\nGraphPad Prism (version 9) software (GraphPad Inc., La Jolla, CA) was used for all statistics. Growth was examined using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences between the groups were considered significant at P < 0.05 (*).\nResults\nWe identified 4385 human gut microbial genomes harboring at least one gene copy of a mucin-degrading GH family. We found one genus in the Verrucomicrobia and Lentisphaerae phyla, 12 different genera in the Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria phyla, 11 genera in Bacteroidetes, and 42 genera in the Firmicutes phylum (Fig. 1A). In the Verrucomicrobia phylum, Akkermansia was the sole genus (Fig. 1B). Likewise, within the Lentisphaerae phylum, Victavallales was the only genus (Fig. 1C). In the Actinobacteria phylum, Bifidobacterium had the highest representation, with 13 Bifidobacteria genera identified, followed closely by Actinomyces (11 genera), Microbacterium (4 genera), and Streptomyces (4 genera) (Fig. 1D). In the Bacteroidetes phylum, we observed high representation of Bacteroides (14 genera), Alistipes (7) and Prevotella (5) (Fig. 1E). Within Proteobacteria, we observed Serratia (5 genera), Raoultella (4), Mixta (4) and Enterobacter (4) at relatively similar levels (Fig. 1F). Multiple genera were identified in the Firmicutes phylum, with the most abundant microbes being Streptococcus (17 genera), Clostridium (10), Enterococcus (9), Lactobacillus (9), Bacillus (6), Paenibacillus (6), Staphylococcus (6), Blautia (5), Ruminococcus (5), among others (Fig. 1G).\nTo access mucin glycans, intestinal microbes must possess mucin-degrading glycosyl hydrolases (Fig. 2A)2. Released mucin glycan oligosaccharides can then be used to support the growth of bacteria. Given the prominence of Akkermansia as a mucin-degrading genus, we first analyzed the genomes of human gut microbes A. glycaniphila and A. muciniphila (Fig. 2B). The one available genome of A. glycaniphila contained a least one gene copy of GH33 (sialidase), GH16 (endo-acting O-glycanase), GH29 (fucosidase), GH95 (fucosidase), GH20 (galactosidase), GH2 (galactosidase), GH35 (galactosidase), and GH84 (N-acetyl-glucosaminidases). Similarly, all the A. muciniphila genomes contained a least one gene copy of GH33, GH16, GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH35 and GH84, as well as GH89, indicating that A. muciniphila can cleave sialic acid, fucose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine. Closer examination of the Akkermansia genomes revealed that the one genome of A. glycaniphila had six gene copes of GH33 and all 95 of the A. muciniphila genomes contained 2\u20134 genes copies of GH33 (Fig. 2C), indicating that Akkermansia spp. have the capacity to remove sialic acid and initiate mucin-degradation. The GHs with the largest gene copy range (6\u201313 gene copies) was GH20, a family containing \u03b2-N-acetyl-glucosaminidases (Table 1). No Akkermansia genomes contained GH42, 98, 101, 129 or 85, suggesting that Akkermansia is unable to degrade N-acetyl-galactosamine. To confirm the capacity of A. muciniphila to degrade intestinal mucus, we grew A. muciniphila ATCC BAA-835 is a chemically defined media ZMB1 lacking glucose, containing 100 mM glucose or containing 1 mg/mL porcine intestinal mucus (Fig. 2D). As expected, A. muciniphila had limited growth in ZMB1 with or without glucose but exhibited robust growth in media with porcine intestinal mucus. These findings complement our genome analysis of A. muciniphila ATCC BAA-835 (the BAA-835 genome analysis is found in the second column from the right in Fig. 2C). Additionally, various A. muciniphila strains were also examined to showcase the diversity of GH profiles across the genus, which supports the ability of this species to degrade mucins.\nNext, we examined Victavallales bacterium in the Lentisphaerae phylum (Fig. 2E). Genome analysis revealed a similar GH profile to Akkermansia, with genes for GH33, GH16, GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH35, and GH89, suggesting that Victavallales bacterium could enzymatically cleave sialic acid, fucose, galactose, and N-acetyl-glucosamine. Interestingly, Victavallales also harbored gene copies of GH42 and GH129, GHs not found in Akkermansia. The presence of GH129 indicates that Victavallales bacterium can release N-acetyl-galactosamine, a glycan which Akkermansia is not able to cleave. Victavallales bacterium possessed 4 genes copies of GH33 and 19 gene copies of GH2, which contains \u03b2-galactosidases. Although little information is available for Victavallales bacterium, the genome analysis reveals that Victavallales bacterium could degrade mucins.\nWithin the Actinobacterium phylum, we identified several genera harboring mucin-degrading GHs, including Actinomadura, Actinomyces, Bifidobacteria, Streptacidiphilus and Streptomyces species (Fig. 3A). We observed that 3 of the 4 Actinomadura spp. had 1 gene copy of GH33, as well as gene copies of GH16, GH20, GH2, GH35, GH84 and GH89, suggesting the ability of Actinomadura spp. to remove sialic acid, galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine (Fig. 3B). We found that all the genomes of Actinomyces israelii, A. naeslundii, A. viscosus and A. weissii, as well as 5 of the 7 genomes of undefined Actinomyces spp. contained 2\u20133 gene copies of GH33. Actinomyces members also contained gene copies for GH16, GH29, GH20, GH2, GH35, GH42, and GH101. This glycosyl hydrolase profile indicates the Actinomyces spp. can potentially cleave all mucin glycans.\nIn Bifidobacterium (Fig. 3C), we found that all 11 genomes of B. bifidum had 1\u20133 gene copies of GH33 and all genomes had GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH42, GH101, GH129, GH89 and GH84. Additionally, 8 of the 11 B. bifidum genomes had one gene copy of GH16. These GH profiles are consistent with previous studies which identify B. bifidum as a mucin degrading microbe since it can remove all mucin glycans20,22. Within the 44 B. breve genomes, we found that 41 genomes had one gene copy of GH33 and the majority of strains had GH95, GH20, GH2, GH42, and GH129, covering all mucin glycan structures (Fig. 3C). B. longum had much more variability in terms of mucin-degrading GHs (Fig. 3D). Only 11 of the 54 genomes contained GH33, the majority of which belonged to the B. longum subspecies infantis subgroup. Variable presence for GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH42, GH101, GH129 and GH85 was identified, with genomes harboring 0\u20135 gene copies. In contrast, B. angulatum only possessed 2 mucin-associated GHs: GH2 and GH42, suggesting that this species is likely unable to extensively degrade mucins. These data indicate that mucin degradation is species dependent in Bifidobacteria.\nWithin the two genomes of Streptacidiphilus spp. (Fig. 3E), we found that one of the two genomes had one gene copy of GH33 (sialidase), but both genomes had 10 gene copies of GH16 (endo-O-glycanase) as well as the genes for GH20, GH35, and GH42 (galactosidases). Commensal Streptomyces lavendulae, S. lividans, and S. pactum genomes contained GH33, GH16, GH95, GH2, GH35, GH42, and variable presence of GH101, 89 and 84. Among the 113 undefined Streptomyces spp. genomes (Fig. 3E,F), we found that 80 genomes had 1\u20135 gene copies of GH33, and the majority of strains had gene copies for GH16, GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH35, GH42 and GH84. Streptomyces spp. had several copies of GH2, with some strains possessing 10 gene copies. These data suggest that Streptomyces species are well adapted to remove sialic acid, fucose, galactose, and N-acetyl-glucosamine.\nTo confirm our genome findings, we also examined the growth of key Bifidobacteria in ZMB1 with or without glucose or intestinal mucus (Fig. 3G). Our genome analysis revealed that B. dentium ATCC 27678 and B. angulatum ATCC 27535 did not possess GH33 and had only 2\u20133 mucin-associated GHs, while B. longum and B. bifidum had several gene copies of GH33 and other mucin-degrading GHs. In our growth analysis, we did not detect growth above the ZMB1 media baseline when intestinal mucus was added, indicating that these species cannot degrade intestinal mucus to use as a carbon source. In contrast, B. longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697, B. longum ATCC 55813, and B. bifidum ATCC 29521 had enhanced growth when mucus was present, indicating that these strains can degrade mucins.\nAnalysis of genomes within the Bacteroidetes phylum revealed mucin degrading GHs in Alistipes, Alloprevotella, Bacteroides, Fermentimonas, Parabacteroides, Prevotella and Phocaeicola species (Fig. 4A). Only 2 of the 5 Alistipes spp. genomes had one gene copy of GH33, but all genomes had GH20 and GH2 (galactosidase) and most genomes had GH16 (endo-O-glycanase) and GH29 (fucosidase) (Fig. 4B). The one genome of Alloprevotella had GH33, GH16, GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH89, GH85 and GH84, one more GH family than Akkermansia, potentially indicating that this microbe could be a mucin-degrader. The one genome of Fermentimonas caenicola also had gene copies of GH33, GH16, GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, and GH42. Although there are few reports on this microbe, the GH profiles suggest that this Fermentimonas caenicola could also be a mucin degrader. Consistent with the literature, we found a large repertoire of GHs involved in mucin degradation in the Bacteroides spp. genomes (Fig. 4C). We found that 3 of the 4 B. caccae genomes had 2\u20133 gene copies of GH33 and all genomes had gene copies of GH16 (endo-O-glycanase), GH95 (fucosidase), GH2 (galactosidase), and 84 (N-acetyl-glucosaminidases). Additionally, 3 of the 4 genomes had gene copies for GH29, GH20, and GH35 families. All of the two B. cellulosilyticus genomes harbored GH33, GH16, GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH35, GH42 and GH89. Similar to B. cellulosilyticus, all six of the B. ovatus genomes, the one B. dorei and B. intestinalis genome and all 7 of the B. thetaiotaomicron genomes had GH33, GH16, GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH35, GH42, and GH89 gene copies. The B. thetaiotaomicron genomes also possessed GH84. B. fragilis had 16 of the 18 genomes with gene copies for GH33, but all B. fragilis genomes harbored GH16, GH29, GH20, GH2, GH35, GH89 and GH84. Additionally, 17 of 18 of the genomes also had GH95. We also examined 7 undefined Bacteroides spp., and found gene copies of GH33, GH16, GH29, GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, and GH84 (Fig. 4D). All B. uniformis members also had 1 gene copy of GH42 and B. vulgatus had 1 gene copy of GH42 and GH89. B. xylanisolvens genomes mirrored the other Bacteroides spp., with all 6 genomes harboring GH33, GH16, GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH45, GH42 and 5 of the 6 genomes containing GH89. These data support the notion that many Bacteroides members are mucin-degraders.\nWithin the 16 Prevotella genomes (Fig. 4E), we found that the one P. copri and three P. jejuni genomes all had genes copies for GH33, GH16, GH29, GH85, GH20, and GH2. P. jejuni also had 1\u20133 gene copies of GH85 and GH84. Furthermore, in the 12 P. melaninogenica genomes we found that 11 of the 12 had GH33 genes, while all the P. melaninogenica genomes had 1\u20134 gene copies of GH16, GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH85, and GH84. These data indicate that most P. melaninogenica are well adapted to cleave sialic acid, fucose, galactose, and N-acetyl-glucosamine. The Parabacteroides genomes mirrored the Prevotella spp. mucin-degrading GHs, with all genomes harboring GH33, GH16, GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH35 and GH84 (Fig. 4F). In addition, within Bacteroidetes we found that all the 16 Phocaeicola spp. genomes contained genes for GH33, GH16, GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH35, GH89 and GH84. We observed that 15 of the 16 Phocaeicola spp. genomes also had one gene copy of GH42 (Fig. 4G). We observed multiple gene copies of GH2 in Bacteroidetes. B. cellulosilyticus possessed the most GH2 gene copies, with 44 gene copies in total. To confirm the mucin-degrading capacity of B. vulgatus, B. fragilis, and B. thetaiotaomicron, we grew B. vulgatus ATCC 8482, B. fragilis MGH 10513 and B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC 29148 in ZMB1 with or without glucose or intestinal mucus (Fig. 4H). As expected, each of these microbes grew in ZMB1 lacking glucose supplemented with intestinal mucus, consistent with previous literature showing these microbes can degrade mucins13,14. We also grew Prevotella copri DSMZ 18205 and Parabacteroides merdae MGH 10511 to assess the ability of these Prevotella strains to grow in the presence of mucus. P. merdae did not grow in mucus, which was consistent with our analysis which showed no gene copies of GH33. Interestingly, although the one genome of P. copri in our analysis had GH33 expression and other mucin-degrading GHs, our P. copri DSMZ 18205 strain did not grow in ZMB1 lacking glucose with mucus, suggesting that growth might be strain specific.\nCompared to the mucin-degrading microbes identified in other phyla, we observed far fewer mucin-degrading GHs in the Proteobacteria phylum, with only 3\u20134 GHs families found in Klebsiella, Mixta and Enterobacter spp. (Fig. 5A). All 46 of the Klebsiella aerogenes genomes had one gene copy of GH33 (sialidase) and 1\u20132 gene copies of GH2 (galactosidase). Ten of the 46 K. aerogenes genomes also had expression of GH42 (galactosidase) and 41 of the genomes had 1\u20132 gene copies of GH20 (galactosidase), suggesting the ability of these strains to remove galactose residues (Fig. 5B). Similarly, all 23 undefined Klebsiella spp. genomes had 1\u20133 gene copies of GH2, but only 13 of the 23 genomes had GH33, 14 genomes had GH42 genes and 3 of the genomes had GH20 (Fig. 5C). No other mucin-degrading GHs genes were observed. Of the four Mixta spp., which includes M. calida and M. intestinalis, we found that all three genomes had 1\u20132 gene copies of GH33, GH20 and GH2, but no other mucin-related GHs were identified (Fig. 5D). We observed large variation in the 8 Serratia fonticola genomes. Only one of the genomes had GH33, 6 genomes had GH16, 7 genomes had GH20 and all 8 genomes had GH2 gene copies. In the Enterobacter genera, only 15 of the 73 E. cloacae genomes had one gene copy of GH33, although most of the strains had GH20 and GH2 gene copies (Fig. 5E). Similarly, only 5 of the 36 undefined Enterobacter spp. had GH33, while almost all the strains had GH20 and GH2 (Fig. 5F). Growth analysis of E. coli Nissle 1917 in ZMB1 with or without mucus, which was not one of the E. coli with GH33 expression in our genome analysis, confirmed the inability of this species to use mucus as the sole carbon source (Fig. 5G). These data suggest that commensal Proteobacteria are far less adept at degrading mucin than their gut microbiota counterparts.\nFinally, we examined the Firmicutes phylum and found that Abiotrophia, Blautia, Enterococcus, Paenibacillus, Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, and Viridibacillus species harbored several mucin-degrading GHs (Fig. 6A\u2013C). The one genome of Abiotrophia defectiva had one gene copy of GH33 and 1\u20132 gene copies of GH29, GH20, GH2, GH35, GH101, and GH85. Within Blautia, B. coccoides and B. hansenii had one gene copy of GH33 and genes for GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH101, GH85 and GH84 (Fig. 6D). In contrast, B. obeum, B. producta and undefined Blautia spp. had no gene copies of GH33, but did have variable gene copies (0\u201320) of GH16, GH29, GH20, GH2, GH35, and GH42, indicating the ability to remove fucose and galactose. Among the Enterococcus strains, only 1 of the 4 E. casseliflavus strains, 1 of the 4 E. durans strains, 2 of the 4 E. gallinarum, and 1 of the 4 undefined Enterococcus spp. possessed GH33. Variable numbers of gene copies were observed in GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH35, GH42 and GH85. In Paenibacillus (Fig. 6E), we observed that P. barcinonensis and P. lautus genomes had one gene copy of GH33 and both genomes harbored GH16, GH29, GH95, GH2, and GH35, while P. lautus also had gene copies for GH20 and GH85. Of the 29 genomes of undefined Paenibacillus spp., we found that only 4 strains had GH33, but the majority of strains had gene copies of GH16, GH29, GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH35 and GH42, suggesting that Paenibacillus spp. can remove fucose and galactose. We observed that all three Ruminococcus gnavus genomes had one gene copy of GH33, while undefined Ruminococcus spp. and R. torques did not harbor GH33 (Fig. 6F). Most Ruminococcus strains possessed GH29, GH85, GH2 and GH42. Among the streptococci, we found that all 8 S. intermedius genomes contained GH33, GH29, GH20, GH2, GH35, and GH85 (Fig. 6G). We also observed that 6 of the 9 S. mitis spp. had GH33 and most strains had gene copies of GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH35 and GH85. Only one genome was available for Viridibacillus spp. and this genome had GH33 and GH35.\nPathogenic Clostridium spp., such C. perfringens, have previously been shown to degrade mucins35, but little information exists on mucin degradation by commensal Clostridium spp. Of the 14 C. butryicum genomes, we found that only one of the genomes harbored GH33 and none of the C. sporogenes or undefined Clostridium spp. possessed GH33 (Fig. 6H). Compared to other species, commensal Clostridium spp. had only a few mucin-associated GHs, including GH16, GH95, and GH42. These profiles suggest that commensal Clostridium spp. are unlikely to be involved in substantial mucin degradation. Based on our genome analysis, we predicted that commensal Clostridium spp. could not degrade intact mucus and use mucus to enhance growth. To address this question, we examined the growth of several Clostridium spp., including C. butryicum CB, C. symbiosum ATCC 14940, C. inoculum ATCC 14501, C. clostridiforme ATCC 25532, and C. sporogenes DSMZ 795 in media with or without mucus (Fig. 6I). Consistent with our analysis, none of the Clostridium spp. had enhanced growth with mucus. Our genome analysis indicated that Blautia coccoides possessed multiple GHs involved in mucin degradation and we predicted that this strain would be capable of using mucin glycans as the sole carbon source. Similar to our GH profile, we found that B. coccoides had statistically significant growth with mucus compared to media without mucus. Finally, we examined Lactobacillus, which according to our genome analysis only have 1\u20134 mucin-associated GHs and do not harbor GH33. We grew Lactobacillus gasseri ATCC 33323, L. johnsonii ATCC 33200, L. brevis ATCC 27305, and L. acidophilus ATCC 4796 in media with and without mucus and found that mucus did not enhance the growth of many Lactobacillus spp. (Fig. 6J). These data provide a comprehensive analysis of mucin-associated GH profiles within commensal gut microbes and highlight that only specific gut strains have mucin-degrading capacity.\nDiscussion\nTo survive in the ever-changing environment of the gastrointestinal tract, gut microbes must be adept at foraging for nutrient sources. One way microbes deal with the varying availability of dietary carbohydrates is to forage glycans in the host mucus layer3. Mucin glycans are degraded by the sequential action of multiple mucin-associated GHs30. Sialic acid residues that terminate mucin glycans have been proposed to limit glycan degradation, thereby protecting the mucin glycan structure. Mucin glycans are also commonly terminated by fucose residues. As a result, mucin degrading microbes commonly encode sialidases and fucosidases to remove the terminal glycan structures, which then allow access to the extended core structures. Freed monosaccharides can then be used by the mucin-degrading bacteria themselves or scavenged by other bacteria2,7. Our comparative genomic approach has revealed that many gut microbes found in healthy individuals possess GH33 and other mucin-degrading GHs, indicating that these microbes have the capacity for extensive mucin degradation. Consistent with other findings, we found that Akkermansia harbored 9 different GH families and A. muciniphila ATCC BAA-835 was able to grow in a chemically defined medium with porcine intestinal mucus as the sole carbon source. We also identified several commensal bacteria with mucin-associated GH profiles and GHs numbers (\u2265 8 GH families) similar to Akkermansia, including Victavallales bacterium, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Streptomyces lividans, Blautia coccoides, B. hansenii, Bacteroides caccae, B. cellulosilyticus, B. dorei, B. fragilis, B. intestinalis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, B. vulgatus, B. xylanisolvens, Fermentimonas caenicola, Parabacteroides distasonis, Phocaeicola coprophilus, P. dorei, P. vulgatus, and Paenibacillus lautus. These genomic data suggest that several gut microbes may be able to completely degrade intestinal mucin glycans.\nTwo microbes we identified that appear to possess the ability for extensive mucin degradation are Victavallales bacterium and Fermentimonas caenicola. The family Victivallaceae has only two cultured representatives: Victivallis vadensis strain CelloT and the uncharacterized strain NML 08003536. These microbes are Gram-negative and anaerobic. There are also 16S rRNA gene sequences from uncultured Victivallaceae. Culturable V. vadensis can use galactose as a primary carbon source36. In our genome analysis, we found that Victivallales bacterium possessed GH33, GH16, GH29, GH95, GH20, GH2, GH35, GH42, GH89 and GH129. Several of these glycosyl hydrolases are galactosidases (GH2, GH20, GH35, and GH42). As a result, we predict that Victivallales bacterium may cleave mucin galactose residues to use as a carbon source. F. caenicola was isolated from the stool of a healthy Senegalese child as part of a study aiming at cultivating human gut microbes37. F. caenicola is Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacillus. Beye et al. found using an API 50 CH strip that F. caenicola also grows with galactose37. In our genome analysis, we found that F. caenicola harbors several galactosidases (GH2, GH20, and GH42), suggesting that removal of galactose from glycan core structures could promote F. caenicola growth. Our analysis also identified that the F. caenicola genome had gene copies of GH29, which contains a fucosidase. Interestingly, Beye et al. found that F. caenicola was unable to grow with d-fucose or l-fucose. Other microbes, like B. bifidum, have been shown to cleave fucose and cross-feed other bacteria, like Eubacterium hallii, which cannot degrade complex glycans38. It is possible that fucose release by F. caenicola may promote the growth of other microbes. Although there are no studies examining growth of Victavallales bacterium or F. caenicola with other mucin-related sugars or intact mucins, based on the GH profile, we predict that these microbes could use intact mucins and potentially use other mucin glycan sugars as carbon sources.\nAlthough we focused on microbes with GH profiles indicative of more complete mucin-degradation, it is well known that microbes can act in concert to break down glycan structures. In pioneering studies in the 1980s, Hoskins et al. examined fecal bacteria grown in mucin-based medium and found that 1% of the microbiota was able to use mucin as a carbon source, including the genera Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus39,40. Recent in silico analysis, which is not reliant on culturing techniques, has demonstrated that up to 86% of the human gut microbiota encode genes for cleavage of mucin glycans23. We also found that 62% of all microbes and 83% of human gut microbes in the CAZy database encode genes for mucin-degradation. These studies, as well as our own, have found that only specific bacterial species have a sufficient repertoire of enzymes to disassemble complex mucin glycans and that the complete degradation of mucin often requires the action of several bacteria. Our analysis reveals that many bacteria possess multiple gene copies of GHs targeting internal glycans. These findings suggest that mucolytic bacteria with GH33 may initiate glycan break-down and then the less-specialized bacteria with internal glycan GHs can participate in degradation.\nBased on our studies, we believe that the core GH-ome for mucin degradation includes GH33, 29, 95, and 20/35. More extensive degradation of internal glycans incorporates GH84/85/89 and 101. Our genome analysis suggests that mucin degrading microbes possess > 4 mucin-associated GHs. Additionally, microbes that extensively degrade mucin, like A. muciniphila, B. bifidum, and B. thetaiotaomicron, possess > 9 mucin-associated GHs. Despite the fact that many commensal microbes are not capable of extensive mucin degradation, the GH profile of bacteria such as Clostridium indicates that they could contribute to degradation when paired with another bacteria. For example, if A. muciniphila removes sialic acid, several Clostridium species could remove fucose with GH95. After A. muciniphila removes N-acetyl-glucosamine, almost all Clostridium could remove galactose with GH2 or GH42. These cross-feeding events likely occur in vivo and contribute to the health of the mucus layer. Future studies using mucus cross-feeding will likely shed light into the complex interplay because mucin-degrading microbes.\nSince mucin glycan degradation disrupts the first protection of the host mucus layer, host glycan foraging by mucolytic bacteria is commonly considered an initial stage in pathogenesis. While this notion likely only holds true for excessive mucin degradation, many consider mucin-glycan break-down to be a normal process and a key strategy for mucus-associated microbes. Given the continuous turnover of the epithelial cells and mucus in the human gastrointestinal tract, mucin degradation by commensal gut microbes is not likely to contribute to barrier dysfunction. Additionally, the capacity to degrade mucin is particularly important for early colonizers of the gut. Infants are commonly colonized with mucin degrading Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. longum subsp. infantis, and B. breve41,42,43,44. One study in Sweden identified the establishment of mucin-degrading bacteria during the first months of life44. We speculate that mucin glycan degradation gives colonizing microbes an advantage after the termination of breast milk and allows them to exert their beneficial influence on gut homeostasis.\nOne potential limitation of this work is that it is difficult to predict the exact specificity of a CAZyme based on family membership45. However, substrate categories can be broadly inferred within the CAZy families, even if the precise specificity of each protein in the family is challenging to predict3. An advantage of this type of genome analysis is that it does not require complex culturing, which can be challenging since many intestinal microbes are not able to grow in classical laboratory media. Genomic strategies have now been widely applied and are bringing new information about the diversity and function of human gut microbiota. Our genomic characterization has shed light on commensal gut species with mucin-degrading properties. We believe this work enhances the foundation for examining mucin-degradation within the human intestine.\nReferences\nCorfield, A. P., Wagner, S. A., Clamp, J. R., Kriaris, M. S. & Hoskins, L. C.

      "text": "Early screening for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism is important to ensure children have the support they need to gain the essential skills for daily life. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children be screened for developmental delays, with additional screening for those who are preterm or have a low birth weight.\nHowever, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has called for more research into the effectiveness of current autism screening practices. Primarily based on milestone checklists and symptoms, autism diagnoses also currently rely on observations of behavior that often manifests after crucial developmental stages have passed.\nResearchers and clinicians are working to develop simple, reliable tools that could identify early signs or risk factors of a condition before symptoms are obvious. While early screening can lead to the risk of overdiagnosis, understanding a child\u2019s developmental needs can help guide families toward resources that address those needs sooner.\nWe are researchers who study the role the microbiome plays in a variety of conditions, such as mental illness, autoimmunity, obesity, preterm birth and others. In our recently published research on Swedish children, we found that microbes and the metabolites they produce in the guts of infants \u2013 both found in poop and cord blood \u2013 could help screen for a child\u2019s risk of neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism. And these differences can be detected as early as birth or within the first year of life. These markers were evident, on average, over a decade before the children were diagnosed.\nMicrobes as biomarkers\nBiomarkers are biological indicators \u2013 such as genes, proteins or metabolites in blood, stool or other types of samples \u2013 that signal the presence of a condition at a certain point in time. There are no known biomarkers for autism. Efforts to find biomarkers have been largely hindered by the fact that autism has many potential pathways that lead to it, and researchers tend to ignore how these causes may work together as a whole.\nOne potential biomarker for neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism are gut microbes. The connection between the gut and brain, or the gut-brain axis, is an area of considerable interest among scientists. Gut microbes play significant roles in health, including in immunity, neurotransmitter balance, digestive health and much more.\nA lot of work has been done around mapping what a \u201ctypical\u201d microbiome looks like based on age and organ system. Researchers have shown that the microbiome is personalized enough that it can distinguish two people or two households even better than genetics, with differences in colonization starting very early in life.\nThe microbiome undergoes immense changes during childhood. It shapes and is shaped by the immune system and influenced by life changes and events. It is also influenced by factors like genetics, environment, lifestyle, infection and medications.\nGastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, pain and constipation are common in children with autism and ADHD, with as many as 30% to 70% of autism patients also diagnosed with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Untreated GI issues can also lead to additional sleep and behavioral disorders among these children. A small pilot study found that children with autism showed improvements in gastrointestinal and autism-related symptoms after having healthy microbes transferred into their guts, with some benefits lasting up to two years.\nMost studies on the microbiome and neurodevelopmental conditions, however, are restricted to people who are already diagnosed with ADHD, autism or other conditions, and these studies often show mixed results. These limitations raise an important question: Does the microbiome play a direct role in the development of autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions, or are changes in microbiome composition a consequence of the conditions themselves?\nSome investigations have proposed that the microbiome has little or no association with future autism. However, these studies have a notable limitation: They don\u2019t examine microbial imbalances prior to diagnosis or symptom onset. Instead, these studies focus on children already diagnosed with autism, comparing them to their siblings and unrelated neurotypical children. In most cases, dietary data and samples are collected several years after diagnosis, meaning the study cannot test for whether microbial imbalances cause autism.\nMicrobes matter\nWe wondered whether studying the bacteria residing in small children before they are diagnosed or show symptoms of autism or other conditions could give us a clue into their neurodevelopment. So, we examined the cord blood and stool collected at approximately 1 year of age from participants of an ongoing study called All Babies in Southeast Sweden, which follows the health of approximately 17,000 children born between 1997 and 1999 and their parents. We have followed these children since birth, nearly 1,200 of whom were later diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder by age 23.\nWe found significant differences in bacterial composition and metabolite levels that developed before symptoms of neurodevelopmental conditions \u2013 such as gastrointestinal upset, crankiness and sleep problems \u2013 as well as formal medical diagnoses. These differences spanned many conditions, including autism, ADHD and speech disorders.\nNext, we linked bacteria to neurotransmitters \u2013 chemical signals that help brain cells communicate \u2013 and vitamins such as riboflavin and vitamin B in the child\u2019s stool. Given previous research on children and adults already diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder, we expected to find differences in the microbiome composition and health between those with and without neurodevelopmental conditions.\nBut we were surprised to discover just how early these differences emerge. We saw variability in the microbes and metabolites that affect immune and brain health, among others, in the stool collected from the diapers of children around 1 year of age and in umbilical cord blood collected at birth.\nThe imbalance in microbial composition \u2013 what microbiologists call dysbiosis \u2013 we observed suggests that incomplete recovery from repeated antibiotic use may greatly affect children during this vulnerable period. Similarly, we saw that repeated ear infections were linked to a twofold increased likelihood of developing autism.\nChildren who both repeatedly used antibiotics and had microbial imbalances were significantly more likely to develop autism. More specifically, children with an absence of Coprococcus comes, a bacterium linked to mental health and quality of life, and increased prevalence of Citrobacter, a bacterium known for antimicrobial resistance, along with repeated antibiotic use were two to four times more likely to develop a neurodevelopmental disorder.\nAntibiotics are necessary for treating certain bacterial infections in children, and we emphasize that our findings do not suggest avoiding their use altogether. Parents should use antibiotics if they are prescribed and deemed necessary by their pediatrician. Rather, our study suggests that repeated antibiotic use during early childhood may signal underlying immune dysfunction or disrupted brain development, which can be influenced by the gut microbiome. In any case, it is important to consider whether children could benefit from treatments to restore their gut microbes after taking antibiotics, an area we are actively studying.\nAnother microbial imbalance in children who later were diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders was a decrease in Akkermansia muciniphila, a bacterium that reinforces the lining of the gut and is linked to neurotransmitters important to neurological health.\nEven after we accounted for factors that could influence gut microbe composition, such as how the baby was delivered and breastfeeding, the relationship between imbalanced bacteria and future diagnosis persisted. And these imbalances preceded diagnosis of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability by 13 to 14 years on average, refuting the assumption that gut microbe imbalances arise from diet.\nWe found that lipids and bile acids were depleted in the cord blood of newborns with future autism. These compounds provide nutrients for beneficial bacteria, help maintain immune balance and influence neurotransmitter systems and signaling pathways in the brain.\nMicrobiome screening at well-child visits\nMicrobiome screening is not a common practice in well-child visits. But our findings suggest that detecting imbalances in beneficial and harmful bacteria, especially during critical periods of early childhood development, can provide essential insights for clinicians and families.\nThere is a long way to go before such screening becomes a standard part of pediatric care. Researchers still need validated methods to analyze and interpret microbiome data in the clinic. It\u2019s also unclear how bacterial differences change across time in children around the world \u2013 not just which bacteria are present or absent, but also how they may be shaping immune responses and metabolism. But our findings reaffirm the growing body of evidence that the early gut microbiome plays a key role in shaping neurodevelopment."

Project 2025 \u2013 assembled by Trump allies \u2013 is part of a lineage of conservative reactions to liberal presidents\u2019 plans.\nWhile scientists still aren\u2019t sure how phosphine wreaks so much havoc on the body, some are developing medications that can help mitigate the harm it causes.\nDonald Trump has history on his side when he muses about the US acquiring Greenland. That idea was proposed by military brass in a memorandum almost 70 years ago."

      "text": "Slime is everywhere. It shapes the consistency of your bodily fluids, from the saliva in your mouth to the goo that covers your organs. It protects you against pathogens, including coronavirus, while creating a home in your mouth for billions of friendly bacteria. It helps slugs have Spiderman sex hanging from walls, hagfish turn water into rapidly expanding goo, lampreys filter their food and swiftlets build nests.\nBut while slime is essential for all forms of complex life, its evolutionary origins have remained murky.\nI am an evolutionary geneticist who studies how humans and their genomes evolve. Along with my colleagues, including my long-time collaborator Stefan Ruhl and my student Petar Pajic, we tackled this evolutionary puzzle in our recently published paper. We began by looking into how salivary slime is made in different species. What we found was that slime opens a window into the role that repetitive DNA plays in the mysteries of evolution.\nWhat are mucins?\nSlime is made up of proteins called mucins, which are vessels for sugar molecules. These sugars are the key taskmasters in making things slimy.\nUnlike other proteins, which typically have intricate 3D shapes, mucins often take the shape of long, rigid rods. Sugar molecules are attached along the length of the rods, creating complex, brush-like structures.\nThis partnership between protein building blocks and the sugars bound to them, repeated over and over again, is essential to the properties of mucins. These structures can stick to other mucins and microbes, changing the physical properties of the fluids surrounding them into a sticky and slimy substance.\nThe evolution of slime\nDespite the remarkable properties mucins have and their essential role in biology, how they evolved has eluded scientists.\nTo begin to figure out the evolutionary origins of mucins, my colleagues and I began by looking for common genetic ancestors for mucins across 49 mammal species. After all, evolution often tinkers but rarely invents. The easiest way for a new gene to evolve is by copying and pasting an existing one and making small changes to the new copy to fit the environmental circumstances. The chances of one species independently inventing a complex mucin from scratch are astronomically small. Our research team was sure that copying and pasting existing mucin genes that then adapt to a particular species\u2019 needs was the main driver of mucin evolution.\nBut our initial assumptions proved incomplete. Copying and pasting mucin genes in a genome should lead to daughter genes that have similarities to each other. Even though some mucins did fit our criteria, a previous study reviewed all known genes coding for mucins in people and found a number of \u201corphan\u201d mucins that do not belong to any gene family. They exist alone in the vast landscape of the human genome.\nWe then focused on searching for such orphan genes in the genomes of dozens of species in genetic databases. We found 15 instances of new mucin genes that evolved in different mammals, lacking any connection to known mucin genes.\nFurther investigation, however, revealed that these mucin genes do have relatives after all. They share ancestry with other rod-like proteins rich in the amino acid proline, which are commonly found in saliva. These proteins rich in proline, however, do not have the key repetitive protein structures that help mucins bind to sugar molecules.\nWe hypothesized that these proteins rich in proline could undergo \u201cmucinization\u201d by repeatedly adding proteins that bind to sugar molecules, called glycoproteins. To test this, we compared the sequences of genes coding for mucins and genes coding for proteins rich in proline in different mammals, including people. We found that the sequences were highly similar. The only difference was the presence of repeated segments of glycoproteins in mucins. What this meant is that certain proteins could be transformed into mucins just by adding on copies of these repeated segments.\nRepetitive DNA and evolution\nOur findings reveal the diversity of mucins in a whole manner of creatures, opening a view into evolution\u2019s slimy playground of adaptation.\nResearchers often ignore repetitive genetic sequences because they rarely occur within genes that code for the proteins that perform many biological functions in cells. But in the case of mucins, creating repeat sequences from scratch turns out to be a major engine for their evolution. Our earlier work in primates suggests that the number of repeated sugar-binding segments there are in a given mucin may be the factor that determines its differences from others.\nIt\u2019s possible that the addition of repetitive genetic sequences may also discreetly shape other functions across the genome as well. Indeed, such tandem repeats are a common type of mutation in the human genome, and recent studies hint to their undiscovered role in biological variation between people.\nMucins and human health\nUnderstanding how mucins work will also help researchers better understand a number of diseases.\nWhen mucins do not work properly, it can lead to illness. People with a malfunctioning CFTR gene develop cystic fibrosis, where their bodies are unable to clear mucus from their lungs and make it difficult to breathe. Malfunctioning mucin regulation is also linked to cancer development.\nThough it may not be obvious, you likely have a personal connection to mucins. Two years ago, I visited my mother after her cancer diagnosis. The rain had just ended, and the streets of Istanbul become a bustling village of unnervingly large snails. During a short walk with my mother, I picked up one of those snails with fascination, much to her horror.\nI did not have the heart to tell her that the biological mechanism that allows these awesome creatures to move was the same one helping the tumor in her lungs grow. It reminded me of the scientist Michael Faraday\u2019s words: \u201cNo matter what you look at, if you look at it closely enough, you are involved in the entire universe.\u201d"

      "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis affects 1 in 100 people worldwide. It causes inflamed, painful and swollen joints, often in the hands and wrists, and can lead to loss of joint function as well as chronic pain and joint deformities and damage. What causes this condition has been unknown.\nIn our October 2022 study, my colleagues and I found an important clue to a potential culprit behind this disease: the bacteria in your gut.\nWhat causes rheumatoid arthritis?\nRheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition, meaning it develops when the body\u2019s immune system starts to attack itself. Proteins called antibodies, which usually help fight off viruses and bacteria, begin to attack the joints instead.\nThe origins of the antibodies that cause rheumatoid arthritis have been an area of study for many years. Some research has shown that these antibodies can start forming at sites like the mouth, lung and intestines over 10 years before symptoms arise. But until now, it was unclear why researchers were finding these antibodies in these particular areas.\nWe wanted to investigate what could trigger the formation of these antibodies. Specifically, we wondered if bacteria in the microbiome, a community of microorganisms that live in the intestines, might be the ones activating the immune response that leads to rheumatoid arthritis. Since microbes commonly live at the same sites as the antibodies driving rheumatoid arthritis, we hypothesized that these bacteria could be triggering the production of these antibodies. We reasoned that though these antibodies were meant to attack the bacteria, rheumatoid arthritis develops when they spread beyond the intestines to attack the joints.\nFirst, we sought to identify the intestinal bacteria targeted by these antibodies. To do this, we exposed the bacteria in the feces of a subset of people at risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis to these antibodies, allowing us to isolate just the bacterial species that reacted and bound to the antibodies.\nWe found that one previously unknown species of bacteria was present in the intestines of around 20% of people who were either diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis or produce the antibodies that cause the disease. As a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, I suggested we name this species Subdoligranulum didolesgii (\u201cdidolesgii\u201d means arthritis or rheumatism in Cherokee) as a nod to the contributions that other Indigenous scholars have made to science as well as the fact that rheumatoid arthritis affects Indigenous people at a higher rate than other populations.\nSubdoligranulum didolesgii has not been detected in the feces of healthy people before, and it is currently unknown how prevalent this bacteria is in the general population.\nWe also found that these bacteria can activate specialized immune cells called T cells in people with rheumatoid arthritis. T cells drive inflammatory responses in the body, and have been linked to the development of different autoimmune diseases.\nThese findings suggest that these gut bacteria may be activating the immune systems of people with rheumatoid arthritis. But instead of attacking the bacteria, their immune system attacks the joints.\nWhy this bacteria?\nIt is still unknown why people with rheumatoid arthritis develop an immune response to Subdoligranulum didolesgii. But we think it may be the culprit when it comes to rheumatoid arthritis because this bacteria is found only in the intestines of people with rheumatoid arthritis, and not in the intestines of healthy people.\nWhile many immune responses happen in the intestines, they are usually self-contained and do not spread to other areas of the body. However, we believe that a particularly strong intestinal immune response against Subdoligranulum didolesgii could allow antibodies to bypass the intestinal \u201cfirewall\u201d and spread to the joints.\nTo confirm our hypothesis, we gave mice an oral dose of Subdoligranulum didolesgii and monitored their reaction. Within 14 days, the mice began to develop joint swelling and antibodies that attacked their joints.\nThe future of rheumatoid arthritis treatment\nMy colleagues and I hope this research can shed light on the origins of rheumatoid arthritis. Our next goal is to discover how common these bacteria are in the general population and test whether the presence of these bacteria in the gut may lead to the development of rheumatoid arthritis in people.\nIt\u2019s important to note that antibiotics are unlikely to be helpful treatment for the microbiomes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Although Subdoligranulum didolesgii may be triggering an autoimmune response for some people with rheumatoid arthritis, antibiotics eliminate both helpful and harmful bacteria in the gut. Additionally, removing the bacteria won\u2019t necessarily stop the immune system from attacking the joints once it has started.\nNevertheless, we believe that these bacteria can be used as tools to develop treatments for rheumatoid arthritis and hopefully ways to prevent disease from happening in the first place."

      "text": "Students at elite universities tend to talk a good game when it comes to religious pluralism. Many of them show up on day one already saying all the right things about respecting different faiths.\nBut here\u2019s the paradox: They don\u2019t grow from there, according to our research published in The Journal of Higher Education. Students at less selective colleges, meanwhile, do develop more pluralistic attitudes. And by their fourth year, they participate in interfaith activities, such as taking courses about different religions or joining in interfaith dialogues, just as much as anyone else.\nReligious pluralism goes beyond tolerance or diversity, which are simply coexisting with people of different faiths. Pluralism involves actively seeking to understand other traditions, talking with people from other backgrounds and working with them toward common goals.\nAs scholars of religion and education, we worked with sociologist of education David Shuang Song to study how students\u2019 attitudes and actions change over time. We examined data from more than 3,100 students at 112 colleges, using the Interfaith Diversity Experiences and Attitudes Longitudinal Survey. Our study tracked students for four years, measuring two things: their attitudes about appreciating different faiths, and their actual participation in interfaith activities.\nOur study revealed three findings.\nFirst, freshmen at highly selective schools \u2013 institutions that typically admit fewer than 1 in 5 applicants \u2013 often start with stronger support for religious pluralism. Compared with freshmen at less selective schools, they are more likely to agree with questions like \u201cI respect people who have religious or nonreligious perspectives that differ from my own,\u201d though the difference was modest.\nSecond, fourth-year students at less selective schools showed more pluralistic attitudes than at the start of college. In contrast, students at elite institutions maintained their high initial attitudes without any measurable change.\nThird, students at all types of institutions participated in more interfaith activities by the end of college, on average, with less selective schools showing slightly larger gains. That might mean attending services of different faiths, taking courses about other religions or joining dialogue groups.\nThe bottom line: At less selective colleges, students tended to develop stronger attitudes about religious pluralism, and they also increased their interfaith activities. At elite colleges, students increased their activities, but their attitudes more often remained flat.\nWhy it matters\nThe United States is growing more religiously diverse \u2013 with growing numbers of non-Christian and nonreligious adults \u2013 and more divided across religious lines. Antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents have surged over the past few years, including on college campuses. All of this makes it especially urgent that colleges prepare students to bridge divides.\nOur findings reveal an interesting paradox: Elite institutions admit students who already express strong support for religious pluralism on surveys. On average, however, students\u2019 attitudes don\u2019t deepen during college, although their interfaith activities do increase somewhat.\nAnd students\u2019 answers to questions about pluralism don\u2019t necessarily demonstrate genuine commitment. For example, these attitudes may be part of how some elite students learn to seem culturally sophisticated \u2013 voicing ideals they associate with being open-minded, cosmopolitan and educated.\nThe findings may challenge assumptions about where meaningful education about diversity occurs. On average, less selective institutions, which educate most college students, begin with students less inclined toward pluralism. Yet in general, we found that these schools successfully foster growth in both attitudes and behavior \u2013 particularly when interfaith programs are integrated into everyday campus life and curriculum. All colleges can challenge students through experiences like interfaith events, research projects or internships.\nWhat\u2019s next\nToday\u2019s college students are tomorrow\u2019s civic leaders, educators, policymakers and professionals. If institutions are struggling to cultivate the skills students need to have conversations and collaborate with people from diverse religious backgrounds, the cultural divides that already fracture our democracy are at risk of deepening.\nWe believe colleges must go beyond performative pluralism to foster the habits of curiosity, humility and collaboration. Pluralism isn\u2019t just a campus value. It\u2019s a civic necessity.\nThe Research Brief is a short take on interesting academic work."

What's key is a strategy to swiftly transfer lab findings to the bedside. In today's episode of Neuro Pathways, we're discussing critical collaborations between researchers and clinicians who have taken neuroscience bench research to clinical trials and development of novel therapeutics. I'm your host, Alex Rae-Grant, neurologist in Cleveland Clinic's Neurological Institute.\nToday I'm very pleased to be joined by Dr. Bruce Trapp. Dr. Trapp is the chairman of the Department of Neurosciences in Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute. Bruce, welcome to Neuro Pathways.\nBruce Trapp, PhD: Well, a pleasure to be here and thank you Alex and the NI for inviting me to participate in this.\nAlex Rae-Grant, MD: Bruce, I've known you for quite a while, but before we get started, why don't you help our listeners get to know you a bit more. Where are you from and how did your career lead to the Cleveland Clinic?\nBruce Trapp, PhD: Yeah, well originally I'm from Northern Illinois, about 90 miles west of Chicago. Got my education in Chicago, my PhD at Loyola University School of Medicine, and then I went to the NIH in Washington DC, or Bethesda, specifically. Spent nine years there. First faculty position was Johns Hopkins in the Department of Neurology, and then 26 years ago I came to the Cleveland Clinic to chair a new department, the Department of Neurosciences.\nAlex Rae-Grant, MD: Well, I'll tell you what, with 20 years plus leading the Department of Neurosciences at Lerner, can you start the discussion by telling our listeners the prominent research role that you and your team have played at Cleveland Clinic?\nBruce Trapp, PhD: Yeah, I think one of the philosophies I brought back in 1994, some time ago, in starting a basic neuroscience department, was that I wanted to focus on human disease. It was not a popular thing back in those days to have a basic science department focus on human disease, but it's probably one of the main reasons I took the job at the Cleveland Clinic. Again, my research interests being multiple sclerosis, MS, the Mellen Center had one of the biggest MS programs in North America if not the world. So this just opened an opportunity to really jumpstart a clinical research program in MS that included the Department of Neurosciences and hopefully that I could then recruit people in other CNS or peripheral nerve diseases as part of the faculty.\nAlex Rae-Grant, MD: We know your team's led neurosciences for a number of years in multiple fronts, particularly in MS. Can you talk about some of the many successes, including recent identification of a new subtype of MS?\nBruce Trapp, PhD: I think if we look back from the beginning of this program, and I'd like to just mention that one of the things that have made us successful is our autopsy program. So we study MS by studying MS, and that takes an awful lot of coordination with the neurologists at the Mellen Center, radiologists in the Radiology Institute and BME. But probably the first major impact we made was to describe neurodegeneration in MS, and I always thought it was a disease of myelin and the axons were spirit. That's what all the textbooks showed, and we, as well as others, we weren't the only one, but we really catalyzed this effort to describe neurodegeneration and MS, and that loss of neurons or axons was probably the major cause of permanent neurological disability in the disease. And so that was a seminal finding, I think the number-one cited paper in all of MS research still, and that was published in '98, a long time ago.\nBut then we have carried on that entrance trying to figure out how neurons and axons may die in MS. Are there therapeutic targets there that we could treat? We know the anti-inflammatory therapies do very well. They slow the disease but they don't stop it. So we're looking for additional targets, additional therapies, and the neuron and the axon is that therapy. So our most recent observation, we always thought the neurodegeneration was a consequence of demyelination, but we presented data last year in a subgroup of MS patients that they had neurodegeneration without demyelination. So providing the first evidence, or among the first evidence, that separates demyelination and neurodegeneration. And so now we're trying to figure out the potential mechanisms of that neuronal loss.\nAlex Rae-Grant, MD: And I know that we in the MS field struggle with the degenerative component, and how to work on that and how to explain that to our patients. Why are their MRI scans pretty steady and they feel the relentless decline? So I know that's a very important field of endeavor. Let me ask you, when we think about the collaboration, it's moving from the basic sciences to research to treating patients. How do you see that pathway connecting and moving forward?\nBruce Trapp, PhD: You often hear this bench-to-bed theory of doing MS, and I think we have a modification of that here. It's really bench to the patient, but we start with the patient, and that's where my interactions with the Mellen Center and the neurologist there, so they have a great command of this disease and they ask their patients if they would donate their brain and spinal cord to our research program. And I think we've done about 180 some now. And this has made a huge difference in our understanding of the brain. So I look at our research as going from patient to bench and then back to patients. So the best way to study MS is to study MS and that is to get our hands on these brains and spinal cord and try to figure what's going on. We've been very successful in that. We've identified targets. I don't think we have no drugs in clinic yet, but we're in the pipeline to try to do that. Either to stop the neuro degeneration or to repair the myelin, which are the two major new targets out there right now.\nAlex Rae-Grant, MD: We know at the clinic it's really a multidisciplinary set of approaches to things. How do you see that working between the research side and the clinical side, that multidisciplinary component?\nBruce Trapp, PhD: It's an absolute necessity today, particularly if you're going to try to have relevance to the clinical disease. We absolutely need the neurologists, so they do more than sign up these patients, they see our data that we generate. And their input into the interpretation of that data is really why we can publish in the New England Journal of Medicine and not the Journal of Neuroscience. Well, there's nothing wrong with the Journal of Neuroscience, but without this input from the clinicians, we would not have the same impact, not only in generating the data, but interpreting and putting it in context of the disease. The same can be said with the Imaging Institute and BM members that do all the brain imaging. We're leaders in brain imaging here. We're trying very hard to figure out what these brain images mean as far as pathology. And we're sitting on the cutting edge. So this recent paper we had, there was individuals from Mellen Center, the Imaging Institute, BME and neuroscience, all on the same paper. So it's teamwork. You've got to work together. Same common goal. And I've been very fortunate to be in an atmosphere where everyone plays together quite well on that team.\nAlex Rae-Grant, MD: So I think what's interesting in MS, or one of the many interesting things, we had heard all along that it's a white matter disease and now we know that the gray matter is critically involved. And where you thought it was an inflammatory disease and now we know that it's a degenerative disease. We used to think it was a T-cell disease and now we know it's a B-cell disease as well as many other effectors. So what we're learning is overturning what we used to think we knew. Is there a lot of things that you've learned that changed your mind about MS over time?\nBruce Trapp, PhD: Well, yeah. I mean, I really was trained as a myelin biologist and interested in the cell biology of myelin, did a lot on inherited diseases of peripheral nervous system, but MS is a different disease and we don't know what causes it. We know that MS has the immune component that's very important. We have 17 or 18 FDA-approved therapies now to reduce inflammation, demyelination, but we don't stop the disease. And so there's things about it we don't know, and of course gray matter pathology is one of them.\nWe and others have described the demyelination of the gray matter, the cortex, cerebral cortex, being very important. Unfortunately we do not see that in routine imaging scans. Fields are making progress in that, so I'm hope they'll see something soon, but we have no way of judging what that cortical lesion load is in the MS patient. And now evidence that neurons may degenerate without demyelination, How do you have a marker for that? So we keep learning. I think we have to keep studying the MS brain and we have to model aspects of that so we may be able to learn pathways, but I think we're now starting to see in the pipeline, across the country, not just from our stuff, targets being identified and drugs coming into phase-one therapy that either will be neuroprotective or will promote repair, which are the two new targets for the field.\nAlex Rae-Grant, MD: Obviously you look ahead as to what's the next three to five years for your lab and for the collaboration. Are there some new things you can point our audience to that you're planning on the horizon?\nBruce Trapp, PhD: Well, these patients that have very little brain demyelination and neurodegeneration, we're trying to get at the mechanisms of neurodegeneration. So we're very deep in the trenches to that right now, using some very novel technologies like single-cell RNA sequence to 10x technology. We're just getting into that right now, so hopefully this may provide us some insight into what are some of the mechanisms of neurodegeneration independent of the deep myelination possibly that's going on, and we could get some therapeutic targets. We're still trying to develop imaging modalities. We're not doing the imaging, but we're doing the pathology on that that can identify demyelination in the white matter and in the cerebral cortex.\nThe other thing that was part of our endeavors towards the myelocortical MS was they had MRI changes. Couldn't distinguish them from typical patients. The only difference was the MRI changes in the white matter were not demyelinated, so we know there's false positives for that if you assume that these images are demyelinated most of the time, but not all the time. Important. It's very important. If we're going to develop remyelinating therapies, we have to have an imaging baseline of demyelination when we put the patient on the drug. And if we have a 20% error, which our data would say at least occurs, you're never going to see a beneficial effect if you use white-matter MRI imaging, or it's going to be extremely difficult. So we've got to improve. I'm optimistic. The hardware's improving tremendously, and this is a very young science. MRIs haven't been around since, what, early 80s? So plenty of room for expansion and improvement there.\nAlex Rae-Grant, MD: So we're always learning new things and moving forward.\nBruce Trapp, PhD: Always.\nAlex Rae-Grant, MD: So you've shared some great insights with us, Bruce, but before we sign off, anything else you particularly wanted to share with our audience about this whole field?\nBruce Trapp, PhD: Well, yeah, I mean, I think there's two points that I look back now on since I've been here that really have helped us succeed, and I mean us in a group. And one is being associated with the NI and having these wonderful neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, to really help integrate our data into the disease. And without that support, we'd have never made the impact or the discoveries, I don't think, that we have done. And the second thing is the Lerner Research Institute has provided an awful lot of support for our program. We've been the model system. I mean, I think there are many there now, but when we started in the mid-90s we were the model system that the Cleveland Clinic would want to see as integrate programs in human disease. And so I'm very proud of that and proud of the colleagues, Rich Rudic, Bob Fox, Dan Ontaneda. And now it's just another string of neurologists that keep keeping us going and I've been very fortunate to be associated with those folks.\nAlex Rae-Grant, MD: We've been very fortunate to have you with us, Bruce. Well, thank you for joining us and we'll look forward to seeing how your work continues to develop and hopefully it'll help with the care of patient neurological diseases for many years to come.

  "argos_summary": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is driven by both genetics and environmental factors, with recent research highlighting the gut microbiome as a key contributor.  In 2025, scientists found that the ratio of Bifidobacterium adolescentis to Akkermansia muciniphila in the gut predicts MS severity, with a lower ratio indicating more severe disease.  Human studies showed MS patients have higher Blautia and lower Prevotella, while mouse models confirmed that an imbalance favoring Akkermansia over Bifidobacterium worsens inflammation and MS\u2011like symptoms.  These findings suggest that the Bifidobacterium\u2011to\u2011Akkermansia ratio could serve as a biomarker for diagnosis and treatment, though further research is needed to determine whether altering these microbes can modify disease progression.
