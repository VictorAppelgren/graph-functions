      "summary": "Bitcoin's price fell over 4% to just above $117,700 after reaching a record high of $124,436 earlier in the day, influenced by a surprising 0.9% increase in wholesale prices reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This rise in prices has dampened optimism for a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. Meanwhile, Ether approached its all-time high, with analysts predicting significant growth due to favorable regulatory developments. The broader cryptocurrency market has seen gains this year amid regulatory optimism, particularly under the Trump administration.",
