      "feedback": "Overall, the draft sensibly threads policy, auto capex, and productivity into a 3–6 month lens but falls short of a tight, world‑class trigger map and quantified transmission. Actionable edits: 1) Replace the narrative paragraph with a crisp catalyst map explicitly dated to 3–6 months, listing triggers (tariff timeline: 25% on imported passenger vehicles in April 2025 and 25% on auto parts in May 2025; GM’s stated $4B US manufacturing push and GM’s 10–12B capital spend cadence through 2027; Cadillac Elevated Velocity milestones and Terra/e‑Velocity mode activation; dealer AI‑pricing/CRM uptake; HeartSciences FDA/regulatory milestones; Pacaso/mogul/Gameflip expansion timelines) and invalidations (tariff relief, policy reversal, or softer auto demand alongside a failed capex ramp). 2) Strengthen the causal chain: show how policy shocks compress margins for importers, trigger dealer AI pricing and inventory/discounting strategies, lift near‑term capex intensity, and domestically bias supply, while AI‑driven productivity (Range’s 1–1.5% annual uplift) provides a ballast for margins and tax receipts; knit this to GM’s profit/demand signals (GM’s published capex cadence and US production plans) and to Cadillac Velocity’s market signaling. 3) Quantify clearly with source‑backed anchors: cite GM capex (4B domestic, 10–12B total through 2027), GM production targets (2M U.S. annual output uplift capability; Orion/Spring Hill and other plants), Pacaso expansion (10 new international destinations; 21% annual growth in co‑ownership; 22% of revenue from Europe/Mexico; 1.8T addressable vacation‑home market), Range/AI productivity (1–1.5% annual GDP productivity lift; 78M new AI‑driven jobs forecast), and relevant consumer dynamics (40% of Americans want a vacation home). 4) End with a tight base case, 1–2 alts, explicit risks, and a watch‑list with trigger levels: base case: 3–6 months of sustained EV capex momentum and AI adoption leading to a modest autos/tech bid; alt 1: premium EV/real‑asset platforms (Pacaso/mogul‑style) benefiting from expansion and high cash‑flow yields; alt 2: AI‑enabled wealth platforms gaining traction as productivity passes through to earnings; risks: tariff escalation, faster‑than‑expected rate normalization tightening autos demand, or a delay in AI adoption that dampens dispersion; watch signals: GM capex cadence and production guidance, Elevated Velocity progress, tariff timelines and AI adoption milestones at dealers, HeartSciences’ FDA/clinical milestones as a sentiment proxy, and value‑sector pricing signals (e.g., Douglas Tires durability signals as a consumer‑durables proxy). 5) Tighten sourcing discipline: annotate every assertion with the exact source IDs (WTNT85IPR for Cadillac/GM/Electrics; GM for capital and output; UPV3X2MQ6 for FIRE/alternative investments and RangePacaso/Mogul/Gameflip; V8TEZOR8R for consumer/durables signal; EPJYXB7DX for RNC/policy framing when invoked; ILYC1M41F/UPV3X2MQ6 for Barista FIRE context) and reconcile conflicts explicitly (tariffs help domestic manufacturing but raise price risk; GM’s US capex vs tariff margins; AI tools cushion dealer pricing but depend on data flows and adoption speed). This will yield a coherent, testable, 3–6 month scenario with a transparent path‑dependency, timing windows, and an evidence‑driven confidence level.",
