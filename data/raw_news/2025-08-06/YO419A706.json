  "title": "Many Delaware beachgoers feel the sting of a blooming jellyfish population",
  "description": "More beachgoers have been getting an unexpected shock this summer as jellyfish numbers bloom along the Delaware coast",
  "content": "Jellyfish blooms have become common from Maine to Florida in recent years. Warming waters can create ideal conditions for jellyfish growth.\n\nNormally, Delaware\u2019s five state parks may report a handful of summer jellyfish stings, said Bailey Noel, a beach patrol captain. But Fenwick Island State Park recently reported 92 stings on a single July day. Three lifeguards were taken to urgent care after swimming in jellyfish-infested waters, Noel said.\n\nThe jellyfish at Delaware\u2019s Towers Beach surprised Philadelphia resident Christina Jones, whose two daughters refused to wade back into the water after being stung, she said.\n\n\u201cThe jellyfish are pretty bad,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd not only are they a lot in number, but they\u2019re pretty big.\u201d\n\nDelaware State Beach Patrol started tracking jellyfish stings this year due to the rise in cases, said Noel. Most patrol teams do not track the data.\n\nLewes Beach Patrol treated 295 stings in 2024, the first year the data was collected, but reported over 1,200 cases so far in 2025, said Capt. Strohm Edwards. Lifeguards started carrying vinegar solutions, which can neutralize the venom agents, to help ease pain, he said.\n\nBut vinegar solutions may cause microscopic venom-coated barbs known as nematocysts to discharge, according to some research. Those experts recommend a baking soda slurry.\n\nWhile venomous, stings from Delaware's lion\u2019s manes and sea nettles typically only cause minor irritation and pain, said Edwards. In cases of severe allergic reactions and symptoms \u2014 nausea, vomiting and trouble breathing \u2014 lifeguards can help.\n\nJellyfish blooms, sudden fluctuations in jellyfish populations, are not uncommon, said Gisele Muller-Parker, a retired marine biologist who would count dozens of lion\u2019s mane jellyfish during her daily Lewes Beach walks in July. Temperature, salinity and food availability influence jellyfish breeding, and in favorable conditions, such as warmer waters, populations can explode.\n\n\u201cThis year, we\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Muller-Parker said.\n\nThe jellyfish were near the end of their life cycle, finishing their reproductive phase and laying their eggs. Those jellyfish will die once water temperatures cool, said Keith Bayha, a research collaborator with the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History.\n\nThe jellyfish boom can harm ecosystems and marine industries, said Bayha, who has studied the animals for more than 20 years and helped identify a nettle species. Fish larvae primarily feed on plankton, but jellyfish can eat both the plankton and the fish. And with few natural predators, the jellyfish food chain is an ecological dead end, said Bayha.\n\nDelaware's boom this summer is far from alone. Florida's Volusia County reported hundreds of stings around Memorial Day weekend. Gloucester, Massachusetts, reminded beachgoers to stay safe around jellyfish in mid-July. And in June, Maine's Ogunquit Fire Department warned beachgoers about the increase in jellyfish after stings were reported.\n\nJellyfish research is limited, but Muller-Parker hopes more work will be done to assess the ecological ramifications of jellyfish blooms and improve safety advisories.\n\nFor now, some unlucky beachgoers will have to rely on home remedies and, in the case of Massachusetts resident Kathy Malloy-Harder\u2019s third-grade nephew, a little bravery.\n\n\u201cWhen he got stung, he jumped up and started crying and said, \u2019I\u2019m never coming back to the beach again ever,\u2019\u201d said Malloy-Harder, who had to try two stores to find vinegar for him. But she said that after talking about it \u201cand once the sting subsided, he was interested in coming back and enjoying the beach.\u201d",

      "text": "Summer of Blob: Maine sees more big, stinging jellyfish\nPORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 Seaside New England is known for rocky shores, seafood shacks, chance whale sightings and, in recent months, lots of gooey, tentacled blobs.\nThe Gulf of Maine and some of its beaches, ever popular with tourists, have recorded a high number of sightings of a big jellyfish that has the ability to sting swimmers and occasionally does.\nThe lion\u2019s mane jellyfish, the largest known variety, can grow to five or more feet across, with tentacles more than 100 feet long.\nSuch giant jellyfish are uncommon, but beachgoers say larger than average ones have been exceptionally plentiful this year in the gulf, which touches Maine, two other states and two Canadian provinces.\nBecky Rice-Barnes of Mariaville and her husband Jimmy were out digging for claims at Maine\u2019s Lamoine Beach recently when they found a five-foot specimen washed ashore.\n\u201cMy husband said you\u2019re not going to believe what\u2019s over here, and I didn\u2019t,\u201d Rice-Barnes said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen red jellyfish before, we\u2019ve just never seen a red jellyfish that\u2019s huge.\u201d\nJellyfish are tracked each summer by Nick Record, a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, Maine. Typically fewer than half the jellyfish reported are lion\u2019s manes. This year, almost all of several hundred jellyfish observed were the lion\u2019s mane variety. The exact number of total jellyfish sightings isn\u2019t available yet, but Record said it\u2019s on pace to be in the typical range of 300 to 700.\nUnlike other jellyfish common off Maine, they\u2019re not entirely translucent. In the water, they resemble a drifting fireball, and when washed on land they can collapse into a mess that resembles a bloody crime scene.\nRecord takes reports about jellyfish encounters via a website , the Jellyfish Reporter, that allows beachgoers and boaters to provide details about sightings. A couple of lion\u2019s manes five or six feet across, and many have been a foot and a half to two feet.\nThe lion\u2019s mane lives in cold waters in many parts of the world. The jellyfish uses its tentacles to capture prey, and its sting can be painful to humans, though not typically life-threatening. At least five swimmers in Maine have reported stings this year.\n\u201cJust a gigantic, scary jellyfish that you would not want to run into in the water,\u201d Record said of larger lion\u2019s manes. \u201cIt has been kind of a steady stream of them all summer.\u201d\nWhile anecdotal reports of jellyfish, including lion\u2019s manes, are more common in recent years, it\u2019s hard to know if there really are more than usual in the Gulf of Maine because good historic date is lacking, said Andy Pershing, chief scientific officer with Gulf of Maine Research Institute.\nIf there are more large lion\u2019s mane jellyfish, Record said one possible reason is that the Gulf of Maine is warming faster than most of the world\u2019s oceans, and the jellyfish can grow faster in warmer water.\nRecord advises swimmers and others to use caution when they come upon the buoyant blobs.\n\u201cEvery once in a while I get pictures of people holding a lion\u2019s mane jellyfish,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\n___\nFollow Patrick Whittle on Twitter: @pxwhittle"

Factors such as warming waters and favorable conditions have led to a rise in jellyfish populations, including the lion's mane jellyfish, which can grow exceptionally large. This summer has seen over 1,200 stings reported in Delaware alone, raising concerns about the ecological impact and safety of beachgoers.",
