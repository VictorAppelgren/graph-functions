  "title": "What to Know About Visas For Foreign Truckers and the Politics of a Deadly Florida Crash",
  "description": "The federal government halts issuing work visas to immigrant commercial truck drivers, citing road safety concerns.",
  "content": "He provided no details Thursday in his two-sentence post on the social platform X, leaving some in the trucking industry wondering if many drivers would be affected. But the announcement appeared to be as much about politics as road safety, coming as a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver became increasingly politicized, with the offices of two ambitious governors battling publicly over responsibility.\n\nWith the Florida crash spilling into national politics, here\u2019s what you should know: Will many drivers be affected? It depends how you define \u201cmany,\u201d and the exact number isn\u2019t clear. But it appears that at most a few thousand of the country\u2019s estimated 3.5 million commercial truck drivers would be affected by the new directive.\n\nThe pause is aimed at drivers applying for three types of visas, the State Department said Friday, most notably the H-2B visa for temporary workers. Only roughly 1,500 visas for truck drivers were issued this fiscal year under the program, and 1,400 last year, according to Jeff Joseph, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. The program has helped offset what many observers see as a persistent shortage of commercial drivers.\n\nBut H-2B visas are capped for most years at 66,000, with drivers making up only a couple percent of the total. The other two visa categories listed by the State Department are the E-2, for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business, and the EB-3, which is for skilled workers such as health care employees, IT professionals and skilled tradespeople like electricians.\n\nThe Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, a trade association representing small-business truck drivers, applauded the administration for \u201cseeing through the myth of a truck driver shortage and continuing efforts to restore commonsense safety standards on our nation\u2019s highways.\u201d The association dismisses talk of scarcity, saying there are often independent truckers available but companies prefer drivers who cost less. Jerry Maldonado of the Laredo Motor Carriers Association, a group of 200 trucking companies operating on both sides of the southern border, was relieved when the State Department released more details about Rubio\u2019s announcement.\n\nMexican and Canadian drivers operate in the U.S. with B-1 visas, he said, which allow non-U.S. citizens to enter the country briefly. Some worried those visas could also be paused. \u201cThe announcement did scare some people, but I\u2019m glad for the clarification,\u201d Maldonado said. Rubio\u2019s announcement came after three people were killed when truck driver Harjinder Singh made an illegal U-turn on a highway, according to the state\u2019s Highway Patrol.\n\nA nearby minivan slammed into Singh\u2019s trailer as he made the turn. Singh and his passenger were not injured. The Department of Homeland Security said Monday that Singh, a native of India, was in the country illegally. The crash quickly turned political, with supporters of Florida\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, blaming California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom.\n\nBoth men have been mentioned as possible presidential contenders. Homeland Security said Singh obtained a commercial driver\u2019s license in California, one of 19 states that issues licenses regardless of immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center. \u201cThree lives lost because of Gavin Newsom. Because of California\u2019s failed policies,\u201d Florida Lt. Gov. Jay Collins said Thursday at a news conference in Stockton, California.\n\nSingh, who flew to California after the Aug. 12 crash, was arrested by U.S. Marshals in that city. DeSantis sent Collins to California to oversee Singh\u2019s return to Florida, where he is charged with three counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations. Collins, accompanied by law enforcement personnel, escorted Singh onto the plane. A Newsom spokesperson called Collins\u2019 trip a \u201cphoto op\u201d and criticized Florida officials for letting a \u201cmurder suspect walk.\u201d",

      "text": "DeSantis picks state Sen. Jay Collins to be Florida\u2019s lieutenant governor\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis tapped Republican state Sen. Jay Collins to be his next lieutenant governor Tuesday. It\u2019s a closely watched appointment by the two-term governor, who can\u2019t run for reelection in 2026 and has been working to cement his legacy as his time leading the state winds down.\nIf Collins, an Army combat veteran and nonprofit executive, decides to launch a bid to succeed DeSantis, the move could tee up another proxy fight between the popular GOP governor and President Donald Trump, who has already endorsed U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds for the job.\nDuring a news conference announcing his pick at the Green Beret Association in Tampa on Tuesday, DeSantis praised Collins as an \u201cally\u201d and a principled conservative.\n\u201cWhat I was looking for is someone that can be lieutenant governor that will help us deliver more wins for the people of Florida \u2014 and then also that is capable of serving and leading as governor, if that need were ever to arise,\u201d the governor said during the news conference in Tampa, which Collins represents.\nCollins was sworn in minutes after the announcement, with his wife Layla and their two young sons at his side, while the governor and first lady Casey DeSantis looked on.\nCollins pledged to help deliver on DeSantis\u2019 agenda, which he said has made Florida the country\u2019s \u201cconservative proving grounds.\u201d\n\u201cThe goal is to help him finish the mission and keep Florida strong,\u201d Collins said of DeSantis, adding, \u201cyou don\u2019t flinch when the next mission comes up. You just say, \u2018Yes, sir. Let\u2019s go.\u2019\u201d\nBorn in Montana, Collins has talked openly about personal challenges he has overcome, including experiencing homelessness while in high school. He went on to join the Army Special Forces and ultimately lost a leg, but continued to serve five more years as a Green Beret using a prosthetic leg post-amputation, according to a campaign biography.\nTaking the stage Tuesday, Collins made light of the injury he sustained, saying he was proud to serve the country that afforded him so many opportunities.\n\u201cI want you to know that I\u2019ve got my sleeves rolled up, I\u2019ve got my running leg on, and we are ready to get things done,\u201d Collins said.\nIn recent years, Collins has served as the chief operating officer of Operation BBQ Relief, which deploys cooks and mobile kitchens to deliver hot meals in the aftermath of natural disasters. In June, Collins also flew to Israel to help support state-funded flights to evacuate Americans as Israel and Iran traded missile strikes.\n\u201cWhy would you want to go in to Israel when Iran is raining rockets down? Most people would take a pass on that,\u201d DeSantis said of Collins, calling him \u201cthe Chuck Norris of Florida politics.\u201d\nThe seat had been vacant since February, when then-lieutenant governor Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez was appointed to lead one of the state\u2019s public universities. In Florida, the lieutenant governor position is largely ceremonial with few official responsibilities, apart from taking over if the governor cannot serve.\nCollins was first elected to Florida\u2019s Republican-dominated state Senate in 2022 and has been seen as one of DeSantis\u2019 key allies in the Legislature. In recent months, GOP legislators loyal to the president have increasingly sparred with the governor, who challenged Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.\nThe appointment is seen as a way for DeSantis to elevate a potential successor in 2026, though the governor has repeatedly talked up his wife, Casey DeSantis, for the job, while taking shots at Trump\u2019s pick.\n___\nKate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

      "text": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s national profile soars with latest Trump fight, but there are risks\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Gavin Newsom is having a moment.\nIn the national struggle over U.S. House control, perhaps no politician has more at stake than the California governor, who has emerged as the leading Democratic adversary to President Donald Trump in what many see as a lightly masked trial run for his own future White House bid.\nThe liberal former San Francisco mayor, who is nearing the end of a spotty tenure in Sacramento, is being cheered by Democrats and party activists who see his scrappy, Trump-mocking, profanity-tinged speeches and snarky social media posts as signs of new life in a party left dispirited and rudderless after 2024 election losses.\nNewsom \u201chas been doing what I\u2019ve wanted a Democrat to do for a long time,\u201d radio host Charlamagne Tha God said on his syndicated \u201cBreakfast Club\u201d program. In directly confronting the president Newsom is \u201cmatching energy, and I like it.\u201d\nDemocratic pollster Ben Tulchin said Newsom is benefitting from a torrent of national media exposure that \u201cmakes him look like a leader, portraying strength.\u201d\nIn a party that even many of its own members describe as ineffective and weak, Newsom is challenging Trump and \u201cpunching the bully in the nose,\u201d added Tulchin, who worked for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaigns. With 16 months left in his final term \u2014 a time in his tenure when many governors would be seen as fading away \u2014 he\u2019s \u201cdriving the conversation.\u201d\nBut Newsom\u2019s strategy is not without risk as he plans to ask voters in a November special election to approve new House districts. The new maps have been jiggered to add five Democratic U.S. House seats in California to offset Trump\u2019s moves in Texas to gain five Republican districts before the 2026 midterm elections.\nThe faceoff between California and Texas is spreading nationally, and other states could soon begin redrawing House maps, which are crafted state by state. That could lead to an even more deeply partisan Washington, which already is strangled by gridlock.\nNewsom \u2018Should be ashamed\u2019 with political maneuvers\nWhile Newsom\u2019s maneuvers may be winning plaudits from the Democratic base, \u201cThis is a train wreck,\u201d said Boyd Brown, a former Democratic National Committee member and legislator from South Carolina.\nIf states follow Texas and California and keep rigging House maps for partisan advantage \u201cthat\u2019s a good way to ruin a democratic process,\u201d Brown said, adding the Democrats could end up disadvantaged nationally since Republicans control more than half of the state legislatures.\nNewsom and Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott \u201cshould be ashamed of what they are doing\u201d Brown added. \u201cWe are going to have a polarized Congress for decades to come,\u201d he said. \u201cWho does that benefit?\u201d\n\u201cIt is government malpractice at its highest level,\u201d he added. \u201cIt should concern every American.\u201d\nRisk for Newsom in what could lead to 2028 campaign\nFor Newsom, an election win in November would be a springboard for his national ambitions, with the fundraising he\u2019s doing ahead of the November election building out his list of national supporters. But a loss in his heavily Democratic home state would inevitably dim his luster on the national stage, even if Democrats give him credit for trying.\nAnd if new House maps are approved by voters, there\u2019s no guarantee Democrats will prevail in the reshaped districts in 2026, when Republicans will be trying to defend their party\u2019s fragile House majority. A loss of the House would dramatically alter the prospects for Trump\u2019s agenda in the latter half of his term.\nBut first, Newsom needs California voters to approve the new maps, which some see as no sure thing.\n\u201cRepublicans vote in higher propensity in elections that are off cycle,\u201d noted Democratic consultant Bill Burton, referring to this fall\u2019s special election.\nThat means Newsom \u201cis going to face that kind of natural pressure in this one,\u201d said Burton, who was national press secretary for Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be easy.\u201d\nA snarky social media style gets national attention\nNewsom\u2019s salesmanship for his plan for new House districts has come when he has been elevating his profile on social media \u2014 his press office account has gotten national attention parroting Trump\u2019s all-capital-letter posts peppered with off-color jokes and dismissive comments about the president.\n\u201cWOW!!! MY MAPS (THE BEST MAPS EVER MADE) WILL SOON PASS IN THE GREATEST LEGISLATURE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD (NOT JUST AMERICA). AMERICA CAN THANK ME,\u201d his press office riffed in a recent tweet.\nIt\u2019s part of a longer political evolution that has seen the governor edge toward the political center while welcoming conservatives \u2014 including Steve Bannon, an architect of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign \u2014 to his podcast.\nNewsom \u201cis sort of mixing the funny posts and the hysterical digs at the Trump administration with actual action. And I think that\u2019s the part that people are really appreciating and getting behind,\u201d said Lindsay Meyer-Harley, an online clothing retailer behind Still We Rise, an Instagram page promoting progressive agenda.\nAt a recent rally in Los Angeles, Newsom veered away from discussing the technical grist of reshaping districts and instead depicted the looming battle as a conflict with all things Trump, tying it explicitly to the fate of American democracy and echoing the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stand back and watch this democracy disappear district by district all across the country,\u201d Newsom warned.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Tran Nguyen in Sacramento, Calif., contributed."

U.S. Marshals arrested him Saturday in Stockton.\nCollins personally escorted Singh onto an airplane Thursday, holding the man\u2019s arm as he walked up the steps of the aircraft. Singh was accompanied by four other people, including a man in a jacket that read Police ERO, a reference to Enforcement and Removal Operations, a branch of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nSingh made the illegal turn on the highway about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of West Palm Beach, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. A minivan in the neighboring lane was unable to avoid the truck\u2019s trailer and slammed into it, killing the minivan\u2019s driver and two passengers.\nSingh and a passenger in his truck were not injured.\nFlorida authorities said Singh entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico in 2018.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin disputed that, saying the federal government denied him a permit during Trump\u2019s first term in September 2020 and granted him one in June 2021, under President Joe Biden.\nA preliminary investigation by the U.S. Department of Transportation found that Washington state issued Singh a regular full-term commercial driver\u2019s license in July 2023, a type of license that people without legal status are not eligible for, according to DOT.\nCalifornia then issued Singh a limited-term commercial license a year later. Federal vehicle safety officials are investigating whether the issuance of that license complied with government regulations.\nSingh is charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations. The federal government has asked that he be transferred to ICE custody after his criminal case is complete.\nA public defender assigned to Singh\u2019s case confirmed he made an appearance in San Joaquin County court on Tuesday.\n\u201cMr. Singh was in court on Tuesday afternoon and he signed the paperwork that acknowledged he was the person Florida was looking for but did not in any way admit to any criminal charges,\u201d attorney Jennifer Perkins said in an emailed statement.\nPerkins said she was \u201cnot at liberty\u201d to discuss Singh\u2019s citizenship status.\n___\nKate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

      "text": "Trump administration is reviewing all 55 million foreigners with US visas for any violations\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration said Thursday it is reviewing more than 55 million people who have valid U.S. visas for any violations that could lead to deportation, part of a growing crackdown on foreigners who are permitted to be in the United States.\nIn a written answer to a question from The Associated Press, the State Department said all U.S. visa holders, which can include tourists from many countries, are subject to \u201ccontinuous vetting,\u201d with an eye toward any indication they could be ineligible for permission to enter or stay in the United States.\nShould such information be found, the visa will be revoked, and if the visa holder is in the United States, he or she would be subject to deportation.\nSince President Donald Trump took office, his administration has focused on deporting migrants illegally in the United States as well as holders of student and visitor exchange visas. The State Department\u2019s new language suggests that the continual vetting process, which officials acknowledge is time-consuming, is far more widespread and could mean even those approved to be in the U.S. could abruptly see those permissions revoked.\nThere were 12.8 million green-card holders and 3.6 million people in the U.S. on temporary visas last year, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\nThe 55 million figure suggests that some people subject to review would currently be outside the United States with multiple-entry tourist visas, said Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute. She questioned the value of spending resources on people who may never return to the United States.\nThe State Department said it was looking for indicators of ineligibility, including people staying past the authorized timeframe outlined in a visa, criminal activity, threats to public safety, engaging in any form of terrorist activity or providing support to a terrorist organization.\n\u201cWe review all available information as part of our vetting, including law enforcement or immigration records or any other information that comes to light after visa issuance indicating a potential ineligibility,\u201d the department said.\nNo more worker visas for commercial truck drivers\nThe U.S. also will stop issuing worker visas for commercial truck drivers, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday on X. He said the change was effective immediately.\n\u201cThe increasing number of foreign drivers operating large tractor-trailer trucks on U.S. roads is endangering American lives and undercutting the livelihoods of American truckers,\u201d Rubio posted.\nThe Trump administration in the past months has taken steps to enforce the requirement that truckers speak and read English proficiently. The Transportation Department said the aim is to improve road safety following incidents in which drivers\u2019 ability to read signs or speak English may have contributed to traffic deaths.\nThe State Department said later Thursday it was pausing the processing of these work visas to review its \u201cscreening and vetting protocols.\u201d\n\u201cEnsuring that every driver on our roads meets the highest standards is important to protecting the livelihoods of American truckers and maintaining a secure, resilient supply chain,\u201d the department said.\nEdward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said foreign workers have helped address a labor shortage of commercial truck drivers.\n\u201cThis action should be seen as part of a concerted effort by the administration to discourage American companies and other institutions like universities and hospitals from hiring and retaining foreign workers,\u201d Alden wrote in an email.\n\u201cThe goal here is not to target specific classes of workers, but to send the message to American employers that they are at risk if they are employing foreign workers. The economic consequences will be far larger than just visas being stripped from foreign workers in a few job categories.\u201d\nNew review of all visa holders is a major expansion\nThe administration has steadily imposed more restrictions and requirements on visa applicants, including requiring them to submit to in-person interviews. The review of all visa holders appears to be a significant expansion of what had initially been a process focused mainly on students who have been involved in what the government perceives as pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel activity.\nOfficials say the reviews will include all visa holders\u2019 social media accounts, law enforcement and immigration records in their home countries, along with any actionable violations of U.S. law committed while they were in the United States.\nThe reviews will include new tools for data collection on past, present and future visa applicants, including a complete scouring of social media sites made possible by new requirements introduced earlier this year. Those make it mandatory for privacy switches on cellphones and other electronic devices or apps to be turned off when an applicant appears for a visa interview.\n\u201cAs part of the Trump Administration\u2019s commitment to protect U.S. national security and public safety, since Inauguration Day the State Department has revoked more than twice as many visas, including nearly four times as many student visas, as during the same time period last year,\u201d the State Department said.\nThe vast majority of foreigners seeking to come to the U.S. require visas, especially those who want to study or work for extended periods. Among the exceptions for short-term tourist or business visits are citizens of the 40 mainly European and Asian countries belonging to the Visa Waiver Program, which grants those nationals a stay of up to three months without having to apply for a visa.\nBut large swaths of the world \u2014 including highly populated countries like China, India, Indonesia, Russia and most of Africa \u2014 are not part of the program, meaning their citizens must apply for and receive visas to travel to the United States.\nEarlier this week, the department said that since Trump returned to the White House, it has revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and violations of local, state and federal law, the vast majority of which were assault, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and support for terrorism.\nIt said about 4,000 of those 6,000 were due to actual infractions of laws and that approximately 200 to 300 visas were revoked for terrorism-related issues, including providing support for designated terrorist organizations or state sponsors of terrorism.\n___\nElliot Spagat in San Diego contributed.\n___"

      "text": "Truckers fear job loss as new English language rules take effect\nTrump\u2019s executive order on English proficiency for truckers, effective Wednesday, has drivers rushing to improve their skills and concerns about accent bias and job loss.(AP Video: Ted Shaffrey)\nLINDEN, New Jersey (AP) \u2014 At a trucking school in New Jersey, students are maneuvering 18-wheelers around traffic cones. Other future drivers look under hoods to perform safety checks, narrating as they examine steering hoses for cracks and leaks.\nAn instructor glides between speaking Spanish and English as he teaches Manuel Castillo, a native Spanish speaker, how to inspect a school bus. They\u2019re using a printed script of English phrases to practice what Castillo would say during a roadside inspection.\nBrushing up on English has taken on new urgency for future and current truck drivers after President Donald Trump issued an executive order saying truckers who don\u2019t read and speak the language proficiently would be considered unfit for service.\n\u201cA driver who can\u2019t understand English will not drive a commercial vehicle in this country. Period,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said last month while announcing enforcement guidelines that take effect on Wednesday.\nUpdated U.S. Department of Transportation procedures call for enhanced inspections to determine if commercial motor vehicle operators can reply to questions and directions in English, as well as understand highway traffic signs and electronic message boards.\nTruckers who learned English as a second language are concerned they may lose their jobs if they make a mistake or speak with a heavy accent while under questioning. Some have worked to improve their English fluency by taking classes, reciting scripts and watching instructional videos.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not the language that you prefer to use daily, you may get a little nervous and you may feel, \u2018What if I say the wrong thing?\u2019\u201d said Jerry Maldonado, chairman of the board of the Laredo Motor Carriers Association, a trade association in Laredo, Texas, that represents approximately 200 trucking companies. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be, at the end of the day, the interpretation of the officer, so that makes people nervous.\u201d\nThe guidance applies to truck and bus drivers engaged in interstate commerce. It aims to improve road safety following incidents in which truck drivers\u2019 inability to read signs or speak English may have contributed to traffic deaths, the Transportation Department said.\nEnglish requirement isn\u2019t new\nRequiring truck drivers to speak and read English isn\u2019t new, but the penalty for not meeting the proficiency standard is becoming more severe.\nTo get a commercial driver\u2019s license, applicants must pass a written test and be able to name the parts of a bus or truck in English as they check tire inflation, tread depth, lug nuts and coolants.\nThe revised policy reverses guidance issued nine years ago, near the end of then-President Barack Obama\u2019s final term, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. In 2016, the agency said drivers whose English skills were found lacking could receive a citation but not be prohibited from working. Before that, the penalty was getting placed on \u201cout-of-service status.\u201d\n\u201cWe have bridges that get hit because drivers don\u2019t understand the signs on the bridges for things like height clearance,\u201d Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association President Todd Spencer said.\nPracticing English phrases\nIn Laredo, a border city where many residents speak a mix of English and Spanish, Maldonado\u2019s association is offering free English classes on weekends to help truckers feel more confident in their ability to communicate.\n\u201cEverybody knows what a stop sign looks like,\u201d Maldonado said. \u201cBut if there\u2019s construction or if there is an accident five miles down the road, and they have to put up a sign \u2014 \u2018Caution, must exit now, road closed ahead,\u2019 and you are not able to read that or understand that, that could potentially be a safety issue.\u201d\nAt Driving Academy in Linden, New Jersey, multilingual instructors teach students how to inspect vehicle parts in their first language and then provide explanations in English, according to founder Jonathan Marques. The school created scripts so students could practice what to say if they\u2019re stopped, he said.\nStudents are advised to watch training videos as homework, while licensed truckers can listen to English language apps instead of music when they\u2019re on the road, Marques suggested.\nInstructor Paul Cuartas helps students prepare but worries that inspectors will now expect truckers and bus drivers to have perfect English. \u201cI\u2019m concerned because now for all the Spanish people it\u2019s more difficult,\u201d he said.\nCastillo, who moved to the U.S. from Ecuador in 1993, said he has no problem understanding English but has been watching videos to study industry terms. \u201cSome words I don\u2019t understand, but I try to learn more English,\u201d he said.\nAsked whether he supports the president\u2019s executive order, Castillo said he voted for Trump but doesn\u2019t agree with the president\u2019s push to deport some immigrants who haven\u2019t committed crimes.\n\u201cHe makes a lot of problems, especially for Hispanic people,\u201d Castillo said.\nGTR Trucking School in Detroit also has offered students ESL classes. Co-owner Al Myftiu drove a truck after moving to the U.S. from Albania in 1993. He said he wants to create a small book of phrases that truckers need to learn.\nFor students with a thick accent, \u201cI tell them, \u2018Slow down, speak slowly and people can understand you, and if you don\u2019t understand something, you can ask,\u2019\u201d Myftiu said.\nHow it will work\nRoadside inspections can be initiated over issues such as a faulty brake light or on a routine basis, and often take place at weigh stations.\nThe guidance directs inspectors who suspect a driver doesn\u2019t understand what they\u2019re saying to administer an English proficiency test, which includes both an interview and a highway traffic sign recognition component.\nIn the past, some drivers used translation apps to communicate with federal inspectors. The updated policy bars the use of interpreters, smartphones, cue cards or other aids during interviews.\nSeveral truck drivers taking a break at Flying J Travel Center in New Jersey said they support Trump\u2019s order, adding that drivers who heavily rely on translation programs probably wouldn\u2019t be able to read important signs.\n\u201cWe try to ask them questions about the business just to strike a conversation, ... and they\u2019re not able to communicate with us at all,\u201d Kassem Elkhatib, one of the drivers at Flying J, said.\nFear of discrimination\nIt\u2019s unclear how safety inspectors will decide whether a driver knows enough English because that portion of the instructions was redacted from the guidance distributed by Transportation Department.\nThe department advised motor carriers that drivers should be able to answer questions about shipping documents, the origin and destination of trips, and how long they\u2019ve been on duty.\nA trucker placed out of service and the company they work for are responsible for ensuring a language violation is corrected before the driver hits the highway again, the Transportation Department said.\nTruck drivers who practice the Sikh religion already face discrimination in hiring and at loading docks, according to Mannirmal Kaur, federal policy manager for Sikh Coalition, an advocacy group. Now they are worried about inspectors making subjective, non-standardized determinations about which of them are proficient in English, she said.\n\u201cA truck driver who does speak English sufficiently to comply with federal standards but maybe they speak with an accent, or maybe they use a different vocabulary that the inspector isn\u2019t used to hearing: Is that person then going to be subject to an English language violation?\u201d Kaur asked. \u201cAnd under the new policy, are they then going to be designated out-of-service, which could result in unemployment?\u201d\n___\nVideo journalist Mingson Lau contributed from Carneys Point Township, New Jersey."

The announcement came amid a deadly Florida crash involving illegal immigrant Harjinder Singh, which has sparked a public feud between Gov. Ron\u202fDeSantis and Gov. Gavin\u202fNewsom over immigration policy and driver licensing. DeSantis also named state Sen. Jay\u202fCollins as lieutenant governor, positioning him as a potential 2026 successor while Newsom pushes a controversial redistricting plan that could reshape congressional representation. The pause follows a broader Department of Homeland Security review of all U.S. visa holders for potential violations, reflecting a tightening of immigration enforcement.",
