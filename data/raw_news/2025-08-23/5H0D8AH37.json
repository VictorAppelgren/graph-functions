  "title": "Waymo Robotaxis Officially Testing in New York: Not Everyone Is Happy",
  "description": "Waymo will be permitted to test up to eight autonomous vehicles in parts of Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn until late September 2025, though public figures such as former Mayor Bill de Blasio are speaking out against the development.",
  "content": "Following successful rollouts in Austin and the Bay Area earlier this year, Waymo has been granted permission to begin testing a limited number of its robotaxis in parts of Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn, New York City.\n\nWith approval from the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT), Waymo will be permitted to test up to eight autonomous vehicles in these areas until late September 2025. After the pilot period, the Alphabet-owned company will have the opportunity to apply for an extension. Due to New York State's strict autonomous vehicle regulations, the robotaxis will still be required to have a trained AV specialist behind the wheel at all times.\n\nThough securing a foothold in one of America\u2019s largest cities would be a huge win for the company, not everyone is happy about Waymo\u2019s entrance into the market. Former Mayor Bill de Blasio slammed the approval in a post on X , writing: \u201cIf there\u2019s one place on Earth that was NOT meant for self-driving cars, it\u2019s NYC,\" calling it a \"really bad idea.\" Curtis Tate, Administrative Vice President of the Transport Workers Union, echoed the former mayor's concerns.\n\n\u201cNew York is America\u2019s most densely populated big city. There\u2019s a dizzying amount of activity from an unmatched number of pedestrians, bicyclists, pedicabs, and motorists,\" he said in the statement.\n\nTate warned the testing is a step toward \"eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs\" and would only \"make big tech bros even richer.\" However, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said his organization's requirements \"will help ensure that the development of this technology is focused, first and foremost, on the safety of everyone who shares our busy city streets.\u201d\n\nBut despite opposition from some quarters, Waymo has been continuing with its ambitious nationwide rollout in 2025. The company is currently testing its vehicles in Philadelphia, and is eyeing a 2026 rollout in Dallas, Texas, as well as Washington D.C. and Miami. The company claims to have completed over 10 million rides in five major US cities so far.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has closed its 14-month investigation into a series of 22 incidents involving self-driving Waymo vehicles, including 17 collisions.",

      "text": "May 5, 2025\nScaling our fleet through U.S. manufacturing\nThe U.S. is leading the world in the development and deployment of autonomous driving technology. Today, Waymo One provides more than 250,000 paid trips each week across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin, and we\u2019re preparing to bring our fully autonomous ride-hailing to Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C. in 2026. We\u2019re proud to bring this technology \u2013 once thought to be the stuff of science fiction \u2013 to more and more riders across this country.\nScaling Waymo One and meeting the increasing demand of our riders requires a growing fleet of vehicles integrated with our generalizable Waymo Driver. To support our growing U.S. ridership, we\u2019re investing in our American manufacturing operation with a new autonomous vehicle factory in Metro Phoenix with our partners at Magna.\nThe Waymo Driver integration plant will build thousands of Jaguar I-PACEs equipped with our fully autonomous technology, which we design and assemble in the U.S. At 239,000 square feet, this factory is a multi-million dollar investment and has created hundreds of jobs in Mesa, AZ that support our future growth plans.\n\"The new Waymo and Magna manufacturing facility in Mesa is the latest example of Arizona being the new home for technology to innovate and grow,\u201d said Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs. \u201cI\u2019m proud to see autonomous vehicles on our streets every day, helping get people where they need to be safely. The new manufacturing facility will enhance this presence, and the local jobs it's creating will help Arizona\u2019s tech economy continue to rise on the world stage.\u201d\nTooling up for growth\nWaymo One has grown substantially in the last couple of years. We\u2019ve also incrementally grown our commercial fleet as we\u2019ve welcomed more riders, with over 1,500 vehicles across San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Austin. Earlier this year, we received our final delivery from Jaguar, and through next year, we will build over 2,000 more fully autonomous I-PACE vehicles for our fleet.\n\u201cThe Waymo Driver integration plant in Mesa is the epicenter of our future growth plans,\u201d said Ryan McNamara, Vice President of Operations, Waymo. \u201cWith our partners at Magna, we\u2019ve opened a manufacturing site that enables the cost efficiency, flexibility, and capacity to scale our fleet to new heights.\u201d\nThis facility\u2019s flexible design also enables us to integrate the 6th-generation Waymo Driver on new vehicle platforms, beginning this year with the Zeekr RT. With the need to build multiple platforms simultaneously and at higher volumes, the plant will introduce an automated assembly line and other efficiencies over time. When the facility is operating at full capacity, it will be capable of building tens of thousands of fully autonomous Waymo vehicles per year.\nRider-ready from the factory\nAfter the Driver is installed, the system needs to be validated and commissioned before carrying riders. With this new facility, we recently implemented new processes and efficiencies at the end of line that significantly reduce the time and cost required to enable a vehicle to carry riders.\nThis new strategic capability allows vehicles assigned to our Phoenix fleet to drive themselves out of the facility and directly into service. In fact, these vehicles can pick up their first public passengers less than 30 minutes after leaving the factory. For vehicles intended for other cities, they can be deployed into public service in a matter of hours after being shipped to their local depot.\nThis new manufacturing plant, combined with more efficient vehicle launch processes, means we can serve more riders faster.
