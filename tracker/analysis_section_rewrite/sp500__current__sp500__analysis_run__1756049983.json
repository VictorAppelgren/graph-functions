      "feedback": "Strong starting points, but the piece needs a tighter, evidence‑driven 0–3 week thesis and clearer discipline around the causal chain. What to fix and how to fix it (actionable edits):\n- Build a crisp, explicit 0–3 week narrative with a single causal thread: (a) immediate drivers: Labor Day promos and late‑summer consumer momentum (cite Pottery Barn 20% off to $2,235; $2794 list; and related promos at Amazon/REI/HexClad) and (b) near‑term catalysts for growth names (Shopify GMV and revenue lift, Q2/H1 data; 163B GMV, ~$5B revenue; 22% post‑earnings move; valuation at ~70x forward P/E, ~18x P/S); (c) risk factors that could trigger a reversal (valuation pressure on high‑growth names; geopolitical risk impulse from the Moscow blast). Tie each step to a source ID after the claim (6U8VYS7BA for the Labor Day promos; 19NO2GMNF and QGXA2WQJ3 for Shopify metrics; NBX9RA9WX for the Moscow event). \n- Quantify and anchor every assertion in the horizon: quote exact figures (Pottery Barn price cut to $2,235 from $2,794; $559 savings; Labor Day promos “run through Sept. 1”); for Shopify, GMV $163B and revenue ~$5B in H1 2025; forward P/E ~70 and P/S ~18; Shopify’s 22% post‑earnings pop; note the 80% YTD context. Mark the magnitudes of potential moves (e.g., “Shopify needs mid‑to‑high‑20s revenue growth to sustain current multiples,” per the 70x/18x context) rather than generic adjectives.\n- Strengthen the base case with explicit catalysts and invalidation rules: base‑case if Labor Day momentum persists and Shopify maintains mid‑to‑high‑20s revenue growth guidance; upside if consumer prints beat and Shopify sustains GMV growth above trend; invalidate if Q2/Q3 guidance implies meaningfully lower growth or if a sharp multiple re‑rating occurs. Specify thresholds (e.g., if Shopify guidance for 2H24–23 shows <25% revenue growth or if rev/GMV growth slows meaningfully from ~27–29% YoY, trigger caution/rotations).\n- Tighten the near‑term risk overlay: treat the Moscow gas‑cylinder incident as a risk‑off shock channel rather than a peripheral headline; specify plausible channels (FX, energy, risk premia, equity volatility) and propose monitoring signals (USD strength, VIX, oil prices, risk‑sensitive tech multiple). Cite NBX9RA9WX as the event source and weave the potential cross‑asset impact into the “reaction function.”\n- Align with SECTION FOCUS: clearly articulate the “what to monitor next” and explicit levels/thresholds. Include concrete watchpoints: (i) Labor Day selling momentum into Sept 1; (ii) consumer data prints (confidence, retail/discount uptake) referenced by the promo season; (iii) Shopify’s next guidance/earnings read; (iv) the Moscow incident evolution and its cross‑asset spillover. Attach the exact source IDs to each point.\n- Reconcile conflicts and improve coverage: the Labor Day promo signals and Shopify’s growth momentum appear supportive, but the Fool/NASDAQ/Real‑money valuation narrative confirms high multiples that are vulnerable to any growth disappointments; ensure coverage of both sides (6U8VYS7BA for promos; 19NO2GMNF and QGXA2WQJ3 for Shopify; NBX9RA9WX for geopolitical risk). If using additional sources (HexClad/REI/APAC promos), cite them only if you tie them to a quantifiable near‑term impulse; otherwise omit to avoid dilution.\n- Presentation and formatting: reduce hedges and multi‑thread prose; present a tight causal chain with numbered bullets or a compact flow, but keep to IDs after each factual claim (no stray or unsupported numbers). Ensure every numeric assertion maps to a source ID and avoid mixing in NBA/N,BOL sources unless you explicitly link them to risk sentiment or liquidity considerations.\n- Output discipline: in the rewrite, replace the generic “constructive/negative” framing with explicit numerics, thresholds, and sensitivity analysis. A clean 0–3 week framework would read as: drivers (Labor Day promos; Shopify metrics) → catalysts (promotional cadence; guidance) → reaction function (stock/credit/consumption path) → thresholds (growth rate targets, multiple compression risk) → monitoring list (Labor Day data, Shopify guidance, Moscow event trajectory) with citations placed immediately after each data point.\n\nIn short, anchor every claim in a source ID, tighten the causal chain into a testable near‑term thesis with explicit thresholds, and keep the risk overlay tightly tied to the Moscow event. The core numbers you should lock in are: Pottery Barn/6U8VYS7BA price cut and promo cadence (1–2 data points); Shopify GMV and revenue in H1 2025 and forward multiples (19NO2GMNF, QGXA2WQJ3); and the Moscow incident’s potential risk‑off spillover (NBX9RA9WX).",
