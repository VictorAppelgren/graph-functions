  "title": "Thinking About Buying Secondhand Vintage Cast Iron? Read This First.",
  "description": "Navigating the secondhand cast iron market can be challenging. But to score a quality vintage piece, knowing what to look out for makes all the difference.",
  "content": "A vintage piece is generally between 20 and 100 years old. But when it comes to cast iron, age doesn\u2019t always equate to value or quality. More often than not, you\u2019re better off asking yourself: Who made this piece? Wagner and Griswold were among the most notable cast iron manufacturers of yore, and they were both known for their craftsmanship. \u201cSince the popularity of cast iron has spiked in recent years, the demand for antique skillets made anywhere from the late 1800s to mid-20th century by now-defunct companies like Wagner and Griswold has skyrocketed,\u201d Michael Sullivan writes in our guide to cast-iron skillets. He\u2019s also a collector of vintage cast iron pieces. The two companies underwent a series of acquisitions and rebranding, which you can read more about here . This, in turn, led to many variations in the design, measurements, and markings of the cast iron pieces that were produced. According to Michael, the best way to navigate these changes and to spot authentic vintage pieces is to rely on these two resources: The Book of Wagner & Griswold and The Book of Griswold & Wagner. These two books \u2014 which are aptly referred to as the \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d books by cast iron aficionados\u2014 are exhaustive, encyclopedic guides of the products produced by these popular cast iron manufacturers. In the books, you\u2019ll find photographs and detailed descriptions of Griswold and Wagner cast iron pieces, including information about their design, dimensions, material, markings, production era, and even estimated market value. When sourcing vintage cast iron, Michael relies on the books to verify a piece\u2019s origin and to help determine its worth. You can also check websites, including The Cast Iron Collector, for additional information on vintage cookware. Michael\u2019s vintage Griswold pieces, including a classic cornstick pan for making cornbread in the shape of ears of corn.\n\nWhenever possible, buy from a verifiable source You can find vintage cast iron at estate sales, at online retailers like eBay or Facebook Marketplace, in thrift stores, and at yard sales. However, if you want to score some of the best prices, cast iron expert Chris Wing recommends sourcing vintage cast iron at flea markets. \u201cI like to see cast iron mixed with other random \u2018junk\u2019 on a table,\u201d he said. \u201cThis tells me that the seller is probably not a collector, and I may find a gem for cheap,\u201d explained Wing, who is known as Cast Iron Chris on social media and hosts a YouTube series called Basics of Cast Iron. Wing has also had success on Facebook Marketplace, but he said it has some drawbacks. \u201cI\u2019ve found great single pieces, and have even scored a batch of cast iron containing 60-plus pieces,\u201d he said. Wing said the downside to Facebook Marketplace is that you have to act fast because \u201cgood deals go quickly.\u201d When you\u2019re purchasing cast iron online, be wary of potential scammers. If the seller doesn\u2019t provide quality photos, you may want to request additional ones. Always verify the seller, and seek established vendors whenever possible. If you\u2019re shopping in person, don\u2019t hesitate to bring your red and blue books with you, Michael said.\n\nInspect the piece for signs of wear and damage Once you\u2019ve identified a cast iron piece of interest, inspect it closely. This is where a flashlight, a ruler, collector\u2019s reference books, and a rust eraser come in handy. Wing suggests first looking for signs of cracks or warping. \u201cCracks are most common on the walls of the pan,\u201d he said. Run your fingertips along the surface, or use a flashlight to detect any fractures or hairline cracks. Unfortunately, cracked pans can\u2019t be restored, and they aren\u2019t safe to cook with. Cracks can worsen with time, and fragments can wind up in your food. A cracked pan can also become a safety or fire hazard if spills seep through the cracks and land on a hot cooking surface. If the piece is intended solely for display, however, its condition is less important. Warping can be a sign of heat damage, caused by factors such as thermal shock, which can impact the cast iron pan\u2019s durability. It may also be difficult to use a warped skillet over a flat, electric stovetop, but you may be able to use it on a gas stove or grill. To detect warping in a pan, Wing recommends setting the piece down on a smooth surface, like a glass tabletop, and seeing if it wobbles or spins when you give the handle a light push. If it does, then the skillet is warped. If a flat surface isn\u2019t readily available, Wing suggests using a straight edge, like a ruler, to check whether the edge sits flat on the bottom of a pan. While rust isn\u2019t always an indication of damage, Michael said you\u2019ll want to look for signs of pitting \u2014 irregular indentations on the surface caused by rust or corrosion, defects, or chemicals used during previous restorations. Pitting is irreversible, and it can make seasoning a pan more difficult and cause uneven heating and cooking. And if a cast iron pan is rusty, it can be difficult to accurately assess its markings, including logos or numbers that can help determine its value. A rust eraser can help you carefully remove rust particles, and a flashlight can reveal any engravings so you can better identify a piece. Michael uses the Lodge Rust Eraser to remove a large area of rust from a cast iron skillet.\n\nAssess it with a healthy dose of skepticism Not every cast iron piece you encounter in a secondhand market will be worth the investment. You\u2019ll want to carefully consider each item to see whether it\u2019s right for you. Sellers may overprice an item or misidentify it. \u201cIt's up to the person who's hunting for it to really do their research,\u201d Michael said. \u201cCan a seller really know what they\u2019re selling if a cast iron skillet is fully crusted over?\u201d It\u2019s unlikely. When you\u2019re shopping vintage, the markings on a piece, like the italic lettering of a Griswold logo, or \u201cslants,\u201d present some of the most important clues for determining a skillet\u2019s worth. If you or the seller cannot identify a piece, there may be some room for negotiating the price. Meanwhile, scarcity of an item can also increase its demand and, subsequently, its value. Michael said that even if he can\u2019t ID a piece, every now and then he\u2019ll take a gamble \u2014 depending on a pan\u2019s condition, and if the price is right. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a pan that was totally crusted over, and I didn\u2019t know what it was, but it was $10. But after I stripped it, refinished it, and re-seasoned it, I discovered it was a Griswold.\u201d Still, whenever possible, you should try to rely on trusted resources, like the red and blue books, to double-check whether an item is accurately identified or possibly overpriced. Scoping out other sellers to get an idea of the market can help ensure you\u2019re getting the best and fairest deal.",

      "text": "The Best Cast-Iron Skillet\nA cast-iron skillet is great for everything from searing a T-bone or roasting a chicken to baking cornbread. And unlike Teflon-coated nonstick pans, a good one will become more nonstick with use, not less. We\u2019ve tested 16 skillets since 2017, and we think the Lodge Chef Collection 12 Inch Cast Iron Skillet is the best. It's lighter than other cast-iron skillets, better at searing, comes with a good factory seasoning, and has easy-to-grip handles.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a lighter nonstick alternative, you may want to consider a carbon steel pan. It\u2019s still not quite as light as a nonstick-coated aluminum pan, but like cast iron, it will only become more nonstick with use, and can last you a lifetime.\nWhy we love Lodge skillets\n- No-mess pouring\nThe pour spouts on our picks allowed us to channel hot oil out of the skillets with little to no spillage.\n- Comfortable-to-hold handles\nOur picks\u2019 handles and helper handles stayed firmly in our grip, even when we used a kitchen towel for insulation.\n- Great price\nWe found that our picks, both under $100 and made in the US, matched or outperformed the higher-end skillets we tested.\n- Solid seasoning\nBoth of our picks come with adequate factory seasoning, and both built up great nonstick seasoning in long-term testing.\nThe Lodge Chef Collection 12 Inch Cast Iron Skillet delivered evenly browned steaks, crisp golden cornbread, and sunny-side-up eggs that slipped right out of the pan.\nAt 6\u00bd pounds versus the 8\u00bd pounds of the classic Lodge, it\u2019s more manageable to maneuver than traditional cast iron, and the slightly lower, gently sloped sides make stirring foods and maneuvering a spatula easier.\nJust note that since it\u2019s shallower than the classic Lodge, this skillet is not as good for deep-frying\u2014if that\u2019s something you do often, go for the original design instead. Although it\u2019s priced a little higher than the classic Lodge, the Chef Collection skillet is still affordable and is also made in the USA.\nIf you want to deep-fry and don\u2019t mind doing a little heavy lifting, we think the Lodge Pre-Seasoned 12-inch Cast Iron Skillet is an excellent choice. It seared steak, fried eggs, and released cornbread well in our tests.\nAnd though it weighs about 2 pounds more than the brand\u2019s Chef Collection skillet and has a shorter (though still comfortable) handle, it\u2019s about a quarter inch deeper, which makes it better for frying chicken or preparing shallow braises. It\u2019s also a little less expensive than the Chef Collection skillet.\nWhy you should trust us\nSenior staff writer Lesley Stockton, who wrote the original version of this guide, had been writing about cookware for Wirecutter since 2013, covering skillets (both tri-ply and nonstick), roasting pans, saucepans, and electric pressure cookers. Before that, she cooked in fine-dining kitchens for many years and was a food editor in the Martha Stewart test kitchens for six years.\nSharon Franke, who worked on our 2019 update, tested and wrote about kitchen equipment at the Good Housekeeping Institute for more than 30 years. Before that she spent seven years rustling pots and pans as a professional chef in restaurants in New York City.\nSenior staff writer Michael Sullivan tested the Lodge Blacklock Triple Seasoned Cast-Iron Skillet against the reigning picks for our 2020 update. Before joining Wirecutter in 2016, he worked in the food and restaurant industry for several years, and he was an editor at the International Culinary Center (now the Institute of Culinary Education) in New York City for three years.\nFor this guide:\n- We interviewed Nancy Fuller, host of Farmhouse Rules; Jeremiah Langhorne, chef and owner of The Dabney in Washington, DC; Mary Theisen, a collector of vintage cast-iron, professor of chemistry at American University and author of Chemistry in Your Kitchen; and Brad Schwarting, former president of the Griswold and Cast Iron Cookware Association.\n- We also read editorial reviews by America's Test Kitchen (subscription required) and Serious Eats. Sam Sifton, founding food editor of New York Times Cooking, also helped with our 2017 testing.\n- Like all Wirecutter journalists, I review and test products with complete editorial independence. I\u2019m never made aware of any business implications of my editorial recommendations. Read more about our editorial standards.\nWho this is for\nCast-iron skillets have been an essential tool in American home kitchens for well over a century. Cooks turn to these durable pans for pan-frying, searing, baking, and making eggs.\nWhen used and cared for properly, cast iron can be an effective alternative to nonstick cookware, due to the seasoning (a slick coating of polymerized fat) that develops with use. And unlike nonstick-coated pans, cast iron is safe past 500 degrees and can go under the broiler.\nWhile nonstick skillets have a short life expectancy\u2014three to five years depending on use\u2014well-maintained cast-iron cookware can last generations. And while cast iron does require some special attention (and can\u2019t go in the dishwasher), it\u2019s not that much more difficult to care for than any other cookware.\nCast iron is ideal for searing because it holds onto heat better than stainless steel or aluminum cookware. Matthew Hartings, professor of chemistry at American University and author of Chemistry in Your Kitchen, told us, \u201cCast iron is heavy and dense, and that is the biggest thing it has going for it. It takes a while for the cast iron to really be preheated to where you can use it. But once it\u2019s there, it\u2019s great for searing and high-temperature cooking.\u201d All that stored heat translates to a thick sear on steaks and roasts, crispy fish skin, and deep caramelization on vegetables.\nWith careful tending, cast iron can also be used for lower-temp techniques like omelets and fried eggs. But one thing cast iron is not good at is distributing heat evenly the way cookware made of aluminum or tri-ply stainless steel can, so you\u2019ll need to watch those eggs carefully. And if you\u2019re cooking something like pancakes, you might have to move them around to get even browning.\nHow we picked\nWith a few exceptions, we found in our testing that most cast-iron skillets perform similarly at basic tasks like searing a steak or frying eggs. But a number of factors can affect how easy and comfortable a pan is to use and ultimately set some apart from the rest. Here\u2019s what we looked for in a good cast-iron pan:\nFactory-seasoned: Most cast-iron skillets will come preseasoned\u2014that is, coated with one or more layers of polymerized oil that provide a nonstick, rustproof finish. Whereas unseasoned cast iron is silver-gray, a seasoned pan will generally be black or brown all over.\nYou\u2019ll know a pan is well-seasoned if it\u2019s an even color all over, without darker specks or blotches. A good seasoning will work almost as well as a nonstick coating to consistently prevent foods like eggs and cornbread from sticking.\nEasy to maneuver: Most cast-iron pans are quite heavy\u2014the classic Lodge 12-inch skillet weighs about 8\u00bd pounds\u2014so it\u2019s important that they come with a comfortable handle and a large helper handle on the opposite edge of the pan.\nHaving both handles offers security when you\u2019re taking the pan off the stovetop and draining hot grease. We prefer slightly rounded stick handles that allow for a natural grip near their base, which gives you good control.\nBoth handles also get very hot, so the ability to get a good grip on them even with a bulky mitt is important.\nLarge pour spout: We like pans with functional pour spouts or lips that don\u2019t dribble bacon drippings and make a mess. When you take into account the heft and heat of a cast-iron skillet, aiming for the small opening of a jar is challenging on its own without the added headache of subpar pour spouts.\nInexpensive: We have tested pans ranging from $20 to $300 over the years and ultimately found that they don\u2019t perform that differently. The main things that set them apart are weight and texture.\nMost contemporary, inexpensive cast-iron cookware is heavy and comes with a slightly pebbly texture. A new generation of high-end cast-iron skillets produced by companies like Yeti or Stargazer come with a very smooth cooking surface and are typically a couple of pounds lighter.\nBut we found the smoother pans to be no more nonstick than the rougher ones, which will also smooth out with use as they develop layers of seasoning. Especially since Lodge now makes a lighter pan for around $40, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth paying well over $100 for these new-breed pans.\nWe also noticed that the expensive pans developed blotchy stains after searing steaks\u2014it didn\u2019t necessarily affect the performance, but this indicated that it will take more work to build up a dark, even seasoning on them.\nIf you\u2019re curious as to how heirloom skillets compare with new ones, we talk about vintage pans (as well as the high-end skillets that aim to reproduce them) below, and why you might want one.\nHow we tested\nTo test the cast-iron pans, we started by heating a quarter cup of oil in each skillet until shimmering, then poured the hot fat into a jar to see if we could do this with minimal (or no) dribbling on the countertop. We also paid attention to the comfort and maneuverability of the handle when lifting and tilting each pan.\nNext, we greased and floured each skillet\u2019s interior surface and heated it to see how evenly it browned, an indication of how well it conducts heat across the entire surface. Not surprisingly, as cast iron is not an even conductor of heat, none of the skillets browned perfectly evenly, although two of the high-end pans did better than most.\nNext, we cooked 6 ounces of bacon in each skillet until crisp. To check for the nonstick-ness of the factory seasoning, we made cornbread and turned the pans upside down to see if the baked bread fell out without prying or sticking. All but one of our skillets had a clean release.\nWe then seared boneless sirloin strip steaks in 2 teaspoons of canola oil to gauge how well each pan seared meat. Finally, we fried two eggs in a tablespoon of butter to test how well the seasoning held up and to see how easily a spatula could be maneuvered around the skillets\u2019 sides.\nOur pick: Lodge Chef Collection 12-Inch Cast Iron Skillet\nThe Lodge Chef Collection 12 Inch Cast Iron Skillet did well in all our tests, and impressively it was the lightest of all the inexpensive skillets we tested (though some $80 to $100-plus pans weighed a bit less).\nWhat really made the Lodge skillet stand out from the competition is its lighter weight combined with its affordable price. At 6\u00bd pounds, it weighs a full 2 pounds less than the traditional 12-inch Lodge skillet and is more comparable in heft to some of the $200 or $300 pans we tested.\nIf you\u2019re willing to pay more for a slightly lighter pan, Lodge also makes the Blacklock Triple Seasoned Cast-Iron Skillet, but we think the Lodge Chef Collection performed better overall.\nWhile the Chef Collection pan is a little shallower than the classic Lodge, this skillet\u2019s slightly sloped sides make it great for searing and roasting. It has a comfortable handle, a good factory seasoning, and like other Lodge skillets, it\u2019s still made in the USA.\nThe Lodge was a solid performer at just about every task. We poured hot oil without dribbles and cooked bacon to a crisp without having to rearrange the strips. Cornbread fell out of the pan with a crunchy golden crust and steak came out evenly and deeply browned. Fried eggs slid out as effortlessly as from a nonstick skillet.\nThe sides are shaped better for searing. The sides of the Lodge Chef Collection skillet are also about a quarter inch lower than the classic Lodge\u2019s, which will decrease steaming when you\u2019re browning burgers, helping you achieve a great sear.\nAnother thing that differentiates this skillet is that the sides of the pan are rounded, so it\u2019s easier to maneuver a spatula for flipping pancakes or for stirring vegetables. The gentle curve doesn\u2019t decrease the cooking surface (which is a generous 10 inches across and big enough to easily fit a large rib eye steak, 6 ounces of bacon, or four large fried eggs) and actually makes it a little more forgiving if you\u2019re trying to squeeze in one more egg.\nIt's easy to hold and maneuver. The small stick handle is placed at a slight angle and is smoother at the spot where it meets the pan, making it more ergonomic than the short, straight handle on the original Lodge.\nThe roomy helper handle on the other side of the skillet is big enough to wrap your fingers underneath with a bulky pot holder. When we were pouring hot oil, our grip on the handle was secure, and we always kept control of the pan.\nLike other Lodge pans, the Chef Collection skillet is widely available and very affordable, if slightly higher priced than the brand\u2019s classic models. Lodge skillets are available on multiple websites (including Amazon) as well as through national retail chains, independently owned hardware stores, and cooking stores.\nHow the Lodge Chef Collection Skillet has held up\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIt might be too short and light for some tasks. The Chef Collection skillet is shallower than the classic Lodge and holds about 2 cups less. Its capacity could be problematic if you\u2019re braising something like pork chops with vegetables and will make it more difficult to fry chicken without risk of dangerous oil overflow.\nWhile you can always braise or deep-fry in a Dutch oven instead, if you\u2019d like to be able to do these things in your skillet, we recommend the original Lodge 12-inch skillet instead.\nThe lighter weight of the Chef Collection skillet could also be a slight drawback if you were browning a very thick piece of meat like a tomahawk steak, as a heavier pan will hold in more heat and give you better second-side browning. However, we didn\u2019t notice a difference between the Chef Collection and the heavier traditional Lodge when we seared half-inch-thick strip steaks.\nLodge doesn\u2019t have a formal written guarantee or warranty on its classic cast-iron ware. That said, many of us have Lodge skillets at home that range in age from 15 to 20 years old and have never had a problem. The lack of a warranty doesn\u2019t concern us because Lodge cast-iron skillets are very durable, and Lodge has a good reputation for customer service.\nAlso great: Lodge Pre-Seasoned 12-inch Cast Iron Skillet\nIf you prefer a pan with higher sides for frying or braising, the Lodge Pre-Seasoned 12-inch Cast Iron Skillet is an excellent option.\nLike the Lodge Chef Collection skillet, it comes well-seasoned and performed as well as skillets many times its price in our tests. It\u2019s notably heavier than the Chef Collection skillet but still comfortable to maneuver with the aid of the generous helper handle.\nAt around 8\u00bd pounds, this classic Lodge skillet weighs about 2 pounds more than the Lodge Chef Collection pan. That extra weight could be a real asset when it comes to cooking a thick cut of meat, since it can help the pan retain more heat.\nBut overall it performed the same as the Chef Collection skillet in our tests, searing steak well and releasing eggs easily. Flipping this pan over takes some muscle, but when we did it, our cornbread plopped right out.\nThe high sides also make the classic Lodge ideal for deep-frying, braising, or baking a cobbler, since it can hold about 2 cups more than the Chef Collection skillet. If those are things you do often, this is the pan to get.\nThe Lodge\u2019s stick handle is smaller than the one on the Chef Collection skillet and lacks an angle, but you can still get a good grip. Using it with the large helper handle, you\u2019ll maintain solid control of this heavy pan, even when you\u2019re taking it hot out of the oven or pouring grease into a jar. In comparison, we found that the longer, bulkier handles on some pans made them more unwieldy.\nThe classic Lodge costs a very reasonable $20 to $30 (buying the skillet on Amazon costs a little more, because it comes with a silicone handle grip), making it slightly less expensive than the Chef Collection skillet.\nAgain, Lodge doesn\u2019t have a formal written guarantee or warranty, but we\u2019ve used Lodge skillets for many years without experiencing any problems, and Lodge\u2019s products have long been popular with chefs and cooking personalities.\nHow the Lodge Classic Skillet has held up\nCare and maintenance\nThe easiest way to maintain your cast-iron pan is with regular use. A clever trick is to keep it on your stove, or easily at hand, so it\u2019s convenient to use (it also doesn\u2019t hurt to cook bacon and other fatty foods in it from time to time).\nContrary to popular belief, you can wash your pan with mild dish soap and hot water. To loosen stubborn cooked-on food, pour hot tap water in the skillet while it\u2019s still hot and let it bubble for a minute or two, then transfer to the sink and hand wash.\nMake sure to dry your pan completely since lingering moisture can cause rust spots or damage your seasoning. You can do this over low heat on the stove or in the oven. When it\u2019s dry, rub a very thin layer of a neutral oil all over the inside and outside of the pan to preserve its seasoning.\nMost of the time, that\u2019s all you\u2019ll need to keep your pan in great shape. But if you find yourself with burned-on food deposits, a pocked patina, or a rust invasion, read our comprehensive guide to cleaning and seasoning cast-iron cookware, which covers almost every situation you could run into.\nWhat about antique and artisan skillets?\nSince the popularity of cast iron has spiked in recent years, the demand for antique skillets made anywhere from the late 1800s to mid-20th century by now-defunct companies like Wagner and Griswold has skyrocketed.\nNow that more people are seeking out these pans, the prices have quadrupled in some cases. Meanwhile, a new generation of lighter, smoother, pricier cast-iron skillets from artisanal companies has emerged out of a desire to manufacture new pans that are similar to the older ones.\nAntique and vintage cast-iron cookware were hand-poured into sand molds and hand-polished to a smooth finish. These labor-intensive pans were cast from thinner molds, which makes them lighter than many modern pans and easier to maneuver.\nThe hand polishing also makes for a slicker cooking surface. The makers of the new artisanal pans replicate this process, while in contrast most inexpensive modern cast-iron pans are mass-produced on automated production lines. They retain the rough texture of the sand mold and weigh significantly more.\nFor our original review, we bought two Wagner #10 skillets\u2014which are slightly smaller than the 12-inch modern skillets we tested\u2014from eBay and tested them against our modern pans after seasoning them with Sheryl Canter\u2019s technique. In 2019, we also tested a number of high-end new skillets modeled after antiques.\nOverall, none of them performed much better than the inexpensive Lodge skillets. One of the antique pans arrived much slicker than the other, and it released fried eggs a little easier.\nBut it also illustrated one disadvantage of a super-smooth surface: It allowed steak to dome in the middle when the muscle shrunk. A Lodge skillet gave us a more consistent sear and released cornbread better than the antiques.\nLodge pans also performed the same as the new high-end skillets we tested and in some cases better. One of the expensive skillets we tested had trouble releasing cornbread, and all of them seemed to have less seasoning than more traditional dark-black skillets.\nAfter some cooking tests, the surface of all the high-end skillets looked blotchy, and some had patches of the base metal showing through. The manufacturers of these skillets suggest they don\u2019t need as much seasoning, since the very smooth surface will provide excellent release.\nThey will build up more seasoning over time, but the Lodge pans have a great, nicely nonstick seasoning right out of the box.\nFor most cooking tasks, we found the heft of a skillet doesn\u2019t have any bearing. Lighter antique or high-end skillets are easier to lift and maneuver, but a helper handle makes even hefty skillets manageable. And for searing a thick cut of meat like a sirloin roast, a heavier skillet has the advantage: It will hold in more heat and give you better second-side browning.\nThe competition\nThe Lodge Blacklock Triple Seasoned Cast-Iron Skillet is advertised as being 5 pounds 6 ounces, according to the specs listed on Lodge\u2019s website, but it actually weighs about 6 pounds 2\u215c ounces by our measure. Since it\u2019s only about 6 ounces lighter than the Chef\u2019s Collection pan we recommend, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth paying significantly more. In our tests, the Blacklock dripped more oil when pouring it into a jar, while the Lodge Classic and Chef\u2019s Collection pans poured in relatively steady streams. Cornbread also stuck badly to the bottom of the Blacklock unlike the other two pans. While we like the slightly longer handle on the Blacklock and its deeper sides for frying chicken, ultimately we don\u2019t think these benefits outweigh its drawbacks.\nThe Victoria 12-inch cast-iron skillet was our previous runner-up, and in tests for this update performed on a par with the Lodge skillets. Its slightly sloped sides are good for whisking pan sauces and make the capacity a little more forgiving, so you can squeeze in an extra strip of bacon. Victoria\u2019s large spouts allowed us to pour off hot oil without a single drip. On the downside, the longer stick handle throws off the weight distribution and makes the pan seem heavier, even though the Victoria weighs a pound less than the Lodge. Victoria cast-iron cookware comes with a lifetime warranty.\nAmazonBasics Pre-Seasoned Cast Iron Skillet - 12-Inch has a very rough texture, so although theoretically it should take a while to develop a nonstick patina, it performed just as well as every other pan we tested. It\u2019s deep, which would work well for frying chicken. However, at about 8 pounds, it\u2019s one of the heaviest skillets we tested, and it heated very unevenly so it isn\u2019t one of our picks. You only get a one-year warranty from Amazon.\nThe Camp Chef 12\" Seasoned Cast Iron Skillet released foods cleanly in our tests, but it is particularly rough-textured, heated extremely unevenly, and has a slightly smaller interior surface than the others we tested. The warranty is also only 90 days.\nAt under 6 pounds, the Field Company #10 Field Cast Iron Skillet weighs the least of all those we tested. It has a smoothly polished surface that heated up very evenly. There are no pour spouts, but we found it easy to pour hot grease over the edge without dripping. Like the Butter Pat, this pan is shallow and showed blotchy stains after searing a steak. Though we enjoyed using it, we find it hard to justify the $160 price.\nAt around $120, the Stargazer Cast Iron 12-inch Skillet was the least expensive of the new-gen pans we tested and was the least smooth. Although the large handle\u2019s not particularly comfortable to hold, it stays cool enough to touch when you\u2019re cooking on the stovetop. As the Stargazer is quite deep, it would be a good choice for frying chicken or poaching dumplings. It has a rolled lip instead of pour spouts, and we had no problem pouring off bacon grease without getting it all over the counter. But again, the Lodge pans performed just as well, didn\u2019t stain when searing, and have more comfortable handles.\nNot only was the Smithey Ironware No. 12 Cast Iron Skillet slow to heat up, it was particularly uneven at heating. After we cooked bacon, it looked like some of the manufacturer\u2019s finish had been stripped off, which may account for the fact that this was only one of two skillets we tested that couldn\u2019t turn out cornbread without sticking.\nThe overdesigned Finex 12-inch octagonal skillet is another offering from the indie movement of cast-iron producers trying to make pans the old way. Finex skillets have a polished cooking area, but the walls are left with the casting texture. While the spiraled polished stainless steel handle is designed to stay cool, it didn\u2019t in our tests. The handle is too thick to grasp securely with a folded towel, and it slipped when we poured drippings. The helper handle is small and doesn\u2019t offer much for support. The eight corners of the skillet are touted to offer versatility when pouring, but every corner dribbled on our counter.\nThe Utopia Kitchen skillet is an obvious Lodge knockoff, except that the seasoning on the Utopia is ineffective against sticking, and the pour spouts dribbled a lot of oil on our countertops.\nSources\nNancy Fuller, host of Farmhouse Rules, phone interview, December 6, 2016\nJeremiah Langhorne, chef and owner of The Dabney, phone interview, December 8, 2016\nMary Theisen, vintage cast iron collector, phone interview, December 6, 2016\nMatthew Hartings, author of Chemistry in Your Kitchen, phone interview, December 22, 2016\nBrad Schwarting, president of Griswold and Cast Iron Cookware Association, phone interview, December 7, 2016\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Lodge Cookware Can Last a Lifetime, and It Costs Less Than $100\nFew kitchen items inspire love and devotion like cast-iron cookware. Pans are carefully passed down through generations as family heirlooms, and vintage pieces\u2014rescued from yard sales or swap meets and restored to their original glory\u2014sell for thousands of dollars on Etsy and similar sites.\nBut thankfully, you don\u2019t need to spend anywhere near that much for similar quality. Lodge cast-iron cookware is affordable, high quality, and made to last. It reliably stands out from the competition for its durability and especially for its value.\nYes, Le Creuset cookware is pretty. Yes, Finex has that modernist thing going for it. But Lodge can provide you with a well-crafted Dutch oven or skillet for a fraction of the cost of those brands\u2019 pieces. And with proper care, Lodge cookware could last a lifetime. You can\u2019t say that of many under-$100 items.\nThe workhorse of the kitchen: Lodge 12-Inch Cast Iron Skillet\nWhen most people think of Lodge cookware, the classic skillet is what comes to mind. That\u2019s for good reason: These skillets look good, cook beautifully, and last forever. You can make anything from bacon and eggs to pizza and stir-fry dishes.\nIn our review of the best cast-iron skillets, we put 16 cast-iron skillets through six tests, including frying bacon, baking cornbread, and searing steaks. Our pick, the Lodge Chef Collection 12-Inch Cast Iron Skillet, excelled at every task.\nAt 6.5 pounds, it is the lightest of all the inexpensive skillets we tested. It sports a comfortable handle, too. For something that you may be trying to grab out of a 400 \u00b0F oven, that\u2019s important.\nIn our tests of the Lodge skillet\u2019s nonstickiness, cornbread fell out of the pan with a golden crust, and fried eggs slid out effortlessly. The cooking surface, measuring 10 inches across, is large enough to fit a ribeye steak, 6 ounces of bacon, or four large fried eggs.\nThe also-great Lodge Pre-Seasoned 12-Inch Cast Iron Skillet (the model I personally use) is deeper and therefore much better for frying, though it weighs a hefty 8.5 pounds.\nThe most versatile vessel: Lodge 6 Quart Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven\nThis was my first piece of Lodge cookware\u2014the green version, purchased back in 2011\u2014and I still use it on a weekly basis. More than 10 years is a long time in kitchen terms, and this piece certainly has its battle scars: chips from the occasional drop, some scratches from careless cleaning, and stains from cooked-on oil. But it\u2019s still my go-to for making chili, stew, and biryani.\nWith shorter sides and a wider base than on other Dutch ovens, this top pick from our guide to the best Dutch ovens imparts a better sear on meats and helps concentrate flavors during the cooking process. It\u2019s easy to use, move, and grip, thanks to its large handles.\nI\u2019ve made this fantastic Ghanian chicken and peanut stew in it dozens of times. The interior\u2019s curved corners prevent food from getting stuck along the base, which is especially helpful when I need to deglaze the pan. The enamel finish is easy to clean and surprisingly resilient, and the cast iron holds and distributes heat exceptionally well. For a long time, this piece was my default bread-baking vessel, too.\nUntil, that is, I met the Lodge Cast Iron Combo Cooker.\nA blistering bread baker: Lodge 3.2 Quart Cast Iron Combo Cooker\nIf you bake bread regularly, you owe it to yourself to grab this two-in-one marvel. Made from seasoned black cast iron, the Lodge 3.2 Quart Cast Iron Combo Cooker is essentially a skillet and a Dutch oven in one.\nSince buying mine in July 2020, I\u2019ve baked dozens of times in it, bringing my tally up to well over 100 boules. (Yes, I give a lot of bread away. I\u2019m not a monster.)\nThe biggest upside to this cooker over my enameled Dutch oven is that I can also use it inverted, with the shallow \u201clid\u201d (the skillet half of the combo) as the base. The low sides of the skillet make it way easier for me to load the dough and remove the loaf when the baking is done, but I still get the steam-trapping capabilities of a regular Dutch oven. This ensures that I get the beautifully burnished, blistered crust that all sourdough bakers strive for.\nWhen I tested the Lodge cooker against the high-end Challenger Bread Pan, I found that the cooker was a little tougher to maneuver and less flexible in what bread shapes it could accommodate, but it produced bread every bit as good for a sixth of the price. That kind of value is pretty hard to beat.\nNote that while this piece is technically also a Dutch oven, it\u2019s not as easy to use for Dutch oven tasks as Lodge\u2019s enameled alternative. For one thing, the enameled Dutch oven\u2019s finish is easier to care for (assuming you can avoid scratching it), and its white interior allows you to more easily see when aromatics\u2014say, onions for a stew\u2014are browning. The lid of the enameled Dutch oven, with its central, knob-like handle, is also much easier to maneuver than the Combo Cooker\u2019s skillet side and its long, stick-like handle.\nMake your cast iron last\nWe have advice on how to clean and season cast-iron cookware. But if you\u2019re looking for the TL;DR version, read on.\nIf you have an enameled Lodge Dutch oven (or another enameled cast-iron piece), never use metal kitchen implements in it\u2014instead, stick to wood and silicone. Wash it by hand, using a soft sponge and gentle detergent, and avoid anything containing citrus. For stuff that\u2019s seriously stuck to the enamel, boil some water in the Dutch oven and then use a wooden spoon to scrape it off.\nBlack cast iron from Lodge comes preseasoned, but you can add more layers of seasoning to create a truly nonstick finish more quickly. Place the pan in the oven and preheat it to about 500 \u00b0F. Then carefully remove the pan from the oven, add a small amount of vegetable oil or other neutral oil, and wipe it across all of the pan\u2019s surfaces with a paper towel. Spread the oil very thin, until it looks almost dry. Then return the pan to the oven, inverted, and bake it at 500 \u00b0F for another hour. Repeat as many times as you like.\nTo clean a black cast-iron pan after cooking, you can use a soft sponge, hot water, and mild dish soap. If you encounter hard, stuck-on bits of food, use large-grain salt, water, and a sponge or a soft-bristle brush to scrub it off. If that fails, use the boiling-water trick above. After your pan is clean, dry it thoroughly to prevent rust, add a very small amount of neutral oil, and spread the oil in a thin layer over the entire surface.\nA version of this article was originally published as part of our 2020 \u201c52 Things We Love\u201d series, an ode to Wirecutter picks that have stood the test of time.

      "text": "Cast Iron Isn\u2019t Indestructible. Here\u2019s How to Protect It While Grilling.\nWhen a cast-iron skillet is properly taken care of, it can last a lifetime. But cast-iron cookware isn\u2019t invincible.\nDespite seeming like an indestructible kitchen workhorse, a cast-iron pan can be highly susceptible to fluctuating temperatures, such as when you put a cold skillet on a hot grill. So preventing thermal shock (a drastic temperature change that can wreak havoc on even the sturdiest cast-iron cookware) is crucial.\nSince grilling season is just around the corner, we tapped several experts for their advice on how to avoid temperature-inflicted damage on a precious cast-iron skillet.\nWhat is thermal shock?\nThermal shock is when a material is damaged due to a sudden temperature change.\nWhen cast iron heats up, the metal expands, and when it cools down, it contracts, according to cast-iron expert Chris Wing. Known as Cast Iron Chris on social media, Wing is also the host of a YouTube series called Basics of Cast Iron.\n\u201cIf this process happens too rapidly, it creates uneven heating and cooling, and since cast iron isn\u2019t as flexible or malleable as other metals, the uneven expansion and contraction can create internal stress on the material,\u201d Wing explained. He said this reaction can cause the cast iron to warp, crack, or, in extreme cases, split in half.\nIf a cast-iron pan or skillet comes from a cold environment and is heated quickly \u2014 whether on an electric stove, an open fire, a grill, or in an oven \u2014 the risk of thermal shock increases. Senior staff writer Michael Sullivan, who co-wrote our cast-iron skillet guide, said you can also shock a hot cast-iron skillet by running it under cold water (or transferring it to another equally cold environment, like a refrigerator or freezer) without allowing it to cool first.\nEnameled cast iron (cast-iron cookware coated with a layer of enameled glass) is also at risk of thermal shock. Wing pointed out that vintage or antique cast-iron pieces (which are very thin and light) are more susceptible to damage than modern pieces (which tend to be thicker and more durable).\nWing assured us that the risk of thermal shock happening to cast-iron cookware while you\u2019re grilling is relatively low. But if cast-iron cookware is handled incorrectly, thermal shock can happen during other routine activities. For example, it can occur if you wash a cast-iron skillet without allowing it to cool first. Thermal shock can also happen if you place your pan in or on a piping-hot appliance \u2014 like an oven, a stovetop burner, or a grill \u2014 without gradually warming it up first.\nIn some cases, damage caused by thermal shock is highly noticeable. For example, a cold cast-iron pan might split in half when it\u2019s exposed to a piping-hot heat source. But sometimes the damage isn\u2019t as dramatic. \u201cSome older pans may experience \u2018microcracking,\u2019 small surface cracks that aren\u2019t as noticeable to the naked eye and make a pan more susceptible to breakage over time,\u201d Michael said.\nDrastic temperature changes can exacerbate these fissures, big or small, so it\u2019s important to avoid thermal shock whenever possible.\nHow to prevent thermal shock\nThe easiest and most effective way to prevent thermal shock is to gradually warm up (or cool down) cast-iron cookware.\nLodge, the manufacturer of our top-pick cast-iron skillet, recommends pre-heating cast-iron cookware for three to five minutes on medium-low heat before increasing the temperature to the desired setting.\nWhen you\u2019re grilling, Wing said you should place cast-iron cookware on the grill grates while they\u2019re still cold. Then turn on the burners, close the lid, and gradually warm up the cast-iron pan until it\u2019s evenly heated through.\nIf a cast-iron pan has been in the refrigerator or another equally cold environment, Wing recommended leaving it out at room temperature for at least 10 minutes before putting it on the grill, to avoid thermal shock. To ensure a cast-iron pan has sufficiently warmed up, Wing suggested using a probe thermometer with a built-in infrared sensor to check the temperature.\nCast iron is excellent at retaining heat. If a cast-iron pan overheats and starts smoking while you\u2019re cooking, Wing said it\u2019s best to remove the pan from the grill, using a heat-proof glove, and lower the burner intensity. Then let the pan and grill cool down before you continue to cook. After a few minutes, he suggested using the infrared thermometer to check that the grill and pan are back to the desired temperature, to avoid damaging the pan and overcooking your food.\nHigh temperatures can also cause damage\nAlthough high temperatures aren\u2019t exactly considered thermal shock, Wing said exposing cast-iron cookware to extreme heat (anything over 1,000 \u00baF) can also damage and cause warping or cracking.\nEven sustaining temperatures at around 650 \u00baF can cause a cast-iron pan\u2019s seasoning to start breaking down, according to information on Lodge\u2019s website. However, many gas grills, including Weber\u2019s, will max out between 500 \u00baF to 550 \u00baF. So exposing cast-iron cookware to extreme heat on those grills shouldn\u2019t be cause for concern.\nSome infrared grills, like the Charbroil Pro Series 3 Burner Gas Grill & Griddle, can reach much higher temperatures than most conventional gas grills. According to Charbroil\u2019s website, when you\u2019re cooking on a grill equipped with its Amplifire infrared technology, you should reduce the heat settings by about 30%, and cut the cooking time by about half, to prevent overcooking food.\nWhile testing the Charbroil Pro for our gas grill guide, staff writer Kathleen Squires found that it caused dangerous flare-ups and reached extreme temperatures, which can pose a risk to cast-iron cookware. So it should be used with caution. (These are just a few reasons why we don\u2019t recommend this grill in our guide.)\nLet your cast-iron skillet cool before you clean it\nCast iron can retain heat for longer than aluminum and stainless steel. So you\u2019ll want to give your cast-iron skillet ample time to cool down before cleaning it. \u201cAdding cold water to a hot pan is a terrible idea,\u201d Wing reiterated. However, if there\u2019s a lot of stuck-on food, to help dislodge it, Wing said he sometimes deglazes a pan, using liquid only, if the pan is under 400 \u00baF.\nWhen you\u2019re letting a cast-iron pan cool, Wing said it\u2019s fine to leave it on the grill with the burners off and the lid open. But he said you\u2019ll want to avoid leaving the pan on a grill overnight or in a humid or moist environment, since rust can build up quickly.\nFor a step-by-step tutorial on how to clean (and season) cast-iron cookware, check out our guide. Then you\u2019ll be ready to use your cast-iron cookware all summer long \u2014 and beyond.\nThis article was edited by Megan Beauchamp and Maxine Builder.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Evolution of the Griswold Trademark\nSelden & Griswold\nMatthew Griswold had been making cast iron hollow ware for the better part of two decades before first putting the Griswold name on a skillet. Having been in business with his cousins, the Selden brothers, since 1868, the name Griswold was originally seen in the mark \"Selden & Griswold\", on various pieces of hollowware. Griswold bought out his relatives' interest in 1884.\nSelden & Griswold trademark on a waffle iron.\nErie Diamond and Griswold's Erie\nThe name Griswold alone on a trademark would then first appear on a handful of pieces in the form of Griswold's first stylized logo, known as the \"Griswold's Erie Diamond\", and next when the sixth series \"ERIE\" skillets were changed to read \"GRISWOLD'S ERIE\", around 1906. This second trademark containing the Griswold name would be short lived, however, as traditional block lettering would begin to be replaced by stylized logos by many makers.\nGriswold's Erie Diamond logo.\nGriswold's Erie trademark.\nThe last surviving text-only trademark would continue to be seen on the Victor economy line of skillets, to which \"THE GRISWOLD MFG. CO.\" had been added mid-way through their period of manufacture.\nGriswold's Victor, fully marked.\nThe \"Slant\" Logo\nThe first \"Griswold\" trademark to be used across virtually all production, and perhaps the most iconic, is known as the \"slant logo\". As with later Griswold trademarks, it consisted of a cross inside a double circle, with the name GRISWOLD spanning the horizontal arms of the cross. \"Slant\" because of the stylized italic lettering used for the name. While \"trademark\" is the more properly applicable term, \"logo\" is often used and should not be regarded as incorrect.\nGriswold slant logo.\nThe slant logo was generally of the same diameter on most pieces, with exceptions made for pieces like lids, where a reduced size version was used.\nThere exist a few pieces with what is sometimes for lack of a better term called a medium slant logo. Slightly smaller and proportionally different from the normal slant, it may have been the result of a prototype pattern being used for actual production.\nGriswold medium slant logo.\nThe slant logo was seen on both heat ringed and in rare cases smooth bottom skillets, as well as on pans marked \"ERIE\" and \"ERIE, PA, U.S.A.\", being referred to by collectors as \"Slant Erie\" and \"Slant EPU\", respectively.\nOn the older, \"ERIE\" marked pieces, the slant trademark was typically not as heavily incised as on the later \"ERIE, PA, U.S.A.\" pans.\nThe slant logo's use would continue for some time into the large block logo era, with old patterns seen modified to add the other inscriptions characteristic of the large block pieces. It would be some 10 years before the slant logo disappeared from production altogether.\nThe \"Large Block\" Logo\nLater, around 1920, the slant logo was updated, with the lettering being changed to a block style. The overall weight of the logo would become more bold as well. This logo would come to be known as the \"large block logo\" or \"LBL\", the \"large\" referring to the lettering and differentiating it from a later revision with smaller lettering. The addition of descriptive markings such as \"CAST IRON SKILLET\" and the appending of \", PA, U.S.A.\" to the \"ERIE\" made the LBL markings more complex than on any other Griswold skillet, and perhaps the most attractive to collectors.\nGriswold Large Block logo with heat ring.\nGriswold Large Block logo with smooth bottom.\nSome minor variations in the large block logo are seen, most notably on the #4 and #5 smooth bottom skillets. On these, the lettering is proportionally not as tall as on most.\nGriswold #5 Large Block logo.\nThe large block logo also is seen on both heat ring and smooth bottom skillets, but only with the \"ERIE, PA, U.S.A.\" designation.\nThe \"Small Block\" Logo\nAbout 1939, the logo was reduced in size, likely the result of all but the largest skillet patterns being replaced outright, rather than just being modified, as was previously seen. This assumption is borne out by the lack of \"ghost\" markings being seen on most of these later pieces. Along with the logo shrinkage, the overall weight of the lettering, cross, and circles was reduced, and inscriptions like \"CAST IRON SKILLET\" were eliminated. The \"ERIE, PA, U.S.A.\" was also shortened to \"ERIE, PA.\". As such, it would appear the markings were made plain enough to simply be stamped into blank working patterns. This trademark would be known to collectors years later as the \"small block logo\", abbreviated \"SBL\".\nGriswold Small Block logo, early handle.\nSlant Logo Smooth Bottom Skillets\nAt some point, the slant logo made a brief appearance on a handful of smooth bottom skillet sizes. Exactly when and why is uncertain. Some date them the same as the similarly marked heat ring versions, while others place them much later, early in the small block era. Wagner had introduced their smooth bottom skllets ca. 1935, so there is a possibility these Griswold smooth bottoms were produced around that time as well.\nThe old catalogs don't seem to be of much help in clarifying this issue. Were both heat ring and smooth bottom versions offered simultaneously, or were the obsolete heat-ringed patterns perhaps dug out at some alter time and modified into smooth-bottomed simply to provide enough working patterns to keep up with demand? In either case, the scarcity of these pieces makes them highly collectible.\nGriswold Slant logo on smooth-bottomed skillet.\nGriswold Slant logo on smooth-bottomed skillet with ERIE ghost.\nMedium Block aka \"Late Large\" Logo\nBriefly, around 1955 according to dateable examples, it appears the logo was once again poised for revision. Only seen on a few different pieces, this logo was essentially a smaller version of the \"large block\", but still larger than the \"small block\". This logo is known to collectors as the \"medium block\", or sometimes the \"late large logo\".\nThe original large block logo had appeared in different sizes, dependent on the piece upon which it was inscribed. Although smaller than that on a #8 skillet, the logo on a size #0 toy skillet is still considered a large block logo. What differentiates the late large logo is the fact that it does not appear on pieces also marked \"ERIE, PA U.S.A.\", but only on those marked \"ERIE, PA\" in the smaller font seen with small block logo pieces.\nIt is theorized that this logo might have replaced the small block across the entire line had Griswold not been bought out by the company which also owned Wagner.\nGriswold Medium Block or Late Large logo.\nGriswold Medium Block or Late Large logo.\nGriswold Medium Block or Late Large logo.\nGriswold Medium Block or Late Large logo Square Skillet.\nRaised Logo\nAlthough normally incised, the trademark was in some instances seen as raised, these being confined mainly to the tops of some lids, implements like food choppers, and, as was normal for all but the earliest Griswold designs, their waffle irons. (Raised markings were typically not seen on surfaces subject to constant wear, and, if so, such practice was usually quickly abandoned.) When seen on an iron or aluminum lid, the trademark is referred to as the \"button logo\", and is in some cases seen with only a single circle.\nGriswold button logo, double circle.\nGriswold button logo, single circle.\nCross-in-Double-Circle Logo In Print\nA paradox exists between the logo as most commonly seen incribed on the cookware and that seen on Griswold printed publications such as catalogs, bulletins, and on letterhead. In print, the tips of the cross are closed by straight lines, whereas on the cast iron, it is the inside circle which forms the boundaries. Only on a few pieces, typically cast aluminum, does the logo have the additional line segments seen on the printed logo. Additionally, the print logo typically has the lettering in the early slant style.\nGriswold print logo.\nPost-Acquisition Variations\nThe Griswold trademark would undergo more changes after the acquisition by Wagner. It would appear the company which owned Wagner was more interested in only using the Griswold name and not so much its classic designs. Griswold-marked pieces after the buy-out appear to be from modified Wagner patterns, with hastily-concocted versions of the Griswold trademark applied. Use of the Griswold trademark in any form would be discontinued after 1973.\nGriswold logo applied to a Wagner pattern.\nGriswold logo applied to a Wagner pattern, with Made In USA.\nGriswold logo with no cross applied to a Wagner pattern.\nGriswold Wagner dual logo.\nDating The TMs\nUsing this table, the approximate time period of manufacture of a Griswold trademarked skillet can be determined.\n| Griswold TM | Selden & Griswold | Diamond Logo | Griswold's Erie | \"Slant\" Logo | Large Block | Small Block | Late Large | |\n| Time Period | 1870-1890 | 1884-1909 | 1905-1906 | 1906-1929 | 1939-1944 | 1920-1940 | 1939-1957 | 1955-1957 |\n| Heat Ring | N/A\u00b9 | N/A\u00b9 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes, No | No\u00b2 | No |\n| Heat Ring Type | N/A | N/A | Inset | Inset | None | Inset, None | Inset\u00b2 | N/A |\n\u00b9Trademark apparently not used on skillets.\n\u00b2Sizes 12 and above have (inset) heat rings."

      "text": "How to Clean and Season Cast-Iron Cookware\nIf I were banished to a desert island and allowed to bring only a single piece of cookware, I\u2019d choose a cast-iron skillet. It can work for just about anything\u2014baking cornbread or cakes, roasting vegetables, searing steaks, or frying chicken. It\u2019s versatile and affordable, and it boasts superior heat retention. What\u2019s not to love?\nOh, right, it requires maintenance\u2014you can\u2019t just throw it in the dishwasher and forget about it. But with proper care, your cast-iron cookware will last a lifetime (or more). I\u2019ve been cooking with cast iron for years, and I\u2019ve tested dozens of methods and products for cleaning it to find out what works best.\nHere\u2019s a primer on how to strip, season, clean, and store your cast-iron cookware so it will last for generations. Trust me, whoever inherits it will thank you.\nThe research\n- What you need\n- How long will it take to clean?\n- How to clean a cast-iron skillet after everyday cooking\n- How to remove rust from cast iron\n- How to re-season cast iron\n- How to completely strip a cast iron pan (and when to do it)\n- Cleaning a Dutch oven and other enameled cast iron\n- Our thoughts on products marketed specifically for cast iron\n- Sources\nWhat you need\nFor everyday cleaning and seasoning\n- Dish soap: In our testing, we found Seventh Generation Dish Liquid to be the best. It isn\u2019t made with any dyes or synthetic fragrances, which often include questionable ingredients.\n- Non-abrasive sponge or scrub brush: A Dobie sponge, for example, or the Full Circle Tenacious C Cast Iron Brush or 10-inch Lodge Care Scrub Brush.\n- Kosher salt: For stuck-on bits.\n- Wooden spatula: If you don\u2019t already have one, we like the inexpensive Helen\u2019s Asian Kitchen 13-Inch Bamboo Stir Fry Spatula.\n- A neutral oil: Think canola or vegetable oil.\n- Paper towels or a clean rag: For rubbing the oil.\nFor deep-cleaning tasks like removing burnt-on crud or rust\n- A scrubbing tool: Consider a Scotch-Brite sponge or a Lodge Rust Eraser (for small rust spots).\n- Rubber gloves: To protect your hands from cleansers and rust.\n- Stainless steel scrubber: Scotch-Brite scrubbers, for example.\n- Cleanser: We like Bar Keepers Friend.\n- Items for removing severe rust: Distilled white vinegar and a container big enough to submerge the pan.\nHow long will it take to clean?\nFor everyday cleaning, set aside one to two minutes. If you need to re-season your pan, plan for two to three hours. Deeper cleans, such as removing layers of stuck-on buildup, removing rust, or removing stains from enameled cast iron, can take five minutes to 24 hours.\nHow to clean a cast-iron skillet after everyday cooking\nThe most important thing to remember about cast iron is that it can\u2019t go in the dishwasher or stay in a sinkful of water overnight, as it will rust. (All is not lost if it does\u2014we offer some tips for removing rust below.) In addition, cast iron is quite brittle, so don\u2019t \u201cshock\u201d a hot pan by running it under cold water, or the drastic temperature change could cause it to warp or crack.\nContrary to popular belief, washing your pans with mild dish soap will not hurt them, as long as they\u2019re well seasoned. Even Lodge endorses the use of a small amount of soap on its website, as do cleaning experts such as Cheryl Mendelson, author of Home Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House.\nAfter cooking with your pan\nGently scrub the pan using mild dish soap, hot water, and a non-abrasive sponge (such as a Dobie sponge or the soft side of a Scotch-Brite sponge) or a scrub brush.\nRinse it clean and then dry it completely with a dish towel. You can also put it over low heat on the stovetop or in the oven (at 200 to 300 degrees Fahrenheit) to be sure all of the moisture evaporates. It\u2019s important to get your pan bone dry before storing it, otherwise it may rust.\nAfter drying, coat the pan in a very thin layer of the same neutral oil (like canola) that you use for seasoning the pan (a couple of drops is all you need). Using a paper towel or clean rag, rub the oil all over the inside and outside of the pan (including the handle).\nIf your pan has stuck-on bits\nOccasionally small patches of the cast iron\u2019s seasoning will wear down and become thin, causing food to stick to the pan. If you\u2019re struggling to remove stuck-on food, next time, while the pan is warm (not hot), add \u00bc cup kosher salt and a few drops of warm water. Use a Dobie sponge, a Scotch-Brite sponge, or a scrub brush to gently remove the gunk. The salt will dissolve as you scrub and won\u2019t damage the seasoning (it\u2019s like a facial for your pan!). Wash, dry, and wipe the pan with oil as usual.\nUse the boiling water method if food is really stuck on\nAdd 1 to 2 cups of water to the pan and bring it to a boil over high heat until the gunk loosens. If the food bits don\u2019t come off on their own after a couple of minutes, you can use a wooden spatula to scrape them up. I\u2019ve tested the Lodge pan scrapers, which are made exclusively for this purpose, but I\u2019ve found that a wooden spatula works just as well. Afterward, wash, dry, and wipe the pan with oil as usual.\nHow to remove rust from cast iron\nWhether a well-intentioned houseguest leaves your pan to air dry after washing or a few errant drops of water or moisture in the air seek out your lovingly cared-for pan, rust happens. The simplest way to remove rust is using the rough side of a dry Scotch-Brite sponge to gently rub it off. You can add a little water and a drop of dish soap if necessary. Rinse the pan, dry it thoroughly, and then re-season it.\nTry a rust eraser\nIf your cast iron has more than a few rust spots, a rust eraser will help remove rust from a large area. I tested two: the Dalstrong Rust Eraser and the Lodge Rust Eraser. The Lodge eraser, which is made of rubber and silicon carbide, costs less, worked a bit faster in my tests, and didn\u2019t need to be soaked in water before use like the Dalstrong eraser.\nSimply rub the rust eraser, gently, on rusty spots to remove them. But be sure to apply only light to medium pressure when using a rust eraser, or it can cause microcracking, according to Kun Wang, an assistant professor in the Materials Science and Engineering Department at Alfred University. These invisible surface cracks make the pan more susceptible to breakage later.\nOnce you\u2019ve removed the rust, wash and thoroughly dry the pan. Follow the steps to re-season your pan.\nIf a cast-iron piece is completely covered in rust\nIf you accidentally leave your pan in the sink overnight and it rusts all over, or if you pick one up secondhand and it\u2019s covered in rust, don\u2019t fret.\nThe simplest way to remove a lot of rust from cast iron is to make a slurry of Bar Keepers Friend and a couple of tablespoons of water in the pan and scrub the rust off using a stainless steel scrubber. We recommend wearing rubber gloves. Again, wash, dry, and re-season your pan afterward.\nIf the pan is coated in a thick layer of rust that\u2019s too difficult to scrub off by hand, you can remove it by submerging the pan in a solution of vinegar and water. This method is very fast and effective, but Wang cautioned that leaving the pan in the solution for too long can damage the pan. Keep an eye on the pan and remove it as soon as most of the rust is gone or when the rust looks manageable enough to scrub off.\nStart by filling a container large enough to completely submerge the pan with equal parts distilled white vinegar and water. A plastic bin works well, but you can also use a large casserole dish depending on the size of your pan. If you have rust only on the interior of your pan, you can instead fill it with the vinegar solution rather than submerging the whole pan.\nAdd the pan to the solution. Eventually you\u2019ll hear the solution fizzing a bit, which means it\u2019s working its magic. Check the pan after an hour to see if the rust has been mostly removed or has become thin enough to scrub off. If the pan needs more time, return it to the solution until most of the rust is gone, but do not leave it submerged for more than 24 hours, or you could cause permanent damage to the pan.\nRemove the pan from the solution and immediately rinse it with running water. If flash rust (a thin layer of rust that develops as soon as you remove the cast iron from the vinegar solution) appears, don\u2019t worry.\nMake a slurry of Bar Keepers Friend and a couple of tablespoons of water in the pan and scrub any remaining rust off using a stainless steel scrubber.\nWash, dry, and re-season the pan afterward.\nHow to re-season cast iron\nBare cast iron is highly susceptible to corrosion, so if you\u2019ve stripped away any of the seasoning (the black protective layer of polymerized oil) in the process of cleaning or just normal use, you need to re-season your pan to prevent rust and restore its naturally nonstick cooking surface.\nMost brand-new pans, including the Lodge skillets we recommend in our guide to the best cast-iron skillet, come pre-seasoned and are ready for use, but you can add more layers of seasoning if you prefer. We recommend adding more layers of seasoning to a new pan (or waiting for them to build up naturally over time by cooking fatty foods such as bacon) before cooking acidic foods like tomatoes or citrus, otherwise your food may end up tasting metallic.\nPlace the pan in the oven and preheat it to 450 to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.\nAfter five to 10 minutes, carefully remove the pan and use a paper towel or a clean rag to rub a very small amount of oil all over the entire surface inside and out (don\u2019t forget the handle). We have used canola, soybean, sunflower, and other neutral oils for this step.\nYou can use a cotton swab to get into the nooks and crannies if you need to. With a separate, clean towel, wipe all of the excess oil off the pan (it should look nearly dry). Too much oil produces a blotchy, uneven seasoning and can generate a lot of smoke during the baking step, which comes next.\nBake your pan, inverted, in the preheated oven for one hour, and then turn off the oven and let your pan cool completely inside it. The high heat may cause some light smoke during the seasoning process, so be sure to use your range hood or open a window to ventilate.\nRepeat the above steps several times (or as necessary) until you\u2019ve built up multiple layers of seasoning and the coating is sufficiently nonstick (you should be able to fry an egg in butter or oil without it sticking).\nThe best way to maintain the seasoning on cast iron is to use the pan often. I leave my skillet on the stove so that it\u2019s always at hand. Cooking bacon and other fatty foods in it from time to time also helps develop a strong seasoning.\nWhat oil should you use?\nIn our tests over the years, we\u2019ve used a variety of neutral oils to season cast iron, including canola (rapeseed), soybean, sunflower, linseed (flax), grapeseed, refined coconut, vegetable oil blends, and vegetable shortening. They all work well to create a durable seasoning. According to Eric Decker, professor and department head of the Department of Food Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, oils with increased levels of unsaturation will oxidize faster and make more polymers. So avoid using saturated fats, such as butter, which won\u2019t season properly.\nSome cast-iron experts we spoke to also said to avoid extra virgin olive oil because it begins to degrade at a lower temperature and can become sticky or develop off-flavors.\nHow to completely strip a cast iron pan (and when to do it)\nIf you\u2019ve picked up a vintage pan that has decades of carbon buildup from burnt-on grease, you have a few ways to remove all that crud so that you can start fresh. But some of these methods are very time consuming, and others are outright dangerous. In our experience, we\u2019ve found that the easiest way to strip cast iron is to use an oven cleaner solution, since it\u2019s mostly hands-off.\nHowever, oven cleaners are highly toxic, and you should use them for this purpose only outside or in a well-ventilated space such as a garage. And you must wear rubber gloves, as oven cleaner can cause chemical burns. Most oven cleaners are lye-based (it contains sodium hydroxide), so their effect is similar to soaking your pan in a lye bath (which is what many pros do), but they\u2019re easier and safer to use, and they require less equipment and setup.\nWearing rubber gloves and a respirator mask, place the pan in a large trash bag. Carefully spray the oven cleaner over the entire surface of the pan inside and out, including the handle.\nInvert the pan and tie the bag closed. Let the pan rest for several hours, or up to 24 hours depending on the severity of the crud you\u2019re trying to remove.\nWearing rubber gloves, carefully remove the pan from the bag. Rinse the pan and thoroughly scrub it inside and out using dish soap and a stainless steel scrubber. For good measure, scrub it with dish soap a second time and rinse it just to be sure you\u2019ve removed all of the oven cleaner.\nDry the pan thoroughly with a towel; you can then place it in a warm oven or over low heat on your stovetop to remove any remaining moisture. Follow the steps above to re-season the pan.\nOther ways to strip cast iron\nMost cast-iron collectors who restore vintage pieces use a lye bath or electrolysis (some also use sandblasting, but that can cause microcracking, which makes the pan more susceptible to damage) to strip old pans. However, these methods can be relatively dangerous, require specific equipment, and are overkill if you plan to strip only one pan.\nA more hands-off method for stripping a pan is placing it in an oven and running the self-cleaning cycle (if your oven has that feature). However, the self-cleaning cycle has been known to cause damage to some ovens, so we\u2019re hesitant to recommend this method.\nI tested three ways to strip a pan: using Easy-Off Professional Oven and Grill Cleaner, ammonia, and Bar Keepers Friend. Ammonia stinks and does not remove nearly as much crud as the other methods. (I placed the pan in a trash bag along with \u00bd cup ammonia in an open container, sealed the bag, and let it rest for 24 hours. Unfortunately, not much happened.)\nScrubbing the pan with Bar Keepers Friend and a stainless steel scrubber stripped the pan well. It\u2019s a good option if you\u2019re averse to using oven cleaner (which requires numerous safety precautions), but it requires a lot of elbow grease.\nCleaning a Dutch oven and other enameled cast iron\nEveryday cleaning\nEnameled cast iron is easier to care for than unfinished cast iron because it doesn\u2019t need seasoning. Though most enameled cast iron is dishwasher-safe, many manufacturers recommend washing such pieces by hand to avoid wearing down the enamel finish.\nBe sure to let the cast iron cool first to avoid damage from thermal shock, which could warp or crack either the pot or the enamel. For everyday cleaning, use a non-abrasive sponge such as a Dobie sponge with hot water and regular dish soap. According to Lodge: \u201cCitrus juices and citrus-based cleaners (including some dishwasher detergents) should not be used, as they can dull the exterior gloss.\u201d\nStuck-on food should come off if you boil 1 to 2 cups of water in the pan for several minutes and then scrape up the gunk with a wooden spatula. Never use steel wool, abrasive scrubbing pads, or harsh detergents that could scratch the enamel.\nKeep in mind that the enamel will dull with age and some staining is normal, but neither occurrence will impair the performance of your cookware.\nDeep cleaning enameled cast iron\nIf the interior of your enameled cast-iron cookware is lightly stained or the outside of the pot is covered in grease stains, you can remove them by making a slurry of a couple of tablespoons of Bar Keepers Friend or baking soda and warm water. Use a non-abrasive sponge (such as a Dobie sponge) to gently scrub away the stains. Bar Keepers Friend can also remove metal scuffs from the enamel (though you should use cooking utensils made only from wood, silicone, or other soft materials to avoid scratching the enamel in the first place).\nStain removal\nFor dark, stubborn stains, fill the pot or pan with one part bleach to three parts water and let the solution sit for several hours, or up to 24 hours depending on the severity of the discoloration. Rinse and thoroughly wash the pot with a non-abrasive sponge, dish soap, and hot water\u2014no scrubbing required.\nOur thoughts on products marketed specifically for cast iron\nIn writing this guide, we tested many cleaning methods and products that were specifically marketed to extend the life of cast iron or make cleaning easier. But we found that most of them were not worth your money.\nSoaps and scrubs\nYou can find special cast-iron soaps, but after testing both the Camp Chef Cast-Iron Cleaner and the Caron & Doucet Cast Iron Soap, I don\u2019t recommend them. Both formulations contain oils and/or wax, which left a greasy film on my pans. I found it much more effective to use regular dish soap and then oil the pan after.\nYou\u2019ll also find items sold specifically to remove stuck-on food from cast-iron pans, such as the pricey Caron & Doucet Cast Iron Scrub, which is just salt combined with coconut oil and essential oils. Regular kosher salt is just as effective as removing caked-on food, and it\u2019s way less expensive.\nBrushes\nYou can use any scrub brush to clean cast-iron pans as long as the bristles aren\u2019t too stiff or rough, which could wear down the seasoning.\nI tested a few brushes advertised specifically for use on cast-iron pans, and I liked both the Full Circle Tenacious C Cast Iron Brush, and the Lodge Care Scrub Brush. The Lodge has softer bristles if you\u2019re concerned about being too rough on your seasoning, but in my tests the two brushes worked equally well.\nChainmail scrubbers\nSome people like to use chainmail scrubbers to remove bits of stuck-on food from their pans, but in testing two, the Knapp Made CM Scrubber and the Lodge ACM10R41 Scrubbing Pad, I didn\u2019t find them to be more effective than the methods described above. If you apply too much pressure, you can actually scratch off your seasoning (as I did, woe is me!). For that reason, I found the chainmail scrubbers more useful for removing the crackly carbon buildup that can develop on the bottom of pans after years of use than for everyday cleaning.\nOil\nOnline cast-iron forums and blog posts are full of varying advice about the best oil to use for seasoning.\nYou can find some oils marketed specifically for seasoning cast iron, but these are just blends of regular cooking oils with fancy labels, so there\u2019s no reason to spend more money on them.\nOne alternative I tested, the Knapp Made Cast Iron Wax, contains beeswax, but it didn\u2019t season any better than the other oils I tested. It\u2019s expensive, and it smelled strongly of beeswax (which gave an off-taste to our fried eggs), so I recommend sticking with the regular oils listed above.\nSeasoning sprays are oils in an aerosol can. They don\u2019t save you time or make seasoning the pan easier since you still have to use a paper towel or rag to distribute the oil over the surface of the pan to create an even coating. You should also avoid using nonstick cooking sprays, such as Pam, which have additives that are not suitable for seasoning.\nSources\nEric Decker, professor and department head of the Department of Food Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, email interview, July 29, 2020\nKun Wang, assistant professor in the Materials Science and Engineering Department at Alfred University, Zoom interview, August 5, 2020\nCheryl Mendelson, Home Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House (pp. 559, 560), November 4, 1999\nHarold McGee, On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen (p. 790), November 23, 2004\nFrequently Asked Questions, Lodge Cast Iron\nHow to Clean Enameled Cast Iron, Lodge Cast Iron\nRachel Elmkies, How To: Clean Stove Burners, BobVila.com\nSheryl Canter, Chemistry of Cast Iron Seasoning: A Science-Based How-To, Sheryl\u2019s Blog, January 28, 2010\nSheryl Canter, Perfect Popovers (& How to Clean and Reseason Cast Iron), Sheryl\u2019s Blog, January 7, 2010\nCleaning and Restoration Methods, Wagner and Griswold Society\nMentioned above\n- We squirted dozens of dish soaps on hundreds of dirty dishes and found that Palmolive Ultra Pure + Clear Dish Liquid is the first dish soap you should consider.The Best Dish Soap\n- To find the best spatula for every scenario, we\u2019ve tested spatulas of all types\u2013\u2013from all-purpose fish spatulas to silicone scrapers.The Best Spatulas\n- After testing 16 cast-iron skillets, we recommend the Lodge Chef Collection 12 Inch Cast Iron Skillet.

      "text": "How to Score a Used KitchenAid, Vitamix, and Other Fancy Kitchen Gear on the Cheap\nInvesting in reliable, long-lasting kitchen tools can make cooking, baking, and cleanup a genuine pleasure.\nOf course, good gear can cost a lot. An iconic Le Creuset Dutch oven or a KitchenAid stand mixer will set you back hundreds of dollars. But if you know where to look, you can find used versions with plenty of life left in them for a fraction of the price.\nI got my first Cuisinart food processor, still in its box, for $5 at a thrift store in Providence, Rhode Island. It served me well for about eight years, until I re-donated it, still in good condition, before a move.\nHigh-quality kitchen tools have staying power, whether you acquire them used or new. For instance, I\u2019ve owned both a hand-me-down KitchenAid from the 1970s and a brand-new one that I bought less than five years ago, and they were remarkably similar in mixing up light cakes and lofting egg whites for meringue, despite their age difference. Our kitchen staff has plenty of similar stories.\nHere\u2019s how to score nice, heirloom-quality kitchen gear for a fraction of their street price, according to Wirecutter experts.\nWhere to shop for used high-end kitchen gear\nNo matter what you seek, secondhand shopping takes patience and luck. You can often find excellent, cheap, used kitchen tools at yard sales, estate sales, flea markets, and even city curbs. But when it comes to the pricier stuff, you\u2019ll usually find more (and better-vetted) options online. For machines, it\u2019s always worth checking if a manufacturer has a refurbished program, which inspects used merchandise before sale and usually offers at least a six-month warranty.\nAfter dozens of purchases, our kitchen staff particularly stands behind buying used KitchenAid stand mixers, Vitamix blenders, enameled iron cookware (think Le Creuset or Staub), enameled steel (like Dansk), tri-ply steel (like All-Clad), cast iron (though prices can be inflated), and some other countertop appliances (though you should avoid used, newer toasters).\nHere are some places to look:\nCertified refurbished programs\nKitchenAid certified refurbished: KitchenAid\u2019s certified refurbished program offers a one-year warranty\u2014the same as KitchenAid warranties for new mixers. You can sometimes find our upgrade pick, the KitchenAid Pro 600 Series 6-Quart Bowl-Lift Stand Mixer, for around $200 (a new one costs more than $550). If you see something you like, senior staff writer and stand mixer expert Lesley Stockton suggests you follow up with a call and talk to a customer service representative to make sure it\u2019s still in stock. Sturdy KitchenAids are great candidates for buying used since they\u2019re durable, repairable, and unlikely to become obsolete, meaning you\u2019ll be able to swap in new attachments now and in the future. You can replace KitchenAid components through the manufacturer and many retailers, so even if one part is missing from a used stand mixer, it\u2019s not a dealbreaker.\nVitamix certified reconditioned: Though we don\u2019t generally consider blenders to be as long-lasting as, say, a stand mixer, Vitamix blenders are powerful enough and expensive enough that it\u2019s worth checking for reconditioned inventory. Lesley, who also writes our guide to the best blenders, says, \u201cI 100% stand by Vitamix refurbs\u2014they\u2019re like new.\u201d Vitamix also offers an impressive three- to five-year warranty (new models come with a seven-year warranty).\nMoccamaster refurbished: Moccamaster offers an impressive five-year warranty on new coffee machines, which is a testament to their staying power. The machines can last years, says supervising kitchen editor Marilyn Ong, who recently bought a 10-year-old used Technivorm Moccamaster coffee maker. Moccamaster\u2019s refurbished program offers a one-year warranty, and you can find our staff-favorite KBGV Select for about $100 less than the list price.\nRefurbished from retailers: You can sometimes find manufacturer-refurbished countertop appliances, including KitchenAid stand mixers, Cuisinart food processors, ice cream machines, and blenders through the likes of Amazon, Target, and Walmart. Be sure to double-check warranty and return policies before purchasing, since they may differ from that of the manufacturer.\nOnline sellers\nYou can find used KitchenAid stand mixers, Le Creuset and Staub cookware, and other nice kitchen tools on eBay, OfferUp, Etsy, Facebook Marketplace, and other direct-from-seller sites. Wirecutter staff warns that you may want to avoid cast-iron pans, which often have inflated prices. You should also proceed with extra caution if you\u2019re buying a machine, since these sites don\u2019t have warranties.\nTo reduce your risk of being scammed, check seller reviews for plenty of positive feedback, which is a good bet that the seller is trustworthy. Follow our guidance on what to look for, and check photos and descriptions carefully to be sure that you\u2019re actually buying the model you want, since some sellers will include a popular brand name to capture search. Remember that if you\u2019re buying from OfferUp or Facebook Marketplace, you have to pay for or arrange shipping.\nLocal brick-and-mortar stores\nOut of the Closet, Savers, Goodwill, Housing Works, and other local donation shops: These retailers accept cookware and bakeware donations and occasionally sell nice gear, so they\u2019re worth browsing. You can sometimes find durable cookware like cast iron and All-Clad tri-ply pans at thrift stores like this, at good prices due to staining that you can clean off at home, says senior kitchen editor Marguerite Preston. You can also find small appliances here, like my $5 Cuisinart food processor, or specialty machines: Staff writer Mace Dent Johnson, who writes our ice cream maker guide, says they\u2019ve spotted our top pick at three separate thrift shops. As a bonus, with in-store shopping, you can better assess an item\u2019s quality. While there, ask if you can plug machines in before purchasing.\nLocal used kitchen stores: I once scored copper canel\u00e9 molds at a used kitchen shop in San Francisco that has now sadly closed, but that was enough for me to start seeking out used kitchen stores everywhere I go. If you\u2019re lucky to live near one of these, they are also worth browsing, though they can be hit or miss and, for vintage items, occasionally overpriced.\nWhat to look for\nBecause new higher-end kitchen tools periodically go on sale, consider the used price in context with the sales price. What\u2019s fair varies across used items and their age and condition, as well as their color. However, at least 30% below full price is a good place to start for this caliber of kitchen gear. Used machines that have not been certified refurbished by a manufacturer should cost less than that.\nHere\u2019s what else to look for:\n- Photos: Look for plenty of photos from all angles, and request more detailed shots. The seller should be willing to provide them, and may even be able to send you a video of a machine in action. The exception to this rule is certified refurbished merchandise, where listings will typically just show the product image. You can trust these sellers, but be sure to read the description thoroughly, since the image may not reflect the exact model or color that you\u2019re buying, and follow up with a call to customer service to verify.\n- Detailed description: The more detail, the better\u2014especially for a machine with moving parts. Check if the seller has described any flaws or wear, however minor, and don\u2019t hesitate to ask for more information. This bears repeating for cookware from brands like Le Creuset and Staub: always check dimensions and quart sizes. Some single-serving versions may look similar to bigger sizes: Don\u2019t mistake a miniature for a steal.\n- Shine or gloss on enamelware cook surfaces: If a seller has taken the time to clean the pot\u2019s interior so you can see a sheen, there\u2019s a good chance that the bottom of the pot will have enamel that\u2019s in good shape. That said, stains are common for used enamelware and steel pans, and they can be cleaned with time and elbow grease. Check out our advice for cleaning enamelware and stainless steel and copper cookware.\n- Return and warranty details: If you\u2019re buying a refurbed machine through another seller such as Amazon, double-check the warranty, terms, and technician checklist. It\u2019s virtually unheard of to find warranties for used Dutch ovens and the like, but check return policies.\nWhat to avoid\nBuying used online involves risk, especially for machines that can have electrical or mechanical issues. Here are some things to avoid.\n- Uncertified used machines: unless it\u2019s just a few bucks at stake and you can try turning on the machine in person. Otherwise, you may be spending a couple hundred dollars for something that has no guarantee of working.\n- Frayed or deteriorating cords: Even if it\u2019s a total steal and turns on, leave a machine with a disintegrating cord behind, since using it may be dangerous.\n- Chipped or flaking enamelware: Look for enamelware with the interior fully intact. Leave cookware with large chips and area-wide flaking, which can expose the cooking surface to rust and affect performance. A couple small chips around the rim are okay and won\u2019t affect performance (although you should be gentle with use and cleaning to avoid further chipping).\n- Scorched enamelware: While you can clean cosmetic stains from enamelware, as we note above, avoid blackened, raised cooking surfaces, which indicate that residue has been scorched on; this can be difficult to clean off, says senior staff writer Michael Sullivan, who\u2019s written our guides to cleaning and maintaining cast-iron and copper cookware.\n- Black interior enamelware: Staub makes some really pretty all-black Dutch ovens with matching black interiors, but unless you really trust the seller, it can be tricky when buying online to tell the condition of the enamel coating if the enamel is black.\n- Hairline cracks and warped bottoms: Inspect cast-iron pans for warps and hairline cracks, which can lead to breakage. Ditto for any component parts on machines.\n- Cast iron that\u2019s $100 and up: Michael, who writes our guide to cleaning and reseasoning cast iron, warns against overspending on cast iron, especially if it\u2019s billed as vintage and collectible. If you\u2019re unsure of a potential purchase\u2019s provenance, refer to online resources like the The Cast Iron Collector, Boonie Hicks, and Wagner & Griswold Society.\n- Fire rings: If you use induction, Lesley, who co-writes our guide to cast-iron skillets, warns that cast iron with a raised ring on the bottom won\u2019t heat effectively, since the bottom of the pan won\u2019t come into full contact with the cooktop.\n- Almost right, but not quite: I once bought a used Dansk K\u00f8benstyle butter warmer in teal that was perfect\u2014except that I don\u2019t like the color teal. I eventually bought a new red Dansk K\u00f8benstyle Butter Warmer, and it makes me really happy, but it isn\u2019t the most sustainable shopping I\u2019ve ever done. Be honest with yourself: if you have strong opinions about the model or color that you want, buying new first can be worth the cost, since you\u2019ll hopefully keep it for a long time.\nWhen to just buy it new\nUsed kitchen gear is not for everybody. If your heart is set on a particular color or model, and you can afford it, buy it new\u2014you\u2019ll get what you want on the first go-around, and you\u2019re likely to keep it for a long time. Carefully considering your purchases so you can make fewer of them also reduces the environmental footprint of your shopping.\nYou can get good discounts on new, high-end gear during sales (for example, our Deals team found an almost 30% discount on our top-pick KitchenAid stand mixer earlier this year).\nBut if you\u2019re not yet sure if you\u2019re ready to pay full or even sale price for a pricey item, and you want to see what all the fuss is about, buying used is one way to find out. Besides, you might be able to find a color that\u2019s no longer in production.\nThis article was edited by Christine Cyr Clisset and Marguerite Preston.\nMentioned above\n- We\u2019ve baked dozens of cakes and hundreds of cookies and even taken apart a few stand mixers to find the best options for baking and beyond.The Best Stand Mixer\n- After testing more than 25 blenders since 2012, we haven\u2019t found a better one than the powerful, durable Vitamix 5200.The Best Blender\n- The Technivorm Moccamaster KBT is one of our favorite drip coffee makers.

      "text": "Story\n1891\nBrothers Milton M. and Bernard P. Wagner of Sidney, Ohio established The Wagner Manufacturing Company. It opened for business in June 1891 with 20 employees on its payroll. Just three months later, it employed 41 men and melted 9,200 pounds of iron daily, with plans to build an addition to the foundry the following year. Cookware, known as hollowware or simply ware at the time, was a growing industry and Wagner would quickly establish itself as a market leader.\n-\n1892\nWagner registered the first patent for its waffle iron, covering an innovative hinge design by R. O. Bingham. Bingham, a mechanic who served as the company's superintendent, would prove to be a prolific designer and his name can be found on four additional patents for the waffle iron alone.\n-\n1894\nA line of cast aluminum cookware was introduced, a first for the industry. That same year, construction began on a new building, the second addition to Wagner's Sidney plant in just three years of business.\n-\n1897\nWagner acquired Sidney Hollowware Company, a local competitor. William H. Wagner, brother of Milton and Bernard, sold his hardware store and joined his family in the cookware business. As the eldest brother, William was tasked with running the new foundry and named president of the company.\n1902\nAdditional polishing machines were installed to accommodate the labor intensive process of finishing the castings. Wagner was a pioneer in both nickel plated cast iron and cast aluminum, both of which required extensive grinding and buffing to achieve their signature luster.\n-\n1904\nWagner was awarded Gold Medal for their cast iron and aluminum cookware on display at the World's Fair in St. Louis. Expositions were a central feature of the company's marketing efforts and it also won awards in Paris, San Francisco and Chicago.\n-\n1905\nThe Sidney Hollowware foundry was sold back to Philip Smith, its original owner. Wagner would build a new, larger foundry on the same site as its primary operations the following year to replace its capacity.\n-\n1908\nInternational distribution of the company's products brought the Wagner brand, and the city of Sidney, global recognition. A navy serviceman from Sidney reported that he found displays of Wagner aluminum cookware in every foreign country he visited.\n1912\nAnother addition to the plant was completed, increasing its size to 160,000 square feet. The plant required a staff of 300 to operate. The Sidney Daily News boasted that their city was home to \"the largest Holloware Plant in the World and one of the most up-to-date factories of its kind in existence.\"\n-\n1915\nThe company introduced its iconic Wagner Ware stylized logo, recognizable for the looped W. At the time, branding was not commonplace for manufacturers, and some of Wagner's competitors neglected to mark their products at all. The logo would remain in use for the majority of the brand's history, through multiple ownership changes.\n-\n1916\nAfter 25 years in business, the Wagner family reflected, \"...we have labored without ceasing to produce a line of kitchen ware which we might be proud to identify with our family name...to be distinguished from all other lines not only because of its superior wearing qualities but by reason of the beauty of the design in which it is expressed.\"\n-\n1934\nThe Magnalite line, made with a proprietary magnesium-aluminum alloy, was introduced. It would prove to be a popular collection and remained a staple in the company's catalog for decades to come.\n1935\nMeanwhile... Following decades on the market with little public interest, electric ranges (stoves) started to gain popularity in the United States. These new appliances were marketed on their ease of use and consistent, predictable heating. An advertisement for the Hotpoint brand proclaimed, \"...it cooks entire meals while mother is shopping or busy with housework.\"\n1941\nWagner introduced pre-seasoned cast iron cookware with the catalog description, \"It is foolproof...it is safe...it is sensational! It eliminates the old varnish-like lacquer that had to be burned or scoured off.\"\n-\n1942\nThe rationing of aluminum during World War II put restrictions on the production of Magnalite cookware. The residents of Sidney were asked to donate scrap metal with a call to \"search for material necessary to win the war.\"\n-\n1946\nA series of stock transfers took place between members of the Wagner family after the passing of founders Bernard and Milton. Company ownership was consolidated among their heirs.\n-\n1948\nA 4-ton washing machine designed for cleaning Magnalite products after polishing was installed at the plant, marking a gradual shift towards automation. Prior to this, the cleaning process was accomplished individually, by hand.\n1950\nMeanwhile... Du Pont opened its first commercial polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) plant in West Virginia. Marketed under the brand name Teflon, this slippery material was first used in industrial applications. Just one year later, it would begin use in commercial food processing as a nonstick coating, paving the way for the era of modern nonstick cookware.\n1952\nThe Wagner family sold their namesake company to The Randall Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, a car parts manufacturer. Jerome and Joseph Wagner, sons of founders Bernard and Milton, respectively, remained on staff as plant managers. For many collectors and enthusiasts, this marks the end of the golden age of the brand and Wagner cookware produced after this time is generally less prized.\n-\n1957\nRandall purchased The Griswold Manufacturing Company of Erie, Pennsylvania, one of Wagner's primary competitors. The two brands would be traded together in future acquisitions.\n-\n1959\nRandall, and Wagner and its subsidiary, was acquired by Textron Incorporated. Under Textron ownership, the brand continued to operate as a division of Randall, its products marketed as Randall Made Wagner Ware.\n-\n1965\nAs nonstick cookware gained popularity and widespread use, Wagner introduced a line of cast iron skillets coated with mint green Teflon. An advertisement promised \"old fashioned cookability with modern rinse-away washing.\"\n1969\nGeneral Housewares Corporation, established just two years prior, bought the Textron housewares line, including Wagner, as part of a series of acquisitions in the housewares market. GHC would prove to be a powerful force in the industry, successfully operating numerous manufacturing locations and distributing its products under an assortment of brands.\n-\n1974\nModern upgrades were installed at the plant including cupola emission controls to meet new environmental standards, as well as an air filtration system for the health and safety of its 400 employees. By this time, the casting process was largely automated, with the molding line producing five molds per minute.\n-\n1987\nGeneral Housewares discontinued the use of the Wagner Ware trademark and launched a new Wagner product line, confusingly marketed as Wagner's 1891 Original. This new collection featured redesigned handles with a distinctive thumb rest and seasoning instructions cast into the bottom of each piece.\n-\n1996\nGeneral Housewares closed its Wagner division. Following months of uncertainty and negotiations, a group of investors purchased the assets, including the foundry in Sidney. The newly formed group, incorporated under the name Wagnerware Corporation, continued manufacturing cookware at that location.\n1999\nWagnerware Corp struggled to find its footing and its stewardship of the brand was short lived. The plant closed for a scheduled break in July 1999 but never reopened and the property fell into receivership. Subsequent, unaffiliated owners abandoned the property shortly thereafter and left the building in disrepair, and no Wagner cookware was produced at that location after the end of the 20th century.\n-\n2015\nThe market for new and vintage cast iron cookware grew, bringing Wagner and its contemporaries renewed interest and attention.\n-\n2019\nHistoric reference materials were obtained from libraries and private collectors. Product development began for Wagner's next chapter.\n-\n2021\nThe Wagner family of Sidney, Ohio, descendants of the founders, joined the project. Their insight, guidance and support would be invaluable for re-launching the brand their ancestors built.\n2022\nA new generation was introduced to Wagner through a series of reissued products. The vintage designs were studied in exhaustive detail in order to recapture the look, feel and quality of the originals.\nLong Griddle No. 1148\nThis griddle is a functional tribute to the history of American cast iron."
