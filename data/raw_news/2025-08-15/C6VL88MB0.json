  "title": "Is Arsenal The Frontrunner To Win The Premier League This Season?",
  "description": "Is this finally Arsenal's season to end its long wait to win the Premier League title after three seasons of finishing second?",
  "content": "Arsenal knows what it feels like to be within touching distance of the Premier League trophy without being able to put hands on it. The Gunners have finished second in the table in each of the last three seasons, losing out to Liverpool last term and Manchester City in the two campaigns before that.\n\nThere are, however, signs that Arsenal could end its long way to become English champions for the first time since the days of Arsene Wenger. Competition at the top of the table will be stiff, but the North London outfit has enjoyed a positive summer and finally has the squad to make the final step in its development.\n\nLast season, Mikel Arteta\u2019s team was too predictable in attack. Arsenal struggled to break down opponents that sat deep and asked the Gunners to find a way to goal. This is why Arteta has focused on broadening his options in the final third, bringing in Viktor Gyokeres and Noni Madueke over the summer transfer window.\n\nGyokeres will give Arsenal greater penalty box presence. The Swedish striker scored 54 goals for Sporting CP last season and has been signed by the Gunners to sharpen their cutting edge. There were times last season when the likes of Kai Havertz and Gabriel Martinelli missed one too many chances in tight games. The hope is Gyokeres will address this.\n\nMadueke might not be a starting figure, but the 23-year-old will offer some useful depth behind Bukayo Saka who is Arsenal\u2019s most important attacking figure. Saka has suffered injury problems in recent seasons and so Madueke gives Arteta another rotation option on the right side of the forward line.\n\nIn midfield, Martin Zubimendi arrived from Real Sociedad to provide control in the centre of the pitch. Zubimendi has already shown signs of forging an understanding with Declan Rice which could help to get more out of Martin Odegaard who struggled to find his best form in the second half of last season.\n\nChristian Norgaard was a threat from set pieces for Brentford before making the move across London to the Emirates stadium this summer. The Dane, like Madueke, probably won\u2019t be a starting figure in the majority of matches, but Arsenal has strengthened to give itself a chance of fighting on all fronts for silverware this season.\n\nLiverpool has also strengthened, but may have to integrate as many as five new starters this season. Chelsea and Manchester City have similarly brought in a huge number of new players and so Arsenal could have a head-start on many of its rivals. This could be the season the Gunners have been waiting for.",
