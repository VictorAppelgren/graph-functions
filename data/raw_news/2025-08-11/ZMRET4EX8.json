  "content": "OBERHOFEN, Switzerland \u2014 Two Olympic gold medalist ski jumpers and three staffers on the powerful Norway men\u2019s team were charged with ethics violations Monday after an investigation into alleged tampering with ski suits at the world championships.\n\nThe International Ski and Snowboard Federation said star ski jumpers Marius Lindvik and Johann Andr\u00e9 Forfang, two coaches and a member of the service staff were formally charged as part of an investigation into \u201cequipment manipulation\u201d at the Nordic worlds Norway hosted in March.\n\nIllegally modified suits can help athletes fly further with more aerodynamic resistance.\n\nThe allegations \u2014 backed by video footage and quick confessions by team officials \u2014 shook the tight-knit communities of ski jumping and Norwegian sports when they emerged on the final weekend in Trondheim.\n\nNo timetable was given for hearings or verdicts in a case that intensifies less than six months before the next Winter Olympics open in northern Italy.\n\nBans, fines and disqualification of results are on the slate of punishments open to the FIS Ethics Committee, the governing body said in a statement.\n\nLindvik\u2019s gold medal in the men\u2019s normal hill event at the worlds held in Trondheim, plus Norway\u2019s bronze in the men\u2019s team event on the large hill are clearly at risk.\n\nFIS said the investigation conducted 38 witness interviews and examined 88 pieces of evidence, and that no one else will be charged in the case.\n\nLindvik and Forfang, who both were in the team that took bronze, denied involvement in March though were disqualified from the individual large hill event and suspended by FIS for the rest of the season. Their charges were signed off by the FIS ruling council, the governing body said.\n\nThe 27-year-old Lindvik has been expected to defend his Olympic title next year in the men\u2019s large hill event at the Milan-Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo Winter Games. Forfang, now 30, took team gold on the large hill and individual silver on the normal hill at the 2018 Olympics held in South Korea.\n\nAdmissions of guilt were made in March by head coach Magnus Brevik and equipment manager Adrian Livelten, who said suits were altered only before the men\u2019s large hill event.\n\n\u201cWe regret it like dogs, and I\u2019m terribly sorry that this happened,\u201d Brevik said at the time. A third team staffer, Thomas Lobben, also is now charged.\n\nThe manipulation was to increase the size of suits pre-approved and microchipped by FIS, and was captured on secretly filmed footage. It led to formal protests from the Austria, Slovenia and Poland teams.\n\nThe alterations could be confirmed only by tearing apart the seams of the crotch area on the Norwegian ski suits.\n\nThe case will be judged by three members of the ethics panel which must reach verdicts \u201cno later than 30 days after the hearing process is concluded,\u201d FIS said.\n\nFIS has already tightened up its rules on ski jump suits, something which caused a spate of disqualifications when athletes gathered for the first competition of the new season Saturday. FIS said that was down to technical issues and it didn\u2019t suspect \u201cill intent.\u201d",

      "text": "Ski Jumping: charges brought against Norwegian officials and athletes\nAug 11, 2025\u00b7Inside FISThree Norwegian Ski Jumping officials and two athletes have been charged for violations of the FIS Universal Code of Ethics and the FIS Rules on the Prevention of Manipulation of Competitions as a result of an investigation conducted by the FIS Independent Ethics and Compliance Office (IECO) that started shortly after allegations of illegal equipment manipulation at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships Trondheim 2025.\nThe cases of Norway\u2019s team coach Magnus Brevik, assistant coach Thomas Lobben, service staff member Adrian Livelten, as well as of athletes Marius Lindvik and Johann Andr\u00e9 Forfang, will now be referred to the FIS Ethics Committee (FEC) for adjudication.\nThe decisions\nAfter the IECO completed its investigation and submitted its report to the FIS Integrity Director, the process for deciding whether to bring charges against various individuals was as follows:\nThe IECO and the FIS Integrity Department agreed to bring charges against Magnus Brevik, Thomas Lobben, and Adrian Livelten for violations both of the FIS Universal Code of Ethics and the FIS Rules on the Prevention of Manipulation of Competitions. Therefore, in accordance with the FIS IECO Procedural Rules, the matter has been referred directly to the FIS Ethics Committee.\nIn accordance with the FIS IECO Procedural Rules, the decision on whether to bring charges against Marius Lindvik and Johann Andr\u00e9 Forfang was taken to the FIS Council, which voted to bring charges against the two athletes for violations both of the FIS Universal Code of Ethics and the FIS Rules on the Prevention of Manipulation of Competitions. Accordingly, the cases have been referred to the FIS Ethics Committee.\nThe IECO and the FIS Integrity Department agreed not to bring charges against any other athlete or member of the Norwegian National Ski Association or any other party connected to the investigation. In accordance with the FIS IECO Procedural Rules, the decision was submitted to the FIS Council, which confirmed that all matters are closed in respect of all other individuals connected to this investigation.\nThe next steps\nThe FIS Ethics Committee will now consider the IECO\u2019s investigation report and decide on whether there have been infringements of the FIS Universal Code of Ethics and/or the FIS Rules on the Prevention of the Manipulation of Competitions.\nA panel of three unconflicted members of the FEC will be appointed by the Chair of the FEC to adjudicate the case. The chairperson of the panel will contact the interested parties to communicate the next procedural steps, which may involve convening a hearing or otherwise coordinating further submissions from concerned parties.\nAfter the conclusion of the hearing process, the FEC will announce its decision whether to impose any sanctions on any of the parties no later than 30 days after the hearing process is concluded.\nOther relevant questions and answers\nWhat sanctions are available to the FEC?\nThe sanctioning powers of the FEC include imposition of a period of ineligibility, financial sanctions, or disqualification of results.\nAny period of ineligibility will start on the date the decision of the FEC is published. The panel may, at its sole discretion, reduce the period of ineligibility based on any period of provisional suspension already served prior to the decision being reached.\nWhat will be communicated by the FEC after it has reached its conclusion?\nIf the conclusion by the FEC is that a violation of the FIS Universal Code of Ethics or the FIS Rules on the Prevention of the Manipulation of Competitions has been committed, the decision will be publicly disclosed in full \u2212 after prior notice is given to the interested parties \u2212 no later than 20 days after it is issued.\nIf a person is exonerated of all charges, then the decision may only be publicly disclosed with the consent of the person who is the subject of the decision. However, the FEC may publicly disclose the fact that the charge has been dismissed.\nWhat is the appeal process on any potential sanctions?\nAn aggrieved party can appeal against any sanction to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. FIS may also appeal against any decision by the FEC not to apply a sanction.\nWhat exactly did the IECO investigate?\nThe terms of reference of the IECO investigation were to examine whether there had been any violations of the FIS Universal Code of Ethics and/or the FIS Rules on the Prevention of Manipulation of Competitions. Specifically, the IECO investigation looked at five key issues, i.e. whether:\ncoaches Magnus Brevig and Thomas Lobben and suit technician acted in violation of the rules in orchestrating the equipment manipulation;\nathletes Marius Lindvik and Johann Andr\u00e9 Forfang knowingly acted in contravention of relevant FIS rules;\nthe conspiracy spread further in the team, either to other athletes or other staff members of the Norwegian NSA;\nthe Norwegian team had engaged in the same or similar equipment violations in the past; and/or\nthe conspiracy spread to other teams.\nWho gets to see the IECO investigation report?\nThe FIS Integrity Director is in possession of the report, which is the result of a thorough investigation process that included 38 key witness interviews and the examination of 88 key exhibits.\nThe FIS Council has received a redacted summary of the report and a verbal debrief to help them come to a decision as to whether to bring charges against the individuals considered in the report.\nRecipients of Notices of Charge have also received redacted versions of the report including findings in relation to their respective involvement only. The FEC has been copied as a recipient of these Notices of Charge and therefore of the same redacted versions as the recipients.\nAll other parties concerned have been or will be offered a verbal debrief of the report with the IECO and the Lead Investigator."
