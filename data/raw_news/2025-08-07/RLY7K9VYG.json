  "description": "The writer-director Zach Cregger (\u201cBarbarian\u201d) creates and maintains an ominous mood in this horror movie about missing children.",
  "content": "All the kids were students in the same class. Their teacher, Justine (Julia Garner), has almost predictably become the focus of some parents\u2019 confusion and rage. She insists that she had nothing to do with the disappearance and loved the kids, though few parents seem to buy what she says, including Archer (Josh Brolin), whose son is among the missing. Her boss, Marcus (an appealing Benedict Wong), is sympathetic but his patience has its limits, particularly given some of Justine\u2019s tut-tut behavior at school. She\u2019s previously breached protocol, mostly, it seems, by being nice to students. That she could probably breeze through the winding aisles of her local liquor store with her eyes closed seems more concerning.\n\nCregger has divided the narrative into sections that are driven by different characters, which allows him to put competing viewpoints into play. After some place setting (this is a true story, an unseen girl warns in voice-over), Justine revs things up, getting the party started. Garner is a pleasurably idiosyncratic actress, and while she can reliably commit to whatever nonsense her characters deal with, she has a native resiliency. She seems canny; she can play tough. Garner\u2019s Justine is jittery and given to lonely-night boozing, but while the character is a mess, the actress\u2019s intelligence gives you confidence that she will clean up when need be.\n\nCregger has clearly made a study of horror films and thrillers, and he understands the importance of pacing as well as how laughs can amplify scares. He winds you up, keeps you edge, calms you down only to wind you up again. At the same time, because he has divided the movie into segments that develop the story from various points of view, the tension tends to pulse on and off like a hard-working blender.\n\nOne problem is that not all the viewpoints are equally engaging. The other is that as Justine\u2019s part gives way to other sections \u2014 including ones fronted by Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams, Cary Christopher and a very fine Amy Madigan \u2014 the segmentation and overlapping just feel like a whole lot of delay tactics.\n\nNarrative delay is central to suspense, though it can be frustrating when you feel like you\u2019re being strung along (and along) and your anticipation isn\u2019t satisfyingly rewarded. \u201cWeapons\u201d has a grabber opening and a shocker of a finale that\u2019s so outlandish \u2014 and so shrewdly staged, shot and cut \u2014 that you laugh-gasp in appreciation. The stuff in between the start and the finish isn\u2019t as successful, including a murder that edges into gleeful sadism and some disappointingly creaky horror-film clich\u00e9s. \u201cWeapons\u201d may not be about anything much other than Cregger\u2019s talent, but the guy knows how to slither under your skin \u2014 and stay there.\n\nWeapons\n\nRated R for gruesome violence and woo-woo scares. Running time: 2 hours 8 minutes. In theaters.",

  "summary": "The film \"Weapons\" follows the story of a teacher, Justine (Julia Garner), who claims she had nothing to do with the disappearance of her students and is the focus of parents' confusion and rage. The film is told by Cregger, who divides the narrative into sections driven by different characters and uses competing viewpoints to create tension. Despite these challenges, the film is praised for its ability to maintain suspense and pacing, while not all viewpoints are equally engaging. The movie's finale is lauded for being so outlandish that it makes it feel so much appreciated. Despite some criticism about the length of the film, the overall presentation of the movie is praised.",
