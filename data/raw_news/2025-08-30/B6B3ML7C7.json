  "content": "President Donald Trump has demanded Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell lower interest rates this year, but there's a big reason why his pressure campaign will probably prove futile.That's because Powell, who's 11 months away from the end of his term as central bank chief, is likely going to want to preserve his legacy and protect the Fed's independence, even as he faces withering criticisms from the president, according to economic experts.The president is reportedly considering announcing Powell's successor as soon as this fall, The Wall Street Journal reported this week, a move that could be read as trying to undermine Powell's influence before the end of his term next May.The president also took to Truth Social this week to call the central bank leader \"too late\" and a \"very dumb, hardheaded person.\" Later, when speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Trump added that he believed Powell was \"terrible\" and \"very stupid,\" and that the Fed Chair had \"a very low IQ for what he does.\"David Rosenberg, a top economist and CEO of Rosenberg Research, told Business Insider he believed the insults Trump hurled at Powell this week were \"self-defeating.\" If anything, they will make Powell less likely to cut rates, as the central bank chief will try to avoid creating the impression that the Fed is buckling under political pressure, Rosenberg said.\"Donald Trump has shot himself in the foot,\" Rosenberg said. \"Of course, Jay Powell, less than a year away from the expiration of his tenure, is going to want to preserve his legacy. And the Fed continues to feel some shame and a loss of credibility from inflation being transitory back in 2021 and 2022,\" he added, pointing to when the Fed brushed off rising inflation as a temporary phenomenon before embarking on a steep rate-hike cycle to combat it.In the past, economists have warned the Fed could damage its credibility by not remaining independent, something that could lead to higher inflation in the long run.The idea that Powell will remain focused on preserving the Fed's independence is a prominent narrative swirling in markets at the moment, according to Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at Allianz.\"That Chair Powell now is in love with the notion that his legacy will be protecting Fed independence,\" El-Erian said in an interview on CNBC on Thursday. \"That will replace any concerns about the inflation surge we've had,\" he added.Forecasters also doubt rates will fall all that much, regardless of what Trump or Powell do.While Trump is likely to pick a more dovish successor to Powell, lowering interest rates will be harder than simply getting a new Fed chief, El-Erian said, as the new Fed Chair would need to come to a consensus on where the Fed funds rate should be with other central bankers.\"It's not as straightforward as, 'I pick this person. By definition, rates are going to come down,'\" he said.Jim Zelter, the president of Apollo Global Management, said he believes rates would likely stay higher in the short term. The US is still dealing with inflationary pressures in the supply chain and the job market, and economic benefits from AI and other tech advances are still far out into the future, he said.\"I have a view that rates are going to be a little bit stickier and higher in the US than people think,\" Zelter said, speaking to Bloomberg this week.Investors grew more bullish on the prospect of rate cuts this week, but still don't expect the Fed to significantly reduce interest rates anytime soon. Markets are pricing in a 79% chance the Fed will keep rates steady at its July meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool.Trump has feuded with Powell for years over lowering rates, but the president appears to be even more dogged in his attempts to spar with Powell and push for rate cuts this year, after promising Americans lower borrowing costs on the campaign trail.In April, Trump teased firing Powell before walking back those comments as markets balked at political meddling with central bank policy. In October, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent \u2014 who is one of the contenders for the next Fed Chief, according to the Journal's report \u2014 also floated the idea of a \"shadow Fed Chair.\" The shadow chair would be a Fed Chair announced before the end of Powell's term, who could indicate to markets what to expect after Powell is gone, Bessent told Barron's at the time.Zelter said he doubted Trump would follow through and announce a new Fed Chair extremely early. That's because Trump is in a convenient position right now to blame the Fed for things happening in the economy, Zelter said.",
