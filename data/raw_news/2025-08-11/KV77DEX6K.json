  "title": "EU leaders say Ukraine should have freedom to decide its future ahead of Trump-Putin summit",
  "description": "Statement on Ukrainian sovereignty endorsed by all European Union leaders except for Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n",
  "content": "All but one of the European heads of state and government have said that Ukrainians must have the freedom to decide their future, ahead of a high-stakes summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.\n\n\u201cMeaningful negotiations can only take place in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities,\u201d the leaders said, adding that \u201cwe share the conviction that a diplomatic solution must protect Ukraine\u2019s and Europe\u2019s vital security interests.\u201d\n\nThe statement, which was agreed late on Monday and published on Tuesday, was endorsed by leaders of all EU member countries except Hungary.\n\nEuropeans are attempting to exert some influence over the Friday meeting that they have been sidelined from. It remains unclear whether even Ukraine will take part. On Monday, Trump confirmed that he and the Russian president would discuss \u201cland swapping\u201d when they meet.\n\nThe Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945, might secure favourable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them.\n\nTuesday\u2019s statement was also meant to be a demonstration of European unity. However, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who is Putin\u2019s closest ally in Europe and has tried to block EU support for Ukraine, did not endorse it, the only one of the 27 leaders who refused to do so.\n\nIn the statement early on Tuesday, the leaders said they \u201cwelcome the efforts of President Trump towards ending Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine\u201d. But, they underlined, \u201cthe path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cA just and lasting peace that brings stability and security must respect international law, including the principles of independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and that international borders must not be changed by force,\u201d they said.\n\nZelenskyy has rejected the idea that Ukraine must commit to give up land to secure a ceasefire. Russia holds shaky control over four of the country\u2019s regions, two in the country\u2019s east and two in the south.\n\nTrump was also critical of Zelenskyy in his address on Monday, noting that Ukraine\u2019s leader had been in power for the duration of the war and said \u201cnothing happened\u201d during that time.\n\nEuropeans leaders will make a fresh attempt to rally Trump to Ukraine\u2019s cause on Wednesday at virtual meetings convened by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Trump did not confirm whether he would take part, but he did say: \u201cI\u2019m going to get everybody\u2019s ideas\u201d before meeting with Putin.\n\nWith Reuters and the Associated Press",

      "text": "Donald Trump has confirmed that he and Vladimir Putin will discuss \u201cland swapping\u201d when they meet on Friday in Alaska for a high-stakes summit on the Ukraine war. But the US president expressed frustration with Volodymyr Zelenskyy for putting conditions on such a potential agreement.\nDuring a news conference at the White House on Monday, Trump said he was frustrated with Zelenskyy\u2019s insistence that Ukraine would need to hold a national referendum on any peace deal that stipulated recognising Russian control over territory that it has occupied during the war.\n\u201cI was a little bothered by the fact that Zelenskyy was saying I have to get constitutional approval,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe has approval to go to war and kill everybody but he needs approval to do a land swap. Because there will be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody.\u201d\nEuropean diplomats have been taken aback by the lack of clarity on the US side about the territories Putin is demanding from Ukraine and the terms of a ceasefire. The discrepancies within the US reporting back on what Russia is seeking has alarmed European diplomats and only added to a fear that Trump, inflating his personal relationship with Putin, could make damaging concessions.\nDescribing his vision for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said an agreement would include \u201cgood stuff, not bad stuff, also some bad stuff for both\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to change the lines, the battle lines,\u201d he added.\nTrump, increasingly impatient with Putin in recent months, has long said he does not see a ceasefire occurring until he meets the Russian leader in person.\nThe German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, on Monday invited Trump to join emergency virtual talks with EU leaders and Zelenskyy on Wednesday, as European demands grow for the US president to agree red lines before Friday\u2019s summit with Putin.\nNeither Zelenskyy nor European leaders have been invited to Trump\u2019s meeting with the Russian president.\nTrump said on Monday that he would seek to arrange direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy, a proposal that the Russian president has rejected so far.\n\u201cThe next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin, or Zelenskyy and Putin and me. I\u2019ll be there if they need, but I want to have a meeting set up between the two leaders,\u201d Trump said.\nHe said a deal may not be possible and that he saw the upcoming summit as a \u201cfeel-out meeting\u201d, and that he would update Zelenskyy and European leaders if Putin proposed a \u201cfair deal\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll call him after and I may say lots of luck, keep fighting, or I may say we can make a deal,\u201d he said.\nMerz\u2019s office said in a statement that the virtual talks would focus on \u201cfurther options for action to put pressure on Russia\u201d and \u201cpreparations for possible peace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security\u201d.\nIt is not clear whether or not Trump has accepted the invitation to the call.\nEU foreign ministers were meeting in an emergency session to underscore the demand. The UK has also been pressing for wider consultations after Trump unilaterally announced last week that he was going ahead with his first meeting with Putin since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nEuropean leaders say Russia represents an existential threat to the continent and that they should not be excluded from the process. Issues such as the terms of a ceasefire, further sanction pressure on Russia, any proposed territorial swaps and security guarantees for Ukraine would be discussed with the US president in the virtual meeting.\nThere is concern that an unpredictable Trump will be lured into making fatal concessions to Putin, and the meeting would be a chance for him to map out his strategy.\nThe Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said he was optimistic that the US president would formally consult European leaders before his meeting, and said the summit between Trump and Putin filled him with hope and fear.\nBrussels\u2019 top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said: \u201cPresident Trump is right to say that Russia must end its war against Ukraine. The United States has the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously.\u201d But she added: \u201cAny agreement between the United States and Russia must include Ukraine and the EU because it is a security issue for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe.\u201d\nRados\u0142aw Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, also asserted Europe\u2019s relevance, saying: \u201cEurope is paying for Ukraine to defend itself and we are sustaining the Ukrainian state. This is a matter of existential European security interests. We appreciate President Trump\u2019s efforts but we will be taking our own decisions here in Europe. To get to a fair peace, Russia has to limit its war aims.\u201d\nThe White House is insisting that the Alaska meeting is to gauge whether Putin is willing to make concessions for peace, including on accepting western security guarantees for Ukraine, an acceptance that would acknowledge the long-term legitimacy of the Kyiv government led by Zelenskyy.\nMerz spoke with Trump on Sunday night to underline that he would prefer the US to impose further economic sanctions on Moscow before the talks. He also said he assumed Zelenskyy would be involved in any talks, but for Moscow it would be a concession for a Russian delegation to hold talks with the Ukrainian president since its invasion is predicated on not recognising the legitimacy of the government.\nA joint statement on Saturday from the leaders from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Britain, Finland and the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, urged Trump to put more pressure on Russia and stressed: \u201cThe path in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.\u201d\nPutin will go into Friday\u2019s talks believing he is making progress on the battlefield, Trump is desperate for a settlement and the Ukrainian people are also increasingly willing to make concessions for peace. But the Russian president also knows that if he makes no substantive offer, Trump will be under real political pressure to go ahead with long-promised broader economic sanctions against Russia.\nLindsey Graham, the Republican senator behind a congressional plan to impose secondary sanctions on countries that trade with Russia, expressed confidence that Trump would protect Ukraine\u2019s interests at the summit. He was involved in the weekend diplomacy and is trusted as an intermediary with Trump by Ukrainian officials.\nHe said if Putin did not offer concessions, he expected Trump to make countries importing Russian oil pay a heavy price, adding that this applied not just to India but also to China and Brazil. India is already due to face 50% tariffs later this month.\nSpeaking on NBC, Graham said: \u201cMilitarily, we need to keep Ukraine strong, keep flowing them strong and modern weapons, and security guarantees with European forces on the ground as tripwires to prevent a third [Russian] invasion. We want to end this with the sovereign, independent, self-governing Ukraine, and a situation where Putin cannot do this the third time without being crushed.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI want to be honest with you, Ukraine is not going to evict every Russian, and Russia is not going to Kyiv, so there will be some land swaps at the end.\u201d\nUkraine\u2019s leadership has long said that de facto it will not recover all the territory it has lost in successive Russian invasions, but with European support it is fiercely resisting a Russian demand that it should hand over territory in the Donetsk region it has not yet ceded on the battlefield, especially if there are no security guarantees for Ukraine or compensating land swaps by Russia.\nEuropeans are insisting that no limitations can be imposed on Ukraine developing its own military capabilities or the support it receives from third countries, including some inside Nato."

      "text": "Donald Trump has said he is ready to meet Vladimir Putin despite the Russian leader\u2019s refusal to meet Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u2013 dispelling speculation that direct talks between the two warring presidents were a precondition of a high-level US-Russia summit.\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said that Putin did not have to meet with Zelenskyy first before the US and Russian presidents could meet.\n\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey would like to meet with me and I\u2019ll do whatever I can to stop the killing.\u201d\nThat contradicted a New York Post report citing a White House official who said that Trump would only meet Putin if the Kremlin leader met Zelenskyy, something Putin has previously rejected.\nThe mixed messaging \u2013 with White House and Kremlin officials sometimes contradicting each other about the leaders\u2019 demands and the status of the planning \u2013 suggested a chaotic new chapter in Trump\u2019s haphazard efforts to negotiate a ceasefire to the war in Ukraine.\nPutin said he was not ready to meet Zelenskyy, even as the Kremlin claimed preparations were under way for a set-piece bilateral summit with Donald Trump next week.\n\u201cI have nothing against it in general, it is possible, but certain conditions must be created for this,\u201d said Putin of the meeting with Zelenskyy. \u201cBut unfortunately, we are still far from creating such conditions.\u201d\nAfter Putin met Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff in the Kremlin on Wednesday, reports from Washington suggested the Russian president had agreed to meet Trump first and then Zelenskyy in a trilateral format.\nAnd while the Kremlin sounded enthused about the prospect of a set-piece summit, it has denied that the topic of a three-way summit with Zelenskyy was raised.\n\u201cWe propose focusing on preparations for a bilateral meeting with Trump in the first place,\u201d said a Putin aide, Yuri Ushakov, to journalists in Moscow. \u201cAs for a three-way meeting, which for some reason Washington was talking about yesterday, this was just something mentioned by the American side during the meeting in the Kremlin. But this was not discussed. The Russian side left this option completely without comment.\u201d\nNo venue was given for the potential bilateral summit but Putin, who was meeting Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the leader of the United Arab Emirates, in the Kremlin, suggested the UAE could be a suitable place to hold the talks. \u201cWe have many friends who are willing to help us organise such events. One of our friends is the president of the United Arab Emirates,\u201d he said.\nThe prospect of Putin and Trump trying to come to an agreement on Ukraine with no one else in the room is likely to alarm Kyiv and European capitals, who have consistently said that Ukraine must be present for discussions about its fate.\nBy contrast, Russia favours the idea of a \u201cgreat powers summit\u201d at which it could try to negotiate with Trump over the heads of Europeans. Kirill Dmitriev, a Kremlin economic adviser, said the meeting would be a good opportunity to directly talk to Trump to prevent \u201cmisinformation\u201d about Russia that other countries were using to influence the US president. The summit could become \u201can important historic event\u201d, he claimed.\nTrump called Zelenskyy after Witkoff left Russia on Wednesday. The Nato chief, Mark Rutte, and several European leaders were also on the line.\nOn Thursday, Zelenskyy was careful not to criticise Trump but said he would spend the day speaking with European allies. \u201cWe in Ukraine have repeatedly said that the search for real solutions can become truly effective only at the level of leaders. We need to decide on the time for such a format, with a range of issues,\u201d he wrote in a Telegram post.\nLater, he said he had spoken with the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. \u201cI gave [Macron] our Ukrainian view of the talk between President Trump and European colleagues,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are coordinating our positions and we both understand the need for a common European vision of key European security issues.\u201d\nZelenskyy has repeatedly called for direct discussions with Putin, with either Trump or the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, as a mediator. Putin has so far dismissed the possibility, suggesting that lower-level negotiation groups should come to an agreement first. However, little progress has been made at a series of direct talks in Turkey, with Moscow sending a junior delegation and not appearing ready for real talks.\nIn recent weeks, Trump had appeared to take a tougher line with Moscow for the first time in his presidency, calling continued Russian attacks against civilian targets in Ukraine \u201cdisgusting\u201d and promising the introduction of new sanctions if progress towards a deal was not made by a deadline of this Friday.\nWhite House officials have said sanctions were still expected and on Wednesday additional tariffs were announced for India, based on the country\u2019s buying of Russian oil. At the same time, however, Trump seemed satisfied with the outcome of Witkoff\u2019s talks.\nUshakov said the discussions had been \u201cbusinesslike\u201d and claimed they focused on a bright future of cooperation between Washington and Moscow. \u201cIt was reaffirmed that Russian-US relations could be based on a completely different, mutually advantageous scenario, which drastically differs from how they developed in recent years,\u201d he said.\nTrump said on Wednesday evening the meeting could happen \u201cvery soon\u201d. Some others in Washington seemed less sure. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said a meeting could take place soon, \u201cbut obviously a lot has to happen before that can occur\u201d.\nIf it goes ahead, it would be the first US-Russia leaders\u2019 summit since Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva in 2021."

He added, without providing specifics, that Russia was moving its troops for new operations on Ukrainian soil. \u201cThere is no sign that the Russians have received signals to prepare for a postwar situation.\u201d\n-\nSeparately, Zelenskyy said he had spoken to Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday, as he seeks to rally support for Ukraine beyond Europe. Both countries have taken cautious diplomatic positions on the Russian invasion. India is a major buyer of Russian oil and Saudi Arabia has pitched itself as a mediator in the conflict. Zelenskyy said he spoke to both leaders about strengthening Ukraine\u2019s position in any peace process. \u201cCommunication with leaders is ongoing practically around the clock \u2013 we are in constant touch,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cNow is the moment when there is a real chance to achieve peace.\u201d\n-\nTrump said he and Putin would discuss \u201cland swapping\u201d when they met on Friday and expressed frustration with Zelenskyy for putting conditions on such a potential agreement.

It is not clear whether or not Trump has accepted the invitation to the call.\n-\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on Monday that the EU would work on a 19th package of sanctions against Russia and warned against concessions to Moscow. \u201cAs far as Russia has not agreed to full and unconditional ceasefire, we should not even discuss any concessions,\u201d Kallas said in a statement. \u201cThe sequencing of the steps is important. First an unconditional ceasefire with a strong monitoring system and ironclad security guarantees,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cwe will work on a 19th package of sanctions\u201d.\n-\nUkraine has retaken two villages in its eastern region of Sumy, Kyiv\u2019s military said, adding to recent small territorial gains along the border with Russia. Ukraine\u2019s forces liberated the settlements of Stepne and Novokostiantynivka on the Sumy frontline, the general staff said on Tuesday.
