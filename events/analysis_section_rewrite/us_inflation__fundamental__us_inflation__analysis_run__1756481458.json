      "feedback": "The draft is a pure company‑level narrative (EPAM Systems) and therefore drifts from the mandated **SECTION FOCUS** (multi‑year macro structural analysis of macro pillars). Every sentence must be tied to a canonical handle (e.g., spx, ust10y, dxy, gold, etc.) with an explicit causal chain and a dated catalyst window. Remove or rewrite all passages that reference EPAM’s revenue, EPS, or internal restructuring without linking to a macro handle. Replace the company‑centric discussion with a macro view that maps the AI‑driven services trend to a broader **us_inflation** or **us_core_cpi** driver, and link the post‑Ukraine restructuring to **us_fed_policy** or **us_labor_cycle**. Ensure each claim is supported by a source ID (e.g., H86O3XRUJ) and that the text explicitly states the transmission path (e.g., “Higher AI adoption → higher US IT spending → ↑ US GDP growth → ↑ US equity index (spx)”). Drop any mention of EPAM’s share price, earnings, or internal metrics unless they are used to illustrate a macro catalyst. Finally, add a clear catalyst window (e.g., Q3 2025 earnings release, US wage inflation data release in September 2025) and a confidence rating. This will bring the draft into compliance with the macro‑focus, handle mapping, and catalyst requirements.",
