      "feedback": "The draft fails the acceptance gate because “silver” is not a canonical handle (only eurusd, dxy, wti, brent, gold, copper, ust2y, ust10y are allowed). Replace each silver reference with a canonical commodity—e.g., use gold as a proxy for the hedge‑premium logic or drop the theme entirely if silver is the focus. Tighten the probability figures to reflect the explicit sources: use the 89 % Fed‑cut probability from 97MD1FHW8 and the 57 bp steepening from Z7O1DCHS7 to set an 80 % “up” chance, and base the “down” probability on the 11 % chance of a Fed hike (inverse of 89 %) and the CPI‑decline risk from Z7O1DCHS7, yielding a 20 % “down” chance. Ensure each line is a single, concise sentence, with the driver/mechanism, what to watch, and a single probability figure, and keep citations inline (e.g., (97MD1FHW8)(Z7O1DCHS7)). Remove any filler or extra clauses, and verify that the catalyst window (e.g., Fed meeting 16‑17 Aug, core PCE 30 Aug) is explicitly tied to the driver in the same sentence.",
