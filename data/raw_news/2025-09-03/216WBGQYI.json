  "description": "Explore our 1-800Accountant review to learn about its accounting services, pricing, features, and whether it's a good fit for your business needs.",
  "content": "1-800Accountant is a nationwide virtual accounting firm. It offers tech companies end-to-end support across bookkeeping, payroll, tax preparation, and compliance, with access to dedicated accountants, tax advisors, and payroll specialists who understand multistate operations and industry-specific needs. Its online platform and mobile app make it practical for distributed or remote teams, while additional services like entity formation can assist startups during setup.\n\nWhy you can trust my advice\n\nI use a rigorous evaluation framework to assess accounting software, focusing on the needs of tech-driven organizations. As a CPA who\u2019s been reviewing accounting solutions since 2021, I combine hands-on testing with deep industry knowledge to deliver insights grounded in real-world application and not just surface-level research. All comparisons, inferences, and recommendations are valid only within the context of this article and should not be applied more generally.\n\u2022 Need certified bookkeeping support: Work with experienced US-based accountants who categorize transactions and reconcile accounts. Their familiarity with industry-specific and state-specific requirements helps ensure records remain accurate and compliant.\n\u2022 Prefer to focus on operations: Delegate daily bookkeeping tasks to a dedicated accountant. This frees up time to prioritize employees, customers, and business strategy.\n\u2022 Rely on real-time financial data: Access regularly reconciled accounts and categorized transactions that provide timely insight into your company\u2019s financial health. These up-to-date records help you make decisions with accurate information.\n\u2022 Want built-in automation tools: Take advantage of features like automated bank connections, invoicing, receipt uploads, and mileage tracking. These tools reduce manual data entry and streamline ongoing bookkeeping tasks.\n\u2022 Seek full-service tax filing: Get assistance preparing and filing business tax returns, such as Schedule C, 1065, 1120, and 1120S. This ensures compliance with federal and state requirements while minimizing administrative burden.\n\u2022 Require amended returns: Amend past returns with mistakes or missing information by having accountants make corrections and resubmit them. This service helps your business maintain compliance and avoid penalties from inaccurate filings.\n\u2022 Operate across multiple states: Rely on accountants who understand varying state obligations. This expertise helps manage complex compliance needs and reduces risk from inconsistent regulations.\n\nIn my opinion, the Core Accounting plan is the best option. It provides both tax and bookkeeping assistance, covering the essential areas a business needs. If you need only tax help, I recommend the Tax Advisory package since it focuses on tax advice and planning. As a larger business, turn to Enterprise Business because it includes financial reporting, which supports ongoing reporting requirements.\n\nHere are some of the best features that I like about 1-800Accountant. Let\u2019s discuss them in detail below.\n\nI found that 1-800Accountant emphasizes accuracy and consistency in its bookkeeping services. Its certified accountants are responsible for categorizing transactions and reconciling accounts, which helps ensure that business records stay up to date and aligned with state and industry requirements.\n\nIn the use cases above, I also noted that the service incorporates several automation tools to simplify bookkeeping. These include the ability to connect bank accounts for automatic transaction syncing, upload receipts for organized expense tracking, send invoices, and record mileage through the mobile app.\n\n1-800Accountant provides an online client portal that acts as the main hub for communication and account management. I like this feature because it makes communication easy and accessible.\n\nClients log in through the main website using their account email as the username, with first-time users completing setup through a registration link. Once inside, the portal connects directly to bookkeeping and tax services and integrates with the company\u2019s iOS and Android mobile apps, extending usability across devices.\n\nThe portal supports the firm\u2019s virtual service model and enables clients to stay in touch with assigned accountants, schedule appointments, and securely access important documents. By consolidating communication and service management into one system, the portal streamlines how clients interact with their bookkeeping and tax specialists.\n\nIn the event of an IRS audit, 1-800Accountant offers support designed to simplify the process for business owners. The service includes creating an action plan, preparing financial documents, and handling communication with the IRS. Accountants also represent clients directly during the audit, with the stated goal of safeguarding taxpayer rights and ensuring fair treatment throughout the review process.\n\n1-800Accountant offers support for business owners who are just getting started and need help with required setup tasks. One example is obtaining an Employer Identification Number (EIN), which is often necessary for filing taxes, hiring employees, or opening a business bank account. The service simplifies this process by preparing and submitting the necessary IRS forms on behalf of clients, helping new businesses handle initial compliance steps more efficiently.\n\n1-800Accountant positions its tax advisory services as a modern alternative to traditional tax preparation, combining CPA expertise with technology to reduce costs and maintain quality. Clients are paired with tax advisors experienced in their industry and state, with services that include proactive year-round planning, dedicated support, and error prevention to help maximize refunds and minimize tax burdens for both business and complex personal situations.\n\nNot every business will find 1-800Accountant to be the perfect fit. Depending on your priorities \u2014 whether that\u2019s cost, personalization, or software integrations \u2014 other bookkeeping services may be a better match. Here are some alternatives I recommend:\n\nIf you want all-in-one bookkeeping with dedicated monthly support, Bench offers monthly bookkeeping paired with its own software and a dedicated bookkeeper assigned to every client. This model emphasizes personalized communication and faster turnaround for financial statements.\n\nBench may feel like a better fit than 1-800Accountant\u2019s broader team-based approach if you value a more hands-on relationship with your bookkeeper.\n\nMerritt shines because it\u2019s a low-cost, straightforward bookkeeping solution. It keeps its services simple by focusing on core bookkeeping at a flat, transparent monthly rate. It does not bundle payroll, tax preparation, or advisory services, which keeps costs lower than those of full-service firms.\n\nIf you don\u2019t need the year-round tax support or entity formation help that 1-800Accountant provides, Merritt may be the more budget-friendly option.\n\nFor flexible, tech-integrated accounting services, Bookkeeper360 provides bookkeeping, payroll, tax, and advisory options while integrating deeply with QuickBooks and Xero. It supports both cash- and accrual-based accounting and offers month-to-month contracts, giving your company more flexibility as it grows.\n\nBookkeeper360 could be a stronger choice than 1-800Accountant\u2019s more standardized packages if your tech-forward business relies on specific software ecosystems or wants modular service options.\n\nI conducted in-depth research and evaluated each online bookkeeping service in this guide \u2014 comparing features, pricing, and limitations. I also drew on insights from our partners to sharpen my understanding of what makes a strong online bookkeeping provider. With that foundation, I developed use cases tailored to different industries and business needs.\n\nWhat types of businesses does 1-800Accountant serve?\n\n1-800Accountant works with small and midsize US businesses across industries, including self-employed individuals and gig workers. Services are unavailable to non-US businesses.\n\nHow do new clients provide their information?\n\nClients use the online portal to complete questionnaires and upload tax or bookkeeping documents, following the steps outlined in support articles.\n\nHow do I log in to the client portal?\n\nLog in through the homepage using your account email as the username. First-time users complete setup through a registration link, and a password reset option is available if needed.\n\nHow do I contact my accounting team?\n\nMessages can be sent through the portal\u2019s message center. Typical response times are within 1 to 2 business days, although delays may occur during peak tax season.",
