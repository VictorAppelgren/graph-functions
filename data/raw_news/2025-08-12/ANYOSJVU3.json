  "title": "2 Drivers Arrested For DWI In Separate Crashes In Hoboken",
  "description": "Drivers were arrested for DWI after car accidents in Hoboken two days in a row.",
  "content": "On June 28, around 6 p.m., Police Officer Valentino Salgado was on patrol on the 200 block of Willow Avenue when he heard a loud bang, police said. He realized it was a crash and approached two vehicles that were involved. One had heavy damage to the right rear fender, police said. The second vehicle, determined to be the striking vehicle, was located at the intersection of First Street and Willow Avenue, police said.\n\nSalgado said he observed the driver, Bailee Zimmerman, 33, of Jersey City, speaking very slowly, with delayed actions. An on-scene investigation determined that Zimmerman struck a parked vehicle, drove away, and attempted to turn the wrong way down First Street, police said.\n\nPolice gave her a standardized field sobriety test and arrested Zimmerman for driving while intoxicated. At headquarters, she was given summonses for reckless driving and leaving the scene of an accident. As per John\u2019s Law, Zimmerman was released into the custody of a responsible party.\n\nJohn's Law was instituted in New Jersey in 2001 after a man was charged with DWI and then released into the custody of a friend. The friend took him to his vehicle, according to the state. The arrested man then collided with another car, killing the driver, John Elliott, who was an ensign in the Navy.\n\n\n\nEarly the next morning, June 29, around 3:50 a.m., police responded to the 1100 block of Grand Street on reports of a car flipped over. Police said Karol Bacuilima, 29, of Jersey City, was driving at a high rate of speed when she struck a parked vehicle and filpped over.\n\n \"Officers observed the driver to have the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from her breath,\" police said. \"She also appeared to be unsteady on her feet, have glassy eyes, and slurred speech.\" After a field sobriety test was conducted, Bacuilima was arrested for driving while intoxicated. She was also issued summonses for driving while intoxicated, failure to exhibit insurance, reckless driving, and refusal to submit to breath samples.",
