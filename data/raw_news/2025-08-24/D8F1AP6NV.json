  "description": "The Liberty haven\u2019t been at full strength since the second game of the year. It seems like every time they get a star player back, another goes down.",
  "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 When Sandy Brondello pulled the tape to prepare for Saturday\u2019s game against the Dream, it reminded her of the harsh reality of the Liberty\u2019s circumstance this season.\n\n\u201cWhen I go back and watch the last Atlanta game, Nyara [Sabally] started,\u201d Brondello said Saturday. \u201cThere\u2019s no continuity that we can build on.\u201d\n\nBrondello has been around the game of basketball for a long time.\n\nThis is her 13th WNBA season as a head coach.\n\nBut never had she experienced a disadvantageous season quite like this one.\n\nThe Liberty haven\u2019t been at full strength since the second game of the season.\n\nIt seems like every time they get a star player back, another one goes down.\n\nEmma Meesseman, who signed with the team earlier this month, has yet to share the court with Breanna Stewart or Sabally.\n\nFor Saturday\u2019s loss in Atlanta, the Liberty played without two of their starters \u2014 Stewart and Sabrina Ionescu \u2014 and used their 13th different starting lineup.\n\nThe Liberty have been frustratingly inconsistent all season.\n\nBut it\u2019s reflective of the team\u2019s hodgepodge lineups because of all the injuries.\n\nThe frontcourt has taken the most hits.\n\nSabally has missed 22 games, Stewart 13, Jonquel Jones 12 and Isabelle Harrison nine.\n\nThe injuries have strained those who are healthy, and fatigue is widespread.\n\nSome players are playing through the pains of the grueling schedule, including Leonie Fiebich, who injured her right hand July 26 and has played 13 games in 28 days since.\n\nThe Liberty thought things were bad without Jones.\n\nBut Stewart\u2019s absence over the past month has perhaps hurt them even more.\n\nThe Liberty\u2019s defensive rating before her injury was 97.2.\n\nBut since she went down with the bone bruise, the team\u2019s defensive rating ballooned to 106.8, which is the fourth-worst mark in the league since July 26.\n\nStewart is one of the team\u2019s most versatile defenders.\n\nIf Jones is the team\u2019s defensive anchor, Stewart is the rope connecting it.\n\nShe acts on instincts and experience.\n\nShe knows when to help on a drive or cover a roller when another teammate trails behind.\n\nShe makes defense easier for the team.\n\nStewart is also one of the team\u2019s better rebounders, averaging 6.8 boards per game.\n\nAlso, few players get to the free-throw line more than Stewart.\n\nShe attempts six freebies per game, the third-highest average in the league behind A\u2019ja Wilson (7.6) and Kelsey Plum (6.1).\n\nOver the past six games, the Liberty have attempted a league-low 86 free throws.\n\nOpponents have taken 49 more than the Libs, which is the league\u2019s largest discrepancy in that stretch.\n\nA lack of foul discipline because of shoddy defense plays a factor in this, of course.\n\nBut the Libs also aren\u2019t getting enough paint touches or seeking out contact.\n\nThe Liberty \u2014 who started the season with a franchise-best 9-0 run \u2014 no longer have the luxury of trying to wait until everyone is healthy once again.\n\nThey have to start racking up wins or they run the risk of potentially falling even more in the standings.\n\nThe Libs (22-15) hold fifth place in the standings and sit two games behind the second-place Dream (24-13) with only seven games left.\n\nThere\u2019s little-to-no room for error since every one of these games matters in the playoff picture.\n\n\u201cWe just can\u2019t take a break on the injury front, and it\u2019s been frustrating in that regard to not build that continuity,\u201d Brondello said. \u201cWe\u2019re a really good team with our full group but we haven\u2019t been able to show it because everyone has been injured. But hopefully, we\u2019ll get them back and we\u2019ll have the next challenge of seeing how it all works in such a short period of time before the playoffs.\u201d",

  "summary": "The Liberty women's basketball team has been struggling this season, with injuries to key players including Nyara Sabally, Breanna Stewart, Jonquel Jones, Sabrina Ionescu, and Emma Meesseman. The team has played with 13 different starting lines and been inconsistent throughout the season. Sabally has missed 22 games, Stewart 13, Sabally 13, and Isabelle Harrison nine.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21. Terms Pertaining to Certain Third Party Content, Data and Information Providers and Mobile Application Platforms.\n21.1 AP Material. By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications.

We saw a way more connected team.\u201d\nIn the end, though, the same issues persisted with this team.\nThe Liberty were again outrebounded, 42-33.\nThey surrendered 17 offensive boards and the Dream scored 21 second-chance points.\nBeing down two starters is far from ideal.\nBut in Saturday\u2019s game, the fight was missing from the start, as was the urgency the Liberty displayed Tuesday that made Burke so sure this team could be unstoppable.\nBurke\u2019s postgame assessment focused on the team\u2019s porous defense and stop-and-go effort.\n\u201cIt just starts on defense,\u201d said Burke, who had a team-high 13 points and five rebounds. \u201cOnce our defense is great, then offense comes easy for us. So it\u2019s mostly just about effort, giving it for 40 minutes and not doing it for only one half.\u201d\nThere\u2019s hope that reinforcements are on the horizon.\nIonescu avoided what the team considers a \u201cmajor\u201d injury, and Brondello doesn\u2019t anticipate her being out for long.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more about what she can tolerate, so we\u2019ll take it one day at a time,\u201d Brondello said.\nBrondello is also hopeful that Stewart and Harrison will be given the green light to play next week.\nBut their impending returns don\u2019t guarantee this team will \u201cturn on\u201d in an instant.\n\u201cWe all have enough experience, too, to know that it\u2019s not just about flipping a switch,\u201d Meesseman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that you can just turn on from one day to another one.\u201d"

      "text": "ATLANTA \u2014 The Liberty woke up Saturday morning fifth in the WNBA standings with the hopes of capturing a win against the Dream to leapfrog to second.\nBut with a depleted frontcourt and down to only eight players after Sabrina Ionescu was ruled out with a left foot injury three hours before tip-off, the Dream ran away from them and handed the Liberty a 78-62 defeat.\nWith the loss \u2014 their fourth in the last five games \u2014 the Liberty remain in fifth. They sit two games behind Atlanta, who tied the regular-season series 2-2.\nIf the teams \u2014 who are tangled with the Mercury and Aces, too in the standings \u2014 were to finish the regular season with the same record, the tiebreaker would be determined by the team with the better record against .500 or better teams. Each is 12-11 in such games.\nThe next tiebreaker would be head-to-head point differential, which favors the Dream at plus-14.\nAtlanta\u2019s Karl Smesko may only be in his first season as a WNBA head coach, but he\u2019s been a longtime fan of the league.\nHe can\u2019t recall another season during which the competition was as balanced as it is.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who the eighth seed is going to be, but they can win [it all.] They\u2019re that good,\u201d Smesko said. \u201cThese teams can get hot, get on a run. There\u2019s more good teams in the league right now than I can ever remember.\n\u201cWho knows, maybe the best teams just advance. But I would not be surprised if this is just a wild playoffs and things you don\u2019t expect to happen [do happen].\u201d\nThe Aces are an example of a team that\u2019s getting hot at the right time. They entered Saturday riding a nine-game winning streak that has catapulted them into third place, just ahead of the Mercury.\nThe rest of the playoff picture includes the Fever (No. 6), Storm (No. 7) and Valkyries (No. 8), with the Sparks only a half-game behind expansion Golden State for the final postseason spot.\nThe Liberty are starting to feel the pressure in terms of how important each game is.\n\u201cWe have to go into the next [seven] games with a mindset to win every single one of them,\u201d Kennedy Burke said. \u201cSandy [Brondello] mentioned it, how we\u2019re just in a tough spot, but we have to really just stick together and really want to win, basically. You know, just to be in a better seeding.\u201d"

The Liberty have the salary cap space to offer Meesseman, 32, a pro-rated max contract.\nThe Liberty will have to make a roster move to make space for Meesseman after adding Stephanie Talbot earlier Monday as their 12th player.\nTalbot, 31, reportedly signed for the rest of the year after being waived by the Valkyries, reuniting Talbot with her former Mercury coach and current Australian national team coach, Sandy Brondello.\nIn 16 games this season for Golden State, Talbot averaged 3.6 points, 3.3 rebounds and 3.0 assists. She spent 2024 with the Sparks and is a career 35.2 percent shooter from 3-point range in seven WNBA seasons.\nMeesseman, meanwhile, joins the Liberty with a decorated r\u00e9sum\u00e9. She is a two-time WNBA All-Star and won a title with the Washington Mystics in 2019 alongside Natasha Cloud.\nIn her most recent WNBA season in 2022, playing for the Chicago Sky, she averaged 12.4 points (on .571/.342/.887 shooting splits), 5.6 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.4 steals. She\u2019s a skilled playmaker at 6-foot-4 and capable of guarding multiple positions on defense.\nMeesseman also has starred for Belgium on the global stage, helping the national team to a fourth-place finish in last year\u2019s Olympics, in addition to a decorated professional career in Europe, where she previously teamed with Liberty stars Breanna Stewart and Jonquel Jones.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a void to be filled, and that [would] be helpful,\u201d Stewart said earlier this month when asked about Meesseman\u2019s free agency. \u201cI think she should come.\u201d\nThe agreement comes as the Liberty are set to welcome back Jones, their starting center, when they resume play Tuesday.\nJones has been sidelined for more than a month due to a sprained right ankle."

  "argos_summary": "The Washington Liberty are struggling with a string of injuries that have forced them to use 13 different starting lineups, including the loss of Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu, Nyara Sabally and Isabelle Harrison. The team fell 78-62 to the Atlanta Dream, dropping them to fifth place and two games behind the Dream with only eight games left. Coach Sandy Brondello highlighted the lack of continuity and defensive lapses, noting that Stewart\u2019s absence has worsened the team\u2019s defensive rating. The Liberty hope the signing of Emma Meesseman and the return of key players will help stabilize the roster as they fight for playoff positioning.",
