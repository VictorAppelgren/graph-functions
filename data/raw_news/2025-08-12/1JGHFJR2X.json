  "title": "Is Ryobi's Spotlight Any Good? Here's What Users Say",
  "description": "Need to shine a light on your work area? The Ryobi Spotlight promises to be bright enough for any task, but what do owners think about the Ryobi light?",
  "content": "Is Ryobi's Spotlight Any Good? Here's What Users Say\n\nRyobi makes a wide variety of portable lighting solutions that are powered by its 18V One+ batteries. Basic flashlights are great for lightweight utility, and the Ryobi Area Light works great for camping and power outages, but one item in particular that really stands out for those times when you really need long-distance illumination, emergency roadside lighting, or an ultraportable work light: The 18V One+ LED Spotlight. Ryobi isn't always known for producing the most powerful products on the market, but it has a well-earned reputation for offering items that hit above their weight class when it comes to their price-to-performance ratio. Most count it as one of the best power tool brands on the market, though there are some tools that Ryobi has made that users generally feel should be avoided. So before you go running to your local Home Depot to pick one of these lights up for yourself, it might be worth taking the time to look at its specifications and features, and then listening to what previous users have had to say about its real-world performance. That way, you can decide for yourself if the Ryobi Spotlight is right for your needs.\n\nThe Ryobi 18V One+ Spotlight is bright The Ryobi Spotlight is much more than a simple flashlight. The seven LEDs beneath the protective lens generate over 3,000 lumens, making it 25% brighter than the previous generation. For reference, that's more light than you would get from a 150W incandescent bulb. This is concentrated into a beam that is able to reach up to 650 yards of visibility, allowing you to illuminate entire fields with a single 18V device. That's probably more light than you're going to need in most situations, which is why it's also convenient that the Spotlight has high, medium, and low settings so you can adjust the output to suit the situation. You get the full 3,000 lumens on high, 2,000 lumens on medium, and a still fairly bright 1,000 lumens on low. Ryobi also made a few thoughtful considerations in the physical design. The tool itself is designed to be compact at 10 inches tall and weighing just 1.6 lbs. This makes it fairly easy to carry, but the Spotlight is also designed to be easy to position when you want to set it down. You can stand it up on the battery at the base, lay it down on either side, and even set it down on its back with the light facing up, all while providing stable, functional, and conveniently angled light. The Spotlight also has a hanging loop that makes it easier to store when it's not in use. You can get it from the Ryobi website or Home Depot for $49.97. Purchasing the 18V One+ Spotlight from one of these official retailers also gets you Ryobi's 3-year limited warranty.\n\nCustomers and critics love the Ryobi 18V One+ Spotlight The specs and features listed by the manufacturer are good to know, but it's just as important to see what previous owners and professional critics think of the Ryobi 18V One+ Spotlight. Fortunately, the general consensus seems very positive. The Spotlight has a 4.9 out of 5 stars on Ryobi's website with 412 reviews. It has another 4.9 out of 5 on Home Depot with 1,054 reviews (99% of which stated that they would recommend the light to other buyers). In fact, this impressive score ranks it among the best-rated Ryobi Tools you can get at Home Depot. Finally, it has a 4.8 out of 5 on Amazon with 160 global reviews. Users generally appear to like the Spotlight for its brightness, battery life, weight, ergonomics, overall build quality, and impressive value. It's not just consumers who seem to like the light, either. Professional reviewers seem generally impressed by it as well. Jeff Crisp of Pro Tool Reviews gave the light an 8.3 out of 10, citing light output, value, and build quality as its biggest strengths while knocking it down a few points for its modest run time and limited feature set. Others, like YouTube reviewer Charles Artificer, were impressed by how far the beam of light is thrown.",

      "text": "How Well Does Ryobi's Area Light Lantern Work? Here's What The User Reviews Say\nWith more than 300 products currently in its lineup, pro builders and DIYers looking for cordless tools to tackle tough jobs on the home front or the work site will likely find what they need in Ryobi's various One+ lineup. The Japanese tool manufacturer has bolstered the versatility of that lineup by ensuring each of the devices there-in can be powered by the same, shareable 18v Lithium Ion battery packs. To the delight of many Ryobi devotees who tackle their tasks in low-light areas, the One+ lineup now features a few handy, battery-powered area lights and accessories.\nDesigned to bring rays of light to any darkened area you find yourself working in, Ryobi's easy-to-carry and easy-to-hang LED Area Light is one of several lighting options available in the One+ lineup. At 850 Lumens, it's also one of the brightest lanterns in Ryobi's lineup, a fact that makes it as ideal for tackling jobs in darkened attics and basements as it is for illuminating a campsite. Giving its lighting output alone, Ryobi's 850 Lumen lantern has become the lighting source of choice for the many One+ users who've actively sought it out via the company's online storefront or through its exclusive retailer, The Home Depot.\nIf you're interested in adding one of these lanterns to your One+ arsenal, reading a few first-hand accounts from real-world users might prove helpful in determining if the lantern will suit your needs. Here's a look what some customers are saying about Ryobi's Area Light Lantern.\nUsers are generally satisfied with the performance of Ryobi's Area Lantern\nIf you are looking for first-hand accounts about Ryobi's 850 Lumen Area Light Lantern, you'll find plenty scattered between Ryobi's online store, as well as that of The Home Depot, with the sites boasting almost 800 customer reviews between them. The bulk of those reviews are positive, with the lantern holding a 4.9 out of 5-star rating at each of those points of purchase.\nFor those who are only interested in the numbers, a pair of 4.9 ratings may be enough to seal the proverbial deal when it comes to whether or not the Ryobi area lantern is worth the price. However, those looking for practical data might be more curious what customers are actually saying. As for the reviews, several of the 5-star reviews posted on Ryobi's site and those at The Home Depot page didn't even use the light on a worksite, with many instead claiming the lantern was incredibly handy during a power outage, particularly as the light's USB connecter allows for the charging of mobile devices.\nWithout getting too detailed, we can confirm that many reviewers who awarded the light 4 or 5 stars speak quite glowingly about its capabilities on the work site. However, there is a minority who've had issues, with one reviewer bemoaning the fact that the light is not water-resistant. Other less-than-positive reviews reported the light drains batteries too quickly, as the lanterns appear to draw current even when powered off. Still others complained that the USB port may also be quick to malfunction. So, you'll want to take those factors into consideration before you buy."

      "text": "How Long Is Ryobi's Warranty?\nRyobi power tools have become incredibly innovative, but like with most forms of technology, there is always bound to be a hiccup in the manufacturing process. Luckily, Ryobi understands this and takes care of its customers with fairly generous warranties for each product the company sells.\nRegarding timing, the only Ryobi tools and products with a limited lifetime warranty are the non-powered hand tools and the LINK modular storage system due to them not having any type of motor function attached to them. The chances of manufacturer error and workmanship issues are slimmer, so Ryobi can offer such a lengthy warranty.\nOn the other hand, tools functioned by motors and batteries tend to have a shelf life \u2014 albeit an exceptionally long one. For the other tools that the company sells, there are different factors that are in play for warranties. Luckily, the information is easy to find if you misplaced the warranty information when you bought the tool. Additionally, if you register your Ryobi tools, submitting a warranty claim will be a straightforward process.\nWhat your Ryobi warranty covers\nRyobi warranty time limits are based on the product category and some of them go further and determine a time limit based on how it is being used. First off, the more common power tools, like the 18V ONE+ and 40V lines (which include outdoor equipment, drills, fans, and more), corded power tools, and pneumatic tools, all come with a three-year limited warranty and a 90-day exchange policy. However, be aware that the USB 4V power tools have a two-year limited warranty with a 90-day exchange policy.\nOutdoor equipment and generators are where the warranties start to get a bit different. Essentially, the timing of the warranty is based on where you actively use the equipment. For example, the 80V zero-turn mowers have a five-year warranty if used for personal, family, or household use. However, if it is used for commercial, rental, or any other income-producing purpose, then the allowed warranty time goes down considerably and is also based on deck size \u2014 250 use hours for deck sizes under 42 inches and 500 use hours for deck sizes 42 inches or larger. Additionally, walk-behind mowers only get a one-year warranty if used for commercial use.\nGenerators work the same way. There are three different categories for generator warranties: 18V ONE+, 40V, and gas. The 18V ONE+ and the gas generators have three-year limited warranties, whereas the 40V generator has a five-year warranty \u2014 these warranty limits are for personal use. However, if any of them are used for commercial use or rental, then the warranty drops down considerably to 90 days.\nWhat does limited mean when it comes to Ryobi's limited warranty?\nYou've probably noticed that each warranty mentioned above always includes the term \"limited.\" This means that there are very specific regulations that need to be followed for your hand tools, power tools, generators, or other pieces of Ryobi equipment to get either fixed or replaced by the manufacturer.\nOne limitation is that if the tool has a defect that arises from misuse, abuse, or neglect of the tool, then it will not fall under the warranty. This means you need to properly maintain your Ryobi power tools for long-lasting performance and any future mishaps due to workmanship issues. Additionally, if the tool does break, you are not to modify or repair it yourself. If you turn the tool in for repair and a Ryobi authorized service department notices any alterations, they have the right to make your warranty invalid.\nAnother limitation is that you must be the original purchaser of the tool. This means that if you risk buying a used tool from Facebook Marketplace or from a friend, then the warranty will not pertain to you, even if it is technically in the allowed time of the warranty if there is a manufacturing defect. With that said, you do have the option of purchasing a factory-reconditioned power tool from places like Direct Tools. The tools tend to run cheaper since they've been used, and you still get a one-year reconditioned warranty. Just keep your receipt as proof of purchase because the original purchaser limitation still applies."

      "text": "While many people consider Ryobi tools to be solidly in the DIYer category, the company has consistently cranked out high-quality, affordably priced tools that are right at home in a Pro\u2019s toolbox. In fact, many of the tools in my trailer are Ryobi, including the rotary hammer drill I recently reviewed. Now Ryobi\u2019s added to its suite of lighting products with the Ryobi 18V One+ Dual Power LED Spotlight. I don\u2019t often have to work in the dark, but I went out looking for a reason to do so.\nFirst Impressions\nThe \u201cdual power\u201d in the name comes from spotlight\u2019s ability to be powered by Ryobi\u2019s 18V One+ battery or the included 12V automotive cord. The 12V cord plugs into the bottom of the light, so you\u2019ll have to remove the battery to use it. The tool doesn\u2019t come with an 18V battery (it\u2019s bare), so it looks like Ryobi is catering more to those already on the 18V One+ platform instead of trying to lure in new customers. Although it would add to the price, that might a missed opportunity given some of the stellar reviews I\u2019ve already read about it. We\u2019ll see.\nSeven 3-watt CREE LEDs produce up to 2,500 lumens and what Ryobi claims is a 700-yard beam distance. Two light output levels, as well as off, are controlled with the successive trigger that locks on so it doesn\u2019t have to be held. You can see a big heat sink through the large cooling grates. This is a necessity because a spotlight this size absolutely must have a way for the heat to dissipate quickly, even with an LED light source.\nThe spotlight\u2019s handle has the same comfortable grip overmold that I like on the rotary hammer drill. There\u2019s also a top handle that can serve as a tether or hanging hook built into the tool body. With a little creativity, it\u2019s a handy feature for a variety of hanging options. The easiest is to simply tie a string around it for hanging on a nail or screw.\nAt 1.55 pounds without the battery, it\u2019s light. Ryobi\u2019s Xenon spotlight tips the scales at 2.5 pounds. If you\u2019ve used that model, you\u2019ll certainly like the Ryobi P717\u2019s weight. But let\u2019s get to work and see if it\u2019s an illuminating experience.\nRead our review of Ryobi\u2019s 1700-lumen Hybrid Work Light for a flood light option!\nShine On\nThis light is just impressively bright. It\u2019s immediately clear why they call it a spotlight instead of just a flashlight. The beam is wide and long. Even in the bright daylight, you can stand several feet away from an object outside and see the beam on high. Aside from the fact that there are seven LED chips instead of four, it\u2019s very similar to the light output of Ridgid\u2019s Light Cannon.\nI used the Ryobi 18V One+ Dual Power LED Spotlight to illuminate an attic and it\u2019s all the light I needed. I didn\u2019t even need to move it around \u2013 it simply lit the entire space up with reflected light. Both beam levels work well, though you only likely need low for inside jobs.\nOther Considerations\nBalance is excellent \u2013 it stands up sturdily on its battery base, and that weight down balance works well in hand. As I mentioned, it\u2019s very light. As a spotlight that\u2019s meant to be held, Ryobi did a nice job with the heat dissipation to keep the user comfortable during extended use.\nYou might initially wonder why you have to remove the battery to plug in the automotive cord. After all, it seems a little inconvenient since you\u2019d rather just keep the battery attached for charging or to simply stand on its own. But it\u2019s really a safety feature that keeps this spotlight in the featherweight division and the price so affordable. If you could use the 18V battery and 12V plug simultaneously, the spotlight would require circuit protection that would add weight along with a price jump.\nThe only downside is that it\u2019s not freestanding when powered by the 12V plug \u2013 it must lay down or be propped somehow. That is unless you\u2019re holding it out your car window on some kind of patrol. While I\u2019d discourage you from impersonating a police officer, it\u2019s handy for a drive by security sweep of your jobsite.\nI didn\u2019t run the spotlight until the battery died, but Ryobi says you\u2019ll get 5 hours on low using a 4Ah battery. That will give you enough time to work one-off jobs outside on high or a decent project inside on low. Compared to its Ridgid cousin getting 30 hours on low and more than 4 hours on high, runtime is fairly short.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe Ryobi 18V One+ Dual Power LED Spotlight is a featherweight light at 1.55 pounds and produces an impressive 2,500-lumen beam with seven 3-watt CREE LEDs powered by either a Ryobi 18V One+ battery (not included) or a 12V automotive cord (included).\nIt has high and low (and of course, off) settings which are toggled by a successive trigger with a lock-on. It has a large heat sink and plastic grate area to dissipate heat quickly. The overmold grip is comfortable and similar to other recent Ryobi products.\nThe light can be freestanding on the 18V battery or hung by the top handle that\u2019s part of the tool body with a little creative thinking. If you\u2019re not holding or hanging the light while powering it via the 12V adapter, you\u2019ll have to lay it on its side or prop it up somehow. This is really the only awkward part of this otherwise stellar light.\nBut keep in mind that having to remove the battery to plug in the 12V automotive cord is a safety feature that keeps the weight and price down. If you could plug in the 12V cord while the battery was inserted, the Ryobi 18V One+ Dual Power LED Spotlight would need circuit protection that would add to the price and weight.\nOverall, I\u2019m very happy with the design. At $49 it\u2019s really a steal if you\u2019re already on Ryobi\u2019s 18V One+ platform but even if you\u2019re not, it\u2019s another one in a line of recent tools that will make you consider jumping on board!\nFor smaller areas, check out our review of Ryobi\u2019s LED Workbench Light!\nRyobi 18V One+ Dual Power LED Spotlight Features\n- Over 2,500-Lumens of light\n- 700 yds. of beam distance\n- Seven 3-Watt CREE LEDs for superior light output\n- Up to 5 hours of runtime with Ryobi P108 4Ah battery\n- Dual powered\n- Includes: 12-Volt automotive cord, operators manual\nRyobi 18V One+ Dual Power LED Spotlight Specifications\n- Model number: Ryobi P717\n- Depth: 7-inches\n- Width: 4.25-inches\n- Height: 8.25-inches\n- Batteries included: no\n- Product weight: 1.5-pounds\n- Certifications: 1-UL listed\n- Warranty: 3-year\n- Price: $49 (bare) at The Home Depot"
