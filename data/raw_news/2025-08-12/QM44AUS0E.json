  "content": "Shares in Norma Group jumped after the German machine-parts maker confirmed its full-year guidance and said profitability improved significantly in the second quarter after a weak start to the year.\n\nIn morning European trade, shares were up 11% at 17.6 euros. The shares are up 42% over the past three months and 12% over the past year.\n\nNorma said Tuesday that it continues to expect full-year sales of around 1.1 billion to 1.2 billion euros ($1.28 billion-$1.39 billion), with an adjusted earnings before interest and taxes margin of around 6% to around 8%. Meanwhile, net operating cash flow is expected at between 75 million and 95 million euros.\n\nThe company said that after a weak first-quarter, profitability improved despite the challenging macroeconomic environment weakening sales. Its improved performance was due to strict cost discipline and the company said it expects demand to moderately recover over the coming months.\n\nFor the second quarter, sales were down 5.2% on year to 290.4 million euros. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes fell 10% to 23.4 million euros while its adjusted EBIT margin fell to 8.1% from 8.5% last year, but rose significantly on the 3.6% it reported in the first quarter, the company said.",
