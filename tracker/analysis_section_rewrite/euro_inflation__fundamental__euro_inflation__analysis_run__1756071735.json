      "feedback": "Strong data-grounding and a coherent multi‑source pull are evident, but to reach world‑class quality you need a tighter, first‑principles regime framework, sharper causal chains to market pricing, and explicit, testable catalysts/invalidation. Actionable edits (consolidated into one paragraph): first, replace the current narrative with a formal, multi‑year regime map anchored in invariants (real rate differentials, terms of trade/BoP, productivity from AI, policy reaction functions) and clearly defined regimes (e.g., Regime A: AI-enabled productivity growth with policy stability; Regime B: policy shocks that lift discount rates and risk premia; Regime C: labor/commodity supply shocks that tighten inputs/prices). For each regime, specify transition conditions and thresholds (e.g., a sustained real‑rate surprise of Δr or a tariff/Grant‑freeze escalation lasting >6–12 months) and derive the causal chain: AI progress improves TFP and firm value but only if steerability/customization drives adoption (cite R3WNA7L7A); policy/political risk raises discount rates and dampens capex (cite URA82RR2I and YQP2U687I where relevant); labor and commodity shocks alter input costs and supply constraints (cite URA82RR2I’s CA labor drop and almond losses). Quantify these links with concrete numbers from the sources where possible (e.g., CA private‑sector employment −3.1%; 32 rats/night; $109–$311m losses in almonds; UCLA grant suspensions ~$584m; Paramount settlement $16m) and map them to price/risk pathways (equities, credits, commodities) to show how each channel feeds into risk premia. Strengthen the medium/long‑horizon scenario by adding explicit best/bear cases with probabilities and an invalidation rule (e.g., if AI steerability fails to reach a measurable productivity uplift within 3–5 years, or if policy shocks exceed a threshold that crowds out private investment). Broaden coverage to all critical inputs by consistently citing R3WNA7L7A, URA82RR2I, and YQP2U687I for each thread (AI, labor/agriculture, and culture/branding/governance effects respectively) and reconcile potential tensions between them (e.g., AI gains vs. public‑policy backlash, or almond‑sector costs vs. broader California GDP dynamics). Finally, tighten formatting to deliver: Base case, Key risks, What to watch, and Confidence, with a compact, numbered chain of causality and explicit, source‑anchored metrics at each step.",
