      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid high‑level snapshot but it falls short of a world‑class scenario analysis. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly linking macro drivers (Fed stance, CPI, semiconductor supply) to each sector’s cost structure and cash‑flow profile, and quantify the impact (e.g., a 25 bp Fed hike → +0.3 % margin compression for UAS, +0.5 % yield squeeze for dividend stocks). Replace vague “path‑dependent” language with concrete trigger windows (e.g., UAS certification approvals in Q2–Q3 2025, Toyota’s 2026 hybrid‑only launch in Q4 2025). For each catalyst, list a clear invalidation scenario (e.g., tariff spike > 5 % erodes Inghams’ feed‑conversion margin). Add a numeric base‑case valuation (e.g., UAS employment growth 3.5 % CAGR, dividend yield drift 0.1 pp). Cite specific sources: use the 97 % UAS job rise from FOM34PUWA, Abbott’s 53‑yr dividend streak and 1.8 % yield from WISLWAJ15, Inghams’ 60 % customer concentration from GUJQZY4UO, and Toyota’s 475,193 units sold in 2024 from H8880U45S. Ensure every claim is backed by an ID (e.g., “FOM34PUWA” for UAS jobs, “WISLWAJ15” for dividend yields). Finally, structure the analysis into a clear base case, 1–2 alternative scenarios (e.g., Fed hawk vs dovish), and a risk/validation matrix with watch‑list signals. This will elevate depth, coherence, and actionable insight.",
