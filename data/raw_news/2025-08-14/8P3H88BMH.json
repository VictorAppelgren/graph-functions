  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None GAAP revenue jumped 413% year over year to $11.8 million in Q2 2025, but fell far short of analyst estimates, with GAAP revenue of $11.8 million missing the consensus of $23.2 million by 49.0%.\n\u2022 None Research and development costs and SG&A expenses (GAAP) dropped sharply, reflecting strict cost management as Invivyd eyes late-stage product approvals.\n\u2022 These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nInvivyd (NASDAQ:IVVD), a biotech firm focused on antibodies for infectious diseases, reported earnings for Q2 2025 on August 14, 2025. The company reported a sharp increase in GAAP revenue year over year, with net product revenue of $11.8 million compared to $2.3 million in Q2 2024, mainly from its COVID-19 monoclonal antibody PEMGARDA. However, GAAP revenue of $11.8 million undershot analyst expectations of $23.16 million by nearly half. The reported net loss per share was $(0.12) (GAAP). Despite substantial drops in research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs (GAAP), continued net losses and a shrinking cash position reflect the firm remains in investment mode. The quarter marked significant pipeline and regulatory advances.\n\nAbout Invivyd and Its Business Model\n\nInvivyd develops monoclonal antibody (mAb) medicines to prevent and treat infectious diseases, with a primary focus on COVID-19 and related viral threats. Its lead product, PEMGARDA, is an antibody authorized as a preventive therapy for COVID-19 in immunocompromised individuals under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) pathway. This population includes those who do not mount a strong response to vaccination, representing millions of at-risk patients in the U.S.\n\nThe firm\u2019s main priorities include gaining full regulatory approvals, expanding its product pipeline to other viruses like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and measles, and improving market traction among target healthcare providers. Success rests on effective commercialization of its lead product and maintaining regulatory alignment for evolving COVID-19 strains.\n\nNet product revenue soared 413% year-over-year, reflecting a ramp-up in sales of PEMGARDA, its COVID-19 mAb. However, the GAAP revenue figure was nearly 49.0% below analyst estimates. Management noted particularly modest demand growth, despite the medication now being added to leading oncology guidelines for B-cell lymphomas. The company\u2019s in-house sales force, reorganized during the previous quarter, began to make headway late in the period, but the disruption from shifting away from a contracted model likely impacted momentum.\n\nR&D expenditures (GAAP) plunged 68.4% compared to Q2 2024, mainly due to reduced manufacturing and lower spending on late-stage clinical trials. Total net loss (GAAP) improved significantly, narrowing from $47.2 million in Q2 2024 to $14.7 million. Still, the company missed its prior goal of reaching profitability by the first half of 2025. Management cited slower commercial traction and expense reduction as temporary levers while still chasing top-line growth.\n\nPipeline progress was a highlight of the quarter. VYD2311, a next-generation mAb for COVID-19, advanced toward a pivotal clinical trial. Invivyd announced \u201calignment with the U.S. FDA on a rapid pathway to full approval\u201d for VYD2311, pursuing broad indications that include adults and adolescents. Trial data showed an extended half-life of up to 76.0 days by intramuscular injection for VYD2311, based on Phase 1/2 results announced in June 2025, reinforcing the candidate\u2019s potential as a long-acting preventive option. The company also initiated new discovery programs for RSV and measles mAbs, with data updates for these research efforts scheduled for later in 2025.\n\nOn the regulatory side, PEMGARDA remains available on an emergency basis only. The product is not yet fully approved and is reserved for people with moderate-to-severe immune compromise. In February 2025, the FDA declined Invivyd\u2019s request to expand PEMGARDA\u2019s use into treatment (not just prevention), but did provide scientific feedback that may benefit newer mAb candidates. Inventory levels remained steady at $25.4 million (GAAP). Additionally, Invivyd secured a $30 million term loan facility to boost its balance sheet.\n\nPEMGARDA, Invivyd\u2019s only product generating meaningful revenue, is a monoclonal antibody given to patients who are at high risk of severe COVID-19 due to weakened immune systems. Most sales growth came from increased outreach to specialists and expanded availability at healthcare sites. Professional society recognition, including inclusion in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical guidelines, supports longer-term adoption efforts. However, commercial execution remains challenged by slow market education and provider hesitancy.\n\nVYD2311, which is still in early clinical stages, is a next-generation monoclonal antibody engineered to have higher potency and a longer half-life compared to PEMGARDA. Recent data showed no severe adverse events and promise for convenient intramuscular administration. The U.S. FDA has agreed to a rapid licensing path, which could hasten commercial launch if further trials succeed. If approved, VYD2311 is expected to broaden Invivyd\u2019s reach beyond the immunocompromised population, potentially including the wider adult and adolescent communities.\n\nBeyond COVID-19, Invivyd is now investing in exploratory mAb programs for respiratory syncytial virus and measles. These efforts are at the preclinical or discovery stage, but updates on their progress are expected during the second half of 2025. Additionally, the company formed a study group to investigate mAb therapy for long COVID and COVID-19 post-vaccination syndromes, aiming to capture emerging demand outside current standard-of-care treatments.\n\nThe company\u2019s regulatory positioning, particularly the continued dependence on EUA status for PEMGARDA, implies a degree of business risk. Any regulatory changes or the rise of new COVID-19 strains less sensitive to current therapies could sharply affect revenue, even as cost cuts have bought additional time for future milestones.\n\nOutlook and What to Watch\n\nManagement did not provide precise financial guidance for the third quarter or full fiscal 2025. Leadership reiterated its ambition for near-term profitability as respiratory virus season approaches, but described this as aspirational and dependent on stronger sales performance. Recent financing through a term loan facility offers some balance sheet support, though continued losses may require further capital or improved pipeline delivery.\n\nInvestors should monitor several key areas in upcoming quarters: the pace of PEMGARDA adoption as respiratory virus activity picks up; and updates on RSV and measles antibody programs.\n\nRevenue and net income presented using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) unless otherwise noted.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."
