  "description": "The very attributes that make family offices effective\u2014streamlined operations and significant financial assets\u2014also render them attractive targets for cyber threats.",
  "content": "ISACA Board of Directors and Chief Information Security Officer at Crypto.com, overseeing the company's global cybersecurity and strategy.\n\nFamily offices, the private wealth management firms serving high-net-worth families, have seen significant growth in recent years, particularly in Asia. This expansion, while beneficial, also exposes them to increased cyber threats, necessitating a reevaluation of their digital security measures.\n\nAs cybercriminals become more sophisticated, family offices must remain vigilant, implementing proactive cybersecurity measures not just for their assets but also for their family members.\n\nThe Rise Of Family Offices In Asia\n\nFamily offices manage assets starting from $100 million, with many overseeing portfolios exceeding $1 billion. Some estimates project that the total value of their assets under management by family offices may surpass hedge funds in the coming years.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region has demonstrated remarkable growth in this space. A 2023 report by Raffles Family Office and Campden Wealth highlighted that 58% of family offices in Asia reported an increase in assets under management (AUM), with 32% experiencing growth exceeding 10%. This upward trajectory is further evidenced by the substantial wealth they control: Collectively, participating families in a recent study possessed a combined wealth of $68 billion.\n\nHong Kong, in particular, is experiencing a significant surge in family office establishments. The city anticipates a 43% increase in family offices by the end of 2025, driven by new government measures designed to attract ultra-high-net-worth individuals. Since 2021, InvestHK, the city's official investment promotion body, has facilitated the establishment of 140 family offices and expects this number to reach 200 this year.\n\nWhy Family Offices Are Prime Targets For Cybercriminals\n\nThe very attributes that make family offices effective\u2014personalized service, streamlined operations and significant financial assets\u2014also render them attractive targets for cyber threats:\n\u2022 Concentration Of Wealth: Managing vast sums, family offices present lucrative opportunities for cybercriminals seeking financial gain.\n\u2022 Sensitive Information: Beyond financial data, these entities hold personal details, investment strategies and confidential communications, all of which are valuable on the black market.\n\u2022 Perceived Vulnerability: Many family offices operate with lean teams and may lack robust cybersecurity infrastructures, making them appear as low-hanging fruit to attackers.\n\nAlarmingly, a Deloitte survey revealed that 43% of family offices experienced a cyberattack within a recent 12-to-24-month period, with 25% facing three or more attacks. Regionally, North America reported the highest incidence at 57%, followed by Europe at 41% and Asia Pacific at 24%.\n\nThe Rising Threat Of Deepfakes And Social Engineering Attacks\n\nFamily offices must not only protect their assets but also ensure that family members practice robust cyber hygiene. A growing and alarming cyber threat is the use of deepfake technology in social engineering scams.\n\nDeepfakes\u2014AI-generated audio or video recordings that mimic real individuals\u2014are becoming powerful tools for cybercriminals. Attackers can convincingly impersonate family members or trusted associates, leading to fraudulent financial transactions.\n\nFor instance, a man in Hong Kong was scammed out of $622,000 after cybercriminals used deepfake voice technology to impersonate his friend, asking for an emergency financial transfer. Similar attacks have targeted CEOs and financial leaders globally.\n\nTo combat this rising threat, family offices and their members must establish strong verification protocols, such as:\n\u2022 Secret Passphrases: Agree on a confidential passphrase or code word known only to family members. In situations where a request seems unusual or urgent, asking for this passphrase can help verify the individual's identity.\n\u2022 Multi-Channel Verification: If you receive a suspicious message or call, verify its authenticity through a different communication channel. For example, if you get an email requesting funds, confirm via a phone call or in-person conversation.\n\nWith the rapid evolution of AI-driven fraud, vigilance is no longer optional\u2014it\u2019s essential.\n\nIn their quest for diversification and higher returns, many family offices are venturing into the world of digital assets. While these assets offer enticing opportunities, they also introduce a host of unfamiliar risks that many family offices may not be prepared for, including:\n\u2022 Secure Storage: Unlike traditional assets, digital assets require secure digital storage solutions. Inadequate storage practices can lead to theft or loss.\n\u2022 Private Key Management: The security of digital assets hinges on private keys. Mismanagement or loss of these keys can result in irreversible asset loss.\n\u2022 Physical Security: Key-person risks and kidnapping have been a growing trend to be cautious of, and require proper planning.\n\u2022 Self-Management Challenges: Manually handling digital assets without expert guidance can expose family offices to operational risks and potential fraud. Consider institutional custody solutions with trusted digital asset platforms.\n\u2022 Authentication Measures: Implementing multifactor authentication (MFA) is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and bolster security, and improve cyber-hygiene by securing passwords in trusted password manager applications, and also using a passkey for additional security.\n\nThe decentralized and often opaque nature of digital assets markets further complicates risk management, making it imperative for family offices to develop comprehensive security strategies tailored to digital assets.\n\nThe old rhetoric was, \"It's not if a cyberattack will occur, but when.\" The harsh reality is that it is already happening and you are not aware. For family offices, the stakes are exceptionally high, encompassing financial loss, reputational damage and erosion of client trust.\n\nTo navigate this treacherous landscape, cyber resilience must be a core priority. This means:\n\u2022 Appointing cybersecurity advisors or experts on the board to provide oversight and strategic direction\n\u2022 Gaining clarity on infrastructure exposure by leveraging bug bounty programs, where trusted ethical hackers help uncover and report vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them.\n\nFamily offices today manage more than just wealth\u2014they safeguard a legacy. Protecting that legacy requires a proactive approach to cybersecurity, ensuring that both assets and the families behind them remain secure and resilient.\n\nAs cyber risks continue to evolve, family offices must take immediate action to enhance their digital security. Cybercriminals are no longer just targeting banks and corporations; they are actively exploiting the vulnerabilities of family offices and high-net-worth individuals.\n\nRemember, the above are just very high-level examples of just a few security best practices you should enforce; there are a lot more. If your family office is seeking to enhance its cyber resilience and protect its valuable assets, consider consulting with experts who specialize in cybersecurity solutions tailored to high-net-worth entities. The risks are clear, but with the right strategies in place, so is the path to protection.\n\nis an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.",

      "text": "Corporate executives are facing a rise in impersonation-based cyberattacks aimed at gaining access to their home networks and putting them and their families at risk of personal harm, security researchers and other experts warn.\nThe increase in threat activity is connected to the growing sophistication of voice-cloning and deepfake technology, which allows attackers to send out fake videos and messages claiming to be from trusted contacts, such as senior executives at the targets\u2019 companies. After breaching their targets, the attackers use their privileged access to further dupe the victims\u2019 colleagues and engage in corporate espionage or extortion.\nThe rise in impersonation attacks against executives comes as the fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in 2024 heightens business leaders\u2019 fears for their personal safety and that of their families.\nIn a Ponemon Institute survey sponsored by BlackCloak, a security firm specializing in digital protection, slightly more than half of security professionals said hackers personally targeted an executive at their organization this year, up from 43% two years ago.\nApproximately 40% respondents said an executive was targeted in a deepfake attack this year, up from about one-third in 2023. The study shows that the impersonation of trusted contacts is a common attack vector, with hackers requesting payments or confidential information under the guise of a security incident.\n\u201cAs AI technology advances, attackers are shifting their focus from technical exploits to human emotions using deeply personal and well-orchestrated social engineering tactics,\u201d Chris Pierson, founder and CEO of BlackCloak, said via email.\nHackers are increasingly creating fake video or audio files of executives or their family members and using those techniques to steal money or trick targets into releasing sensitive data or taking other actions that could compromise their company, Pierson said.\nAttackers are also stepping up their targeting of executives\u2019 home networks, as many business leaders either work remotely or frequently access their corporate networks from home.\n\u201cWhen we look at the intelligence landscape involving the protection of high-net-worth individuals, protecting them, their families and their assets is challenging to say the least,\u201d Anthony Carter, senior adviser at the corporate advisory firm AlphaMile, said at a May 15 conference sponsored by the Digital Evolution Institute.\nForty-one percent of the 5.5 million high-net-worth individuals in the U.S. reported being the victim of a digital or physical crime, Carter said.\nCyberattacks on executives have grown in the aftermath of Thompson\u2019s killing, according to security firm Flashpoint. In April, researchers identified a website called \u201cLuigi was right\u201d that contained detailed personal and business information about executives at roughly 1,000 companies.\nThe site appeared to go offline on May 29, but a new site called the CEO Database appeared later that same day. That website contained even more information, including phone numbers and LinkedIn account information.\nAttackers likely developed the websites to cultivate support and interest in the ongoing anti-executive movement in the U.S., Flashpoint researchers told Cybersecurity Dive. And given their wealth of data, the sites could help hackers acquire additional information about these executives.\n\u201cBased on the likelihood that personal contact information was present on these websites, threat actors could use the provided information to conduct additional searches on open source platforms or paid data aggregator sites and potentially gain access to additional PII such as residential addresses,\u201d said the researchers, who asked not to be identified due to safety concerns associated with their work."

      "text": "A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\nFamily offices are expected to add more than $2 trillion in assets by 2030, as an increase in wealth concentration and a revolution in wealth management drive rapid growth in new family offices.\nThe number of single-family offices \u2014 the in-house investment and service firms of families typically worth $100 million or more \u2014 is expected to rise from 8,000 to 10,720 by 2030, according to a report from Deloitte Private. Their assets are expected to grow even faster, topping $5.4 trillion by 2030, up from $3.1 trillion today and more than doubling since 2019.\nIn total, the wealth of families with family offices is expected to top $9.5 trillion in 2030, according to the report \u2014 more than doubling over the decade.\n\"The growth has been explosive,\" said Rebecca Gooch, global head of insights for Deloitte Private. \"It's really the past decade that has seen an acceleration in growth in family offices.\"\nThe rise of family offices is remaking the wealth management industry and creating a powerful new force in the financial landscape. Projected to have more assets than hedge funds in the coming years, family offices have become the new stars of fundraising, with venture capital firms, private equity interests and private companies all competing to capture a slice of their rising wealth.\nThe growth is being driven by two broader economic forces. Increasingly, wealth is growing fastest at the top of the pyramid, as technology and globalization create winner-take-all markets and outsized rewards for tech entrepreneurs. The number of Americans worth $30 million or more grew 7.5% in 2023, to 90,700, while their fortunes surged to $7.4 trillion, according to CapGemini.\nThe population of centimillionaires \u2014 those worth $100 million or more \u2014 has more than doubled over the past 20 years to over 28,000, according to Henley & Partners and New World Wealth. There are now an estimated 2,700 billionaires in the world, according to Forbes, more than 2.5 times the number in 2010.\nAt the same time, the ultra-wealthy are changing the way they manage their investments and financial lives. Rather than handing over their fortunes to a single private bank or wealth management firm, today's mega-wealthy are opting to create single-family offices to better represent their interests and long-term goals. Family offices are seen as offering more privacy, more customization and more tailored programs for the next generation of the family.\n\"They want a team that's entirely dedicated to them, 24 hours a day,\" Gooch said. \"Not only with investing, but in all the different areas of their life.\"\nAfter the financial crisis, wealthy families also want advisors that represent the family's best interests, rather than private bank or wealth management advisors incentivized by the need to sell product.\n\"There are some organizations that don't have products to pitch, but a lot of them do,\" said Eric Johnson, Deloitte's private wealth leader and family office tax leader. \"And, lo and behold, if you engage them, what you're going to have to buy is kind of what they're selling, which might not be the best for the family.\"\nMore than two-thirds of family offices have been created since 2000, according to Deloitte. The largest number (41%) were founded by the original wealth creators, while 30% serve the second generation (inheritors) and 19% serve the third generation.\nNorth America is leading the family office revolution. Family office wealth in North America is expected to grow by 258% between 2019 and 2030, compared with 208% in the Asia-Pacific region. North America's 3,180 single-family offices are expected to balloon to 4,190 by 2030, accounting for about 40% of the world's total. Asia-Pacific has about 2,290 family offices today, expected to grow to 3,200 by 2030.\nThe total wealth held by families with family offices in North America has more than doubled since 2019, to $2.4 trillion. It's expected to reach $4 trillion by 2030, according to Deloitte.\nThat $5 trillion pool of capital globally has touched off a feeding frenzy on Wall Street to help family offices manage their money. From Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to UBS, J.P. Morgan Private Bank, Citi Private Bank, and myriad trust companies and multifamily offices, traditional wealth-management firms are poaching family office specialists and launching new family office teams to better target the growth.\nAccounting firms, tax attorneys, consulting firms and tech companies are also waking up to the power of family offices, which can now more easily outsource parts of their business to keep costs lower.\n\"There is a whole new arena of companies that benefit from this ecosystem,\" Gooch said.\nAs they expand in both size and number, family offices are also becoming more institutionalized. Rather than two- or three-person shops focused on basic portfolios and arranging family travel, today's family offices are more like boutique investment firms. The average family office has a staff of 15 people managing $2 billion, according to Deloitte.\nFamily offices are also changing how they invest. Instead of the old-school 60-40 stock and bond portfolios, family offices are shifting their money to alternative assets, including private equity, venture capital, real estate and private credit.\nFamily offices now have 46% of their total portfolio in alternative investments, according to the J.P. Morgan Private Bank Global Family Office Report. The largest amount is in private equity, at 19%. Aside from investing in private equity funds, more family offices are doing direct deals, where they invest directly in a private company.\nA survey by BNY Wealth found that 62% of family offices made at least six direct investments last year, and 71% plan to make the same number of direct deals this year.\nPrivate equity giants like Blackstone, KKR and Carlyle are building out their private wealth teams to better target family offices. Deal-makers for private companies are also discovering family offices, which can buy equity stakes or entire companies. Since family offices have long time horizons, preferring to invest for decades or even generations, they're seen as more \"patient capital\" compared with private equity firms or venture capital.\n\"Family offices can be very solid, strong partners to invest with,\" Gooch said. \"I think a lot of the private companies are very grateful for their long-term patient capital and their dedication to this space.\"\nTo support their growing assets and responsibilities, family offices are on a hiring spree. Fully 40% of family offices plan to hire more staff this year, according to Deloitte. More than a third (36%) say they plan to increase the number of services they provide to the family, or increase the number of family members served. More than a third (34%) are also increasing their reliance on outsourcing, Deloitte notes.\nDeloitte said the biggest trends for family offices in the coming years will be the continued move toward \"institutionalization\" \u2014 with more professional management, governance and technology. More than a quarter of family offices now have multiple \"branches\" to serve different parts of the family, often in other countries.\nAnd with the great wealth transfer expected to shift trillions of dollars to spouses and the next generation, more women and inheritors will start running family offices in the coming years. The average age of family office principals in the Deloitte survey was 68 years old, and 4 in 10 family offices will go through a succession process in the next decade.\nWhile women represent 10% of the wealth holders for those with $100 million or more, they control 15% of the world's family offices, according to the survey.\n\"On a like-for-like basis with men, women are somewhat more likely to become the principal of the family office,\" Gooch said. \"Family offices can really focus on key stages of life, like retirement or legacy planning. And making sure the next generation is prepared.\""
