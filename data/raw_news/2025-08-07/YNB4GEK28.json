  "title": "Think the Cybertruck looks weird? Check out its wedge-shaped predecessors",
  "description": "A new exhibition explores wedge-shaped cars that emerged in the 1960s, and looks at the way radical ideas have changed automotive design.",
  "content": "If this sounds like the kind of question one might ask when seeing a Tesla Cybertruck for the first time, it\u2019s actually just a rhyme of history. That head-turner/head-scratcher was the 1968 Alfa Romeo Carabo, an outrageously pointy concept car that radically diverged from the teardrop designs of the day. It was arguably the start of a bold, if short-lived, new chapter in the history of car design: the wedge. The Bertone-designed Alfa Romeo Carabo debuted at the 1968 Paris Motor Show. [Photo: LAT Images/Getty Images] The Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles explores this wildly experimental era in car design with The Wedge Revolution: Cars on the Cutting Edge, a new exhibition now on display. The exhibition features dozens of cars designed between the late 1960s and mid-\u201980s that used a blocky wedge shape as their defining form factor. They were oddball designs at the time, and most didn\u2019t make it past the concept stage, but they heralded a rebellious era in car design that may just be underway once more. Case in point: the Cybertruck. \u201cThat\u2019s why Franz was involved in the show,\u201d says Jonathan Eisen, a curator at the Petersen museum. The Franz he\u2019s talking about is Tesla\u2019s chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, creator of the Cybertruck, who was called in to cocurate the exhibition. \u201cHe\u2019s very enthusiastic about the classic wedge cars.\u201d\n\nLike his own design, the wedge cars of the mid-20th century seemed to have come out of nowhere. Eisen says the dominant design approach at the time was either the teardrop-shaped coupes made in France or the bulbous, chrome-laden sedans from American carmakers. But as the main designers behind these cars retired, a new generation came in ready to try something completely different. \u201cThey went the opposite way,\u201d Eisen says. \u201cThey did away with all the ornamentation. And instead of smooth, flowing lines they decided that they were going to use sharp edges and flat planes and base the look of the car on the wedge.\u201d Carmakers including Chevrolet, Honda, BMW, Aston Martin, Lamborghini, and Bertoni all dabbled in wedge-shaped car design. One concept car featured in the exhibition, the 1976 Honda Civic Lady, was an angular version of the Civic, one of the most popular compact cars of the era. With a wedge nose and a station wagon tail, it showed off a combination of design and sensibility. Though never intended for production, its DNA lived on for decades.\n\n\u201cIf you then look at Hondas from the 1980s and even into the 1990s, you could absolutely see that they go back to this one car,\u201d Eisen says. Other cars in the show are far less sensible, like the batwinged 1979 Aston Martin Bulldog concept car and the 1977 UrbaCar, a dune buggy meets bumper car. On the extreme end, the 1971 Lamborghini Countach concept car came to define the sharp and wedgy shape of Lamborghinis for decades. These car companies \u201cweren\u2019t afraid to put something out there that maybe isn\u2019t traditionally beautiful, but it\u2019s still unlike anything else on the road and will absolutely draw your attention to it,\u201d Eisen says. \u201cA car doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be pretty to be successful. The way that SUVs are so popular is proof of that. \u201c\n\nThe Cybertruck, on the other hand? Eisen calls it the only true wedge car on the road today, and possibly the start of a more adventurous era in car design, even if its success is questionable. \u201cThat car obviously has a very controversial design, and you could even say that it\u2019s been thoroughly rejected by the mass public,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe people aren\u2019t ready for it yet. But eventually, I think we will see more creativity.\u201d In recent decades, car design has been very safe, and guided by aerodynamics, efficiency, and, above all, marketing, according to Eisen. The heyday of the wedge was less constrained and, arguably, more interesting. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth celebrating the fact that it\u2019s okay to take chances,\u201d Eisen says. The Wedge Revolution is on display through September 2026.",
