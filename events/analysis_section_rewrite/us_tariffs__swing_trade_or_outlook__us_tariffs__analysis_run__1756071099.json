      "feedback": "Actionable edit guidance to lift the draft to world-class level: enforce the exact Movers format (4 lines total: 2 Up, 2 Down) with clean field separation (Direction | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %), and keep the Horizon windows non-overlapping (0–3, 3–6, 6–12 months) to avoid confounding scenarios; tie each Driver/Mechanism to a tight first-principles causal chain (tariff pass-through -> input costs -> inflation/margins; deregulation momentum -> capex/investment flow -> supply-chain realignment; cross-border frictions -> pricing power), and make What to watch a concrete, monitorable trigger or data point; anchor probabilities to explicit in-material facts (e.g., 1.8% inflation impulse, 18.6% average tariff, $350m tariff costs, 1,800 Goodyear layoffs) and attach in-text IDs only after factual statements; ensure every number cited has a corresponding source-id (e.g., 9W8ZUIBDY, WLXM1819K, OFY11YO0I, AJTHKYXQ3, 2SJORBV6H, QRX2HD4X0) and reconcile any numeric conflicts by stating a single base-case with clearly labeled alt-values; for the Outlook line, use a single Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100 format, starting with a neutral/mixed direction and 6–12 month horizon, and keep it succinct (one line preferred); ensure the Outlook reflects the base-case trajectory (tariffs persist with incremental settlements, inflation around the 1.8% lift and ~18% tariff breadth, with governance/deregulation risks) while clearly flagging the key invalidation and trigger events; avoid extraneous narrative, filler, or non-source-backed claims, and ensure every assertion aligns with the cited material without introducing new IDs or divergent numbers. This will deliver a precise, scenario-driven Swing/Outlook that is fully grounded in the provided sources and easily auditable against them.",
