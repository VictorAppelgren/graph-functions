      "feedback": "Your draft is too broad and lacks the focused, scenario‑driven structure required for a 3–6‑month equity outlook. First, narrow the scope to a single asset class (e.g., U.S. small‑cap equities) and build a clear base‑case, upside, and downside scenario. Use first‑principles logic: small‑cap valuations are driven by earnings growth, IPO activity, and risk‑premium compression; link each to concrete catalysts (Fed rate hikes, UAS contract awards, dividend declarations). Quantify every claim and embed source IDs immediately after the statement: e.g., “Russell 2000 P/E ≈12 versus S&P 500 ≈20 (Q7VVGNSQE)”; “UAS jobs rose to 1,400 in 2025 with an average salary of $105,912 (FOM34PUWA)”; “Vor Biopharma’s 12‑month target range $0.40–$3.00 (M2PF568NP)”. Define a 3‑month trigger window: Fed minutes in Q3 2025, CPI release in May, UAS contract award announcements in June, dividend dates in July, and small‑cap earnings in August. Outline risk premia: a 0.25% Fed hike could raise the small‑cap risk premium by ~0.5% (invalidating the base case). Provide a watch list of signals and assign a confidence rating (e.g., moderate‑high). Finally, reconcile any conflicting data (e.g., UAS job growth vs. lack of state‑level data) by noting the data’s limitations. This structured, citation‑rich, and quantitatively grounded rewrite will elevate the analysis to world‑class quality.",
