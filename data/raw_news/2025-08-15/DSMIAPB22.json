  "description": "Erik ten Hag has made a winning start as Bayer Leverkusen coach with a 4-0 result at fourth-tier team Sonnenhof Gro\u00dfaspach in the first round of the German Cup.",
  "content": "BERLIN (AP) \u2014 Erik ten Hag made a winning start as Bayer Leverkusen coach with a 4-0 result at fourth-tier team Sonnenhof Gro\u00dfaspach in the first round of the German Cup on Friday.\n\nPatrik Schick, Brazilian wing back Arthur, debutant Christian Kofane and \u00c1lex Grimaldo all scored, but they assumed control only after Gro\u00dfaspach captain Volkan Celikwas was sent off in the 66th with two bookings in as many minutes.\n\nLeverkusen was forced to defend for long periods after Schick\u2019s 32nd-minute opener. The Czech forward also needed to clear the ball off the line.\n\nArthur scored the second shortly after Celikwas\u2019 sending off and the other goals followed Mert Tasdelen\u2019s late sending off for a bad challenge on Leverkusen defender Axel Tape.\n\nTen Hag, the former Manchester United manager, took over from the Real Madrid-bound Xabi Alonso and has had little time to work with a squad undergoing huge changes. Key players like Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong and Granit Xhaka have left while Kofane, Tape, Ibrahim Maza, Jarell Quansah and goalkeeper Mark Flekken all made their debuts on Friday.\n\nThe game was interrupted in the first half by a summer storm featuring hailstones. Referee Michael Bacher led the teams off the field. It resumed after a 40-minute break.\n\nAlso, Union Berlin routed G\u00fctersloh, another fourth-tier side, 5-0 away, and second-division Magdeburg enjoyed a 3-1 win at third-division Saarbr\u00fccken.\n\nUnion used dead-ball situations to take a 3-0 halftime lead, with Robert Skov firing in a free kick, and Leopold Querfeld and Danilho Doekhi scoring after corners.\n\nUnion goalkeeper Frederik R\u00f6nnow had to go off early in the second half after indicating he was feeling dizzy. Matheo Raab went on for his Union debut but had little to do as Andrej Ili\u0107 scored and then set up Jeong Woo-yeong to complete the rout.",

      "text": "UEFA charges Israeli and Polish clubs over political fan banners that raised diplomatic tension\nUEFA charges Israeli and Polish clubs over political fan banners that raised diplomatic tension\nNYON, Switzerland (AP) \u2014 UEFA opened a disciplinary case Friday after an Israeli soccer club\u2019s fans displayed a banner targeting Poland that was criticized by the Polish president and diplomats from Israel.\nFallout from the Maccabi Haifa vs. Rakow Czestochowa game Thursday in UEFA\u2019s Conference League adds to current scrutiny around non-sporting issues being aired at international soccer.\nThe slogan \u201cMurderers since 1939\u201d in English was shown by Maccabi Haifa fans at a qualifying game in UEFA\u2019s Conference League against Polish team Rakow. It was quickly condemned by the president of Poland and Israel\u2019s embassy in the country.\nPolish President Karol Nawrocki posted on X the banner was \u201cscandalous\u201d and an insult to Polish victims of World War Two including three million Jews.\nMaccabi Haifa and Rakow played the game in neutral Hungary \u2014 instead of Israel for security reasons \u2014 one week after the first leg in Poland. There, Rakow fans showed a banner in Polish saying Israel was murdering people and the world was silent.\nUEFA said Friday both clubs have been charged with \u201ctransmitting a message not fit for a sports event\u201d in a case that will be judged by its disciplinary panel.\nNo timetable was given for imposing sanctions which could be fines and closing part of a stadium at a future game. Rakow won 2-0 Thursday and eliminated Maccabi Haifa 2-1 on aggregate score.\nThe Polish government\u2019s foreign ministry said Friday it had spoken with Israel\u2019s ambassador to the country, Yaakov Finkelstein.\n\u201cHe expressed his utmost outrage at the scandalous content of a banner displayed by the Israeli fans and thanked for its firm condemnation by the embassy,\u201d the Polish ministry said in a statement.\nPoland\u2019s ambassador in Israel also was set to discuss the incident with Israel\u2019s government, the ministry said, adding: \u201cPolish-Israeli relations must not, and will not, be undermined by extremists.\u201d\nUEFA does not allow overt political messaging by fans or clubs in stadiums at European competition games it organizes but was itself criticized this week.\nOn Wednesday, UEFA displayed the message \u201cStop Killing Children. Stop Killing Civilians\u201d on the field before its showpiece Super Cup game between the Champion League title holder Paris Saint-Germain and Europa League winner Tottenham, played at Udine, Italy.\nUEFA said it was part of a campaign with its charitable foundation that has projects helping children affected by conflicts also in Afghanistan, Lebanon, Sudan, Syria, Yemen and Ukraine.\nWhen the PSG and Tottenham players were presented with their medals, the post-game ceremony involved two Palestinian children who are refugees in Italy from Gaza.\nAt the Champions League final played in Munich in May, PSG fans displayed a banner \u201cStop Genocide in Gaza\u201d in English. UEFA did not punish the Qatari-owned French club for the display.\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"

Alonso will take over on June 1 and will be given a contract through June 2028, the club said.\nHe\u2019s to be presented as coach on Monday.\nThe 65-year-old Ancelotti is departing after four mostly successful seasons with Madrid. He bid a tearful farewell on Saturday in the team\u2019s final Spanish league match. Ancelotti\u2019s contract ran to the end of next season, but the club confirmed his departure on Friday after he had already been announced as the next Brazil coach.\nMadrid began the season by winning the UEFA Super Cup title but mostly struggled since then, failing to lift another trophy and losing all four \u201ccl\u00e1sico\u201d matches against rival Barcelona, which clinched a league and cup double.\nAncelotti on Friday said he felt Alonso had the potential to succeed at Madrid.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to offer advice, because everyone has their own ideas about soccer,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I can say is that he\u2019s hugely fortunate to be Real Madrid\u2019s coach. I wish him all the best, and all the luck in the world. I think he has the attributes to coach this team. I hope he enjoys it.\u201d\nThe club\u2019s official TV channel prepared a video with highlights of Alonso\u2019s career, both as a player and as a coach, saying that \u201cnow he has in front of him the greatest challenge any coach can face, which is to sit on the bench of Real Madrid.\u201d\nThe 43-year-old Alonso is returning to a familiar environment.\n\u201cAlonso is one of the biggest legends of Real Madrid and world football. He defended our shirt in 236 official games between 2009 and 2014. He won six titles during this time: the 10th European Cup in Lisbon, one European Super Cup, one league title, two Spanish Cups and one Spanish Super Cup,\u201d the club said.\n\u201cNow he\u2019s returning to Real Madrid as one of the best coaches in the world after making history with Bayer Leverkusen,\u201d the club said.\nAs coach, Alonso led Leverkusen to an unprecedented German league and cup double last year in his first full season after taking over the team when it was in the Bundesliga\u2019s relegation zone the season before.\nHis team remains the only one to complete a whole Bundesliga campaign unbeaten. Leverkusen\u2019s only defeat in 2023-24 was to Atalanta in the Europa League final, and it bounced back three days later by winning the 2024 German Cup.\nLeverkusen\u2019s 35-game unbeaten run in the Bundesliga ended in August 2024 with a 3-2 loss at home to Leipzig, against whom Alonso\u2019s team uncharacteristically squandered a two-goal lead.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t just train us \u2014 you inspired us,\u201d Leverkusen captain Granit Xhaka wrote on Instagram after Alonso confirmed his departure. \u201cWe\u2019ll carry your lessons far beyond the field.\u201d\nAs a player for Spain and Madrid, Alonso displayed an understanding of the game and technical skills that created time and space for himself, and opportunities for others. Real Sociedad and Liverpool previously benefited from his intelligence in midfield. He helped the latter to the Champions League title in 2005.\nAlonso starred as a Madrid player, winning six titles, including the Spanish league in 2012 and the 2014 Champions League before leaving for three Bundesliga titles with Bayern Munich.\nThere was always a feeling in Madrid he would return. The club takes pride in bringing former greats back for coaching or management roles, like Zinedine Zidane or Jorge Valdano, and Alonso seemed predestined for coaching after a playing career spent managing teammates.\nAlonso began his coaching career with Madrid\u2019s youth teams before returning to Real Sociedad, another former club, to take over its reserve team. He led it to promotion.\nHe exceeded expectations after Leverkusen sporting director Simon Rolfes and chief executive Fernando Carro gave him his first job in senior management in October 2022.\nNow he will face different demands at Madrid, where he will be tasked with responding to a buoyant Barcelona team spearheaded by the outstanding Lamine Yamal and Brazil forward Raphinha supported by a cast of home-grown young stars such as Pedri and Gavi.\nHe will have to put the team\u2019s top stars \u2013 Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Jude Bellingham and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior \u2013 back on track after they failed to help the team succeed toward the end of the season.\nDespite his success in leading Madrid to three Champions League titles, Ancelotti was considered a coach who largely let the players have their way, giving their individual brilliance full reign.\nAlonso is likely to be more structured with a clear idea of how he wants each player to fit into his team. One priority will be strengthening the defense after serious injuries there last season undermined Ancelotti\u2019s hopes of defending the Spanish league and Champions League titles.\nMadrid has already addressed that with the signing of Spain defender Dean Huijsen from Bournemouth. More arrivals are likely.\nWhichever players come or go, Alonso will face the same demands \u2014 to get Madrid back on top in Spain and challenging for a record-extending 16th European crown.\nIt\u2019s just his second job in senior management.\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"

I\u2019m working with them because I am here. If they want to leave, they will knock on my door,\u201d Guardiola.\nThe 21-year-old Savinho joined City last summer on a $45 million transfer and signed a five-year contract but has been linked to Tottenham, which has seen Son Heung-min leave this offseason and James Maddison go down with an ACL tear.\nSavinho, a winger, scored three goals in 48 total appearances last season.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Guardiola responded when asked if Savinho would stay. \u201cTottenham in that case or any other club (that) wants a player should call the club, right?\u201d\nGuardiola insisted that he hopes Savinho stays.\n\u201cI\u2019m only concerned right now today that Savinho will be with us until the rest of the season and hopefully for many, many years because with 21 years old with the potential that he has ... plays lots of minutes, he has to improve in the final decisions ... but he\u2019s an extraordinary player,\u201d Guardiola said.\nStill, Savinho won\u2019t travel with the team for the season opener because of an unspecified injury from last week\u2019s friendly in Sicily.\n\u201cSavinho is injured, sorry I didn\u2019t remember,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cHe\u2019s injured from Palermo. Had a problem. A few weeks he will be out.\u201d\nThe 31-year-old Ederson has been Guardiola\u2019s first-choice goalkeeper since arriving from Benfica in 2017. He\u2019s helped City win six league titles, among other trophies. British press reports say Turkish club Galatasaray wants to sign him.\n\u201cEderson didn\u2019t come to me and say \u2018I want to leave, I have an offer,\u2019 so all the players (who) are here are our players, and I work with them. What\u2019s going to happen (in the transfer window) nobody knows.\u201d\nGuardiola added: \u201cIn the end, as always, the desire of the players (is) above everything.\u201d\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"
