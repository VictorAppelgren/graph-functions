  "content": "GeekWire\u2019s startup coverage documents the Pacific Northwest entrepreneurial scene. Sign up for our weekly startup newsletter , and check out the GeekWire funding tracker and venture capital directory .\n\nA new startup founded earlier this year is building a marketplace for high-performance model portfolios, aiming to give everyday investors access to strategies traditionally reserved for hedge funds and ultra-wealthy clients.\n\nPlutus lets users browse curated, thematic portfolios from independent research providers, select one that fits their goals, and replicate it automatically in their own brokerage accounts.\n\nThe Seattle-area company is led by longtime engineers Shashank Chiranewala and Mitren Chinoy, who previously started and sold digital form startup Formloge earlier this year for an undisclosed sum.\n\nChiranewala, a former investment banker and program manager at Microsoft and Meta, said he was frustrated by the lack of access to sophisticated investment strategies without multimillion-dollar minimums.\n\nAt the same time, he noticed a growing ecosystem of independent research firms serving institutional clients but lacking the technology to bring their portfolios to the mass market.\n\nExecuting complex portfolios manually is a \u201cHerculean software engineering effort,\u201d said Chiranewala, the company\u2019s CEO.\n\nPlutus acts as an advisory marketplace between individual investors and providers such as Citrini Research. Its marketplace offers thematic investment strategies \u2014 portfolios for AI and tech, or global clean energy, for example.\n\nUnlike passive ETFs or mutual funds, the portfolios are designed for automated rebalancing and potential tax advantages. The company takes a cut of subscription fees set by each portfolio provider.\n\nPlutus is initially integrating with Interactive Brokers, a publicly traded online brokerage. Chiranewala said they picked the company for its global market exposure and interest rates.\n\nThe startup is generating revenue from a handful of customers, including family offices, hedge funds, and others. Its software manages more than $35 million in assets.\n\nPlutus also recently raised $452,000 from angel investors. The company has five employees. Chinoy, the company\u2019s CTO, was previously a senior software engineer at Snowflake and Microsoft.",
