Available for 29% off today on Amazon, the Bissell Little Green is a tried, trusted, and true tool for getting rid of pesky pet hair, no matter how much your critter sheds.\n\nOne 5-star Amazon review even states that owning the Bissell Little Green Pet Deluxe is \u201clike having a tiny janitor in your closet.\u201d That\u2019s just one of over 10,000 5-star reviews.\n\nStill not sold? Wondering what makes this Little Green Deluxe Carpet Cleaner so deluxe? Included in the box are the carpet cleaner itself, the PetSpot & Stain+ PET OXY Boost formula, the 3-inch Tough Stain Tool, the Stain Trapper Tool, and the HydroRinse Self-Cleaning Tool, which makes cleaning your Bissell as easy as the push of a button.\n\nThe Bissell Little Green Pet Deluxe Portable Carpet Cleaner is a compact, powerful tool designed for pet owners.
