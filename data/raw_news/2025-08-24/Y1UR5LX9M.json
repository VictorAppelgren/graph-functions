  "content": "'Business as usual' at the Ould Lammas Fair in Ballycastle\n\nIt's \"business as usual\" at this year's Ould Lammas Fair in Ballycastle, despite some changes to the layout of the event. The fair traditionally gets underway on the last bank holiday of the summer, with a number of build-up events held over the weekend. Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council has said an estimated 100,000 people are expected over the four days. Fairhill Street in the centre of the town has been closed since last year after concerns were raised about the integrity of a derelict hotel building.\n\nThe council has placed shipping containers outside a derelict hotel, the Antrim Arms, in the Diamond area in the centre of the town, to protect pedestrians from falling debris. Councillor Cara McShane said the council had been \"working extremely hard\" to ensure that all of the logistical challenges are overcome. \"It has been not without challenge, given the closure of Fairhill Street [due to the shipping containers], where traditionally the horse trading would have taken place. \"The Antrim Arms is just beside the Fairhill so the council has opened up a pedestrian access.\" Meanwhile, a new leisure centre is being built where the fair's amusements are normally located - so they have been moved to private land on the seafront. \"But it's business as usual and we need to ensure best foot forward,\" Ms McShane said. She added that trading licencing and concessionary licencing have increased overall, which the council is pleased about.\n\nPaul Cochrane has been trading in Ballycastle for more than 30 years and is a former chair of the Chamber of Commerce. \"Traditionally, sometimes, people would come home for the Ould Lammas Fair more than Christmas, local families come home because it is such an iconic weekend for everyone,\" he said. \"It's very, very important and even more important now with the economic times that we're in.\"\n\nMr Cochrane said that local businesses are very good at \"working around the economic situation\". \"Obviously this year the situation with the Antrim Arms building isn't ideal,\" he added. \"I think going forward there has to be a bit more communication with our local council, with the local people and with the local businesses, because everything develops and goes on. \"I think going forward it will help with the fair.\" The council is planning to hold a consultation event with the Ballycastle Town Forum immediately following this year's event.",

      "text": "Yellowman - the traditional sweet treat with a secret recipe\n- Published\nHave you heard of the Northern Irish sweet with an original secret recipe known only by three families and sold at a local market in August each year?\nIntroducing - yellowman.\nIt is a unique rock-like sweet, its history shrouded in mystery and its origins up for debate.\nThe treat is near-exclusively tied to the Ould Lammas Fair, an event which has been held in the last week of August in Ballycastle since the 17th Century.\nThe annual event attracts thousands to Northern Ireland's north coast over the bank holiday, which traditionally marked the end of summer and the beginning of harvest.\nFor decades the Devlin, McKeown and Agnew families from Ballymena, County Antrim, were central to yellowman production.\nJohn Devlin believes his grandfather, Joe Devlin, is responsible for naming the confectionery and bringing it to the fair in the early 1900s. His aunt also appears in the archive video included in this article.\nIt provided another form of income for the three families who were primarily fruit sellers, he told BBC News NI.\n\"We (the families) were all related someway, and they all had the one ingredient that none of the rest had or have.\n\u201cFrom early August, it was seven days a week. There were no summer holidays, it was just making yellowman for the Lammas Fair,\u201d he recalled.\n\u201cThe main ingredient was syrup which had to be boiled in huge black pots, plus other ingredients which I am forbidden to say,\" he joked.\n\"When cooled down, the ingredients were pulled over large hooks by hand until it turned a whitish colour,\" he added.\nThe Broughshane man has fond memories working alongside his family, including his father Archie who used to sign the bags.\n\"I never got that high up in the pecking order, but I got the privilege of breaking it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnytime I return to Ballycastle and I drive through the Diamond I can always see the stalls. Sadly, the \u2018old timers\u2019 are all gone,\u201d he added.\nLocal historian Peter Molloy has been attending the fair since he was a child.\nHe said for some the Ould Lammas Fair was a bigger event than Christmas.\nBut where does the association with yellowman originate?\nMuch like the origin of the fair itself, Mr Molloy said the story is shrouded in some mystery and much has been passed on by mouth, rather than written record.\nHe believes the ingredients were locally sourced and developed, leading to its fame as a Ballycastle delicacy.\nWord of yellowman was also spread through the traditional song 'The Ould Lammas Fair', which references the sweet in the lyrics: \"Did you treat your Mary Ann to some Dulse and Yellow Man? At the ould Lammas Fair in Ballycastle-O.\"\nMr Molloy recalls the three families from Ballymena selling the 'traditional' yellowman. For him \"the vivid yellow colour\" version of the candy isn't the same.\nTraditional versus modern yellowman\nWhile neither of the three families are currently involved in the production of yellowman, the popularity and demand for the sweet has led to new producers trying to re-create the sweet from their own family recipes.\nLinda McGibbon, owner of SeaSugar Handmade Confectionery, is a modern producer of yellowman for stalls at the Ould Lammas Fair.\n\u201cIt is a hard rock-like confection not to be confused with honeycomb which is light, airy and melt in the mouth,\" she explained.\n\"It will break into shards the way that honeycomb never would.\"\nHaving previously been a stall holder herself she said the \u201cnostalgic taste\u201d is a huge factor in its continued popularity.\n\u201cIt sells like crazy! I always sold out,\" she said.\n\"I could never bring enough yellowman to the Lammas Fair.\"\nHaving inherited the recipe from her grandmother she felt duty-bound to share the \u201cauthentic taste\u201d with the public.\nShe believes her yellowman, which is golden in colour, is representative of the traditional version sold decades ago.\nFor younger customers this can cause some confusion as most modern yellowman has evolved into a bright yellow confection.\n\u2018We need to cherish it and shout about it\u2019\nMs McGibbon uses traditional methods with a hammer and chisel, completing the \u201clengthy, time consuming and physical\u201d process, her latest spread over two days.\n\u201cYellowman is unique to Northern Ireland and within that County Antrim,\" she continued.\n\"We need to cherish it, hold on to it and shout about it,\" she said.\n\"We don't make enough of our own food heritage and yellowman is part of that.\""
