  "title": "Costco won\u2019t sell abortion pills after outcry from religious groups",
  "description": "A coalition of religious groups, treasurers from Ohio, Texas, Nevada and Utah had contacted the retailer last year requesting it not carry the drug.",
  "content": "Costco said it will not offer abortion pills at any of its more than 500 pharmacies nationwide, a move celebrated by religious groups that lobbied against the drug being dispensed by retailers.\n\nThe Washington state-based wholesaler insisted its decision was based on a lack of customer interest in the medication, Mifepristone, which together with another medicine called misoprostol, is used to end a pregnancy within 10 weeks of gestation.\n\nIt didn\u2019t address whether pressure from conservative organizations influenced the move.\n\nA coalition of religious groups including Idaho-based Inspire Investing, the conservative legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom and treasurers and other financial officials from Ohio, Texas, Nevada and Utah had contacted the retailer last year requesting it not carry the drug, according to Bloomberg News.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very significant win and it\u2019s one we hope to build on this coming year,\u201d said Michael Ross, an attorney working with Alliance Defending Freedom\u2019s corporate engagement division.\n\nRoss indicated the coalition plans to target Walgreens Boots Alliance and CVS next. Both pharmacy chains currently provide mifepristone in states that don\u2019t have abortion restrictions.\n\nPeople living in states that have severely limited abortion can obtain the medication by mail from states without such bans.\n\nThe religious investors sent similar requests last year to Kroger, Walmart and Albertsons alongside Costco, urging them against carrying the medication.\n\nKroger responded that it has never provided abortion pills and continues monitoring regulatory developments. Neither Walmart nor Albertsons currently stocks the medicine.\n\nCostco\u2019s decision intensifies the ongoing debate about access to the medication.\n\nNew York City Comptroller Brad Lander had written to various retailers in July last year representing city pension funds, encouraging them to pursue authorization for offering the drug.\n\n\u201cCostco\u2019s decision to refuse to dispense mifepristone is disappointing and short-sighted,\u201d a representative from Lander\u2019s office told Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cFailure to provide access to proven safe and FDA-approved medication under the guise of \u2018weak demand\u2019 risks isolating customers and undermines the company\u2019s credibility.\u201d\n\nThe Post has sought comment from Costco and Lander.\n\nThe religious organizations have promised to continue to ramp up pressure.\n\n\u201cWe have this momentum,\u201d said Tim Schwarzenberger, who leads corporate engagement at Inspire, which manages the biggest religious exchange-traded fund.\n\n\u201cNow there is a chance to turn to some of the other retailers.\u201d\n\nAmazon.com doesn\u2019t presently sell the medication, and Schwarzenberger indicated his organization will work to maintain that status.\n\nAmazon didn\u2019t provide a response to inquiries. Walgreens declined to comment but referenced information on its website stating: \u201cThe US Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on mifepristone access allows Walgreens to continue to dispense mifepristone under the FDA guidelines.\u201d\n\nCVS confirmed it distributes mifepristone in certain states where permitted after completing what it called a thorough certification procedure.\n\n\u201cWe have a long history of supporting and advancing women\u2019s health and we remain focused on meeting their unique health needs. This includes providing access to safe, legal, and evidence-based reproductive health services,\u201d the company stated.\n\nThe elimination of nationwide abortion protections has resulted in uneven access throughout the US, leading telehealth providers to address some service gaps.\n\nVarious state legislators have proposed legislation to designate mifepristone as a restricted drug and reduce telehealth availability.\n\nAccording to tracking by the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization, lawmakers introduced 32 proposals to prohibit medication abortion and 38 to restrict access during the 2025 legislative period, representing the highest number since the overturn of Roe v. Wade.\n\nData from the Society of Family Planning, an abortion rights organization, shows most abortions in America still occur either at medical facilities or through prescriptions from doctors filled at pharmacies like CVS or Walgreens.\n\nFollowing increased state-level abortion restrictions, more women have pursued online mifepristone prescriptions for mail delivery.\n\nThese shipments now represent approximately 25% of American abortions, up from 5 percent before the 2022 Supreme Court decision that ended federal abortion protections.\n\nEight states permitting abortion have enacted protective legislation shielding doctors from prosecution when prescribing mifepristone to patients in states with abortion prohibitions.\n\nUshma Upadhyay, a reproductive sciences professor at the University of California, San Francisco, explained that CVS, Walgreens and similar pharmacies don\u2019t provide the medication in states prohibiting abortion, creating difficulties for women seeking the procedure.\n\nTelehealth providers can utilize protective laws to ship pills directly to states with restrictions, she noted.\n\nThis has generated legal disputes. A Texas resident filed a lawsuit in July against a California physician for prescribing abortion medication to his girlfriend.\n\nA New York doctor faces criminal charges in Louisiana and a lawsuit from Texas\u2019s Attorney General for shipping pills to patients in those states.",

      "text": "State finance honchos rip NYC Comptroller Brad Lander for pushing big retailers to sell abortion pill \u2018without delay\u2019\nThe top financial officers of 15 conservative states ripped city Comptroller Brad Lander Monday for pressuring major US retailers to sell the abortion pill mifepristone \u201cwithout delay.\u201d\nLander penned several letters to the CEOs of pharmacy giants and retailers including Walmart, Costco, Kroger, Albertsons, and the medical firm McKesson in July urging them to start dispensing mifepristone as soon as possible.\n\u201cBy failing to become certified mifepristone dispensers, these pharmacy giants put both women\u2019s reproductive health care and investors\u2019 money at risk,\u201d he said.\nHe said mifepristone should be available in all states where abortion is legal.\n\u201cMaking mifepristone available benefits customers and employees, increases sales, and generates long-term shareholder value,\u201d said Lander, a candidate for mayor.\nHe noted that New York City\u2019s pension funds hold over $1.3 billion in total shares of the aforementioned companies in his decision to appeal to their CEOs.\nBut the state financial officers \u2014 including Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar \u2014 said Lander should butt out of the marketplace and stay away from Costco.\n\u201cThe Comptroller\u2019s actions are clear attempts to politicize Costco\u2019s business without regard for the company\u2019s financial wellbeing,\u201d anti-abortion finance officers wrote in a letter sent Monday to Costco CEO Ron Vachris.\n\u201cThis radical position ignores all of the business decisions that go into whether to sell a particular product\u2014 decisions that should be made by Costco\u2019s leadership based on how it will serve their customers.\u201d\nThe state officials said Costco admitted that there was no customer demand for the drug in their letter.\n\u201cWe find these actions to be inappropriate. They are an attempt to launder political views through the commercial marketplace with little regard for the companies or their shareholders,\u201d they wrote.\nThey urged Vachris to ignore Lander\u2019s prodding to sell the abortion pill.\nThe letter was co-signed by the financial officers from Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Indiana and Wyoming \u2014 all states with anti-abortion leaders in control.\nEach of the 15 states has complete abortion bans or restrictions in place.\nMeanwhile, blue states including New York have become more active in expanding abortion services \u2014 including distributing abortion pills \u2014 following the Supreme Court\u2019s controversial 2022 decision overturning the 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling, which made women\u2019s choice to have an abortion a federal right.\nIn a stunning reversal, the Supreme Court ruled in 2022 that it should be up to the states to determine whether and when a woman can terminate a pregnancy.\nOther faith-based anti-abortion investors have urged retailers not to sell the abortion pill.\nLander\u2019s office had no immediate comment on the criticism, but he\u2019s unlikely to back down.\nHe warned the companies of potential harm.\n\u201cConcerns include the company\u2019s responsiveness to a growing market opportunity, its mitigation of potential reputational risks, and its commitment to maximizing sales and long-term shareholder value,\u201d Lander wrote in the letter to retailers."

      "text": "Ex-Kroger CEO must reveal \u2018embarrassing\u2019 details about his abrupt exit thanks to lawsuit involving Jewel\nA Cincinnati judge has ordered former Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen to provide a written account of why he abruptly left the grocery giant in March \u2014 potentially exposing details the executive\u2019s attorneys have called \u201ccompletely irrelevant\u201d and \u201cembarrassing\u201d in a lawsuit that involves singer Jewel.\nThe circumstances surrounding 65-year-old McMullen\u2019s surprise resignation have become a point of interest in a lawsuit unrelated to his exit.\nJewel \u2014 the songstress known for \u201990s hits like \u201cFoolish Games\u201d and \u201cHands\u201d \u2014 has together with a business partner sued Kroger over the company\u2019s annual Wellness Festival, claiming they were central to launching the event and are owed damages over alleged contractual problems.\nTheir lawyers argued that delving into details of McMullen\u2019s resignation could be relevant to his credibility if he appears as a witness and could inform the court\u2019s view of what they describe as an \u201callegedly corrupt corporate culture at Kroger.\u201d\nMcMullen\u2019s legal team pushed back, calling the questions \u201ccompletely irrelevant\u201d and \u201cembarrassing,\u201d but the judge ordered him to answer in writing.\nThe Aug. 1 directive from Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge Christian Jenkins required McMullen to submit a sworn explanation by Aug. 8 that details the reason for his exit and identifies others involved, according to the court\u2019s order.\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether McMullan had complied with the order. The Post has reached out to McMullen\u2019s lawyers for comment.\nWhether any written account from McMullen becomes public will depend on a later ruling about its relevance to the case. The judge can keep it under seal if he decides it matters to the lawsuit, or exclude it entirely if it does not.\nMcMullen stepped down after more than a decade leading the Cincinnati-based grocery company, following what Kroger described as an investigation into his \u201cpersonal conduct.\u201d\nThe company did not elaborate at the time. As part of his departure, McMullen forfeited all unvested equity and bonuses \u2014 $11 million in total, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nMcMullen earned $15.7 million in 2023.\n\u201cUsually a CEO has downside protection if they leave,\u201d Eric Chaffee, a corporate law professor at Case Western Reserve University, told Fortune.\n\u201cThe fact that he was willing to give that up may provide some insight that what went on here was something he did not want revealed.\u201d\nChaffee told Fortune it is \u201csomewhat invasive\u201d to probe a CEO\u2019s departure, but noted that Kroger itself linked the resignation to \u201cbusiness ethics,\u201d which can make the line of inquiry easier to justify.\nIn civil litigation, he added, attorneys commonly try to \u201ctest that individual\u2019s credibility \u2026 to figure out whether they behave in an ethical manner.\u201d\nChaffee pointed out that US courts strongly favor openness. There is, he said, a \u201cstrong preference that the public has access to judicial proceedings \u2014 not just to be nosy, but because transparency makes for a fairer legal system.\u201d\nThe judge will ultimately decide how much of McMullen\u2019s account the public can see, if any.\nKroger\u2019s sparse explanation left room for speculation when McMullen resigned, and the new order renews interest in what the company and its former leader have chosen not to disclose.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cloud that\u2019s left by his departure,\u201d Chaffee told Fortune, \u201cbut companies sometimes decide that\u2019s better than the damage that could come from disclosure.\u201d\nFor McMullen, silence may also be a rational choice.\n\u201cIt might be something embarrassing to him personally, to a family member, or something that could have future repercussions for his career,\u201d Chaffee told Fortune.\nExecutive careers can hinge on public perception, and \u201cif you\u2019re a CEO and there are news reports out there that you\u2019ve done something you shouldn\u2019t have, getting another top job can become very, very difficult,\u201d he said.\nThe Post has sought comment from Kroger, McMullen and Jewel."

      "text": "Hertz customers charged for minor damages by AI scanners can fight back using these phone apps\nRental car drivers are arming themselves with new AI-powered apps to fend any bogus charges from the growing use of the same technology by major companies like Hertz and Sixt.\nOne such application, Proofr, launched last month, offers users the ability to create their own digital evidence.\n\u201cIt eliminates the \u2018he said, she said\u2019 disputes with rental car companies by giving users a tamper-proof, AI-powered before-and-after damage scan in seconds,\u201d Proofr CEO Eric Kuttner told The Post.\nBoth Sixt and Hertz have recently faced backlash from renters who accused the companies of sideswiping them with outrageous charges for minor damages \u2014 including one Hertz renter who claimed being slapped with $440 penalty for a one-inch scuff on one of the car\u2019s wheels.\nProofr\u2019s system not only identifies scratches and dents but also timestamps, geotags and securely stores the images to prevent alteration.\n\u201cBecause AI is now being used against consumers by rental companies to detect damage, Proofr levels the playing field,\u201d Kuttner told The Post.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the easiest way to protect yourself from surprise damage bills that can run into the thousands all for less than the average person spends on coffee monthly.\u201d\nThe service costs $9.90 per month, with a three-day free trial available for new users.\nThe technology powering Proofr relies on sophisticated image analysis.\nAccording to Kuttner, the company employs \u201ca state of the art AI image analysis pipeline to detect and log even subtle damage changes between photo sets.\u201d\nEach scan undergoes encryption, receives a timestamp and gets locked to the specific location to ensure authenticity.\nThe system\u2019s AI models have been trained using thousands of real-world images to improve accuracy.\nEarly adopters have already successfully used the app to challenge damage claims.\nDespite launching only recently, Kuttner noted that users have won disputes against what they considered unfair charges, though the company remains relatively unknown to the broader public.\nAnother player in this space, Ravin AI, has taken a different approach after initially working with rental companies.\nThe company previously partnered with Avis in 2019 and Hertz in 2022 during early experiments with AI inspections.\nHowever, Ravin has since shifted its focus toward insurance companies and dealerships, currently working with IAG, the largest insurance firm in Australia and New Zealand.\nRavin\u2019s founder and CEO, Eliron Ekstein, told The Drive that the company\u2019s pivot away from rental partnerships stemmed partly from concerns about customer treatment.\n\u201cWhen you work for a car rental company, if you go about this in the wrong way, then you\u2019re actually going against their interests. Because you\u2019re going against their customers in the end,\u201d Ekstein told The Drive.\n\u201cAnd we quickly realized that if we maximize our proceeds in that business, we\u2019re actually going against their customers and themselves at the end of the day.\u201d\nThe recent wave of customer complaints about AI-generated damage claims prompted Ravin to make its technology freely available to consumers through a demo on its homepage.\nThe system, trained on two billion images over ten years, allows users to scan their vehicles and receive reports documenting any differences between before and after photos.\nEkstein believes rental agencies are currently charging excessive fees for minor blemishes to \u201cjustify the cost\u201d of their scanning equipment.\nHe pointed to ProovStation\u2019s marketing language, which promises to turn \u201croutine inspections into gold mines of untapped opportunities,\u201d as evidence of this profit-focused approach.\nHertz and Sixt have begun implementing automated vehicle inspection systems from companies like UVeye and ProovStation at multiple locations, with other rental agencies watching closely.\nThese AI scanners detect damage without human review, potentially flagging every minor imperfection on returned vehicles.\nTesting of these consumer apps reveals both promise and limitations. The Drive\u2019s evaluation found Ravin\u2019s system missed two obvious paint chips while incorrectly identifying a reflection as minor damage.\nSimilarly, Proofr\u2019s app, while featuring an attractive interface, experienced repeated crashes during image saving, according to The Drive.\nThese issues highlight ongoing challenges in the technology, particularly regarding photo conditions and lighting.\n\u201cWho takes the image, what time, [and] what angle\u201d can dramatically affect results, Ekstein acknowledged, noting that environmental factors remain one of the biggest obstacles for accurate damage detection.\nDespite these limitations, Ekstein stressed the importance of transparency in damage claims.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go after scuffs \u2014 that goes against the whole service culture of those companies,\u201d he told The Drive.\nHe argued that rental companies should only pursue claims for substantial damage costing at least $700 to repair, and customers should receive detailed repair estimates rather than flat fees.\nKuttner frames this technological shift as a pivotal moment.\n\u201cWe believe this is a turning point for AI moving from something that works for companies to something that works for everyone,\u201d he told The Post.\nThe Post has sought comment from Hertz, Sixt, UVeye and ProovStation."
