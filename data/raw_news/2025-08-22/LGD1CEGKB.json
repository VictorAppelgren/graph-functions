  "title": "'A different breed': SpaceX's sprawling Starbase still rising from South Texas sand flats",
  "description": "SpaceX's remote coastal launch site about 2.2 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border has hosted nine Starship test flights since April 2023.",
  "content": "BOCA CHICA, TEXAS \u2014 Mirages shimmered across the sand flats amid the 95-degree South Texas sun approaching SpaceX's sprawling Starbase, where a huge Starship rocket and two Super Heavy boosters loomed on the horizon like a setting from a \"Dune\" movie.\n\nVehicles jounce eastward toward Starbase along sparsely populated Boca Chica Boulevard, the lone two-lane road leading from \"civilization\" near Brownsville to SpaceX's isolated Starship operations nearly a half-hour away. Years of heavy construction-truck traffic headed to SpaceX's futuristic facilities battered this asphalt into long stretches of shock-absorber-pounding patched potholes.\n\nPerhaps America's oddest drive to the beach, motorists navigate the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge's scenic scrubby flats, flocks of birds and patches of cacti before abruptly driving right up to the Starship-Super Heavy \"rocket garden\" staging area and production site.\n\nThen the road winds past SpaceX's newly built black-glass-walled offices and Starfactory \u2014 which could fit 15 football fields inside \u2014 before ending at the dune line near Starship's soaring twin launch towers. One is the chopstick-equipped Mechazilla, which is designed to catch descending Super Heavy boosters in midair.\n\n\"Coming out here is a different breed. You've got to be tough to be here,\" said Jack Yuen, founder of the nonprofit Maker SpaceX Boca Chica and leader of the Mars Society's Brownsville/Starbase chapter.\n\n\"Hanging out in Florida: 'Oh, I feel like going to Disney, I feel like going to this bar, I feel like going here, this nightclub.' You can't do that here,\" Yuen said.\n\nSpaceX's remote coastal launch site about 2.2 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border has hosted nine Starship test flights since April 2023, capturing worldwide media attention. Yuen said all Starship missions look different, a stark contrast to the practically routine rocket liftoffs from Florida's Space Coast. That's where 70 orbital launches have already occurred thus far this year.\n\nThe last three Starship rockets broke apart and exploded during test flights earlier this year, while another blew up during a June engine test at Starbase's Massey's site, a former gun range off Boca Chica Boulevard.\n\n\"After we waited for two years with no launch, it goes up. It's like a good-sized skyscraper \u2014 not a small skyscraper, but a good-sized skyscraper. It went up, and it was crooked,\" Yuen recalled of Starship's April 2023 maiden flight, holding out his cell phone pointed askew.\n\n\"And everybody was afraid that the darn thing was going to explode. So it didn't explode; it did knock out a lot of concrete that was underneath it. But it went up crooked, and it kept on going up,\" Yuen said.\n\nThat inaugural Starship-Super Heavy tandem did end up exploding nearly four minutes after liftoff during \"a rapid unscheduled disassembly,\" SpaceX reported. Now on Sunday, SpaceX crews will target Starship's 10th flight test during an hourlong launch window extending from 7:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. EST.\n\nDuring his State of the City Address in March, Brownsville Mayor John Cowen Jr. said SpaceX employed more than 2,100 local workers and invested more than $3 billion in Starbase. Next, the colossal Starship-Super Heavy rocket system is coming to NASA's Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\n\nFlorida officials project the Starship program will generate at least $1.8 billion in capital investment and 600 new full-time jobs on the Space Coast by 2030. Already under construction at the Cape: a Gigabay standing 380 feet tall and housing about 46.5 million cubic feet of interior processing space with 815,000 square feet of workspace.\n\nBut Yuen views today's flight-test days as merely \"an emerging space thing\" during SpaceX's march to the moon, Mars and a science fiction-like era of space travel. Under the direction of founding billionaire Elon Musk, SpaceX aims to someday build up to 1,000 Starships in Texas per year, with the rockets designed to transport up to 100 people on long-duration interplanetary treks.\n\n\"Thirty or 40 years from now, they're going to be having launches every day. All the buildings that are built will be tossed aside,\" Yuen said of Starbase.\n\n\"This is going to be like 'Star Wars' going on here. That's what I think's going to happen,\" Yuen said.\n\nAt KSC, SpaceX seeks Federal Aviation Administration licensing approval to soon launch up to 44 Starship-Super Heavy rocket-booster tandems per year from pad 39A.\n\nAnd social media chatter continues growing in opposition to SpaceX's proposal to periodically close access to Playalinda Beach and Canaveral National Seashore for security purposes, starting about three hours prior to those Starship launches.\n\nSpaceX's KSC proposal also includes up to 44 Super Heavy booster landings and up to 44 Starship landings per year. Landings would occur at pad 39A, atop a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean, or into the sea in expendable fashion. Starship landings could also happen in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, with some missions aimed at post-splashdown recovery.\n\nNext week, FAA officials will collect comments on Starship environmental impacts during four public meetings at two Brevard County locations:\n\u2022 None Tuesday, Aug. 26: 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Astronauts Memorial Foundation Center for Space Education at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.\n\u2022 None Thursday, Aug. 28: 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Radisson Resort at the Port, 8701 Astronaut Blvd., Cape Canaveral.\n\nA virtual meeting will also occur from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Sept. 3. Comments can also be submitted online at regulations.gov.\n\nThe FAA's most conservative estimate projects 33 to 44 full-day closures and up to 33 half-day closures per year, totaling the equivalent of 60\u00bd days. But scrubs and weather delays would increase those totals.\n\nA judge in Cameron County, Texas, has ordered Boca Chica Beach and more than 14 miles of Boca Chica Boulevard to close from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. CST Sunday for Starship flight-testing activities and the launch attempt.\n\nThe Sierra Club, Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe of Texas and environmental group SaveRGV are suing Texas officials for closing Boca Chica Beach for SpaceX operations, saying the closures are unconstitutional. In a March letter to Texas Senate officials, Sierra Club officials said they expect the case to advance all the way to the Texas Supreme Court.\n\nFully stacked, the two-stage Starship system (a 171-foot Starship atop a 232-foot Super Heavy Booster) stands 403 feet tall. In terms of scale in downtown Melbourne, that's like stacking Trinity Towers West (175 feet), Trinity Towers East (145 feet) and the Highline apartment complex (96 feet) on top of each other. Those three buildings total 416 feet in height.\n\nDuring an Aug. 7 media roundtable, United Launch Alliance President and CEO Tory Bruno noted that Starship measures \"much larger than a Saturn V.\"\n\n\"Starship is an interesting vehicle, in that it's not just another rocket on the range. It is of an unprecedented size,\" Bruno told reporters.\n\n\"The request that has been put in for the licenses (is) at a very, very high launch rate. So we are counting on the Space Force and the FAA to do a very thorough analysis of that, and how it will affect not just the ecological environment but also the launch environment,\" he said, citing operational impacts on other Eastern Range launch providers.\n\nThe obvious parallel to Starbase on Florida's Space Coast is Blue Origin's tremendous, ever-expanding New Glenn rocket factory, which sprawls off Space Commerce Way just south of the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.\n\nMotorists can drive past and gawk at the complex of huge blue buildings across more than 230 acres. But Blue Origin's massive New Glenn rockets \u2014 which measure taller than a football field \u2014 are rarely visible outside the factory.\n\nNeither is the company's launch tower. Blue Origin sends New Glenns into flight from Launch Complex 36, a $1 billion-plus rebuilt liftoff site shielded far from the public behind the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station security gates. By contrast, Starbase's nearest launch tower stands about \u2155-mile from a public beach.\n\n\"It is unprecedented,\" Alexandre Casset, a 24-year-old French engineering student pursing a doctorate degree, said of Starbase. \"You can't do that with Blue Origin, ULA and all these companies. They don't allow people to go that close to the actual launch sites.\"\n\nCasset, who dreams of working for SpaceX someday, and Yuen embody a comparitively small but growing space-centric community in nearby Brownsville and South Padre Island. Generations of residents are accustomed to spaceflight in the Cape Canaveral area, where missiles and rockets have taken flight since July 1950. Conversely, SpaceX's rapid, disruptive Texas growth has created tension among local residents, Yuen said, bumping his fists together.\n\nYuen has served as a South Texas SpaceX public ambassador. In March 2021, he and his family were introduced to the area while camping for 12 days in a Mercedes Sprinter van while waiting to watch a Starship prototype launch from Isla Blanca Park on South Padre Island.\n\nThat June, he and his wife, Helen, bought a rural 13-acre ranch located about 17 miles from Starbase. She coins the property \"the landing pad\" \u2014 current and future SpaceX engineers have stayed there, while hundreds of space enthusiasts have visited.\n\nYuen founded MSX Boca Chica as part of the \"maker movement\" that promotes do-it-yourself engineering and creativity. SpaceX engineers designed a rock-climbing wall inside his ranch warehouse, and equipment lies everywhere for welding, plasma cutting, 3D printing and electrical projects.\n\nIn April 2022, MSX Boca Chica organized a \"Starbase Tailgate V1\" rally alongside the rocket factory to show support for SpaceX from Rio Grande Valley residents. A couple hundred people attended the rally. Some wore chrome alien helmets with black visors. Others waved SpaceX flags and handwritten signs.\n\nThat 2022 event took place about \u00bd-mile down Boca Chica Boulevard from Boca Chica Village. The village is now a newly incorporated, secretive SpaceX company town mostly inhabited by employees that was created in May via a 212-6 vote. This rapidly expanding housing area with tiny homes and travel trailers alongside Starfactory generated controversy with a plan to restrict public access via roadway gates.\n\nFLORIDA TODAY sent messages seeking comment from SpaceX, Starbase's city administrator and city clerk, and its three elected officials: Mayor Bobby Peden (SpaceX's vice president of Texas Test and Launch), Commissioner Jordan Buss (SpaceX's senior director of environmental, health and safety) and Commissioner Jenna Petrzelka (who served as Space's manager of operations engineering at Starbase). No messages were returned.\n\nBack at the MSX Boca Chica ranch, Casset has occupied a bed in a corner since July 2 while awaiting the next Starship launch. He flew to Texas from Europe, and he laughed while recalling the two rounds of questioning he received from international customs personnel at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.\n\n\"I was specific. The first question they asked was, 'What will you do during these two months in the U.S.?' I said, 'I will watch a SpaceX launch in Brownsville.' And they said, 'Two months just to see a launch? That's weird.' They asked more and more questions,\" Casset said.\n\nElsewhere on the ranch, Yuen's 22-year-old son, Jax, helped craft a 30-foot-tall aluminum-tubing art installation that replicates the dimensions of a Starship nose cone. One of his personal highlights: Watching Mechazilla's chopsticks catch a Super Heavy booster for the first time in October 2024.\n\n\"It was pretty risky. And they did it. And had it gone wrong, then it would have destroyed the tower and there would be a major setback, maybe a year or something like that of progress. But they succeeded on their first try,\" Jax Yuen said.\n\n\"So history was made right here. And people all over the world were watching.\"\n\nFor the latest news from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and NASA's Kennedy Space Center, visit floridatoday.com/space.

The refuge has nearly 40,000 acres open for you to enjoy wildlife-related activities, including wildlife watching, hiking, and wildlife photography. And additional 6,000 acres are open to hunting.\nLocation and Contact Information\nAbout Us\nThe Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1979 with a management priority to protect biodiversity. As a wildlife corridor wildlife corridor\nTo maintain healthy species populations and ecosystems, fish and wildlife need the freedom to move and migrate. As habitats and migration routes are affected by climate change and fragmented by roads, fences, energy development and other man-made barriers, wildlife struggle to reach necessary areas to feed, breed and find shelter. A wildlife corridor is a piece of undeveloped land connecting two habitats so wildlife can move safely between them.\nLearn more about wildlife corridor , the refuge follows the Rio Grande along the last 275 river miles. It connects isolated tracts of land managed by private landowners, non-profit organizations, the State of Texas, and two other National Wildlife Refuges: Laguna Atascosa and Santa Ana.\nWhat We Do\nRefuges use a wide range of land management tools based on the best science available. Some refuges use prescribed fires to mimic natural fires that would have cleared old vegetation from the land helping native plants regenerate and local wildlife to thrive. Other refuges contain Wilderness areas where land is largely managed in passively. The management tools used are aimed at ensuring a balanced conservation approach where both wildlife and people will benefit.\nOur Species\nKnown as the lower Rio Grande Valley, the lower four counties of Texas contain a documented 1,200 plants, 300 butterflies, and approximately 700 vertebrates, of which at least 520 are birds. The Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge was established to protect this important biodiversity."

      "text": "SpaceX's Texas launch site is officially a new city called Starbase. What to know.\nTexas has a new city, largely thanks to Elon Musk's SpaceX.\nResidents in Cameron County, Texas, voted on May 3 to officially create Starbase, a new city along the state's southern border.\nThe area is home to SpaceX's rocket launch site and is where the company hopes to one day send humans to Mars. It's also slated to become the company's headquarters, Musk said in 2024.\nIn last weekend's election, a total of 218 votes were cast for the measure, with 212 opting to pass it, according to the Cameron County Elections Department. Most of the area's residents work for SpaceX, according to The New York Times.\n\"Starbase, Texas Is now a real city!\" Musk wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\nSpaceX did not respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.\nWhere is Starbase, Texas?\nThe newly formed city of Starbase is in Cameron County, Texas, about 22 miles east of Brownsville.\nThe area is along the southern perimeter of Texas and on the edge of the Mexico border. It consists of 220,000 square feet of buildings spread over 350 acres.\nMusk initially proposed creating the city in 2021. In December 2024, residents in the county submitted a petition calling for an election to incorporate the community of Starbase as a city.\nStarbase, TX, election results\nOf the 218 voters who cast ballots to officially form Starbase as a city, 212 chose to pass the measure while just six voted against it.\nWith the incorporation of Starbase, the area now has a city council, mayor and commissioners.\nVoters unanimously elected a mayor, Bobby Peden, who works for SpaceX, according to his LinkedIn profile.\nTwo newly elected commissioners \u2014 Jordan Buss and Jenna Petrzelka \u2014 have also worked for the company, according to their LinkedIn profiles.\nStarbase, TX, becomes new city. Why it matters\nSpaceX has not said why it wanted to form the town, but given it's home to many of its employees, the area's municipal government will likely work closely with the company.\n\"Becoming a city will help us continue building the best community possible for the men and women building the future of humanity's place in space,\" an X account for Starbase posted late Saturday.\nThe city houses a SpaceX landing pad, launch facility, launch control center and tracking station to test its rockets, including Starship, the most powerful launch vehicle ever developed, according to SpaceX.\nA $100 million five-story office building was also finished earlier this year, according to records from the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation.\nLast year, Musk also announced plans to move SpaceX's headquarters from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the SAFETY Act into law.\nContributing: USA TODAY's Rick Jervis\nMelina Khan is a trending reporter covering national news for USA TODAY. She can be reached at MKhan@gannett.com."

      "text": "SpaceX Starship-Super Heavy Project at Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A\nProject Updates\nProposed Action\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as the lead Federal agency is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of issuing a new of modifying an existing commercial launch vehicle operator license to SpaceX for the Starship-Super Heavy launch vehicle at Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida. SpaceX proposes to construct launch, landing, and other associated infrastructure at and in proximity to LC-39A. The proposal also includes Starship-Super Heavy launches at LC-39A; recoverable Super Heavy booster and Starship landings at LC-39A or on a droneship; and expendable Super Heavy booster and Starship landings in the ocean.\nSpaceX must obtain a new or modification of an existing vehicle operator license from the FAA for Starship-Super Heavy launch and landing operations. Issuance or modification of a vehicle operator license and approving airspace closures is considered a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). In consideration of SpaceX\u2019s revised proposal, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and FAA have determined that an EIS is the appropriate level of NEPA analysis to address the adjusted scope of Starship-Super Heavy at LC-39A. SpaceX has prepared the EIS under the supervision of the FAA which is serving as the lead agency at NASA\u2019s request. While the 2019 Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared by NASA provides an analytical baseline, the environmental impacts of these proposed changes to Starship-Super Heavy LC-39A development and operations will be specifically analyzed in this EIS.\nThe EIS considers the potential environmental impacts of the Proposed Action and the No Action Alternative. The successful completion of the environmental review process does not guarantee that the FAA would issue a new or modification of an existing vehicle operator license. The project must also meet all FAA safety, risk, and indemnification requirements for the appropriate license.\nDraft EIS\nThe FAA is releasing the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for SpaceX\u2019s proposed licensing and operation of the Starship Super-Heavy vehicle at Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) (Draft EIS). The National Aeronautics and Aerospace Administration (NASA), the Department of the Air Force (DAF), the United Stated Coast Guard (USCG), the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and the National Park Service (NPS) are cooperating agencies.\nThe Executive Summary of the Draft EIS is available below:\nThe Draft EIS and appendices are available below:\n- Draft Environmental Impact Statement\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix A \u2013 Public and Agency Involvement\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix B.1 \u2013 Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultation (US Fish and Wildlife Service) Part 1\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix B.1 \u2013 Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultation (US Fish and Wildlife Service) Part 2\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix B.1 \u2013 Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultation (US Fish and Wildlife Service) Part 3\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix B.2 \u2013 Essential Fish Habitat Assessment (National Marine Fisheries Service)\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix B.3 \u2013 National Historic Preservation Act Consultation Part 1\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix B.3 \u2013 National Historic Preservation Act Consultation Part 2\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix B.3 \u2013 National Historic Preservation Act Consultation Part 3\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix B.3 \u2013 National Historic Preservation Act Consultation Part 4\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix B.3 \u2013 National Historic Preservation Act Consultation Part 5\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix B.4 \u2013 Department of Transportation Act Section 4(f) Consultation\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix B.5 \u2013 Coastal Consistency Determination\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix B.6 \u2013 Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultation (National Marine Fisheries Service) Part 1\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix B.6 \u2013 Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultation (National Marine Fisheries Service) Part 2\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix B.6 \u2013 Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultation (National Marine Fisheries Service) Part 3\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix B.6 \u2013 Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultation (National Marine Fisheries Service) Part 4\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix B.7 \u2013 Marine Mammal Protection Act Incidental Harassment Authorization Application SpaceX Starship-Super Heavy Launch and Reentry\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix C.1 \u2013 Noise Report Part 1\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix C.1 \u2013 Noise Report Part 2\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix C.1 \u2013 Noise Report Part 3\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix C.1 \u2013 Noise Report Part 4\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix C.2 \u2013 Air Quality Part 1\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix C.2 \u2013 Air Quality Part 2\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix C.3 \u2013 Biological Resources Supplemental Information\n- Volume II \u2013 Appendix D \u2013 Applicable Regulations by Resource Area\nThe Draft EIS analyzes:\n- Up to 44 Starship-Super Heavy launches per year\n- Up to 44 Super Heavy landings per year, to include landings at LC-39A, landing on a droneship in the Atlantic Ocean, or expending in the Atlantic Ocean\n- Up to 44 Starship landings per year, to include landings at LC-39A, landing on a droneship in the Atlantic Ocean, or soft-water or hard-water landing with expending or recovery in the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, or Indian Ocean\n- Construction of launch, landing, and other associated infrastructure at and in proximity to LC-39A.\nProviding Public Comments\nThe FAA invites interested parties to submit comments on the Draft EIS.

Members of the public can also provide written comments at one of the commenting stations.\nDuring the virtual meeting, the FAA will provide a pre-recorded presentation during the first half hour of the public meeting. The public can provide oral comments for up to three minutes during the virtual meeting. A moderator will facilitate verbal comments.\nIf any accommodation for the public meetings is needed (such as translation services), please submit a request by August 14, 2025 to the project email address: SpaceXStarship39AEIS@icf.com.\nAll public meeting materials are available to view or download below.\n- Public Meeting Presentation Slides\n- Public In-person Meeting Informational Boards\n- Public In-person Meeting Informational Handout\nScoping Period\nThe FAA published the Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of issuing a commercial launch vehicle operator license to SpaceX for the Starship-Super Heavy launch vehicle at LC-39A at KSC, Florida on May 10, 2024, on the Federal Register.\nPublication of the NOI initiated the public scoping period. The FAA invited interested agencies, organizations, Native American Tribes, and members of the public to submit comments to inform the FAA on the significant issues to be analyzed in depth in the EIS (e.g., range of actions, alternatives, environmental impacts).\nAll comments received were posted without change to https://www.regulations.gov docket number FAA-2024-1395. The public scoping period ended on June 24, 2024. All comments will receive the same attention and consideration in the preparation of the EIS.\nThe FAA held three in-person scoping meetings and one virtual public scoping meeting. The meetings allowed the public to receive information on the Proposed Action, meet lead and cooperating agency representatives, and provide comments to the record. The in-person public meetings were held on June 12, 2024 and June 13,2024. The virtual public meeting was held on June 17, 2024.\nProject Background\nWhen fully operational, SpaceX proposes that the Starship-Super Heavy launch vehicle will offer a heavy lift platform that expands the company\u2019s ability to execute the totality of its current and expected future customers\u2019 requirements. By providing a reusable launch vehicle, SpaceX proposes that the Starship-Super Heavy would deliver efficient access to space and enable cost-effective delivery of cargo and people to the moon and Mars. Currently, SpaceX is conducting flight tests of the Starship-Super Heavy at Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, an exclusive use launch site that serves as SpaceX\u2019s primary research, development, and flight test launch facility for the vehicle.\nIn September 2019, the NASA completed the Final Environmental Assessment for the SpaceX Starship and Super Heavy Launch Vehicle at KSC (\u201c2019 EA\u201d) to evaluate the potential environmental impacts resulting from construction and operations associated with utilization of LC-39A for the SpaceX Starship-Super Heavy launch vehicle in practical applications. LC-39A is a SpaceX-leased launch site located on northern KSC property and currently supports SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches.\nWithin the context of the 2019 EA, the scope of the Proposed Action was defined as infrastructure development and Starship-Super Heavy operations. Infrastructure development included construction of a launch mount, liquid methane farm, transport road, deluge water system, landing zone, and high-pressure gaseous commodity lines. Operations involved approximately 24 Starship-Super Heavy launches per year. NASA\u2019s resultant Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) issued on September 19, 2019, concluded that the environmental impacts associated with Starship-Super Heavy infrastructure development and operations would not individually or cumulatively have a significant impact on the quality of the biological or physical environment. SpaceX did not submit a vehicle operator license application for the Starship-Super Heavy launch operations at LC-39A subsequent to the completion of the 2019 EA; therefore, the FAA did not have a federal action to adopt NASA\u2019s EA/FONSI.\nWhile the purpose and need for Starship-Super Heavy at LC-39A have not changed since the 2019 EA, the Starship-Super Heavy concept of operations has evolved from the original 2019 EA scope. SpaceX now proposes to construct additional launch infrastructure not previously contemplated in the 2019 EA; launch an advanced design of the Starship and Super Heavy vehicle; operate at a projected higher launch tempo; and land the Super Heavy booster at LC-39A in support of the reusability concept. Starship landings are no longer proposed to occur at Landing Zone 1 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\nStay Informed\nSubscribe to our mailing list to receive updates on this project.

      "text": "'A different breed': SpaceX's sprawling Starbase still rising from South Texas sand flats\n- SpaceX's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, a remote and active launch site, is preparing for its 10th Starship test flight.\n- Starbase's proximity to the public and unique operational style contrast with other launch facilities like those in Florida.\n- The FAA will hold public meetings in Florida to address environmental concerns regarding SpaceX's proposed Starship launches from Kennedy Space Center.\nBOCA CHICA, TEXAS \u2014 Mirages shimmered across the sand flats amid the 95-degree South Texas sun approaching SpaceX's sprawling Starbase, where a huge Starship rocket and two Super Heavy boosters loomed on the horizon like a setting from a \"Dune\" movie.\nVehicles jounce eastward toward Starbase along sparsely populated Boca Chica Boulevard, the lone two-lane road leading from \"civilization\" near Brownsville to SpaceX's isolated Starship operations nearly a half-hour away. Years of heavy construction-truck traffic headed to SpaceX's futuristic facilities battered this asphalt into long stretches of shock-absorber-pounding patched potholes.\nPerhaps America's oddest drive to the beach, motorists navigate the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge's scenic scrubby flats, flocks of birds and patches of cacti before abruptly driving right up to the Starship-Super Heavy \"rocket garden\" staging area and production site.\nThen the road winds past SpaceX's newly built black-glass-walled offices and Starfactory \u2014 which could fit 15 football fields inside \u2014 before ending at the dune line near Starship's soaring twin launch towers. One is the chopstick-equipped Mechazilla, which is designed to catch descending Super Heavy boosters in midair.\n\"Coming out here is a different breed. You've got to be tough to be here,\" said Jack Yuen, founder of the nonprofit Maker SpaceX Boca Chica and leader of the Mars Society's Brownsville/Starbase chapter.\n\"Hanging out in Florida: 'Oh, I feel like going to Disney, I feel like going to this bar, I feel like going here, this nightclub.' You can't do that here,\" Yuen said.\nSpaceX's remote coastal launch site about 2.2 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border has hosted nine Starship test flights since April 2023, capturing worldwide media attention. Yuen said all Starship missions look different, a stark contrast to the practically routine rocket liftoffs from Florida's Space Coast. That's where 70 orbital launches have already occurred thus far this year.\nThe last three Starship rockets broke apart and exploded during test flights earlier this year, while another blew up during a June engine test at Starbase's Massey's site, a former gun range off Boca Chica Boulevard.\n\"After we waited for two years with no launch, it goes up. It's like a good-sized skyscraper \u2014 not a small skyscraper, but a good-sized skyscraper. It went up, and it was crooked,\" Yuen recalled of Starship's April 2023 maiden flight, holding out his cell phone pointed askew.\n\"And everybody was afraid that the darn thing was going to explode. So it didn't explode; it did knock out a lot of concrete that was underneath it. But it went up crooked, and it kept on going up,\" Yuen said.\nThat inaugural Starship-Super Heavy tandem did end up exploding nearly four minutes after liftoff during \"a rapid unscheduled disassembly,\" SpaceX reported. Now on Sunday, SpaceX crews will target Starship's 10th flight test during an hourlong launch window extending from 7:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. EST.\nDuring his State of the City Address in March, Brownsville Mayor John Cowen Jr. said SpaceX employed more than 2,100 local workers and invested more than $3 billion in Starbase. Next, the colossal Starship-Super Heavy rocket system is coming to NASA's Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\nFlorida officials project the Starship program will generate at least $1.8 billion in capital investment and 600 new full-time jobs on the Space Coast by 2030. Already under construction at the Cape: a Gigabay standing 380 feet tall and housing about 46.5 million cubic feet of interior processing space with 815,000 square feet of workspace.\nBut Yuen views today's flight-test days as merely \"an emerging space thing\" during SpaceX's march to the moon, Mars and a science fiction-like era of space travel. Under the direction of founding billionaire Elon Musk, SpaceX aims to someday build up to 1,000 Starships in Texas per year, with the rockets designed to transport up to 100 people on long-duration interplanetary treks.\n\"Thirty or 40 years from now, they're going to be having launches every day. All the buildings that are built will be tossed aside,\" Yuen said of Starbase.\n\"This is going to be like 'Star Wars' going on here. That's what I think's going to happen,\" Yuen said.\nFAA to host Florida meetings on Starship environmental impacts\nAt KSC, SpaceX seeks Federal Aviation Administration licensing approval to soon launch up to 44 Starship-Super Heavy rocket-booster tandems per year from pad 39A.\nAnd social media chatter continues growing in opposition to SpaceX's proposal to periodically close access to Playalinda Beach and Canaveral National Seashore for security purposes, starting about three hours prior to those Starship launches.\nSpaceX's KSC proposal also includes up to 44 Super Heavy booster landings and up to 44 Starship landings per year. Landings would occur at pad 39A, atop a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean, or into the sea in expendable fashion. Starship landings could also happen in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, with some missions aimed at post-splashdown recovery.\nNext week, FAA officials will collect comments on Starship environmental impacts during four public meetings at two Brevard County locations:\n- Tuesday, Aug. 26: 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Astronauts Memorial Foundation Center for Space Education at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.\n- Thursday, Aug. 28: 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Radisson Resort at the Port, 8701 Astronaut Blvd., Cape Canaveral.\nA virtual meeting will also occur from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Sept. 3. Comments can also be submitted online at regulations.gov.\nThe FAA's most conservative estimate projects 33 to 44 full-day closures and up to 33 half-day closures per year, totaling the equivalent of 60\u00bd days. But scrubs and weather delays would increase those totals.\nA judge in Cameron County, Texas, has ordered Boca Chica Beach and more than 14 miles of Boca Chica Boulevard to close from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. CST Sunday for Starship flight-testing activities and the launch attempt.\nThe Sierra Club, Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe of Texas and environmental group SaveRGV are suing Texas officials for closing Boca Chica Beach for SpaceX operations, saying the closures are unconstitutional. In a March letter to Texas Senate officials, Sierra Club officials said they expect the case to advance all the way to the Texas Supreme Court.\nFully stacked, the two-stage Starship system (a 171-foot Starship atop a 232-foot Super Heavy Booster) stands 403 feet tall. In terms of scale in downtown Melbourne, that's like stacking Trinity Towers West (175 feet), Trinity Towers East (145 feet) and the Highline apartment complex (96 feet) on top of each other. Those three buildings total 416 feet in height.\nDuring an Aug. 7 media roundtable, United Launch Alliance President and CEO Tory Bruno noted that Starship measures \"much larger than a Saturn V.\"\n\"Starship is an interesting vehicle, in that it's not just another rocket on the range. It is of an unprecedented size,\" Bruno told reporters.\n\"The request that has been put in for the licenses (is) at a very, very high launch rate. So we are counting on the Space Force and the FAA to do a very thorough analysis of that, and how it will affect not just the ecological environment but also the launch environment,\" he said, citing operational impacts on other Eastern Range launch providers.\nWorld's biggest rocket attracts Texas supporters\nThe obvious parallel to Starbase on Florida's Space Coast is Blue Origin's tremendous, ever-expanding New Glenn rocket factory, which sprawls off Space Commerce Way just south of the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.\nMotorists can drive past and gawk at the complex of huge blue buildings across more than 230 acres. But Blue Origin's massive New Glenn rockets \u2014 which measure taller than a football field \u2014 are rarely visible outside the factory.\nNeither is the company's launch tower. Blue Origin sends New Glenns into flight from Launch Complex 36, a $1 billion-plus rebuilt liftoff site shielded far from the public behind the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station security gates. By contrast, Starbase's nearest launch tower stands about \u2155-mile from a public beach.\n\"It is unprecedented,\" Alexandre Casset, a 24-year-old French engineering student pursing a doctorate degree, said of Starbase. \"You can't do that with Blue Origin, ULA and all these companies. They don't allow people to go that close to the actual launch sites.\"\nCasset, who dreams of working for SpaceX someday, and Yuen embody a comparitively small but growing space-centric community in nearby Brownsville and South Padre Island. Generations of residents are accustomed to spaceflight in the Cape Canaveral area, where missiles and rockets have taken flight since July 1950. Conversely, SpaceX's rapid, disruptive Texas growth has created tension among local residents, Yuen said, bumping his fists together.\nYuen has served as a South Texas SpaceX public ambassador. In March 2021, he and his family were introduced to the area while camping for 12 days in a Mercedes Sprinter van while waiting to watch a Starship prototype launch from Isla Blanca Park on South Padre Island.\nThat June, he and his wife, Helen, bought a rural 13-acre ranch located about 17 miles from Starbase. She coins the property \"the landing pad\" \u2014 current and future SpaceX engineers have stayed there, while hundreds of space enthusiasts have visited.\nYuen founded MSX Boca Chica as part of the \"maker movement\" that promotes do-it-yourself engineering and creativity. SpaceX engineers designed a rock-climbing wall inside his ranch warehouse, and equipment lies everywhere for welding, plasma cutting, 3D printing and electrical projects.\nIn April 2022, MSX Boca Chica organized a \"Starbase Tailgate V1\" rally alongside the rocket factory to show support for SpaceX from Rio Grande Valley residents. A couple hundred people attended the rally. Some wore chrome alien helmets with black visors. Others waved SpaceX flags and handwritten signs.\nThat 2022 event took place about \u00bd-mile down Boca Chica Boulevard from Boca Chica Village. The village is now a newly incorporated, secretive SpaceX company town mostly inhabited by employees that was created in May via a 212-6 vote. This rapidly expanding housing area with tiny homes and travel trailers alongside Starfactory generated controversy with a plan to restrict public access via roadway gates.\nFLORIDA TODAY sent messages seeking comment from SpaceX, Starbase's city administrator and city clerk, and its three elected officials: Mayor Bobby Peden (SpaceX's vice president of Texas Test and Launch), Commissioner Jordan Buss (SpaceX's senior director of environmental, health and safety) and Commissioner Jenna Petrzelka (who served as Space's manager of operations engineering at Starbase). No messages were returned.\nBack at the MSX Boca Chica ranch, Casset has occupied a bed in a corner since July 2 while awaiting the next Starship launch. He flew to Texas from Europe, and he laughed while recalling the two rounds of questioning he received from international customs personnel at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.\n\"I was specific. The first question they asked was, 'What will you do during these two months in the U.S.?' I said, 'I will watch a SpaceX launch in Brownsville.' And they said, 'Two months just to see a launch? That's weird.' They asked more and more questions,\" Casset said.\nElsewhere on the ranch, Yuen's 22-year-old son, Jax, helped craft a 30-foot-tall aluminum-tubing art installation that replicates the dimensions of a Starship nose cone. One of his personal highlights: Watching Mechazilla's chopsticks catch a Super Heavy booster for the first time in October 2024.\n\"It was pretty risky. And they did it. And had it gone wrong, then it would have destroyed the tower and there would be a major setback, maybe a year or something like that of progress. But they succeeded on their first try,\" Jax Yuen said.\n\"So history was made right here. And people all over the world were watching.\"\nFor the latest news from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and NASA's Kennedy Space Center, visit floridatoday.com/space.

      "text": "Elon Musk wants SpaceX Starship to send 1st humans to Mars. Here's how it could happen\nStarship, which SpaceX has launched on nine flight tests from Starbase in South Texas, is the centerpiece of Elon Musk's plan to establish a city on Mars in a matter of years.\nThe idea that humans could one day populate and even colonize Mars is one no longer confined to the realm of science fiction.\nAstronauts are on the cusp in the years ahead of journeying all the way to the Red Planet, where so far only rovers and orbiters have dared to venture. And when they do, it's likely they'll make landfall aboard a SpaceX Starship.\nBillionaire Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the vision of paving the way to create a self-sustaining colony on the Red Planet. By April 2023, the company rolled out its massive Starship \u2013 the rocket/spacecraft combo designed to reach Mars \u2013 to its South Texas launch pad for what would be its first of nine flight tests to date.\nWhile Starship has endured a few explosive setbacks in 2025, SpaceX is preparing for a mission it refers to as flight 10 as early as Sunday, Aug. 24 to get the vehicle's development back on track. But Starship has a long way to go before it can carry the first spacefarers to Mars and fulfill Musk's long-held dream of \"making life multiplanetary.\"\nHere's everything to know about Elon Musk's goal of colonizing Mars, and how Starship, which could soon fly again for the first time since May 27, fits in to those plans.\nWhy is Elon Musk interested in sending Starship to Mars?\nMusk, who has often spoken publicly about his Mars vision, delivered his latest public updates in late May in front of employees from Starbase, SpaceX's headquarters 180 miles south of Corpus Christi that recently became its own Texas city.\nIn a video SpaceX shared May 29 on social media site X, which Musk owns, the world's richest man described to his employees the goal of sending humans to Mars as essential \u201cfor the long term survival of civilization.\" Under Musk's vision, humans would not just step on the planet before departing, but would remain to establish a settlement that could function independently if any cataclysmic event were to ever happen on Earth.\nSo, why Mars, as opposed to, say, Jupiter or Venus?\nWell, while other planets in our solar system are anything but habitable for humans, Mars gets a decent amount of sunlight, has water sources and is already a planet where humanity has sent robotic rovers to scout the terrain. At an average distance of 140 million miles from Earth, it's also one of our closest cosmic neighbors.\nWhile Mars has a thin atmosphere and is relatively cold, SpaceX claims on its website, \"we can warm it up.\"\nGravity on Mars is about 38% of that of Earth's, meaning humans would be able to lift heavier objects and bound around.\nWhat is Starship? World' largest rocket developed for travel to Mars\nSpaceX is developing Starship specifically with a Martian destination in mind. The spacecraft is designed to be a fully reusable transportation system, meaning the rocket and vehicle can return to the ground for additional missions.\nThe Starship, standing 403 feet tall when fully stacked, is regarded as the world\u2019s largest and most powerful launch vehicle ever developed. When fully integrated, the launch system is composed of both a 232-foot Super Heavy rocket and the 171-foot upper stage Starship itself, the spacecraft where crew and cargo would ride.\nSuper Heavy alone is powered by 33 of SpaceX\u2019s Raptor engines that give the initial burst of thrust at liftoff. The upper stage Starship section is powered by six Raptor engines that will ultimately travel in orbit.\nWhen could SpaceX launch Starship to Mars?\nMusk wants to send the first uncrewed Starship to Mars by the end of 2026 for a very critical reason: The timeline coincides with an orbital alignment around the sun that would shorten the journey between Earth and Mars.\nIt's a slim window that occurs once about every two years, and if SpaceX misses it, Musk has said the company would target another mission during the next alignment. If Starship were to blast off for the Red Planet by the end of 2026, the journey itself would take between seven to nine months.\nWhile no humans would have a seat on the first flight to Mars, Starship won't be empty. Instead, the vehicle would carry one or more Optimus robots designed and built by Tesla, Musk's electric vehicle company.\nWhere, how would Starship land on Mars?\nStarship would enter Mars' atmosphere while zooming at 4.6 miles per second before it begins decelerating. The vehicle's heatshield is designed to withstand multiple atmospheric entries, but the Martian environment is expected to be harsher on the spacecraft, given its higher levels of atomic oxygen in the atmosphere, according to SpaceX.\nSpaceX is still considering multiple potential landing sites on Mars for Starship, but the leading contender appears to be a region known as Arcadia. The volcanic plain is on Mars' northern hemisphere far from the planet's frigid poles, with access to water sources in the form of shallow ice.\nArcadia is also flat enough to make landings and takeoffs relatively safer, Musk has said.\nWhat happens when the first humans arrive on Mars?\nCrewed trips with humans would then follow most likely in the early 2030s, Musk has claimed.\nMusk said he envisions eventually launching 1,000 to 2,000 Starships to Mars every two years so enough people and supplies can make it to the surface to quickly establish a livable, self-sufficient city.\nAchieving that goal would require more than 1 million Martian residents and millions of tons of cargo, according to SpaceX. For that reason, the company has an ambitious target of one day in the years ahead launching Starship more than 10 times per day from Earth to Mars during those crucial transfer windows every 26 months.\nThe first humans on Mars would be tasked with taking account of local resources, setting up landing operations, establishing a power source and building homes.\nHow does Musk's vision fit in Trump's, align with NASA's Artemis campaign?\nNASA also has designs on astronauts reaching Mars \u2013 even if the agency's plan of attack differs from Musk's.\nStarship is crucial to the U.S. space agency's goal of returning astronauts to the moon's surface for the first time in five decades. NASA's lunar exploration plans call for Artemis III astronauts aboard the Orion capsule to board the Starship while in orbit for a ride to the moon's surface as early as 2027.\nOnce NASA has established a basecamp on the lunar south pole in the years ahead, the agency envisions sending humans from the moon on to Mars.\nMusk, though, has long favored a more aggressive Earth-to-Mars approach.\nPresident Donald Trump also outlined in his January inauguration speech his intent for humans to \"plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars\" during his second term \u2013 a vision from which he hasn't appeared to waver even after a public spat with Musk in June.\nWhile Trump has proposed a significant 25% slash to NASA's overall budget, the cuts mostly target the space agency's science programs while increasing funding for space exploration \u2013 including missions to Mars. The White House's 2026 budget proposal calls for allocating more than $1 billion for Mars exploration, while an additional $10 billion in funding for NASA was included in Republican spending legislation known as the One Big Beautiful Bill.\nTrump also signed earlier in August an executive order aimed at rolling back federal regulations on commercial spaceflight companies, including SpaceX. The move came a few months after the Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, gave approval in May for SpaceX to conduct as many as 25 Starship test flights a year as Musk seeks to ramp up development of the Mars-bound spacecraft.\nWhen is the next Starship launch from Starbase, Texas?\nSpaceX plans to conduct the 10th flight test of its Starship spacecraft Sunday, Aug. 24, with a target liftoff time of 6:30 p.m. CT the company's Starbase headquarters in Cameron County, about 23 miles from Brownsville.\nEric Lagatta is the Space Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

      "text": "SpaceX, Starship and 'Gigabay' in Florida: About Elon Musk's plans for the massive rocket\nStarship is on the verge of flying for the first time in more than two months over Texas, but SpaceX's massive rocket could also soon be soaring above Florida.\nThat's right: A gigantic launch system vehicle that has only ever lifted off from SpaceX's Starbase in Texas could operate out of the Sunshine State. Plans call for billionaire Elon Musk's commercial spaceflight company to bring Starship production and launch capabilities to the Space Coast \u2013 potentially by the end of the year.\nAs SpaceX breaks ground in Florida on a new Starship facility it calls \"Gigabay,\" the company is also finalizing plans to launch the 400-foot-tall spacecraft from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. The moves come as SpaceX seeks regulatory approval to commence conducting Starship flight tests at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and Kennedy Space Center.\nWhy? For SpaceX and Musk, expanding Starship operations to a second state is crucial to accelerate the development of a vehicle that has encountered unexpected setbacks as it undergoes tests for future human missions to both the moon and Mars.\nAs SpaceX prepres to launch Starship on its 10th test flight since April 2023 from Texas, here's what to know about the company's future plans for Florida.\nFlorida rocket launches: Vacationing in Florida and want to catch a rocket launch? Here\u2019s what to know\nWhen is the next Starship launch from Texas?\nSpaceX has not yet announced an official target liftoff date for the company's next Starship test, which will once again occur at its Starbase headquarters in South Texas. But Musk has suggested in a post on X that the launch could occur in August.\nSpaceX recently conducted a \"static fire\" engine trial with the Starship spacecraft's upper stage by briefly igniting one of the vehicle's six Raptor engines, the company said Thursday, July 31, in a post on social media site X. The engine firing demonstration came a few days after SpaceX moved and fully stacked the Starship vehicle at its launch site ahead of pre-flight testing.\nWhen could Starship launch from Florida?\nSpaceX has long had plans in place to build a Starship launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center near Cape Canaveral and at Launch Complex 37 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\nAt the Kennedy Space Center, the site is located at the historic launch complex 39A \u2013 the site of the U.S. space agency's Apollo moon mission launches.\nSpaceX would not only equip the sites to launch Starship, but to catch its Super Heavy rocket booster when it returns to the pads \u2013 as it has done three times at Starbase.\nIn its March update on the project, SpaceX said it had begun building and installing the pad\u2019s deflector system at the Kennedy Space Center, which provides cooling and sound suppression water during launches.\nPending completion of environmental reviews, SpaceX has said it intends to conduct Starship's first Florida launch by the end of 2025.\nWhat is Gigabay? SpaceX's plans for Space Coast, Florida, launch\nUltimately, though, SpaceX has ambitious plans for the construction of its 380-foot-tall Gigabay in Florida.\nThe massive building, which will be used to stack and finalize the 232-foot-tall Super Heavy boosters, or lower stages, with the Starship vehicle before flights, is under construction near SpaceX\u2019s facility on Kennedy Space Center grounds. When completed, Gigabay is planned to be 815,000 square feet of workspace, including a ground level, elevated platform work areas, and a work and meeting space on the top floor, according to SpaceX.\n\"Site preparations for Gigabay in Florida have already begun, with construction targeted to be complete and the facility operational by the end of 2026,\" SpaceX has said.\nSpaceX is also eyeing plans for a manufacturing facility on the same site to enable production of Starships in Florida. In the meantime, the company will transport completed Super Heavy boosters and Starship upper stage ships from Starbase on barges.\nPublic hearings in Florida take place over SpaceX's Starship plans\nIn the meantime, Florida residents still have the opportunity to provide public feedback as officials consider granting regulatory approval to SpaceX's proposed plans.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, announced Aug. 4 that the public has until Sept. 22 to submit online comments. The agency is also hosting a series of three public meetings \u2013 two in person and one virtually \u2013 between Aug. 26 and Sept. 3.\nThis is not the first time public hearings have been scheduled to take place regarding plans for 44 potential Starship launches from the Kennedy Space Center.\nU.S. Air Force officials also recently provided a chance for feedback on potential environmental impacts from up to 76 future Starship-Super Heavy rocket systems launching per year from the neighboring Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\nWhile some residents have expressed concerns about the effect Starship launches could have on the environment and local wildlife, Florida officials have estimated that the endeavor could generate at least $1.8 billion of capital investment and about 600 new full-time jobs by 2030.\nEnvironmental impact statements are underway for both potential launch sites.\nWhat is Starship?\nThe Starship, standing nearly 400 feet tall when fully stacked, is regarded as the world\u2019s largest and most powerful launch vehicle ever developed.\nWhen fully integrated, the launch system is composed of both a 232-foot Super Heavy rocket and the 171-foot upper stage Starship itself, the spacecraft where crew and cargo would ride.\nSpaceX is developing Starship to be a fully reusable transportation system, meaning both the rocket and vehicle can return to the ground for additional missions.\nNASA's delayed lunar exploration plans call for Artemis III astronauts aboard the Orion capsule to board the Starship while in orbit for a ride to the moon's surface.\nBut Musk is more preoccupied with Starship reaching Mars \u2013 potentially, he has claimed, by the end of 2026. Under his vision, human expeditions aboard the Starship could then follow in the years after the first uncrewed spacecraft reaches the Red Planet.\nThis article originally appeared on Florida Today: When will SpaceX rocket Starship launch in Florida, info about Gigabay"
