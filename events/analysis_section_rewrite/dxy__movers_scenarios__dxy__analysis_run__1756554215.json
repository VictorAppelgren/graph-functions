      "feedback": "The draft fails the required format and clarity: each line must be a single sentence with the exact fields “Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %”; the current items miss the “What to watch” field, mix outcomes with triggers, and lack inline citations. Rewrite each line as a concise, one‑sentence statement, e.g.:  \n\n**Up | Aug 30–31 | Fed policy shift | PCE > 3 % | 14 % (7XH2DKEKV)**  \n**Up | Aug 30–31 | Yield‑curve flattening | 2‑yr/10‑yr spread < 30 bp | 14 % (7XH2DKEKV)**  \n**Down | Aug 30–31 | Fed rate‑cut expectations | 2‑yr/10‑yr spread > 50 bp | 86 % (7XH2DKEKV)**  \n**Down | Aug 30–31 | Cook lawsuit unresolved | Trump‑linked political pressure | 70 % (Z7O1DCHS7)**  \n\nEnsure each driver is a clear causal link to the DXY, each “What to watch” is a specific event (not an outcome), and the probability reflects the cited source. Remove any filler or redundant phrasing, keep the asset implicit but consistent, and verify that the probability percentages sum to a realistic range (e.g., 86 % down vs. 14 % up). This will satisfy the 4‑item, 1‑sentence, fully cited requirement.",
