      "feedback": "The draft is off‑track – it concentrates on the S&P 500 while the SECTION FOCUS demands a 3–6 month view of the U.S. dollar (DXY) and its drivers. Every sentence that references equity indices, tech earnings, or the S&P 500 should be removed or rewritten to tie back to the dollar. Re‑frame the narrative around the following pillars:\n\n1. **Dollar‑Fed nexus** – Map the Fed’s September rate‑cut expectations to a 0.5–1.0 % DXY depreciation over the next 3–6 months, citing the September payrolls (ID Z7O1DCHS7) and Fed minutes (ID Z7O1DCHS7).  \n2. **Inflation & tariff impact** – Quantify how sticky CPI (2.7 % YoY) and tariff‑driven price pressures could keep the Fed funds target above 5 % for longer, pushing the DXY higher by 0.3–0.6 % (ID FAN5RYW6T).  \n3. **Mortgage‑related consumer squeeze** – Link rising ARM rates (4.39 % SOFR‑linked) to reduced discretionary spending, compressing U.S. consumer‑cyclical earnings and weakening the dollar’s risk‑off appeal (ID KX6AOMQZ5).  \n4. **Catalyst timeline** – September payrolls (5 Sept), Fed policy statement (mid‑Sept), November PCE (late Oct), Q4 earnings (Nov–Dec).  \n5. **Magnitude & confidence** – Base case: DXY down 1.5–2.5 % (≈ 30–50 bp per month) if the Fed cuts and inflation moderates; upside: 0.5–1.0 % if inflation stays sticky; downside: 2–3 % if rate cuts stall or tariffs intensify. Confidence: moderate‑high, but watch for Fed’s independence narrative (ID Z7O1DCHS7).  \n\nRemove all S&P 500–specific language, replace it with dollar‑centric metrics, and ensure each claim is tied to a canonical handle (DXY, USDJPY, USDCNH) with a clear causal chain and dated catalyst.",
