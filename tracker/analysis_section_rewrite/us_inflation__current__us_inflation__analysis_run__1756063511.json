      "feedback": "Refactor into a tight, source-grounded 0–3 week frame that makes the causal chain explicit and testable. Actions: (1) Define an explicit base-case: tariff policy remains at 15% (after the recent cut from 27.5%), with pass-through to auto prices observable in the next 2–3 weeks via auto-pricing signals and manufacturers’ commentary (S15934PBQ; Nikkei data cited in S15934PBQ); tie to consumer inflation expectations and short‑horizon rate/credit signals (U6HXAJR4J). (2) Quantify key numeric anchors and align figures across sources: Toyota NA operating income swing to a $-438m loss (S15934PBQ) against a $5.8b quarterly profit elsewhere, and ongoing price/pass-through dynamics; EV depreciation notes (CDBMWIUTB) and the five-year depreciation picture from the “worst brands” piece (Scraped Source 3) to calibrate downside risk to new-vehicle demand. For Bethel, anchor with Bethel housing data: median price about $582k–$583k and ~5% affordable stock (F8GF45MEU; 6OOEK8TUR); market tightness signals from Redfin (6OOEK8TUR). For Las Vegas, use the reported price inflation in food/drink/services and the resulting tourism drag as a near-term demand shock (6OOEK8TUR). (3) sharpen the causal chain: tariffs raise auto costs → some passthrough to U.S. buyers, not fully offset → higher financed‑car payments and slower new‑car demand; central‑bank credibility (Lagarde) supports a predictable risk‑pricing backdrop, reducing the odds of abrupt policy reversals (U6HXAJR4J); local housing friction under 8‑30g adds noise to credit/consumption in housing‑related spend (F8GF45MEU). (4) specify near-term catalysts and invalidation: primary catalysts are (a) any tariff escalation/relief news (0–3 weeks) and actual price pass‑through data; (b) 8‑30g litigation outcomes or compromises in Bethel; (c) Vegas pricing/tourism indicators and discretionary-spending signals; (d) any fresh auto‑pricing commentary from Japanese OEMs. Invalidation triggers include tariff reversal back toward 27.5% or evidence of materially cooler auto inflation than implied, a favorable housing policy resolution that reduces expected credit tightness, or a sudden shift in Lagarde/Powell messaging that meaningfully alters rate paths. (5) restructure the write‑up to a compact, four‑part template: immediate drivers, near-term catalysts, transmission function (pricing/credit/consumption), and monitoring thresholds. Ensure every assertion ties to a cited ID, and add a concise “watch list” with 2–3 concrete triggers (tariff datapoint, Bethel 8‑30g status, Las Vegas price/visitor metrics, EV depreciation signal). (6) Reconcile conflicts explicitly in note form: note that some sources frame tariff pass-through as seasonal rather than tariff-driven (S15934PBQ vs. Nikkei framing) and that EV depreciation signals are mixed across outlets; hedge by emphasizing observable price data and policy cues over model‑based inferences. Output should remain a concise, source‑paired paragraph with clear application to pricing/consumption paths. Citations to include in final: (S15934PBQ)(U6HXAJR4J)(CDBMWIUTB)(F8GF45MEU)(6OOEK8TUR).",
