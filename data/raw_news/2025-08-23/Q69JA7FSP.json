  "title": "Analysts Have Made A Financial Statement On Skellerup Holdings Limited's (NZSE:SKL) Full-Year Report",
  "description": "It's been a good week for Skellerup Holdings Limited ( NZSE:SKL ) shareholders, because the company has just released...",
  "content": "It's been a good week for Skellerup Holdings Limited (NZSE:SKL) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest yearly results, and the shares gained 4.6% to NZ$5.00. Results overall were respectable, with statutory earnings of NZ$0.28 per share roughly in line with what the analysts had forecast. Revenues of NZ$353m came in 2.1% ahead of analyst predictions. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Skellerup Holdings from two analysts is for revenues of NZ$383.4m in 2026. If met, it would imply a solid 8.5% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to accumulate 6.4% to NZ$0.30. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of NZ$377.3m and earnings per share (EPS) of NZ$0.31 in 2026. So it looks like there's been a small decline in overall sentiment after the recent results - there's been no major change to revenue estimates, but the analysts did make a minor downgrade to their earnings per share forecasts.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Skellerup Holdings\n\nThe consensus price target held steady at NZ$5.63, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future.\n\nAnother way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. The analysts are definitely expecting Skellerup Holdings' growth to accelerate, with the forecast 8.5% annualised growth to the end of 2026 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 6.0% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue shrink 8.2% per year. So it's clear with the acceleration in growth, Skellerup Holdings is expected to grow meaningfully faster than the wider industry.\n\nThe biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for Skellerup Holdings. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Their estimates also suggest that Skellerup Holdings' revenue is expected to perform better than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at NZ$5.63, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.",

  "argos_summary": "Skellerup Holdings Limited reported a solid year with earnings per share of NZ$0.28 and revenue of NZ$353m, slightly above analyst expectations, leading to a 4.6% share price rise. Analysts now forecast 2026 revenue of NZ$383.4m and EPS of NZ$0.30, a modest downgrade in EPS outlook but unchanged revenue guidance, and maintain a price target of NZ$5.63. The company\u2019s growth is projected to accelerate at 8.5% annually, outpacing the broader New Zealand machinery sector, which is expected to shrink 8.2% per year. Despite a slight earnings downgrade, Skellerup\u2019s strong financial health, low debt, and dividend increases keep it attractive to investors, with a 5\u2011year return of 82.48% and a stable volatility profile.",
