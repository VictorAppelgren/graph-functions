  "title": "The intranet dilemma: bridging IT and communications for a better employee experience",
  "description": "Bridging IT and comms for better intranets",
  "content": "Having been in the corporate communications industry for the past 25 years and for the past decade in communications technology, my career calling has been to bridge the gap that exists in so many organizations between those professionals working in IT and those in Communications.\n\nMy point of view \u2013 IT and Communications professionals have unique and important skill sets that are each critical to the success of the companies they work for. Nevertheless, a need for greater collaboration and mutual respect between the two is required for the sake of one \u2013 the employee.\n\nOne area where this partnership is especially critical is in the decision-making around a company\u2019s corporate intranet. This digital hub is the technological glue that binds an organization whether it be a few hundred or hundreds of thousands of employees. It is the first thing employees see each day\u2014a launchpad to news, tools, resources, collaboration spaces, and more.\n\nWhen done well, it reinforces culture and streamlines work. When done poorly, it becomes a graveyard of outdated documents, unread announcements and broken links.\n\nTraditionally, intranets have \u201clived\u201d under IT and have been paid for through IT budgets. This makes sense from a technical standpoint. Intranets require software, servers, authentication, security and support. But the intranet is no longer just a technical utility\u2014it\u2019s a strategic communications platform.\n\nThere are various vendors offering modern intranet solutions. Some focus exclusively on the mobile experience and employee apps; others are desktop-only. Some offer integrated communications platforms that unify desktop, mobile, email, digital signage, SMS, etc. and are designed to reduce redundancy, improve content delivery across channels and save money.\n\nThis begs the question \u2013 who should make the intranet software buying decision? Communications professionals are often more familiar with the emerging tools that impacts the work they do, especially when it comes to creating and managing a meaningful employee experience. Since the employee is at the core of the work that both IT and Communications do, this is why the relationship between the two is so important.\n\nSharePoint and ServiceNow: familiar, but not always a fit\n\nIn many organizations, IT controls enterprise licenses for platforms like Microsoft SharePoint and ServiceNow. As a result, there\u2019s often pressure to maximize these investments\u2014even if that means stretching their original use cases and purpose. Over the last decade, I\u2019ve consulted with some of the world\u2019s largest companies on how they manage their employee communications infrastructure. One common theme is the use of SharePoint and ServiceNow as makeshift intranets or communication platforms.\n\nSharePoint was built for document management and team collaboration\u2014not communications. But many organizations have expanded its scope to become their default intranet. Without strong governance, this often results in a proliferation of disjointed SharePoint sites. Content becomes duplicated and outdated. Employees searching for HR policies or benefit documents encounter multiple, conflicting versions. The user experience becomes confusing and inefficient.\n\nSimilarly, while ServiceNow excels at workflow automation and IT service management, its interface and capabilities aren\u2019t optimized for communication or content engagement. Yet, due to its cost and enterprise footprint, some companies try to retrofit it for these purposes\u2014with mixed results.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that SharePoint or ServiceNow can\u2019t work for some organizations in their communications. But for those where employee communications and experience are high priorities, it\u2019s worth taking a closer look at purpose-built intranet platforms that were designed with communications in mind.\n\nThe day after: who owns the experience?\n\u2022 What happens the day after we launch?\n\u2022 Who\u2019s going to be responsible for the content and keeping the homepage up to date and fresh?\n\u2022 Who will track employee engagement and usability?\n\u2022 Who will ensure that the intranet evolves with the needs of employees?\n\nThe answer? Communications of course.\n\nOnce the intranet becomes a daily ritual for employees, Communications professionals will be the ones responsible for publishing content, organizing information, and driving adoption. It is for this reason that they must have a meaningful role in choosing the platform they\u2019ll be expected to lead.\n\nTo be clear, this doesn\u2019t mean IT\u2019s role ends at this point. Ongoing collaboration will be essential to ensuring the intranet remains secure, stable, and scalable. But once it is in place, Communications will be on the frontline. They\u2019re the ones who will be expected to bring it to life, every single day.\n\nThat\u2019s why intranet buying decisions cannot be made in isolation. The Corporate intranet isn\u2019t just software\u2014it\u2019s an employee communications, engagement and experience strategy. If IT builds it, Comms will be expected to fill it. But both will have the ongoing responsibility for shaping it.\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best document management software of 2025\nManage your archives better with the best DMS system\nWe list the best document management software, to make it simple and easy to use a DMS to digitally manage your files.\nThis is becoming increasingly important as the concept of a paperless office is actually turning into an everyday reality, especially with the growth in remote working. This means that routine office documents cannot be simply filed in an office, and instead need to be archived online. This is where cloud storage really comes into its own, as many service providers can also accommodate document sharing and syncing for organizations.\nHowever, a Document Management Software (DMS) platform isn't simply about archiving information securely online, as much as making the whole process of document management easier, covering everything from branded templates, improving workflows, working with collaboration tools, as well as being able to sort through sometimes technical information. And that's on top of general document editing and management tasks.\nGood document management software also has to be able to work with different digital file types, not just from office software, images and designs, and anything else you could imagine previously being printed on paper, including from legacy file formats. These days it will also cater for online document e-signing software .\nHowever, a lot of suppliers and contractors will still deal with paper, so any DMS needs to have a document scanning solution, often working as a standalone or part of an OCR scanning software package, so that any such paper invoices, receipts, or other documents can be scanned so that a digital copy can be archived while the paper version is recycled.\nThe paperless office has been a long-time in coming, but it's finally here for those who want to embrace it. Below we list the best document management software solutions currently available.\nWe've also featured the best alternatives to Microsoft Office.\nThe best document management software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest document management software for business\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDocHub offers a complete document management software solution, letting users handle a wide range of tasks through the online service.\nWe were quite impressed when we reviewed the service, finding it a feature-rich solution for businesses. Of course, this includes essentials like collaboration tools, electronic signatures and filling in forms. But there\u2019s also unlimited cloud storage for documents (a rarity), integration with Google and Dropbox, and the ability to edit and modify digital documents. In other words, this is the complete package.\nWith a user-friendly interface, getting around DocHub is very simple, very intuitive. If you\u2019re looking for free document management software, DocHub does include this option. However, it\u2019s limited to five eSignatures and three sign requests a month, with other limitations attached. Great for trying the service to see if it\u2019s right for you, but to get the most from it, you\u2019ll likely want to opt for the monthly/annual subscription, DocHub Pro, which starts at $10 a month on an annual plan. This includes unlimited eSignatures, sign requests, and more.\nRead our full DocHub review\nBest document management software for complex workflows\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPandaDoc offers a lot more than just the option to fill in forms and sign docs. The software allows you to create complex documents from scratch and track their progress from the very beginning to the signing of contracts.\nYou can choose the pre-made templates or go with a blank slate. Either way, you have a very powerful layout designer in your hands. It\u2019s really flexible as you can easily add videos, images, and similar as well as make a simple text document.\nPandaDoc has several pricing plans with the cheapest one called Essentials. This gets you unlimited document uploads and e-signatures, real-time tracking and notifications, rich media drag-and-drop document editor, document analytics, and a few more things.\nNext in line is the Business plan which adds some more goodies, including CRM and Zapier integrations, custom branding, a content library, and more. There\u2019s also an Enterprise option for large companies with complex document workflows, and for that, you need to contact the sales department directly.\nTo create an account you\u2019ll need your email, name, phone, and some details regarding your business or company. The software doesn\u2019t ask you to create your own signature when creating the account, instead, you\u2019ll have to find that on your own by going to the profile settings. From there you can then pick the font and color of your signature.\nApart from being available on desktop, PandaDoc also has apps for Android and iOS.\nRead our full PandaDoc review.\nBest document management software for automated workflows\nReasons to buy\nWhen it comes to document management, M-Files aims to improve internal workflows, and to ensure important information is kept secure at all times. Its customers include many large corporations such as Comcast and Yokohama.\nThere\u2019s a single vault for a plethora of files, and you can easily find them by client, project, date, status or other criteria. The software aims to avoid duplication \u2013 it\u2019s quite common to end up with two copies of the same report, or possibly more.\nM-Files will alert you if a document has been saved twice by analyzing names and project data. You get some great integrations too, including Microsoft Office and Salesforce CRM.\nThere is a free trial available, but pricing isn\u2019t stipulated on the site, so you have to get in touch for a quote.\nRead our full M-Files review\nBest document management software for digital workspaces\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDocuWare takes a cloud-based approach to document management. It integrates cloud storage and office automation to create a digital workplace. This paperless approach to the full spectrum of office tasks is another example of the digital transformation which is driving many processes these days.\nDocuWare offers services to create a \u2018cloud workflow\u2019 when it comes to documents. It allows services to be purchased on a small scale as needed, and then as use-case scenarios are created, and reliability is ensured, the service can be scaled up for a larger deployment.\nMobile apps that can integrate into this workflow are also offered, facilitating the likes of scanning receipts on the go, approving invoices for speedy payment, and signing forms directly on the device.\nWhile DocuWare does offer a demo and free trial, the pricing of course, depends on the services chosen, therefore requiring the prospective buyer to get in touch for a custom quote.\nRead our full DocuWare review\nBest all-in-one document management software\n5. Templafy\nReasons to buy\nTemplafy is one of the best document management tools out there. The system aims to integrate essential office suites and solutions used by businesses on a daily basis.\nIf there\u2019s one thing that can be frustrating, it\u2019s having to create brand documents using different software. This can become time-consuming and fragmented, but Templafy can help. With it, you can create a range of files within the system and manage them from a single feed.\nThe software is compatible with a range of devices and uses the cloud to let you access all your documents across computers, tablets and smartphones. There are also automatic compliance checks, and you can give feedback to employees easily, too.\nContact is required for a pricing quote, and not surprisingly, the exact cost depends on the number of users, features and add-ons chosen.\nBest document management software for compliance\n6. MasterControl\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWithin big organizations, there are often processes and regulations put in place to ensure documents are compliant and follow company guidelines. But when you have a ton of files, it can be hard to follow such rules.\nMasterControl Document Control Software, which is used by some of the world\u2019s largest regulatory bodies, is document management software that addresses complex regulations and standards around the globe. It aims to reduce compliance cost and increase internal efficiency.\nThe system fully automates routing, delivery, escalation and approval of vital documents. It also sports a centralized, secure archive where you can store and search for business files.\nThere is no indication of a free trial, and pricing requires contacting the company for a quote.\nBest document management software for collaboration\n7. XaitPorter\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you\u2019re looking for a cloud solution for creating documents, then you should definitely check out XaitPorter.\nThe great thing about this system is that it\u2019s extremely flexible. You\u2019re able to collaborate and work on documents with colleagues simultaneously, and you can easily share feedback with each other. It also manages all aspects of workflow, so you don\u2019t have to worry about formatting, numbering and layout.\nXaitPorter has some useful tricks on the integrations front, as well. The software can work with Salesforce, Oracle, SAS, Microsoft 365, OpenText and Dropbox. And it\u2019s currently used by over 45,000 firms across the globe.\nWhile there is a demo available, there is no free trial, and pricing requires getting in touch for a quote.\nAlso consider these document management solutions:\nWhile there are a number of dedicated office and document platforms we could mention, not least Office 365, LibreOffice, and Adobe Document Cloud, these are more focused on creating documents and managing those, rather than managing and storing documents from multiple sources and formats. Therefore we'll continue this list by featuring some of the other DMS solutions worth considering:\nSamepage is a little different to standard document management as it's more about creating a single focal point for all communications, projects, and document sharing tools. The aim is to simplify everything in a single app as opposed to having multiple software applications for different tasks. The interface is simple and easy to use, with collaboration built into the heart of it. In that regard it makes Samepage a potentially flexible solution to cover multiple needs.\nDokmee advertises itself as an enterprise content management solution, to organize, secure, and manage files. It supports a number of document formats, and also provides document imaging and data capture as part of its service. Everything can be smartly indexed using AI, with files automatically stamped for indexing, as well as rules-based routing to make storage and archiving easier, which is all done through secure hosting in the cloud. As expected, collaboration is supported, with permissions and auditing options available for easier file management.\neFileCabinet is a document management software solution that uses smart automation to organize, name, and store files according to their content. Templates are available to customize the document folder tree throughout your system. Permissions, file/folder expiration, and notifications can also be set up for file sharing and for sending file requests, all of which is done using a secure URL. General accessibility rules can also be set up according to company policy.\nAbbyy are perhaps most famous for their file reader and scanning services, but they also provide a digital document archiving service which allows for the secure storage and use of documents. Access can be tracked and logged, and existing documents can be reused and edited as required for reissue. Meta keywords can be applied for easy search on top of normal search functions, and distributed easily via the web or email as required. One potential limitation is that Abbyy services are primarily built to store documents in PDF format.\nBest document management software: FAQs\nWhich document management software is best for you?\nWhen deciding which document management software to download and use, first consider what your actual needs are, as budget-priced software options can sometimes prove limited when it comes to the variety of tools available, while higher-end software can really cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require.\nHow we tested the best document management software\nOur team of experts have tested a wide range of essential office software, including the best PDF editors and the best eSignature software. Whether we're looking at CRMs or DMS, we take the same rigorous review process to test out these tools.\nTo test for the best document management software we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each software platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

We feature the best payroll software, tax software, and other useful tools that check and analyze employee performance.\nAlternatively, you could use HR outsourcing services or even a full Professional Employee Organization (PEO) service, where all HR tasks are taken over by a third party.

The on-demand pay option is a unique feature, allowing employees flexibility in payment frequency. Positioned between a payroll application and HRIS, Paycor offers a solid solution for smaller businesses.

This covers payroll management, expenses, and even talent development. As with other premium providers, the main employee portal allows you to manage your organization, post news, updates, and manage the onboarding process. Moreover, you can even run payroll from the same portal, though we didn\u2019t find it as user-friendly as some other premium solutions in this list.\nOne of the stand-out features offered by Paycor, which is usually not part of HR solutions is the on-demand pay feature. With this, the employees can decide when they get paid (weekly, monthly, etc.). Conversely, Paycor tries to walk a thin line between a payroll application and a human resource information system. While it is not the best in class in either of these areas, it does offer a solid blend for small to mid-sized businesses.\nIf you\u2019re a company below 50 employees the pricing plans are divided into Complete, Core, Essential, and Basic plans. If you\u2019re a larger company, you will need to contact the firm directly to get a quote. It is not the cheapest option on the market, but from time to time they offer a 50% discount for the first 6 months, which makes it an attractive option.\nRead our full Paycor review.\nBest HR software for versatility\nReasons to buy\nLots of businesses are moving to flexible, remote ways of working, and plenty of companies are growing quicker than ever. Rippling is the ideal HR provider if you need a company that can cope with the versatility of modern business.\nRippling offers remote laptop management and instant local tax registration, so you can manage staff no matter where they're located. It also provides a slick, straightforward dashboard that you can use to evaluate data, manage employees, pay salaries and alter employee benefits.\nThis company offers the sort of benefits you'd expect from the most prestigious organizations, and you can rely on one-on-one support from experts on a complete range of issues.\nRippling is eminently scalable, too: it's easy to upgrade or downgrade your services to match your business needs, and it's simple to stop using Rippling if you want to bring HR in-house. Services are billed using a flat per-employee rate, too.\nIf you've got a company dominated by remote or flexible working or if your business is growing rapidly, then Rippling could be the HR provider you need thanks to its balance of versatility and features.\nRead our full Rippling employee management review.\nBest HR software for large businesses\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe BrightHR platform is packed full of advanced HR management features. It offers an excellent selection of staff management tools, including a neat holiday planner. On top of this, you can record absences and sick leave in just a few seconds. Documentation, including medical certificates, can be scanned directly into the system, and you will receive notifications when team members are due to return to work.\nThe BrightHR system also tracks various metrics to help you with payroll calculations, reducing the time you need to spend on admin processes. This includes overtime tracking, a complete record of paid and unpaid absences, and information about bonuses or other extra payments that you owe employees.\nAnother noteworthy feature is BrightHR\u2019s unlimited cloud storage.

Lanteria\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLanteria offers a broad platform of HR solutions for medium and large enterprises. Companies like Warner Bros and Lufthansa use it, and it's based on Microsoft SharePoint and Office 365, so it's easy to integrate with many of the packages that are popular in loads of big companies.\nThe central dashboard has modules that tackle a variety of common HR tasks. You can manage and monitor employee attendance, payroll, recruitment, performance, and training from different areas of the straightforward software, and the dashboard's home screen provides clear statistics on your business, from absences and helpdesk tickets to goals and documents that need your attention.\nLanteria's software is cloud-based, so it works from any internet-connected device, and it can also automate tasks and workflows, handle custom signatures, and manage employee reviews.\nThere aren't many HR products that offer as many features as Lanteria, but it will be overkill for many businesses.

      "text": "UCaaS: the driver of the digital workforce\nWhy UCaaS is critical for modern businesses\nThe way we work has changed. But despite flexible working now being offered by the majority of UK employers, many businesses are burdened by fragmented tools. Employees are forced to juggle multiple apps and platforms to manage calls, messages, and meetings. This inefficiency stalls productivity and results in poor user experience, leaving 75% of businesses actively seeking to reduce the number of applications they use.\nIn today's fast-paced, hybrid work environment, businesses need collaboration tools that are secure, scalable, and able to work across any device and location. Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) is about making this a reality. Consolidating voice, video, messaging, and collaboration tools into a single, cloud-driven platform, it streamlines operations and creates a more efficient workflow. It has become a driver of the digital workforce, and the market is set to reach over 131 million global users by 2028, according to Cavell.\nManaging Director of BT Wholesale.\nMobility at the heart\nMobility is rapidly shaping the future of communications Today, 57% of workers say smartphones are essential to their jobs and 71% of Microsoft Teams users rely on mobile apps \u2013 with over 17 million users depending on the platform\u2019s \u2018phone\u2019 feature every month.\nIn short, mobile integration is no longer a \u2018nice to have\u2019. For organizations looking to remain competitive and connected, UCaaS solutions that prioritize mobility are key. These platforms enable users to switch effortlessly between devices, whether they are at a desktop in the office or working remotely.\nThis is especially vital for industries with mobile workforces - such as healthcare, logistics, or retail - where seamless switching between mobile and desktop isn\u2019t just convenient, it\u2019s critical. Whether it\u2019s a nurse updating electronic health records on the go or a delivery driver needing quick access to customer details, teams need to stay connected and productive, wherever their work takes them.\nUCaaS success isn\u2019t just about the software- it\u2019s about the network. A strong, secure, and resilient connectivity foundation is essential. Whether it\u2019s for high-quality voice calls or real-time messaging, everything depends on reliable infrastructure. Businesses need to partner with UCaaS providers who can deliver the robust network support required to enable a mobile, cloud-first workforce.\nKeeping it simple\nIn the age of flexible working, it\u2019s more important than ever that people have access to a simple and accessible communications platform. One which doesn\u2019t require arduous dial-in processes and tenuous connections between multiple parties, or which only supports voice calling \u2013 so when you want to send an instant message, you\u2019re back to square one.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nUCaaS allows businesses to break down silos between teams and locations. Whether working on a presentation or responding to a customer query, it ensures all communications are accessible from one centralized platform. Being cloud-based means cloud documents are accessible across locations too. Employees with the right expertise can be involved at the right time, overcoming the challenges of disjointed communication channels.\nWhile adopting a new IT or communications system can feel daunting for business leaders, UCaaS is much simpler. Many shy away from new systems because of the perceived complexity involved, but it is often designed with the user in mind, avoiding the friction that comes with traditional communication platforms.\nFor IT teams, ease of deployment and maintenance is just as important. With digital communication solutions, updates are often handled centrally in the cloud, reducing the need for costly on-site support or downtime. Employees don\u2019t need hours of training to get up to speed either - most platforms mirror the simplicity of consumer apps, allowing teams to focus on their work, not the tools. This simplicity also shortens the time to value for organizations, helping them realize ROI faster and with fewer barriers. At a time when digital transformation fatigue is real, this simplicity can make all the difference.\nWork smarter, not harder\nBeyond video calls and file sharing, there are advanced features that bring big business benefits. Fraud prevention tools significantly improve security and customer interactions. AI-driven call analytics provide insights that allow businesses to improve decision-making, and capabilities like streamlined call management unlock seamless customer experience for businesses, too.\nFor example, call queues and interactive voice response services direct inbound calls efficiently, in turn reducing wait times and ensuring no customer inquiry goes unanswered. This efficiency can have a direct impact on a company\u2019s bottom line. Customers who experience quick, responsive service are more likely to return \u2013 and to spend more. It\u2019s a win-win.\nAmidst rising economic pressures and the analogue switch-off, businesses need to increase their margins. UCaaS enables this by streamlining operations, cutting complexity, eliminating the need for redundant lines and multiple devices, and importantly, reducing costs.\nAs organizations race through periods of transition, seamless, integrated communication enables them to thrive. Ultimately, time is a business leader\u2019s most valuable asset. The ability to adapt quickly, innovate continuously, and communicate seamlessly offers a competitive advantage \u2013 one that UCaaS provides.\nWe list the best business phone systems.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best Authenticator App for 2025: Features and Security Reviewed and Compared\nAdd an extra layer of online security with the best authenticator app\nAuthenticator apps are security tools that enhance the security of your online accounts. They work by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA), which adds an extra layer of verification beyond just a username and password. Since passwords alone can be easily stolen, guessed, or leaked in data breaches, authenticator apps help ensure that even if someone has your login credentials, they still can\u2019t access your account without a second form of authentication.\nAuthenticator apps typically work by generating time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs), which are unique codes that refresh every 30 seconds. When you log in to an account protected by 2FA, you'll be prompted to enter the current code displayed in your authenticator app. Because the code changes constantly and is tied to your device, it\u2019s virtually impossible for a hacker to guess. In some cases, authenticator apps can also send push notifications that you simply approve to confirm your identity.\nMany authenticator apps go a step further by offering biometric verification, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to open the app or to approve a login request. This adds another layer of protection, ensuring that even if someone has access to your device, they still can\u2019t bypass authentication without your physical presence. Overall, authenticator apps provide a simple yet powerful way to safeguard your digital identity and reduce the risk of account takeovers.\nOur security experts have been testing and evaluating authenticator apps for years, looking at how each one verifies your identity, its compatibility across devices and platforms, adherence to security and compliance standards, overall usability, and the range of additional security features it offers.\nWe've also listed the best security keys and the best password managers.\nReader Offer: Save 61% on NordPass for Business\nNordPass provides an easy-to-use and highly secure solution that most businesses will love, according to Techradar editors. Plans start at less than $1.79 per user per month - plus get 3 months extra.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nThe best authenticator apps of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest authenticator app overall\n1. Authenticator App by 2Stable\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Authenticator App by 2Stable delivers a robust suite of features for users who value both privacy and convenience.\nOne area where the app excels is in secure cloud sync, which works through iCloud. This helps sync your 2FA codes across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, and even your Apple Watch. For users embedded in the Apple ecosystem, this significantly enhances the user experience. It also includes biometric authentication features adding yet another layer of protection.\nWe also like the app\u2019s backup and restore functionality that stores 2FA tokens in an encrypted format, which helps reduce the risk of being locked out if you change or lose your device.\nOther thoughtful touches include Apple Watch support, widgets for quick access, multiple import options, the ability to use the app without creating an account, and a lot more.\nThe app\u2019s biggest limitation is that it isn\u2019t available on Android devices, though the developers claim this is in the works. The $50 annual price tag could be another hindrance for many, though the app offers a feature-restricted free version that can manage two accounts.\nAll things considered, 2Stable\u2019s Authenticator app is best suited for users who view security and convenience as equally important, and don\u2019t mind paying a premium for both.\nBest authenticator app for security\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDeveloped by the makers of NordVPN, NordPass Authenticator benefits from the company\u2019s established reputation in digital security. That said, NordPass Authenticator isn\u2019t a general-purpose authenticator app. Instead the app is built for companies that already rely on NordPass Business for their password management needs.\nUsing NordPass Authenticator saves NordPass Business users the effort to copy codes from a separate app, as it allows all your employees to generate and use TOTP codes directly within the NordPass Business vault. This simplifies the login process for enterprise users and reduces friction in daily workflows.\nAlso, because it\u2019s part of the NordPass Business infrastructure, admins can enforce policies around 2FA usage, monitor access logs, and maintain visibility into how 2FA is being used within your organization. That level of control simply doesn\u2019t exist in standalone authenticator apps.\nOn the downside though, NordPass Authenticator lacks the robust backup and recovery features found in other authenticator apps. There\u2019s no option for cloud backups, like you get with 2Stable\u2019s authenticator app, nor the ability to restore your tokens on a new device. In the same vein, it also lacks any ability to sync tokens across multiple devices.\nNordPass Authenticator is bundled along with the NordPass Business product, plans for which start from $1.99/user/month when paid for a year, or $1.79/user/month when subscribed for two years.\nBest cross-platform authenticator app\n3. Authy\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAuthy is a popular 2FA app that\u2019s developed by Twilio. The app stands out for its ease of use and advanced features despite being available for free, and has a clean, responsive, and easy to navigate user interface.\nNot only does Authy support both Android and iOS, it also doesn\u2019t restrict you to a single device. Thanks to its multi-device sync you can access your 2FA tokens across your smartphones, and tablets.\nAlso, unlike many other apps in the genre, Authy offers more than just basic 2FA functionality. One of its most popular features is the encrypted cloud backup system. This helps you access your 2FA token even if you lose or replace your phone. You can also lock Authy behind a PIN, fingerprint, or facial recognition, which adds an extra layer of protection.\nYet, despite its strong feature set, Authy isn't without drawbacks. For starters, your Authy account is tied to your phone number. This makes you vulnerable to SIM swap attacks and also means you\u2019re sharing personal information with Twilio.\nAlso, once you\u2019ve set up 2FA tokens in Authy, moving them to another app isn't straightforward as there\u2019s no mechanism to export your data. So, if you ever want to switch to another authenticator, you\u2019ll have to laboriously first disable 2FA on each of your online accounts and then re-enable it using the new authenticator app.\nBest authenticator app for ease of use\n4. Google Authenticator\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMany folks have a love/hate relationship with Google and if you're in the latter category, you probably want to move on to the next option on this list. For everyone else, say hello to the easiest and most basic authenticator app on the planet.\nGoogle Authenticator has been around for over a decade, is free, and will work with virtually every service that supports TOTPs. The app is as streamlined as it gets. There are no bloated menus, and you don\u2019t need to set up an account to use the app.\nFor a long time that was the extent of Google Authenticator\u2019s capabilities. But the app has received significant updates in 2025. The biggest news for Google Authenticator users is the introduction of cloud syncing. You can now backup your codes to your Google account and sync it across all your devices, whether they're Android phones, iPhones, or iPads, as long as they are logged into the same Google account. The app now also has a Privacy Screen feature, which helps protect access with your device's screen lock, PIN, or fingerprint, and facial recognition.\nDespite the improvements, there are a few areas where it lags behind some of its peers. For instance, while there is a search facility to find specific accounts, you don\u2019t get any organization features that you get with some other apps like Authy. Also, Google Authenticator remains a mobile-only app, and while it does work on iOS devices as well, unlike Duo Mobile, it can only backup and sync to a Google account.\nBest authenticator app for enterprise\n5. Duo Mobile\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDeveloped by Cisco, Duo Mobile is best known for its use in corporate environments. Duo Mobile does more than just generate time-based TOTPs. It's built to work as part of a broader identity and access management system, but many of its core features make it a solid 2FA app even for personal use, especially since it\u2019s available for free.\nDuo Mobile works on Apple and Android phones, and tablets, as well as on smart watches. The app has a straightforward interface that makes it easy to manage multiple accounts.\nOne of the standout features of Duo Mobile is push-based approval. Instead of typing in a 6-digit code, supported services can send you a push notification on your phone when trying to log in. Simply tap \"Approve\" and you're in. It\u2019s fast, intuitive, and eliminates the need to manually input codes.\nThat said, the app also supports standard TOTP codes, so you can still use Duo Mobile to generate codes just like you would with other authenticator apps. The app also supports account recovery through secure cloud backups, via iCloud on iOS and Google Drive on Android.\nBut while you can back up and restore accounts, you can\u2019t actively sync the codes between devices like you can with Authy or 2Stable\u2019s Authenticator app. Similarly, Duo Mobile is a mobile-only app. So if you're looking to access your 2FA tokens from a computer or browser, you'll need to look elsewhere.\nBest authenticator app for LastPass users\n6. LastPass Authenticator\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLastPass Authenticator is a good enough 2FA app, but it works best as an add-on for LastPass password manager users, rather than as a top-tier general-purpose authenticator on its own.\nThe app has a clean, user-friendly interface, and the process to add, remove, and view tokens is pretty straightforward. Like most 2FA apps, LastPass Authenticator works with virtually any online service that supports TOTPs. The app also scores for supporting fingerprint, and PIN protections, which helps keep your tokens secure if someone gets access to your unlocked phone.\nThat said, while it works as a general 2FA app, many of its interesting features are tied to your LastPass account.\nFor instance, unlike some of its peers, like Authy, which allows real-time sync across multiple devices, LastPass Authenticator only backs up and restores tokens through your LastPass account.\nIt also supports push notification for login approval, but again only when paired with the LastPass password manager. While it works on both Android and iOS, the app is strictly mobile-only, and doesn\u2019t have a desktop or browser extension.\nAll things considered, while LastPass Authenticator is functional as a standalone 2FA app, it doesn\u2019t offer much for non-LastPass users.\nBest authenticator app for Microsoft users\n7. Microsoft Authenticator\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMicrosoft Authenticator is a good authenticator app, but it's primarily designed with Microsoft account users in mind. The app is available for both Android and iOS, works with any service that supports 2FA, and is fairly intuitive to use. It also offers a search function to sort through your 2FA accounts, which is helpful if you\u2019ve enabled it for several services.\nThe app also by default locks itself behind the device\u2019s biometric and PIN to add an extra layer of protection if someone gets access to your phone.\nAnd that\u2019s the extent of its non-Microsoft account linked features. The app offers an encrypted cloud backup of your 2FA tokens, but this is linked to your Microsoft Account, or iCloud for iOS users.\nAlso, if you use Microsoft services, you\u2019ll benefit from push-based logins that you can approve with a tap. Like many of its peers, Microsoft Authenticator too is a mobile-only app.\nFor a long time, Microsoft Authenticator has offered password autofill and even some basic password management functions. However, as of August 2025, these features are being deprecated to make the app a streamlined authenticator app, which further limits its appeal to non-Microsoft account users.\nBest authenticator app for Apple users\n8. Step Two\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nStep Two is a good authenticator app that\u2019s designed specifically for the Apple ecosystem. While it\u2019s not the most feature-rich authenticator out there, it offers a clean, distraction-free interface that works well across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. If you regularly use multiple Apple devices, Step Two ensures your codes are available on all of them without any manual setup.\nTokens are automatically and securely synced via iCloud. This means your 2FA tokens are always backed up and restored across devices tied to your Apple ID cutting out the risk of losing access to them if you upgrade your phone.\nYou can use the app for free to manage up to 10 accounts/services. For a one-time purchase of $10, you can use Step Two to handle any number of accounts.\nThe biggest drawback of the app is that it is made exclusively for Apple platforms. This means that if you ever switch to Android, there's no way for you to transfer your tokens from Step Two.\nThe app also falls short of 2Stable\u2019s authenticator app in terms of features. For starters, it only supports the Safari browser, unlike 2Stable\u2019s that supports all the best web browsers.\nAuthenticator app FAQs\nHow to choose the best authenticator apps\nWhen deciding which authenticator app to use, first consider what your actual needs are, as sometimes free and budget software may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a paid platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, higher-end software can really cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your authenticator app.\nHow do authenticator apps work?\nWithout fail, one of the easiest ways to begin using 2FA is by using your smartphone's camera and scanning a QR code provided by the company or website. Once you do, the authentication app gets to work by issuing an ever-changing unique code. That code is valid as the second form of identification for just a few seconds before the authentication app refreshes it.\nYou only have to scan the QR code once on a device. If you're using sync and backup (like many of the apps below), you probably won't have to scan a QR code during setup on another device. Otherwise, you will.\nThe codes are generated using a standard HMAC-Based One-Time Password (HOTP) algorithm developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). However, at no time does the IETF gain access to the codes.\nIs 2FA all the protection we need?\nWhen 2FA options first arrived, many thought online vulnerability would finally end in the tech world. But, unfortunately, that isn't the case. 2FA, like every other form of online security, isn't 100% secure. Try as they might, a hacker or two will figure out a way to gain access to something they shouldn't. In January 2022, for example, Crypto.com was attacked. Nearly 500 accounts were compromised, and the thieves made off with more than $31 million in cryptocurrencies.\nDespite its imperfections, 2FA still provides better protection than passwords alone.\nHow we tested the best authenticator apps\nTo test for the best authenticator apps we first set up an account with the relevant platform. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each authenticator app to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Creating a high performance organization: empower your citizen developers\nEmpowering non-IT employees as \u201ccitizen developers\u201d\nTraditionally, IT and digital teams have been kept centralized and separated from the rest of the business, acting as gatekeepers for new solutions, products and initiatives. While IT is undoubtedly a business-critical function, this centralized model can hamper innovation. With our research finding that nearly 20% of employees see a lack of innovation as a barrier to high performance across the organization, it\u2019s clear that this unnecessary bottleneck is preventing businesses from reaching their full digital potential.\nTo harness the power of enterprise technology, businesses should consider a new approach, one that empowers employees across departments to become technology changemakers. These \u201ccitizen developers\u201d \u2013 individuals who sit outside of IT \u2013 must be encouraged to identify and implement digital solutions tailored to specific challenges in their roles. This can help businesses foster a culture of innovation, agility, and continuous improvement, whilst easing pressures on stretched IT teams along the way.\nChief Information Officer at MHR.\nIT should not be innovation gatekeepers\nFor decades, businesses recruited heavily into IT functions as their digital infrastructure needs became vastly more complex, typically funneling all technology related change through a single department. Historically this offered the obvious benefits of centralizing control and compliance, but it may be less helpful to the way organizations have now evolved.\nEmployees across all departments are facing different challenges to those they faced a decade ago \u2013 the advent of hybrid working, the transition to AI tools, globally dispersed teams and clients \u2013 means they require tailored solutions to help them each work efficiently and effectively. If people need to wait for IT to determine each new product or initiative introduced across the business, great ideas and new ways of working can go ignored and ultimately missed. This in turn can dissuade individuals from suggesting new ways of working if they feel they aren\u2019t being valued or listened to by the digital experts.\nDemocratizing technology for all\nWe speak with many forward-thinking organizations that are increasingly recognising the need to democratize how and where new technologies are implemented across their teams. But the citizen developer model does of course come with challenges to mitigate. One risk in the model is that developers will focus on what is beneficial to their specific areas, and may not appreciate the up and downstream implications of making specific requests for change.\nTo square this circle, governance needs to remain front and center when implementing any new solution across the company. This can end up resulting in greater collaboration across teams, as citizen developers would work with the governance team to engender a greater understanding of the business, ultimately changing the culture of the company and ensuring that everyone is moving in the same direction.\nIt might seem a scary prospect to some, allowing staff without technical backgrounds to take charge of their own digital needs, but it can be done in a safe and effective way with the right guidelines in place. Low-code and no-code platforms are great examples of how technology can be put into the hands of employees outside of IT, allowing them to develop and deploy solutions quickly, without requiring advanced programming skills.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nBy empowering the workforce to become citizen developers and equipping them with accessible, user-friendly digital tools, they can take ownership of solving their own business challenges.\nRemoving barriers to innovation\nIt\u2019s one thing if employees are crying out for digital democratization, but this sometimes isn\u2019t the case. Some know the problems they face and the solutions they would like to see, but the gripe stops there. They continue with outdated and friction-heavy processes and don\u2019t think to bother IT or conceive their own digital workaround \u2013 perhaps due to the extra time it takes in an already busy working day. This is where change management comes in.\nWe typically find that a major challenge to enabling broader tech-driven innovation is overcoming resistance to change. Certain employees may hesitate to adopt new tools or step outside their traditional roles to engage with technology.\nOrganizations must actively work to evolve the mindset of the workforce, encouraging them to embrace digital literacy, continuous learning, and adaptability. Providing ongoing support, celebrating small wins, and highlighting success stories can help non-technical employees feel more confident in their ability to leverage technology effectively in their roles.\nAnother factor to consider is the potential risk of shadow IT, where employees use unauthorized software to meet their needs. While this highlights the demand for better tech accessibility, it also illustrates the importance of making user-friendly, company-approved tools available to everyone that needs it, to help encourage compliance without hampering innovation.\nThe future of digital innovation depends on collaboration\nThe future of work is not about replacing traditional IT roles \u2013 far from it \u2013 rather it\u2019s about enhancing them to be more collaborative with the wider organization. IT teams will always play a critical role in digital governance, security and large-scale digital transformation. But their role will increasingly shift towards empowering other departments to innovate in ways tailored to their respective functions, so that every individual can operate to their full potential without waiting on IT to come to their rescue.\nEnterprise technology is no longer confined to IT departments, nor should it be. But leaders must remember that embedding technology into the culture of a business requires having a shared vision in place that all tech implementations can ladder back up towards.\nWith this one clear objective across the business, employees are empowered to suggest solutions that align with the business\u2019s overarching objectives, meaning organizations can unleash one of their greatest assets \u2013 employee experience and knowledge \u2013 in so many ways previously unavailable to them.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best employee experience tool of 2025\nMake your workers happier\nWe list the best employee experience tools, to make it simple and easy to try and make your workers happier and therefore more productive.\nEmployees are the most important part of every business. Every company must invest in its employees to ensure they work effectively to please customers. Hence, there\u2019s an essential need for employee experience software tools that help businesses retain staff and improve productivity and business performance.\nEmployee experience tools help enterprises manage their employees effectively. For instance, the human resource (HR) department can use it to collect feedback about management and the company\u2019s overall direction. Employees can use the tool to discover in-depth information about their organization, e.g., the organizational flowchart, an employee directory, etc.\nWhen there\u2019s a need, you can be sure that there\u2019s someone fulfilling it. Many companies have built employee experience tools with different features to stand out from the competition. Some tools are tailored for specific industries while some are designed for broad usage. The list of employee experience tools is endless, so we tested different ones to identify the best.\nWe narrowed our list based on important factors including features, customer support, pricing, performance, etc. These tools have their respective advantages and disadvantages, but are, overall, the best ones you can use for your enterprise. They aren\u2019t perfect but they\u2019ll likely give you optimal results and help you boost employee productivity.\nWe've also listed the best employee scheduling software.\nThe best employee experience tool of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest employee experience tool for surveys\n1. Qualtrics\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nQualtrics is a very popular employee experience tool best known for its surveys. It began as a survey software company before morphing into a full-fledged experience platform but has stayed true to its roots. It is the best tool to choose if you want to conduct company-wide surveys and draw insights from them.\nQualtrics provides ready-made survey templates that you can choose and edit to fit your tastes. For example, you can find survey templates about employee training, engagement, onboarding, and regular work experience. With these templates designed by professionals, you don\u2019t need to waste time building your own from scratch.\nQualtrics is known for being user-friendly. It has an intuitive interface that even non-technical people will likely find easy to navigate. After implementing surveys, you can monitor their results via visual and interactive dashboards that make it easy to extract insights.\nBest employee experience tool for engagement\n2. Motivosity\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMotivosity is the product of a company based in Lehi, Utah, U.S.A. It is a popular employee experience platform that\u2019s best used for engaging with team members and recognizing employee achievements.\nMotivosity\u2019s Recognition & Rewards feature makes it easy to highlight employees doing a good job. You can highlight workers as the most valuable player (MVP), an employee of the month, the best customer support personnel, etc., and the recognition will be seen across your organization.\nIt doesn\u2019t just stop at recognition; you can set automatic rewards for recognized rewards, such as an Amazon gift card, iTunes gift card, Airbnb voucher, etc. Motivosity makes the process of recognizing outstanding employees very seamless.\nMotivosity has a mobile app, which makes it very convenient to use. It also has integrations with many third-party platforms for extra functionality. For instance, you can link it up with Slack for instant messaging, Microsoft Teams for video-conferencing, or Okta for identity management.\nBest employee experience tool for small business\n3. Trinet\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTrinet is an employee experience platform designed for small and medium-sized businesses. It enables enterprises to manage all aspects of employee engagement, including payroll, benefits, compliance, risk management, etc.\nYou can manage payroll across different jurisdictions easily via Trinet. The platform already has pre-built configurations for different types of payroll across different regions, including taxes for specific regions. You can also use Trinet to manage your employee benefits programs, such as 401k matches, insurance, marketplace discounts, etc.\nTrinet has an interactive mobile app that employees can access from anywhere and at any time. They can check details about their benefits, payroll, company events, etc., directly from their smartphone. Trinet has a document management solution designed for businesses. HR departments can use this feature to store important documents securely and retrieve them when needed. You can extract insights from employee data on this tool, although we observed many complaints of the analytics feature lagging behind the competition.\nTrinet does not have a standard plan. You\u2019ll need to contact the sales team for a quote, and the final price depends on certain factors such as the features you choose and the number of users.\nBest employee experience tool for rewards\n4. Bonusly\nReasons to buy\nBonusly is a platform designed for employee appreciation and recognition. As the name suggests, it allows enterprises to give bonuses to their employees seamlessly. You can award points to your employees and they can redeem them for real-life rewards.\nA good thing about Bonusly is that it lets employees choose what type of rewards to redeem their points on. They have a broad range of choices, including gift cards for Starbucks, Amazon, Target, Home Depot, etc, or pre-loaded Visa, Mastercard, and Visa cards. In all, Bonusly supports 1,200+ gift cards usable in over 190 countries. If an employee wishes, they can give their points to their colleagues.\nYou can use Bonusly to give automatic rewards to employees for hitting milestones. For instance, you can set an automatic reward for each employee whose tenure crosses 10 years or automatic rewards on employees\u2019 birthdays.\nBonusly offers a free trial, so you can test the features before making your final decision.\nBest employee experience tool for onboarding\n5. Enboarder\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nEnboarder is a well-known employee experience platform. We recommend this tool because of its effective onboarding and onboarding features. It makes it very easy to welcome new employees and help them get familiar with their new working environment, whether in-house or remote employees.\nYou can automate the onboarding process to make it easier for your HR staff. For instance, you can send an automatic welcome message to every new employee. You can also send automatic messages asking them about what work device they prefer, event notifications, and formal introductions to colleagues. You can collect feedback from new employees on the onboarding process to enable you to keep improving it.\nEnboarder also offers similar features for offboarding employees leaving your firm. You can send automatic goodbye messages to such employees and create surveys to gather feedback about their work experience. You can digitize the process of handing in work devices to finalize the offboarding process.\nEnboarder has integrations with third-party tools, e.g., Slack for messaging and Jira for task management. But we counted just two-dozen integrations in total, much less than what you'd find in competing products.\nWe've also listed the best customer exprience tools\nBest employee experience tool FAQs\nFeatures of an employee experience tool\n1. Surveys\nYou should be able to create surveys for your employees to fill out. These surveys help you gather feedback and evaluate employees\u2019 views of the company\u2019s overall strategy. The platform should present the survey results in a way that you can easily understand. Creating the surveys should also be relatively easy.\n2. Mobile app\nThese days, almost every working person has a smartphone. Thus, your employee experience tool should have a mobile app your employees can download and use. Mobile apps are convenient because people can access them from anywhere and at any time. They can fill out surveys, consult colleagues, monitor tasks, etc., from the convenience of a smartphone.\n3. Instant messaging/collaboration\nCollaboration is essential in every workplace. Hence, employee experience platforms usually have a built-in instant messaging tool to enable employees to communicate seamlessly with themselves. Alternatively, the platform may integrate with third-party instant messaging tools to support seamless communication.\n4. Employee recognition\nYour platform should have a section to recognize outstanding employees and make them stand out within your organization. You can also use this section to welcome new employees and make them feel at home. The idea is to recognize people for their positive contributions and encourage them to keep up their good work.\nHow to choose an employee experience tool\n1. Cost\nCost is the first thing to consider when choosing any software. It\u2019s necessary to choose something that you can afford in the long term. Most employee experience tools charge a fixed annual or monthly fee per user, so it\u2019s easy to estimate how much you\u2019ll pay in the long term. Always check if there\u2019s a free trial to test the platform\u2019s features before making your final decision.\n2. Ease of use\nYou need a tool that\u2019s easy to use, especially for non-technical employees. Your platform should have an intuitive interface that makes it easy to use and understand. Users should be able to switch different features with little confusion. Tools with complex interfaces can frustrate your employees and lead to costly mistakes.\n3. Customer support\nThings can go wrong with your platform at any time, and you\u2019ll likely need external help. You should choose an employee experience tool with a good reputation regarding customer support. You should be able to contact a human representative at any time. Similarly, you should have access to complimentary support resources such as video tutorials, user guides, manuals, etc.\nHow we tested the best employee experience tools\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what size of businesses this would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant apps, and check the overall scalability of the service. We also analyze whether there are collaboration features for multiple users, and lastly, we judge the quality of the customer service and the different pricing plans available.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "The future of enterprise comms is simple: use locally and act globally. Here's what's next\nEnding the telco patchwork for truly unified communications\nIn a world where enterprises now manage their unified communications (UC) platforms, such as Microsoft Teams, on a global basis, why are these same enterprises all too often still procuring and managing telecommunications services on a country-specific or regional basis?\nSurely there would be material efficiencies and cost savings to consistent global management of all communications \u2013 a truly \u2018unified\u2019 approach \u2013 rather than the inconsistent and disparate management of telecoms?\nThe answer lies in the legacy \u2013 and indeed current \u2013 business models and chosen strategies of the big telcos. And the solution lies in a new breed of multinational cloud telephony providers.\nCo-CEO and Co-Founder at LoopUp.\nTelecoms: a rapidly restructuring industry, post pandemic\nThe modern telecommunications industry has been restructuring at pace since the pandemic, as it reinvents itself to serve the demands of remote and hybrid staff and teams in the modern workplace. The big telcos may well have led the first restructuring dimension, but they have more reluctantly joined the bandwagon of the second, and their broader business model simply isn\u2019t suited to the third.\nFrom on premises to the cloud\nTo be fair, the big telcos were at the forefront of the industry\u2019s first restructuring dimension - the shift from on premises implementations to cloud-based business phone systems. In this shift telecoms essentially became just another form of data service delivered over fiber and 4G/5G broadband network that they themselves provided. This perfectly aligned with their broader strategies as network operators.\nCritically, moving services to the cloud enabled users to make and receive phone calls wherever they had internet access, be that at work, at home or on the move. Their phone numbers were able to travel with them rather than being tied to a physical desk or location. And, furthermore, enterprises were able to strip out the legacy switches and equipment from their offices and sites, thereby freeing up the time and cost of supporting, upgrading and replacing that equipment.\nThe rationale for users and companies alike was sufficiently strong that 71% of the telecoms market had shifted to the cloud by 2024.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nFrom standalone to UC-integrated\nThe second restructuring dimension suited the big telcos far less. But, in the end, it was unavoidable due to the customer demand. This shift involved the integration of telephony into broader UC platforms, such as Microsoft Teams.\nOut-of-the-box Teams is incredibly rich \u2013 messaging, channels, meetings, video calls and much more \u2013 but telephony is the missing piece that needs specific and additional integration.\nMore and more companies have understandably been doing this integration to achieve \u2018truly unified\u2019 communications, from both a user experience and IT management perspective. Furthermore, it also means that telephony content can be included in the enterprise\u2019s AI data set for fast-growing agent capabilities such as Copilot.\nThis shift to UC-integrated Teams telephony was by no means instantly popular with the big telcos, given a significant proportion of the value added was provided by Microsoft through its cloud phone system functionality.\nMicrosoft\u2019s ability to monetize that through license extensions effectively impaired profitability for the major telcos. In the end, however, customer demand won and now more than a hundred telcos have joined the bandwagon on Microsoft\u2019s Operator Connect and Direct Routing programs.\nFrom geography-specific to global\nBut now, a third restructuring dimension is rapidly taking hold in the multinational enterprise world. Until recently, multinationals have necessarily been working with multiple \u2013 often tens of \u2013 country-specific or regional telco vendors, each with their own contracts, tariff structures, administration portals (if indeed any at all), support services, and invoices.\nBut why would these multinationals want to maintain such a regional patchwork of telco vendors when they are now managing Teams on a singular, global basis? Not only do they want their telephony integrated with their UC platform, but they also want the management of the whole communications stack to be globally consistent. Why have tens of telco vendors when you can just have one?\nEnter a new breed of multinational cloud telephony providers\nHowever, global service provision simply isn\u2019t suited to the big telcos because now, primarily as broadband providers, their businesses remain physical in nature. What was once copper wires into buildings for telecoms, is now fiber into buildings for broadband, and the physical natural of those \u2018last mile\u2019 connections simply isn\u2019t conducive to a global strategy.\nIt is this defense against the big telcos, combined with the size of the market opportunity in Microsoft Teams telephony, and the compelling customer business case for multinational consolidation of vendors, that has led to a new breed of multinational cloud telephony providers.\nThese multinational cloud telephony providers capture all three industry restructuring dimensions: cloud-based, UC-integrated and multinational service provision. With one global vendor, multinational businesses can avoid the inefficiencies, wasted resources and fragmentation of working with multiple telcos in different regions, and move to a simplified world of one global contract, one global tariff and one global management portal.\nLINK!\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best online collaboration tool of 2025\nSoftware for teams\nWe list the best online collaboration software, to make it simple and easy for teams to work together.\nAlthough collaboration tools had already been set up for office teams, the pandemic and subsequent lock down that saw many people working remotely has lead to a resurgence in collaboration tool features. The result is that collaboration has become the new normal in the workplace.\nSince employees can no longer be expected to work from the same location, this means the ability for teams to share, use, and edit files at a distance has become essential for productivity.\nHowever, collaboration tools aren't simply limited to office software such as Microsoft docs and spreadsheets, but could be anything from using cloud document storage for managing daily tasks, to video conferencing for online meetings. Even better is that the best collaboration tools will work just as well on mobile devices as well as desktops and laptops.\nAbove all, everything should be clear, easy to understand, simply to use and reduce misunderstanding. Every employee should be empowered to be able to speak to the right person, wherever they are in the company, to address the same problem. And then solve that problem within an acceptable workflow.\nThe days of collaborative working are here, so below we list what we think are the best collaboration tools currently available.\nThe Future of Teamwork. Co-create in Real-Time with Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Start Your Google Workspace Free Trial. Save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nWe've also featured the best task management apps.\nThe best online collaboration tools of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest online collaboration tool for comms\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSlack is without doubt a mighty collaboration tool, with millions of users around the globe. It\u2019s an incredibly smart platform, and you can get it on mobile and desktop devices. It allows for the sending of direct messages (DMs) and files to a single person or a group of employees, and there\u2019s the ability to organize conversations into different channels (perhaps for specific projects, one for technical support, general chat, and so forth).\nThe app also supports video calling. You can use the feature to talk to your colleagues about projects and work in-depth, without having to type everything into a DM. While this isn\u2019t a replacement for cloud storage services, you are able to drag, drop and share files with your colleagues directly within Slack. It\u2019s also compatible with services such as Google Drive, Dropbox and Box.\nTo round things off, Slack even has a free version, although unsurprisingly it has limitations (in terms of the number of messages stored, overall storage space and so forth).\nRead our full Slack review.\nBest online collaboration tool overall\nReasons to buy\nMicrosoft Office may not be the first platform you think of when it comes to collaboration, but this now runs at the heart of the Microsoft 365 cloud-based office suite.\nThis is important because Microsoft Office remains the most used and therefore important office suite out there, and while there are competitors such as OpenOffice and Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) they still haven't caught up to the same level of functionality and ease of use.\nTherefore as Microsoft Office is likely to be at the heart of many businesses, the move to Microsoft 365 offers a number of advantages, not least the ability for teams to collaborate directly on the same set of documents. This could be anything from work shifts in an Excel spreadsheet, to a presentation in PowerPoint, to client reports written in Word.\nAdded to this is that Microsoft Teams now comes bundled with a number of Microsoft 365 packages, allowing for Unified Communications integrated with the traditional office software.\nWhat makes Microsoft 365 more attractive is that as a cloud-hosted platform it can be used not just with Windows, but also Mac, Android, and iOS.\nOverall, Microsoft 365 doesn't simply offer a great office suite, but one that is also firmly designed for collaboration and sharing with teams.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nOur Microsoft discount codes can help you save on your next purchase.\nBest all-in-one online collaboration tool\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMiro is one of those online tools that aims to bridge the gap between traditional office working and the modern hybrid routine that many of us are familiar with. It is best described as a multipurpose online collaboration tool, and its list of features is pretty extensive stretching beyond the typical realms of similar software.\nThe majority of the work you\u2019ll end up doing in Miro will revolve around what it calls boards, which start off as entirely blank spaces. Setting one up from scratch can be daunting and time-consuming, which is why the company has designed templates that you can pick from the get-go.\nSome of its most commonly accessed templates include mind maps, Kanban boards, flowcharts, product roadmaps, and timelines. Many of these will serve well as project management tools, and anybody familiar with other project management software like Airtable or Trello will already be familiar with how they work.\nOverall, we think Miro is hard to beat. Its long list of features should cover all parts of a typical business process from research and design to presentation, and its collaboration abilities are second to none. Furthermore, its transparency around security and reasonable pricing make it hard for us not to recommend it. The only thing we could wish for is better support channels.\nRead our full Miro review.\nBest online collaboration tool for tracking\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAsana has been around since 2008, making it a veteran in the collaboration arena, and companies such as Intel, Uber, Pinterest and TED all use it as their core method of communication.\nIt\u2019s been designed as an easy way for companies to track the work of employees and to get the best possible results. Using the platform, you can create to-do lists for ongoing projects, set reminders for upcoming deadlines and send requests to colleagues. Team members can also assign comments to posts within the app.\nYou can organize all your projects in a list or board format, and there\u2019s a search function so you can locate past work quickly. In short, Asana is a very effective way to stay super-organized and facilitate conversations when it comes to updates on how work is progressing.\nRead our full Asana review.\nBest online collaboration tool for organizing\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you have ever looked into project management software and online collaboration tools, then no doubt you\u2019ve come across Trello. Available on the web and with mobile apps, it lets you easily organize projects and work on them with colleagues.\nThe platform allows you to work with boards or lists, which can be organized by teams and different tasks. And within these, you can set up to-do lists and delegate amongst colleagues. There\u2019s also the option to assign comments to cards \u2013 a quick way to give feedback to others.\nFurthermore, Trello boasts a number of integrations with apps such as Evernote, GitHub, Google Drive and Slack. You can download the app for free, but there are premium options available which give access to more features.\nThe Premium pricing tier unlocks a number of additional administrative features for better organization. There's also an Enterprise edition which is priced according to the number of users required, and provides some additional organizational management features.\nRead our full Trello review.\nBest online collaboration tool space\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoogle Workspace (formerly called G Suite) is Google's answer to Microsoft 365, and more. This is one of the best platforms you can choose for an organization because it comes with a lot of features.\nThink of this software as the enterprise version of all the popular Google tools you use. For instance, you can create custom business emails for staff that uses the same interface as the popular Gmail app. People can create and edit documents collaboratively on Google Docs; you\u2019ll see any changes in real time, and anyone is free to make comments and suggestions for any changes.\nThere's Meet, a video-conferencing solution for enterprises; this tool for valuable for colleagues to stay in touch with each other, especially for remote companies. There\u2019s also Google Chat, a messaging tool for enterprises; Google Drive for file sharing; Google Sheets for spreadsheets; and a shared calendar tool that enables colleagues to keep tabs on each other\u2019s schedules. These tools are what you\u2019ll get access to as a Google Workspace subscriber.\nA Starter plan includes 30GB storage per user and a maximum of 100 participants in video meetings. The Standard plan includes 2TB of storage and up to 150 participants in video meetings. The Plus plan includes 5TB of storage per user and up to 500 participants in video meetings. There's also an Enterprise plan that offers as much storage and video meeting participants as you need; this plan has no standard pricing, so you'll have to contact the sales team for a quote.\nYou can save on your Google Workspace subscription with our Google Workspace promo codes.\nRead our full Google Workspace review.\nBest online collaboration tool for mobile\nReasons to buy\nPodio describes itself as a flexible and customizable online platform for work and communication among teams. In other words, it gives you a way to organize large stacks of work and to delegate tasks between employees.\nJust like many of the other business collaboration apps out there, Podio provides you with the tools to share files, view the status of ongoing projects and get feedback on the things you\u2019re currently working on. These functionalities are combined into an easy-to-use interface.\nPodio is also equipped with quality mobile apps for when you\u2019re out and about, and need to use your smartphone or tablet, and it has an impressive amount of integration with third-party services and apps including Dropbox, Google Drive, Evernote and Zendesk.\nRead our full Podio review.\nBest online collaboration tool for ease-of-use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRyver is similar to Slack, aiming to give your organization a highly effective means of communication, and an easy way to talk over tasks, ensuring that deadlines are met.\nWhat makes Ryver a compelling option is the fact that you can create as many teams as you want within the app, and easily categorize them to boot. As is the case with Slack, you can use the platform to set up chats with groups and individuals.\nThere are some interesting filters, too. You can control who sees the things you say and post in the app, and obviously enough, join the teams that are most relevant to you. All company posts are located within a Facebook-style newsfeed, and you can mark posts to come back to them later on.\nThere\u2019s also a host of native clients across mobile and desktop, including Mac and Linux. There's also a premium version for enterprise which offers workflow automation, Single Sign-On (SSO), and advanced team management.\nRead our full Ryver review.\nBest online collaboration platform\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAirtable is a platform that supports extensive online collaboration and project management. You can use it to share data seamlessly within an organization for people to collaborate. This platform has extensive third-party integration, so you can sync data from other apps and ensure it is always up-to-date.\nAirtable is not just a standalone collaborative tool. It is actually a platform on which people can build collaborative apps. It touts itself as \u201clow-code\u201d, meaning you don\u2019t need sophisticated programming skills to build apps on it, although a little will help. Anyone in your organization can build an app on Airtable to foster collaboration.\nYou can start with the free plan, which has limitations on the file sizes and the number of collaborators. Thus, you\u2019ll need a paid plan to maximize your use of this platform, and you can choose from one of three such plans; Plus, Pro, and Enterprise.\nThe Plus plan supports an unlimited number of users. The limitation is that you'll get a maximum of 5GB space per base (which refers to a project) and a maximum of 5,000 records for each base. The Pro plan increases the storage space to 20GB per base with a maximum of 50,000 records for each base. The Enterprise plan is the highest, giving you up to 1TB of space per base and 100,000 records; this plan has no standard pricing, so you\u2019ll have to contact the sales team for a quote.\nRead our full Airtable review.\nBest online collaboration tool for designers\n10. InVision\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nInVision is a collaborative tool built for designers. It provides a virtual whiteboard where multiple collaborators can share their design ideas and thoughts to come up with solutions. This whiteboard allows real-time interaction so that teams within an organization can brainstorm about work-related activities.\nThe whiteboard is called Freehand, owing its name to the fact people usually use their hands to write on whiteboards. In this case, the board is virtual, and you are free to write text while discussing with your team about a work project. You can also add images, photos, videos, etc., to provide context for your ideas.\nSometimes, you\u2019ll need templates to explain an idea to your teammates, e.g., flowcharts and interactive widgets. The good thing is that InVision provides over 200 pre-built templates that you can use for this.\nThe Freehand tool also has direct integrations with a lot of third-party software. For example, you can open a video chat by connecting to Zoom or Webex or turn your whiteboard ideas directly into tasks on Jira and Asana. If you wish, you can import your existing whiteboards from other collaborative apps, e.g., Miro.\nThis platform was built mainly for designers but is not exclusive to them. It is also suitable for product teams, human resource (HR) teams, marketing teams, etc.\nOther collaborative software to consider\nThere are many other collaboration tools worth your attention, if nothing else because of the way they apply features differently, or even add other useful features. Here we'll look at some additional online collaboration tools that could be worth exploring further:\nVisme is developed specifically for collaborative online reports, presentations, and infographics. Aside from promoting branding support and aiming to reduce design costs, analytics are provided so you can see which presentations and reports result in the most engagement, and adjust accordingly. Visme recommends itself for sales and marketing, HR and recruiting, internal communications, as well as education and in-house training. The software is specifically priced around individual, business, or education use.\nBasecamp aims to be an all-in-one collaboration and communications platform, to bring features of multiple software offerings into a single place so that it's easier to sort through information, and, of course, keep it all in one easy to manage place. Features include chat, messageboards, to-do lists and scheduling as well as automated check-in, as well as a single place to store all documents, files, and folders. Unlike other collaborative software that charges per user, Basecamp charges a single fee of $99.99 for unlimited users, which could make it especially attractive to larger organizations.\nWrike is more of a project management and scheduling tool, that makes it easy to see where everyone is in terms of completing a project. As a standalone it might seem quite limited compared to some of the others here, but its strength lies in its extensive range of integrations, which includes Google, Dropbox, Salesforce, Microsoft, Adobe, and Github. This means Wrike can work as a central platform tied to a number of others software apps, allowing you to cover a wider range of options and features than some standalone software options.\nMonday.com is a platform that allows you to plan, track, and collaborate on projects in a visually simple manner. Drag-and-drop functionality and ease of use make this a particularly good platform for project management and general workflow management among teams. It also integrates with Slack, Trello, Google Drive, Dropbox, and others, so you can use it a central focal point for teams to work together. As above, these integrations mean that monday.com can be used to achieve a wider working remit than the standalone platform itself.\nWe've also featured the best small business software.\nBest online collaboration tool FAQs\nTips for choosing a suitable online collaboration tool\n1. Consider your budget and look for something that\u2019s affordable for your enterprise. If you\u2019re a large organization with a sizeable IT budget, you can go with a more expensive platform that\u2019ll give you access to sophisticated features that you may not even need much. In contrast, if you\u2019re a small business, it\u2019s wise to choose a plan that gives you just the basic collaboration features at a reasonable price.\n2. Customer support. Things can go wrong at any time, so choose a platform that offers customer support via email, live chat, or telephone. Check user reviews to see what other people are saying about your intended platform\u2019s support before making a final choice.\n3. Look for a platform with a user-friendly interface. This will make it easy for employees of your organization to collaborate instead of losing productivity trying to figure out how to use the software.\n4. Choose a platform with a strong security reputation to avoid leaks or theft of sensitive data.\n5. Pick a platform that has integrations with third-party tools for additional functionalities that you may need.\nWhich online collaboration tools is best for you?\nWhen deciding which online collaboration tool to use, first consider what actual needs you have. For example, someone simply wanting to work with a handful of people on a casual basis may find a cheaper option is the most cost-effective while providing all of the necessary tools that would be required. However, if you're planning to use online collaboration tools for professional or business purposes, especially with a large number of people and on a regular basis, then you will probably want to look to the higher-end options for the more advanced options that are included.\nHow we tested the best online collaboration tools\nTo test for the best online collaboration tools we searched for a range of popular options as well as took recommendations from people we know who use online collaboration tools regularly. We then tried each platform to see how user-friendly each was, as well as determine what range of tools and advanced options were available. Pricing also came into account when determining our best list.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best UCaaS provider of 2025\nGet omnichannel comms with Unified Communications as a Service providers\nWe list the best UCaaS (Unified Communications as a Service) providers, to make it simple and easy to set up a unified communications system for the office and remote working.\nIn the past unified communications would mean making sure VoIP for internal and external calls could be combined into one system. However, these days it usually means adding other communication options such as chat/instant messaging, email, video conferencing, and even sometimes social media content.\nAdvances in digital technology means that it is now possible for providers to deliver UCaaS (Unified Communications-as-a-Service) in an accessible and affordable way for all sizes of business.\nWhile a number of companies are described as providing UCaaS, sometimes this has the practical experience of being more like many applications using a Single Sign On (SSO) to give the appearance of a unified platform. For this buying guide, we'll instead focus on those companies that deliver a true UCaaS experience by allowing all communications to be managed via a single application.\nHere we'll feature the best UCaaS providers currently available.\nWe've also listed the best CCaaS.\nThe best UCaaS providers of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest UCaaS provider UCaaS overall\nReasons to buy\nRingCentral MVP, formerly known as RingCentral Office, offers a complete unified communications solution that combines HD VoIP, messaging, conferencing, contact center, and fax, in a single application.\nWhat's especially good about RingCentral MVP is its total accessibility and scalability, allowing anywhere from a single user to over a 1,000 employees to sign up for the service, meaning that it can truly serve anything from the smallest business to enterprises.\nDifferent features are available according to different payment plans, but even the most basic Essentials plan offers a comprehensive range, including unlimited calls within the US and Canada, as well as unlimited SMS and MMS, and also mobile apps for use with iOS and Android for mobile use. Other features include visual voicemail, voicemail-to-email, as well as full call management and phone system administration which includes call recording on demand.\nAll plans also offer integrations with Microsoft, Google, and Box.\nRead our full RingCentral MVP review.\nBest UCaaS provider for small and medium-sized businesses\nReasons to buy\nNextiva offers an all-in-one UCaaS solution that bundles the various services they offer, voice, video, messaging, and fax together with other business applications.\nThe service has flexible pricing, with three available plans, Essential, Professional and Enterprise. All the plans have 24/7 customer support, and the actual price decreases the more users there are.\nSo, for over 100 users, the Essential plan gets you unlimited voice and video calls, toll-free numbers, voicemail, unlimited internet fax, and integration with Outlook/Google contacts.\nThe Professional plan enhances the Essential plan by including unlimited conference calls for up to 40 participants, screen sharing, an auto attendant, unlimited video conferencing, and SMS/MMS capabilities on both mobile and desktop platforms. Additionally, it features integrations with Salesforce or HubSpot.\nThe Enterprise plan encompasses all the features of the Professional plan and adds further goodies such as call recording, unlimited video conference recording, unlimited participants in voice and video conferencing, voicemail transcription, integrations with Microsoft Teams/Enterprise, and single sign-on functionality.\nAll in all, Nextiva is a reliable and user-friendly service that is suited for businesses of all sizes.\nRead our full Nextiva review.\nBest affordable UCaaS provider\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOoma Office is a business phone service with built in UCaaS that aims to deliver a big business phone experience to small businesses.\nOoma might not have all the features found with rival services, but it presents itself as a solution for smaller firms with tighter budgets, and is positioned very well in this respect.\nHowever, don\u2019t get the idea that this is a barebones service offering \u2013 in fact Ooma Office gives you all the core features you would expect in a general business phone service, plus some more advanced functions like a virtual receptionist that allows for calls to be automatically directed to the right department.\nSubscribers also benefit from hold and transfer music, and Ooma provides mobile apps for iOS and Android, so you can set up capabilities such as call forwarding, enabling calls to be sent from your desk phone to your mobile when you\u2019re out and about. That said, some of the online feedback about the mobile apps isn\u2019t great, so bear that in mind.\nGenerally speaking, though, Ooma gives you a lot of functionality for a relatively modest outlay, with the exception of CRM integrations.\nRead our full Ooma Office review.\nBest basic UCaaS provider\nReasons to buy\nThe 8x8 eXperience Communications Platform offers cloud communication software that acts as a full UCaaS platform, with even the most basic plan offering a good range of communication channels options and collaboration opportunities. For the security conscious, the service is also compliant with HIPAA and GDPR standards.\nThe platform is provided in four distinct service tiers, starting with the 8x8 Express option which includes all the basic features you'd expect, such as secure HD audio, call handling, auto-attendant, voicemail, team messaging, video meetings and screen sharing, as well as integrations for Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) and Microsoft 365.\nThe next pricing tier, X Series X2, adds call recordings and automated transcription, Single Sign On (SSO), as well as unlimited internet fax and additional team features. After that, the X Series plans go through X4, X6, to X8, each tier adding increased functionality that better service enterprise interests, especially in terms of admin and management on top of improved call minutes and country calling options.\nEven still, the more basic 8x8 Express does deliver a strong entry-level plan with a comprehensive range of features that could be attractive to small businesses and start-ups, though the higher tiers may not be so price-competitive as alternatives.\nRead our full 8x8 review.\nBest UCaaS provider for features\nReasons to buy\nGoToConnect represents the merger of LogMeIn's Jive VoIP platform and their GoTo conferencing platform into a single service offering that provides a comprehensive range of features.\nThis, of course, includes unified communications through the bringing together of VoIP calls and messaging, as well as web, audio and video conferencing, helping to create a complete package.\nGeneral features include custom call routing, team-based call distribution, as well as time-based and geolocation routing to ensure that calls are picked up fast. Screen sharing and personal meeting rooms are a standard part of the package, and users can easily join in with a single click rather than wait around or have to generate a PIN.\nWhat's even better is that rather than have differently priced plan levels with an increasing range of unlocked features, GoToConnect has a single pricing system based on the number of users. This could be especially welcome to small and medium-sized businesses who can enjoy all of the same features as an enterprise would, but without having to pay extra for the privilege.\nAltogether, GoToConnect advertises itself as a unified communications and collaboration platform, that will surely work well for a lot of business set ups.\nRead our full GoToConnect review.\nBest UCaaS provider for value for money\nReasons to buy\nDialpad offers a feature-rich platform even at the most basic level. The basic Standard tier offers unlimited calling across the US and Canada, as well as international service in 50+ countries. There are also local and toll-free numbers included, as well as unlimited SMS, MMS, and group texting.\nCall handing and forward are included as standard, including operator routing, custom hold music, and call summaries available to share.\nGroup messaging, chat, call history, and analytics are also included in the Standard tier, as well as SSO, integration with Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) and Microsoft 365. Pricing is extremely competitive.\nThe Pro tier adds real-time call transcriptions, more advanced analytics, as well as integrations with SalesForce, Zendesk, Slack, and Hubspot - among others. An Enterprise version is available, though this requires a custom quote for a bespoke service.\nAll in all, though, Dialpad really offers value for money, but where it lets itself down is by providing video conferencing as a separate service. While there is a free tier, it's limited to 45 minutes, though it's good to see it bundled with the Talk offering for a full UCaaS experience.\nRead our full Dialpad review.\nWe've also featured the best business phone system.\nBest UCaaS provider FAQs\nWhich UCaaS provider is best for you?\nWhen deciding which of the best UCaaS providers to use, first consider what actual needs you have. For example, someone simply wanting to talk to a handful of people on a casual basis may find a simpler VoIP option is the most cost-effective while providing all of the necessary tools that would be required.

      "text": "Best VoIP provider of 2025\nMake phone calls through the internet\nWe list the best VoIP providers, to make it simple and easy to set up a software-based phone system you can use in the office or when remote working.\nVoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) has become an integral feature for modern business communications, and is replacing the familiar landline. The reasons are simple: VoIP is easy to set up for office, remote working, and mobile device use; VoIP can deliver on productivity integrations and analytics; and even better is that VoIP has all features of an advanced PBX phone system but at a fraction of the cost.\nThere's a lot to consider when choosing a VoIP service provider, and the best for one business isn't necessarily best for another. Therefore, we've picked the best VoIP services based on ease of management, useful features, and practicality as a business phone system using VoIP.\nWe've made recommendations based on different use-cases and different business sizes and types. Knowing what you need from your VoIP service before you set out to look is key, so you may want to read our article: How to choose a small business VoIP phone service before you proceed, or keep reading for some general advice.\nBelow we'll list what we think are the best VoIP providers currently available.\nWe've also featured the best VoIP phone and best VoIP headset.\nThe best VoIP providers of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest VoIP provider overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRingCentral is a great all-rounder for businesses, regardless of industry. It's a cloud-based PBX platform that includes all the features that modern organizations have come to expect from their VoIP system: video software, collaboration tools, and even AI capabilities.\nAll the core features are included, such as an auto-attendant system, a company directory, call forwarding and handling, and multiple extensions. A 99.999% uptime SLA also means that businesses can have peace of mind that any disruptions to their communications network are going to be infrequent affairs.\nThere is also a range of pricing plans to choose from, starting with the Essentials plan for small to medium-sized businesses, and includes unlimited voice and video calling, a free local and toll-free number, and 1500 toll-free minutes but the limit of 20 users is unlikely to be enough for some firms.\nFortunately, RingCentral\u2019s plans for larger businesses are where the solution really comes into its own. The Standard plan comes with no limits on user numbers, while the Premium offering also comes with automatic call recording, real-time analytics, and integrations with some of the best CRM software like Salesforce, Zendesk, and more.\nFor organizations that need the most advanced VoIP solutions, the Ultimate package, also comes with device status reports and unlimited storage. Whatever plan businesses plump for, the scalability of RingCentral MVP is one of its most important benefits. With APIs available in the backend, this is a VoIP solution that can be scaled and customized accordingly into a full-scale unified communications solution as well as a cloud contact center.\nRead our full RingCentral MVP review.\nBest affordable VoIP provider\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPerhaps the first thing to notice about the 8x8 eXperience Communications Platform is its price tag. For an enterprise-standard VoIP service, its base offering is very affordable, which is ideal for any organization that feels like it is currently spending too much on its communication tools.\nThe 8x8 Express Plan comes with unlimited video conferencing, chat, calling, and SMS messages across the US and Canada and a bespoke app to manage all your business communications. As a sweetener, the plan also comes with a one-month free trial, plus three months of Wix Unlimited so small businesses can get started with their website building plans as well.\nFor businesses that need more features than those on offer with the Express plan, the X Series X2 plan provides unlimited calling within 14 countries, video and audio conferencing, SMS, MMS and Teams chat functionality, and various enterprise integrations, including Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Outlook, NetSuite, Salesforce and ZenDesk.\nThe X Series X4 plan, meanwhile, adds unlimited calling within 47 countries, call quality reporting, and supervisor analytics. Additional plans are designed to cater for voice-focused contact centers and multichannel associates.\nIt is worth noting that the 8x8 eXperience Communications Platform does not offer a bargain basement service \u2013 and higher-level plans can come at a significant cost. Aside from the great affordability provided by 8x8's more basic plans, all the company's solutions also make great collaboration tools. A universal team messaging application allows businesses to collaborate internally as well as with clients and vendors and includes extensive interoperability with third\u2013party solutions.\nRead our full 8x8 review.\nBest VoIP provider for features\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWith all of the VoIP solutions featured in this guide, there is a multitude of different features on offer, depending on the particular pricing plan that businesses decide to go for. What makes GoTo Connect so impressive is the sheer number of features available, with the platform offering businesses more than 100 calling, collaboration, and mobile features and tools, as well as several video conferencing services.\nAll of the general features, including custom call routing, team-based call distribution, as well as time-based and geolocation routing, are included, and customers also have access to personal meeting rooms.\nAdvertising itself as a UCaaS solution, businesses don\u2019t need to install any new equipment and GoTo Connect will handle all maintenance and upgrades. That being said, the company does recommend that customers have a business-standard router, an Ethernet switch capable of Quality of Service, and a firewall configured to allow access to HTTP, HTTPS, and UDP traffic on their network.\nInterestingly, unlike most VoIP service providers, GoTo Connect does not charge businesses more for additional features. Instead, the company\u2019s pricing plan varies based on how many employees a business has. Prices range from $29.95 per user, per month for customers with between one and four users, to as little as $19.95 per user, per month for businesses with between 50 and 99 users. All pricing plans come with access to the majority of GoTo Connect\u2019s tools, and bespoke pricing plans are available for businesses with more than 100 members of staff.\nAmong the available features are Cloud PBX, custom hold music, call management, advanced ring strategies, and one-click screen sharing. Of course, more features do mean a greater potential for things to go wrong, but GoTo Connect also offers extensive email and call support should any issues arise.\nRead our full GoTo Connect review.\nBest VoIP provider for unlimited calls\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you\u2019re considering cloud-based communication for your employees and customers, Nextiva certainly has many points in its favor, including flexible pricing plans and a range of features to match many of its rivals.\nYou can make unlimited calls to any phone in the US or Canada, and its real-time presence feature also allows you to see which of your contacts is currently available, while the call queue allows you to handle calls during busy times. Video conferencing is available with all plans, and Nextiva allows you to share screens and files during your conferences. You can also use Nextiva\u2019s video function to livestream virtual events and webinars.\nOther features include that voicemail messages can be delivered directly to your email inbox, and the software also gives you the ability to record your outgoing voicemail message. You can also send and receive an unlimited number of text messages, and you can send and receive unlimited faxes.\nNextiva's system has clearly been designed with usability and functionality in mind. By dividing its tools on the basis of communication, sales, and service, the company allows you to find the features you need as soon as you log in.\nThere are also various integrations available, such as for Outlook and Google Contacts, as well as for Salesforce, Hubspot, and Zendesk on the Professional plan.\nOne of the biggest selling points could lie in the option for a free trial. If you\u2019re still undecided, it might be worth signing up for the trial to see if Nextiva is the right solution for your organization.\nRead our full Nextiva VoIP services review.\nBest VoIP provider for remote workers\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSoftware has changed the nature of telephone communications in many offices and this is particularly evident when using Dialpad. The VoIP solution is cost-effective and well-designed and is particularly suited to businesses that have workflows favorable to using softphones \u2013 software applications that are installed on internet-connected devices in order to make phone calls.\nThe company\u2019s VoIP offering, actually called Dialpad Talk, uses cloud calling and AI to boost employee productivity and flexibility. Members of staff can work from anywhere and use any device for their business conversations, and AI-powered voice intelligence can be used to automating note-taking and detect customer sentiments during a call.\nUser setup is straightforward as Dialpad comes with one central administrator portal that makes it easy to add new users, assign them phone numbers, connect them with office suites like Google Workspace and Microsoft 365, and establish their permissions. The whole process should only take a few minutes and either a desktop interface or smartphone app can be used to manage user profiles day-to-day.\nWhile remote working has certainly become more common of late, Dialpad remains compatible with many desk-based phones, and the company has also partnered with Jabra and Poly to integrate functionality with a number of headsets.\nPrice-wise, Dialpad Talk is extremely competitive, and there is an option to include integration with the identity management platform Okta.\nRead our full Dialpad review.\nBest VoIP provider for spam filtering\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-VoIP offers both residential and business VoIP solutions, with its business offering proving particularly useful for companies on a budget. Companies gain access to HD call quality and more than 40 features across 1-VoIP\u2019s metered plan. With this plan, customers only pay for what they use, facing an additional charge of 2 cents per minute for any calls made.\nAll features are included with each business plan, with extension-to-extension calling, digital call forwarding, and cell phone redirection available at no extra cost. Other useful features include the use of an auto attendant to make sure callers are redirected to the correct department, and custom pre-recorded announcements that can be adapted for each particular recipient.\nOne of the most useful aspects of the 1-VoIP solution is its integration with the third-party anti-spam service Nomorobo. So far, this solution has been used by organizations to block more than 2 billion automated spam calls. The service is flexible, allowing companies to toggle the feature on and off, and businesses can report new spam numbers to the service for review. The service is also continuously monitored so calls from essential services like schools and pharmacies are always permitted.\nA few frustrating aspects of the 1-VoIP service have been pointed out by users, particularly in terms of the setup and configuration. Finding the right settings for international calling can be challenging, for example, and there\u2019s not much in the way of integration with CRM solutions. Nevertheless, 1-VoIP is a good choice for businesses that want a fairly standard VoIP solution that will prevent telemarketers from pestering their employees.\nRead our full 1-VoIP review.\nBest VoIP provider for small business\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAffordably priced and with a couple of different plans to choose from, Ooma Office is a great choice for smaller firms or businesses that have a sizable number of remote workers.\nThe basic plan comes with a mobile app, a virtual receptionist, call-forwarding functionality, and a host of other features. Ooma Office Pro adds video conferencing tools, voicemail transcription, and a number of other useful business features.\nThe offering is particularly useful for companies with remote workers, with both the mobile and desktop apps allowing workers to make and receive unlimited calls within the US using their business number.\nAnother particularly handy feature is Ring Groups, which allows organizations to group extensions together so they all ring simultaneously. The call is then simply transferred to whichever employee answers first.\nAlthough the fact that video conferencing only comes with the more expensive pro plan may disappoint some businesses, Ooma Office still represents a great choice for firms that may not need the flashiest VoIP solution.\nRead our full Ooma Office review.\nBest VoIP provider for legacy hardware\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTelecoms giant AT&T may be one of the older players in the communication space but that hasn\u2019t stopped it from adopting the most up-to-date developments in the VoIP market. In particular, what makes AT&T Business so unique is the way that it integrates with legacy systems. AT&T Collaborate supports prebuilt integration with approximately 30 external services, including Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft 365, and various Salesforce offerings, and existing analog office phones can continue to be used.\nAlthough new registrations are no longer being taken for AT&T Collaborate, AT&T Office@Hand is a flexible cloud-based solution delivering voice, fax, and text messaging options, as well as audio and video conferencing features. The solution is cloud-based and comes with three pricing plans.\nThe Standard Edition includes unlimited internet faxing, 1000 toll-free minutes per month, and allows unlimited user numbers. The Premium Edition also comes with Salesforce integration and 200 HD video seats. Prices for the Enterprise Edition vary but all customers will receive 10,000 toll-free minutes a month.\nWhile AT&T does allow businesses to use their own hardware for the Office@Hand service, providing it is compatible, the company will not be able to provide help desk support. Instructions will be provided on how to configure the equipment but that is unlikely to completely prevent difficulties from arising, so it\u2019s a good idea for businesses to employ experts during the installation process.\nOnce installation and configuration are out of the way, however, AT&T Business is simplicity personified. Each employee is given their own unique extension and direct-dial number for voice, fax, and text messaging.\nRead our full AT&T Business review.\nBest lightweight VoIP provider\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAcquired by remote access solutions provider LogMeIn in 2018, Grasshopper delivers a great VoIP service for smaller firms, particularly those that may not have the financial resources to invest in additional hardware. With Grasshopper, businesses simply gain access to a PBX software instance that connects extensions to existing phone numbers. Businesses only need a functioning phone number, existing handsets (which includes cell phones), and a reliable internet connection.\nBut while the requirements for Grasshopper are slight, the number of features on offer are also somewhat limited. There is no analytics here, nor the kind of advanced features needed to support call centers or VoIP desktop phones. Customers do gain access to an unlimited number of business calls and texts, call forwarding options, and 24/7 support but beyond that, there\u2019s not much to say about the Grasshopper solution.\nFortunately, the pricing is very favorable, with a Solo-tier for one number and three extensions. The Partner tier, on the other hand, offers three numbers and six extensions, whole the Small Business tier comes with up to five numbers and an unlimited number of extensions. Unlike most VoIP providers, Grasshopper\u2019s prices aren\u2019t charged on a per-user basis. These are all-in monthly costs, which means small businesses could face a significantly smaller bill.\nAside from the price, the ease of setup is another bonus of the Grasshopper solution, with users simply selecting their service level and choosing their numbers before the service is ready to go. There\u2019s also a desktop, iOS, and Android app for easy management of Grasshopper\u2019s features.\nRead our full Grasshopper review.\nBest VoIP provider for Microsoft Teams\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMicrosoft\u2019s many digital solutions are already commonplace in offices all over the world and the company now has a cloud telephony service to add to its portfolio. Microsoft Teams Phone lets organizations make calls from any device to anywhere in the world, leveraging the company\u2019s cloud services to ensure high levels of reliability and good audio quality.\nIn terms of pricing, Microsoft Teams Phone works out to be very affordable - particularly if subscribers are already paying for Microsoft 365. It includes a cloud-based phone system with advanced features such as call transfer, multi-level auto attendants, and call queues, as well as 24/7 customer support.\nPerhaps the most attractive feature of Microsoft Teams Phone is the way that it integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Teams. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Teams has become increasingly important to businesses and many will no doubt appreciate the ease with which Microsoft Teams Phone connects to the platform. Setup is quick and it is easy to view upcoming Teams meetings and connect to discussions via your VoIP handset.\nThe major drawback for users of Microsoft Teams Phone is that it comes with a user limit of 300, which makes the service suitable for small to medium-sized businesses (SMB) only. Nevertheless, if that\u2019s not an issue, then Microsoft Teams Phone represents a great option, particularly for firms that already rely on a number of other Microsoft solutions.\nRead our full Microsoft Teams Phone review.\nBest VoIP provider FAQs\nLooking for a VoIP phone or VoIP service provider and not sure where to start? Read these first:\n\u260e How to choose a small business VoIP phone service\n\ud83d\udcde VoIP vs PBX: How to choose which business phone system is right for you\n\u2714 Get a quote for a business phone system today\n\u2757 Easy mistakes your business could make when choosing a VoIP system\nDo you need VoIP provider services or VoIP hardware?\nIt can be easy to mix up the two when you've just started your search, but answering this question early on will help you find the best VoIP provider for your business faster.\nWhile VoIP hardware refers to the phone handsets themselves, VoIP service providers actually deal with the establishment and routing of calls over a high-speed internet connection.\nMany VoIP service providers also provide additional telephony features. Often, these features can transform a standalone business VoIP solution into a unified communications (UC) platform, with functions specifically designed for business communication.\nTop VoIP service providers for business\nSome of the best known VoIP service providers include Aircall, Avaya, Vonage, and RingCentral, in addition to well-known tech firms like Microsoft and Google.\nThese companies may list their solutions as VoIP services, VoIP business phone systems, or cloud phone systems. Ultimately, these terms all mean using a broadband internet connection to make a voice call instead of a regular (or analog) phone line.\nContinues below...\nWhat is VoIP and how does it work?\nLet's start with the basics. VoIP, or Voice over Internet Protocol, is a technology that enables voice communications to be transmitted via an internet connection rather than through a traditional phone network.\nVoIP works in much the same way as a conventional phone system, but it\u2019s usually much more affordable and easier to scale.\nVoIP technology also comes with a suite of benefits that traditional phone systems don\u2019t. For example, it enables you to make or receive calls from virtually any device, in any location, as long as you have an internet connection. Use your smartphone, tablet, computer, or even dedicated VoIP hardware to stay in touch at all times.\nMany VoIP systems also come with several advanced features, such as simple call routing, advanced on-hold messages, and multiple phone numbers.\nAt the higher end of the spectrum, many VoIP packages are equipped with integrated tools, such as online fax, integrated email marketing, and video conferencing.\nThe benefits of VoIP\nThese are some of the most common features offered by VoIP providers. They usually come as standard, although some will only be included in more expensive packages.\nVideo and audio conferencing\nMany VoIP handsets come with screens and cameras built-in, so it\u2019s possible to video conference right from a desk, without having to use a laptop. Audio conferencing can be a much more convenient option, especially when not every call participant has access to a camera-enabled phone.\nVoicemail\nWhether you work with a traditional phone system or VoIP, voicemail has become an essential part of our working lives. The great thing about VoIP voicemail is that you can access it anywhere and from any supported device, such as a cell phone or laptop. You need never miss an important call again.\nScreen sharing\nScreen sharing is perfect for viewing (and controlling) a colleague\u2019s computer for collaboration purposes and for helping a customer with a technical or sales issue. Integration is simple and the sharer doesn\u2019t even need to download any additional software.\nHome/mobile working\nBecause VoIP works with the internet, your VoIP phone account can be accessed on any supported device: typically using an app on your phone, laptop, or tablet. This means you can make and receive calls to and from your VoIP number whether you\u2019re working from home or visiting a client.\nCRM integration\nCRM has become a vital tool for businesses for tracking interactions with customers and clients. VoIP CRM integration can help you manage customer relationships more efficiently through real-time call tracking, analyze customer behavior for marketing purposes, and provide a better customer experience.\nCall monitoring\nWith VoIP, voice (and fax) communications can be stored as digital data packets - this makes monitoring calls straightforward and efficient. Call monitoring keeps business standards high, enabling managers to monitor performance and compliance, reduce liability, and apply training accordingly.\nAdvanced call routing\nVoIP\u2019s advanced call routing can direct inbound calls to any person or team in real-time. This means that you can easily communicate business hours, manage long wait times by offering an option to leave a voice message, and easily scale your call center as your team grows.\nCall recording\nWith VoIP you can record any call, making note-taking a thing of the past. Incoming and outgoing calls are stored on the cloud, meaning they can be accessed from anywhere. You don\u2019t even need to record from the beginning to get the entire call - you can choose to keep a recording of the call at any point in the call.\nOn-hold music and messaging\nNo one likes to be kept on hold in silence, so using the right on-hold music can help reassure people in line, and is an opportunity for you to promote offers and advise on services. On-hold music is usually offered by a VoIP provider, but you can also use third-party plug-ins to expand your musical options.\nHow much does VoIP cost?\nThe cost of a VoIP system can vary immensely. Numerous basic free solutions are available, and premium plans can range from a few dollars per year into the hundreds or even thousands per month for businesses with high-end requirements.\nMost VoIP service providers offer unlimited voice and video calling, along with unlimited SMS to numbers in specified parts of the world. Subscriptions are usually offered on a per-user basis, which means that you can expect to pay more if you need support for more team members.\nSome providers do offer all-in-one solutions that support a specified number of users for one price, but this payment model isn\u2019t all that common.\nExpect to pay extra for advanced features, integrations with certain third-party platforms, and international calling options.\nThe five best VoIP phone services compared\nVoIP service | Pricing | Features | Support |\n|---|---|---|---|\nFrom $19.99 / \u00a37.99 per user/mo | Integrated phone, video conferencing, and messages; RingCentral app | Live chat, support case, app integration, knowledge base | |\nFrom $19.99 /user/mo | Mobile app, ring groups, video conferencing (Pro plan-only) | Live chat, knowledge base, 24/7 phone | |\nFrom $18.95 per user/mo | HD phone, app, team chat, conversational AI | Live chat, knowledge base, ticketing | |\nFrom $14 / \u00a312 per user/mo | Call and routing, video conferencing (+ mobile app), voice intelligence | Live chat, knowledge base | |\nFrom $15 per user/mo | Cloud phone, chat, video conferencing | Live chat, knowledge base |\nLooking for more information about VoIP? Our FAQ will help you understand the benefits of VoIP solutions for businesses of all sizes.\nWhat equipment do I need for VoIP?\nThe only equipment you need for a VoIP system is a strong internet connection and a device that can connect to the internet.\nMost service providers offer some sort of mobile and/or desktop app which you can download and use to manage incoming and outgoing calls and messages. On top of this, many VoIP platforms feature a powerful web interface, enabling users to log in from any device with an internet connection.\nHowever, many businesses opt to add extra VoIP hardware. Specialized phone systems, headsets, and even things like PC handsets are available to streamline business workflows and maximize the efficiency of your VoIP.\nSpeak with your VoIP service provider to find out more about the available hardware options.\nIs VoIP free?\nThere are numerous free VoIP solutions available, but most of these are targeted at personal users rather than businesses, and they tend to come with quite limited features. Popular examples of free VoIP services include messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, and more.\nMany people go with free VoIP apps because they are simple, easy to download and set up, and in general, more than adequate for basic personal use. However, they tend to be a little limited when it comes to advanced features for business, which is why we often recommend a premium solution.\nOne major drawback with free VoIP apps is that everyone has to be using the same application. You can\u2019t use WhatsApp to call Skype or vice versa, for example. And in most cases, a paid solution is required if you want to call phone numbers directly.\nIn terms of advanced business features, most free solutions lack even basic tools such as call recording, simple data collection, and on-hold messages, which will likely be a major concern for many corporate users.\nSo, while free VoIP options are available, business users will generally be much better serviced by a premium solution.\nHow does a VoIP phone number work?\nFor all practical purposes, a VoIP phone number is identical to a traditional landline or cell phone number. It enables you to call any landline or mobile number, send SMS messages, and access other advanced features.\nThe main difference between a VoIP number and a traditional phone number is that a VoIP number isn\u2019t linked to a specific phone line or SIM card. Rather, it\u2019s linked to a user and can be accessed from virtually any device with an internet connection.\nWhat are the disadvantages of VoIP?\nDespite its rapid growth as a business phone technology, VoIP has its disadvantages over traditional phone systems. With a good VoIP setup, these will generally be minor, but it\u2019s still important to be aware of them.\nFor one, all VoIP systems require a strong internet connection. If your connection is slow or unstable, your phone system will likely suffer. You may have trouble making or receiving calls, which can impact general business processes.\nAdditionally, you need to ensure your connection has low latency. This basically means that there shouldn\u2019t be major delays in either transmitting or receiving VoIP data, or else your system will be hindered.\nAnother minor consideration is that your VoIP devices will need to have a reliable power source. Many traditional phones don\u2019t require consistent mains power, and most others consume very small amounts of energy. However, VoIP devices can\u2019t be used if there\u2019s a power outage, which means that you may need to consider installing some form of backup supply.\nFinally, not all VoIP systems are secure. Ensure you\u2019re using a reliable service provider to reduce the risk of hacking, viruses, and serious data loss.\nWhat are the advantages of VoIP?\nAlthough it has its disadvantages, the advantages of using a VoIP system usually outweigh these.\nThe cost savings associated with setting up and using a new VoIP system, compared to a traditional business phone network, are probably top of the list. Infrastructure costs are significantly lower, as are recurring service costs.\nAnother clear advantage is the flexibility that VoIP offers. Let\u2019s say, for example, that you\u2019ve had to leave the office early for some reason. If you have your VoIP app installed on your smartphone, you can continue to make and receive important calls as long as you have an internet connection.\nSimilarly, you will be able to log in to your VoIP interface from your personal computer if required. Team members can also work remotely without relying on hardwired phone systems, which significantly improves business flexibility.\nFurthermore, VoIP systems are highly scalable, which makes them a great option for fast-growing companies. It\u2019s extremely easy to add new users without having to purchase expensive hardware, which is a feature that many businesses will find attractive.\nFinally, most VoIP systems come with significantly more advanced features than traditional phone systems. Things like call forwarding and automated attendants are extremely easy to set up. You\u2019ll also often have access to advanced video conferencing and messaging tools, and you\u2019ll be able to select local phone numbers for virtually anywhere in the world.\nHow do you call a VoIP number?\nTo call a VoIP number, follow the same steps as you would to call a landline or mobile number. VoIP phone systems function in practically the same way as traditional systems, enabling users to send and receive calls and SMS messages.\nOne thing to note here is the country and area codes of VoIP numbers. Firstly, just because an individual or company has a number with a certain area code doesn\u2019t mean that they live or operate there. In fact, many businesses have local numbers across the world to make it easier for clients to contact them.\nOn top of this, you\u2019ll need to be mindful if you\u2019re calling a VoIP number from a landline or cell phone. Otherwise, you may end up placing an international call which could become very costly.\nCan I text a VoIP number?\nYes, you can text a VoIP number.\nTexting them is exactly the same as texting a normal cell phone. The VoIP user will receive your texts via their user interface, on a smartphone, tablet, PC, or specialized hardware.\nVoIP technical terms explained\nBandwidth\nIn a VoIP context, your system\u2019s bandwidth refers to the amount of data that can be transferred at any given time. It\u2019s usually measured in bits per second and provides important insights into the capability of your network. Larger networks with more users will naturally require a higher bandwidth.\nCodec\nCodec is a technical term that refers to the software used to compress and decompress VoIP data. Different systems use different VoIP codecs, and these play a large role in determining your system\u2019s bandwidth and audio quality.\nDSL\nDSL, or Digital Subscriber Line, refers to one of the most popular types of VoIP installation. It uses existing copper telephone lines to establish a broadband internet connection, transmitting audio and video data through a DSL router or modem.\nIP\nInternet Protocol (IP) telephony refers to the various technologies that form the basis of modern VoIP solutions. These are used to transmit voice, fax, and other data from a VoIP device to the traditional phone network and vice versa.\nIVR\nIVR, or Interactive Voice Response, refers to software that delivers automatic audio information to callers. With this, you can set up keypad-controlled menus, enabling callers to connect with the most appropriate team members with a minimum amount of fuss.\nLatency\nThe term latency is often used interchangeably with lag. In layman\u2019s terms, it refers to the time it takes for data to transmit. Slow internet connections generally have high latency, which decreases as your connection gets faster.\nPBX\nA PBX, or Private Branch Exchange, is designed to manage a company or organization\u2019s internal phone systems. In a VoIP context, you will often see the acronym IP PBX, which essentially manages extensions, fax systems, and every other aspect of your phone system.\nRTP\nReal-Time Transfer Protocol (RTP) is designed to enable the streamlined transmission of audio and video data. Its main purpose is to ensure all data has a temporal reference, making sure audio and video transmissions are fully synchronized at all times.\nSIP Trunking\nSession Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking is used to transfer voice and other data over an internet connection. In simple terms, it enables VoIP users to connect with traditional phone users, providing a bridge between the two different systems.\nSoftphone\nThe term softphone is used to describe any app or other program that enables you to use a mobile device or computer as a phone system. Usually, softphone interfaces come with everything you need to manage incoming and outgoing calls and messages.\nVoIP\nVoIP, or Voice over Internet Protocol, is the base technology underlying internet phone systems. With it, users can make and receive calls from virtually any device with an internet connection. VoIP systems are generally much more affordable than traditional phone systems, which makes them attractive to businesses across the world.\nWhich type of VoIP service is best for you?\nWhen deciding which of the best VoIP providers to use, first consider what actual needs you have. For example, someone simply wanting to talk to a handful of people on a casual basis may find a budget option is the most cost-effective while providing all of the necessary tools that would be required. However, if you're planning to use a VoIP provider for professional or business purposes, especially with a large number of people and on a regular basis, then you will probably want to look to the higher-end options for the more advanced tools that are included.\nHow we tested the best VoIP providers\nTo test for the best VoIP providers we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service with VoIP and video calling, as well as the range of administration tools available. The aim was to see how user-friendly its features were, and also how easy it was to get to grips with any advanced options.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nLearn more about the VoIP systems and phones\nLooking for more information on VoIP services?
