      "feedback": "Your draft is on the right track but still falls short of the “world‑class” standard Argos demands. 1) **Depth & Causal Chain** – You mention a Fed cut, political pressure, and a steepening curve, but you never quantify the magnitude of each driver or show how they interact numerically (e.g., a 25 bp Fed cut → 10 bp drop in 2‑yr yields → 0.3 % DXY move).  Add a simple transmission table or equation and cite the specific source IDs (e.g., FAN5RYW6T for labor‑market weakness, Z7O1DCHS7 for the 57 bp spread). 2) **Alignment with Horizon** – The draft mixes 3‑month and 6‑month language; tighten to a single 3–6‑month window and explicitly state the “next 3–6 months” in the base case. 3) **Scenario Structure** – You mention “base case” and “alternatives” but only outline one alt (Fed delay).  Include a second alt (e.g., inflation spike) with its own catalyst window and outcome. 4) **Quantification** – Replace vague “1–2 % decline” with a range tied to specific catalysts (e.g., 0.8–1.5 % if September cut occurs; 0.3–0.6 % if cut delayed). 5) **Citation Density** – Every claim must have an inline (ID) reference.  For example, “sticky inflation (core PCE 2.9% July)” should cite FAN5RYW6T.  6) **Avoid Drift** – The paragraph about “commodities and equities” is tangential; either tie it back to dollar flows with a citation or remove it.  7) **Actionable Signals** – List concrete watch signals with dates: e.g., “Fed minutes (Sept 5), 2‑yr/10‑yr spread (weekly), Trump‑Fed lawsuit status (ongoing).”  8) **Confidence Rating** – End with a concise confidence score (e.g., “Moderate (70%)”) and explain the basis.  Apply these edits to produce a concise, evidence‑driven, market‑mapped view that satisfies the 3–6‑month horizon and Argos’ strict formatting.",
