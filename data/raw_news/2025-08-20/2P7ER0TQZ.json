  "description": "Michael Fiddelke, 49, currently Target\u2019s chief operating officer, will take the helm Feb. 1, 2026.",
  "content": "Target shares tanked 7% after it tapped a longtime insider as its new chief executive \u2013 sorely disappointing investors who had hoped the struggling \u201ccheap chic\u201d retailer would lure a retail guru from outside.\n\nMichael Fiddelke, the 49-year-old chief operating officer of the \u201ccheap chic\u201d retailer, will take the helm Feb. 1 to replace CEO Brian Cornell who will step into the board\u2019s executive chairman role, the company said Wednesday.\n\nCornell, 66, who led the company for a decade, said: \u201cThere is no one better suited to move Target forward than Michael Fiddelke.\u201d\n\nBut investors had been hoping for an outside executive to take over the flailing chain, which has reported dismal results in recent quarters and lost ground to big-box rival Walmart.\n\nAs a 20-year Target veteran who previously served as chief financial officer, Fiddelke will be forced to tackle a persistent slump in sales \u2014 compounded by backlash from shoppers over a controversial Pride collection including gear for kids and its end of DEI programs.\n\nMeanwhile, rampant shoplifting allegedly doomed Target\u2019s partnership with Ulta to open mini beauty shops in nearly a third of stores.\n\nTarget announced last week that the deal was off.\n\nTarget shares, which have been trading at multiyear lows since the spring, were recently off 7% at $98 after falling more than 10% at the start of trading on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe stock price reflects that there won\u2019t be change when change is needed,\u201d Gerald Storch, former vice chairman of Target and ex-CEO of Toys R Us, told The Post. \u201cThe sales are negative and they are bleeding market share.\u201d\n\nTarget did not immediately respond to The Post\u2019s request for comment.\n\nChristine Leahy, top independent director of Target\u2019s board, said the company has been leading a thorough search \u2013 including external candidates \u2013 for Cornell\u2019s replacement.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how thorough it was,\u201d Storch countered, adding that a lot of outsiders would have wanted the job.\n\n\u201cTarget\u2019s value positioning\u2026should be yielding better results than the low single digit revenue decline we expect for Target this year,\u201d David Silverman, senior director of Fitch Ratings, said Wednesday.\n\nHe nodded to \u201cthe company\u2019s recent execution missteps,\u201d which were \u201cexacerbated by a volatile retail industry.\u201d\n\nIn a press release Wednesday, Fiddelke laid out his three main priorities: increasing Target\u2019s offerings of stylish items, creating a more consistent customer experience and using technology to boost efficiency.\n\nAt the same time, Target reported second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates \u2013 though sales and store and website traffic declined once again.\n\nSame-store sales, which includes sales on its website and stores open at least 13 months, fell 1.9% compared to the same period last year.\n\nCustomer transactions dropped 1.3% and the average amount customers spent during those transactions slipped 0.6% from the year before.\n\nFiddelke said on a post-earnings call that Target\u2019s retail sales trends improved from the previous quarter, even though they were still negative.\n\nHe said sales trends in all six of Target\u2019s key merchandise categories improved from the quarter before.\n\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post\u2019s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between. Subscribe here!\n\nFiddelke said that as leader of the Enterprise Acceleration Office, which Target created in May to speed along its turnaround, he has gotten to take a closer look at where the business is underperforming.\n\nThe retailer lost ground in home goods, for example, as it focused too much on \u201ccore\u201d items and \u201clost some of our fashion and design leadership that\u2019s so important in a category like that.\u201d\n\nTarget has made some progress in turning around its home goods category by adding Disney and Marvel-themed bedding to Pillowfort, its private label for kids\u2019 room decor, Fiddelke said.\n\n\u201cNow, we need more of those examples across the category, but they give me a ton of confidence that we\u2019re on the right path there,\u201d Fiddelke said.",

      "text": "Trump demands Fed Governor Lisa Cook resign amid mortgage fraud allegations\nPresident Trump on Wednesday called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign on the basis of allegations made by one of his political allies about mortgages she holds in Michigan and Georgia, intensifying his effort to gain influence over the central bank.\nTrump has also told aides he is considering attempting to fire her, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing a senior White House official and another person familiar with the matter. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.\nFederal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte alleged in a post on X earlier on Wednesday that Cook had designated a condo in Atlanta as her primary residence after taking a loan on her home in Michigan, which she also declared as a primary residence.\nLoans for a primary residence can carry easier terms than for second homes or investment properties. Pulte said the loans date to mid-2021, before Cook was appointed to the Fed by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate the following year.\nShe is a native of Georgia and at the time was an economics professor at Michigan State University.\nPulte asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate, and Trump quickly amplified the allegation. The Justice Department was taking the matter very seriously, a department official told Reuters.\nSpokespersons for the Fed and for Cook were not immediately available to respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cCook must resign, now!!!\u201d Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform in his latest comments aimed at reshaping the make-up of the central bank, a body designed to set benchmark interest rates independent of White House influence.\nCook is one of three Biden appointees to the Fed whose terms extend beyond Trump\u2019s time in office, complicating the president\u2019s efforts to get more control by appointing a majority of its seven-member board. Currently two of the Fed\u2019s remaining six board members were appointed by Trump, Governor Christopher Waller and Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman.\nTrump has repeatedly blasted Fed Chair Jerome Powell over benchmark rates that he wants sharply reduced, calling for his resignation while acknowledging that the Fed\u2019s unique status in U.S. governance prevents him from firing Fed board members over monetary policy disputes.\nTrump can name a new chair when Powell\u2019s term ends in May, but claiming a majority on the board may take more time. Powell could continue serving as a governor until 2028, near the end of Trump\u2019s term, should he buck convention and continue sitting on the board under a new chair.\nUntil Powell\u2019s departure, Trump at this point has only one other seat to fill, vacated recently by the surprise resignation of former Governor Adriana Kugler. Earlier this month Trump nominated Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran to serve out the rest of her term."

      "text": "Target CEO Brian Cornell steps down after 10 years as retailer fights to reverse sliding sales\nTarget CEO Brian Cornell is stepping down next year after over a decade at the helm as the embattled retailer undertakes a high-stakes turnaround effort aimed at reigniting growth and reversing sliding sales.\nThe Minneapolis-based company\u2019s board of directors unanimously elected Michael Fiddelke, the company\u2019s current chief operating officer, to succeed Cornell and become a member of its Board of Directors on Feb. 1, the company announced Wednesday.\nThe news comes as Cornell, 66, wraps up the three-year commitment he made in 2022 to remain CEO.\nThat year, Target\u2019s board scrapped its mandatory retirement age of 65, allowing him to stay on during a pivotal period for the company as it worked to revive traffic and growth.\nOver the past 20 years at Target, Fiddelke, 49 years old, has been credited with being instrumental in building many of the company\u2019s core strengths, holding leadership roles across merchandising, finance, operations and human resources.\nIn his current position, Target said Fiddelke has overseen efforts that enabled exponential growth across the business, including investments to build and scale the company\u2019s stores, supply chain, digital capabilities and team. He also spearheaded enterprise efforts to deliver more than $2 billion in efficiencies.\n\u201cIt is clear that Michael is the right leader to return Target to growth, refocus and accelerate the company\u2019s strategy, and reestablish Target\u2019s position as a leader in the highly dynamic and fast-moving retail environment,\u201d Christine Leahy, lead independent director of Target\u2019s Board of Directors, said.\nLeahy said Fiddelke\u2019s tenure gives him unmatched enterprise insight and a foundation of strong team trust, noting that \u201cwhat sets him apart is how he combines those strengths with a \u2018fresh eyes\u2019 mindset, challenging the status quo to evolve how the business operates, differentiates and delivers long-term value.\u201d\nIn its latest fiscal quarter, the company reported $25.2 billion in sales, down just under 1% from a year ago.\nThe company blamed the dip on shoppers pulling back on merchandise, though that was partly balanced out by stronger non-merchandise sales, like services.\nSales at stores open at least a year fell nearly 2%, with in-store sales dropping more than 3%. Online sales, however, grew a little over 4%. Overall, profit for the quarter came in at $1.3 billion, which was down about 19% from last year.\nThe company had already warned earlier this year that there would be year-over-year profit pressure in its first quarter relative to the remainder of the year, due in part to tariff uncertainty.\nTo try to get back to long-term profitable growth, the company announced in May that it had developed a new multi-year growth initiative, called Enterprise Acceleration Office, and made changes to its executive suite.\nThe Enterprise Acceleration Office initiative will specifically help the company operate more nimbly, \u201ccreating conditions for speed, adaptability, innovation and resilience,\u201d Cornell said.\nTarget is maintaining its expectation of a low-single digit decline in sales for fiscal 2025, down from its previous forecast of net sales growth of about 1%. It expects adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $7 to $9 for fiscal 2025, down from its prior expectation of $8.80 to $9.80."

      "text": "Discount giant Walmart on Wednesday vowed to keep prices low in order to increase market share despite President Trump\u2019s tariffs on global trading partners \u2013 especially China.\nThe retailer argued that it is particularly well-equipped for the challenge in the face of a 125% tariff on China \u2013 even though Walmart imports 60% of its goods from the Mainland.\n\u201cHistory tells us that when we lean into these periods of uncertainty, Walmart emerges on the other side with greater share and a stronger business,\u201d Walmart CFO John David Rainey said in a press release after the company announced it will stick to its full-year sales and income growth forecasts.\nShares soared nearly 10%.\nThe Arkansas-based company hopes to use its image as an affordable alternative to dominate the retail space, while more expensive rivals may struggle to hold onto customers amid tariff-related costs.\nThat tactic has worked for Walmart in the past. It has outperformed rivals during other economic crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2008 recession, due to its ultra-low prices.\nLast May, as cash-strapped customers cut back on shopping due to sticky inflation, Walmart\u2019s sales jumped \u2013 with the bulk of the gains coming from wealthy households earning $100,000 or more.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned how to manage through turbulent periods,\u201d Walmart CEO Doug McMillion said in comments addressed to a group of investors, analysts and reporters, before Trump announced a 90-day pause of his reciprocal tariffs on all trading partners except China.\n\u201cAnd while we don\u2019t know everything that is going to happen\u2026We do know what our priorities are, and we know what our purpose is, and we\u2019ll be focused on keeping prices as low as we can.\u201d\nChina was facing a 104% tariff when McMillon made his comments \u2013 but Trump upped the levy to 125% because of an 84% retaliatory tax imposed on US goods by Beijing that begins Thursday.\nThe company acknowledged it would face difficulties, saying \u201cthe range of outcomes\u201d for first-quarter operating income growth has widened, due partially to the desire to \u201cinvest in price as tariffs are implemented.\u201d\nIn February, Walmart had forecast full-year sales for the fiscal year ending January 2026 to jump between 3% and 4%, and annual adjusted operating income to rise between 3.5% and 5.5%.\nAt the time, it projected first-quarter adjusted operating income to rise between 0.5% to 0.2%. Walmart did not provide updated figures during the investor meeting.\nIn a statement, McMillon said Walmart is strategizing to serve customers \u201ceven better\u201d on low prices, a broad assortment of goods, a convenient and enjoyable shopping experience and a trustworthy business.\nBehind the scenes, Walmart has reportedly continued to pressure Chinese suppliers to slash their prices \u2013 in effect, bearing the brunt of Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2013 even after the retailer\u2019s executives got a dressing down from Beijing, according to Bloomberg.\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer is still pushing overseas suppliers to cut their prices by as much as 10%\nA spokesperson for the retailer told Bloomberg that the company\u2019s conversations with suppliers are all aimed at delivering lower prices to customers.\nThe Post reached out to Walmart for comment."

      "text": "McDonald\u2019s to slash combo meal prices\u2014 despite clashing with franchisees over surging costs\nMcDonald\u2019s is slashing its combo meal prices \u2014 despite weeks of tussling with restaurant operators who pleaded that rising costs have made it difficult to sustain deals already on the menu.\nIts US franchisees have agreed to keep the cost of eight popular combos 15% below the sum of the individual items\u2019 prices, according to internal materials viewed by the Wall Street Journal.\nA combo meal currently selling for $10, for example, could go for as little as $8.50 under the new discounts.\nThat agreement followed weeks of pressure from McDonald\u2019s, which eventually offered to subsidize possible losses for operators \u2013 but only after accounting for increased traffic the deals might drive to stores, sources involved in the talks said.\nThe world\u2019s largest fast-food chain is on a mission to restore its affordable image following persistent complaints from customers that its menu has grown too expensive, with a Big Mac, fries and drink costing $18 in some places.\nThe company relies heavily on low-income consumers, who visit its restaurants more frequently than middle- and high-income groups, CEO Chris Kempczinski said earlier this month after its second-quarter earnings report.\n\u201cCustomers are telling us they need more of the everyday value and affordability that defines the McDonald\u2019s brand,\u201d Joe Erlinger, head of McDonald\u2019s US business, said in an internal message earlier this month.\nStarting in early September, combos including those featuring the Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Chicken McNuggets, McCrispy sandwich, Egg McMuffin and breakfast sandwiches will be discounted.\nOperators will be required to keep these discounts in place through the start of next year.\nMcDonald\u2019s will also bring back its Extra Value Meals, including a $5 Sausage Egg McMuffin and $8 Big Mac meal in September, as well as a $5 Sausage, Egg and Cheese McGriddle and $8 10-piece Chicken McNuggets meal in November.\nMcDonald\u2019s did not immediately respond to The Post\u2019s request for comment.\nAt most US locations, McDonald\u2019s combo meals are priced below the sum of the items\u2019 individual cost, but the size of that discount varies. Franchisees usually set these prices.\nThe company has been pressuring franchisees to limit price hikes to less visible items on the menu.\n\u201cThe single biggest driver of what shapes a consumer\u2019s overall perception of McDonald\u2019s value is the menu board,\u201d Kempczinski said during an investor call this month.\nIt\u2019s been a battle for the fast-food chain, as operators have in turn pushed McDonald\u2019s to cut deals like $1 drinks from the menu, citing rising costs.\nWhile the chain\u2019s McValue menu helped US same-store sales rebound in the most recent quarter after two periods of steep declines, it still underperformed in terms of customer counts, Erlinger said in his message.\nExecutives blamed part of the slump on McDonald\u2019s menu items that cost $10 and more.\nThe average large Big Mac meal costs $10.53, but that price can go as high as $18.99 at pricier locations, like those located in travel plazas and airports, according to market-research firm Technomic.\nPrices for Big Mac combo meals soared 27% between 2019 and 2024, according to the company.\nBut restaurants from IHOP to Chipotle have been sounding the alarms as stubbornly high prices and economic uncertainty lead Americans to eat at home more.\nTraffic to US restaurants has plunged 1.7% so far this year, and about 2.7% for fast-food chains, according to Black Box Intelligence, a market research firm.\nBoth McDonald\u2019s and its franchisees will fund a marketing campaign to advertise the new deals."

      "text": "Target, Ulta partnership allegedly doomed by out-of-control shoplifting\u2014 including $10k a month at one store\nThe shop-in-shop partnership between Target and Ulta Beauty was allegedly doomed by rampant theft of the cosmetics company\u2019s pricey products \u2014 including at least $10,000 a month at one store.\nThe retail giants last week announced that they\u2019ve \u201cmutually agreed\u201d to terminate their union \u2014 where Ulta\u2019s popular makeup items were sold at 610 Target locations around the country.\nExecs from both companies lauded the \u201csynergy\u201d they enjoyed after joining forces in 2021, but many claiming to be current and former Target workers flooded Reddit to allege that shoplifting was the real culprit behind the partnership\u2019s demise.\n\u201cThe amount of theft is f\u2013king insane. I could be wrong but at least 10k a month in theft,\u201d one purported Target worker in the unnamed store posted on Reddit earlier this year.\nThe complaint echoed those made by others in the r/Target and r/Ulta threads that blamed brazen bandits for snatching Ulta\u2019s high-end cosmetics at understaffed Target stores.\nOrganzied retail theft surged after the pandemic, resulting in major retailers, including Target, being forced to put items under lock and key.\nNevertheless, the security precautions seemingly did little to prevent shoplifting at some locations. One Target worker claimed 40% of all Ulta products received throughout the year had vanished after checking inventory reports.\n\u201cThousands of dollars just in that tiny little beauty section,\u201d the alleged employee wrote under the handle Efficient_Raise.\n\u201cAt my store, it\u2019s the one area with the highest theft.\u201d\nAnother claimed a group of thieves hauled off $8,000 in Ulta merchandise after walking in with trash bags.\nTarget and Ulta did not respond to requests for comment about the shoplifting allegations.\nThey also offered few details behind their decision to pull the plug on the partnership, which will end next August.\nA note by analysts at TD Cowen pointed to \u201cshrink\u201d \u2013 the industry term for lost or stolen merchandise \u2013 as one of the reasons for the \u201cconscious uncoupling,\u201d according to trade publication Retail Dive.\nAnother industry insider suggested Ulta wanted to distance itself from Target\u2019s toxic reputation after the chain was hit by repeated boycotts over Pride merchandise and its decision to scale back controversial DEI policies, Fortune reported.\nThe partnership\u2019s unraveling became public in April when Ulta CEO Kecia Steelman revealed the company would \u201cpause\u201d expanding the mini-stores to \u201cleverage the learnings.\u201d\nRick Gomez, Target\u2019s executive vice president and chief commercial officer, said the retailer is \u201cproud of our shared success\u201d with Ulta.\nTarget \u201cremains committed to offering the beauty experience consumers have come to expect,\u201d he added.\nThe retailer launched 2,000 new beauty products and 50 brands in February. It also added cosmetics to its Bullseye\u2019s Playground discount section."

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21. Terms Pertaining to Certain Third Party Content, Data and Information Providers and Mobile Application Platforms.\n21.1 AP Material. By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications.

      "text": "Target lowered its full-year sales forecast after a tough first quarter marked by weak discretionary spending, tariff pressures and fallout from consumer boycotts stemming from its DEI policies.\nThe Minneapolis-based retailer now expects net sales to fall by a low single-digit percentage, abandoning earlier hopes for a modest increase, the company said in its earnings report Wednesday.\nComparable sales dropped 3.8% in the quarter ended May 3, exceeding Wall Street\u2019s expectations for a decline and stoking doubts about CEO Brian Cornell\u2019s ability to regain momentum after two turbulent years.\n\u201cWe faced several additional headwinds this quarter, including five consecutive months of declining consumer confidence, uncertainty regarding the impact of potential tariffs, and the reaction to the updates we shared on [DEI] in January,\u201d Target CEO Brian Cornell told analysts on an earnings call.\n\u201cI want to be clear that we\u2019re not satisfied with these results,\u201d Cornell added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to drive traffic back into our stores and visits to our site.\u201d\nCornell declined to provide details on potential price increases due to tariffs. Most tariff-related increases could be offset, he said, but acknowledged that raising prices could be a \u201clast resort\nShares of Target fell 3% in early trading Wednesday and are down 27% this year, compared to a modest 1% gain in the broader S&P 500.\nCornell blamed the downturn on an array of challenges, including fragile consumer confidence, reduced discretionary purchases, tariff-driven pricing pressures and public backlash over the company\u2019s decision to scale back diversity initiatives.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to move with a greater sense of urgency,\u201d he said, while pointing to e-commerce as a rare bright spot.\nThe weak performance underscores Target\u2019s vulnerability compared to competitors such as Walmart, which have larger grocery operations that shield them from dips in discretionary spending.\nNearly two-thirds of Target\u2019s sales come from categories like clothing, home d\u00e9cor and other non-essentials \u2014 sectors that remain under pressure as inflation-weary consumers tighten budgets.\nAnalysts say the company has struggled to regain its footing following the post-pandemic demand shifts and persistent inventory mismanagement.\n\u201cWe think it will be more difficult for Target in this environment given tariffs and Walmart\u2019s substantial market share gains,\u201d Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe told Bloomberg News.\nSigns of internal strain are growing. Target announced a leadership shakeup that includes the departure of longtime executive Christina Hennington, once considered a potential successor to Cornell.\nChief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke will head a new \u201cmultiyear acceleration office\u201d tasked with reigniting growth.\nTarget\u2019s woes are not just economic. The brand, once celebrated for its progressive image, has faced boycotts from both ends of the political spectrum after pulling back on diversity-focused initiatives.\nIn May 2023, Target sparked widespread backlash after featuring LGBTQ-themed clothing \u2014 including items for children \u2014 in its Pride Month collection, prompting calls for boycotts from conservative groups.\nThe controversy intensified when the company removed some items and relocated displays, angering both critics of the products and LGBTQ advocates who accused Target of caving to pressure.\nIn January, Target announced a rollback of several DEI initiatives, including ending its Racial Equity Action and Change (REACH) program and ceasing participation in external diversity assessments.\nThis move sparked widespread criticism from civil rights activists and led to a 40-day consumer boycott beginning in March. The backlash also resulted in a class-action lawsuit alleging that Target misled investors about the financial risks associated with its DEI policies.\nTariffs are compounding the retailer\u2019s problems. Executives noted that higher import duties are influencing pricing, even as they avoided directly blaming levies as they did earlier this year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re negotiating with suppliers and adjusting sourcing strategies,\u201d one executive told Bloomberg News, as the company reevaluates inventory and product mix.\nDespite the setbacks, Target is betting that value-driven seasonal events and high-profile partnerships can help rekindle consumer interest.\nChief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez touted the success of a recent collaboration with Kate Spade and strong holiday sales during Valentine\u2019s Day and Easter.\nStill, the company lost share in 20 of 35 merchandise categories last quarter, with only swimwear, flowers, essentials and produce showing gains.\nLooking ahead, Target plans to introduce over 10,000 new items this summer, with prices starting as low as $1.\n\u201cWe recognize we have to win the everyday moment,\u201d Cornell said, \u201cnot just the holiday.\u201d\nWith Post wires"

      "text": "Target said it was axing its DEI policies \u2013 a major reversal for a retailer long known for its outspoken support of LGBTQ and minority rights as corporate \u201cwokeness\u201d rapidly falls out of favor.\nThe Minneapolis-based discount chain said Friday it is \u201cconcluding its three-year diversity, equity and inclusion goals\u201d and will stop its reports to the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality Index, according to an internal memo obtained by The Post.\nTarget also said it was trashing a program focused on carrying more products from black- and minority-owned businesses, as the retailer has been scaling back its LGBTQ Pride collections after a backlash from outraged customers over gay-themed kids\u2019 clothing hurt sales.\n\u201cMany years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,\u201d Kiera Fernandez, Target\u2019s chief community impact and equity officer, said in the memo.\n\u201cAnd as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future \u2013 all in service of driving Target\u2019s growth and winning together,\u201d she added.\nTarget\u2019s DEI goals included hiring and promoting more women and minority employees, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBT people, veterans and people with disabilities.\nWalmart, Meta and McDonald\u2019s have also recently backtracked on their DEI initiatives amid conservative backlash, along with companies like John Deere, Tractor Supply and Harley-Davidson, which have large presences in red states.\nBut for Target \u2013 which operates nearly 2,000 stores across the country and employs more than 400,000 people \u2013 backing off DEI is a stark reversal from its previously \u201cwoke\u201d corporate image.\nJust two years ago, the retailer spurred outrage when it launched a \u201cPride\u201d clothing collection that included LGBTQ-friendly gear for children.\nMajor retailers have faced pressure from activists online, like conservative Robby Starbuck, who has claimed victory over a number of companies rolling back their DEI initiatives, including Walmart.\nShortly after news broke that Target was rolling back its DEI policies, Starbuck posted on X: \u201cBig win coming,\u201d with fire emojis.\n\u201cIt got leaked but I\u2019m making the video now,\u201d he added.\nAfter George Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020, and the ensuing Black Lives Matter protests, major US retailers ramped up their diversity efforts.\nBut a 2023 Supreme Court decision ruling against race-based affirmative action in college admissions has emboldened conservative groups to slap firms with lawsuits based on their DEI policies.\nThis week, President Trump added fuel to the fire when he argued in favor of \u201cmerit-based\u201d policies.\nOn Monday, during his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that aims to end all DEI mandates and policies across the federal government.\nThe following day, he ordered all federal employees working on these policies be put on paid leave while his administration works to shut down their offices."

  "argos_summary": "Target shares fell 7% after announcing that longtime COO Michael Fiddelke will replace CEO Brian Cornell, a move investors had hoped would bring fresh leadership. The retailer is grappling with declining sales, a backlash over its Pride collection and DEI program cuts, and a costly shoplifting\u2011driven end to its Ulta partnership. Despite a Q2 earnings beat, same\u2011store sales and traffic are down, and the company has lowered its full\u2011year sales forecast to a low\u2011single\u2011digit decline. Fiddelke\u2019s priorities include expanding stylish offerings, improving customer experience and leveraging technology, while Target continues to face competitive pressure from Walmart and broader retail headwinds such as tariffs and shifting consumer sentiment.",
