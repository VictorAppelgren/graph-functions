Still, Jones sounds confident that Parsons will stay in Dallas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite sure they\u2019ll get it worked out,\" Jones said on a recent appearance on the Up & Adams Show. \u201cI don\u2019t see Micah playing anywhere else other than Dallas. I think Dallas loves Micah. I think Micah loves Dallas and I think Jerry Jones will get it worked out.\u201d\n\nChris Jones, who held out of the Chiefs\u2019 2023 preseason and first regular season game, probably knows better than most what the Cowboys\u2019 present situation is like.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustration on both sides. I mean, it\u2019s probably frustrating for Jerry. With everything that\u2019s going on, and then the contracts he\u2019s recently given out as an owner. When you\u2019re looking at it from a business standpoint, it\u2019s like, I give all these guys contracts and it doesn\u2019t go as well as well as he wanted to go,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd then you look at it from a player standpoint, who goes out there day in and day out and put their life on the line and do the best they can for organization.\u201d\n\nOnly time will tell if Parsons and Dallas can put their frustrations aside and find a solution like Jones and Kansas City in 2023.\n\nFind more Cowboys coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.",

      "text": "OXNARD, Calif. \u2014 The Cowboys conducted their 15th practice of training camp on Wednesday and with a light practice scheduled for Thursday, it was time for team owner and general manager Jerry Jones to express his thoughts on first-year head coach Brian Schottenheimer and the summer session in general.\n\u201cI think overall the tempo with the camp,\u201d Jones said. \u201cGive Brian Schottenheimer his due there to have that and I\u2019m looking forward to Saturday night [the second preseason game]. They\u2019re back in Dallas. But I\u2019ve liked what we\u2019ve seen so far, and on violence I don\u2019t even want to mention it but we\u2019ve come out in pretty good shape with our injuries, which is always a focal point.\u201d\nJones made a note that second-year offensive lineman Nate Thomas has looked good since taking over for an injured Tyler Guyton (knee) at left tackle and that a pick-six from rush end Sam Williams off a Dak Prescott pass was fitting in several ways.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been real pleased with Thomas,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe\u2019s gotten some real opportunity here and we certainly need that showing up on his part. I like several of the young guys.\u201d\nOn Williams, who tore his ACL in the first training camp practice last year, Jones said: \u201cI like the physicality, the enthusiasm, probably the last play we just saw, No. 54 [Williams] taking that thing to the house and outrunning everybody, probably is a great way to end practice and certainly of his camp.\n\u201cSam is not fragile in terms of mental, but as Michael Irvin said when he had an injury that flashed before him the prospects of not playing again; Michael said it made his career to appreciate what he might miss. I think Sam has had that same realization.\u201d\nThe Cowboys were missing four cornerbacks during the last padded practice on Wednesday. Jones said he\u2019s not concerned about being short at the position because there\u2019s an expectation injured corner Trevon Diggs (knee) will return at some point in September.\n\u201cYes, I think Diggs, hopefully not only as it turns out [might miss] the initial game or games but certainly [not] for the season,\u201d Jones said. \u201cCounting on Diggs to really be a player for us.\u201d\nParsons keep quiet on trade talks\nCowboys pass rusher Micah Parsons didn\u2019t have much to say about his trade request as he came off the practice field on Wednesday.\nAsked by The Dallas Morning News if teams have reached out to the Cowboys about potential trades, Parsons said, \u201cmy mouth\u2019s closed.\u201d\nJerry Jones said he doesn\u2019t expect contract talks to increase with Parsons\u2019 agent when the team breaks camp.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if necessary talks will [restart] but we\u2019ve got a game coming [Saturday vs. Baltimore] and he\u2019s under contract,\u201d Jones said.\nThe Cowboys owner didn\u2019t have a clear answer why talks haven\u2019t restarted with his lead negotiators and Parsons\u2019 agent, David Mulugheta.\n\u201cAgain, really nothing,\u201d Jones said on what\u2019s preventing talks from occurring. Jones also indicated he\u2019s under no deadline to get a deal done.\nParsons is conducting a hold-in during training camp practices and has undergone treatment for back tightness. Cowboys officials, from Schottenheimer to Jones have been positive with Parsons participation.\n\u201cAgain, I\u2019m glad he\u2019s been here,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the team, teammates, but its important for him to pick up all of the coaching and nuances and osmosis is a very big thing and he\u2019s been handling that part of it.\u201d\nPractice observations\nThe last full padded practice had a physical tone throughout, something Schottenheimer has sought the entire training camp. Several players got knocked down by the defense, including receiver Jonathan Mingo, who threw the ball into the face mask of safety Markquese Bell. Safety Donovan Wilson had to hold out from crunching receiver CeeDee Lamb after he made a nice sideline catch. A majority of the defensive players were yelling that Wilson would have made a hard hit on Lamb if this were a live game.\nPlayers are allowed to hit with a thud but not to bring teammates to the ground or to hold up when the potential of a big hit might occur.\nAnother example of this is slot corner Zion Childress\u2019 takedown of running back Deuce Vaughn from behind on a run play. Childress is competing with Kemon Hall for the nickel back spot.\nThe Cowboys have been impressed with linebacker Damone Clark this camp as he got second-team reps at middle linebacker along with Kenneth Murray Jr.\nVaughn got first-team reps again. But as camp is on the cusp of closing, it seems Javonte Williams has the lead as the Week 1 starter at running back. The backup is between Hunter Luepke, Jaydon Blue and Miles Sanders.\nLa\u2019el Collins received some work at right tackle with the third team and Hakeem Adeniji was the left tackle.\nT.J. Bass continued to get work with the second team at center for a second consecutive day.\nEnd Payton Turner (ribs) practiced on Wednesday after leaving practice with his health issue.\nKicker Brandon Aubrey made 5 of 6 field goal attempts going against a slight wind. He made kicks of 33, 24, 35, 39 and 41 yards. He was wide left on a 44-yarder into a strong wind.\nBriefly\nSchottenheimer said the rookies will do a talent show Wednesday night after practice. \u2026 The Cowboys will have a walk-through practice on Thursday.\nFind more Cowboys coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

      "text": "Dallas Cowboys Beat Reporter\nOXNARD, Calif. \u2014 Negotiations between the Cowboys and star pass rusher Micah Parsons have sparked mutual frustration. They hadn\u2019t sparked a line in the sand, however.\nUntil Friday.\nThat\u2019s when Parsons requested a trade from the Cowboys. He announced the news on social media but specifically said his request was made to Cowboys co-owner Stephen Jones.\n\u201cUp to today the team has not had a single conversation with my agent about a contract,\u201d Parsons wrote. \u201cNot one demand has been made by my agent about money, years or anything else. Still I stayed quiet but again after repeated shots at myself and all the narratives I have made a tough decision I no longer want to play for the Dallas Cowboys. My trade request has been submitted to Stephen Jones personally.\u201d\nBe the smartest Cowboys fan. Get the latest news.\nStephen Jones had no comment about the news when asked by The Dallas Morning News. Calls to Parsons and his agent, David Mulugheta, were not returned.\nParsons may be only 26 years old, but it hasn\u2019t taken him long to put himself in the discussion for a historic contract. Only four other players have had more sacks by the time they turned 26. His 52.5 career sacks trail only Hall of Famer Derrick Thomas (58), Cleveland Browns star Myles Garrett (57), eventual Hall of Famer J.J. Watt (57), and Danielle Hunter (54.5).\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones even said recently in an interview with KDFW-TV that Parsons is one of the smartest and most talented players he\u2019s ever seen.\nParsons\u2019 stardom has been certified. His payday felt inevitable. But he is now deviating from a path that other Cowboys homegrown stars have walked before.\nQuarterback Dak Prescott and wide receiver CeeDee Lamb both had tough negotiations with the Cowboys last year before they signed deals. Right guard Zack Martin and running back Ezekiel Elliott both held out before they were paid.\nUp until Friday, it felt like Parsons was ready to follow their paths.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s hard not to take it personally when you know there\u2019s a chain of events of something consistently happening over the course of years, when you see it before through other plays and things,\u201d Parsons said earlier in training camp when asked about his negotiations.\n\u201cI don\u2019t take it personally. I just don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nNow, a trade request has been made. There\u2019s been an escalation in Parsons\u2019 discouragement throughout the offseason, leading to this point.\nJerry Jones and Parsons have long been fans of each other. They\u2019ve watched football games together, including the Super Bowl. Parsons, ever inquisitive, has talked about how he enjoys picking the mind of Jones.\nThe two even met in March to go over a potential contract extension.\n\u201cWe went over every possible detail,\u201d Jones said.\nThe sticking point then and now has been the same. Jerry and Stephen Jones have yet to meet with Parsons\u2019 agent, Mulugheta of Athletes First. The Joneses confirmed July 21 that they still hadn\u2019t had that conversation.\nAt the NFL scouting combine, Mulugheta spoke with Adam Prasifka, the team\u2019s director of salary cap and player contracts. Parsons said earlier in camp that Mulugheta had reached out to Prasifka.\nThere\u2019s also been conversations by both sides about the willingness to get a deal done. Parsons said in a podcast earlier this offseason that he wanted to get a deal done with the Cowboys last season, but they have instead drawn out and \u201ccomplicated\u201d things.\nRecently, after the Cowboys extended tight end Jake Ferguson, Stephen Jones also talked about the willingness to get a deal done.\n\u201cWe want to pay Micah, too,\u201d Stephen said. \u201cHe\u2019s got to want to be paid, too.\u201d\nThat comment didn\u2019t sit well with Parsons. He even called Stephen Jones after it, a person familiar with the situation told The Dallas Morning News, to voice his displeasure. An apology was then made.\nOther Cowboys players have voiced their support for Parsons during these negotiations. Multiple Cowboys players changed their social media profile pictures to photos of Parsons. Trevon Diggs \u2014 in his own verbal bout with the Cowboys\u2019 front office \u2014 has been by Parsons\u2019 side on social media and in person. He posted \u201c7/11 4L\u201d after Parsons posted a GIF with the caption \u201cone last time.\u201d Prescott and Lamb have both talked about how tough it is to negotiate with their owners.\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s an every year conversation,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s myself, Zack Martin, CeeDee Lamb, now Micah Parsons. It\u2019s part of it in a sense. It\u2019s something that I wouldn\u2019t wish anyone was going through. Absolutely not.\u201d\nLamb also reacted on social media Friday.\n\u201cNever fails dawg,\u201d Lamb wrote. \u201cJust pay the man what you owe em. No need for the extra curricular.\u201d\nEven former Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant chimed in on social media. He thanked Parsons for doing something other former Cowboys stars didn\u2019t.\n\u201c... we failed tremendously on standing our ground due to a lack of knowledge,\u201d Bryant said in part.\nUp until Friday, the standstill was on par with past negotiations the Cowboys have had. Parsons had even shown up to training camp, which is something others hadn\u2019t done \u2014 even if he hadn\u2019t practiced yet \u2014 in a sign of goodwill toward the Cowboys and specifically to new head coach Brian Schottenheimer.\nWhere the sides go from here remains to be seen. Parsons could skip games, as Emmitt Smith once did. He could leave training camp now that a request has been made.\nJust because a request has been made doesn\u2019t mean the Cowboys will acquiesce, however.\nThe Cowboys have the ability to use the franchise tag on Parsons after this season. The projected franchise tag for defensive ends \u2014 which Parsons would be, based on his fifth-year option designation \u2014 is just over $26.5 million, according to Over The Cap. If the Cowboys tagged Parsons in consecutive years it would be at 120% of the previous season\u2019s salary. That would increase to a projected $31.8 million.\nBoth of those contracts would pale in comparison to the annual average value of some of the elite pass rushers. Pittsburgh Steelers defensive end T.J. Watt signed an extension recently that will pay him $41 million per year.\n\u201cWhen you go around the league and see these other teams taking care of their best guys \u2014 I see T.J. [Watt] got taken care of, Myles [Garrett] got taken care of, and he\u2019s got two years left on his deal,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cWhen you see a lot of people around the league getting taken care of you wish you had that same type of energy.\n\u201cI just say, \u2018Must be nice.\u2019\u201d\nNow, Parsons hopes another team could give him the same treatment.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been pretty consistent: If they don\u2019t want me here, then they don\u2019t want me here. I\u2019ll go about my business,\u201d he said earlier in training camp.\n\u201cLike I said, as long as I\u2019m here and under contract, I\u2019m going to do what I have to do to perform at the highest level. But if this is the end, this is the end.\u201d\nThat end seems at least possible now.\nFind more Cowboys coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.\nJoseph covers the Dallas Cowboys for The Dallas Morning News.
