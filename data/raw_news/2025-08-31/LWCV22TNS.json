  "title": "Trump says big cities are much more dangerous than the suburbs. Is that true in Northeast Ohio?",
  "description": "President Donald Trump is using crime rates as a reason to deploy federal troops to major, U.S. cities. What are crime rates for cities, townships and villages in Northeast Ohio?",
  "content": "How do Cleveland's crime rates compare to those of the suburbs? Cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer examined FBI data, given President Donald Trump's rationale for sending the military to cities. Rich Exner, cleveland.com\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio \u2013 President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to send troops to U.S. cities have rekindled the issues of crime and the disparities facing urban communities and their outlying neighbors.\n\nAnd while experts say crime has dropped in the past several years, fears of it have persisted.\n\nIn Cleveland, the gap in crime rates between the city and its suburbs remained wide last year, as the city leads the region in the rate of violent crime.\n\nThe disparity between Cleveland and the suburbs is most striking in cities like Middlefield in Geauga County, Mantua in Portage and Olmsted Falls in Cuyahoga, where police reported no violent crime last year.\n\nTo determine the differences between large cities and their suburbs in the region\u2019s eight counties, Cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer used FBI and census data to analyze the crime rates for 123 cities, villages and townships.\n\nThe analysis comes in the wake of Trump\u2019s takeover of Washington, D.C., by the National Guard and his deployment of troops to Los Angeles earlier this year. In recent weeks, the president has threatened to deploy soldiers to other U.S. cities such as Chicago, Baltimore, San Francisco and New York, arguing crime rates necessitate such action.\n\nThe data and crime experts provide a more nuanced view of crime than the president\u2019s narrative suggests, that crime is out of control.\n\nCleveland city officials often note their crime rates are down since the pandemic, a figure that is reflected in data from both the FBI and the office of the Cuyahoga County medical examiner. That mirrors national trends.\n\n\u201cPublic safety has been and always will be our No. 1 priority,\u201d Cleveland spokesman Tyler Sinclair said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to aggressively combat crime wherever it happens and whenever it happens, and will work to apprehend whoever is responsible.\u201d\n\nCleveland\u2019s violent crime rate was followed by East Cleveland and then Akron, data shows.\n\nRates of property crimes were perhaps more unexpected. For example, the suburb of Brooklyn reported a higher property crime rate than Cleveland last year. Springfield Township, a Summit County suburb, had a higher property crime rate than Akron last year.\n\nSmall numbers tend to skew percentages, and that\u2019s true with crime data as well. Cuyahoga Heights, a town of 556 people, reported four violent crimes in 2024, giving it \u2013 at least on paper \u2013 a violent crime rate that\u2019s higher than Lorain, Garfield Heights or Elyria.\n\nExperts also caution against apples-to-oranges comparisons between towns. For example, most suburbs in Northeast Ohio don\u2019t have as many retail stores as Beachwood and Strongsville, meaning there are simply fewer opportunities to steal at many other communities.\n\nNot only do crime rates differ between the city and the suburbs, residents in the two areas also have a different relationship with law enforcement, said Lew Katz, a former chairman of the Cleveland Community Police Commission.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to get police to react the same to everyone,\u201d said Katz, who is a professor emeritus of law at Case Western Reserve University. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t exist, and that\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d\n\nCrime rates for communities are useful, albeit imperfect data, said Daniel Flannery, the director of the Begun Center for Violence Prevention Research and Education at Case Western Reserve University.\n\nOne of the key reasons why crime data can be flawed is that reporting is optional, and there are many discrepancies between how one department reports its crime rates compared to another.\n\nMany small departments don\u2019t report their crime rates to the FBI. In cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer\u2019s analysis of local crime rates, the newspaper identified 67 local governments that did not report crime rates.\n\nFor many of those, no figures exist because they were small enough to contract with a county sheriff or an adjacent town for their policing services.\n\nSome mid-size suburbs, such as Shaker Heights and Middleburg Heights, also did not submit 2024 crime data to the FBI.\n\nCrime rates are falling, generally, across the country, particularly after a post-COVID-19 spike in crime across the board.\n\nA July report from the Council on Criminal Justice looked at data for 30 U.S. cities and found homicides were down 17% compared to last year. Aggravated assaults, gun assaults, sexual assaults and robberies were also down, the report said.\n\nHowever, many people feel unsafe in their neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cYou may not feel as safe walking around Shaker Square because the lighting needs to be improved,\u201d Flannery said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a violent neighborhood.\u201d\n\nDespite the flaws in crime data, Katz thinks they are largely telling the correct story: that crime is down overall. But personal experiences are far more likely to affect someone\u2019s perception of safety than statistics.\n\n\u201cI think the statistics are accurate,\u201d Katz said. \u201c(But) if you\u2019re a victim, crime isn\u2019t down.\u201d\n\nOne program Katz thought was particularly successful in reducing crime was \u201cHoops After Dark,\u201d which provides positive activities for people in neighborhoods disproportionately affected by crime.\n\n\u201cWe need to be doing more about providing activities to kids and young adults to do in their free time,\u201d Katz said.\n\nWith some of these programs in the crosshairs of federal budget cuts, Flannery worries much of that progress could be undone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a long-term effective strategy, in my view, to just send in the military to an entire city every time the perception is \u2013 or the rhetoric is \u2013 that this is a violent community that\u2019s completely out of control,\" Flannery said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a sustainable model.\u201d\n\nFor cities, townships and villages in Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage and Summit counties that reported crimes to the FBI in 2024, here is how their crime rates compared to their populations.\n\nViolent crime includes homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Property crime includes arson, burglary, theft and motor vehicle theft, according to the FBI\u2019s website.",

      "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio \u2013 As Cleveland enters its most deadly months of the year, at least two local violence prevention groups are reducing services because of federal budget cuts.\nLeaders from the Brenda Glass Trauma Recovery Center and Cleveland Peacemakers Alliance told cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer they have already cut staff or services after President Donald Trump\u2019s administration canceled $1.7 million in remaining grant funding.\nThough the cuts were announced in April, the nonprofits are seeing the effects play out now, as gun violence begins its seasonal increase and the groups\u2019 services are most needed.\nThat was highlighted earlier this week, when suspects fired 80 gunshots at a block party during an East Side shootout that left one dead and five injured.\nThat attack followed one earlier this month, when seven people were injured in a mass shooting in Cleveland\u2019s Lee-Harvard neighborhood.\n\u201cWe\u2019re praying we\u2019re able to find some funds for June because we don\u2019t want to stop helping people who aren\u2019t safe,\u201d said Brenda Glass, the center\u2019s founder and CEO.\nAs a result, Glass has cut three staff members and may have to close some of the 12 safe houses meant for witnesses or victims of violent crime, she said. In 2023, the nonprofit had eight staff members.\nThe Peacemakers Alliance, perhaps best known for fighting youth violence and working in hospitals to prevent retaliatory shootings, has cut wraparound services such as helping crime victims with utility support, funeral expenses, housing, recouping lost wages and food, said Myesha Watkins, the executive director.\n\u201cIt puts us in a position where we can only offer thoughts and prayers,\u201d Watkins said of the budget cuts.\nFor now, the group can afford to pay outreach workers in hospitals, Watkins said. To do so, the nonprofit is pulling from its general fund, which it cannot do indefinitely, she said.\nThe Peacemakers Alliance gained the $2 million grant through the U.S. Justice Department. It then distributed $832,000 to Glass for the trauma center and $350,000 to Cleveland State University for research.\nThe trauma center had already spent $310,592 from the grant and Cleveland State had spent roughly $70,000, officials from those groups said.\nThe rest was supposed to last until September 2026. The financial loss is a substantial hit to the agencies, and it appears to be their largest source of funding. In the most recent available tax documents, the agencies each brought in less than $600,000 in 2023.\nFor the trauma center, the laid-off staff include a part-time therapist, a part-time housing coordinator and a full-time case manager, said Glass, who took a 50% pay cut in addition to the layoffs.\nMost recently, the Peacemakers Alliance secured a $75,000 grant, a third of which will go to the Brenda Glass center, from the national nonprofit Community Based Public Safety Collective.\nWhile some local organizations like the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Cleveland Foundation have been generous with their support, Watkins said, \u201cThere\u2019s no organization investing the amount that was lost.\u201d\nThese programs do more than just comfort the victims of crime.\nSince the trauma center also helps willing witnesses testify by giving them safe housing and transportation to court, the program \u201cnot only cleans up the streets but helps people willing to testify get the safety they need, which they\u2019re not going to get from the justice system,\u201d Glass said.\nOne of the program\u2019s current clients, who asked cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer not to publish his name because of his fear of reprisals, said the Brenda Glass Trauma Recovery Center has been key to getting him to leave a dangerous situation.\nAfter spending a week in the hospital for a gunshot wound, the trauma center moved him into a hotel for a week with his girlfriend before they ended up in a safe house, he said.\nFrom there, the center helped him with big things like transportation and therapy, but it also little things like kitchenware and groceries, he said.\n\u201cThe little things for sure added up because I needed (them),\u201d he said.\nFor him, the trauma recovery center represented \u201ca better opportunity\u201d than where he was living. And unlike some shelter programs, he was able to enter the program with his girlfriend, as a unit.\n\u201cThey seemed like a safe environment to go to,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say they\u2019ll do something, and they do it. So, I just trusted them.\u201d\nEven when they leave the safety of the agency, the trauma center\u2019s clients often take that opportunity to improve their lives, she said.\n\u201cNinety-five percent of the people we serve decide they want to do something better,\u201d Glass said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to stay in these neighborhoods where violence is happening daily.\u201d\nGlass\u2019 program has helped 163 people since last July. The grant cancellation blocked $280,000 from funding research on the program\u2019s effectiveness through Cleveland State University.\nRachel Lovell, an assistant professor of criminology who was working on the research, said the canceled funding will have a \u201cprofound\u201d effect on Cleveland\u2019s gun violence victims.\n\u201cThe trauma that people experience either firsthand or secondhand from gun violence lasts generations,\u201d Lovell said.\n\u201cBeing able to address that when it happens is extremely important to be able for communities to heal and for victims and their families to heal.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "Cleveland\u2019s violent crime rate remains markedly higher than that of its suburbs, a gap highlighted by FBI and census data used by Cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer amid President Trump\u2019s rhetoric about deploying troops to cities.  While overall U.S. crime has fallen\u2014homicides down 17% last year\u2014Cleveland officials note a post\u2011pandemic decline that is still eclipsed by suburban rates.  Local violence\u2011prevention groups, such as the Brenda Glass Trauma Recovery Center and Cleveland Peacemakers Alliance, have cut staff and services after the Trump administration cancelled $1.7\u202fmillion in federal grant funding, jeopardizing programs that support victims and witnesses.  The article underscores the tension between national policy narratives and the nuanced, data\u2011driven reality of crime trends in the region.",
