  "title": "3 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks to Buy Right Now",
  "description": "Investors will get great dividends and more with these stocks.",
  "content": "Investors will get great dividends and more with these stocks.\n\nHow does getting paid to own a stock sound to you? That's exactly what dividends do. Even if you don't need extra income, reinvesting dividends can significantly increase the total returns you achieve over the long run.\n\nThree Motley Fool contributors think they've found unstoppable dividend stocks to buy right now. Here's why they picked Abbott Laboratories (ABT 0.45%), AbbVie (ABBV 0.38%), and Pfizer (PFE 0.33%).\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny (Abbott Laboratories): Despite the threat from tariffs that could affect its financial results, Abbott Laboratories, a medical device specialist, has performed well this year. While we can't guarantee it will maintain that momentum through the end of 2025, the healthcare giant has plenty of qualities that make it a top stock to own, particularly for income-seeking investors.\n\nAbbott Laboratories has a diversified business across four main therapeutic segments: medical devices, established pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, and nutrition. The company also has a significant presence across much of the world. The company's diversified business allows it to weather the storm when one of its segments isn't performing well.\n\nAnd it has several important long-term opportunities. The most lucrative might be its FreeStyle Libre, a series of continuous glucose monitoring systems that enable people with diabetes to track their blood glucose levels. It has been Abbott's key growth driver for some time, but there is still significant white space in this market. Beyond that, the company routinely innovates and earns clearances for newer devices.\n\nSome of the other units within the medical devices sector, including structural heart and heart failure, have also performed well.\n\nLastly, Abbott Laboratories has a remarkable streak of 53 consecutive years of dividend increases, earning it the title of Dividend King. No company can achieve a feat of this caliber without having a rock-solid underlying business -- and that's exactly what dividend investors should focus on, rather than passing on the stock because of its unimpressive 1.8% forward dividend yield (the S&P 500's average is 1.3%).\n\nInvestors shouldn't buy Abbott Laboratories' shares because of its strong performance this year. The company's excellent prospects and impressive dividend program are much better reasons.\n\nDavid Jagielski (AbbVie): Drugmaker AbbVie is a terrific blue chip dividend stock that looks poised not only for higher future payouts, but also for tremendous growth. The company has a robust portfolio of assets that can help grow its business in the long run and pave the way for significant dividend increases along the way.\n\nAbbVie, which is already a Dividend King when you count the time that it was part of Abbott Laboratories, has been raising its payouts at generous rates in the past few years. Since 2020, when its quarterly dividend was $1.18 per share, the healthcare company has boosted its payout by 39%, to $1.64 today. That averages to a compound annual growth rate of 6.8% -- well above the usual rate of inflation.\n\nIts payout ratio is over 100%, and that could make its dividend look risky. But in reality, there's plenty of room for AbbVie to still boost its dividend even higher. Its free cash flow over the trailing 12 months has totaled $18.2 billion, which is far higher than how much it has paid in dividends over that stretch ($11.3 billion).\n\nThrough the first six months of the year, the company's net revenue has risen organically by 8%, to $28.8 billion. And what's impressive is that it's doing that even as it isn't firing on all cylinders. While its immunology and neuroscience segments grew by double digits over the past two quarters, oncology revenue has grown organically by only 5%. And aesthetics, which includes its Botox cosmetic business, has declined by 9%.\n\nThere are still many opportunities for AbbVie to increase its top and bottom lines in the future, which is why this is an exciting stock to own. It already offers a great above-average yield of 3.2%, which is more than double the S&P 500 average. For income investors, this is an unstoppable-looking stock to hang on to for the long haul.\n\nAn ultra-high yield you shouldn't have to worry about\n\nKeith Speights (Pfizer): When investors see an ultra-high dividend yield of over 5%, they might be tempted to worry about its sustainability. However, Pfizer's forward dividend yield of roughly 6.7% should be quite safe.\n\nThe big drugmaker isn't a member of dividend royalty like Abbott and AbbVie. But Pfizer has increased its dividend for 16 consecutive years and has paid a dividend for an impressive 347 quarters in a row.\n\nCould those streaks be in jeopardy because of Pfizer's looming patent cliff? I don't think so. Sure, the company faces losses of exclusivity (LOEs) over the next three years for several top drugs, including blood thinner Eliquis, breast cancer drug Ibrance, and autoimmune disease drug Xeljanz. But these LOEs are only one side of the story.\n\nPfizer also has multiple products in its lineup that should be key growth drivers for years to come. Eczema drug Cibinqo, multiple myeloma drug Elrexfio, and bladder cancer drug Padcev especially stand out.\n\nThe company's pipeline is also promising, with 108 programs in clinical development. Experimental lung cancer drug sigvotatug vedotin and breast cancer candidate atirmociclib could especially be big winners in the future.\n\nIn addition to a juicy dividend, Pfizer offers investors an attractive valuation. The stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio is a super-low 8.3.",

      "text": "With a global medical device market size of almost $680 billion, it's not surprising that many investors are interested in medical device stocks. And with that market expected to grow to more than $1.1 trillion by 2034, investor interest will almost certainly intensify.\nIn this article, we'll address exactly what medical device stocks are and identify some of the best stocks to buy. We'll also identify some of the top medical device exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nWhat are they?\nWhat are medical device stocks?\nMedical device stocks are shares of companies that make and sell medical devices. Medical devices include any appliance, instrument, or machine used to diagnose, treat, or prevent a disease or condition. Software, implants, and chemical reagents used for those purposes are also considered medical devices.\nIf you think that's a broadly defined category, you're right. The World Health Organization estimates that there are roughly 2 million different kinds of medical devices marketed today.\nThe best stocks\nThe best medical device stocks in 2025\nThere are many great medical device stocks for investors to consider. Five of the best picks right now are Abbott Laboratories (ABT 0.45%), GE Healthcare (GEHC 2.74%), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 1.22%), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 0.08%), and Transmedics Group (TMDX 0.67%).\n| Name and ticker | Market cap | Dividend yield | Industry |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) | $231 billion | 1.75% | Healthcare Equipment and Supplies |\n| GE HealthCare Technologies (NASDAQ:GEHC) | $34 billion | 0.18% | Healthcare Equipment and Supplies |\n| Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) | $171 billion | 0.00% | Healthcare Equipment and Supplies |\n| Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) | $432 billion | 2.80% | Pharmaceuticals |\n| TransMedics Group (NASDAQ:TMDX) | $4 billion | 0.00% | Healthcare Equipment and Supplies |\n1 - 2\n1. Abbott Laboratories\nAbbott Laboratories is a large-cap company that makes medical devices, including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, defibrillators, heart failure monitoring systems, mechanical heart valves, pacemakers, and spinal cord stimulators. It also operates multibillion-dollar business segments that market established pharmaceuticals, diagnostics systems, and nutritional products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic provided a huge boost to Abbott's fortunes, thanks to the company's rapid diagnostic tests. Although the company's overall revenue declined as demand for the tests waned, Abbott's base business remains strong.\nIn particular, Abbott's FreeStyle Libre stands out as a key growth driver. It's the top-selling CGM device in the world, with soaring sales.\nIncome investors may find Abbott especially attractive. It's a Dividend King with 53 consecutive years of dividend increases.\n2. GE Healthcare Technologies\nGE Healthcare Technologies was spun off from General Electric (GE -0.71%) in 2023. However, the large-cap company has been a leader in the medical device market for decades.\nThe company has four business segments: imaging, advanced visualization solutions, patient care solutions, and pharmaceutical diagnostics. Medical imaging ranks by far as its biggest moneymaker, generating more than 40% of total revenue.\nLike many medical device stocks, GE Healthcare should benefit from aging populations across the world. This tailwind could drive higher demand for the company's products as older individuals require more healthcare services.\nGE Healthcare appears to be in a strong position to capitalize on this opportunity. It has a great track record of innovation and also invests heavily in research and development -- more than $1 billion each year.\n3 - 5\n3. Intuitive Surgical\nIntuitive Surgical is a large-cap company that pioneered the development of minimally invasive robotic surgical systems. The company launched its flagship da Vinci surgical system in 1999. Da Vinci was first approved for use in general laparoscopic surgery, but today it is used in a wide range of procedures.\nMore than 17.6 million procedures have been performed using da Vinci systems, with almost 2.7 million of those procedures done in 2024. More than 11,000 da Vinci systems are installed in hospitals across the world.\nAside from a temporary slowdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, Intuitive Surgical's procedure volumes have grown steadily in recent years, boosting the company's recurring revenue from selling replacement instruments. In 2024, recurring revenue made up 84% of Intuitive's total revenue.\nAging trends should help Intuitive Surgical by driving increased demand for surgical procedures. The company also continues to enhance its robotic surgical systems so that they can be used for additional types of procedures.\n4. Johnson & Johnson\nJohnson & Johnson is a large-cap company that ranks as one of the biggest medical device makers in the world. It markets medical devices that include catheters, implants, robotic surgical systems, surgical instruments, and wound closure products. J&J also is a top maker of prescription drugs.\nAcquisitions have played a big role in helping Johnson & Johnson grow its medical device business. In recent years, the healthcare giant has acquired several medtech companies, including Abiomed and Verb Surgical.\nJohnson & Johnson spun off its consumer health unit into a separate publicly traded entity, Kenvue (KVUE 0.72%), in May 2023. The move should enable the company to deliver even stronger growth.\nThe stock remains a favorite for income investors, too. J&J has increased its dividend for an impressive 63 consecutive years, making it one of the top Dividend Kings in the market.\n5. TransMedics Group\nTransMedics Group is a small-cap company that markets devices that support transporting donor organs. Its Organ Care System (OCS) essentially keeps lungs, hearts, and livers functioning during transportation.\nOCS presents a huge leap forward from the cold storage that's the current standard for transporting donor organs. The technology significantly increases the number of organs that are able to ultimately be used in transplants. It also can help greatly reduce post-transplantation complications.\nThis big unmet medical need provides a great opportunity for TransMedics. The company's national aviation fleet, the first dedicated exclusively to transporting donor organs, puts it in a strong position to take advantage of this opportunity.\nTransMedics continues to deliver strong revenue growth. The company is also now profitable, with rapidly increasing earnings.\nMedical device ETFs\nMedical device ETFs\nFor investors who want to buy a basket of medical device stocks, there are several medical device ETFs to consider, including iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI 1.55%), SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment ETF (XHE 3.3%), and First Trust Indxx Medical Devices ETF (MDEV 2.2%).\n1. iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF\nThe iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF is operated by BlackRock (BLK 2.08%). This ETF invests only in U.S. medical device companies. The fund\u2019s annual expense ratio is 0.4%.\nIHI currently owns positions in 47 stocks. Its top holdings include Abbott Laboratories, Intuitive Surgical, Boston Scientific (BSX 0.74%), Edwards Lifesciences (EW 0.73%), and Stryker (SYK 2.44%).\n2. SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment ETF\nThe SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment ETF is operated by State Street (STT 2.78%). It invests in healthcare equipment and healthcare supplies companies, a group that includes many medical device companies. The ETF\u2019s annual expense ratio is 0.35%.\nXHE currently owns positions in 64 stocks. Its top holdings include Align Technology (ALGN 6.33%), Haemonetics, Envista Holdings (NVST 6.16%), Glaukos (GKOS 4.86%), and The Cooper Companies (COO 2.98%).\n3. First Trust Indxx Medical Devices ETF\nThe First Trust Indxx Medical Devices ETF is operated by First Trust Portfolios. This ETF invests in medical device companies based in both the U.S. and other countries. Its annual expense ratio is 0.70%.\nMDEV currently owns positions in 50 stocks. Its top holdings include Wuxi AppTech (WUXI.F 0.28%), Sartorius (SUVP.F 9.83%), Hoya (OTC:HOCP.Y), Align Technology, and Cochlear Limited (CHEO.Y 0.91%).\nRelated investing topics\nShould you invest?\nShould you invest in medical device companies?\nAs is the case with most investing questions, the best answer about whether you should invest in medical device companies is: It depends. Every investor has different goals, risk tolerances, and time horizons.\nOne key risk associated with medical device stocks is that they can decline during economic downturns as healthcare providers reduce their spending. They also face volatility related to government and private payer reimbursement decisions.\nMedical device companies can experience significant setbacks when products in development have problems during clinical trials or fail to win regulatory approvals. Even products that successfully reach the market can face intense competition. It's also possible that the products might cause harm to patients, potentially resulting in litigation that affects the companies' business.\nInvestors with short time horizons and/or low risk tolerance levels should especially take these factors into consideration.\nHowever, the long-term prospects for the medical device industry generally appear to be very good. Aging demographics and technological innovations should provide nice tailwinds for the medical device sector.\nMedical device stocks are often recession-resistant when their products are must-haves for patient care. And while competition can sometimes be intense, regulatory hurdles and high research and development investment costs can create barriers to entry for new competitors.\nFor long-term investors who don't mind the potential for volatility, medical device stocks should provide an attractive opportunity.\nFAQ\nMedical device stocks FAQ\nWhat are the medical device stocks with the highest dividends?\nAre medical device stocks a good buy now?\nSome medical device stocks are good choices to buy now. Consider individual medical device stocks' valuations, growth prospects, and market positioning before buying.\nWhat are the top medical device companies?\nThe top medical device companies based on market cap include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), and Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG).\nWhat are the most undervalued medical device stocks?\nSome of the most undervalued medical device stocks based on forward price-to-earnings ratios include Integra LifeSciences Holdings (NASDAQ:IART), AdaptHealth (NASDAQ:AHCO), and InMode (NASDAQ:INMD).\nHow big is the medical devices market in 2025?\nThe global medical device market was around $679 billion in 2025, according to Precedence Research."

      "text": "Free cash flow (FCF) is the cash that remains after a company pays to support its operations and makes any capital expenditures (purchases of physical assets such as property and equipment). Free cash flow is related to, but not the same as, net income. Net income is commonly used to measure a company's profitability, while free cash flow provides better insight into both a company's business model and the organization's financial health.\nWhat is free cash flow?\nWhat is free cash flow?\nFree cash flow is calculated using several items from a company's cash flow statement. To determine FCF, subtract \"capital expenditures\" from \"net cash from operating activities\" (sometimes listed as \"cash provided by operations\" or a similar term). The formula looks like this:\nFree cash flow = Net cash from operating activities - Capital expenditures\nIf a company (such as many high-growth technology companies) has \"capitalized software expenses\" or regularly reports \"business acquisitions\" on its cash flow statements, then these cash outlays are also subtracted from \"net cash from operating activities\" to calculate FCF.\nTo find these items in a company's quarterly or annual filing, look for the cash flow statement. This table is divided into three sections: Operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. \"Net cash from operating activities\" (or something similar) can be found under the operating activities section, while \"capital expenditures\" and other qualifying expenses are listed under investing activities.\nHow to calculate FCF\nHow to calculate FCF\nHere are two real-world FCF examples from two different companies, Chevron and Nike.\nFirst, from Chevron's statement of cash flows from its 2022 annual report.\n(Net cash provided by operating activities of $49.6 billion) - (Capital expenditures of $12 billion) = Free cash flow of $37.6 billion\nAnd from Nike's 2022 annual report filing under the consolidated statement of cash flows:\n(Cash provided by operations of $5.2 billion) - (Additions to property, plant, and equipment of $758 million) = Free cash flow of $4.4 billion.\nAs you can see, FCF is calculated for all types of companies. A company that requires heavy investment in property and equipment like Chevron can produce meaningful free cash flow. So can companies with lots of non-physical assets like branding and e-commerce sites such as Nike.\nWhatever the company does for business, FCF is a simple measure of leftover cash at the end of a stated period of time. This remaining cash is available to the company for paying off debt, paying dividends to shareholders, or funding stock repurchase programs. (Such transactions are recorded in the \"financing activities\" section of the cash flow statement).\nThe free cash flow figure can also be used in a discounted cash flow model to estimate the future value of a company.\nCash Flow\nHow FCF differs from net income and EBITDA\nHow FCF differs from net income and EBITDA\nFree cash flow is different from a company's net earnings or net loss, which are used to calculate the popular earnings per share (EPS) and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios.\nFCF excludes non-cash items like depreciation and amortization (assessed for only tax purposes to account for the values of assets paid for in the past), changes in inventory values, and stock-based employee compensation. Because FCF only encompasses cash transactions, it gives a clearer picture of just how profitable a company is.\nFCF can also reveal whether a company is manipulating its earnings -- such as via the sale of assets (a non-operating line item) or by adjusting the value of its inventory of products for sale. Or, if a company made a large purchase (like buying a new property or investing in new intangible assets) in the recent past, then free cash flow could be higher than net income -- or still positive even when a company reports a net loss.\nFCF is also different from earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Unlike FCF, EBITDA excludes both interest payments on debt and tax payments. Like FCF, EBITDA can help to reveal a company's true cash-generating potential and can be useful to compare one firm's profit potential to its peers.\nAsset\nFCF is important -- but still has limitations\nFCF is important -- but still has limitations\nFCF, as compared with net income, gives a more accurate picture of a firm's financial health and is more difficult to manipulate, but it isn't perfect. Because it measures cash remaining at the end of a stated period, it can be a much \"lumpier\" metric than net income.\nFor example, if a company purchases new property, FCF could be negative while net income remains positive. Likewise, FCF can remain positive while net income is far less or even negative. If a company receives a large one-time payment for services rendered, its FCF very likely may remain positive even if it incurs high amortization expenses (like the costs of software and other intangible assets for a cloud computing company).\nBecause of the short-term variability inherent in FCF, many investors opt to evaluate the health of a company using net income since it smooths out the peaks and valleys in profitability. However, when evaluated over long periods of time, FCF provides a better picture of a company's actual operational results. FCF is also useful for measuring a company's ability to pay down debt and fund dividend payments.\nNegative FCF reported for an extended period of time could be a red flag for investors. Negative FCF drains cash and assets from a company's balance sheet, and, when a company is low on funds, it may need to cut or eliminate its dividend or raise more cash via the sale of new debt or stock.\nRelated investing topics\nUse FCF as part of your stock selection process\nUse FCF as part of your stock selection process\nFree cash flow has its limitations, but it can also be a powerful tool. Consider it along with other metrics such as sales growth and the cash flow-to-debt ratio to fully assess whether a stock is worthy of your hard-earned money."

      "text": "Patent protection is necessary for a functioning market economy. Businesses need to have assurance that they will be able to reap benefits from successful invention and innovation and the investments they require.\nHowever, patents eventually expire. They last for 20 years in the U.S. from the date the patent is filed. When that time period ends, businesses face something known as a patent cliff.\nWhat is a patent cliff?\nWhat is a patent cliff?\nA patent cliff is a term given to the end of a profit stream once the patent expires. The concept generally applies to the pharmaceutical industry since drug companies make most of their money from patented products that eventually become generic drugs once the patent expires.\nThe \"cliff\" in the patent cliff signifies the revenue or profit falling sharply once the patent expires.\nWhy the patent cliff is important\nWhy the patent cliff is important\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, a blockbuster drug can make or break a stock, and with some biotech companies, one drug could represent a majority of a company's revenue or profits.\nIf you're analyzing a stock like this, it's important to be aware of the company's patents, as an approaching patent cliff can make a stock look cheap -- even though it's cheap for a reason since its profits will soon fall sharply.\nIf you're analyzing a pharmaceutical company, you'll want to take note of patent expirations and the drug pipeline to see if the company is developing any drugs that could help it recoup some of the money lost when it goes over the patent cliff.\nInvestors may discuss the effects of the patent cliff on specific pharmaceutical companies or on the industry more broadly since it's a perennial source of concern and the reason why drugmakers need to constantly spend on research and development and refresh their product portfolio.\nWhat happens afterward\nWhat happens when a drug goes over the patent cliff\nThe patent cliff has a wide range of effects on different stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry.\nFor the drugmaker, it's clearly a negative. That company is losing a reliable cash flow from the drug it invented. Without exclusivity to produce the drug, the drugmaker can't sell it at a premium.\nHowever, other stakeholders benefit when the drug goes over a patent cliff. Among those are generic drugmakers like Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA -1.78%), which are now able to sell the drug at a lower price than it had been when it was exclusive and branded.\nSales of the drug sometimes fall once the drug goes generic because the company that invented it tends to stop promoting it. According to one estimate, a brand-name drug will lose half of its sales within two years of the patent expiration.\nHowever, higher-profile drugs are likely to represent a windfall for generic drugmakers, especially if they were expensive as branded medicines.\nAdditionally, consumers clearly benefit from drugs going off-patent since they can get the drugs they need at a lower price. According to one report from the National Bureau of Economic Research, prices for physician-administered drugs fell 38% to 48% and 25% for oral drugs. Meanwhile, total revenue actually increased 57% for physician-administered drugs and 46% for oral drugs, showing that sales of the drugs increased substantially due to the lower price in that study.\nRelated investing topics\nWhat's an example of a patent cliff?\nWhat's an example of a patent cliff?\nEvery year, drug companies face the patent cliff. This year, one of the biggest patent cliffs is Abbvie's (ABBV 0.38%) Humira, its blockbuster anti-inflammatory drug that costs $50,000 a year, making Humira the most profitable drug in pharmaceutical history.\nAbbvie had gamed the patent system since 2016 -- when the patent was originally set to expire -- to generate another $114 billion in revenue from Humira. But the patent cliff will cost Abbvie about $20 billion this year, and the company is leaning on newer drugs like Skyrizi and Rinvoq to replace the lost revenue from Humira, a familiar strategy.\nWhatever happens with Humira and the patent cliff, the system is unlikely to change, and pharmaceutical and biotech investors will have to continue to take the patent cliff into account.\nWhether you're in a bull market or a bear market, the patent cliff is still going to apply, and it's going to affect the pharma industry. Investors in drugmakers will have to do their research to make sure they're not buying just before a big drug goes off-patent."

      "text": "Dividend investing can be a great investment strategy. Dividend stocks have historically outperformed the S&P 500 with less volatility. That's because dividend stocks provide two sources of return: regular income from dividend payments and capital appreciation of the stock price. This total return can add up over time.\nDividends Per Share\nBecause of their lower volatility, dividend stocks often appeal to investors looking for lower-risk investments, especially those in or nearing retirement. But dividend stocks can still be risky if you don't know what to avoid. Here's a closer look at how to invest in dividend stocks.\nHow they work\nHow dividend stocks work\nLet's look at an example. Say you buy 100 shares of a company for $10 each, and each share pays a dividend of $0.50 annually. If you invested $1,000, you would receive $50 in dividend payments over the course of a year. That works out to a 5% dividend yield -- not too shabby. What you choose to do with your dividends is up to you. You can:\n- Automatically reinvest them to buy more shares of the company through a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP).\n- Buy stock in a different company.\n- Save the cash.\n- Spend the money.\nWhether the company's stock price goes up or down, you will receive those dividend payments as long as the company continues to disburse them. The beauty of stocks that pay dividends is that part of your return includes predictable quarterly payments.\nNot every company offering dividend stocks can maintain a dividend payout in every economic environment, but a diversified portfolio of dividend stocks can produce reliable income, rain or shine. Combine those dividends with capital appreciation as the companies you own grow in value, and the total returns can rival and even exceed those of the broader market.\nExamples\nExamples of dividend stocks\nHere are some well-known companies with a long history of paying dividends, along with their dividend yields at recent stock prices and the per-share amount of each dividend:\n| Company | Industry | Dividend Yield | Quarterly Dividend Amount |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Chevron (NYSE:CVX) | Energy | 4.11% | $1.71 |\n| Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) | Consumer defensive | 2.47% | $1.006 |\n| Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) | Consumer cyclical | 1.95% | $1.15 |\nBoth Procter & Gamble and Lowe's have increased their stock dividends for more than 50 consecutive years, placing them in an elite group of companies known as the Dividend Kings. They're also part of the Dividend Achievers, a trademarked property owned by Nasdaq. Dividend Achievers are S&P 500 index companies with more than 10 years of consecutive dividend increases.\nChevron has a 38-year streak of dividend growth. Dividend stocks can come from just about any industry, and the amount of the dividend and percentage yield can vary greatly from one company to the next.\nKey metrics\nDividend yield and other key metrics\nBefore you buy any dividend stocks, it's important to know how to evaluate them. These metrics can help you understand how much in dividends to expect, how reliable a dividend might be, and -- most importantly -- how to identify red flags.\nDividend yield\nThe dividend yield is the annualized dividend represented as a percentage of the stock price. For instance, if a company pays $1 in annualized dividends and the stock costs $20 per share, the dividend yield would be 5%.\nYield is useful as a valuation metric when you compare a stock's current yield to its historical levels. A higher dividend yield is better, all other things being equal, but a company's ability to maintain the dividend payout -- and, ideally, increase it -- matters even more. An abnormally high dividend yield could be a red flag.\nDividend payout ratio\nThis is the dividend as a percentage of a company's earnings. If a company earns $1 per share in net income and pays a $0.50-per-share dividend, the dividend payout ratio is 50%. In general terms, the lower the payout ratio, the more sustainable a dividend is.\nCash dividend payout ratio\nThis is the dividend as a percentage of a company's operating cash flows minus capital expenditures, or free cash flow (FCF). This metric is relevant because GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income is not a cash measure.\nVarious noncash expenses can cause a company's earnings and FCF to vary significantly from one period to the next. This variability can cause a company's payout ratio to be misleading at times. Investors can use the cash dividend payout ratio, along with the simple payout ratio, to better understand a dividend's sustainability.\nTotal return\nThis is the increase in stock price (known as capital gains) plus dividends paid. For example, if you pay $10 for a stock that increases in value by $1 and pays a $0.50 dividend, then that $1.50 you've gained is equivalent to a 15% total return.\nEarnings per share (EPS)\nThe EPS metric normalizes a company's earnings to the per-share value. The best dividend stocks are companies that have shown that they can regularly increase earnings per share over time and thus raise their dividend. A history of earnings growth is often evidence of durable competitive advantages.\nPrice-to-earnings (P/E) ratio\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its earnings per share. This metric, along with dividend yield, can be used to determine whether a dividend stock is fairly valued.\nHigh yield\nHigh yield isn't everything\nInexperienced dividend investors often make the mistake of buying stocks with the highest dividend yields. While high-yield stocks aren't bad, high yields can be the result of a stock's price falling due to the risk of the dividend being cut. That's called a dividend yield trap. Here are some steps you can take to avoid falling for a yield trap:\n- Avoid buying stocks based solely on dividend yield. If a company has a significantly higher yield than its peers, that's often a sign of trouble, not opportunity.\n- Use the payout ratios to gauge a dividend's sustainability.\n- Use a company's dividend history of payout growth and yield as a guide.\n- Study the balance sheet, including debt, cash, and other assets and liabilities.\n- Consider the company and industry. Is the company's business at risk from competitors, weak demand, or some other disruption?\nSadly, a yield that looks too good to be true often is. It's better to buy a dividend stock with a rock-solid lower yield than to chase a high yield that may prove illusory. Moreover, focusing on dividend growth -- a company's history and ability to raise its stock dividend -- often proves more profitable.\nTaxes\nHow are dividends taxed?\nMost dividend stocks pay qualified dividends, which are taxed at a 0%, 15%, or 20% rate, depending on your tax bracket. The range is significantly lower than the ordinary income tax rates of 10% to 37% or more. (An additional 3.8% tax is levied on certain investment income for the highest earners.)\nMost dividends qualify for the lower tax rates. However, some are classified as \"ordinary\" or nonqualified dividends and are taxed at your marginal tax rate.\nSeveral kinds of stocks are structured to pay high dividend yields and may come with higher tax obligations because of their corporate structures. The two most common are real estate investment trusts (REITs) and master limited partnerships (MLPs).\nOf course, this extra tax burden doesn't apply if your dividend stocks are held in a tax-advantaged retirement plan such as an individual retirement account (IRA). However, investing in MLPs can sometimes leave you owing taxes, even on your IRA.\nStrategies\nDividend investment strategies\nThere's a misconception that dividend stocks are only for retirees or risk-averse investors. That's not the case. When you start investing, you should consider buying dividend-paying stocks to reap their long-term benefits.\nDividend stocks, especially those in companies that consistently increase their dividends, have historically outperformed the market with less volatility -- expressed in a measure called beta. Because of that, dividend stocks are a great fit for almost every investor. They can help you create a diversified, wealth-building portfolio.\nBeta\nThere are a few dividend strategies to consider. The first is to build a dividend portfolio as part of your overall portfolio. When building a dividend portfolio, it's important to remember that paying dividends isn't obligatory for a company in the same way that companies must make interest payments on bonds. So, if a company has to cut expenses, the dividend could be at risk.\nYou can't completely eliminate the risk of a dividend cut, but you can lower the risk. Focus less on a company's dividend yield and more on its ability to increase its dividend consistently. Look for a company with a sound financial profile focused on a growing industry.\nRelated investing topics\nAnother aspect of a dividend investing strategy is determining how you want to reinvest your dividends. Some investors opt to reinvest their dividends manually, while others use a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP).\nThis powerful tool will take every dividend you earn and automatically reinvest it -- without fees or commissions -- into shares of that company. This simple set-it-and-forget-it tool is one of the easiest ways to use the power of time and compounding value to your advantage.\nAnother dividend investing strategy is to invest in a dividend-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) or mutual fund. These fund options enable investors to own diversified portfolios of dividend stocks that generate passive income.\nExchange-Traded Fund (ETF)\nNo matter which dividend strategy you use, adding dividend stocks to your portfolio can be beneficial. They can help reduce volatility and boost your total returns so you can reach your financial goals a little faster."

      "text": "When you're considering wading into the ocean of dividend-paying stocks, it's important to get a good handle on the terminology. A forward dividend yield is one of a few key metrics you should consider. Understanding this metric can help you make better buying decisions. Read on to learn more.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is a forward dividend yield?\nDividend stocks pay a portion of their earnings back to stockholders through dividends. Dividend yields are calculated by comparing the dividend to the stock's price. For example, a stock might pay $1 per share for the first year you own it at $20, giving you a 5% dividend yield.\nA forward dividend yield tries to predict what the future holds for the stock and the future yield that might be compared to the current stock price. This is generally only useful for stocks that are very consistent with their dividends. It can be very difficult to predict the forward yield for stocks with dividends tied to erratic business.\nHow to determine\nHow do you determine a forward dividend yield?\nDetermining forward dividend yield is a bit like looking into a Magic 8-Ball -- the future is uncertain. But if you're familiar with the company's industry and competitors, you can generally anticipate that the forward yield will be stable or may have to become smaller due to current struggles.\nIf you're confident in the stability of your dividend, it's easy enough to take the most recent dividend (or dividend announcement) and multiply it by the number of dividends paid yearly to get an annualized dividend. Many stocks pay quarterly dividends, and a few pay monthly, so it's important information to know.\nOnce you have your number, simply divide it by the current stock price, and there it is -- your forward dividend. So, if your stock is paying $0.50 this quarter, you'd be getting $2 per year if all remains stable; assuming today's price is $50, that's a 4% forward dividend yield. Here's the formula and result:\nAnnualized dividend / stock price = forward dividend yield\n$2 / $50 = 4%\nOf course, there are also analysts out there who do a much more thorough analysis to come up with predictions for forward dividend yields that may be helpful to track as you shop for your next stock pick. These guys also don't have an infallible Magic 8-Ball, but they do have loads of experience to help them make a very informed guess.\nForward vs. trailing\nForward dividend yield vs. trailing dividend yield\nThere are many ways to look at dividend yield, but the most common are forward yield and trailing yield. These may turn out to be the same, but the two terms look at very different things.\nForward yield is a way to anticipate the upcoming dividends for the year based on the company's dividend history and your best guess at how it will perform in the future. Trailing yields, however, are based on solid historical data and are incredibly easy to verify and support.\nBoth are important when you're thinking about buying a stock. Forward dividend yield, when calculated based on the reality of the stock market and not on an optimistic view, can help you anticipate what you'll earn in the coming year. Trailing yields will tell you what's definitely already happened (and can help you figure out that forward yield).\nWhy they matter\nWhy do forward dividend yields matter to investors?\nInvestors need to see a company from all angles when they're considering investing in it. Buying stock is just like buying a company: You're becoming a partner in the business, even if you have only a small share. So, understanding the potential for dividends in the future also means you understand the potential earnings for your company in the coming year.\nRelated investing topics\nDividend yields, both forward and trailing, are also a good way to eliminate volatility in your portfolio. A huge dividend sounds great but is often a warning sign of issues to come. So, if your forward dividend rests snugly above about 6%, you should seriously consider skipping the stock unless you know of something that is creating an aberration in the yields for this year.\nForward dividend yields are just another tool to better understand what you're buying, as well as the outlook for you and your new partial ownership in the business."

      "text": "Everybody needs healthcare -- or will, at some point. And, when there\u2019s something everyone needs, there\u2019s a huge opportunity for investors.\nAbout $9.8 trillion is spent on healthcare globally. Half of that amount -- around $4.9 trillion -- is spent in the U.S. With the healthcare sector growing significantly faster than the overall economy, the numbers will almost certainly be much larger by the end of the decade.\nHow can investors profit from this growth? Here\u2019s what you need to know about investing in healthcare stocks.\nTypes of healthcare stocks\nDifferent types of healthcare stocks\nThe healthcare sector is so broad that there are several different kinds of healthcare stocks. Four of the most important types are:\n- Drug stocks: Drugmakers focus on developing drugs that treat or prevent diseases. Biotech companies use live organisms such as bacteria or enzymes to develop drugs, while pharmaceutical companies use chemicals. Drug stocks range from huge companies with billions of dollars in sales each year to small biotech firms with no products on the market yet.\n- Medical device stocks: Medical device companies make devices used to care for patients. The devices range from disposable gloves and thermometers to artificial heart valves and robotic surgical systems. Medical device stocks include many health tech stocks, as well as medical equipment stocks.\n- Payer stocks: Payers, including health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), play an especially important role in the U.S. healthcare system. Insurers charge premiums to individuals and employers to pay for healthcare costs, while PBMs administer prescription drug benefits for employers and health plans.\n- Healthcare provider stocks: Healthcare providers stand at the front lines, delivering healthcare services to patients. They include hospitals, physician practices, home health companies, and long-term care facilities.\nTop healthcare stocks\nTop healthcare stocks to buy in 2025\nStrong companies can be found within each type of healthcare stock. We\u2019ll break down at least one example of each with a look at Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX -0.45%), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 1.22%), TransMedics Group (TMDX 0.67%), UnitedHealth Group (UNH 1.34%), and HCA Healthcare (HCA 0.15%).\n- Vertex Pharmaceuticals stands out as one of the top biotech stocks on the market. The company primarily focuses on developing drugs that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare genetic disease that damages the lungs and other organs. Vertex has also expanded beyond CF with gene-editing therapy Casgevy (a one-time treatment for the rare blood disorders sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia) and acute pain therapy suzetregine.\n- Intuitive Surgical is a great example of a medical device stock that also falls into the category of surgical stocks. The company\u2019s Da Vinci robotic surgical system has been used in more than 16 million procedures since its 1999 introduction. Intuitive Surgical also markets Ion, a robotic system for minimally invasive peripheral lung biopsy. Over the long run, the company should have tremendous growth opportunities ahead with an aging population requiring the types of surgical procedures for which Da Vinci is frequently used.\n- TransMedics Group developed and sells the Organ Care System (OCS), a system for transporting lungs, hearts, and livers intended for transplantation. OCS replicates the human body in many ways, keeping donated organs alive until they can be transplanted. TransMedics also created a National OCS Program (NOP) that provides end-to-end services related to organ transplantation, including air transportation. The company has a major growth opportunity in disrupting the organ transplant market.\n- UnitedHealth Group ranks as the largest commercial health insurer in the U.S. It also operates one of the biggest PBMs and is a leader in healthcare delivery services. The company\u2019s size, stability, and dividend make UnitedHealth Group one of the most attractive payer stocks on the market. UnitedHealth Group has also expanded its presence in the healthcare provider market with its 2023 acquisition of home health services provider LHC Group.\n- HCA Healthcare owns and operates 187 hospitals and around 2,400 outpatient facilities including surgery centers, physician clinics, freestanding emergency rooms, and urgent care centers. It's the largest health system operator in the U.S. HCA also operates healthcare facilities in the United Kingdom. The company continues to grow, in large part, by making acquisitions.\nWhat to look for\nWhat to look for in healthcare stocks\nHow do you find the absolute best healthcare stocks to buy? There are four key things to look for:\n1. Growth prospects\nThe most important thing you\u2019ll want to check out with any healthcare stock is the company\u2019s growth prospects. Determine how quickly revenue has grown in recent years. The future doesn\u2019t always mirror the past. However, if a company hasn\u2019t been able to deliver strong revenue growth so far, it probably won\u2019t in the future.\nRead the investor presentations on companies\u2019 websites to learn their strategies for growth and the size of their potential markets. Check out the companies\u2019 rivals to see if their strategies seem to be as good or better. Note that companies will often mention specific competitors by name in their 10-K annual regulatory filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nDon\u2019t overlook the possibility that mergers and acquisitions (M&A) could boost a company\u2019s growth prospects. Companies that have grown through M&A in the past could be looking for new deals to make in the future.\nKeep in mind that deals don't necessarily include an outright purchase of another company. Larger companies sometimes collaborate with smaller players instead of buying them. For example, Vertex Pharmaceuticals teamed up with small biotech CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP 2.82%). The two companies won U.S. regulatory approvals for gene-editing therapy Casgevy in treating sickle cell disease in December 2023 and for treating transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia in January 2024. They're also working together to develop therapies targeting type 1 diabetes.\n2. Financial strength\nThe SEC filings also include statements that can help evaluate the financial strength of a company. Ideally, a company will already be profitable. If it isn\u2019t, make sure you learn how it plans to achieve profitability and how quickly it expects to do so.\nA company\u2019s cash position includes cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. It can be found on the balance sheet (a financial statement that lists all the company\u2019s assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity) in the company's annual and quarterly regulatory filings. Think about cash position the same way you\u2019d think about the amount of money in your checking, savings, and retirement accounts: The more, the better.\nAnother important gauge of financial strength is the free cash flow (FCF) generated by a company. FCF is the cash left over after operating expenses and capital expenditures (which includes money spent on buildings, equipment, and land). As with the cash position, the higher a company\u2019s FCF, the stronger its financial position.\nYour dollars and mine, our capital, is helping shape the world.David Gardner, co-founder, The Motley Fool\n3. Valuation\nYou\u2019d want to know how much a new car is worth before buying it. Determining the value of a healthcare stock before buying it is also important so you can make sure you\u2019re paying a fair price.\nThere are quite a few valuation metrics. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is the most popular and measures the price of a stock in relation to its earnings per share, or what you get in earnings for every dollar you invest.\nSome P/E ratios are backward-looking, or reflecting earnings from a previous period (typically the past 12 months). Forward P/E ratios, which use earnings estimates for one year into the future, can be more helpful in assessing the valuation of fast-growing healthcare stocks. Comparing P/E ratios with other stocks in the same industry will help you determine if the stock is relatively cheap or relatively expensive.\nJust because a stock\u2019s P/E ratio is higher than those of its peers doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good or bad buy. It could indicate that the company\u2019s growth prospects are much better than those of its rivals. Be sure to also check out the stock\u2019s price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which incorporates projected earnings growth rates (typically over five years). Stocks with lower PEG ratios (especially when the ratios are less than 1) are more attractively valued than those with higher PEG ratios.\n4. Dividends\nSome of the best healthcare stocks pay dividends -- a portion of earnings that the company returns to shareholders. Dividends can boost the overall return you receive from owning a stock.\nThe dividend yield tells you how large a stock\u2019s annual dividend payments are as a percentage of the current share price. Consider the stock\u2019s payout ratio, which measures dividends as a percentage of earnings and indicates how much of the company\u2019s cash is being used to cover the dividend. The lower the payout ratio, the greater the likelihood that the company will be able to keep paying dividends in the future.\nRisks\nWhat are the risks of investing in healthcare stocks?\nInvesting in any kind of stock comes with risks, including the possibility that competitors will develop more successful products and services. Healthcare stocks face these risks, as well as others that are more unique to the sector.\nHealthcare is highly regulated. Drugmakers and medical device makers can fail to secure the necessary regulatory approvals to market new products. Regulatory changes can drastically alter a healthcare stock\u2019s growth prospects. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees the regulation of drugs and medical devices. It\u2019s smart to pay attention to any FDA action related to medical stocks you\u2019re watching.\nMany healthcare stocks also face significant litigation risk. For example, biopharmaceutical companies, medical device makers, and healthcare providers can be sued if patients think the companies\u2019 products and services have caused them harm.\nIn addition, drugmakers and medical device makers must convince payers, including health insurers, PBMs, and government agencies, to buy their products. If companies aren\u2019t successful in obtaining reimbursement approvals, their growth prospects can be reduced.\nMany healthcare companies are also highly dependent on Medicare reimbursement levels. Recent changes to Medicare allow the program to negotiate prices for some high-cost drugs with pharmaceutical companies. Some drugmakers' revenues and profits could be negatively affected as Medicare pays less for certain drugs.\nRelated investing topics\nBottom line\nHealthcare stocks should have healthy returns\nDespite these risks, the overall outlook for healthcare stocks appears very good over the long term. Aging demographic trends around the world, combined with advances in technology, should open up tremendous opportunities for healthcare stocks -- and provide healthy returns for patient investors.\nFAQs\nFAQs\nWhat are the best healthcare stocks to buy now?\nMany healthcare stocks are good alternatives for investors to buy now. Some top candidates representing various areas of the healthcare sector include Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Intuitive Surgical, TransMedics Group, UnitedHealth Group, and HCA Healthcare.\nIs it smart to invest in healthcare?\nWhile investors must decide for themselves whether any sector is a good fit for them, healthcare could be a smart area in which to invest for many. Healthcare spending is growing faster than the U.S. GDP as the population ages. This should create significant opportunities for innovative healthcare companies.\nDo healthcare stocks do well in a recession?\nMany healthcare stocks perform relatively well during a recession. Healthcare products and services are usually needed regardless of economic conditions. However, some healthcare stocks might be more affected by recessions than others."

This shouldn't be a surprise. Companies in these sectors tend to pay dividends and raise their prices with inflation, and many have also been in operation for a long time. The list breaks down as follows:\n- 16 industrial companies\n- 16 consumer goods\n- 9 utility stocks\n- 4 healthcare stocks\n- 6 financial stocks\n- 1 energy stock\n- 1 materials stock\n- 1 real estate stock\n- 1 tech stock\nThere aren't any exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus exclusively on Dividend Kings. However, the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL 1.55%) owns shares of all Dividend Aristocrats\u00ae.\nChanges in 2025\nDividend King changes in 2025\nAlthough there's some risk that a potential recession could upend one or more of these dividend streaks, companies that make this list rarely lose their status. There's tremendous pressure on companies that have increased their dividends for 50-plus years to keep their streak going. No CEO wants to be known as the leader who messed up an impressive dividend track record.\nChief Executive Officer (CEO)\nConversely, it takes a half-century to make this list, a rare feat indeed. Yet we have recently seen several companies achieve Dividend King status. Automatic Data Processing joined the exclusive club in 2024. So far in 2025, we have added one new Dividend King, RLI Corp, with its dividend increase in February adding it to the royal list.\nThese stocks are now former Dividend Kings\nDespite management's efforts (or often because of them), not all companies stay on the list. In 2024, two former Dividend Kings cut their payouts, losing status.\nLeggett & Platt (LEG 5.92%) was the first, slashing its dividend in April, ending a 52-year run of dividend growth. 3M (MMM 2.73%) cut its payout more recently, lowering the dividend in May and bringing its six-decade growth streak to an end. In the case of both companies, bloated expenses, weak growth, and a number of acquisitions that haven't gone well played a role in the financial results weakening and eventually leading to a need to cut the payout.\nTwo \"unofficial\" Dividend Kings\nA note on two \"unofficial\" Dividend Kings\nWe have added Canadian Utilities and Tootsie Roll Industries to this list. Both have characteristics that make them Dividend Kings, though some investors may argue they make the cut on a technicality or two.\nCanadian Utilities is certainly a king if you're a Canadian investor; however, the changes in foreign exchange rates have recently made the effective dividend paid to U.S. investors fall. We don't want to shortchange the company or our Canadian investors because of this. The money the company has paid from its coffers every year has indeed increased for 53 years in a row.\nTootsie Roll is a little more complex. To start, the company has a long history of paying a dividend, but the $0.09 quarterly cash portion of the dividend has remained unchanged for years. Its payout has grown via the 3% stock dividend it also pays every year. So long as the stock price increases in value, the total dividends paid grows. We thought this quirk was worth explaining in detail.\nLikely Dividend King winners in 2025\nLikely Dividend King winners in 2025\nThree key factors could affect many stocks in 2025, including several of the Dividend Kings:\n- Inflation\n- Interest rates\n- A possible recession tied to the two factors above\nThese factors could benefit some stocks but hurt others. Here are three Dividend Kings that could be winners in 2025:\n1. Target\nTarget has been on a seriously rough ride in recent years. Like many other big-box retailers, the impact of inflation and supply chain challenges left the company with too many of the wrong goods and rising costs, pressuring its cash flow following the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe expectations of its e-commerce-driven business during the pandemic, along with some continued struggles with inventory and store-level execution, have weighed on its business in recent years, pulling shares to some of the lowest levels in the past five years. And while the business hasn't delivered the growth many expected, it's in far better shape than the stock would have many investors believe.\nIts e-commerce investments and large physical presence are a powerful combination that should serve Target well. Target is a major supplier of consumer staples, and even as consumers feel the pinch on their discretionary spending, Target is built to profit across economic environments.\nTrading for a cheap valuation and paying a safe dividend, Target looks like a great Dividend King to buy today and hold for the long term.\n2. Altria\nSome investors look at the tobacco giant with disdain; others simply won't buy a company whose products cause so much harm. But if that's not a concern for you, Altria should be on your list.\nThe company has had a number of missteps around vaping products in recent years, and its ability to crack the cannabis market isn't clear (nor is the future of cannabis's legality in many of Altria's markets).\nHowever, it continues to generate mountains of cash -- $8.6 billion in free cash flow over the past four quarters -- and returns much of that, $6.8 billion, to shareholders in dividend income. It also sells a product its customers buy across every economic condition, making its sizable dividend safe in every economic environment.\n3. Johnson & Johnson\nAnother Dividend King that's gone through a tumultuous past several years is Johnson & Johnson (J&J). However, the healthcare giant could emerge as a winning stock this year. To start, today's J&J is a more streamlined business, having divested Kenvue, its consumer products business, in 2023. Now, the company is focused on pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and technology exclusively.\nOver the past few years, J&J stock hasn't made for a great investment even with dividend growth, returning under 9% in total over the past three years. However, despite the paltry return in recent years, the five- and 10-year returns are better, at closer to 8% per year on average even with the recent weakness. With the company now lean and focused on its core pharma and medical devices businesses, 2025 could be a great year to add J&J to your long-term dividend growth portfolio.\nFuture Dividend Kings\nFuture Dividend Kings\nHere are some notable companies close to King status, and how long their current dividend growth streak is:\nThere are several large, well-known companies that are also primed to join the Dividend Kings list in the next half-decade. We will update the list as they move closer!\nRelated investing topics\nWhy invest in Dividend Kings?\nWhy invest in Dividend Kings?\nDividend Kings aren't necessarily a good fit for every investor. Many of these stocks frequently deliver relatively low growth and may or may not prove better investments than the stock market average. For example, of the 10 Dividend Kings with the longest records for dividend increases, only one has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 10 years, while six of the 10 have outperformed since 1990.\nIn other cases, their long records of growing payouts can make them reliable income generators, but being a Dividend King is no promise of market-beating returns.\nDividend Kings can be a great component of retirement portfolios or for investors looking for reliable income. Most of these stocks offer higher dividend yields than the average yield of S&P 500 members. Their consistency in paying and increasing dividend payouts can also provide a measure of confidence for anyone, depending on income generated by the dividend stocks they own.\nFAQ\nDividend Kings FAQ\nAre Dividend Kings a good investment?\nIn general, Dividend Kings as a group are solid investments. However, each company presents its own individual risks and opportunities and should not be bought just because it's a Dividend King. That said, as part of a broad, diversified portfolio, Dividend King stocks can be a great way to build and maintain wealth and generate income.\nWhat is considered a Dividend King?\nA Dividend King is a publicly traded company that has both paid and increased a regular dividend every year for at least 50 consecutive years.\nWhat is the highest-yielding Dividend King in 2025?\nAs of late 2024, Altria had the highest yield, about 9.56% at recent prices. The tobacco products giant often has a very high yield, with the stock typically trading for a below-average earnings multiple that keeps shares cheap and the yield high.\nWhat is the highest-paying Dividend King?\nThe Dividend King with the highest yield is Altria, with a 9.56% yield as of late 2024."

      "text": "Two investing truths have proven timeless:\n- Investing in the biggest, strongest companies -- known as blue chip stocks -- is a great way to earn solid returns with a lower risk of loss.\n- Dividend-paying stocks that steadily increase their payouts have the best track record of delivering market-beating total investment returns.\nInvestors seeking a balance of lower risk and steady returns should look at blue chip stocks that pay dividends. Let's take a closer look at these stocks that offer the best of both worlds. They're stalwart companies that meet the blue chip standard and pay a strong dividend to deliver the best returns.\nBlue chip + dividends\nCombining blue chip stock quality with dividends\nA broad definition of a blue chip stock is a well-known, high-quality company that's considered a leader in its industry. The \"blue chip\" descriptor comes from the game of poker, in which blue chips have the highest dollar value.\nNot every blue chip stock pays a dividend. Younger companies, such as Amazon (AMZN 3.12%), still have plenty of valuable opportunities to invest profits back into their business to accelerate growth. Others, such as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.13%)(BRK.B -0.06%), have proven track records of earning high returns by reinvesting their company's profits and with share repurchase programs.\nBut many of the best blue chip companies are also those that pay dividends. Some are Dividend Aristocrats\u00ae (The term Dividend Aristocrats\u00ae is a registered trademark of Standard & Poor's Financial Services). These companies have increased their dividends consistently for at least 25 consecutive years and are part of the S&P 500 index. Other blue chip companies are Dividend Kings, which have increased their dividends for 50 years or more.\nRegardless of whether a blue chip stock has a rapidly growing dividend, the combination of blue chip status and steadily rising dividend payments can be rewarding for investors.\nThe best blue chip dividend stocks\nBest blue chip dividend stocks of 2025\nLet's take a close look at some of the top blue chip dividend stocks:\n| Name and ticker | Market cap | Dividend yield | Industry |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) | $3.4 trillion | 0.45% | Technology Hardware, Storage and Peripherals |\n| Mastercard (NYSE:MA) | $541 billion | 0.49% | Diversified Financial Services |\n| NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) | $157 billion | 2.83% | Electric Utilities |\n| Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) | $1.4 trillion | 0.78% | Semiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment |\n| Realty Income (NYSE:O) | $54 billion | 5.42% | Retail REITs |\nStocks 1 - 2\n1. Apple\nApple (AAPL 1.21%) investors have enjoyed immense returns during the past two decades as the company has risen to become one of the biggest and most profitable in the world. Apple's powerful brand makes it the most lucrative consumer electronics provider and one of the most reliable companies to own for the long term.\nThe foundation of Apple's success is the iPhone, which has enormous user loyalty and generates more than half of Apple's sales. Much of the company's growth in services is derived from its massive iPhone user base. Customers use their smartphones to stream music and movies, play video games, store data, and access media content from thousands of third-party publishers in the App Store.\nApple is also in an enviable position going forward. The deployment of 5G mobile networks in many markets is likely to boost sales of the iPhone. Meanwhile, the company continues to launch innovative new products, like its artificial intelligence (AI) platform Apple Intelligence.\nApple's gradual growth, paired with its increasing dividend payout, is an attractive combination. The stock's dividend yield may be somewhat low, but the company's dividend payout comprises a little less than 15% of Apple's cash flow, meaning that continued dividend growth is likely. Apple has raised its dividend every year since it instituted the payout in 2013. When looking for blue chip stocks that dole out regular and rising income, Apple is a top choice.\n2. Mastercard\nPayment processing giant Mastercard (MA 1.04%) is a blue chip company in the digital payments space. As one of the most recognizable global names in electronic payments, Mastercard has competitive advantages that enable it to maintain its dominant marketplace position. It partners with banks and other lenders that want to issue cards to their customers and simply collects a small fee every time a transaction is processed using its network.\nWith another billion people set to join the global consumer class over the next decade, Mastercard still has plenty of opportunities to expand its payment processing network. Along the way, it's increased the cash it returns to shareholders by a dramatic amount.\nMastercard is ignored by many dividend investors for the simple reason that the dividend yield is low -- only around 0.5% as of mid-2025. However, the company boasts a remarkable record of expanding its dividend payout, raising it by more than 8,300% since paying its first dividend.\nSemiconductor\nStocks 3 - 5\n3. Broadcom\nBroadcom (AVGO 1.48%) isn't exactly a household name among semiconductor companies. The company designs parts for a wide range of items, from smartphones to mobile network equipment to data center hardware. In a world where technology is growing in importance, Broadcom's chips are an absolute staple.\nBroadcom dedicates billions of dollars to research and development every year, so the importance of its products isn't likely to fade anytime soon. Those investments have helped it become an early leader in the AI semiconductor market. That's driving robust growth for the semiconductor and software company.\nManagement's target is to return half of the previous year's free cash flow to shareholders via its dividend. That has led to fantastic income increases for owners of this tech stock.\nBroadcom has increased its dividend for 14 straight years since initiating the payout in its 2011 fiscal year.\n4. Realty Income\nRealty Income (O -1.11%) is one of the largest real estate investment trusts (REITs). The company owns a diversified portfolio of retail, industrial, gaming, and other properties net leased to many of the world's leading companies. That lease structure provides the REIT with stable and growing rental income.\nRealty Income combines a high-quality real estate portfolio with a top-tier balance sheet. It has one of the ten best balance sheets in the sector. That strong financial profile gives the REIT the financial flexibility to continue expanding its portfolio and dividend.\nThe landlord has an incredible track record of paying dividends. As of mid-2025, Realty Income has raised its dividend payment 130 times since its public market listing in 1994. At the time, it has increased its payment for 110 quarters in a row and for 30 straight years. Realty Income has grown its dividend at a 4.3% compound annual rate since coming public. The company's rising dividend has helped support a robust 13.6% compound annual total return since its listing.\n5. NextEra Energy\nNextEra Energy (NEE 0.18%) isn't your typical utility stock. The company is a growing producer of energy -- much of it generated by renewable sources -- that it sells and transfers to utility companies in other markets. The steady demand for electricity that underpins its business, combined with growth in demand for renewable energy, gives NextEra blue chip status.\nNextEra is one of the largest utility companies in the U.S. and among the largest producers of renewable energy in the world. The company benefits partly from being headquartered in Florida, one of the fastest-growing states in terms of both population and solar energy.\nOver the past 20 years, NextEra has grown its dividend at roughly a 10% compound annual rate. That has helped power a more than 15% compound annual return.\nWhile NextEra's dividend yield is comparatively low for its peer group, it more than makes up for it in its growth. NextEra plans to increase its payout by roughly 10% annually through at least 2026.\nRelated investing topics\nShould I invest?\nShould you buy blue chip dividend stocks?\nInvesting in blue chip companies that pay dividends can significantly increase your wealth over time. Although the stock market constantly gains and loses value, these stocks often exhibit below-average volatility while delivering market-beating returns over long time horizons. Blue chip dividend-paying stocks are strong additions to portfolios of all kinds, especially for investors seeking stability and income."

      "text": "Dividend stocks can be a great way to generate passive income. The best ones consistently increase their dividends per share each year.\nHowever, not all companies can routinely increase their dividends. One differentiating factor is the dividend payout ratio. Here's a closer look at this crucial metric for dividend investing.\nDividend payout ratio formula\nDividend payout ratio formula\nA company's dividend payout ratio is the percentage of that company's earnings that it pays out to its investors as dividend income. The dividend payout ratio formula is:\nTotal Annual Dividend Payments \u00f7 Annual Earnings = Dividend Payout Ratio\nSay a company earns $100 million this year and makes $50 million in dividend payments to its shareholders. In this case, its dividend payout ratio would be 50%. You can also use per-share amounts to get the same result. This can be simpler since companies report dividends and earnings in per-share amounts.\nHow to use the dividend payout ratio\nHow to use the dividend payout ratio\nLet's use Apple (AAPL 1.21%) to demonstrate how to calculate the dividend payout ratio using per-share information. As of October 14, 2025, Apple had earned $6.58 per share over the previous four quarters. Its most recent quarterly dividend was $0.25per share, which works out to $0.96 per share annually. Using the dividend payout ratio formula above, we have:\n$0.96 Annual Dividend Payments \u00f7 $6.58 Earnings Per Share = 15% Dividend Payout Ratio\nA good dividend payout ratio\nWhat is a good dividend payout ratio?\nDividend payout ratios tend to vary by industry. Companies that operate in mature, slower-growing sectors that generate lots of relatively steady cash flow may have higher dividend payout ratios. They don't need to retain as much money to fund their business for things like opening new stores, building another factory, or on research and development for new products. For financially strong companies in these industries, a good dividend payout ratio may approach 75% (or higher in some cases) of their earnings.\nHowever, companies in fast-growing sectors or those with more volatile cash flows and weaker balance sheets need to retain more of their earnings. Ideally, it should be less than 50%.\nA safe dividend payout ratio\nWhat is a safe dividend payout ratio?\nWhen you calculate dividends, you'll also want to calculate the dividend payout ratio. A safe dividend payout ratio varies by industry and a company's overall financial profile. For example, one company operating in a stable sector might safely maintain a high dividend payout ratio of 75% of its earnings because it has a strong balance sheet. On the other hand, a competitor in that same industry that has a weaker financial profile might not be able to sustain its dividend if it had a payout ratio that high.\nHistorically, the safest dividend payout ratio has been around 41%, according to research by Wellington Management and Hartford Funds. More dividend stocks with a payout ratio averaging around that level have outperformed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the S&P 500 than those with other payout levels. That's because they can pay an attractive dividend yield while also retaining a significant amount of cash to expand their business. They can also use it on other shareholder-friendly activities such as share repurchases and debt repayment.\nDividends Per Share\nIs a high payout ratio good?\nIs a high dividend payout ratio good?\nA mistake many beginning investors make is to buy stocks with the highest dividend yields they can find. They assume that the higher yield will enable them to earn greater returns.\nUnfortunately, that's not always the case. Many stocks with high yields also have a high dividend payout ratio. That potentially puts them at risk of cutting the dividend if business conditions deteriorate. They're also less likely to increase the amount of dividends paid since they have lower retained earnings. That gives them less wiggle room to increase their payout ratio.\nA better approach is to buy stocks with a lower payout ratio, even if it means sacrificing potential yield to ensure that you own companies that can continue to pay dividends. These companies have more financial flexibility to invest in expanding their earnings, which will enable them to increase their dividends.\nThis is evident in the historical performance of dividend stocks:\n| Grouping | Annual Average Returns (1973-2022) |\n|---|---|\n| Dividend growers and initiators | 10.24% |\n| Equal-weighed S&P 500 Index | 7.68% |\n| No change in dividend policy | 6.6% |\n| Dividend cutters and eliminators | 3.95% |\nAs the table shows, companies that made no change to their dividend policy (i.e., they maintained their payout level) and those that either cut or eliminated their dividends have underperformed the S&P 500 over the past several decades.\nOn the other hand, companies that recently initiated a dividend and those that have consistently increased their dividends -- such as Dividend Achievers and Dividend Kings -- have outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term. That's why investors should seek out companies with a lower dividend payout ratio instead of a higher yield since they're more likely to increase their payouts.\nRelated investing topics\nDon't overlook the dividend payout ratio\nThe dividend payout ratio is a vital metric for dividend investors. It shows how much of a company's income it pays out to investors. The higher that number, the less cash a company retains to expand its business and its dividend.\nGiven the significant outperformance of dividend growth stocks, investors can use the dividend payout ratio to find companies with the flexibility to routinely reward them with more dividend income in the future."

      "text": "Forward P/E is a valuation metric that uses earnings forecasts to calculate the ratio of the share price to projected earnings per share. The \"P\" in forward P/E stands for price, or share price. The \"E\" stands for future earnings per share.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is forward P/E?\nForward P/E is a variation of the price-to-earnings ratio that uses an estimate of earnings over the next 12 months to calculate the metric. Unlike the trailing P/E, which uses actual earnings results from the previous 12 months, the forward P/E is based on estimates, and is therefore subject to errors in forecasting.\nTo combat the potential to get the estimated earnings wrong, the forward P/E is typically calculated using a consensus estimate from all analysts who have published their expectations. This wisdom of the crowd approach typically leads to more accurate estimates.\nHow to calculate it\nHow to calculate forward P/E\nThe formula for calculating a forward P/E ratio is very straightforward.\nForward P/E = Current share price / Estimated future earnings per share\nThe hard part is determining the estimated earnings per share. Several resources provide consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts for big companies. Some companies, however, only have a few analysts (and sometimes none) publishing estimates. In those cases it may be worthwhile to dig into the company financials, management\u2019s commentary, and build your own estimate to aggregate with the professionals.\nAs an example, let\u2019s say a stock currently trades for around $150 per share. Analysts expect it\u2019ll produce earnings per share of $6 over the next year. That stock has a forward P/E ratio of 25.\nHow to use it\nHow to use forward P/E\nCalculating the forward P/E of a stock isn\u2019t very useful in and of itself. To get something out of it, you need to calculate the forward P/E of other comparable stocks.\nComparing the forward P/E of two or more companies within the same industry can give you an idea of whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. If one stock has a P/E far greater than its peers, the stock might not be a very good deal.\nBut there are good reasons why a stock may have a high forward P/E. If analysts expect that company\u2019s earnings per share to grow significantly faster than its peers, it\u2019ll value the next 12 months of earnings far higher than a slow-growing company. That\u2019s because a stock price reflects all the future cash flows of a business, not just the next 12 months.\nIt\u2019s important to consider that a forward P/E uses earnings per share, or EPS, in the denominator. EPS is itself a ratio, which is affected by the number of shares outstanding. So, if a company has plans to buy back a large percentage of its shares outstanding through a share repurchase program, investors may be willing to pay more for its earnings today.\nRelated investing topics\nLimitations\nLimitations of forward P/E\nTo calculate a price-to-earnings ratio, a company needs to have earnings. But not every company produces positive earnings for its shareholders.\nEarly-stage growth companies often produce losses, but their operations show strong potential for earnings at some point in the future. While they invest to grow the business, leverage their fixed operating expenses, and move toward profitability, their stocks technically trade for a negative P/E ratio.\nProfit\nEven when those companies start to make a profit, their relatively minuscule profits relative to the number of shares outstanding can lead to P/E ratios with triple or even quadruple digits. Those valuations aren\u2019t useful for an investing thesis, and forward P/E falls flat in those cases.\nInvestors will be better off finding a different valuation metric to compare growth stocks that are still generating losses for investors. Just because they have extremely high or non-existent forward P/E ratios doesn\u2019t make them bad investments."
