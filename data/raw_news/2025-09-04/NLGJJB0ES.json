      "text": "How about that Wordle puzzle on May 29? The five-letter answer in the New York Times' engaging online word-guessing game probably shattered a few winning streaks, since it begins with the absolute rarest letter in the English language. I never guess that letter except out of total and complete desperation. Personally, I like to stick with starter words that I know feature some of the most frequently used letters. (TRAIN and CLOSE are among my favorites.)\nClick here for today's Wordle hints, as well as our daily answers and hints for The New York Times Mini Crossword, Connections, Connections: Sports Edition and Strands puzzles.\nIn order to get the absolute best starter words, you should know which letters turn up the most in English. I reached out to the big brains at the Oxford English Dictionary -- you know, the whopping, multi-volume dictionary that no one actually owns, but that your school librarian adored. An OED representative sent me a list in which staff analyzed all of the main entries in the concise version of the dictionary.\n\"It's worth noting that the piece is pretty old,\" the OED representative said apologetically. \"It mentions that the stats are from Concise Oxford English Dictionary in 2004, although current colleagues aren't sure when the piece itself was written, and I'm afraid we don't have any newer analysis of this sort.\"\nThe list may be 20 years old, but I'm going with it. The alphabet isn't like ice cream flavors or musical acts -- no new, trendy letters have been introduced in that time. So whether you're just getting into Wordle, or you want to shake up your starter words and make sure they're still hitting the most common letters, this list is for you.\nS begins the most English words\nThe most common letter is no surprise to most people: It's E, and it's immediately followed by another vowel, A. And those letters are much, much more popular than the final two letters in the OED's list, which are J and Q. (Anyone else surprised that J is used less than X and Z?)\n\"The letter E is over 56 times more common than Q in forming individual English words,\" the OED analysis found.\nIt notes that \"there are more English words beginning with the letter S than with any other letter.\"\nSo Wordle players, bookmark this article, and you might find yourself doing a little better in upcoming games. Here are the letters of the alphabet ranked according to how frequently they showed up in the 2004 Concise Oxford English Dictionary.\nThe most common letters used in English\nE\nA\nR\nI\nO\nT\nN\nS\nL\nC\nU\nD\nP\nM\nH\nG\nB\nF\nY\nW\nK\nV\nX\nZ\nJ\nQ"

      "text": "Connections is my favorite puzzle in The New York Times' online game stable. Sure, I play Wordle, Strands, the Mini Crossword and others, but lately, I've been finding myself much more thrilled when I finish a Connections puzzle without making any mistakes than when I solve Wordle in just a few guesses. And don't get me started on that purple category, usually the toughest in the game.\nRead more: Wordle Player Cheat Sheet: Here Are the Most Popular Letters Used in the English Language\nIn Connections, you look at a grid of 16 words and pick four words that have a connection to each other. You do this four times, until all 16 words in the puzzle are grouped. The tough part is that Times associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu chooses words that could fit in multiple groups. The obvious guess -- hey! those are four animals! -- is almost always going to be wrong.\nThere are four different difficulty levels in each game -- each group of four fits in one. Yellow is the easiest, then green, then blue, and the hardest is purple, smugly labeled \"tricky\" by the NYT gamesters. If you make four mistakes, you lose, and the game shows you the answers.\nAnd Connections indeed loves to trick you. One puzzle included the words \"Sponge,\" \"Bob,\" \"Square\" and \"Pants,\" but those words didn't fit in the same category. All of them went in separate groups. Another wanted you to group together the words \"Expose,\" \"Rose,\" \"Pate,\" and \"Resume,\" as four words that are pronounced differently with accent marks. If you saw that one coming, you're a better Connections player than I.\nOne of my favorite jokes about Connections comes from a tweet by Jelisa Castrodale, who wrote, \"I do the NYT's Connections every morning and then spend the rest of the day hating myself because I didn't realize those four names were all doomed whaling ships built in 1832.\" Yep, that's pretty much my life.\nMy top tip\nHere's my absolute favorite tip for playing Connections. If you're stuck, say the words in the grid to yourself, or even out loud, and pause before and after. See what word your mind fills in.\nFor example, say \"litter\" is one of the words. As a cat owner, I say \"litter\" and my mind automatically fills in \"box.\" Now, look and see if there are three other words that could fit in a phrase with \"box,\" like maybe 'jewelry.\"\nButter\" might not just be a dairy product. It might be one of four words that goes with \"fly,\" matching up with \"dragon,\" \"house,\" and \"fire.\"\nThis tip could solve a whole category for you.\nConnections as copycat?\nNote that Connections is pretty much the same game as Connecting Wall from the BBC quiz show Only Connect. Even the show's host pointed that out on X.\n\"Grouped words is a common theme of games,\" a representative for The New York Times told me in an email. \"The content of Connections is unique, handcrafted and has a distinctive style synonymous with New York Times Games.\"\nI've written a lot about Wordle -- from best starter words to a helpful two-step strategy to controversial word changes. I've even rounded up what I learned playing the hit online word puzzle for a full year.\nBut Connections plays on a different part of your brain. Wordle pits you against the dictionary. Connections pits you against your ability to see possible relationships. I still call Wordle my favorite of The New York Times' many online puzzles, but Connections is rising.\nIn addition to my top tip above, here are my other six top tips for how to win at Connections.\nShuffle before you start...\nThis game wants to fool you -- as when \"Sponge,\" \"Bob,\" \"Square\" and \"Pants\" were all in the same game, but not meant for the same group. Connections wants to draw your eyes to easy matches. Hit the \"Shuffle\" button a few times before you try to group the words. You might get a little mental jog if you see that the words you mentally put in one category end up sitting next to another word they match up with in some way.\n...or don't shuffle before you start\nI have to note that a friend vehemently disagrees with this tip. He writes, \"almost always, there is at least one, and sometimes two groups with one entry in each row. Shuffling kills that soft hint and makes you solve from a chaos board.\" His preference? Leave the starting board unshuffled, then look at the bottom right immediately. Then, he looks up row by row, to see if any groupings make sense. So if that seems to work for you, it's another option.\nIf it seems too easy, it probably is\nIn a related tip, never go for the obvious grouping. Basic categories such as colors or numbers or parts of a car might seem evident, but the minute you see an easy group, rethink it. There's a good chance the game is trying to trick you.\nBreak down big words\nHere's a companion tip to the compound-word advice. If the puzzle has a lot of long words, look for a connection between parts of the word. A recent purple category featured words like \"Journeyman\" and \"Rushmore,\" and the connection was that each word started with the name of a rock band.\nLearn from past games\nConnections games can really get creative. The more you play, the more you learn how the editor thinks. You'll start looking at words to see if they have a strange spelling connection, or something like the four words pronounced differently with accent marks. One purple group (it's always the purple group that gets weird) was four words that could be spelled out on an upside-down calculator. (\"Eggshell,\" \"giggle,\" \"hello,\" and that Gen X calculator classic, \"boob.\") Once you've played enough, you start seeing really oddball connections between the words, even if they seem too strange to be real.\nWhen you're one away, rethink\nIf you select three of the four words in a group, the game lets you know you were close, messaging that you were \"One away!\" It's super tempting to just eliminate one of those four and grab another one. But because of how the game sets up similar words, you're likely as not to take away the wrong one. If I get a \"one away\" message, I cancel out all four of the words I just guessed and try for a different bunch of words. That usually helps me eliminate one of the words I had in my original group."

      "text": "The New York Times Games section keeps online gamers busy every day, as they tackle such brain-busters as Wordle, Connections, Strands, the iconic Crossword and its little sibling, the Mini Crossword. (CNET has daily answers for them gathered on our Daily Puzzle Answers page.) Now, players can receive a numeric game score and see how they stack up against competitors. Plus, the new innovation is bringing artificial intelligence into the gaming mix.\nConnections, introduced in June 2023, gives readers 16 words and asks them to sort the words into four related categories. Some of the words could fit in multiple categories, but there's only one solution that will correctly sort all the words. For extra fun, the categories are color-coded, with the purple category being the most difficult.\nBut if just playing the game isn't enough, you can now do more. As of Sept. 3, NYT has introduced the brand new Connections Bot, offering players extra insight into how they played the game each day.\nIt's similar to WordleBot, which was introduced in 2022, and does the same for Wordle. The Times says Wordle Bot garners millions of visits every month, and is one of the Times's most popular features. (For some reason, the Times styles Connections Bot as two words, but WordleBot as one.)\nConnections Bot incorporates the Times newsroom's first regular use of AI.\nHere's how it works: you play Connections, and then visit the Connections Bot to see how you did. The bot will compare your game with that of other players and give you a score of up to 99. To get the perfect 99, you need to win without any mistakes and solve the hardest categories first -- so purple first, blue second, green third and yellow last. (Read the Connections Bot FAQ for more information on scoring.)\nOnce you receive your skill score, the bot uses AI to try and read your mind and determine what you were thinking when you guessed wrong.\nRead more: Win at NYT Connections Every Time With These Seven Hints and Tips\nNYT's first regular use of AI\nFor the July 29 Connections puzzle, for example, it included the words gutter, bowl, lane and alley. You might have tried to put those words together because they all have to do with bowling, but really, they're all meant to be in different categories. The AI will suggest that you might have been thinking of bowling terms, while also noting that you might have tried to group alley with such words as lane and drive, considering them all types of roads.\nThe guesses come from generative AI.\n\"In accordance with The Times's principles for using generative AI,\" the FAQ reports, \"Times editors review all AI-generated responses before they're published and may lightly edit some for clarity and style.\"\nEditor Eve Washington helped create the bot, and told the Times it helps her feel better about the days when she doesn't solve the puzzle.\n\"Connections can be a hard game,\" she said, adding that some days, fewer than 50% of the people who attempt it solve the day's puzzle.\nYou don't need a Times account to play Connections, but you will need one to use the bot.\nRead more: Here Are Today's Answers For Wordle, Connections, Strands and the Mini Crossword"
