  "title": "Beyond time-saving: Generative AI\u2019s shift from speed to decision making",
  "description": "The real AI transformation, already underway",
  "content": "Most people associate Generative AI (GenAI) with time savings. GenAI success stories have made corporate waves as a surefire way to boost efficiency. What was once seen as a flashy, experimental innovation is now tables takes, giving businesses a sophisticated edge.\n\nWhether it be the nine percent of time savings made using GenAI for coding or the three hours shaved off producing marketing content, GenAI has proven its value.\n\nIn a world where speed is everything, saving time is crucial. But with GenAI, we are just scratching the surface. Beyond productivity gains, it\u2019s also enabling sharper decision-making and shaping long-term direction. Its strategic benefits range from revolutionizing market analysis to driving product innovation \u2014 and this is only the beginning.\n\nWhen it comes to market analysis, analysts face a multitude of challenges. With swathes of data available and varying in accuracy and availability, a simple search can quickly become a huge headache.\n\nWith GenAI, many of these obstacles are reduced. Automated data collection paired with real-time analysis saves precious time. But it\u2019s not just about speed. Analysts are empowered with enhanced decision-making. Gen AI tools process pools of information \u2014 from financial reports to customer sentiment data \u2014 to analyze and assess competitors.\n\nGenAI can also evaluate potential synergies across companies. By identifying promising acquisition targets and predicting post-merger performance, for example, this technology can be a powerful tool in helping businesses make complex M&A decisions.\n\nBut what about accuracy? That\u2019s where retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) comes in. By leveraging trusted, citable data sources, RAG mitigates the risk of misinformation. For analysts, purpose-built for business GenAI tools can not only save valuable time, but can be an essential step in making those all-important, and costly, judgement calls.\n\nBy analysing historical data and real-time information, GenAI can also help predict market shifts. From changes in consumer behavior to the rise of new tech or regulation, the technology\u2019s tracking capabilities have torn up the traditional prediction rulebook.\n\nAnd we are already seeing real-world examples of this across industries. Bentley Systems, a construction software company, has used GenAI to help architects design buildings in less time and can simulate changes that would affect their structural design.\n\nBut like most powerful tools, it demands skill and skepticism. A Boston Consulting Group experiment found that 90% of participants improved their performance when using GenAI for creative ideation; however, when applied to business problem-solving there was a 23% decline in performance.\n\nThis was due to participants trusting misleading outputs, showing that, despite all its glory, proper training is needed to truly understand AI\u2019s limitations. The tech may be ready, but unlocking its full value requires skill, training, and a healthy critique.\n\nFor risk managers, the stakes have never been higher. Emerging cyber threats, regulatory overhauls and a very unpredictable geopolitical landscape all mean organizations are exposed to heightened levels of risk.\n\nGenAI is a critical tool for identifying, analysing, and mitigating strategic risks. By processing historical data, market trends and real-time information, AI can highlight potential vulnerabilities and help organizations prepare for a wide range of scenarios.\n\nFor example, AI models can simulate the impact of economic downturns, supply chain disruptions or competitive threats, enabling businesses to develop robust contingency plans. AI\u2019s ability to predict emerging risks, such as regulatory changes or cybersecurity threats, allows corporate strategists to stay ahead of challenges and safeguard organizational resilience, keeping business downtime to a minimum.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just external risk factors that are impacted. 89% of professionals in risk, fraud and compliance recognize the advantages AI brings to their sector when it comes to internal compliance. For those on the front-line of risk, GenAI is proving to be transformative, helping them navigate an increasingly complex bureaucratic landscape.\n\nWhat does this mean for business leaders?\n\nGenerative AI is not just a tool for enhancing efficiency, it\u2019s a strategic enabler that can redefine how businesses operate, compete and thrive. The potential for reshaping market analysis, spotting emerging opportunities and navigating strategic risks demonstrates its transformative impact across industries.\n\nBut, realizing these benefits requires careful planning and execution. Companies must prioritize integrating AI tools into their existing processes, such as CRM platforms and financial analytics tools, while ensuring reliability and accuracy.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to integrate GenAI. It\u2019s quite another for teams to be using it effectively, understanding both its capabilities and limitations. Comprehensive training programs can mitigate risks, such as overreliance on misleading outputs, while fostering confidence in AI-driven insights.\n\nAI adoption should be treated as an evolving process. For business leaders, it\u2019s their responsibility to regularly evaluate its impact, assess risk, adjust strategies as needed and keep up with advancements in the technology to maximize value.\n\nGenerative AI is more than a tool for saving time; it\u2019s reshaping how organizations make decisions and lead in an increasingly dynamic and competitive world.\n\nWe list the best business intelligence platforms .\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Agentic AI vs generative AI: why the future\u2019s not just smarter\u2014it\u2019s bolder\nBreak down differences of Generative and Agentic AI\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to feel like a giant word salad. LLMs here, multimodal there, generative, foundation models, agentic\u2014buzzwords bouncing around like a Slack channel gone rogue. But tucked between all that noise is something quietly revolutionary: agentic AI. And if you\u2019re a CEO, tech investor, or just someone whose calendar looks like a battlefield of overlapping meetings\u2026 you might want to pay attention. Let\u2019s break it down.\nVP for Solutions & GTM Strategy at App Orchid.\nGenerative AI: The genius with no to-do list\nBusinesses adore Generative AI for its ability to complete routine tasks. Whether summarizing documents or creating social media visuals, it\u2019s already transforming industries, with McKinsey reporting that 71% of organizations use it in at least one business function. Early adopters are already seeing impressive returns, delivering an average of $3.70 in value for every dollar invested.\nYou\u2019ve undoubtedly seen generative AI in action\u2014chatbots that write like Hemingway, image tools that can paint a Studio Ghibli cat playing chess with Einstein, the tools that code. It\u2019s impressive. But here\u2019s the catch\u2014it\u2019s passive.\nWhile both Generative and Agentic AI spring from similar foundational technologies, their applications diverge significantly. Simply put, Generative AI doesn\u2019t initiate. It reacts. You ask, it answers. You prompt, it paints. You guide, it follows. And for a while, that was enough. We built content generators, piloted promising tools, and deployed internal copilots for knowledge management. But now the question is shifting\u2014from \u201chow smart is the output?\u201d to \u201cwhat actions can it take?\u201d\nThat\u2019s where things get interesting.\nMeet Agentic AI: The self-starter with an agenda\nAgentic AI isn\u2019t just smart. It\u2019s assertive. These systems aren\u2019t just responding\u2014they\u2019re deciding. They\u2019re setting goals, making plans, and executing them, all (mostly) without your nudging.\nIf Generative AI is like a talented artist creating stunning works on command, think of agentic AI as a highly competent chief of staff. You give it a direction\u2014\u201cimprove customer churn\u201d\u2014and it starts to act. It looks at retention data, cross-checks CRM logs, generates hypotheses, triggers outreach campaigns, and, crucially, updates its approach as new data rolls in. All while you\u2019re in a different meeting entirely. Agentic AI uses reasoning, decision-making algorithms, and environment-based data to act and adapt.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nWhat truly sets Agentic AI apart is its ability to harness the distributed nature of knowledge and expertise. Traditional AI often operates within fixed boundaries, following predetermined paths. Agentic systems can break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks, identify the right specialized agents for these sub-tasks, then orchestrate interactions between agents to synthesize solutions efficiently.\nIt\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s unnerving. And it\u2019s coming fast.\nWhere it\u2019s already showing up (even if we didn\u2019t call it that)\nAgentic AI might sound like something from a sci-fi novel, but it\u2019s not an abstract concept on the distant horizon. It\u2019s already orbiting, quietly making itself indispensable in multiple industries. For instance, AutoGPT has laid the foundation for this technology by combining tools like GPT-4 and vector databases. While not flawless, it showcases the skeletal structure of agency in action.\nTake Devin, an autonomous AI software engineer, as another example. Devin does more than just churn out code. It reads specifications, reviews repositories, and even submits pull requests. Then there\u2019s Rewind AI, which builds memory-driven agents that remember your digital activity, enabling them to take actionable steps proactively.\nOr consider where Siri and Google Assistant are headed. Beyond just answering questions; it will book appointments, make purchases, and handle tasks on your behalf. This isn\u2019t just intelligence we\u2019re talking about\u2014it\u2019s initiative. And it represents an entirely new paradigm in how technology engages with humans and that\u2019s a whole new animal.\nOkay, but why should businesses care?\nIf generative AI was about productivity, agentic AI is about orchestration and autonomy of decision making. Imagine an operations department where AI isn\u2019t just used in workflows but actively manages them. They could approve routine requests, identify bottlenecks, and adjust processes to maximize efficiency.\nSales teams could further benefit from AI assistants that do more than score leads. Agents could initiate contact, schedule calls, share documents, and even assign post-meeting tasks, keeping the momentum going seamlessly. Meanwhile, in finance, AI agents could identify recurring errors, automate compliance reports, or optimize cash flow processes without needing constant human intervention.\nEven recruitment could see a transformation with agentic AI. Imagine AI that proactively searches for candidates, vets their profiles, and initiates first contact before your hiring manager even begins their day.\nEssentially, agentic AI flips the script. It doesn\u2019t just generate answers. It acts. It executes. It adapts. And honestly? It might be the closest thing we\u2019ve got to cloning your best team member and equipping them with limitless energy and focus.\nStealable ideas: Agentic AI use cases you can test now\nYou don\u2019t have to wait for some polished VC-backed platform to start exploring what agentic AI can do for your business. My advice is to start small but think big. Deploy agentic systems in clearly defined areas where success can be measured. Execute well, then use those success stories to justify broader investments. Tangible wins can demonstrate ROI and build the case for confident adoption.\nFor example, you could deploy project agents to oversee task lists, ensuring that the right people are kept informed and that project timelines adjust dynamically when necessary. Customer agents can handle service tickets autonomously, only escalating issues to human agents when empathy or a nuanced touch is required. Finally, talent agents could take the lead on building passive candidate pipelines, handling initial outreach, and drafting those crucial first-touch emails.\nAgentic AI is no longer just a concept; it\u2019s quietly proving its worth across industries, paving the way for a future where technology doesn\u2019t just assist but acts.\nHere\u2019s the thing, though\u2014it\u2019s not about replacing people. It\u2019s about giving them back the 40% of their day they spend nudging, chasing, checking, and\u2026 sighing.\nBut, let\u2019s not automate the chaos\nLook, agentic AI isn\u2019t a golden goose. Agentic AI relies heavily on accurate, high-quality data. Without clean, structured data, it cannot reason effectively or make sound decisions. Enterprises need a centralized semantic layer to bridge disconnected data silos. By building knowledge graphs that organize data into meaningful business entities, companies can ensure agents have the right context to operate within and make accurate decisions.\nKeep in mind these systems can still hallucinate. They can act too quickly or without enough context. And when you hand off autonomy, even partially, you\u2019re entering a zone that demands trust and control.\nAgents act autonomously, but with greater power comes the need for stricter control. One common risk is the improper allocation of roles, where agents might access sensitive information.\nThe solution? Guardrails. Clear policies. Audit trails. And maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014a human in the loop, especially early on. Trust grows over time with consistent accuracy and insights.\nPowerful? Absolutely. But infallible? Not even close.\nThe real question: Are you waiting to be disrupted?\nAgentic AI flips the script. It doesn\u2019t wait for instructions\u2014it looks for problems to solve. It\u2019s less a tool, more a teammate (with an unsettling amount of caffeine).\nSo the real ask here isn\u2019t whether this tech is coming. It\u2019s whether you\u2019re testing it now\u2014or waiting for a competitor who already is. Whether you're using a single agent to optimize a supply chain or orchestrating an entire ecosystem of specialized AI systems, Agentic AI is not just optional anymore. It\u2019s essential.\nBecause here\u2019s the truth: AI that paints pictures is cool. But AI that sends emails, reschedules meetings, flags budget leaks, and follows up with clients while you\u2019re asleep?\nThat\u2019s a game-changer.\nAnd it\u2019s already knocking.\nWe've featured the best AI website builder.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best business intelligence platform of 2025\nBI tools for visual insights from your data\nThe best business intelligence platforms make it simple and easy to mine data for insights to communicate to stakeholders.\nNow that organizations can now collect data on every aspect of their business, from sales and marketing, to workflows and productivity, to hiring and HR, to overall performance and profitability, the ability to sort through all this data for real and actionable insights has never been so important.\nHowever, many of these data points exist in isolation and require dedicated business intelligence (BI) tools to tie in key information from each angle into an overall whole.\nThis can then allow for real insights and predictions for improving business performance, not least through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). A number of software packages also come with their own analytics, but these can also often be exported into a business intelligence platform.\nEven more importantly, the best BI software will be driven by visualizations you can share with stakeholders, to help communicate sometimes complex statistics as easy to understand charts and diagrams.\nHere then are the best business intelligence tools for business currently available.\nWe've also highlighted the best productivity gadgets for business.\nThe best business intelligence platform of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest free business intelligence platform\n1. Microsoft Power BI\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSoftware behemoth, Microsoft, also plays in the business intelligence tool space, and their offering is Microsoft Power BI. They even have a Microsoft Business Applications Summit that features their Power BI, and not surprisingly other Microsoft business applications. Unlike some of their competition that take a totally web-based portal approach, Power BI also offers downloadable software, so you can run your analytics either in the cloud or via a reporting server.\nThere is a generous sixty day trial of the software, which promises to \u201cConnect hundreds of data sources,\u201d including Microsoft applications, and other sources such as Facebook, Sybase and Oracle which can then prep data for subsequent data analysis on the fly, allowing reports to be created in just a matter of minutes.\nPricing begins at the Power BI Desktop tier for a single user, which is fully functional, and free. The next tier up is Power BI Pro and supports collaboration between users, and real time data analysis, and includes a 60 day trial.\nTake a look at our Microsoft discount codes for the best Microsoft offers and savings.\nBest business intelligence platform for analytics\n2. Tableau Desktop\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTableau Desktop endeavors to do more than make charts, but rather to show \u201clive visual analytics.\u201d A slick interface with drag and drop buttons allows the user to quickly be able to spot trends in the data. There is a lengthy list of supported data sources, including Microsoft Excel, Google Analytics, Box and PDF files.\nTableau enjoys the ability to connect with pretty much any type of database, as well as use a whole range of data blending options, to output into an even bigger selection of charts. Dashboard visualizations can be easily shared, and are mobile friendly.\nTableau Desktop becomes an expensive option for a single user, making this more expensive than other competing solutions. On balance, it also includes the associated application of Tableau Prep under the Tableau Creator package.\nBest simple business intelligence platform\n3. Dundas BI\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDundas is a browser based business intelligence tool with 25 years of experience. It is designed to be a single tool to transform data into visual data analytics with \u201cgranular control over almost all visual design elements.\u201d\nData files can be incorporated with drag and drop functionality allowing end users to analyze data without involvement from IT. The HTML5 interface allows it to be used across a variety, including mobile, devices.\nThere is a free 45 day trial, but after the pricing is opaque and requires a quote, but there are options to lease annually, or own for perpetuity.\nBest web-based business intelligence platform\n4. Zoho Analytics\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nZoho Analytics is the business intelligence tool from the folks that have plenty of experience with web-based business tools, namely the venerable Zoho Office. Zoho Reports is a robust solution, that can integrate data from a variety of files, including Microsoft Office documents, URL feeds, and databases, such as MySQL, along with applications, of course from Zoho, but also outside their ecosystem including data from the cloud from Box, DropBox, Google Drive and other applications (for example Salesforce, Quickbooks and Google Analytics).\nData can then be blended via integrated mathematical and statistical formulas, for example marketing costs in an Excel file, with sales data in a cloud database, to create a visually attractive and informative report. This is all done via a simple online interface, and functions can be applied via a simple drag and drop, with reports that can be easily viewed via the portal, or also printed or emailed.\nBest business intelligence platform for enterprises\n5. Sisense\nReasons to buy\nSiSense is a business intelligence tool that seeks to simplify the complexities of data analysis by building in IoT, machine learning and AI into their platform. They claim it is so simple and streamlined, that you can go from \u201cdata to dashboard in just 90 minutes.\u201d While we can argue the validity of that claim, their list of clients, including the likes of GE, Philips, Fujitsu, NBC and Airbus would back up that this is a top tier product.\nMain features include the ability to embed white label analytics with customizations, mashup live or cached data, analyze data across your entire landscape or focus on specific areas such as object, data, or system.\nSisense is an enterprise BI program that can be run in the cloud, or on premises. However, there no flat-rate pricing is provided for either model. Their custom pricing is based on an annual subscription model, but it requires a price quote, and is unfortunately not available on their website.\nOther business intelligence tools to consider\nWe've only scratched the surface when it comes to BI, as there are many providers in the market. However, the caveat is always that a software platform is only as good as its programmers, and data always needs to be the best quality - too many managers presume that processes and workflows are being correctly followed when they may not be and therefore undermine analyzes. Additionally, while there are comprehensive BI tools available there are also ones that focus on particular areas, such as sales or distribution, in order to provide more detailed and focused insights:\nLooker is another full-spectrum analytics and business intelligence platform that provides real-time reporting. To get the most out of it some MySQL knowledge would be helpful, but training materials are provided as required. Even without, Looker is an easy to use platform for data discovery that can accommodate a number of third-party sources.\nQualtrics Research Core is more focused on working through developing, collating, and analyzing survey data, and uses its own AI to tease out trends and actionable insights. This can be especially useful when applied to sales and marketing campaigns for analyzing not just results but can also be used to identify ideal price points.\nAdobe Analytics is a tool especially dedicated to tracking the customer journey online, and provides data to analyze how to more effectively engage with them according to their sources, ie, social media. It's able to work with complex databases to generate quick results, which can then be exported or printed easily.\nWe've also featured the best business laptops.\nBest business intelligence platform FAQs\nWhich business intelligence platform is best for you?\nWhen deciding which business intelligence platform to download and use, first consider what your actual needs are, as sometimes cheaper software may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a more expensive platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, higher-end software can really cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your business intelligence platform.\nHow we tested the best business intelligence platform\nTo test for the best business intelligence platform we first set up an account with the relevant software provider, then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations, analyzing data from different sources and looking at different ways to present the results. The aim was to push each business intelligence platform platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Harnessing the chaos: the strategic imperative of the Generative AI era\nThe intelligent enterprises of the future start with compliance\nThe world has been captivated by the sheer magic of generative AI. In what felt like an instant, we were handed a technology capable of creating endless streams of enterprise knowledge \u2014 from customer support scripts and detailed technical manuals to entire marketing campaigns and even lines of code. The first phase of this revolution was one of chaotic, yet thrilling, experimentation. But the novelty is giving way to a stark reality: Creating an avalanche of information isn\u2019t a strategy. It's a liability.\nAt the Responsible AI Summit in June 2025, the urgency was palpable. Across every conversation I had, one truth kept resurfacing: The very tools designed to drive innovation and accelerate growth could just as easily expose us to risks. What was once seen as a \u2018golden ticket\u2019 of sorts is now being viewed through a sharper lens \u2014 one that reveals reputational risks, regulatory landmines, and the potential for operational chaos if left unchecked.\nChief Product Officer at Acrolinx.\nThe second act of generative AI: compliance\nWe\u2019re now entering the second, more critical act of this technological shift. The primary challenge is no longer about generation, but about governance and scale across the entire organization. The siloed, human-centric workflows that have managed our information pipelines for decades are breaking under the strain of this new volume. It's not lost on me that the generative AI boom has made content production quicker and easier than ever. But speed without oversight is a liability.\nThe strategic imperative has shifted from creating more content to creating the right content, reliably and with purpose, regardless of its function. The companies that thrive will be those that move from frantic experimentation to building a unified, strategic creation engine.\nEvery piece of content either builds your brand \u2014 or breaks it. Whether it\u2019s content that strays from brand guidelines, defies industry standards, or is misaligned with regulatory compliance, these missteps in content expose your organization to legal, financial, and reputational risks. We\u2019re seeing the consequences of poor quality content unfold in real-time.\nThe infrastructure behind AI intelligence\nThis requires building a new kind of digital factory for enterprise intelligence. This isn't just a metaphor; it's an operational necessity built on three pillars.\nAt the heart of it\u2019s a robust MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) pipeline specifically designed for the nuances of generative models, serving as the factory's core assembly line. With generative AI models demanding continuous tuning, evaluation, and oversight, MLOps is what\u2019s behind running the engine, adapting to evolving enterprise needs, and preventing misuse before it occurs.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nSecond, a mastery of prompt engineering, which acts as the skilled artisan, ensures the AI\u2019s output is refined and aligned with specific departmental intent. Generative AI will only ever be as good as its inputs and the instructions it\u2019s given. Prompt engineering acts as a quality control in translating business context into meaningful, actionable outputs \u2014 each purpose-built for the teams that need it.\nFinally, a network of powerful APIs serves as the distribution network, seamlessly integrating this new creation engine into every facet of the business, from technical authoring platforms to conversational AI interfaces. Embedding AI into the platforms that employees are already using, APIs bring new capabilities into everyday, scalable workflows.\nTogether, these three pillars move you beyond fragmented AI experiments and into operational reality. They create a foundation where AI becomes a native part of how your business runs: Consistently, safely, and at scale.\nDefining quality by determinism\nYet, even with a perfect factory, a fundamental question remains: What\u2019s \"good\" content when it could be anything from a line in a legal contract to a spoken response from a chatbot? Quality is no longer subjective; it must be defined by accuracy, consistency, and safety. This is where we must install creative guardrails.\nThe answer lies in a concept that seems at odds with generative AI\u2019s nature: Determinism. While AI\u2019s probabilistic power is the source of its creativity, an enterprise requires certainty. We need a technical document to cite the correct API endpoint every time. We need a support chatbot to follow a specific, compliant troubleshooting protocol. We need our legal boilerplate to be exact.\nBy embedding deterministic rules into our AI systems, we don\u2019t stifle innovation; we create a safe space for it to flourish. These guardrails are the mechanism that safeguards that whether the output is for marketing, engineering, or customer support, it\u2019s verifiably accurate and trustworthy.\nBuilding the intelligent enterprises of the future\nLooking ahead, this controlled, strategic approach will unlock a future of knowledge that\u2019s truly dynamic and multi-modal. We\u2019re on the cusp of creating interactive, voice-navigated repair manuals for technicians in the field, real-time multilingual voice support for global customers, and hyper-personalized onboarding documents for new employees. As data from McKinsey suggests, this level of personalization and efficiency lifts revenues by 5-15% and dramatically improves operational effectiveness, turning a universal business function into a powerful engine for growth.\nThe era of siloed experimentation with generative AI is over. The competitive advantage now belongs to those who can master it as a unified, enterprise-wide capability. The leaders of the next decade will be the ones building their intelligent information factories today, harnessing the chaos to create value that is not only innovative but also intentional, consistent, and mission-critical. The revolution is here; it\u2019s time to give it direction.\nWe've featured the best AI website builder.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Is the window for generative AI adoption closing for companies?\nWhy AI infrastructure decisions can\u2019t wait\nThe technology world is no stranger to hype cycles, but the arrival of generative AI marks something fundamentally different: not a wave of disruption, but a new epoch in digital transformation. Just as cloud computing redefined business operations in the last decade, generative AI is poised to reshape how entire industries operate.\nIt\u2019s important to note that generative AI should not be seen as an incremental tool for productivity, but as a foundational capability that will dictate tomorrow\u2019s winners and losers. In the next 12 to 18 months, companies that strategically embrace AI will redefine their value propositions, business models, and operational capacity. Those that hesitate risk being left behind in what is becoming an increasingly divided digital economy.\nThis emerging divide signals what could be seen as a \u201cDivergent Future\u201d \u2013 a world where companies with access to powerful AI capabilities accelerate exponentially, while those without face systemic disadvantages. The division won\u2019t just be commercial, it will be societal. Access to AI tools is already beginning to impact education, economic mobility, and organizational competitiveness. Companies with the foresight to invest and the means to implement will shape markets; those without may find themselves more and more struggling to compete.\nSo, is the window closing? It depends on how fast you're moving. The companies that act decisively now by investing in sovereign, sustainable AI infrastructure and rethinking how their people and processes create value, are the ones most likely to lead in this new era. For those who hesitate, catching up may soon become not just difficult, but impossible.\nCCO, Nscale\nAI sovereignty as a strategic priority\nAs demand for AI infrastructure surges globally, sovereign infrastructure is quickly becoming a key differentiator. But AI sovereignty isn't about ticking compliance boxes, it\u2019s about having true control. This means owning your infrastructure, ensuring independence from foreign entities, managing proprietary data entirely within a given jurisdiction, and maintaining legal autonomy. These four areas \u2013 infrastructure control, foreign independence, data ownership, and legal autonomy \u2013 form the basis of meaningful AI sovereignty.\nRecent shifts in geopolitical sentiment, especially regarding data residency and access, are driving demand for AI infrastructure located outside the jurisdiction of US-based hyperscalers. Sovereign cloud infrastructure offers organizations \u2013 especially those in regulated sectors such as finance, healthcare, and government \u2013 a secure alternative that avoids exposure to extraterritorial legislation like the US Patriot Act.\nBut genuine AI sovereignty doesn\u2019t come from a sticker that says, \u201clocal cloud.\u201d It requires intentional design - where your data lives, who owns the IT infrastructure, and where the provider itself is based all matter. Without aligning all three, claims of sovereignty can fall apart under scrutiny.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nHowever, the AI landscape is rarely quiet, and recent political developments have only added to its complexity. In the United States, the Biden administration introduced the BIS diffusion bill, a policy designed to control global distribution of GPUs. Under the framework, countries are categorized into tiers, with allied nations such as the UK and most of Europe granted wider access, while others face restrictions or outright bans. This has significant implications for AI development, creating a controlled environment for where infrastructure can be located.\nIn this new reality, companies can\u2019t afford to treat infrastructure strategy as a back-office decision. Companies must now factor geopolitical volatility, supply chain dynamics, and regulatory risks into their AI infrastructure strategies.\nThe environmental cost of AI: What questions companies must ask\nThe environmental footprint of AI cannot be ignored. With large-scale model training and inference workloads becoming the norm, data centers are consuming more energy than ever before. A single AI GPU today can draw over 1,200 watts, equivalent to 12 standard laptops. In aggregate, these GPUs are housed in facilities that can contain tens of thousands of units, representing a significant strain on energy systems globally.\nSustainability must be built into the process from the start. That begins with selecting data center locations based on proximity to abundant renewable energy. Unlike traditional infrastructure, AI data centers don\u2019t need to be close to urban areas. They can be strategically located in regions with surplus wind, hydro, or solar energy, as long as they have the right fiber connectivity to handle real-time data flows.\nHowever, despite this flexibility, many hyperscalers continue to site infrastructure in fossil-fuel-dominated grids, and there is often a lack of transparency in how energy is sourced or used. Companies should ask tough questions about where their AI workloads are running, what powers them, and what emissions are associated with that usage. Without this accountability, greenwashing will continue to undermine genuine sustainability efforts.\nData centers also need to be built for long-term efficiency. This includes using the latest generation of GPUs and implementing modular architecture that supports hardware swaps without costly retrofits. Advanced cooling systems are equally critical. Traditional air cooling just isn\u2019t enough anymore. Closed-loop liquid cooling systems should become the norm, as they\u2019re much more efficient and use less water, which helps protect local water resources.\nSelecting AI infrastructure is no longer just a technical decision \u2014 it is a sustainability commitment that demands rigorous due diligence on energy use, location strategy, and cooling technologies. Companies must embed environmental considerations into their AI strategy from the outset, asking the hard questions when selecting an AI cloud partner.\nStrategic timing: The 12\u201318-month window\nWe are now in a critical phase. The next 12 to 18 months represent a strategic window for companies to act. The market is maturing rapidly, foundational models are stabilizing, and the tools to deploy AI effectively across sectors are becoming more accessible.\nBut this accessibility comes with responsibility. Companies must think strategically about how they deploy AI. This means more than just selecting a tool or API. It\u2019s time to align AI with business models, workforce planning, ethical values, and environmental goals. This should be accompanied by selecting AI infrastructure partners who provide sovereignty and sustainability.\nThe risk of waiting is real. Late adopters will not only miss early efficiency gains, but may find themselves structurally disadvantaged in adapting to a world where AI dictates economic competitiveness. The divide will grow, and catching up will become significantly harder.\nAI isn\u2019t a \u201cmaybe\u201d anymore - it\u2019s foundational. It\u2019s going to be a key factor in defining competitive advantage, not just for companies, but for entire nations and economies in the years to come. But with this shift, we need to think long-term. We need to build AI infrastructure that is scalable, ethical, sovereign, and sustainable. We must regulate AI in ways that protect society without paralyzing innovation. And we should recognize that in this era, performance alone is not enough. Trust, responsibility, and transparency will be just as important as speed and scale.\nWe list the best business cloud storage.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

He has now been the Editor in charge of all things CRM at TechRadar for over 10 months and has a passion for offering experience backed advice on which CRM is best for you.\nMy top 3 best CRMs\nBest CRM for most businesses, in most cases: Salesforce\nSalesforce is a global CRM leader that offers advanced, customizable tools with a user-friendly interface and impressive reporting capabilities. While comparable to competitors like Zoho CRM, Salesforce's upper-tier plans justify their higher cost with features like Workflow Automation and advanced reporting. With intuitive customization options and robust support resources, Salesforce empowers teams to streamline workflows and boost productivity.\nBest CRM for midsize businesses: Workbooks\nWorkbooks offers comprehensive CRM solutions tailored for midsize businesses, covering customer service, sales, marketing, and operations. Its standout feature is the Shared Success program, providing clients with free consulting hours and annual workshops for continuous alignment with business goals. While the free version is restricted to two users and lacks advanced features, paid tiers offer a greater level of flexibility.\nBest CRM for free: HubSpot\nHubSpot CRM stands out with its free plan, offering comprehensive features like contact management, call and email logs, and integrations with popular apps. It also includes advanced functionalities like email scheduling and Facebook Messenger integration. Needless to say, a free plan with so much power makes it ideal for cash-strapped startups or small businesses with a limited budget.\nPaid plans unlock additional capabilities from HubSpot's Marketing, Sales, and Service Hubs, allowing seamless integration across platforms.\nThe best CRM software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest CRM software overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSalesforce is a global leader in CRM, with advanced, customizable functionality, user-friendly design, and outstanding reporting tools. The company proudly states on its website that \u201c98% of customers meet or exceed their ROI goals,\u201d which is seriously impressive.\nFeatures\nThe core CRM platform is Salesforce Sales Cloud, which can be integrated with Marketing Cloud for email automation or with Einstein Analytics for AI-powered business intelligence, among others.\nIn use, Salesforce Sales Cloud is intuitive and focuses on getting your leads over the line, but you can customize a significant part of your interface to suit your team\u2019s needs, from dashboards to reports and contact forms.\nThe support requires a login to connect directly. I did find the sales number in multiple places, but not any support number or email, giving us pause on any potential difficulty for direct communication should the need arise. Furthermore, there is a help area of the website with self-help content via a searchable database.\nHigher-level plan features include Workflow Approval and Automation, which can automate standard business processes, and Sales Teams that can designate the members of the team to work on the individual deal.\nFurthermore, on top of pipeline management, call and email logs, and customizable contact management, Enterprise plans and above include advanced reporting and prediction, app development, full sandbox, sophisticated process automations, and external system integrations via web services APIs.\nIn large organizations, the app development and sandbox features can help make teams even more productive by customizing permissions and workflows across territories, customer verticals, and sales funnel stages.\nPricing and plans\nWith so many different options and modules to consider, summarizing Salesforce pricing can be tricky. The core plan (Salesforce Sales Cloud) is broken into two pricing structures targeted at SMBs and enterprises.\nSMB pricing starts at $25/user/month, which gives you access to a simple CRM suite. If you want access to an enhanced CRM suite with more sales, marketing, and commerce tools, you'll need to upgrade to the Pro Suite plan at $100/user/month.\nEnterprise users have access to three plans. The first 'Enterprise' plan costs $165/user/month and offers more flexibility and Web API. Upgrade to the 'Unlimited' plan at $330/user/month, and you get intelligent automation and developer support built in. Finally, go for the 'Einstein 1 Sales' plan at $500/user/month, and you get everything from the 'Unlimited' plan plus Einstein Copilot Powered by Generative AI.\nAlternatives\nAlthough Salesforce is the best for most businesses, in some cases, it isn\u2019t necessarily the right fit. For example, if cash-strapped businesses are looking for the best CRM for startups, Salesforce can be expensive. HubSpot is a great alternative in this case, offering plenty of functionality on its free plan.\nSupport\nSalesforce offers 24/7 support through multiple channels, including phone, email, and live chat. Their extensive knowledge base and active community forums provide additional resources. However, the quality of support can vary depending on your plan level.\nMy verdict\nThe cost of Salesforce can get expensive on the upper tiers, considering that it is billed per each individual user. While there is also no free tier, I do appreciate the 30-day free trial that is available without a credit card, and does not require any software download. Another benefit is that the pricing is upfront, transparent, with a long list of features designated by the plan for ease of comparison.\nRead our full Salesforce CRM review\nBest CRM software for midsize businesses\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWorkbooks is an excellent CRM for midsize businesses, offering solutions for customer service, sales, marketing, and operations teams.\nFeatures\nIts primary differentiator is its Shared Success program, which gives customers access to free consulting hours, along with annual workshops to ensure that Workbooks continues to align with a client's business goals.\nWorkbooks lacks a diverse third-party app marketplace or developer community, unlike competitors such as Salesforce and HubSpot. Therefore, it might not be the best choice for users who require a large number of third-party customizations.\nIn addition, its free version is limited to only two users and has fewer features, which could make it less appealing to very small businesses. It also requires a business email, along with a phone number to sign up, but it does not require a credit card.\nPricing and plans\nPlans are broken into 3 tiers. The entry 'CRM' plan costs $43/user/month and offers all the basic CRM features you would expect. Upgrade to the 'Business' plan for $88/user/month and you'll get extra features including sales order management, supplier purchase orders, and invoice/credit notes. The 'Events' plan starts at $183/user/month and offers event-specific features such as ticket sales and sponsorships, online event registration, and check-ins.\nIt is important to note that the prices mentioned above are just starting prices, with each option coming with a host of optional extras at an additional cost.\nAlternatives\nIf Workbooks\u2019 2-person free plan limit is an issue for you, HubSpot may be a more suitable option. For more advanced functionality, you may also want to consider Salesforce, but do remember that if you go down that route, you\u2019ll likely end up paying significantly more.\nSupport\nHaving had the opportunity to speak to several of Workbooks\u2019 long-term customers in person, one key theme became clear - willingness to collaborate. According to its customers, Workbooks is proactive in helping them get the most out of the CRM platform. This is through a combination of training courses and consultations with the Workbooks team, which are built into the onboarding process.\nOther CRM platforms certainly provide similar services, but usually at a (sometimes substantial) additional cost.\nOnce Workbooks is rolled out across your company, you'll receive exceptional customer support with personalized assistance and a hands-on approach to implementation. Their team of experts offers guidance throughout the onboarding process and beyond, ensuring you maximize the platform's potential for your business.\nMy verdict\nI note the lack of a volume discount for multiple users, and also the inflexibility in pricing, as the only option is to pay annually, while other services offer a month-to-month price with an annual discount.\nI like the 30-day free trial, but keep in mind that there are a myriad of additional features available, each with a monthly cost that means with several chosen, the cost can add up quickly. These additional cost features include multilingual, multi-currency, web analytics and intelligence, and audit trail, among many others.\nOverall, I think Workbooks is a fantastic CRM platform when used for its intended purpose - providing CRM software solutions to midsize organizations.\nRead our full Workbooks review.\nBest free CRM plan\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nHubSpot is easily one of the best CRM platforms on the market, but what makes it really stand out from the crowd is its generous free plan, offering startups, entrepreneurs, and small businesses a cost-free way to roll out a CRM during their fledgling days. Simply put, it's among the best free CRM software on the market.\nFeatures\nWhile several CRM providers offer free plans, none are as functional as the one from HubSpot CRM. The basics are well covered, including contact management, call and email logs, deal pipeline, and integrations with apps, including Slack and Gmail. It even includes email scheduling and Facebook Messenger integration-features that I rarely see at this level.\nOn paid plans, the core CRM is enriched with features from HubSpot\u2019s Marketing, Sales, and Service Hubs, which then integrate nicely across these different offerings. With the marketing functionality, you can generate pop-up forms, chatbots, and ad retargeting on your website, as well as automate and track email campaigns. Premium sales features include deal assignment automation, customizable reports, and intelligent lead scoring to help focus your team\u2019s efforts.\nThe biggest obstacle is that the contacts you can market to - for example, via bulk emails or ads - are limited to 2,000 on all plans apart from Enterprise, which has a limit of 10,000. However, you can store and track up to 1 million prospects.\nPricing and plans\nWhile enviable, HubSpot\u2019s combined sales and marketing functionality comes with a steep price. Moving up from the free tier gets us to the Professional tier at a cost of $450/month. While it does support 5 users at that price, has a product library and forecasting, and supports eSignatures, that price point may be a barrier for smaller businesses. I feel it is a missed opportunity that there are no additional tiers of plans to choose from, with an appropriately lower price of entry.\nAlternatives\nHubSpot is the best option for most startups, as it offers plenty for free, but also allows you to unlock functionality as you go. However, if you are on the free plan and find yourself with questions, it can be tricky to get them answered. Workbooks offer an excellent level of support and are well worth considering as an alternative.\nSupport\nHubSpot offers a range of support options, including 24/7 phone and email support for paid plans. Their extensive knowledge base, community forums, and HubSpot Academy provide valuable self-help resources. However, the live support quality can vary.\nMy verdict\nHubSpot is an easy-to-use CRM with loads of features and integrations. The free plan is very generous and a perfect option for startups. The major downside is the big leap in paid plans, going from free to relatively expensive right away - which is something startups should be aware of when considering their future needs.\nRead our full HubSpot CRM review.\nBest CRM software for small business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFreshsales works best for small to medium businesses that prioritize ease of use over advanced customization.\nFeatures\nIts desktop and mobile interface is highly intuitive, including quick access to contact records and communications, and drag-and-drop Kanban-style boards for sales pipeline management. Its intelligent assistant tool, Freddy AI, can also help suggest which deals to close and how if you give it sufficient historical data to work with.\nIts main focus is on sales team productivity and deal closure. You can integrate your email client - including Microsoft Outlook and Gmail - into the software, enabling you to create email templates, send bulk emails to prospects, and log incoming and outgoing messages. It is also designed to integrate with other tools, including PayPal, DocuSign, Slack and Intuit QuickBooks, for a streamlined workflow.\nFurthermore, there\u2019s an in-built calling tool with a recording feature that automatically updates customer communication records. I also like that when it comes to support, there is a toll-free number, along with a direct email for getting directly in touch should the need arise for some help.\nFreshsales CRM is limited in terms of lead generation tools, such as business card scanners. It does, however, feature customizable web forms, capturing lead data from your website and automatically assigning sales leads. Other features include several thousand Bot sessions per month, depending on the plan, a visual sales pipeline, and Contact Lifestyle management.\nPricing and plans\nThere are four plans: a free tier, and three paid tiers. The free tier, while it has its limits, does still have 24/5 support, along with a mobile app. Paid tiers (Growth ($9/user/month), Pro ($39/user/mo), and Enterprise ($59/user/mo) progressively add more features up to the top Enterprise plan with a dedicated account manager, audit logs, and AI-based forecasting insights.\nAlternatives\nIf you want to generate leads with FreshBooks, you\u2019ll have to opt for a pricey enterprise-level plan. Platforms such as Zoho and HubSpot offer more out of the box in this area.\nSupport\nFreshsales provides 24/5 email and phone support, with 24/7 support available on higher-tier plans. Their knowledge base and community forums offer additional assistance. However, response times can be inconsistent, especially for lower-tier plans.\nMy verdict\nFreshsales offers small businesses all the tools they need to track and manage customer relationships. Compared to other big players like Salesforce, Freshsales is also refreshingly affordable, making it a more viable CRM for small businesses.\nRead our full Freshsales review to learn more about the sales-focused CRM; our Freshdesk review to find out about its customer engagement CRM; our Freshmarketer review to learn about the marketing CRM element; and Freshservice to discover its IT support CRM.\nBest CRM software for project management\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMonday.com is a dedicated project management system designed to give you a flexible and transparent way to organize your work.\nFeatures\nWith a highly visual scheduling interface and customizable workflows, Monday.com adapts to the unique way members of your team approach their projects. It focuses on keeping things simple and easy, offering all the features you would expect from a CRM such as email management, performance tracking, automations, data organization, and more.\nPlans and pricing\nThere are four different levels of Monday.com membership: Basic($12/user/month) , Standard ($17/user/month), Pro ($28/user/month), and Enterprise (custom pricing).\nPrices vary depending on the number of user accounts you require, with the cheapest memberships only allowing you to add two users and top-end options supporting more than 200 accounts.\nAlternatives\nMonday.com is easy to set up, but does take some time to get to grips with. If you want a CRM platform that you can get started with quickly, I suggest checking out HubSpot.\nSupport\nMonday.com offers 24/7 support via email and chat, with phone support available on higher-tier plans. Their knowledge base and community forums provide additional resources. Users generally report positive experiences with support responsiveness and quality.\nMy verdict\nMonday.com is the ideal project management tool for anyone looking for an accessible system that their team will actually use. Unfortunately, some important features, like calendar views, are only available with its more expensive subscriptions. All the same, Monday.com stands out for its slick design and adaptable third-party integrations.\nRead our full Monday.com review.\nBest CRM software for business tool integration\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nZoho is a powerhouse of business software and its CRM platform is a great option for those who already own some of the other great platforms from the company.\nFeatures\nZoho CRM does all the basics well - contact and pipeline management, communications tracking, workflow automation, and reporting. Further improving its reputation is that it is trusted by about 250,000 businesses worldwide, such as Suzuki, Bose and Purolite.\nBut its added value is in integrating with other apps from the Zoho sales, marketing, and project management suite, including Zoho Invoice and Zoho Campaigns, which can input valuable prospect data into your pipeline. Moreover, Zoho CRM can scrape contact details from social networks and scan business cards, making it a powerful lead-generation system.\nIn use, the product is highly customizable: you can add fields to contact records, create lead assignment rules, and even personalize the look and feel of your CRM interface to maximize internal usage. Reporting and analytics features are also strong, including customizable performance reports and visualization tools.\nPricing and plans\nUnfortunately, there is no free tier, but there is a free trial that can last for 15 days. While it does not require a credit card, it does need a work email and phone number, and any of the tiers can be tried.\nThe entry-level plan, known as Standard ($14/user/month), features advanced functionality with multiple currencies, advanced filters, sales forecasting, and multiple pipelines. On higher tiers, the Enterprise ($40/user/month) and Ultimate ($53/user/month) plans, you get the Zia AI feature, which recommends what leads to focus on and what emails to write, as well as how to assign workflow.\nThere is also flexibility in payment, whether month to month or alternatively for a discount, annually.\nAlternatives\nZoho focuses on integrating its CRM with its wider offering of applications. That\u2019s great if you want to use the full Zoho suite of tools, but for others, it can be limiting. Platforms such as Salesforce offer a greater range of flexibility through app marketplaces.\nSupport\nZoho provides email and phone support, with response times varying based on your plan. Their knowledge base and community forums offer additional assistance. However, some users report inconsistent support quality and slow response times for complex issues.\nMy verdict\nZoho offers a whole host of powerful business tools at reasonable prices. If you are using other Zoho tools, opting for the Zoho CRM is an easy decision to make. But even as a standalone platform, this CRM is well worth considering.\nRead our full Zoho CRM review.\nBest CRM software for user experience\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPipedrive is a cloud-based CRM tool that\u2019s younger than many on this list; it was founded in 2010. Yet, in a relatively short while, it has amassed a user base of over 100,000 businesses around the globe. The platform boasts of being \u201cdesigned by salespeople, for salespeople\u201d.\nFeatures\nPipedrive makes it easy to set up a sales pipeline for your products and services and follow up on different steps of the pipeline to close a sale. You can create the stages for your pipeline by yourself or use an existing template to make it easier. You can add deals or import them from a spreadsheet or from an external CRM into the pipeline.\nIf you\u2019re dealing with many leads, you'll like that Pipedrive lets you set automatic alerts and reminders to ensure you're on top of your deals. You can also update your sales forecast each time you progress through a deal to reflect your organization's expectation for increased sales.\nA unique thing about Pipedrive is that it incorporates artificial intelligence (AI). There\u2019s a built-in AI tool, Sales Assistant, that helps you decide what to do to close your deals and automate mundane tasks. For example, the assistant can analyze your sales actions and suggest methods to make your workflow smoother. It can track email opens and community discussions and give you activity reminders to keep you attuned to your deals.\nPricing and plans\nA major drawback of using Pipedrive is that there\u2019s no free version. However, you can take advantage of the 14-day free trial period to test its features before making your final purchase decision. Besides, Pipedrive is one of the most affordable CRM tools, starting at just $10 per user per month, compared to a rival like Salesforce which starts at $25 for the same period.\nAlternatives\nPipedrive is a great CRM but it lacks options when it comes to extra features. Opting for a platform like HubSpot or Zoho makes it easy to integrate with wider business tools such as email marketing and project management.\nSupport\nPipedrive offers 24/7 chat and email support, with phone support available on higher-tier plans. Their knowledge base and community forums provide additional resources. Users generally report positive experiences with support quality, though response times can vary.\nMy verdict\nIf you are looking for a CRM that is easy to get to grips with, Pipedrive might be the best option for you. It also plays a strong hand when it comes to pricing, offering entry-level plans at a much lower price than many competitors.\nRead our full Pipedrive CRM review.\nBest CRM for ease of use\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nZendesk Sell offers a user-friendly CRM solution ideal for small to medium businesses, with strong integration with Zendesk's customer support platform. It delivers a well-rounded CRM experience with a focus on usability and integration with Zendesk's renowned support tools.\nFeatures\nZendesk Sell provides a centralized customer database that allows users to access and update contact details, interaction history, and account-specific data. The platform offers customizable sales pipelines, enabling users to adjust stages to fit their specific sales process. I found the interface for moving deals through stages to be intuitive, making it easy to visualize progress and identify potential bottlenecks.\nThe CRM includes forecasting tools that help sales managers estimate deal volume and revenue growth. During my evaluation, I was able to generate accurate forecasts using sample historical data and current pipeline status. While these features work well, I've seen more advanced predictive analytics in other CRMs.\nZendesk Sell provides 20 pre-built charts, reports, and dashboards for insights into key sales metrics. Users can also create custom reports using a drag-and-drop interface. This functionality allows for analyzing trends by region or team and predicting revenue growth, which adds significant value for sales managers.\nI appreciated how the CRM integrates with popular communication tools. Zendesk works smoothly with email clients like Gmail and Outlook, automatically logging email communications. This integration saves time and ensures all customer interactions are captured within the CRM, offering a complete view of customer relationships.\nPricing and plans\nZendesk Sell employs a tiered pricing model with four plans tailored for various business sizes and needs. The entry-level Team plan costs $19 per user each month with annual billing. The Growth plan is priced at $55 per user per month, the Professional plan at $115 per user per month, and the Enterprise plan begins at $169 per user per month with annual billing.\nEach tier progressively adds more features, with higher plans offering advanced tools like lead and deal scoring, task automation, and advanced permissions. Zendesk offers a 15% discount for annual billing compared to monthly billing, which can lead to substantial savings for larger teams.\nAlternatives\nIf Zendesk Sell's price is a concern for your business, HubSpot offers a generous free plan that might be worth considering. For more advanced functionality, especially in terms of customization, SugarCRM could be a suitable alternative.\nSupport\nZendesk offers 24/7 support through multiple channels, including email, chat, and phone for higher-tier plans. The extensive knowledge base and community forums provide additional resources. However, the quality of support can vary depending on your plan level.\nMy verdict\nZendesk Sell is a strong and user-friendly option that balances essential features with ease of use. Its seamless integration with Zendesk's support platform makes it particularly attractive for businesses already using Zendesk for customer service.\nHowever, the pricing structure may be steep for very small businesses or startups, and some users might find certain advanced features lacking compared to more established enterprise solutions.\nBest CRM software for simple pricing\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nKeap is not your typical CRM software. Its combined set of features blurs the line between sales and marketing, with native payments, appointment booking, and email marketing functionality built on top of a core contact and pipeline management system.\nBest of all it keeps its pricing simple, which can be a relief for those looking to find a great CRM platform without all the hassle of navigating complex plans.\nFeatures\nKeap helps you convert leads through advanced marketing campaigns and save time through workflow automations and payment integration. Features include lead & Client management, sales pipeline, and analysis, text marketing, and email marketing. A straightforward interface and generous support options make Keap highly accessible even for the most novice CRM users.\nPricing and plans\nUnfortunately, Keap does not have a free tier, and while there is an offer of a free trial, it is limited to only 14 days, which is shorter than some of its competitors.\nKeap keeps it simple with pricing and totally abolishes feature-based plans. Pricing is based on the number of users and contacts you have, starting at $249/month for 2 users and up to 1500 contacts.\nAlternatives\nWith prices starting from $249/mo for two users and up to 1500 contacts, Keap certainly isn\u2019t the cheapest option on this list, making it a poor choice for most small and start-up businesses. If Keap\u2019s price is just too much, look to HubSpot for a generous free plan or Monday.com for a budget-friendly plan starting at $12/seat/mo.\nSupport\nKeap offers phone, chat, and email support, with response times varying based on your plan. Their knowledge base and community forums provide additional resources. However, some users report difficulties with account cancellation and billing issues.\nMy verdict\nWith Keap, you can get started straight away and reap benefits from email campaigns and automated triggers without a huge learning curve.\nRead our full Keap review.\nBest for manufacturing businesses\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSugarCRM offers a comprehensive, customizable platform with strong AI capabilities for sales, marketing, and customer service. It stands out with its extensive customization options, cross-functional capabilities, and AI-powered analytics.\nFeatures\nSugarCRM's centralized database allows users to access and update contact details, interaction history, and account-specific data, enabling a complete view of customer relationships. The platform offers tools for tracking and nurturing leads through various stages of the sales funnel, with customizable lead scoring.\nA visual pipeline offers representations of the sales process, allowing sales managers to quickly assess the health of their sales funnel and identify bottlenecks. I appreciated the drag-and-drop functionality, which made it easy to update the deal status.\nFor forecasting, SugarCRM uses historical data and current information to help reps fulfill their quotas. I found the AI-powered forecasting tools to be flexible, allowing users to create projections based on various criteria such as product lines, territories, or individual sales reps.\nThe system offers a wide range of pre-built reports and dashboards, covering key metrics across sales, marketing, and customer service. Users also have the ability to create custom reports and visualizations without extensive technical knowledge. I was particularly impressed by the email marketing features, which allow for personalized, targeted communications based on customer data and behavior.\nPricing and plans\nSugarCRM has three main product lines: Sugar Sell for sales teams, Sugar Serve for customer service, and Sugar Market for marketing automation. Sugar Sell, the primary CRM, begins at $49 per user monthly with 12-month billing. The base plan, Sugar Sell Essentials, targets small to medium-sized businesses and includes essential functions like contact management, basic workflow automation, and standard reporting.\nSugar Sell also presents advanced tiers: Sugar Sell Advanced at $85 per user monthly and Sugar Sell Premier at $135 per user monthly. These higher tiers add features like advanced workflow automation, improved support, and AI-powered analytics.\nAlternatives\nIf SugarCRM's complexity is a concern, you might want to consider Zendesk Sell for its user-friendly interface. For businesses looking for a more affordable option with essential features, Less Annoying CRM could be a suitable alternative.\nSupport\nSugarCRM provides a well-rounded approach to customer support, offering various channels for assistance. Support options include email, phone, and community forums. The knowledge base and documentation are extensive. However, response times can vary, and some users report inconsistent support quality.\nMy verdict\nSugarCRM is a strong and flexible CRM solution that provides a wide range of features for sales, marketing, and customer service. Its best quality is how customizable it is, which allows businesses to create an experience that fits their needs. However, some users might find the interface a bit complex, which could be a challenge for smaller organizations with limited technical expertise.\nRead our full SugarCRM review to discover more about this platform.\nBest CRM for startups\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLess Annoying CRM offers a refreshingly simple and affordable solution for small businesses. Its user-friendly interface, transparent pricing, and responsive support make it an excellent choice for those seeking essential CRM functionalities without complexity.\nFeatures\nLess Annoying CRM provides a straightforward approach to customer relationship management, emphasizing essential features without adding unnecessary complexity. The contact management interface is user-friendly, making it easy to add custom fields to meet specific business needs.\nThe platform integrates leads within its pipeline management feature, helping users track leads from initial contact to final sale, offering a visual representation of the sales process. During my testing, I found the pipeline view clear and easy to understand. However, the customization options for the pipeline are limited compared to more advanced CRM solutions.\nLess Annoying CRM also includes basic sales forecasting and reporting tools. Users can create simple reports on pipeline status and sales performance, but it lacks the advanced analytics and predictive features present in some enterprise CRMs. For small businesses and solopreneurs, this level of reporting might suffice, but those needing deeper data analysis may find it lacking.\nI liked how Less Annoying CRM handles task management and calendar integration. It sends daily email digests with upcoming tasks and events, and syncing with Google Calendar and Outlook turns the CRM into a central hub for managing customer interactions and personal schedules.\nPricing and plans\nLess Annoying CRM truly reflects its name with a clear pricing model that stands out in the complicated CRM landscape. The company offers one all-inclusive plan priced at $15 per user per month, billed monthly. This straightforward approach removes the hassle of navigating multiple tiers or understanding feature limitations.\nThe $15 plan grants full access to all features of Less Annoying CRM. This includes unlimited contacts, custom fields, pipelines, and a full suite of tools like contact management, lead tracking, task management, and reporting. There are no hidden fees; the advertised price is exactly what you pay.\nAlternatives\nIf you need more advanced features or integrations, Zendesk Sell might be a better option, though at a higher price point. For businesses looking for a more customizable solution with AI capabilities, SugarCRM could be worth considering, albeit with a steeper learning curve.\nSupport\nLess Annoying CRM is known for its strong customer support. They provide email and phone support during US Central Time business hours. Their help center is comprehensive, with detailed articles and video tutorials. All support is free, even for trial users. However, support is currently only available in English.\nMy verdict\nLess Annoying CRM lives up to its name by providing a simple and user-friendly solution designed for small businesses. Its simplicity is its strongest asset, offering essential features without the complications of larger systems. While it may not include some advanced functions typical of enterprise CRMs, Less Annoying CRM delivers core features in an easy-to-understand way.\nGive our full Less Annoying CRM review a read to learn more.\nBest CRM software for customer support\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nApptivo is a comprehensive platform for business management and collaboration, with a CRM tool included. The Apptivo CRM is famous for its simplicity and scalability, it also gets great reviews for its customer support.\nFeatures\nThe Apprivo CRM has a minimal and uncluttered interface that makes it easy to navigate. It's also very customizable; you can create your unique views, fields, and layouts to simplify your business workflow. Most of the customization occurs with a drag-and-drop workflow, which makes it easy to implement.\nThis CRM has a mobile app that enables you to manage your sales leads on the go. You can do this from anywhere with your smartphone, especially where it\u2019s uncomfortable to use your workstation, e.g., during a commute.\nApptivo has integrations with many other tools to help customers improve their workflow. For example, its integration with Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 makes it easy to send invitations to customers or potential clients outside an organization. Yet, I have observed customer complaints about Apptivo\u2019s integrations being difficult to implement and work with.\nWith this CRM, you can create and manage leads for your business with ease. You can also use the activity tracking tool to manage your routine tasks and ensure you or your colleagues don't fall behind on important tasks. You can get a detailed overview of your notes, emails, calls, scheduled meetings, follow-ups, etc. The contact management tool enables you to track all your contacts in one centralized dashboard and reach out to them when need be, and you can also do the same for your customers.\nPricing and plans\nApptivo offers four plan options, including a 'Lite' plan at $20/user/month, a 'Premium' plan at $30/user/month, a 'Unlimited' plan at $50/user/month, and an 'Enterprise' plan with bespoke pricing.\nEach tier increases limits on features such as the number of apps, custom fields per app, workflows, and custom dashboards.\nAlternatives\nGetting set up on Apptivo can be challenging and take some time. Platforms like HubSpot and Workbooks will make it easy to get set up and going quickly, making them ideal if you need to start benefiting from a CRM as soon as possible.\nSupport\nApptivo offers 24/7 support via email, chat, and phone for all paid plans. The knowledge base and community forums provide additional resources.\nMy verdict\nA major advantage of using Apptivo is that it\u2019s more than just a CRM tool. It has many other useful products for businesses, such as an email marketing tool, an invoicing and billing tool, a procurement management tool, etc. However, these tools aren\u2019t free; you\u2019ll need to pay for them in addition to your CRM bill.\nRead our full Apptivo review.\nBest CRM software for automation\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nInsightly is a great CRM system for managing complex sales pipelines, as you\u2019re able to customize contact data fields, sales funnel stages, and more.\nFeatures\nWorkflow automation, including scheduling emails when sales stages change, can save a lot of time and refocus team efforts on nurturing relationships.\nAnother strong point is its integration capabilities: contact sheets can integrate social media posts, while communications can be drawn from Mailchimp, Microsoft Outlook, and other programs.\nAlso, Insightly\u2019s reporting function can work with Microsoft Power BI to create advanced custom dashboards and reports, helping you measure and plan your sales productivity.\nThat said, lead generation features are slim: while Insightly features a mobile business card scanner, it\u2019s not able to scrape the internet for new leads. I do like the Insightly mobile smartphone apps, which integrate well with features such as mobile voice notes and the aforementioned mobile business card scanner. You don\u2019t get much hand-holding, either: Insightly\u2019s plans include only email and knowledge base support, and phone assistance has an added cost.\nPricing and plans\nThe CRM offering has three tiers, but all of them are paid, and there is no free tier. The 'Plus' plan starts at $29/user/month and comes with all the basic CRM features you would expect. Go up a tier to the 'Professional' plan at $49/user/month and you unlock additional features including workflow automations and custom page layouts. Opt for the top-level 'Enterprise' plan at $99/user/month, and you also get sandboxes and comprehensive audit logging.\nAlternatives\nInsightly doesn\u2019t offer a free plan. This can be an issue for very small and start-up businesses that need a CRM to grow, but don\u2019t have the budget for expensive platforms. Although several platforms offer free options, I suggest considering HubSpot due to its generous free plan.\nSupport\nInsightly provides email support for all users, with phone support available on higher-tier plans. Their knowledge base and community forums offer additional assistance. However, some users report slow response times and limited availability of live support options.\nMy verdict\nIn all, Insightly is a great CRM option for businesses that want to automate key business processes, saving time and money. The platform offers some affordable plans, making it accessible to businesses of all sizes.\nRead our full Insightly CRM review.\nThe best CRM software compared\nCRM software | Score | Lowest monthly fee | Free version | Key features | Support |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd | $25/per user | 30-day free trial | Sophisticated workflow automation; Enterprise app development | Email ticketing and toll-free phone | |\nWorkbooks | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | $43/per user | 30-day free trial | Coaching program, supportive onboarding | Email, phone, knowledge base |\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd | $15/per users | Free plan; 14-day free trial | Combined sales and marketing workflow; Website usage analytics | Live chat, phone, and online meeting support | |\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd | $9/per user | 21-day free trial | Deal management AI; In-built calling tool | Phone and email support, Mon\u2013Fri | |\nApptivo | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd | $20/per user | 30-day free trial | Unique bundled series of apps; customizable and scaleable | 24/7 support via email and live chat; live phone support on weekdays. |\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | $14/per user | Free plan; 15-day free trial | Lead generation through website scraping; Deal management AI | Email support, Mon\u2013Fri | |\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | $249/2-users | 14-day free trial | Unlimited email marketing | Online chat, phone, community | |\nInsightly | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | $29/per user | 14-day free trial | Database and workflow customization; Powerful reporting integrations | Email support only; Premium phone and training support costs $1500/ year |\nZendesk | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd | $19/per user | 14-day free trial | Easy to use; pre built reports | Email, chat, and phone |\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | $12/per user | Free plan; free trial | Visual project management; accessible system | Knowledge base; live chat, email, call | |\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | $15/ per user | 14-day free trial | User friendly; easy-to-use for small businesses | 24/7 email and chat | |\nSugarCRM | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | $19/per user | 7-day free trial | High levels of customization; great tools for manufacturing businesses | Email, phone, and forum |\nLess Annoying CRM | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | $15/per user | 30-day free trial | Simple pricing; super easy to use | Email and phone |\nHonorable mentions\nDuring our research for this article, we examined many more CRM platforms than those that made the short list above. Narrowing down these solutions was a difficult task and we came across plenty of CRMs that were very close to making the buying guide. As such, we felt it was only right to list a few others that, while they may not have ranked as one of the best CRMs in our eyes, and very decent solutions that are worthy of your consideration.\nNimble: Focusing on communication, Nimble CRM is especially effective if businesses want to remain in constant touch with their leads and customers - say, if social media comms is important to them. There are negatives - the support is not always the best and the email inbox isn\u2019t the easiest to organize - but overall, Nimble is a very decent CRM with an intuitive user interface and a good number of integrations.\nCreatio: No-code platform, Creatio CRM boasts a robust set of features and is split into three component software systems: Sales, Marketing, and Service. The main issue with Creatio is that if businesses want access to all three of these systems, Creatio can become prohibitively expensive. Sales Creatio alone costs $300 per user per year.\nBitrix24: A substantial toolset makes Bitrix24 an effective CRM for customer relationship management, project management, and team collaboration - regardless of business size. It\u2019s affordable, with a generous free plan, but there is a steep learning curve to navigate. Automations, for example, are complex to execute. The fact that the platform\u2019s support offering is not the best doesn\u2019t make things any easier either.\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365: A CRM from one of the tech giants, Microsoft Dynamics 365 represents a great choice if businesses already use several other products within the Microsoft ecosystem. There\u2019s also some pretty good built-in AI functionality, including ready-made email templates and real-time customer sentiment analysis. However, small businesses may find a lack of reasonable price plans and if they predominantly use non-Microsoft products, it may make more sense to look elsewhere.\nHow we tested the best CRM software\nWhen we review CRM software, we look at indicators including feature set, interface and ease of use, plans and pricing, and support options.\nA high level of automation capability in managing leads, deals, and workflow is an example feature that could contribute towards a high score. Another important strength would be a desktop and mobile interface allowing quick, intuitive access to basic features.\nWe look at pricing plans and competitors to check whether higher subscription prices are warranted by features you can\u2019t find elsewhere in the market, or whether a good deal could benefit those with lower budgets.\nGenerous customer support options are also prioritized, especially for CRM software which may come with a steep learning curve.\nYou can read our full guide to how we test CRM software at TechRadar here.\nHow to choose the best CRM for you\nWondering how to pick the best CRM for you? Here is what to look out for:\nFeatures\nThe focus of each CRM software solution varies from project management tools to marketing automation to lead generation, so look for the specs that fit your requirements.\nTake time to assess the features list and see how many will work for you and your business. Many CRM platforms offer a free plan or free trial, this can be an excellent way to really get to grips with whether a CRM offers everything you need.\nPrice\nPrice can play a major role in which CRM you choose. Research the plans on offer from the CRMs that meet your needs. Some CRMs offer a free plan, but these can be limited in what they offer. The best open source CRMs are likely to represent a good free option, but the learning curves vary.\nWhen possible, pick a plan that gives you everything you need, but not one where you are paying for features or limits that you won't use.\nAlthough you may not be using it straight away, it can also be worth assessing higher tier plans that are on offer from your CRM of choice. As you grow, knowing there are affordable plans available will save you considerable time and effort migrating to a different platform.\nIntegrations\nCRMs are all about speeding up business processes. Finding a CRM that seamlessly integrates with your other business tools, or offers integrations with tools you would benefit from, can save you considerable time and money.\nBest CRM software FAQs\nWhat is a CRM?\nIn its most basic form, a CRM helps you manage relationships with business prospects, close deals, and make your internal resources more productive.\nYou can use a CRM for cloud storage regarding data about your contacts, including names, job titles, emails, and phone numbers. It also allows you to assign and track workflow tasks to sales teams, such as sending follow-up emails, writing business proposals, and tracking invoices. Finally, a CRM platform can help you analyze and improve the effectiveness of sales and marketing activities through generating custom reports, forecasting future revenue, and anticipating sales bottlenecks.\nHow can CRM software improve customer retention?\nUsing a CRM platform isn\u2019t just about making life easier, it can also help you retain customers and drive greater profits.\nA CRM platform gives you the tools you need to track customer interactions, preferences, and purchase histories. This information is highly valuable to everyone from sales to customer service reps, helping them personalize communications, anticipate future customer needs, and address issues proactively and in a way that suits customers.\nCRMs can also support business processes with features such as automated follow ups, targeted marketing campaigns, and loyalty program management. This helps reduce friction in the buying journey, driving repeat business.\nWhy use a CRM?\nWithout a CRM solution, you\u2019d be doing significant manual work to store, track, and interact with contacts, and the sales pipeline would be more sluggish without automation or reminders.\nMany CRM solutions can integrate with software including Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Slack, Mailchimp, and business intelligence platforms, such as Microsoft Power BI.\nPopulating your CRM database with customer data from elsewhere tends to be seamless: most providers allow imports from spreadsheets or contact apps such as Google Contacts.\nWhat are the different types of CRM software?\nNot all CRMs are designed for the same purpose, so one of the first things businesses should do is determine whether they need a system focused on sales automation, data analysis, or cross-team collaboration. Broadly, the three different types of CRM fall under the categories: operational, analytical and collaborative.\nLooking into the 3 types of CRM in more detail, an operational CRM helps a company's sales, marketing, and customer service teams work more efficiently and productively. It does this by streamlining daily processes, supporting lead generation, and building the digital framework needed to ensure a great customer experience.\nAn analytical CRM, on the other hand, primarily offers tools that help businesses gather data and then transform it into actionable insights to drive growth. These insights empower sales, marketing, and service teams to make data-backed decisions about how to best serve their customers, moving beyond guesswork and relying on concrete information.\nFinally, a collaborative CRM recognizes that many deals require the hard work of multiple team members - something that is even more relevant in the age of hybrid work. These solutions break down workplace silos and improve internal and external communication. They do this by centralizing data and streamlining workflows across the entire company.\nWhat is a \"360-degree view\" of the customer, and why is it important?\nA 360-degree view essentially describes a holistic picture of the customer - something that has become more important, and yet, more difficult as the number of channels with which an individual interacts with a brand has increased. Not too long ago, businesses would primarily interact with a business face-to-face or perhaps over telephone. Then came the internet, email, social media and, suddenly, customer interactions became much more fragmented.\nHaving a 360-degree view means having all customer data - from sales interactions to support tickets and social media activity - in a single, centralized location. Miscommunication, frustration, and missed opportunities often abound when customer data from different channels remains siloed. The best CRMs don't allow this to happen.\nHow does CRM software integrate with the sales pipeline?\nHere's a quick example of how a CRM can intergrate with a sales pipeline:\nSomeone in sales could begin by scanning a prospect\u2019s business card, then create a follow-up task, log a phone call, send an email campaign, see recent social media posts, close a deal, and track the status of the project\u2014all in the same software solution. This is how CRM integrates with the sales pipeline.\nHow much does the best CRM software cost?\nCRM software is usually priced as a monthly or yearly subscription, with plans varying in feature complexity. Usually, the quoted price is per user, unless stated otherwise.\nMany vendors offer unlimited free tiers, while paid plans grow in functionality from Starter to Professional to Enterprise. Sometimes, add-ons come at an extra cost; for example, phone credits, premium support, or access to automated marketing tools.\nThe first paid tier in CRM software, which generally works well for small businesses, tends to be between $8 to $29 a month per user, charged on a yearly basis.\nMid-tier plans fit growing businesses and are priced between $20 to $75 a month. As a benchmark, Zoho CRM packs a competitive set of features in its affordable $23 monthly Professional plan.\nFinally, the Enterprise tiers tend to be on the expensive side, offering customization options and a higher level of support: the range is from $40 to $150 monthly, with HubSpot\u2019s full CRM suite reaching a whopping $4,000 a month.\nWhat are the most common challenges with CRM implementation?\nSome of the most commonly cited challenges around CRM implementation are a mixture of technological and cultural. For example, businesses may discover there is a low user adoption rate with a new CRM solution. This can occur even when businesses have chosen a first-rate solution that is ideal for their organization. A subsequent issue here is that if employees don't use the new CRM consistently, the data becomes incomplete and unreliable, rendering the solution useless. Low adoption rates may occur for several reasons, including CRM complexity, a reluctance to abandone the status quo, a lack of direct involvement from employees in the selection process, or limited or non-existent training and support.\nAnother challenge is poor data quality. As with most digital solutions, a CRM is only as good as the data it holds. If businesses have inaccurate, incomplete, or duplicate data, the CRM is likely to generate flawed outputs, leading to poor decision-making, incorrect reporting, and frustrating customer interactions.\nIntegration issues are also common with new CRM solutions. The majority of businesses today are already quite far into their digital transformation journey, meaning they are likely to have multiple software tools in place already, from email platforms to accounting software. If the new CRM system doesn't integrate seamlessly with existing systems, data silos will proliferate and employees will be forced to manually transfer information between platforms. This not only introduces inefficiency but also increases the chances of human error and data inconsistencies.\nWhat can a CRM do?\nContact / lead management\nStoring and using prospect details to nurture relationships are at the core of a CRM system. Integrations with contact apps and social media accounts are a plus, maximizing lead information for sales teams.\nDeal management\nWhen there\u2019s a sales opportunity, the deal management feature helps increase productivity so your team can close the deal. This can include setting milestones, tasks, and deadlines.\nWorkflow automation\nAutomation can get critical tasks done while saving time: for example, email templates can be scheduled to go out to prospects when they reach a certain stage in the sales funnel.\nBulk emails\nSending bulk emails to contacts can advance relationships and save sales teams a lot of time. You can usually store and personalize email templates and customize recipient groups.\nCall and email logs\nKeeping track of customer communications in a centralized CRM platform removes the need to rely on human memory and ensures teams are equipped with the latest information on the relationship.\nLead generation\nA good CRM system helps you gather new leads in a cost-efficient way. This can include inputting business card data via mobile app and scraping the internet for specific customer profiles.\nLead assignment\nIf you\u2019ve got a growing sales team, being able to assign leads to staff members is key to ensuring the best person is on the case, thus increasing the chances of closing deals.\nReporting and analytics\nCustomizing and exporting reports on your sales and marketing activities helps you learn from successful deals and focus your attention on high-likelihood prospects.\nDrag-and-drop sales pipeline\nFor manual changes to your pipeline activities, drag-and-drop Kanban-style boards are a quick and easy way to update the status of different deals.\nThird-party integration\nIntegrating with other business software increases the information you have on contacts and can add new features, such as email campaign management.\nWhat are some key features for CRM mobile apps?\nMany sales professionals are on the go, especially, as mentioned above, hybrid working is now commonplace across various industries. As such, having a CRM that is designed to work seamlessly on mobile platforms is crucial. Certain features, such as offline functionality, are also important to ensuring a seamless experience for employees working outside the office.\nWhat are some future CRM trends to be aware of?\nThe CRM landscape may be constantly evolving, but over the last few years, several key trends have emerged that are shaping the market. AI is the big one - but you could say that about any number of industries and digital tools. Given its increasing prominence, AI can no longer be viewed as a luxury for CRM platforms. Features like predictive lead scoring and automated follow-ups (as seen in Salesforce's Einstein or Zoho's Zia) are becoming standard, helping teams work smarter - not harder.\nAnother trend seen within modern CRMs is a heightened customer-centric focus. Platforms are moving beyond just sales and integrating service and marketing to provide a more holistic view of the customer journey, from first contact to post-sale support.\nIncreasing specialization is another trend in the CRM market. While generalist CRMs are popular, we're seeing more platforms tailored to specific industries, offering features unique to sectors like real estate, healthcare, or financial services.\"\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nOwain has been building websites and online stores for his own and his client's businesses for over 8 years.

Ensure you pick a platform you can afford in the long term to avoid potential troubles. Check the pricing page of your desired software and ensure you\u2019re okay with what you see. Read the fine print to see if there are any hidden costs.\nTalent management platforms usually charge a monthly or annual fee for each user. Some use custom pricing, meaning you must contact the company\u2019s sales team for a quote. Either way, ensure you pick something you can easily afford.\nEase of use\nIt\u2019s essential to pick a platform that\u2019s easy to use and navigate. A platform with an intuitive interface will make things easier both for the HR department and the employees they\u2019re managing. Badly-designed software can frustrate users, especially non-technical ones, and cause people to make costly mistakes.\nCustomer support\nThings can go wrong at any time, and you\u2019ll need external help to sort out the issue. You should be able to contact a human support representative for help when things go wrong. The platform should also offer complementary support resources such as user guides, how-to articles, video tutorials, and extensive documentation. Check user reviews to see if the platform is being commended for offering excellent customer support.\nFeatures of talent management software\n1. Applicant tracking and recruiting\nThe platform should enable you to create job postings and get feedback. You should be able to communicate with people who responded to your organization\u2019s job postings across different channels. The platform should keep job candidates informed on their progress throughout the hiring process and help you deliver valuable feedback.\n2. Compensation management\nThe system should let you manage pay, expenses, pay adjustments, bonuses, stocks, and other forms of compensation for employees. It should let you create compensation plans for different levels of employees and guidelines for increasing the compensation when needed.\n3. Mobile app\nThese days, any platform without a mobile app is missing out. Almost everyone has a smartphone and likes to work with it on the go. Your talent management system should have a mobile app that lets HR staff and employees make some changes from anywhere as long they have an internet connection.\n4. Performance management\nYour platform should enable you to monitor employee performance and productivity. It should have tools for performance reviews and give you insights into all employees' productivity to help you identify who needs to put in more effort or not.\nHow we tested the best talent management software\nWhere possible, we sign up for every talent management software product that we review.

      "text": "Best productivity tool of 2025\nHave teams work better\nWe list the best productivity tools, to make it simple and easy to have your teams work more effectively and efficiently.\nProductivity tools do this not just by focusing on simplifying routine tasks, but also by making collaboration and project management much easier for teams. This is especially useful so that no matter where any individual is, they can remain in contact with the rest of their team and provide the latest updates and information that everyone needs.\nProductivity tools also include essential management features, to prioritize schedules and work to deadlines, such as for time management and task management. The also interface needs to be simple and easy to use so that managers do not become bogged down in administrating it all. Additionally, everything needs to be presented in a clear way so that contact management information is easy to find and action.\nThere are also other tools that can help improve productivity and efficiency, simply by making complex tasks simpler and easier to do. This could be anything from managing backups to social media monitoring, or the best CRM software.\nBelow we list what we think are the best productivity apps currently available.\nYour Complete Productivity Suite. Email, Docs, Meetings, and AI in One Place. Upgrade to Google Workspace and save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nThe best productivity tool of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest productivity tool overall\nReasons to buy\nMicrosoft Office is probably the platform most people think of first when it comes to office productivity suites, with the cloud-based Microsoft 365 being the latest incarnation.\nWhat ensured that MS Office became a market leader is the comprehensive way data can be covered by different applications and moved between them, making working more efficient and hassle-free. With Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Outlook forming the core programs, these cover everything from documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and emails - in effect covering most essential office needs. In addition to that, OneDrive offers online saving and backups to keep your files safe.\nWhile there are alternatives to MS Office, most rivals attempt to play catch-up with Microsoft rather than provide innovative new features, and MS Office still remains the office suite with the most comprehensive range of features. And even if you do use one of these alternatives, the chances are you are going to be working with document formats created specifically for MS Office, and handle data from customers and suppliers who are using the MS Office platform.\nWhile MS Office does have its critics, the bottom line is that nobody does office productivity better than Microsoft, and the core applications in Office have yet to be bettered.\nThe yearly Personal plan costs around $70 / \u00a365 / AU$105 and includes up to 1 TB of cloud storage per user for up to 5 devices.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nBest productivity tool for collaboration\nReasons to buy\nAsana has been around since 2008, making it a veteran in the collaboration arena, and companies such as Intel, Uber, Pinterest and TED all use it as their core method of communication.\nIt\u2019s been designed as an easy way for companies to track the work of employees and to get the best possible results.

Team members can also assign comments to posts within the app.\nYou can organize all your projects in a list or board format, and there\u2019s a search function so you can locate past work quickly. In short, Asana is a very effective way to stay super-organized and facilitate conversations when it comes to updates on how work is progressing.\nThere are three paid tiers: Premium (priced at around $9 / \u00a310 / AU$15 per user per month when billed annually), Business (costing around $20 / \u00a321 / AU$30 per user per month on a yearly basis) and Enterprise. Premium tracks team projects and includes many extra features such as advanced searches, a workflow builder and custom fields. The Business plan offers everything in Premium plus added resources such as portfolios, advanced reporting and time tracking.\nRead our full Asana review.\nBest productivity tool for versatility\nReasons to buy\nTrello is a smartly designed and popular service for managing, organizing and sharing everything from simple to-dos to major project management tasks.\nGetting started is as easy as dragging cards onto a Trello board. Cards can represent single tasks, with priorities and deadlines attached. But they can also be more substantial checklists, with attached files and pictures, containing hyperlinks to point somewhere else.\nAnd there's a whole library of Power-Ups, custom cards which allow you to integrate a host of third-party services into your workflow: Box, Evernote, GIPHY, GitHub, Hangouts, Join.me, Mailchimp, OneDrive, Salesforce, Slack, SmartDraw, SurveyMonkey, Twitter, ZenDesk and more.\nTrello has plenty of collaboration tools to help you manage your projects, and a stack of ingenious features to ensure it's user-friendly. Just one example: the Cloud Aging power-up visibly ages cards if they've not been accessed for a while, fading them out, maybe turning them yellow and even cracking. This isn't just a visual gimmick \u2013 it allows users to instantly see underused cards on even the busiest of boards, a real timesaver.\nRead our full Trello review.\nBest productivity tool for features\nReasons to buy\nBitrix24 provides a vast suite of powerful business tools: collaboration, instant messaging, telephony, project management, document handling, scheduling, employee management, and more.\nIf you prefer to keep things simple then you can concentrate on the excellent CRM, which is a capable system all on its own. Contacts and communications are logged, leads assigned to sales managers, emails sent, calls recorded, quotes and invoices issued. Detailed reports keep you up-to-date and there's convenient access via the mobile app.\nBitrix24's unusually generous free account supports 12 users and includes 5GB storage, but if you need more, the Plus account offers more features.\nOverall, Bitrix24 is offers a powerful suite of tools that is especially going to be handy for small businesses and start-ups to help them develop and grow through improved productivity, all in one platform.\nRead our full Bitrix24 review.\nBest free productivity app\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTodoist straddles the categories of time management tools and to-do lists, with an element of project management thrown in for good measure. Despite touching on multiple genres, the tool remains easy to use, making it possible to manage multiple project with ease, and see at a glance what you still have to do.\nThe website or app gives you a daily and weekly overview of what work you have to do, what appointment you have, or whatever else you choose to track. If you're working with a group of people and find that your workload is getting a little heavy, you can delegate tasks to others.\nThe free version limits you to working with five people and having 80 active projects on the go at any one time, and this should be more than enough for most people, but Premium and Business plans are available for a fee. Todoist offers integration with dozens of apps and services so it can tie in neatly to your existing workflow.\nRead our full Todoist review.\n2. RescueTime\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRescueTime not only tracks the time you spend doing different things on your computer or mobile \u2013 such as visiting particular websites or using specific apps \u2013 it does so automatically. Running in the background as it does, RescueTime quietly logs your activity without serving as a distraction.\nIt's possible to set yourself targets and alerts, and the idea is that these goals will help you to develop better working habits. It enables you to see just how you spend your day on your digital devices so you can better understand where the time has gone. There free version of the app enables you to look back at three months of data for analysis, but paid-for packages (which start at $6 per month) have no limits and includes a number of extra features.\nFor most people, the free version will be more than enough, and the fact that it is available for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android and ChromeOS means that it is possible to track work across multiple devices and platforms.\n3. Beeminder\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBeeminder is quite a unique tool that can be used to track and monitor everything from running or trips to the gym, to logging how often you write, or managing a to-do list. Available as an app, or usable online, Beeminder is endlessly flexible \u2013 you define your goal (whatever that may be) and you are tasked with logging your progress. There is a degree of gamification to things here; you're aiming to stick to the 'yellow brick road', which means that, at least on average, you are hitting your targets.\nAnything that can be plotted on a graph can be tracked \u2013 number of words written, number of hours worked, number of contracts signed \u2013 and sticking within the golden zone can be hugely incentivizing. If you're willing to commit fully, you can add your credit card details to your account so you can be fined for failing to stay on track. Beeminder is not for everyone one, but it is so unique, it is well worth giving it a try to see if it works for you.\n4. Toggl\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nToggl is described by its developers as \u2018insanely simple time tracking\u2019, and that's a pretty fair summary. If you take a look at the website, it is the premium versions of the service that are pushed, but there is a free version suitable for teams of up to five people.\nToggl is available for multiple platforms and synchronization means that you can move between devices and stick track your work. There's a lot to explore here, including manual and automated track of activity, a Pomodoro timer, automatic detection of idle time, reminders, integrations with various apps and services and much, much more.\nThe beauty of Toggl, however, is that it is so flexible and customizable. What ever you're looking to monitor, you can probably bend it to your will. The detailed reports are impressive, but it's a bit of shame to see that there is no invoicing option in an otherwise feature-packed tool.\n5. Clockify\nReasons to buy\nClockify grabs the idea of clocking on and off for a shift and runs with it. It is a very simple tool, but that's precisely what will make it so appealing to people \u2013 after all, if you're busy with work, you don't to be overwhelmed with a complex tool for tracking what you're doing!\nClockify is essentially a basic stopwatch so you can easily record how long you spend working on different project. Just start the timers, and you can add labels, descriptions and project details, and just hit stop when you're done. You can configure timers to start as soon as you open your browser so you don't need to remember to do so.\nClockify integrates with Trello, Asana, Jira, Todoist and more, and you can use the website and apps to view details reports and breakdown of how you have spent your time. If you would like to keep Clockify available at all times without the need to dedicate a browser tab to it, you'll be pleased to hear that there is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that keep it just a click away. There are also mobile apps, and desktop versions for macOS, Windows and Linux.\nBest productivity tool FAQs\nWhich productivity tool is best for you?\nWhen deciding which productivity tool to download and use, first consider what your actual needs are, as sometimes free platforms may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a paid platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, free and budget software options can sometimes prove limited when it comes to the variety of tools available, while higher-end software can really cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require.\nHow we tested the best productivity tools\nTo test for the best productivity tools we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each software platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

These range from Usable Security to a Cybersecurity Capstone Project, so it\u2019s safe to say that they'll require you to already have some intermediate cybersecurity know-how under your belt.\nThere are additional cybersecurity courses available, though, covering everything from the basics to more advanced specializations.\nThere are also online degrees available in either computing and IT or data science, although none are focused specifically on cybersecurity, you can be assured that cybersecurity will be a significant part of the curriculum.\nOverall, Coursera isn't so well-presented as Future Learn, but there are potentially more accredited options for study through it.\nRead our full Coursera learning platform review.\nBest budget online cybersecurity course\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTypically, courses on Udemy cost money, but we\u2019ve found a few worth checking out that won\u2019t put a dent in your bank account.\nThe \"Cyber Security Course for Beginners - Level 01\" could also be advantageous to take, not only for cybersecurity enthusiasts but for anyone who want to learn more about the subject. This particular course offers free video content, but you will not receive a Certificate of completion, instructor Q&A or direct messages.\nHowever, Udemy's real selling point is that not only does it offer some very in-depth courses, many of these courses are extremely cost-effective.\nPaid courses worth looking for for include \"Cyber Security Crash Course for Beginners: Learn From Scratch\" but there are also others to consider such as \"The Data Science Course 2020: Complete Data Science Bootcamp\" which will help provide an insight into the intricacies of computer science.\nIt's worth underlining just how comprehensive and intensive the paid courses can be, and while they may not carry any traditional educational accreditation they could be excellent options if you wanted to consider working as a freelancer to build up some experience, and in a very cost-effective way, too.\nRead our full Udemy learning platform review.\nBest short online cybersecurity courses\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFuture Learn offers a wide range of short and free online sources, with the opportunity to pay for certificates of participation either at the course level or else access all content for a set fee. The courses themselves are well-presented in short and easy to work sections that make learning simple and interesting.\nThe \"Introduction to Cyber Security\" offers a free taster to the subject, and is accredited by UK Government intelligence organization GCHQ, global accreditation and examination institute APMG International, and The Institute of Information Security Professionals. However, there are also a small number of accredited degrees available in IT and computer science which includes a masters degree in cybersecurity.\nOverall, while Future Learn is more focused on general introductory short courses, there are paid-for and accredited learning opportunities available through the platform.\nRead our full FutureLearn learning platform review.\nBest military-grade online cybersecurity course\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNexGenT was created by two US Air Force veterans with extensive experience teaching and training network engineering and cybersecurity.\nThe cybersecurity track features two courses: Basic Training, which serves as a prerequisite, and Cyber Security Specialization. Experienced candidates, however, can skip Basic Training by taking a series of tests to prove their skills.\nBasic Training prepares you for both Full-Stack Network Associate (FSNA) and Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certificates. No prior experience is necessary, and the course is self-paced, so you can start and finish at any time.\nThe \"Cyber Security Specialization\" training course takes place over 22 weeks, covers everything you need to know to protect businesses from cyberthreats, and includes access to NexGenT\u2019s Career Services, which helps students enter the workforce upon completion.\nThe base tuition for the Cyber Security Specialization Program is costly up front at $10,500, or you can choose zero-fee tuition and pay 10% of your salary only once you have a job with a $40,000 salary. After seven years, all remaining debt is forgiven, even if you haven\u2019t paid a cent. That\u2019s how confident NexGenT is that you\u2019ll find a job and earn a living. (Although, the zero-fee tuition option seems not to be available at the moment)\nThat confidence is backed up with some impressive figures: more than 50,000 enrolled students, 460,000 classes taught, and a number of success stories attesting to the effectiveness of their training.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a solid and structured way to enter the professional world of cybersecurity, this may be the right course for you.\nFor more information, read our full NexGenT review.\nBest accredited online cybersecurity course\n5. Open University\nReasons to buy\nThe UK's Open University (OU) is a leader when it comes to distance learning, having spent decades developing its courses, and it serves an international range of students. The online portal for students is excellent with information clearly laid-out, with different modules having clear timetables to work to.\nEven better is that the courses are tailored toward people of all abilities, and do a fantastic job of easing the inexperienced and unqualified into what can be quite deep and advanced topics, while actively trying to prevent students from feeling overwhelmed.\nThe OU offers a dedicated online degree in cybersecurity, as part of its wide range of flexible Computing and IT honors degree courses, where you can choose to focus in different areas, all of which will show a concern for security issues. The OU also offers a dedicated degree in Data Science.\nFor the full 3 year course, the cost is around $21,500.\nThe big advantage of the OU is that it can deliver an accredited degree in computing internationally, and aims to embrace all learners while allowing them to define their own learning path. Additionally, you can take up to 16 years to qualify for your degree through part-time learning.\nBest free online cybersecurity courses\nBest extensive online cybersecurity course\n1. Cybrary\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAs the name suggests, Cybrary is an online library for cybersecurity, IT and other InfoSec-related study materials. After creating a free account, you get access to almost 500 courses, each ranked by their difficulty and all of them free.\nYou can filter classes by level \u2013 Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced \u2013 or by vendors like Cisco, (ISC)2 and Microsoft. Whether you want to learn the fundamentals of malware or the art of the Jedi mind trick, both of those curriculums are given equal prominence in Cybrary\u2019s extensive course catalog.\nWhat is especially good about Cybrary's courses is that they tend to focus on specific aspects of IT, which means if there are areas you'd prefer to specialize in then you can focus on that rather than have to take a larger course to access it.\nBest government online cybersecurity course\n2. CISA\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCISA (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency) is part of the US Department of Homeland Security, and is an obvious source of cybersecurity expertise.\nHowever, you may not have been aware that you don\u2019t have to travel all the way to the United States to benefit from the vast experience of US government security experts, or that you can do so for free.\nThe DHS has a calendar full of training events you can attend in Idaho Falls, but for everyone who doesn\u2019t live in the midwestern US there\u2019s an entire portal of online courses available to those involved in the security of industrial control systems.\nBest general online cybersecurity course\n3. Open Security Training\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIts website looks like what you'd get if you took all the slideshows and teaching materials from a university cybersecurity department and uploaded them to a domain sporting the most minimalist user interface of all time, but Open Security Training is host to a range of intermediate and advanced classes, along with a swath of beginner lessons that any newbie would be a fool to pass up.\nThere\u2019s a whole rundown on the x86 and x64 architectures wielded by Intel processors, along with introductions to topics along the lines of cellular security, network forensics and vulnerability assessment.\nBest online cybersecurity course for beginners\n4. Heimdal Security\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFrom the same firm that brought you The Daily Security tip comes Heimdal Security\u2019s Cyber Security Course for Beginners. Although this, too, is email-based, its syllabus is significantly more extensive than that of The Daily Security Tip.\nThe Cyber Security Course for Beginners delivers a new lesson every two days for five weeks, and all without the need to pay back any tuition loans. In terms of content, it aims to give you step-by-step advice for keeping your personal data out of nefarious hands.\nBest basic online cybersecurity course\n5. Sans Cyber Aces Online\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIt\u2019s undeniably basic, and yet SANS Cyber Aces provides a nice little introduction to online IT and cyber security that's easy to follow and understand.\nAfter reading through a series of comprehensive entries about operating systems, networking and system administration, you can register for a quiz that puts your expertise to the test. Should highlighted talking points such as installing Linux virtual machine software or basic PHP, Bash and PowerShell web scripting pique your interest, you\u2019ll be in for an engaging lecture.\nWe've also featured the best password manager.\nBest online cybersecurity course FAQs\nWhich online cybersecurity courses is best for you?\nWhen deciding which of the best online cybersecurity courses to use, first consider what level of competency you are currently at. If you've not learned cybersecurity before then it would definitely be recommended to start with the beginner courses, as these will break you into the basics you'll need before you cover more advanced tools. However, if you already have a decent amount of experience with cybersecurity then feel free to try your hand with the more advanced courses.\nHow we tested the best online cybersecurity course\nTo test for the best online cybersecurity courses we searched for a range of popular options as well as took recommendations from people we know who are learning cybersecurity or who are already competent with it. Then we followed the tutorials to get an idea of how easy they were to follow, how easy it was to learn essential tools and processes, and additionally what sort of user level the courses were aimed at, such as beginner, medium, or advanced-level users.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

Cost\nCost is the first thing to consider when choosing any product. Ensure you choose something that you can afford in the long term. PIM tools are known for being expensive; the final pricing depends on what features you choose and how many people use the product. Hence, you should be sure of what you\u2019re choosing before making any payment. Always check if there\u2019s a free trial to test the platform\u2019s features.\n2. Ease of use\nYour PIM tool should be easy to use, especially for non-technical users within your organization. The platform should have an intuitive interface that\u2019s easy to use and navigate. Users should be able to switch between different features easily, and it\u2019s preferable that the platform has a mobile app.\n3. Customer support\nThings can go wrong at anytime with your software, and you\u2019ll need external help to rectify the issues. Ensure you choose a platform with a good reputation for customer support. You should be able to contact a human support representative when things go wrong. You should also have access to complimentary support resources such as video tutorials, FAQs, user guides, etc.\n4. Security\nYour PIM platform should be as secure as possible to avoid sensitive product details leaking before time. It should have advanced encryption and two-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized account access.\nEssential features of a product information management software\nData importation\nYou should be able to import data from other platforms into the PIM system you're using. For example, you can upload a spreadsheet from Microsoft Excel for technical specifications or Word documents to provide information to customers.\nBulk editing\nYou should be able to edit product information on multiple channels simultaneously. Otherwise, you'll have to edit information separately on each channel, which takes considerable time and effort. Bulk editing is a way of editing complex tasks.\nCatalog management\nYou should be able to create catalogs of your products and define pricing parameters for each one. You can show these catalogs to customers to give them a good overview of your product.\nDigital asset management\nYour PIM solution should be able to manage digital media such as photos, videos, infographics, content, etc., in a central repository. This makes it easy to create content to describe your products, which, in turn, improves your conversion rate.\nCollaboration\nMultiple people across different organizations should be able to collaborate to create compelling product details. Any PIM tool that doesn\u2019t foster collaboration puts your business at a disadvantage.\nHow we tested the best product information management software\nWe test the best product information management software by evaluating numerous factors.

So instead of repackaging PR blurbs and feature checklists, I decided to actually try them.\nThis guide is the result of hundreds of hours spent signing up, testing features, running real workflows, and figuring out which AI tools actually help get work done, across every major use case I could think of.\nI went deep into each tool, from image generation to email automation, chatbot building to scheduling assistants.

He's been following the AI space closely for over five years, ever since the early days of GPT-2, giving him a solid perspective on how these tools have evolved. Alongside writing, he helps with editorial work to keep content updated and useful. Outside of work, you'll find him playing basketball or heading off on solo trips.\nBest AI chatbots\n1. Chat GPT\n- What is it: A fast, multimodal AI assistant from OpenAI that can understand and respond using text, images, audio, and even video.\n- Ideal for: Anyone who needs a flexible AI to help with writing, research, coding, image generation, file analysis, or even live conversations.\nI\u2019ve used ChatGPT for everything from writing blog drafts to debugging code and summarizing PDFs, and honestly, it\u2019s only getting better. The newest version, GPT-4o, is seriously fast and can now handle not just text but also images, audio, and videos (with Sora). It\u2019s like having a researcher, writer, translator, and creative partner all in one tab.\nThe voice capabilities of ChatGPT are only getting better with each passing day. You can have real-time conversations with ChatGPT using natural speech, and it actually responds with tone, pauses, and emotion. If you\u2019ve used earlier versions, the leap in responsiveness and clarity is obvious.\n\u2705You want an AI that can handle many tasks in one place: ChatGPT is great for writing, research, brainstorming, and file analysis without needing separate apps.\n\u2705You value customization and memory: With saved instructions and session memory, it gets better the more you use it.\n\u2705You need fast, natural-sounding voice interactions: GPT-4o\u2019s voice mode feels surprisingly human, ideal for hands-free workflows or accessibility use.\n\u274cYou rely on live, verifiable sources: While ChatGPT is improving, its browsing still isn\u2019t as integrated or reliable as Google\u2019s.\n\u274cYou want seamless collaboration with real-time documents: It doesn\u2019t sync directly with tools like Docs, Sheets, or shared calendars.\n\u274cYou prefer a visually guided interface: Most interactions are still chat-based, and there\u2019s no dashboard or modular layout for managing outputs.\nStill, my favourite update this year from ChatGPT is how the o-series models (like o3 and o4-mini) are starting to behave like real agentic assistants. They can decide when to use tools like web search, file readers, or DALL\u00b7E image generation on their own.\nIf you use it regularly, you also get smart memory and deeper personalization. It remembers your preferences, writing style, and past interactions, which makes back-and-forth workflows much smoother over time.\nI keep using it for more clarity and understanding, and it\u2019s fabulous how it remembers my past inputs. Here, you can see how it tells me about my previous doctor visits and the related details.\nChatGPT\u2019s free plan now includes access to GPT-4o with basic limits, which is more than enough for casual use. The ChatGPT Plus plan is $20/month, and it offers higher usage caps and faster access to new features (like image generation and longer memory). Team and Enterprise plans unlock more tools for collaborative and business use.\nBest All-in-One AI Assistant for Everyday Use\nChatGPT has matured from a simple text generator into a full-featured multimodal assistant that handles everything from writing and brainstorming to coding, file analysis, and visuals. With its consistent rollout of features and intuitive UI, it remains one of the most accessible tools in the AI space. Try GPT-4o for free or upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month to unlock more tools, memory, and better performance.\n2. Google Gemini\n- What is it: A multimodal AI chatbot by Google that works across text, images, code, and voice, with deep integration into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more.\n- Ideal for: People who use Google Workspace daily and want an AI that can help plan, write, organize, and multitask across their personal ecosystem.\nGemini has quietly become one of the smartest AI assistants out there, especially after the release of Gemini 2.5 Pro. I\u2019ve used it to pull data from Sheets, draft emails from long threads, and even clean up messy trip itineraries in Docs. It feels like a real assistant that knows where everything is.\n\u2705You\u2019re already embedded in Google\u2019s ecosystem: Gemini works best with access to your Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and other apps.\n\u2705You want a multimodal AI for visual + voice tasks: Its power to analyze images, respond to voice, and interact with media is a major strength.\n\u2705You care about fact-checking and accuracy: Gemini\u2019s auto-verification with Search makes it better for tasks that require up-to-date, factual info.\n\u274cYou need a tool for freeform creativity: Gemini can feel stiff when writing fiction, dialogue, or creative copy.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not comfortable sharing personal data: The AI\u2019s personalization relies heavily on your Google activity and history.\n\u274cYou expect full control over the assistant\u2019s behavior: Unlike ChatGPT, you can\u2019t deeply customize tone, response style, or role behavior yet.\nGemini's native integration with Google products, like Gmail, Calendar, and Photos, is probably the biggest reason it\u2019s a popular tool among the masses. You can ask it to summarize documents, draft replies, create tasks, and analyze photos. It also verifies answers with Google Search, which greatly reduces hallucinations.\nThat said, Gemini isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s incredible for structured tasks, but when I used it for open-ended brainstorming, it felt a bit flat compared to ChatGPT. Creativity and tone control still lag. Also, the personalization can be hit or miss, like it remembers your activity, but sometimes leans too heavily on past searches.\nYou can try Gemini for free, but Gemini Advanced ($20/month) gives you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, 1M token context windows, and all the deep integrations. If you already live inside Google Workspace, it\u2019s an easy upgrade.\nGoogle Gemini \u2013 Best AI Assistant for Google Workspace Users\nIf your digital life revolves around Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Calendar, Gemini is the AI you want in your corner. Built with native integration across Google Workspace and powered by the Gemini 2.5 model, it\u2019s designed to reduce busywork and surface insights across your files and tools. From summarizing documents to organizing your day, Gemini blends into your existing routines without extra setup. Enroll for Gemini Advanced absolutely free for the first month.\n3. Grok AI\n- What is it: An AI chatbot by AI focused on advanced reasoning, real-time search, and productivity, built into X (formerly Twitter) and now available across platforms.\n- Ideal for: Power users and developers who want deep reasoning, real-time search, and a flexible coding or document creation workspace.\nI picked Grok AI over Claude and Perplexity because it\u2019s evolving fast and is more than just a chatbot now. While Claude has a clean tone and Perplexity excels at retrieval, Grok 3 felt more capable when thinking through complex prompts, especially in math, logic, and scientific tasks. That alone made it worth exploring deeper.\n\u2705You want an AI with advanced reasoning: Grok 3\u2019s \u201cThink\u201d and \u201cBig Brain\u201d modes outperform most chatbots for logic-heavy, scientific, or technical tasks.\n\u2705You\u2019re a developer or power user: Grok Studio is great for perfect for coding, testing, and writing in one AI-assisted workspace.\n\u2705You want real-time summaries from the web: Its DeeperSearch feature taps into live web and X (Twitter) content, making it ideal for staying current.\n\u274cYou prefer polished UX and structured output: Grok\u2019s interface and tone still feel rough compared to Gemini or ChatGPT.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not on X or don\u2019t want to be: Full access requires an X Premium+ subscription, which may be a dealbreaker for those avoiding the platform.\n\u274cYou want advanced multimodal features now: While Grok has vision and voice features, they\u2019re newer and not as refined or widely integrated yet.\nIt comes with a canvas where I can write and test code or work on documents with AI help in real time. It's perfect for tasks where you want the AI to assist without bouncing between tabs.\nIt also has a built-in Deep/Deeper Search tool that pulls live data from the web and X, which is pretty powerful when summarizing trending topics with context. But it does take some time. My query, \u201cWhy is gold value soaring?\u201d took almost three minutes to process.\nNot to forget, Grok\u2019s UX can sometimes feel clunky, especially compared to Gemini or ChatGPT. Its tone occasionally leans too casual or offbeat. And while vision and memory features are improving, they\u2019re not as refined just yet.\nGrok is free on X, but the SuperGrok subscription provides full access, including Grok 3, Studio, Vision, and multilingual voice support. If you're technical or already active on X, it\u2019s surprisingly powerful.\nGrok AI \u2013 Best Reasoning-Based AI Assistant for Power Users\nGrok is built for people who want more thinking and less fluff. Whether you\u2019re analyzing complex ideas, coding in real time, or digging into breaking topics, Grok 3\u2019s deep reasoning and live web search help you move faster. Its integration with X and tools like Grok Studio gives it an edge for developers and tech-savvy users. Try the free version today.\nBest AI image generators\n1. Google Imagen\n- What is it: A text-to-image generator by Google that produces highly detailed, fast-rendering images across a wide range of styles and languages.\n- Ideal for: Designers, marketers, and creative teams who want photorealistic or stylized visuals with precise control over prompts and edits.\nWhen it comes to image quality and prompt accuracy, Google Imagen 3 is one of the strongest models I\u2019ve tested. I picked it over tools like Midjourney or DALL\u00b7E for two things: control and speed. Imagen gets the little things right, be it the textures, color gradients, and most importantly, prompt comprehension.\n\u2705You want extremely high-quality visuals from detailed prompts: Imagen 3\u2019s precision and realism are top-tier.\n\u2705You work in multiple languages or need fast iteration: It's efficient, multilingual, and great for creative prototyping.\n\u2705You want flexible image editing: Its step-by-step editing system saves time and frustration during revision.\n\u274cYou need full creative freedom without restrictions: Access is gated, and public availability is still catching up.\n\u274cYou want stylized, experimental results: other tools like Midjourney or Runway often deliver more artistic unpredictability.\nI gave it a prompt to \"Create an image of a mouse teaching rocket science to a class full of humans,\" and the result was pretty accurate. But as I\u2019m someone who never feels satisfied with an AI\u2019s first response, I decided to make it more lifelike.\nThe prompt was \u201cmake it more realistic,\u201d and the result is below.\nThis is exactly where it truly stands out, i.e., refining the images even better. You can edit elements step by step, which speeds up creative workflows massively. It\u2019s also noticeably fast, around 40% quicker than its previous version and supports multi-language prompts, which are super useful when testing in non-English scenarios.\nThe realism is impressive, though it leans more toward clean, polished outputs than artistic styles. It\u2019s not for pixel-level control or style blending like Midjourney, but for fast, good-looking visuals within a familiar setup, it nails the job.\nGoogle Imagen \u2013 Best AI Image Generator for Fast, Accurate Results\nImagen 3 strikes a strong balance between speed and fidelity, making it a go-to for design teams and marketers who want great visuals without spending hours tweaking prompts. With improved language understanding, better text rendering, and faster generation, Imagen is ready for creative production at scale. You can test it through ImageFX for free, or access premium tools and API integration via Google Vertex AI.\n2. ChatGPT 4o Images\n- What is it: A multimodal AI model by OpenAI that can generate, understand, and refine images based on natural language prompts, built into the broader ChatGPT 4o experience.\n- Ideal for: Creators and marketers who want to generate high-quality, stylized images while staying inside a flexible AI assistant that also handles writing, code, audio, and more.\nYou probably don\u2019t think of ChatGPT as an image generator but you should now. With the rollout of GPT-4o, OpenAI quietly upgraded its DALL\u00b7E 3 integration, and it\u2019s surprisingly capable. I\u2019ve been using it when I want visuals that tie directly into the text I\u2019m working on, whether it\u2019s for a pitch deck, a social post, or just testing visual concepts while writing copy.\nThe big win here is context. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re working on a product idea. You can describe the branding, voice, and features, and then say, \u201cNow create a realistic product shot based on everything we\u2019ve discussed\u201d.\n\u2705You want an AI that can generate and refine images in context, especially alongside your writing or research.\n\u2705You value ease of iteration: Edits like \u201cmake it sunset\u201d or \u201cadd more trees\u201d are just a prompt away.\n\u2705You\u2019re already using ChatGPT for content and want light design tools built in.\n\u274cYou want cinematic or surreal results: Other tools like Midjourney still outperform it in artistic complexity.\n\u274cYou don\u2019t plan to pay: image generation is locked behind the ChatGPT Plus paywall if you want a lot of images at once.\nAnd it actually does it, pulling context from the conversation so far. That kind of continuity is hard to beat.\nIt\u2019s also now easier to refine images using natural language. You can click \u201cEdit\u201d on a generated image and just describe the changes like \u201cmake it night-time\u201d or \u201cadd a streetlamp in the background.\u201d This makes iterative creation feel more like a conversation than a design tool.\nThat said, output quality still leans clean and literal. It\u2019s not as visually wild as Runway. Also, you can\u2019t adjust parameters like aspect ratio or style weight yet, which limits granular control.\nYou can use image generation features in ChatGPT for free. However, you can only generate 2-3 images. To get more, subscribe to ChatGPT\u2019s Plus plan for $20/ month.\nChatGPT 4o (Images) \u2013 Best Image Generator for Content + Visuals in One Flow\nIf you already use ChatGPT to write, code, or brainstorm, image generation is now built right in, so no need to switch apps. ChatGPT 4o\u2019s image generation (powered by DALL\u00b7E 3) works best when paired with longer conversations, giving you context-aware visuals with just a few clicks. It\u2019s simple, fast, and surprisingly smart for marketing assets, social creatives, and mockups. Free users can try a few images, but for full access, upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month.\n3. Adobe Firelfy\n- What is it: Adobe\u2019s AI-powered image generator designed for commercial use, with deep integration across Photoshop, Illustrator, and other Creative Cloud tools.\n- Ideal for: Designers, agencies, and content teams who need AI-generated visuals that are safe for commercial use and easy to edit inside Adobe apps.\nAdobe Firefly isn\u2019t the flashiest image generator but it\u2019s hands-down the most practical for professional creatives. I use it when I need visuals that won\u2019t raise legal eyebrows or when I want a smoother pipeline into tools like Photoshop or Express. Everything you generate is trained on licensed and rights-cleared content, so it\u2019s built from the ground up with commercial usage in mind.\n\u2705 You want AI visuals that are safe for commercial use: No copyright gray areas.\n\u2705 You already use Photoshop or Illustrator and want AI to speed up mockups or edits.\n\u2705 You care about editable layers and tight integration with your design workflow.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for highly stylized or abstract art: Firefly sticks to safe, polished outputs.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Creative Cloud tools: Standalone use feels limited by comparison.\n\u274c You want unlimited generation for free: Credits run out fast on the free plan.\nThe real magic happens after generation. You can push Firefly outputs straight into Photoshop and tweak layers, masks, or elements without needing to start from scratch. If you\u2019ve ever tried editing a Midjourney image in Photoshop, you\u2019ll know how big of a time-saver this is.\nI especially like the Generative Fill tool. You can erase part of a photo and tell Firefly what to replace it with, something like \u201cadd clouds here\u201d or \u201creplace this background with an office,\u201d and it fits in perfectly. It\u2019s clean, quick, and feels native to the editing experience.\nWhere it lags a bit is imagination. Firefly tends to stay within safe, brand-friendly boundaries. Don\u2019t expect surreal lighting or stylized chaos here as it\u2019s built for clean outputs, not experimental art.\nFirefly is available for free with limited credits, but to unlock faster rendering and full resolution downloads, you\u2019ll need a Creative Cloud plan, which starts at $19.99/month for individuals.\nAdobe Firefly \u2013 Best AI Visual Tool for Designers & Agencies\nFirefly is Adobe\u2019s answer to AI-powered content creation, but what makes it stand out is its seamless integration with the entire Creative Cloud suite. Whether editing in Photoshop, generating concepts in Illustrator, or refining brand visuals, Firefly gives you AI-generated assets that are ready to use in your workflow and safe for commercial projects. It\u2019s built for speed, collaboration, and compliance. You can try Firefly as part of the Creative Cloud All Apps plan, perfect for teams and creators working at scale.\nBest AI website builders\n1. Wix\n- What is it: Wix is one of the best website builders that uses AI to generate complete site layouts, content blocks, and branding elements.\n- Ideal for: Solo creators, freelancers, and small businesses who want a professional-looking site without hiring a developer.\nWix is one of the most established website builders out there, and its AI integrations make the setup process even faster. You just describe the kind of site you want, like business, portfolio, online store, and Wix creates a draft with layout, copy, images, and even a logo if you need it.\nWhile testing, its AI builder took only a few prompts and quickly generated a full website draft, complete with layout, text sections, colors, and a basic logo. The results really came down to how well I described the site\u2019s purpose and style. That means if your prompts are clear, the AI builder delivers something surprisingly useful.\n\u2705 You want a working site in minutes: Wix AI delivers full-page layouts and content within a few prompts.\n\u2705 You prefer editing with visuals, not code: The drag-and-drop interface gives you full design flexibility.\n\u2705 You want built-in tools beyond design: From payments to SEO to client bookings, Wix includes essential features for your online store and more.\n\u274cYou want total creative control from the start: The AI template might feel too structured for pixel-perfect custom design.\n\u274cYou need backend access or custom apps: Wix isn\u2019t built for advanced logic or server-side development.\nImportantly, the first draft came together pretty quickly, with relevant text sections and smart layout decisions I could immediately tweak. I then used the AI Text Generator to rewrite my homepage bio and dragged in a new image section, which the AI resized automatically. But if you don\u2019t like any of it, you can simply start over with a fresh layout instantly.\nNow, even though the initial layout setup took a moment, editing everything after that was simple. I renamed pages, swapped in new images, and adjusted sections without needing any design software.\nOutside the editor, Wix covers most of what you\u2019d need to run a website, like payments, bookings, email marketing, SEO tools, and even basics like logo creation and color presets. I like how it\u2019s all built in, so you\u2019re not constantly jumping between different apps just to get set up.\nBest AI Website Builder for Creative Control Without Code\nWix combines fast site generation with one of the most flexible editors out there. You can start with a few prompts, adjust layouts, rewrite content, and even rework your branding. Wix also comes with built-in tools for payments, SEO, bookings, and email campaigns, enough to run a small business without adding anything extra. The free plan is available with AI tools and templates. Premium plans start at \u00a317/month with a custom domain and eCommerce options.\n2. Hostinger\n- What is it: Hostinger is one of the best web hosting and website builder providers. It offers AI-generated sites, performance hosting, and beginner-friendly design features.\n- Ideal for: Beginners and solo creators who want a fast, affordable, and clean website without coding.\nHostinger\u2019s AI website builder takes a refreshingly minimal approach. You describe your idea in a few lines, like what the site is about, your preferred tone, color preferences, and the AI instantly turns that into a fully structured website. Layouts come prefilled with relevant text, images, and pages, often ready in under a minute. It\u2019s built for speed but leaves room for control, especially when you need to refine the details of the site.\nOnce the demo site was ready, I used its drag-and-drop editor to tweak the layout. Moving sections, changing colors, swapping images, and adjusting fonts felt easy to manage. There were 14 core elements to work with, including contact forms, image galleries, adding social icons, and a library of prebuilt sections for things like policies or service blocks. In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t overly flexible, but it offered enough control to get the site looking close to what I had in mind without much extra effort.\n\u2705 You want a website instantly from a sentence: Hostinger generates usable layouts and content in under a minute.\n\u2705 You\u2019re new to web design: No-code editor, auto backups, and mobile editing make the platform beginner-friendly.\n\u2705 You want extra AI tools bundled in: From SEO and blog writing to logos and product pages, Hostinger includes an entire toolkit.\n\u274c You need a very niche or complex layout: The first AI version may feel too basic unless your prompt is specific.\n\u274c You want long-term pricing consistency: Renewal costs rise significantly after the initial term.\nHonestly, Hostinger has a versatile ecosystem of AI tools. You get an AI writer, blog generator, SEO assistant, logo maker, and even a heatmap tool that predicts what people will click on.\nFor online stores, it helps generate product descriptions and email campaigns. The toolkit even includes a page generator that builds new layouts from a single sentence.\nHere, some pages may feel a bit generic if your input is vague, and you\u2019ll still need to do some editing, but overall, Hostinger strikes a smart balance between automation and manual control. It\u2019s fast, friendly, and a great pick for anyone starting from zero.\nBest AI Website Builder for Speed and Simplicity\nHostinger lets you launch a polished site in under a minute. Its AI builder creates a ready-to-edit layout from just one sentence, while extras like an AI writer, SEO assistant, and image generator help you fill out your content. It\u2019s fast, beginner-friendly, and comes bundled with hosting, email, and eCommerce tools. Grab a 75% discount on Hostinger\u2019s Premium Website Builder plan on a four-year term at just $2.99/mo.\n3. GoDaddy\n- What is it: GoDaddy is a business-first website platform that combines AI site building, e-commerce, and branded marketing tools.\n- Ideal for: Entrepreneurs and small business owners who want built-in tools for branding and sales.\nGoDaddy is best known as a domain provider for years, but it now offers a full-blown website builder that helps small businesses go from buying a domain to launching a complete site instantly.\nIts AI-powered website builder is equally good and a great starting point for a non-technical person. Under this, you just answer a few questions about your business and what you're trying to do. It then builds a complete website tailored to your category, whether it's photography, wellness, real estate, or something else.\nAnd since the layout comes with ready-made sections and prefilled text, you don\u2019t have to build webpages manually. It works well for local businesses or solo projects that need something clean and functional without getting stuck in design details.\n\u2705 You want a business site that markets itself: From captions to logos and emails, GoDaddy\u2019s AI helps drive engagement.\n\u2705 You\u2019re starting from scratch: Templates, themes, and automatic layout blocks guide you step by step.\n\u274c You want advanced design freedom: Customization is there, but more limited compared to open-ended builders.\nThe editor strikes a balance between AI support and hands-on control. You can experiment with new themes, switch colors, tweak fonts, and reposition layout blocks. There\u2019s also an AI logo maker and \u201cCreate with AI\u201d section that lets you generate everything from logos to social posts and captions. Even if you need a \u201cbook now\u201d button or gallery, simply describe what you need, and GoDaddy adds it automatically.\nGoDaddy puts just as much focus on marketing as it does on site design. You can generate social captions with AI, track email performance, and drop in eCommerce features like PayPal buttons without much setup. Even the free plan lets you accept payments. Plus, the social tools feel built-in rather than bolted on, with things like Google Photos access and quick caption prompts that actually make posting easier.\nWhile the single-page limit on the free plan might feel restrictive, it\u2019s a great starting point. GoDaddy also provides 24/7 support with an AI help assistant, which makes it super easy to get answers on the fly.\nBest AI Website Builder for Small Business and E-commerce Launches\nGoDaddy\u2019s AI Website Builder is both easy to use and powerful enough. Built-in features cover everything from appointment booking and email marketing to social posts and eCommerce setup. It\u2019s especially helpful if you want to launch quickly and keep everything under one roof. You can get started with the Basic Website Building plan at just $9.99/ month (41% discount) if you opt for the yearly package.\nBest AI virtual assistants\n1. Apple Siri\n- What is it: Siri is Apple\u2019s built-in voice assistant, now powered by Apple Intelligence, which delivers smarter, more contextual help across iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches.\n- Ideal for: Apple users who want voice-driven assistance for everyday tasks, smart control, and system-wide context.\nEver since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone, Apple has set the standard for tech innovation. So it\u2019s no surprise that the launch of Apple Intelligence is turning heads.\nWhether it\u2019s powering the latest iPhones, Macs, or even the ever-familiar voice assistant Siri, Apple is aiming to make everyday tasks feel effortless with intelligence that\u2019s context-aware, private, and seamlessly baked into your devices.\nClearly, Siri has moved well beyond timers and quick texts now. With the arrival of Apple Intelligence, you can now think of Siri as a real assistant. For example, if you change your mind mid-way while giving a command like \u201cSet an alarm. Wait, make that a 15-minute timer,\u201d Siri will understand it instantly.\nLast week, I asked it to send a file, and even without naming the app or saying the full contact name, it figured out exactly what I meant.\n\u2705 You work within the Apple ecosystem: Siri works across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, HomePod, and Apple Watch without extra setup.\n\u2705 You want privacy-first assistance: Most requests are processed on-device without leaving your hardware.\n\u2705 You need native voice control for daily tasks: From messages to timers to smart home scenes, Siri handles it all.\n\u274c You use mostly non-Apple products: Siri\u2019s strengths are deeply tied to Apple hardware and software.\n\u274c You rely on web-based productivity: It doesn\u2019t match Google Assistant or ChatGPT for open-ended queries yet.\nMoreover, Siri saw what was on the screen, understood the context, and handled the task without needing more input. This intuitiveness stays constant whether you\u2019re sending a message, playing music, or finding directions; it just works.\nSiri can connect to ChatGPT (with permission) to summarize documents, write creative pieces, or analyze photos, all without swiping screens or changing apps. You can ask it to explain system settings, draft an email, or pull up information from other apps, and it handles the request smoothly.\nBut I still see a lot of room for improvement here. Like, to test the most advanced features, having newer iPhones with iOS 18 or later is mandatory.\nAnd while Siri works beautifully within Apple\u2019s ecosystem, it\u2019s less effective for tasks that require external web tools or extensive automation.\nThat being said, with Apple devices, Siri now feels like a built-in sidekick. It picks up on your habits and quietly gets better, all without giving up your privacy.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Apple Users\nWith the rollout of Apple Intelligence, Siri has become significantly smarter. It can now understand on-screen context, follow up on previous commands, and even tap into ChatGPT when it needs extra help. Whether you\u2019re scheduling a meeting, sending a quick message, or just asking how to screen record, Siri blends seamlessly into your routine. It\u2019s available for free on all supported Apple devices running iOS 18 and above.\n2. Google Assistant\n- What is it: Google\u2019s longtime voice-powered assistant for Android and smart devices, now transitioning to Gemini for more advanced, AI-driven help.\n- Ideal for: Android users who want voice-based assistance for everyday tasks, real-time answers, and device-wide control.\nGoogle Assistant works across phones, tablets, smart speakers, and even in-car systems, so it\u2019s always within reach when you need it.\nWhether you\u2019re in the kitchen, driving, or just relaxing on the couch, you can use it to get things done without picking up your device.\nDuring testing, I asked it to check the weather, play music on a speaker, and add smoothie ingredients to my list. Commands like \u201cCall Dad\u201d and \u201cRemind me to drink water\u201d responded instantly.\nI even started a workout with Nike Run Club using just my voice. Notably, the Voice Match feature recognized who was speaking and kept responses personal on shared devices.\n\u2705 You rely on Google apps daily: Assistant connects natively with Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and Android settings.\n\u2705 You want effortless, real-time responses: Commands for reminders, timers, media, or location info are fast and hands-free.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to relearn your assistant later: With Gemini taking over, sticking with Assistant now might just delay the switch.\nNow, Google is beginning to move away from Assistant and introduce Gemini, its next-generation virtual assistant powered by generative AI. This is a much smarter, more conversational experience that understands context better and works more seamlessly with apps. The transition is already underway on many new Android phones and will continue throughout the year.\nGemini builds on what Assistant already did well but adds a few new tricks. It can generate images, summarize documents, translate in real time, and offer more fluid conversations across devices.\nYou can still use Google Assistant on many devices, and it continues to handle everyday tasks and Google app integrations reliably.\nBut Gemini is where Google is heading. It brings more intelligence, flexibility, and awareness to your phone, home, and even your car.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Everyday Google Tasks\nGoogle Assistant still helps you manage your day with hands-free commands across Android phones, smart speakers, and other connected devices. It works directly with Gmail, Maps, Calendar, and smart home tools, making it easy to check reminders, get directions, or control your lights with just your voice. It continues to run reliably on millions of devices worldwide and remains free to use on Android phones and Google smart devices through 2025.\n3. Amazon Alexa\n- What is it: Amazon\u2019s voice assistant built into Echo devices and now evolving into Alexa Plus, a more conversational AI powered by generative technology.\n- Ideal for: Smart home users and Amazon shoppers who want hands-free control, productivity features, and built-in entertainment across devices.\nAlexa has grown from being a voice-controlled speaker into a full-fledged home assistant, and with the arrival of Alexa+, powered by generative AI, Alexa remembers more, responds with more personality, and handles tasks independently across apps and services.\nOn my Echo device, Alexa handles my reminders, helps me control smart lights with voice prompts, plays music, and even gives delivery updates without a hitch. With Alexa+, it feels more like talking to someone than giving commands.\nNow, it can pick up on incomplete questions, remember preferences like dietary needs, and even follow through on multi-step tasks, like finding a plumber and booking a visit.\n\u2705 You use Alexa for your smart home devices: Alexa+ improves everything from device control to alerts and media playback.\n\u2705 You\u2019re already a Prime member: Alexa+ is free for Prime users and available across Echo devices and mobile apps.\n\u274c You need AI for work or productivity workflows: Alexa+ is still more home- and lifestyle-focused than business-oriented.\nSmart home control feels smoother now. I could move music or video across devices and get Ring alerts when a package arrived, all without picking up my phone.\nYou can upload photos, event flyers, or even study material, and Alexa+ can summarize them or turn them into To-Dos or flashcards. It remembers key dates, routines, and even personal notes like family recipes or gift ideas.\nAlexa Plus is rolling out in phases, starting with Echo Show users, and is included free with a Prime membership.\nIf you just want the Alexa+ subscription, it costs $19.99/ month right now. It\u2019s built for what Amazon calls ambient intelligence, something that\u2019s always available, constantly learning, and ready to help whether you\u2019re on a speaker, phone, or browser.\nWhile the full rollout is still underway, Alexa Plus already feels like a smarter, more capable version of the original.\nBest AI virtual assistant for smart homes and everyday tasks\nA smarter upgrade to Amazon\u2019s voice assistant, Alexa+, uses generative AI to handle complex requests. It remembers your preferences and acts across apps and devices without additional prompts. It\u2019s built into Echo speakers and displays, with proactive alerts, personalized routines, and smart home control that works even across rooms. It comes included for free with Amazon Prime, or is available for $19.99/month excl. Early access rolling out to Echo Show users in the U.S.\nBest AI Notes Apps\n1. Jaime\n- What is it: An AI note-taker that records and summarizes meetings without using bots.\n- Ideal for: Founders, managers, sales teams, or recruiters who need instant, structured summaries of meetings\nAI note-taking tools handle tasks like reviewing meetings, creating summaries, or managing action items. Jamie does all of this automatically, so you can stay focused on the conversation.\nI tested Jamie in both virtual and in-person meetings. The clean interface kept distractions away, with no bots, popups, or glitches interrupting the experience.\nJust one click to \u201cstart meeting,\u201d and Jamie ran in the background. In under ten minutes post-call, Jamie dropped a polished transcript with key takeaways and action items, all neatly tagged by the speaker.\n\u2705 You want accurate meeting notes without bots: Jamie records privately in the background, no pop-ins or distractions.\n\u2705 You need summaries and transcripts fast: You get the full output in 10 minutes with tasks, decisions, and speakers tagged.\n\u2705 You care about privacy and compliance: Jamie is GDPR-compliant, and your data never gets used for AI training.\n\u274c You need live transcription: On the downside, Jamie only processes recordings after meetings end.\n\u274c You rely heavily on mobile: Jamie is currently desktop-only with no mobile app.\nYou\u2019ll also find a built-in assistant. Simply hit Command+J and the AI will help you draft emails, search meeting history, or brainstorm ideas.\nOn a call with a Spanish-speaking client, Jamie handled both languages without any glitches or wrong understandings. I also added terms like \u201cSDK rollout\u201d to the custom word list, and they came through clearly in the summary. It helped keep the transcription accurate, even when the discussion got more technical.\nThere\u2019s no real-time transcription or mobile app yet, and you\u2019ll need to manually share notes or copy content into tools like Slack.\nWhile there aren\u2019t any major bugs, the exporting options are limited. Even some users on G2 have reported issues with older conversations or audio sync.\nThat said, the summaries themselves are reliable, bot-free, and feel especially useful if you value privacy or want a clean, distraction-free way to keep track of meetings.\nBest bot-free AI notes app for private, accurate meeting summaries\nJamie captures meetings quietly in the background, transcribes them with high accuracy, and highlights tasks and key takeaways, without any bots or browser extensions. Its AI assistant helps with writing follow-ups, searching across meetings, or drafting ideas post-call. The free plan includes 10 meetings/month. Opt for their paid plans, which begin at \u20ac24/user/month with longer meetings, priority support, and more AI usage.\n2. Fireflies.ai\n- What is it: An AI meeting assistant that joins calls, records conversations, and turns them into searchable transcripts and summaries.\n- Ideal for: Teams that host regular meetings and want searchable records, auto-summaries, or integrations with CRM and project tools.\nTo see if it really works, I used Fireflies on a mix of team calls and one-on-ones. It handled speaker identification surprisingly well and got the meeting structure right almost every time.\nWhen the call ended, the summary showed up in my inbox. It was neatly organized by topic with time-stamped highlights.\nFireflies automatically joins your Zoom, Meet, or Teams calls, records the conversation, and transcribes it with solid accuracy. No reminders or setup needed.\nAfter the meeting, it delivers AI-generated summaries with action items, key highlights, and organized sections like \u201cPricing\u201d or \u201cNext Steps,\u201d so you can skip the note-taking and stay focused.\n\u2705 You want detailed, time-stamped meeting recaps: Fireflies breaks down calls into labeled sections with summaries, questions, and next steps.\n\u2705 You use apps like Slack, Notion, or Salesforce: Fireflies has direct integrations with over 60 tools for easy sharing.\n\u2705 You manage a global team: With support for 100+ languages and speaker ID, it\u2019s built for multilingual meetings.\n\u274c You need complete accuracy out of the box: Some AI summaries need edits if the call includes crosstalk or poor audio.\n\u274c You\u2019re only looking for mobile or in-person note capture: The mobile app exists, but it is more limited than the desktop experience.\nThe Fireflies Chrome extension is pretty useful for those who connect on Google Meet often. It adds a live transcript sidebar during your calls, so you can follow along in real time. And you don\u2019t need to invite the bot, just join the meeting, and Fireflies will capture everything from your browser.\nFireflies\u2019 AskFred made it easy for me to find what you needed. For example, when I asked \u201cWhat did Alex say about onboarding?\u201d and it pulled the exact response from the notes. This means you don\u2019t need to scroll through the whole transcript for a simple answer.\nIf your team relies on tools like Slack, Notion, or Google Docs, Fireflies\u2019 integrations are a real plus.\nYou can send notes to a shared Slack channel or clip soundbites into Notion to follow up later. Fireflies works quietly in the background, surfaces what matters, and saves you time after every call.\nBest AI notes app for teams that need transcripts, not just summaries\nFireflies turn every call into searchable notes, summaries, and insights, which is perfect for busy teams.

Let\u2019s say you have a transcript from a writing workshop you attended. You can ask Notion to summarize something like \u201cThe importance of search intent while writing a blog.\u201d It doesn\u2019t just search keywords.

Whereas, Professional Voice Cloning, requires at least 30 minutes of audio to produce an identical replica of the original voice. This advanced cloning supports all available languages and accents, which makes it perfect for professional-grade applications\nNonetheless, ElevenLabs comes with a few shortcomings as well. First, the software's fancy features might be tricky for beginners. This could be a problem for new teams who want to finish their work quickly.

It\u2019s important to note that Google Translate's strength lies in its extensive language support, as it provides translations for over 100 languages. On top of that, the translator also seamlessly integrates with Google products like Chrome and Google Docs. This makes it convenient for you to access translations while working on different projects and sites.\nAgain, even for informal purposes, Google Translate is a big show. It is super helpful for talking to people from different countries, sharing funny memes, or figuring out what foreign songs or movies are all about. It's like a language bridge for both casual and formal conversations.\nSimilarly, if you want to make your conversations easier, the voice-to-text function in the software lets you speak and have it translated. It not only provides translations but also perceives the sound. Additionally, Google Translate displays the part of speech when translating a single word and suggests other possible variations.\nAlthough Google Translate is very useful, it does have a few limitations we must throw light on. Sometimes, it has trouble with idiomatic expressions, which can make the translations sound strange. Meanwhile, at times, the accuracy of complex sentences can also be inconsistent. This is more of a concern since translations are confusing at times. Furthermore, there are worries regarding the privacy policies of Google Translate due to the fact that the translated material is stored and utilized for training purposes.\n2.

This feature is commonly used for remote interpretation services and lets the interpreters provide live translations. Plus, for educational purposes, Microsoft Translator offers inclusivity through live captioning and cross-language understanding which brings a more engaging learning environment for students and parents alike. It also handles domain-specific terms through custom models, which improve its utility in specialized fields.\nOverall it features a user-friendly interface, like text-to-speech and speech translation features. With all this, you can translate text instantly or in batches, and it even supports a wide range of formats, from simple text to complex documents. Plus, its integration with other Microsoft products, such as Outlook and Word further improves its accessibility and convenience for everyday use.\n4.

It stands out because of its advanced neural network technology through which it delivers translations that are not just precise but also capture the subtle details of the original text.\nWe love that DeepL pays close attention to the small details that make languages unique. This makes it the top pick for experts and regular people who want accurate translations. DeepL can understand phrases that have special meanings or certain linguistic values, which helps the translations sound natural and real in the language they're being translated into.\nOne of the standout features of DeepL is its ability to translate entire documents while retaining their original formatting. Users can upload PDF, Word (.docx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files which makes it particularly useful for business and academic settings where maintaining the integrity of the document's layout is crucial.\nDeepL also offers a glossary and dictionary feature, which allows users to add specific terminology to ensure translations are accurate and consistent with industry jargon. On top of that, DeepL deals with 32 languages, including a variety of European and some Asian languages.\nFor those looking to refine their writing, DeepL offers the DeepL Write Beta, which helps fix grammar and punctuation mistakes, rephrase sentences, and adjust the tone of the text. This feature is great for professionals who need to produce polished, high-quality written content.\nWhen it comes to performance, DeepL is often compared to other major translation services like Google Translate, Systran, Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate. While Google Translate supports more languages, DeepL is frequently praised for its higher accuracy, particularly for European languages.\nBest AI music generators\n1.
