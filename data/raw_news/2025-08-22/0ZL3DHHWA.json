  "title": "OpenAI announces New Delhi office as it expands footprint in India",
  "description": "OpenAI has started hiring in India as it looks to expand its presence in the fast-growing South Asian tech market.",
  "content": "OpenAI has announced plans to open its first office in India, just days after launching a ChatGPT plan tailored for Indian users, as it looks to tap into the country\u2019s rapidly growing AI market.\n\nOn Friday, the company said it would set up a local team in India and open a corporate office in the capital, New Delhi, in the coming months. The move builds on OpenAI\u2019s recent hiring efforts in the region. In April 2024, the company appointed former Truecaller and Meta executive Pragya Mishra as its public policy and partnerships lead in India. OpenAI also brought on former Twitter India head Rishi Jaitly as a senior advisor to help facilitate discussions with the Indian government on AI policy.\n\nIndia \u2014 the world\u2019s second-largest internet and smartphone market after China \u2014 is a natural fit for OpenAI, which is competing with tech giants like Google and Meta, as well as AI upstarts like Perplexity, all looking to tap into the country\u2019s massive user base.\n\nThe company said that it has started hiring a local team to \u201cfocus on strengthening relationships with local partners, governments, businesses, developers, and academic institutions.\u201d It plans to get feedback from Indian users to make its products relevant for the local audience and even build features and tools specifically for the country.\n\n\u201cOpening our first office and building a local team is an important first step in our commitment to make advanced AI more accessible across the country and to build AI for India, and with India,\u201d said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, in a statement.\n\nOpenAI also announced it would host its first Education Summit in India this month and its first Developer Day in the country later this year.\n\nWhile India is clearly an essential market for OpenAI, the company faces key challenges \u2014 including how to convert free users into paying subscribers. Like other major AI players, it must navigate the monetization hurdle in a price-sensitive South Asian market.\n\nEarlier this week, the company introduced its sub-$5 ChatGPT plan called ChatGPT Go, priced at \u20b9399 per month (approximately $4.75), making it the first ChatGPT plan in India to attract the masses. This came just days after arch-rival Perplexity partnered with Indian telco giant Bharti Airtel to give Airtel\u2019s more than 360 million subscribers access to Perplexity Pro for 12 months.\n\nOpenAI also faces challenges in integrating with Indian businesses. In November, Indian news agency Asian News International (ANI) sued OpenAI for allegedly using its copyrighted news content without permission. A group of Indian publishers joined that case in January.\n\nNonetheless, the Indian government is actively promoting AI across its departments and aims to strengthen the country\u2019s position on the global AI map \u2014 momentum that OpenAI hopes to leverage.\n\n\u201cIndia has all the ingredients to become a global AI leader \u2014 amazing tech talent, a world-class developer ecosystem, and strong government support through the IndiaAI Mission,\u201d Altman said.\n\nIndia is not OpenAI\u2019s first Asian office location. The company previously opened offices in markets including Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. OpenAI rival Anthropic also considered Japan a higher-priority market than India in the continent and recently set up its office in Tokyo rather than New Delhi.\n\nOne of the reasons these AI companies do not prioritize India as an early market is the difficulty in securing enterprise customers, a Silicon Valley-based investor source recently told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cOpenAI\u2019s decision to establish a presence in India reflects the country\u2019s growing leadership in digital innovation and AI adoption,\u201d said Indian IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, in a prepared statement. \u201cAs part of the IndiaAI Mission, we are building the ecosystem for trusted and inclusive AI, and we welcome OpenAI\u2019s partnership in advancing this vision to ensure the benefits of AI reach every citizen.\u201d",

      "text": "OpenAI said in a post on X that it is opening new offices in multiple cities, including NYC, Seattle, Paris, Brussels, and Singapore, in addition to its existing locations in San Francisco, London, Dublin and Tokyo, as part of the company\u2019s global expansion efforts.\nThe expansion effort follows the San Francisco-based ChatGPT maker\u2019s whopping $6.6 billion funding round, a restructuring plan announcement, and a series of executive departures.\nThe company also said managing director Oliver Jay (formerly the chief revenue officer at Asana and head of APAC and LATAM at Dropbox) will oversee international operations and facilitate global expansion from Singapore.\nA spokesperson at OpenAI told TechCrunch the company has started building a team in Singapore, which will serve as a hub to support customers and partners in the Asia Pacific region. The company is currently hiring engineers, and plans to open the Singapore office at the end of this year. This will be OpenAI\u2019s second office in Asia, following the launch of the Tokyo office in April.\n\u201cSingaporeans are some of the highest per capita users of ChatGPT worldwide, with the number of weekly active users in Singapore doubling since the beginning of the year,\u201d OpenAI said in a statement.\nAlongside the new office, OpenAI said it is partnering with AI Singapore to expand access to its AI technology in Southeast Asia. AI Singapore, initiated in 2017 by the National Research Foundation (NRF), is a national program that supports Singaporean companies and research organizations in leveraging AI.\n\u201cSingapore, with its rich history of technology leadership, has emerged as a leader in artificial intelligence, recognizing its potential to solve some of society\u2019s hardest problems and advance economic prosperity,\u201d said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI in its statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with the government and the country\u2019s thriving AI ecosystem as we expand into the APAC region.\u201d"

      "text": "OpenAI today launched a new, cheaper ChatGPT paid subscription plan in India called ChatGPT GO, priced at \u20b9399 per month ($4.60), which is more affordable than the \u20b91,999 (about $23) per month Plus Plan.\nThe company had turned on local currency pricing for all its plans a few days ago, and with this launch, it will also allow users to pay through UPI (Unified Payments Interface), India\u2019s payment framework.\nNick Turley, VP at OpenAI and head of ChatGPT, said that this plan will increase the message, image generation, and file uploads by 10x over the free tier. The ChatGPT Go plan will also enable better memory retention for more personalized responses, Turley said.\n\u201cMaking ChatGPT more affordable has been a key ask from users! We\u2019re rolling out Go in India first and will learn from feedback before expanding to other countries,\u201d Turley said.\nFrom a currency-conversion standpoint, the Plus plan was higher than $20 for Indian users when offered in local currency. The new Go plan offers a more affordable alternative to people who are looking to use ChatGPT primarily for chat, image generation, and file processing.\nTibor Blaho, a software engineer with a reputation for accurately leaking upcoming AI products, had previously teased this plan and its details.\nWhile OpenAI is geo-restricting this plan to India, the company said on its support page that it is working to expand this plan to more regions.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nLast month, Turley noted that ChatGPT now has more than 700 million weekly users worldwide \u2014 up from 500 million in March. OpenAI launched its updated image-generator feature for ChatGPT in March, and since then, it has seen an uptick in usage in India. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a recent podcast that India is the company\u2019s second biggest market. With the Go plan, it wants to cash in on that.\nAccording to app analytics firm Appfigures, India has been the leading country in terms of ChatGPT app downloads across platforms, with over 29 million downloads coming from the country in the last 90 days. However, the app only made $3.6 million in this period from users in the country.\nThis move will likely nudge more consumers to subscribe to use ChatGPT more, given its pricing. Other AI companies have also made moves to attract users from the country\u2019s internet user base of over 850 million. Last month, Perplexity partnered with network provider Airtel to offer free Perplexity Pro subscriptions. Google also dished up a free AI Pro plan for India-based students for one year.\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s move is not giving out any freebies, local and affordable pricing will likely result in a better subscription conversion rate for ChatGPT in India."

      "text": "One of India\u2019s largest news agencies, Asian News International (ANI), has sued OpenAI in a case that could set a precedent for how AI companies use copyrighted news content in the world\u2019s most populous nation.\nAsian News International filed a 287-page lawsuit in the Delhi High Court on Monday, alleging the AI company illegally used its content to train its AI models and generated false information attributed to the news agency. The case marks the first time an Indian media organization has taken legal action against OpenAI over copyright claims.\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Justice Amit Bansal issued a summons to OpenAI after the company confirmed it had already ensured that ChatGPT wasn\u2019t accessing ANI\u2019s website. The bench said that it was not inclined to grant an injunction order on Tuesday, as the case required a detailed hearing for being a \u201ccomplex issue.\u201d\nThe next hearing is scheduled to be held in January.\n\u201cWe take great care in our products and design process to support news organizations,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement. \u201cWe are actively engaged in constructive partnerships and conversations with many news organizations around the world, including India, to explore opportunities, listen to feedback, and work collaboratively.\u201d\nThe lawsuit adds to mounting global pressure on AI companies over their use of copyrighted material. OpenAI currently faces over a dozen similar lawsuits in the U.S., two in Canada, and one in Germany, according to statements made in court.\nOpenAI\u2019s counsel Amit Sibal defended the company\u2019s practices, arguing that copyright laws don\u2019t protect facts and that ChatGPT allows websites to opt out of data collection. The Microsoft-backed firm has no servers in India and maintains that the suit lacks jurisdiction, he added.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

      "text": "OpenAI is working with former Twitter India head Rishi Jaitly as a senior advisor to facilitate talks with the government about AI policy, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. OpenAI is also looking to set up a local team in India.\nPeople familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Jaitly has been helping OpenAI navigate the Indian policy and regulatory landscape.\nOpenAI currently does not have an official presence in India (apart from a trademark, approved earlier this month). However, OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman visited New Delhi during his world tour in June and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. After his meeting, Altman said he had a great conversation with Modi. Nevertheless, neither Altman nor the company made any announcements during his two-day visit.\nIt\u2019s not clear if Jaitly is formally employed at OpenAI, but he\u2019s been taking on a role advising the company on how to establish connections in India. He started in the role sometime after Altman\u2019s New Delhi visit, two sources told TechCrunch.\nBetween 2007 and 2009, Jaitly served as head of the public-private partnership for Google in India before moving to Twitter (now called X) in 2012. He was the company\u2019s first employee in the country, according to his LinkedIn profile.\nHe was later elevated to VP for the APAC and MENA region. In late 2016, Jaitly left Twitter and became the co-founder and CEO of Times Bridge, the global investment arm of the Indian media giant The Times Group. Times Bridge\u2019s portfolio includes Uber, Airbnb, Coursera, Mubi, Smule and Wattpad. Jaitly left the firm in 2022.\nOpenAI and Jaitly did not respond to requests for comment.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nOpenAI\u2019s vice president of global affairs, Anna Makanju, is scheduled to speak at the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence summit in Delhi next week, alongside other industry experts and international politicians. She will be a part of the session titled \u201cCollaborative AI for Global Partnership (CAIGP) \u2013 Global Cooperation for Equitable AI.\u201d Sources told TechCrunch that Jaitly assisted in setting up Makanju\u2019s participation at the event.\nIn recent weeks, OpenAI\u2019s leadership has been on a roller coaster. First, Altman and board president Greg Brockman were abruptly ousted from the company. The duo joined Microsoft for a hot minute before returning to OpenAI with a revamped board.\nAt an event hosted by Times Group in New Delhi during his June visit, Altman responded to a question about building foundational models with a $10 million budget. It\u2019s \u201chopeless,\u201d he said. (OpenAI has raised a bit more itself \u2014 over $11 billion to date \u2014 to build its foundational models.)\nHis comments met some backlash from Indian entrepreneurs, but Altman clarified later that his words were taken out of context and that he meant it\u2019s hard to compete with the likes of OpenAI with such a budget.\n\u201cThe right question is what a startup can do that\u2019s never been done before, that will contribute a new thing to the world. I have no doubt Indian startups can and will do that,\u201d he said in a post on X.\nthis is really taken out of context! the question was about competing with us with $10 million, which i really do think is not going to work. but i still said try! however, i think it\u2019s the wrong question.\n\u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) June 10, 2023\nCritics have described India as severely lagging behind in the world of AI development, not least because of the lack of funding. This piece in September noted that India\u2019s AI startups have raised around $4 billion, which sounds like a big number until you consider the $50 billion that has been poured into the ecosystem in India\u2019s great rival, China; or the $11 billion+ that OpenAI alone has raised (along with the billions more picked up by other large players, and of course the money Big Tech is putting into this).\nA more sympathetic viewpoint might be that India\u2019s AI development is still just nascent, with a few startups such as Sarvam \u2014 which recently raised $41 million from investors including Lightspeed, Peak XV, and Khosla Ventures \u2014 just getting started on building foundational models.\n\u201cWhile there are over 1,500 AI-based startups in India with over $4 billion of funding, India is still losing the AI innovation battle,\u201d analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said in a note.\nThat leaves a big gap for companies like OpenAI. India, the world\u2019s most populous country and the second-biggest internet market after China, with over 880 million users, presents an opportunity for growth. Altman hinted at the company\u2019s interest in the country during his June visit to the engineering college IIIT Delhi.\n\u201cIt really is amazing to watch what\u2019s happening in India with the embrace of AI \u2014 not just OpenAI but other technologies, too,\u201d he said at the time.\nThat said, the company has yet to disclose any investment in the country (save for the trademark).\nAnd it might not be a fast move. An OpenAI investor told TechCrunch that the company does consider India its key market and is looking to explore opportunities to grow its presence.\nBut with OpenAI\u2019s leadership locked in, now with a more aligned board behind its bolder commercial push, regulation is really one of the last things in the company\u2019s way. And so working on the regulatory front may be the first and most important efforts it can be making right now.\nFor now the task may be more about understanding what direction things will be moving in coming years.\nIndian government officials have indicated multiple times this year that they are not looking to put strict regulations around AI development. India\u2019s IT Minister of State Rajeev Chandrasekhar has repeatedly pushed for international collaboration to develop a framework on regulating AI, with the \u201cguardrails of safety and trust.\u201d\n\u201cWe are very committed to AI,\u201d he said at the Global Technology Summit in New Delhi earlier this week, hosted by Carnegie India and India\u2019s external affairs ministry. \u201cWe certainly are focused on using AI in real-life use cases and our prime minister is absolutely a believer that technology can transform the lives of people, make governments deliver more, deliver faster, deliver better. And so AI is going to be for us used to build models and build capabilities that are aimed at real-life use cases.\u201d\nUnlike OpenAI, its biggest investor and strategic partner Microsoft \u2014 which now has an observer seat on the board \u2014 has a strong hold in India. The software behemoth, which established its local presence in the Indian market back in 1990, has one of its largest R&D centers outside its Redmond headquarters in Bengaluru and three data centers across the country. It has over 20,000 employees across 10 Indian cities. The company is also an active investor in Indian startups.\nWe have contacted OpenAI for comment and will update this post when and if it responds."

      "text": "While OpenAI has cemented its lead in the U.S., Perplexity is taking a different route \u2014 quietly expanding into India to compete in the next phase of AI adoption. The search-focused AI startup is rapidly adding millions of users in the world\u2019s second-largest internet and smartphone market, positioning itself for mass-market scale.\nThis week, Perplexity partnered with Bharti Airtel, India\u2019s second-largest telecom operator after Reliance Jio, to offer a free 12-month Perplexity Pro subscription \u2014 normally worth $200 \u2014 to all 360 million Airtel subscribers. Airtel confirmed to TechCrunch that the deal is exclusive, meaning no other telco in the country can offer Perplexity\u2019s services, including free access, to their subscribers.\nThe Airtel partnership is one of Perplexity\u2019s most significant moves yet in a global expansion strategy that includes partnerships with more than 25 telcos globally, including those recently announced with SoftBank in Japan and SK Telecom in South Korea. It comes down to volume. India, the world\u2019s most populous country, brings a mass market that the San Francisco-based startup will not find in other geographies.\nPerplexity is already gaining major traction in the country. In Q2, Perplexity\u2019s downloads in India surged 600% year-over-year to 2.8 million, according to Sensor Tower data shared exclusively with TechCrunch. In comparison, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT saw a 587% increase, reaching 46.7 million downloads in the same period.\nThe growth trend extended to active users as well: Perplexity\u2019s monthly active users (MAUs) in India increased by 640% year-over-year in Q2, while ChatGPT\u2019s MAUs grew by 350%. India was also the largest market by MAUs for Perplexity in the last quarter, per Sensor Tower. However, ChatGPT maintained a significant lead in absolute numbers, with 19.8 million MAUs versus 3.7 million for Perplexity.\nBuilding on earlier partnerships, Perplexity has been working to leverage India\u2019s user base to leapfrog Western markets, where OpenAI dominates paid subscribers. Earlier this year, Perplexity partnered with the Indian fintech giant Paytm to offer access to its AI-powered search through the Paytm app, which has over 500 million downloads and is among the top-three apps on the Indian government\u2019s Unified Payments Interface network, processing over 1.2 billion transactions worth over \u20b91,34,000 crores (approximately $15.6 billion).\nPerplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has also taken direct steps to expand in India. In January, he announced plans to hire an Indian executive in the country, which he later put on hold after receiving an \u201coverwhelming\u201d response. He further announced a $1 million investment and a commitment of five hours a week of his time to a group building AI in India.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nThe startup has also internally discussed offering its AI search engine to Indian students to grow its reach, sources told TechCrunch.\nOne reason Perplexity views India as a key growth market is the relatively limited number of local AI startups, particularly in the AI search space. At the same time, the country has a large and active base of tech-savvy users \u2014 a fact that has even prompted Perplexity\u2019s archrival Google to launch AI-powered search features like AI Mode and AI Overviews in India ahead of many other markets.\nMonetizing that large user base remains a challenge. Perplexity still lags far behind ChatGPT globally in terms of revenue, even as both offer the same $20-per-month starting price. In Q2, ChatGPT\u2019s in-app purchase revenue worldwide surged 731% year-over-year to $773 million, while Perplexity saw a 300% increase, reaching $8 million, per Sensor Tower.\nThe revenue challenge is particularly acute in India, where consumers are notoriously price-sensitive. Still, there are promising signs. ChatGPT saw an 800% year-over-year increase in in-app purchases to $9 million in the country in Q2. Perplexity has not generated any notable in-app revenue from India, but the startup has room to expand its paid subscriber base through India. Deals like the one with Airtel could help Perplexity effectively increase its subscriber base, at least in the short term.\nStrategic partnerships in markets like India could help Perplexity catch the eye of investors who value user growth and geographic diversification. But to turn that attention into long-term backing, the startup will need to show that it can convert its expanding user base into revenue.\nSrinivas did not respond to requests for comment."

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.
