  "title": "Is Marshall Feeling Generous? These On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones Are Priced Like a Donation",
  "description": "Treat yourself to the Marshall Major V Headphones for under $100.",
  "content": "If on-ear headphones are more your thing, now is a great time to upgrade your listening experience.\n\nWe just spotted the Marshall Major V going for $100 on Amazon after a 38% discount. That\u2019s a $60 drop on a pair that brings the classic Marshall look and sound without breaking the bank, but it\u2019s a limited-time deal. Grab it before the good folks at Amazon decide to push the price back up, or the shelves clear for good.\n\nThe overall look and feel is exactly what you\u2019d expect from a Marshall product \u2013 rugged, but in a good way. The design is foldable, so fitting these in a tote or your backpack won\u2019t be a problem. They fit snugly without being too tight \u2013 you won\u2019t be left with sore ears after an hour of listening.\n\nSound-wise, Marshall sticks to the classics. The pair delivers the familiar Marshall signature sound that is clear and detailed without being too overpowering. Rihanna\u2019s Diamonds plays with clean highs, while Jordan Peterson\u2019s podcasts will be even easier to follow. From gamers to casual listeners, everyone will appreciate the instant sound quality upgrade it brings. Note that these don\u2019t offer active noise cancelling, so you\u2019ll still hear some background sounds while having them on.\n\nYou\u2019re also getting over 100 hours of wireless playtime (you read that right) on a single charge. That\u2019s way more than most headphones and earbuds offer in this price range. Use them for a week straight without worrying about battery life, or even take these with you on short trips without the charger. Plus, since Major V supports wireless charging, you don\u2019t have to stick to cables at all. Snap them onto a compatible wireless charger when you\u2019re out and about for a quick top-up.\n\nThe headphones feature a customizable M-button on the left speaker, which activates Spotify Tap by default \u2013 no need to open your phone or app to start playing music. If that\u2019s not your thing, you can reassign it to modify your EQ settings or access voice assistant for added convenience.\n\nIn conclusion, these Marshall headphones offer a bunch of advanced features with great sound and an impressive battery life, all for just $100. While the headphones are available in four colors, only the black and the cream colors are discounted. We don\u2019t expect them to stay in stock or on sale for long, so if you\u2019ve been looking to invest in a solid pair of headphones, this might be it.",
