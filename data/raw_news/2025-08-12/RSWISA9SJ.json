  "description": "Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown prepares Senate comeback bid after bruising defeat that saw him lose reelection for his fourth consecutive term.",
  "content": "After losing his re-election bid in 2024, three-term Ohio Democratic senator Sherrod Brown will be launching a new bid next year to return to his position, according to a report.\n\nBrown's plans to run for Senate were shared with local media by three Ohio labor leaders who said that Brown had confided in them directly about the plans. Other Ohio Democrats also expressed to the outlet that they had heard of Brown's plan from members of his inner circle, and the reporting follows news that Brown has been interviewing campaign managers for his upcoming bid.\n\nBrown was ousted in 2024 by MAGA challenger and current freshman Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno, who came out victorious with 50.2% of the vote, compared to Brown's 46.4%.\n\nSENATE DEMOCRATS ARE FEVERISHLY RECRUITING TOP CANDIDATES TO WIN BACK MAJORITY IN 2026 MIDTERMS\n\nDespite the brushing defeat, Democratic Party Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, has reportedly lobbied Brown to run for months.\n\nIf selected as the Democratic Party's candidate, Brown's likely GOP opponent would be Sen. Jon Husted, R-Ohio, who was appointed to fill Vice President J.D. Vance's seat after he left for the White House. A 2026 special election will decide who will serve out the remainder of Vance's term, which lasts until 2029.\n\n\"Should Brown enter the race as Schumer\u2019s handpicked candidate he will be starting in the biggest hole of his political career,\" said Tyson Shepard, spokesman for Husted's campaign.\n\n\"He has never faced a candidate like Jon Husted. Brown\u2019s slogans will ring hollow as his coalition walks away, tired of the radical policies he\u2019s forced to support to appease his coastal bosses in California and New York.\"\n\nOhio, often seen as a key battleground state, has been trending towards Republicans. In 2024, President Donald Trump won the state by more than 10 percentage points.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSince Brown left his position in the senate, he founded the Dignity of Work Institute, which says it is \"dedicated to the people who make this country work, and to creating an economy and a society where Americans\u2019 work is valued.\"\n\nBrown, nor his representatives, could be reached for comment.",

      "text": "As they mount their uphill effort to win back the Senate majority in next year's midterm elections, Democrats feel that they're on a roll.\nLate last month, they landed their biggest recruit to date, when former two-term Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina declared his candidacy in the 2026 race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Thom Tillis.\nDemocrats view the open Senate seat in the crucial southeastern battleground state as a top pick-up opportunity next year as they try to win back control of the Senate, which the Republicans currently hold with a 53-47 majority.\n\"It\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of getting Gov. Cooper to run for the Senate in North Carolina, and already we are seeing a potential for a ripple effect,\" longtime Democratic strategist Chris Moyer told Fox News Digital.\nTHIS REPUBLICAN JUST JUMPED INTO BATTLEGROUND GEORGIA'S HIGH-PROFILE SENATE RACE\nMoyer, a veteran campaign communicator, said that Cooper recruitment is \"giving more faith to potential candidates who are questioning whether there\u2019s a chance for a Democratic majority in the Senate next year.\"\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) Chair Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, after landing Cooper, said he \"is a formidable candidate who will flip North Carolina\u2019s Senate seat.\"\nTop Democrats now have their eyes on former Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who lost last year's re-election bid in a onetime top swing state that's become reliably red over the past decade.\nWHAT A TOP POLITICAL HANDICAPPER SAID ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS' CHANCES TO WIN BACK SENATE IN 2026\nSchumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, trekked to Ohio this summer in hopes of convincing Brown to take on Republican Sen. Jon Husted, Fox News confirmed.\nBrown, who served over three decades in the House and later the Senate, is viewed by Democrats as the only candidate who could potentially topple Husted, who was named at the beginning of this year to fill the seat left vacant when then-Sen. JD Vance stepped down to become vice president.\nDemocrats landed the candidate they were hoping for in swing state New Hampshire in the race to succeed retiring longtime Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.\nFour-term Rep. Chris Pappas' announcement in early April that he would run to succeed Shaheen has cleared the Democratic primary field, as of now, of any potential rivals for the party's Senate nomination.\nMeanwhile, a Republican primary in the state \u2013 where the GOP hasn't won a Senate race in 15 years \u2013 is heating up between former Sen. Scott Brown and state Sen. Dan Innis, with the possibility of more candidates entering the race.\nIn battleground Georgia, which President Donald Trump narrowly carried in last year's White House race, Republicans view first-term Sen. Jon Ossoff as the most vulnerable Democrat incumbent up for re-election next year.\nBut Ossoff is off to a very hot fundraising start, and a GOP primary between Reps. Mike Collins and Buddy Carter, and former college and professional football coach Derek Dooley, is starting to turn combustible.\nOf potential concern for the Democrats is Michigan, where the dynamics appear to be the opposite of Georgia, in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Gary Peters.\nFormer Rep. Mike Rogers, the 2024 GOP Senate nominee who narrowly lost last year's race, appears to have cleared the Republican, thanks in great part to Trump's endorsement and likely arm twisting by the president's political team.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have a very competitive primary on their hands. The primary race includes three well-known Democrats: Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, and former gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed, who enjoys the backing of progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\nWhile Texas has long been a reliable red state, and conservative firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz comfortably won re-election last year, Democrats are optimistic about their 2026 chances to potentially flip a red seat to blue.\nThat's because longtime GOP Sen. John Cornyn is facing a serious primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a MAGA world rockstar.\nPaxton has long been surrounded by scandals, and is now dealing with a headline-grabbing divorce with his wife, state Sen. Angela Paxtom. And Democrats believe if Paxton topples Cornyn in next March's GOP primary, he'll be toxic in the general election.\nBut Democrats could have a competitive primary in Texas as well.\nFormer Rep. Colin Allred, who lost to Cruz last November, launched a second straight campaign earlier this year.\nFormer Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who came close to ousting Cruz in the state's 20218 Senate election before unsuccessfully running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination and losing the 2022 Texas gubernatorial race to GOP Gov. Greg Abbott, is taking a hard look at a 2026 Senate run.\nState Rep. James Talarico, who grabbed national attention recently for his appearance with popular podcaster Joe Rogan, and Rep. Joaquin Castro, are also mulling bids.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nDemocrats also feel they may have a shot in Iowa \u2013 a onetime swing state that's become firmly red in recent election cycles \u2013 if Republican Sen. Joni Ernst decides against seeking a third term in the Senate.\nBut they'll likely have a much better chance of flipping a GOP-held seat in blue state Maine if longtime Republican incumbent Sen. Susan Collins decides against seeking re-election."

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President.

Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022.
