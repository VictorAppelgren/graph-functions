      "summary": "Former President Donald Trump has accumulated over $100 million in state, municipal, and corporate bonds since taking office, a move that could benefit from falling yields if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. Trump has urged a 300‑basis‑point rate cut, but the Fed has maintained its stance, citing inflation and tariff impacts. Market pricing currently reflects an 84% chance of a 25‑basis‑point cut at the September meeting, with bond yields already falling after Powell’s comments at Jackson Hole. The bond purchases represent a small fraction of Trump’s $6 billion net worth, and the exact upside from rate cuts remains uncertain.",
