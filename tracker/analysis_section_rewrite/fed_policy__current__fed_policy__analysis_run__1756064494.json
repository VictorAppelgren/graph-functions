      "feedback": "Solid base: you weave macro policy, tariff dynamics, and housing-policy friction into a 0–3 week view, and you cite multiple sources to anchor the narrative. To reach world‑class quality, sharpen the causal chain, tighten horizon‑specific logic, and quantify every claim with explicit thresholds drawn from the sources, while explicitly reconciling conflicts across sources. Edit plan (compact, actionable): 1) Declutter and cadence the causal chain into three crisp channels—policy/monetary (Powell signaling a possible next‑month rate cut; cite 0J41Q7KTX), tariff/external demand (tariffs >10% of imports and a record US trade deficit around $692B with an export share near 37%; cite 0J41Q7KTX and the Forbes piece in 0J41Q7KTX), and housing/credit (Bethel’s tight supply, median price ≈$582k–$583k, 5% affordable stock, 75‑unit Vessel project; cite F8GF45MEU). 2) Make the near‑term catalysts explicit with thresholds: if Powell’s signaling crystallizes into a confirmed rate cut next month, treat as a risk‑on impulse; if tariff escalation or legal challenges pull on growth/inflation, treat as a braking impulse; explicitly state the “invalidation” condition (e.g., data showing no near‑term rate cut or a sharper‑than‑expected tariffs shock; cite the sources that define these dynamics). 3) Quantify balance‑sheet/consumption risk using numbers from the car/credit literature: average new car loan rate around 6.43% (Fed, cited in CDBMWIUTB) and high depreciation risk for EVs (also in CDBMWIUTB) to justify a cautious stance on durable goods demand; 4) Separate, with clear causality, the domestic housing channel: Bethel metrics (median price ~$582k; 5% affordable stock; 8‑30g) imply supply constraints and zoning/policy risk that can affect construction and regional credit cycles; 5) Tighten sourcing discipline: attach a source ID to every factual claim (e.g., 0J41Q7KTX for trade data, U6HXAJR4J for Lagarde’s independence argument, F8GF45MEU for Bethel housing, CDBMWIUTB for car depreciation/negative equity); where sources conflict (e.g., depreciation assessments by brands), acknowledge range and cite the oldest/most robust numbers or frame as brand‑level dispersion rather than a blanket market view; 6) Revise the forecast to a single, testable base case plus two alternative paths (best case: rate cut expectations materialize; worse case: tariff shock dominates), and map each to observable near‑term data releases (trade data, Fed communications, Connecticut 8‑30g developments, and auto‑lending/equipment data). 7) Condense the prose to the horizon style: a tight opening sentence on the three channels, a bulleted near‑term catalyst section (with numeric anchors), a succinct reaction function, and a monitoring list; remove extraneous asides and non‑core headlines. 8) Add explicit thresholds for monitoring next: tariffs’ share of imports approaching or surpassing 10%, trade deficit breaking above/near $692B, export ratio dipping below 37%, Bethel housing stock under 10% of affordability, and car‑loan rates holding above 6% or rising, with corresponding macro implications. This will elevate you to a higher signal‑to‑noise ratio and strengthen both the credibility and actionable utility of the piece.",
