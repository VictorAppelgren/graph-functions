Over the years, the company has evolved from a relatively small community user-based auction site to a commercial behemoth.\n\nI found today\u2019s Chart of the Day by using Barchart\u2019s powerful screening functions to sort for stocks with the highest technical buy signals; superior current momentum in both strength and direction; and a Trend Seeker \u201cbuy\u201d signal. I then used Barchart\u2019s Flipcharts feature to review the charts for consistent price appreciation. EBAY checks those boxes. Since the Trend Seeker signaled a buy on July 10, the stock has gained 25.69%.\n\u2022 Warren Buffett Warns Investing At \u2018Too-High Purchase Price\u2019 Even for \u2018an Excellent Company\u2019 Can Undo a Decade of Smart Investing\n\u2022 BitMine Immersion Now Holds 1.15 Million Ethereum Tokens.
