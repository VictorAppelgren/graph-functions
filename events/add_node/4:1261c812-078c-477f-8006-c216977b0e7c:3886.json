      "rationale": "The Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program is a federal policy that determines grant allocation for broadband infrastructure. While it can influence the competitive landscape for telecom and satellite companies, its effects are structural and medium‑to‑long‑term rather than immediate intraday market drivers. Thus it aligns with the policy type guidance for importance level 4."
