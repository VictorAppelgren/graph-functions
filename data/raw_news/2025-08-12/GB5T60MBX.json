  "description": "The driver was ready to intervene, but never needed to.",
  "content": "Tesla has shared a time-lapse video showing one of its vehicles in Full Self-driving mode traveling some 360 miles from San Francisco to LA seemingly without any human intervention.\n\nThe drive (below), which ordinarily takes up to seven hours, also included a stop at a Supercharger station to replenish the car\u2019s battery.\n\nTo keep within the law, someone is sitting in the driver\u2019s seat the entire way, hands-on-lap and ready to take over control of the car at a moment\u2019s notice if required. Tesla\u2019s setup includes the deployment of a driver-facing camera that checks the person in the driving seat is attentive and looking at the road ahead while the car is in motion.\n\nThe recent trip demonstrates Tesla\u2019s confidence in FSD\u2019s ability to handle long-distance, complex driving without human intervention, from pulling away to parking up.\n\nBut despite the progress, FSD remains controversial in some quarters and is not considered fully autonomous by regulatory standards. In California, for example, Tesla\u2019s FSD is still classified as a Level 2 driver assistance system \u2014 where Level 5 is full automation \u2014 that requires driver supervision and readiness to intervene.\n\nTesla chief Elon Musk revealed last week that the automaker is currently training a a much-improved FSD model that could get a public release by the end of September if testing goes well.\n\nThe recent supervised drive down the West Coast comes nearly two months after Tesla debuted its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. In those vehicles, no one is sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, though they\u2019re using a version of FSD that\u2019s not yet available to regular Tesla owners.\n\nTesla also launched a ride-hailing service in San Francisco at the end of July, though the absence of the required permits means it\u2019s unable to call it a \u201crobotaxi\u201d service, and therefore someone needs to be in the driver\u2019s seat during the FSD-powered ride.",

      "text": "Tesla kicked off its robotaxi service on Sunday, transporting passengers around Austin, Texas. The automaker shared a bunch of videos taken by riders who recorded some of the first trips.\nTesla has 10 self-driving Model Y electric cars on the roads of the city, and for now each one has a so-called \u201cTesla Safety Monitor\u201d sitting in the front passenger seat, while the driver\u2019s seat stays empty. The vehicles are also being monitored remotely by Tesla personnel.\nRiders can call a Tesla robotaxi using the new Robotaxi App. Videos shared by the first invitation-only riders show a rear-seat tablet displaying a map and the amount of time left until the vehicle is expected to reach the selected destination.\nAn email sent recently to the first riders describes the terms of the service. The message notes that the autonomous rides will take place within a geofenced area in Austin, with a map of the available riding area shown inside the app. Rides can be taken between 6 a.m. and midnight throughout the week.\n\u201cWhile the Early Access phase is invitation-only, you are permitted to bring up to one additional guest, so long as they are 18+ and you remain present with them for the duration of the ride,\u201d the email said.\nIt added that Tesla\u2019s robotaxi service may be limited or unavailable during poor weather, which presumably means conditions such as heavy rain or fog.\nTesla has yet to launch the futuristic Cybercab robotaxi, which it unveiled at a special event last year. The Cybercab comes without a steering wheel and pedals, but it could be a while before the vehicle becomes part of Tesla\u2019s robotaxi service.\nIn Austin, Tesla\u2019s robotaxis are riding alongside other autonomous vehicles operated by Alphabet-owned Waymo and Amazon-owned Zoox. Both have been testing their self-driving cars on the city\u2019s roads for some time, with Waymo offering rides to paying customers.\nIf you\u2019re interested in taking a ride in a Tesla robotaxi when it comes to your city, you can sign up on Tesla\u2019s website."

      "text": "Tesla has rolled out a ride-hailing service in San Francisco, but the lack of a permit to allow it to accept fares from passengers means that it can\u2019t yet call it a robotaxi service.\nThe first Tesla Model 3 and Model Y cars hit the streets of San Francisco on Thursday, just over a month after the launch of its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, where it does have the proper permits.\nA video uploaded by a passenger to X shows a Tesla employee with his hands touching the steering wheel as the car drove along in FSD (Full self-driving) mode, Tesla\u2019s advanced driver-assist feature.\nThe California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) stated recently that at the current time, Tesla has to have a safety driver behind the wheel for testing, as well as to transport members of the public, Reuters reported.\nThe regulator added that the automaker has to undertake a pilot phase that imposes no charges on passengers before applying for full-autonomous permits, a process that Reuters says took competitors such as Waymo \u201cyears\u201d to complete.\nTesla is inviting employees\u2019 friends and family, and select members of the public, to participate in the early stage of the service.\nIn June, the automaker launched its first robotaxi service in Austin, with a safety monitor sitting in the front passenger seat, not the driver\u2019s seat. And unlike the Tesla\u2019s ride-hailing cars in San Francisco, Austin\u2019s Model Y vehicles have \u201crobotaxi\u201d branding on the side.\nMusk said recently that Tesla is planning to get permits to launch its robotaxi service in a number of states, including not only California but also Nevada, Arizona, and Florida.\nIn California, strict regulations have prevented Musk from experiencing the kind of rapid robotaxi rollout that was possible in Texas. Essentially, the San Francisco launch appears to be a strategic move by Tesla to maintain momentum in the autonomous-vehicle sector."

      "text": "Tesla is aiming to put its first robotaxis on public roads in June, the automaker\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk, said on Wednesday.\nSpeaking during a call with investors following the release of Tesla\u2019s latest financial results, Musk said the plan is to begin with a paid robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June, using vehicles with a version of Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. He added that a paid ridesharing service using unsupervised autonomous Teslas would expand to other U.S. cities \u201cby the end of this year,\u201d with launches in the first overseas markets coming some time in 2026, though he cautioned that regulatory constraints in locations like the EU and China could result in delays.\nMusk mentioned plans for a robotaxi service last fall during the glitzy unveiling of the company\u2019s first Cybercab autonomous taxi prototype, suggesting that Tesla would begin by using Model Y and Model 3 vehicles rather than the Cybercab, which does away with a steering wheel and pedals.\nRegarding the immediate plan for Austin, Musk said the service would start with a fleet of Tesla-operated vehicles, adding that next year he\u2019d like to have a system where any Tesla owner would be able to offer their vehicle for autonomous ridesharing trips when they\u2019re not using it.\nMusk said that Tesla sees the Austin launch as \u201cputting a toe in the water [to] make sure everything\u2019s OK,\u201d adding that the \u201csafety of the general public and those in the car [is] our top priority.\u201d\nIndeed, Tesla\u2019s first robotaxis will be closely watched as they begin carrying paying passengers around the streets of the Texas city. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched a number of investigations into the safety of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and FSD technologies, while critics claim that Tesla safety reports lack details, making it difficult to make comparisons with national averages or to draw meaningful conclusions about real-world safety.\nIn a mark of the safety challenges facing such autonomous-car initiatives, General Motors recently ended funding for robotaxi firm Cruise following a number of troubling incidents, including one where an autonomous Cruise car ran over a woman in San Francisco.\nA Bloomberg report in December said that Tesla had been in touch with Austin\u2019s autonomous vehicle task force to establish safety expectations for the incoming Tesla robotaxis.\nIn Wednesday\u2019s call with investors, Musk said that \u201cthousands of [Tesla] cars every day are driving with no one in them at our Fremont factory in California.\u201d Tesla released a video (below) on Wednesday showing the empty cars in action, commenting that it\u2019s \u201cone step closer to large-scale unsupervised FSD.\u201d\nTeslas now drive themselves from their birthplace at the factory to their designated loading dock lanes without human intervention\nOne step closer to large-scale unsupervised FSD pic.twitter.com/Aj6dHsLaRO\n\u2014 Tesla AI (@Tesla_AI) January 29, 2025"
