  "title": "INVESTOR ALERT: Pomerantz Law Firm Investigates Claims On Behalf of Investors of The Trade Desk, Inc. - TTD",
  "description": "",
  "content": "NEW YORK, Aug. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP is investigating claims on behalf of investors of The Trade Desk, Inc. (\u201cTTD\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NASDAQ: TTD). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, ext. 7980.\n\nThe investigation concerns whether TTD and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.\n\n[Click here for information about joining the class action]\n\nAfter the market closed on August 7, 2025, TTD reported disappointing second quarter 2025 financial results. In response, the Company received multiple downgrades due to company execution, including a double downgrade by Bank of America. For example, a Bank of America analyst stated in an investor note that \u201c[w]hen TTD reported 4Q24 results, it missed guidance for the first time as a public company, raising concerns about competitive pressures, execution and whether it could sustain 20%+ long-term growth to support its premium valuation.\u201d In addition, TTD announced the departure of its longtime Chief Financial Officer.\n\nOn this news, TTD\u2019s stock price fell $34.10 per share, or 38.6%, to close at $54.23 per share on August 8, 2025.\n\nPomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomlaw.com.",
