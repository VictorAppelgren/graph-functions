  "title": "I\u2019ve Brought Home Lamps From Japan and Italy. But This IKEA Globe Is My Favorite.",
  "description": "My IKEA globe lamp sits on my TV console, but it\u2019d look great atop a side table, nestled on a shelf, and even in the kitchen.",
  "content": "I was on the hunt for a little lamp to sit on my media console and balance out the comparatively harsh blue light from my TV when I stumbled across the humble IKEA Fado Table Lamp . I was transfixed. Its straightforward orb design, gentle glow, and just-right size instantly made the cut.\n\nI love lamps so much that part of the allure of moving into a sprawling house is filling it with all the lamps I want to add to my collection. But in reality, I live in a one-bedroom apartment, so I have to be choosy about what lamps take up precious real estate in my home.\n\nI love lamps \u2014 big and small, floor and table, modern and traditional. I scour estate sales and shop for them when I\u2019m traveling, like the time I risked an overweight bag for a curvy alabaster lamp in San Gimignano, Italy (which I happily rewired with an American plug), or when I scampered back to Kappabashi street in Tokyo before my flight because I truly needed one of the lanterns that hang outside restaurants (mine says \u201cramen\u201d).\n\nAs a frequent IKEA shopper, I\u2019m usually pretty keyed in on popular, new, and seasonal items, but I will admit that this lamp\u2014which has been a mainstay in IKEA\u2019s lineup of tabletop lighting since its release in 2005\u2014wasn\u2019t on my radar until a few years ago.\n\nWhile the Fado might be one you pass over for the internet-famous Varmblixt LED Table/Wall Lamp or more sculptural Simrishamn Table Lamp, its simple design is what makes it so versatile. A 10-inch glass globe sits atop a footed base that holds a light bulb of your choosing, and it has a 6-foot cord with a small switch to turn it on and off. Its milky glass globe diffuses light, creating an ethereal effect.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have any special bells and whistles, but that\u2019s par for the course with Scandi design. And that simplicity has its advantages: Smooth glass shades are particularly easy to wipe down, and it doesn\u2019t have indentations or crenulations that can make cleaning a chore. The Fado lamp is totally unfussy, and it adds a very distinct mid-century modern vibe to any room it\u2019s in.\n\nWith a 10-inch diameter, its Goldilocks size means it can fit nearly anywhere. I keep mine on my TV console (as I intended), but it looks just as distinguished as a kitchen lamp (where any cooking grease can be quickly wiped away), atop a side table in a living room, or nestled between books on a shelf in an office.\n\nSenior staff writer Joshua Lyon, who covers home design at Wirecutter, has long admired his friend\u2019s smoky gray Fado lamp, which he says \u201clooks beautiful placed on the floor against a wall.\u201d While this color has been discontinued, you may have luck finding it on secondhand market sites like Etsy or eBay, since there\u2019s always a resale appetite for archival IKEA pieces. Plus, IKEA could always bring it back for a limited (or even permanent) run, like they did with the Nytillverkad collection of vintage designs.\n\nJoshua even considered the Fado lamp when writing his guide to the best bedside lamps, as he\u2019s a fellow fan of the Swedish lamp. In the end, he says, \u201cWe decided that those picks should be able to direct the light beam away from a bed partner in some way, and you can\u2019t do that with a Fado.\u201d If you don\u2019t share a bed or aren\u2019t bothered by this caveat, it\u2019s certainly a vibey addition to a nightstand.\n\nFor a bit of an upgrade, I keep a smart bulb in my Fado, which lets me adjust color temperature and brightness without a manual dimmer (which the lamp lacks) as well as control it all with my voice since it\u2019s connected to my Alexa. I was once a smart-home skeptic, but switching to smart bulbs in all my lighting has greatly improved my day-to-day.\n\nSince my Fado sits next to my TV, being able to adjust the brightness from my couch is immensely helpful for setting the ideal movie ambiance. And the transition from day to night is much less dreary when I can chirp at Alexa to turn on my various lamps; it particularly eases the 4 p.m. dread in winter.\n\nIf I were to change anything about the Fado lamp, it would be to upgrade the base material from polypropylene to something more substantial, like chrome or molded glass. It\u2019s a bit finicky to get the base to clip onto the glass globe when you need to change the light bulb, too, but for about $30, these minor gripes are an easy trade-off.\n\nHopefully one day, I\u2019ll level up to a house with more rooms than my city apartment, and I can fill it with every oddball lamp I come across. For now, though, the Fado has earned its spot in my small home, and you can bet it\u2019s getting wrapped up and loaded on the moving truck when I eventually do score some more square footage.\n\nThis article was edited by Katie Okamoto and Megan Beauchamp.",

      "text": "Our Favorite Bedside Lamps\nI used to think that the best bedside lamp was the one you personally thought looked great with the rest of your decor.\nThat changed when I unwillingly received what felt like accidental Lasik surgery from a new lamp I\u2019d bought for my husband\u2019s side of the bed. With a shade that exposed too much bulb, this lamp sent a searing beam of light across our pillows, opening my eyes both literally and figuratively.\nAesthetics still play a crucial role when it comes to selecting the right lamp for winding down before sleep. But taking a few other benchmarks into consideration will help make every night a good one.\nThe research\n- Why you should trust us\n- How we picked and tested\n- Pretty pleats: Hay Matin Table Lamp\n- A paper lantern with heft: West Elm Mooney Table Lamp\n- Slanted and enchanted: West Elm Asymmetry Ceramic Table Lamp\n- Arm yourself: Stuff By Andrew Neyer Swing Dome Light\n- Mid-century charm: Quinn Table Lantern\n- A classic silhouette: IKEA \u00c5rstid Table Lamp\n- Cheap and convenient: Yarra-Decor Bedside Table Lamp with USB Ports\n- Cheap, reliable, and cute: Threshold Assembled Ceramic Table Lamp-Blue\n- What about vintage lamps?\n- What to look forward to\n- The competition\n- Sources\nWhy you should trust us\nI\u2019m a senior staff writer at Wirecutter covering home and decor. I visit home-goods and furniture stores and showrooms for a living. My bedroom-related coverage has included bed frames, nightstands, and an incredibly effective cooling and heating mattress pad.\nFor this guide:\n- I researched hundreds of lamps from 28 different companies before arriving at our picks.\n- Like all Wirecutter journalists, I review and test products with complete editorial independence. I\u2019m never made aware of any business implications of my editorial recommendations. Read more about our editorial standards.\nHow we picked and tested\nBedside lights are a quiet, underrated workhorse in the home. Any table lamp will cover the most basic illumination needs, but bedside lamps are expected to also help us seamlessly settle in for the night, and they should gently illuminate the room when we need to wake up in the dark. As we searched for promising models to test, we began to notice the many little things that frustrate us when bedside lights are not up to task.\nWith all of that in mind, we decided that the best bedside lamps should do the following:\n- A bedside lamp should turn on and off with an in-line switch, a pull chain, or touch control, or it should be compatible with a smart bulb, because it\u2019s annoying to have to fumble around inside the shade in the dark.\n- It should have a shade that efficiently diffuses light or redirects it.\n- A bedside lamp should have a stable base so it doesn\u2019t get knocked over if it\u2019s accidentally nudged.\n- Its cord should be a minimum of 5 feet long.\n- It should be dimmable (or compatible with a smart bulb to make it so).\n- A bedside lamp should work with common/accessible bulbs (with a few exceptions).\nKnowing that looks are entirely subjective, we crowdsourced Wirecutter staffers for their favorites. And we spoke to three interior designers\u2014Nicholas Obeid, Shannon Maldonado, and Jessica Davis\u2014with different styles. They provided a range of perspectives on other things you should think about when choosing bedside lamps, from the height of your bedside tables to considering a vintage lamp instead of a new one.\nAfter three weeks of research, I landed on 15 promising models and brought them into my home. I assembled them, inspected every feature and claim, and slept (and woke up) beside them for three to four nights per lamp (and in some cases longer). In the end, I arrived at nine great picks with a variety of price points (starting at $20). Our picks play nicely with a variety of style preferences, and each will bring the right amount of reading light and nighttime ambience to any bedroom.\nPretty pleats: Hay Matin Table Lamp\nJust look at that shade. This guide\u2019s original author, Gregory Han, described the HAY Matin Table Lamp as having \u201ca minimalist design evocative of Paris and chinoiserie.\u201d His wife was a fan as well, even though the shade reminded her of \u201cthe spiral remnants of a gigantic sharpened pencil.\u201d\nDimming works from high to low. Designed by Inga Semp\u00e9, the HAY Matin lamp's in-line and touch activated dimmer switch toggles between its three brightness settings from the highest level of brightness and ends on the lowest. This order is my personal preference -- many other dimmable lamps work in reverse, so if you use them by the bed, they jar you wide awake with a bright flash just as you\u2019re trying to ease the room into darkness. But if you wake frequently in the night, to, say, use the bathroom or tend to an infant, you might prefer a lamp that switches on to the dimmest setting first, so you don\u2019t flood the room with a bright light right away. This lamp\u2019s integrated LED bulb isn\u2019t replaceable, but the manual claims an expected lifespan of 25,000 hours, or eight to 10 years with regular use.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nAssembly can be challenging. It took six attempts to secure the Matin\u2019s PVC-laminated shade in place, an issue that Gregory also encountered. The shade arrived in a tight cone shape, stiff and compressed, and it repeatedly leapt out of my hands as I tried to unfurl it and secure it into place. A second set of hands would likely make the process easier.\nThe base could be sturdier. The Matin lamp\u2019s minimalist, lightweight frame (made from steel with a brass finish) balances weight evenly, and I didn\u2019t encounter stability issues. But should any arise, you can solve the problem by using the space at the bottom of the lamp to corral your bedside books.\nKey specs:\n- Colors/finishes: This lamp offers seven shade colors, but stock fluctuates (we tested the vampy oxide red).\n- Switch style: in-line dimmer, touch-controlled\n- Dimensions: 20\u00bd by 13\u215e inches (height by width; base: 11\u00bd by 11\u00bd inches)\n- Additional styles/sizes: several versions, including a smaller lamp option, a corded sconce, a flush mount, and a pendant.\n- Returns/warranty: 30-day returns, one-year warranty\n- Bulb/socket type: integrated LED\nA paper lantern with heft: West Elm Mooney Table Lamp\nThe base won\u2019t tip or slide. Lamps with paper lantern shades often prove too unstable for bedside use, due to lightweight bases that cause them to tip if you so much as graze the side. The 12-inch West Elm Mooney Table Lamp\u2019s 2-pound circular walnut-finished base anchors the lamp in place, while creating a soothing juxtaposition between fragile and solid materials.\nAssembly is simple. Just prop the paper lantern up by the shade hanger, and use the three white cylindrical screws to fasten the shade in place. The screws are located on the interior, out of sight. The paper\u2019s slightly yellow tint emits a soothing, warm glow.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nSome construction details are a little noticeable. It\u2019s definitely not a Noguchi. Paper lanterns are assembled in segments, and the section lines where each one attaches are clearly visible. This construction process is often near-seamless on higher-end paper lanterns, and while the slight asymmetry on the Mooney didn\u2019t bother us, it might annoy some.\nThis lamp takes up a lot of nightstand real estate. With its 12\u00bd inch shade, the Mooney lamp works best for wider bedside tables.\nKey specs:\n- Colors/finishes: There\u2019s just the one.\n- Switch style: in-line on/off\n- Dimensions: 12 by 12\u00bd inches (height by diameter; base diameter: 8 inches)\n- Additional styles/sizes: a 34-inch-tall floor lamp\n- Warranty/return policy: 30-day returns, no listed warranty (But West Elm told us it will review any product defects within a year of purchase.)\n- Bulb/socket type: E26, not included\nSlanted and enchanted: West Elm Asymmetry Ceramic Table Lamp\nThe construction feels solid. The ceramic base on this lamp is stable, so it won\u2019t topple easily, unless you tip it over on purpose. The linen shade also feels sturdy and disperses light with a nice glow. The in-line switch on the cord is uncomplicated and simple to turn on and off.\nIt almost doubles as a work of art. The earthy design incorporates just the right amount of whimsy to remind us of something you\u2019d find in a pottery shop.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThe cord doesn\u2019t quite match the vibe. Compared with the subtle elegance of the lamp itself, the fabric-wrapped cord\u2014a style we often like on other lamps\u2014looks somewhat unrefined here.\nA little sliding may occur. While the base won\u2019t topple, the fabric liner at the bottom, meant to protect surfaces, glides almost too easily when the lamp is deliberately pushed across the table.\nKey Specs:\n- Colors/finishes: It comes in sage, green, white, speckled moss, and black.\n- Switch style: in-line on/off switch\n- Dimensions: 17 by 10 inches (height by diameter; base diameter: 6\u00bc inches)\n- Additional styles/sizes: 19-inch- and 31-inch-tall options\n- Warranty/return policy: 30-day returns, no listed warranty (But West Elm told us it will review any product defects within a year of purchase.)\n- Bulb/socket type: E26, not included\nArm yourself: Stuff By Andrew Neyer Swing Dome Light\nPlenty of reach for bigger beds. The arm on the Stuff By Andrew Neyer Swing Dome Light (small) has a vast, 30-inch swing path, so we think it\u2019s best suited for king-size beds in large rooms. (The big version has a whopping 48-inch reach.) But if you have the space, and you like an industrial look mixed with warm wood accents, Neyer\u2019s got you covered. Because of its size, this lamp is not subtle\u2014expect it to become a fairly major statement piece.\nThe design is extremely thoughtful. The wide, rotating swivel shade easily diverts the beam from bed partners or up toward the ceiling for accent lighting. There\u2019s more than enough distance between the arm and the round, in-line dimmer switch (which affixes to the wall via an adhesive) to prevent someone from bonking their head in bed. The socket is a smaller, E12 size, and a G16.5 bulb is recommended. (The Swing Dome comes with one.)\nCustomer service is top notch. Got questions? Talk to the designer himself\u2014Andrew Neyer often answers calls to the company\u2019s headquarters, at 1-800-867-5319. And he\u2019s delightful to chat with.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nWe can\u2019t overstate how big this light is. Be sure to measure your space and refer to Neyer\u2019s complete measurements, including the arm\u2019s swing path (all pictured below), to confirm this lamp is a good fit for your space.\nYou\u2019ll need two people to mount it. Due to this lamp\u2019s weight and long, moving arm, installing it will be easier with a second set of hands, and you\u2019ll definitely need to use the included anchors.\nKey specs:\n- Colors/finishes: It comes in black or white.\n- Switch style: in-line dimmer\n- Dimensions: 30 by 11 inches (width/span by height; see cut sheet for more details)\n- Additional styles/sizes: a 48-inch version\n- Warranty/return policy: 30-day returns, plus shipping cost and a 20% restocking fee (And the company told us there\u2019s a one-year warranty from the shipping date.)\n- Bulb/socket type: E12, included\nMid-century charm: Quinn Table Lantern\nIt\u2019s stylish enough for Broadway. We were drawn to the Quinn Table Lantern for its subtle, mid-century style, and we\u2019re not alone in loving it. Weeks after testing this lamp, we spotted it (or an eerily exact replica) onstage as part of the decor in Stereophonic. (When it comes to this beat, we\u2019re always on the clock.)\nThe base is super-stable. Structured like an inverted tripod, its wood frame cradles the shade instead of carrying it, providing a supportive, triangular foundation. The Quinn\u2019s cord, which is wrapped in simple brown cloth, complements the base.\nYou can buy it at multiple sellers. We found the Quinn at West Elm, but it\u2019s made by Adesso and sold at other retailers, like Lightology and Lighting Supply.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIf you find it in a different finish, check the shade. We initially evaluated a now-discontinued version of this lamp with painted-black wood. But we dismissed it due to how visible and glaring the bulb looked through its differently designed and loosely woven shade. Should Adesso release additional finishes in the future, compare the shade to our pick to make sure it\u2019s the same.\nOne model had a slight production defect. The socket on our second Quinn lamp was slightly crooked, which meant the shade wasn\u2019t quite centered. Since we got ours from West Elm, an exchange would be covered through its policy of reviewing any product defects within a year of purchase.\nKey specs:\n- Colors/finishes: It is available in walnut.\n- Switch style: pull chain\n- Dimensions: 17 by 9 inches (height by diameter; shade diameter: 8 inches)\n- Additional styles/sizes: a table lamp and a floor lamp\n- Warranty/return policy: varies, depending on the retailer\n- Bulb/socket type: E26, not included\nA classic silhouette: IKEA \u00c5rstid Table Lamp\nThis is the lamp version of a friend who gets along with everyone. The IKEA \u00c5rstid Table Lamp straddles the border between basic and elegant, but we don\u2019t mean basic in a bad way. The slim profile and simple pleated white shade complement all sorts of environments\u2014adding an aristocratic touch to a shabby-chic room or a breath of fresh air inside a rustic country cabin.\nIt\u2019s solidly built. A subtly tiered and surprisingly heavy base keeps the lamp anchored in place, and the ball at the end of its pull chain switch is nicely weighted, so it won\u2019t knock against the pole. Should an aggressive yank cause it to hit, the resulting sound is more of a soft thud than a sharp clang.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThe cord is a blemish. \u00c5rstid\u2019s stiff white electrical cord looks like something you\u2019d find in a dollar store, but you can easily hide it behind a nightstand.\nKey specs:\n- Colors/finishes: This lamp comes with a white shade only, and you can choose from brass or nickel-plated finishes for the stand.\n- Switch style: pull chain\n- Dimensions: 22 by 9 inches (height by width; base diameter is 6 inches)\n- Additional styles/sizes: floor lamp and corded sconce\n- Warranty/return policy: 180-day returns (one year if unboxed)\n- Bulb/socket type: E26, not included\nCheap and convenient: Yarra-Decor Bedside Table Lamp with USB Ports\nThis lamp is a multitasker. We had doubts about the Yarra-Decor Bedside Table Lamp with USB Port, but we gave it a shot due to its more than 28,000 largely positive Amazon reviews. After keeping it on a particularly small bedside table for several weeks, we think it's a hardworking little lamp. Each model has two USB ports, so you can charge a phone along with a tablet, e-reader, or any other USB-powered device that you keep near the bed. The Yarra-Decor also comes in many different shades and base finishes. We ordered the \u201cFabric\u201d option, which came with a shade reminiscent of a classic linen style and a base made from metal but covered with a wood-pattern laminate.\nIt\u2019s budget-friendly. The price fluctuates between $22 and $35, based on the color and finish. It often drops to $20, and we\u2019ve seen it as low as $18. Given this lamp\u2019s low cost, we\u2019re not sure how long it will last. But as of this guide\u2019s publish date, we\u2019ve been using it for four months with no problems.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThe base we tested looks as cheap as the price. We hardly expected mahogany, but a slightly darker \u201cfinish\u201d on the wood-patterned laminate would go a long way toward making this look a bit more sophisticated.\nKey specs:\n- Colors/finishes: There are 13 options in a variety of materials.\n- Switch style: touch base\n- Dimensions: 15 by 5\u00bd inches (height by width; base diameter: 4.7 inches)\n- Warranty/return policy: 30-day returns via Amazon\n- Bulb/socket type: E26; included\nCheap, reliable, and cute: Threshold Assembled Ceramic Table Lamp-Blue\nIt comes from a reliably good source. One of Target\u2019s in-house brands, Threshold (along with Threshold designed with Studio McGee) has long been a great go-to for inexpensive lamps. The Threshold Assembled Ceramic Table Lamp Blue is described as \u201cabstract\u201d by the company, but we see repeated patterns in a jewel-tone blue on a cream-colored background. This lamp\u2019s base has a satisfying heft for the low price point. Like all models from Target Owned Brands, this lamp comes with a generous one-year return policy, even if it has been used.\nIt should have a long shelf life. My current bedside lamp is another simple Threshold design that\u2019s just the right height and fits on my nightstand with plenty of room to spare. And it provides just enough light for me to read by without disturbing my husband. I\u2019ve used it since 2018 without any issues.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nPrecision isn\u2019t a strong suit. Sometimes the paint jobs on Threshold\u2019s ceramic models wander outside the lines. If you\u2019re picky, we suggest you see these lamps in person to make sure there aren\u2019t any faults before buying. We\u2019re also not fans of the socket switch, but we\u2019ll make an exception for an inexpensive and reliable lamp.\nNot all Threshold lamps are created equal. Although we\u2019re a fan of Threshold lamps in general, they come in a wide range of styles and materials, and not all models are winners. In our experience, tall, skinny options don\u2019t typically have strong bases, and they can wobble (or, worse, topple) when you\u2019re switching them on and off in bed.\nKey specs:\n- Colors/finishes: It comes in just one.\n- Switch style: rotary switch on the socket\n- Dimensions: 17\u00bd by 9 inches (height by width; base diameter: 6\u00bc inches)\n- Additional styles/sizes: none (But the Threshold line has lots of other models.)\n- Warranty/return policy: one-year return policy for all Threshold items with a receipt (and any other Target Owned Brands)\n- Bulb/socket type: E26\nWhat about vintage lamps?\nEvery interior designer we spoke with brought up rewiring vintage lamps as a way to get something truly unique to your taste, as well as to extend the life of a beloved family lamp.\nThis Old House offers a thorough tutorial on rewiring, and there are many videos on YouTube that walk you through the process. Lamp-rewiring kits are plentiful online, and you can upgrade or personalize your find with a cloth-covered or twisted cord. If you find a beautiful vintage lamp with an annoying switch, you can see whether it\u2019s compatible with a smart bulb; if so, you could control the lamp with your phone or even set up automated schedules.\nWhat to look forward to\nWe\u2019d hoped to include more corded sconces, but many were not up to snuff, and one was discontinued after we ordered it. We plan to update this guide with more options, and we\u2019re looking into two models from Schoolhouse (the Allegheny and the Issac) as well as the Rejuvenation Lilith Single Sconce.\nThe competition\nThis is not a comprehensive list of everything we\u2019ve tested in previous iterations of this guide\u2014 just what\u2019s still available.\nThe Crate & Kids Pixie Metal and Wood Kids\u2019 Swivel Plug-In Wall Sconce would be great if it weren\u2019t for a fatal flaw\u2014the cord sticks out slightly from the back, preventing a fully flush mount against the wall. We hoped it might just be a defect with our lamp, but we saw reviews on the site reporting the same issue. (We also saw other reviewers claiming their lamps were just fine.)\nWe like the idea of a clip-on lamp for headboards, so we looked at the IKEA Ranarp Wall/Clamp Spotlight, which can be mounted either as a corded sconce or as a clamp. But the clamp isn\u2019t strong enough to stay in place unless you also attach some confusing additional hardware. A clamp should be able to clamp.\nWe used to recommend the Loftie Lamp, but with a recent tariff-related price increase of 65% we think you\u2019re better off using a smart bulb inside a regular lamp if you\u2019re interested in a bedside light that changes colors. Plus, three of our long term testers experienced various glitches with the Loftie turning on and off at random. To the company\u2019s credit, they were transparent about the price increase and gave consumers advance warning that it was coming via emails and social media ads.\nThe inexpensive ONEWISH Touch Bedside Lamp has a cute genie-bottle-shaped base and three touch-toggle settings. But the shade, which comes rolled in a tube and attaches via Velcro and plastic clips, looks terribly cheap. And, annoyingly, the dimming function toggles from low to high. But if you don\u2019t mind that, you can easily swap out the shade for a new one (an inexpensive option from Target will do), and you\u2019ll have a nice-looking lamp at a good price.\nIn photos, we thought the milky glass finish on the West Elm Cleo would provide enough light diffusion to meet our criteria. But we could clearly see lines from the recommended T9L bulb through it, and we found the white glare too strong for bedside use. This detail might not bother some, though, and this is a cute lamp that comes in three shade colors.\nThis guide was edited by Daniela Gorny and Joanne Chen.\nSources\nNicholas Obeid, interior designer and product designer, video interview, May 1, 2024\nJessica Davis, interior designer and owner of Atelier Davis, phone interview, May 1, 2024\nShannon Maldonado, founder and creative director of Yowie, phone interview, April 26, 2024\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "The Best Light Therapy Lamp\nShifts in the number of daylight hours\u2014due to changing seasons or long-distance travel\u2014can have varying effects on people. For some, limited daylight hours can sap energy. For others, the effects can be more serious.\nAfter putting in 33 hours of research\u2014including reading two books and five comprehensive studies on the subject and interviewing one of the scientists who discovered seasonal affective disorder (SAD)\u2014we\u2019ve concluded that the Carex Day-Light Classic Plus is the best light therapy lamp to treat SAD symptoms.\nWhat to look for\n- 10,000 lux\nThe more light a lamp can safely deliver, the less time you need to use it. Thirty minutes in front of a 10,000-lux lamp is generally sufficient.\n- Sitting distance\nThe farther a person can sit from a lamp and still receive the stated 10,000 lux, the easier it is to position.\nAlthough many people might catch a case of the blahs when the weather turns colder and the days get shorter, that\u2019s far different from a clinical case of SAD, which should only be diagnosed and treated by a medical professional. You should use a SAD lamp or light box only under medical supervision, as it is in fact a medical device.\nThe Carex Day-Light Classic Plus meets all of the criteria necessary to be considered therapeutically effective and safe, and it\u2019s cheaper than many of its competitors. The lamp\u2019s \u201c99.3 percent UV-free\u201d LED light and 10,000-lux light intensity at 12 inches, combined with its large, 15\u00bd-by-12\u00bd-inch face, mean you won\u2019t have to sit in front of it for more than 30 minutes (the minimum length of time that experts recommend) to experience its physiological benefits. It has a color temperature of 4,000 Kelvin.\nIf you\u2019re willing to pay a bit more for one of the sleekest large light therapy lamps we looked at, or if our pick is unavailable, we recommend the Northern Light Technologies Boxelite. With a minimalist, rectangular design, the Boxelite is the lamp we\u2019d like to put on our own desks. Its light face is about the same size as that of our top pick (15 by 12 inches), and it provides 10,000 lux of fluorescent, \u201cUV-free\u201d light at 14 inches (two more than our top pick). The Boxelite also has a warmer color temperature (3,500 Kelvin) than our top pick, which may better suit your taste. As with our top pick, you have to sit in front of it for only 30 minutes to benefit. But the Boxelite isn\u2019t adjustable, unlike the Day-Light Classic Plus.\nAt nearly half the price and a quarter of the size of our top pick, the Verilux HappyLight Luxe provides 10,000 lux of \u201cUV-free\u201d LED light at six inches, according to the manufacturer. Its 9-by-6-inch light surface has three color temperatures to choose from (3,500, 4,250, and 5,000 Kelvin, more choices than on our top pick or our also-great model), and it comes with a useful countdown timer. However, it isn\u2019t position-adjustable like our top pick, and its small overall size and light face mean you may need to get creative with positioning to ensure an effective angle during use. And in a side-by-side comparison using a commercial luxmeter, we found that the HappyLight Luxe\u2019s light appeared less powerful than that of our other two picks.\nThe research\n- Why you should trust us\n- What is seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?\n- Who should (and should not) get this\n- How light therapy lamps work\n- How we picked and tested\n- Our pick: Carex Day-Light Classic Plus\n- Also great: Northern Light Technologies Boxelite\n- Budget pick: Verilux HappyLight Luxe\n- Another light therapy lamp worth considering\n- The competition\n- Sources\nWhy you should trust us\nWe looked at 50 lamps for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and eventually tested 15 top-rated best sellers. We spent a weekend reading Winter Blues by SAD expert Norman E. Rosenthal, MD, and spoke at length with Alfred Lewy, MD, PhD, one of the first doctors to report on SAD in 1980. We also reached out to psychologist Elizabeth Saenger, PhD, who was then the director of education for the Center for Environmental Therapeutics, and Teodor Postolache, MD, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Additionally, we read through many research papers from the past three decades.\nWhat is seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?\nMany people experience some emotional or physical changes with the arrival of new seasons, especially winter: Your mood may swing, your eating habits might shift, and your energy levels may rise or fall. Some people are less able to cope with these changes. SAD is a seasonal pattern of major depressive episodes as diagnosed by a physician according to criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (per DSM-5, SAD is a form of depression called \u201cMajor Depressive Disorder with Seasonal Pattern.\u201d). This diagnosis can be made only by a medical professional.\nFor many people, seasonal shifts in their mood and energy might be unpleasant or annoying, but they\u2019re fairly simple to manage.\nOther people feel the weight of these changes in a more serious manner. Maybe the symptoms aren\u2019t quite severe enough for them to seek a doctor\u2019s opinion, but the effects certainly make it hard to get out of the house in winter. It\u2019s what folks sometimes informally call the winter blues.\nA third group experiences these changes so severely that their lives are seriously disrupted. If you have true SAD, the darker months may feel like a physical exhaustion that will never end.\nIt\u2019s important to note that not everyone experiences SAD symptoms at the same time or in the same way. In Winter Blues, Rosenthal writes, \u201cJust as the degree of seasonal difficulties may vary from one person to the next, so may the timing of the problem. For example, one person may begin to feel SAD symptoms in September, whereas another will feel well until after Christmas.\u201d\nWho should (and should not) get this\nTherapeutic light boxes are not the only available treatment for seasonal affective disorder (SAD). If you think you\u2019re among the roughly 5% in the United States who suffer from SAD, talk to your doctor to figure out your best course of treatment (which might include anything from more time outside to cognitive behavioral therapy or medication).\nFor most people with only mild seasonal mood disorders, the risk of using a therapy light is relatively minimal; eyestrain and headaches (especially in migraine sufferers) are the most commonly reported side effects. However, people with a history of bipolar disorder may suffer an exaggerated response while using a light box and should consider this therapy only in close consultation with a physician.\nHow light therapy lamps work\nIn 1980, Alfred Lewy published the finding from a small study indicating that sufficiently intense artificial light suppressed humans\u2019 nighttime production of melatonin\u2014a hormone linked to the regulation of the sleep cycle. According to interviews with Lewy, prior to that moment there was more or less uniform agreement among medical professionals that artificial light had little to no effect on people\u2019s circadian rhythms. As it turned out, most experiments up to that moment had not used lights bright enough to induce a measurable change in human melatonin or circadian physiology.\n\u201c[Dr. Robert] Sack and I realized that humans really don\u2019t have seasonal rhythms like animals do, like breeding and hibernation and reproduction,\u201d Lewy explained over the phone. \u201cWe proposed a \u2018phase shift hypothesis\u2019 that is still the leading hypothesis for how bright lights treat SAD, which is that in the winter, with the shorter days, most people\u2019s circadian rhythms drift late with the later dawn, out of phase with their natural sleep-wake cycle. It\u2019s like having jet lag for five months. With morning bright-light exposure, those rhythms are pushed back earlier, back into phase with their sleep.\u201d\nToday, \u201cbright light therapy is recommended as the first-line option\u201d for the treatment of SAD, according to a 2003 review (PDF) in the journal Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience. Far from being a fringe or \u201calternative\u201d purported remedy for SAD, light therapy has been clinically shown in many studies to work to alleviate symptoms.\nHow we picked and tested\nWhen you\u2019re shopping for a SAD lamp, to ensure that you receive the full therapeutic benefits of the light, there are a few important factors to consider, namely how much light it delivers and how close to the lamp you need to sit for the treatment to be effective.\nFirst, know that the FDA does not regulate light-box devices. As such, you should not use one without a physician\u2019s guidance. We based our picks on research, customer feedback, and product specifications\u2014including optimal sitting distances\u2014provided by manufacturers, as well as conversations with experts who study and prescribe these units.\nA light box should deliver between 2,500 and 10,000 lux. A lux is a unit that measures 1 lumen per square meter. The more lux a light delivers, the less time you need to spend positioned in front of it. For most 10,000-lux lights, 30 uninterrupted minutes per day, preferably in the morning, should suffice. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to sleep too early and want to stay awake longer, a little bit of light therapy in the afternoon can help mitigate that,\u201d said Teodore Postolache, PhD, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nWe also looked at how close to each box you need to sit to score the maximum results. Light intensity is subject to the inverse square law, which says that the intensity of light falls off by the square of the distance that you move away from it. For instance, if you are 2 feet away from a light source, you see a fourfold decrease in intensity. The farther away a person is able to sit from a lamp and still receive 10,000 lux for maximum efficacy, the more flexibility they have in terms of what they can be doing and how they can be sitting during treatment. \u201cI insist, absolutely, that any reputable, reliable manufacturer has to tell the consumer what the distance it should be from the eyes to achieve 10,000 lux,\u201d Lewy said. \u201cIf a light box doesn\u2019t have that information, I wouldn\u2019t use it.\u201d\nThe larger the surface of the light box, the better. In Winter Blues, Rosenthal notes that the lights \u201cused in almost all research studies \u2026 have an illuminated surface that is at least about one foot square.\u201d For that reason, and the fact that smaller therapeutic lamps have not undergone the same kind of rigorous study that their bigger cousins have received, we strongly recommend light boxes with the largest surfaces. (We do recommend a smaller lamp, the HappyLight Luxe, which we think is a serviceable option if you don\u2019t have the space or budget for one of our larger picks. However, our top pick has a longer track record of efficacy in home and academic use, and in a side-by-side comparison that we performed with a commercial luxmeter, the HappyLight Luxe\u2019s light output did not seem as strong.)\nWe avoided any lamps that did not have a plastic filter to remove most if not all ultraviolet waves (which are potentially harmful to the eye), and we avoided those with incandescent bulbs, which can build up a lot of heat, as well as models that used blue LEDs, as there\u2019s still some controversy over whether blue light, which is different from blue-enriched white light (PDF), is harmful to the eyes.\nAlthough many SAD lamps fit the above specifications, we discounted a number of them because of their high price, overly cumbersome design, too-small size, or dubious claims about features like \u201cion therapy.\u201d\nBecause we are not qualified or equipped to evaluate SAD lamps for efficacy, we focused instead on how easy they were to use, how much space they took up on a tabletop, and whether they met their stated specs, including their total size and weight, light-face dimensions, cord lengths, and approximate light intensities. In a nonscientific test, we compared lux readings obtained with a commercial luxmeter to check for any significant inconsistencies between stated light intensities and real-world readings.\nFor this review, we focused on light therapy lamps. We did not consider dawn simulators, sunrise alarm clocks, or so-called light therapy glasses.\nOur pick: Carex Day-Light Classic Plus\nThe Carex Day-Light Classic Plus has the largest light face of all our picks and an impressive record of efficacy, as reported in customer reviews and academic research alike. At a distance of 12 inches, this lamp projects 10,000 lux of \u201c99.3 percent UV-free\u201d LED light from its 15\u00bd-by-12\u00bd-inch lamp face, the same amount of lux as all of our other picks provide and the minimum lux that any SAD lamp needs to be therapeutically effective according to the doctors we interviewed. The lamp face mounts to a weighted horseshoe base by way of an adjustable arm. This arm allows you to adjust the lamp\u2019s angle and vertical position, reducing overall glare and increasing the flexibility of where and how you can use the lamp. For instance, you can set up the Day-Light Classic Plus in such a way that it allows you to read a book beneath it while keeping most of your face positioned well within the therapeutic 12-inch range of the lamp face. In contrast, to read in front of lamps that sit directly on a desk, you would need to either place the book upright between you and the lamp, which would shield you from some of the light, or lay the book down in front of you, possibly extending your position outside of the lamp\u2019s therapeutic range.\nAssembling the Day-Light Classic Plus is easy and takes less than five minutes. An on/off switch on its side powers the lamp; when switched on, it starts illuminating instantly, in one of two intensities (7,000 or 10,000 lux). Fully extended, the Day-Light Classic Plus is 28\u00bd inches tall. The lamp angle can swing approximately 65 degrees from fully vertical to nearly horizontal, which adds flexibility, though this design makes the entire lamp more cumbersome to move around compared with other lamps we\u2019ve tried.\nCompared with the cooler tones of other lamps, the Day-Light Classic Plus emits a pleasant, warm light with a color temperature of 4,000 Kelvin. You can also adjust the intensity, choosing between a high setting (10,000 lux) and a low setting (7,000 lux). Unlike on our also-great pick, this model\u2019s cover, which protects the LED lights, creates an airtight seal, which makes the lamp easier to keep clean. The lamp comes with a standard AWG 6-foot grounded power cord, which is plenty long enough for most people\u2019s needs and interchangeable if it gets lost. That interchangeability also means you can buy a longer AWG cord and use that instead if you need to.\nThe Day-Light has been used for years by scientists and physicians who study and treat SAD. The Center for Environmental Therapeutics, a nonprofit collective of scientists and clinicians dedicated to research and education about environmental therapies, previously recommended the Day-Light for years. According to psychologist Elizabeth Saenger, who was the CET\u2019s director of education at the time of our interview, it\u2019s the go-to light for many clinical trials that aim to study the effectiveness of light therapy. In October 2017, former CET board member Dorothy K. Sit, MD, and her colleagues used the Day-Light in a study described in an American Journal of Psychiatry paper, \u201cAdjunctive Bright Light Therapy for Bipolar Depression: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial.\u201d A January 2016 article in New York Magazine also touted the Day-Light Classic Plus, quoting psychiatrist James Phelps\u2019s description of it as the \u201cofficial research rig.\u201d\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThe Day-Light Classic Plus is unwieldy and, some would argue, unattractive. The weighted base has a large (12-by-16-inch) footprint, so this lamp is not ideal for smaller spaces. If you don\u2019t like the way it looks, you may prefer the simpler design of our also-great pick or our compact budget pick.\nLike any heat-producing device, the lamp should be used in an open, ventilated space (a company spokesperson said to avoid putting it on a desk with a hutch, for example).\nCarex\u2019s five-year warranty for the Day-Light Classic Plus does not apply to \u201cuse other than for personal, family or household purposes and excludes shipping and handling charges.\u201d\nAlso great: Northern Light Technologies Boxelite\nIf design is your priority, we like the Northern Light Technologies Boxelite. This lamp is more expensive than our top pick but looks the sharpest on a desk or table. Similar to the Day-Light Classic Plus, the Boxelite provides 10,000 lux at a distance of 14 inches, and it emits light from a 15-by-12-inch face. According to Northern Light Technologies, the light is fully UV-free, a slight enhancement over our top pick\u2019s \u201c99.3% UV-free\u201d claim. The Boxelite provides an even warmer light than the Day-Light Classic Plus, with a 3,500-Kelvin color temperature. The Boxelite is not adjustable, but its slim, basic design helps it look the least obtrusive of the lamps we considered.\nAn on/off switch at the base powers the lamp. The bulbs take a few seconds to illuminate, but that is normal for fluorescent bulbs. The lamp also comes with a 7-foot cord, the longest of any of our picks.\nOur favorite aspect of the Boxelite is its sleek design. The Boxelite has a picture-frame setup, minimal design with few accents, and clean edges. The back of the Boxelite is contained in a single smooth, black panel. It also comes with a seven-year warranty, longer coverage than for our pick. Note, though, that this warranty (PDF) covers everything but the tubes, and the customer is responsible for the shipping costs to send faulty units to Northern Light Technologies.\nOur main two issues with the Boxelite are its lack of adjustability and its higher price, although it does come with that seven-year warranty. Also, since the Boxelite\u2019s plastic cover does not feature an airtight seal (unlike on our other two picks), dust and grime easily slip into the hard-to-clean space between the cover and the lights.\nBudget pick: Verilux HappyLight Luxe\nIn side-by-side comparisons, the light output of the Verilux HappyLight Luxe was significantly lower than that of our other two picks. However, this small lamp is a solid option for newcomers to light therapy who don\u2019t have the space or the budget for our top pick or also-great pick. At less than a foot tall and 7\u00bd inches wide, it also packs easily for travel. The HappyLight Luxe\u2019s 9-by-6-inch light surface still shines brightly, though not as brightly as those on our other, larger picks. According to Verilux, the lamp\u2019s claimed 10,000-lux, \u201cUV-free\u201d light projection is adjustable from 3,500 to 5,000 Kelvin, so you can pick the light warmth that feels best to you.\nHowever, the 10,000-lux is only feasible at a distance of six inches, which is half that of our other picks.\nThis model also features a countdown timer that lets you set the lamp to stay on for five-minute increments up to an hour; when the timer is done, the lamp shuts off automatically.\nThe HappyLight Luxe has the appearance and approximate size of a Kindle or a tablet, and unlike our other two picks, it comes with a detachable stand that can also serve as a wall mount. Its small footprint makes it easy to adjust and move around for proper, effective placement and for making sure it is within the company-reported therapeutic 24-inch range of the lamp face, which is twice the distance allowed by our top pick.\nLike the cover on the Day-Light Classic Plus, the HappyLight Luxe\u2019s cover, which protects the LED lights, has an airtight seal, so the lamp is easy to keep clean. The HappyLight Luxe comes with a three-year warranty that excludes bulbs and parts, which are covered by only a 60-day warranty. Registering a lamp buys an additional year of warranty coverage.) At 67 inches long, the cord on this model is shorter than those of the Day-Light Classic Plus and the Boxelite.\nAnother light therapy lamp worth considering\nIf you dislike the flat, rectangular light surfaces of most SAD lamps: Consider the cylindrical Bright Health 24-Inch Light Therapy Lamp. It emits the same 10,000 lux of 4,000 Kelvin light at a distance of 12 inches and is covered by the same five-year warranty as the Carex Day-Light Classic Plus. Yet it has a smaller overall footprint and feels far less clunky in our living space. \u201cWhile most devices have a broader surface to reduce glare and increase comfort, the main issue is whether people will use it routinely,\u201d said Dr. Jamie M. Zeitzer, a co-director at Stanford University\u2019s Center for Sleep and Circadian Sciences. Some users may find the cylindrical design difficult to look at or to position in a way to get the enhanced light, but \u201cif the cylindrical design makes the user feel better about having it out in the abode, then that\u2019s great.\u201d (The Bright Health lamp also comes in a 14-inch-tall version, but we think most people will find the taller lamp easier to position for maximum efficacy.)\nThe competition\nIf our top pick is unavailable, or if space is a concern, consider the Carex Day-Light Sky, which is a slightly smaller version of the Day-Light Classic Plus. Both have a long neck and swivel head for custom positioning. The Day-Light Sky\u2019s base is teal.\nFor smaller spaces, Carex's TheraLite Aura is a serviceable budget option with a reported 10,000-lux output at 12 inches. Its overall footprint is less than half the size of our top pick\u2019s; its light surface, in particular, is significantly smaller. This lamp is also less adjustable, allowing only repositioning of the light surface\u2019s upward/downward angle (you cannot change the height). The smaller size and reduced adjustability limit your positioning options.\nThe compact Carex TheraLite is less expensive than our budget pick, but it\u2019s nearly half the size. Its 3,000 Kelvin color temperature also isn\u2019t adjustable.\nWe chose not to test the compact Amazon Basics Light Therapy Lamp (currently unavailable) due to middling reviews.\nIn 2020, Carex came out with three new TheraLite lamps, all of which reportedly project 10,000 lux of light and have interesting features, but their one-year warranties aren\u2019t competitive with our picks\u2019 longer coverage periods. The Halo includes Qi wireless cell phone charging and six levels of brightness, while the Radiance includes a built-in alarm clock plus Qi wireless cell phone charging and five levels of brightness. The Aura Qi is an updated version of the Aura and includes a built-in alarm clock plus Qi wireless cell phone charging and four levels of brightness. In our tests, however, after 30 minutes of use it became very hot to the touch, reaching 110 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe Verilux HappyLight Full-Size (VT20) is about the same price as our budget pick but lacks a countdown timer.\nThe Circadian Optics Lumine Light Therapy Lamp is extremely small, with a light surface of only 6 by 6 inches, which makes it difficult to achieve the optimal distance for therapeutic benefit.\nNorthern Light Technologies\u2019s Boxelite-OS seemed like a promising alternative to the comparatively clinical-looking Carex Day-Light Classic Plus, but we found its two-legged adjustable design unwieldy. We also discovered that the light surface quickly collected dust and put off a considerable amount of heat (including for quite a while after we had switched the light off). The Day-Light Classic Plus, which we tested in a side-by-side comparison with the Boxelite-OS, seemed to produce much less heat when it was on and became cool to the touch just moments after we switched it off. Although both models have rather large footprints, we found it easier to position a laptop beneath the Day-Light Classic Plus than under the Boxelite-OS, especially within a small workspace.\nThe Aura Daylight Therapy Lamp, which regularly costs more than our top pick, has a streamlined design like our also-great pick\u2019s with a slightly smaller footprint. Although it\u2019s typically less expensive than the Boxelite, you need to sit much closer to this lamp to receive 10,000 lux of light, the manufacturer says (positioning yourself no more than 8 inches away from the light surface). The Aura Daylight also has a shorter warranty period\u2014two years\u2014than our picks.\nThe Sphere Gadget Technologies Lightphoria (currently unavailable), a best seller on Amazon, is too small to provide enough of an illuminated surface.\nWe dismissed the Travelite and the Luxor, both by Northern Light Technologies, for their smaller light panels and lesser reviews, respectively. The company\u2019s Flamingo lamp, affixed to a 4-foot-tall floor stand, regularly costs more than twice as much as our top pick and almost $100 more than our also-great pick.\nAlthough the Alaska Northern Lights NorthStar 10,000 meets the recommended criteria for a light therapy lamp and has excellent customer reviews, at a typical price of $300 it costs over two times as much as our top pick.\nThis article was edited by Tracy Vence and Kalee Thompson.\nSources\nAlfred Lewy, MD, PhD, director, Sleep and Mood Disorders Laboratory at Oregon Health & Science University, phone interview\nElizabeth Saenger, PhD, director of education at the Center for Environmental Therapeutics, phone interview\nTeodor Postolache, MD, professor of psychiatry, University of Maryland School of Medicine, phone interview\nJamie M.

      "text": "The Best Desk Lamps\nA great desk lamp can transform your workspace \u2014 both functionally and aesthetically. It can reduce eye fatigue and help you better see what you\u2019re working on, and it can set the right mood for getting work done. A great lamp can also be a design statement.\nAfter researching over 55 desk lamps and testing 20, we\u2019ve chosen our favorite desk lamps in a variety of styles and prices.\nHow we picked\n- LED vs. incandescent\nWe favored built-in LEDs and LED bulbs, due to their long lifespan and, in some cases, adjustable color temperature.\n- Power switches\nWe like when power switches are on the lamp (not on the cord), so it\u2019s easier to turn them on and off.\n- Dim the lights\nWe preferred lamps that let us adjust the brightness levels (and made it intuitive to do so).\n- Good design\nWe wanted lamps that would look good on any desk, complement different decor styles, and last a lifetime.\nEverything we recommend\nThe research\n- A miniature, modern, minimalist lamp that bends to your will: Koncept Z-Bar Mini Desk Lamp\n- A color-customizable task lamp that doubles as a bedside light: Gantri Analog Task Light\n- A back-to-the-basics, all-steel desk lamp built to last a lifetime: Schoolhouse Joe Task Lamp\n- A space-saving and energy-efficient lamp with a long reach: Uplift LED Desk Lamp E7 With Clamp\n- An intuitive LED desk lamp: Humanscale Nova\n- A classic architect-style lamp: IKEA Fors\u00e5 Work Lamp\n- A classic adjustable shade lamp: Article Leap Table Lamp\n- A tall, slender desk lamp with hands-free controls: Tangram Desk Lamp Aether\n- Other desk lamps worth considering\n- Who should get this\n- Why you should trust us\n- How we picked and tested\n- The competition\nA miniature, modern, minimalist lamp that bends to your will: Koncept Z-Bar Mini Desk Lamp\nGet this if: You want a desk lamp with a minimal footprint, a modern design, and the flexibility to position light nearly anywhere across a small work surface.\nWhy it\u2019s great: The Koncept Z-Bar Mini Desk Lamp is a compact desk lamp aimed at minimalists willing to pay a premium for sleek, contemporary design. Free of a spring-arm mechanism or light shade and consisting of just three slim articulating arms engineered to hinge and twist at a full 360 degrees, its simple-looking design disguises a satisfying degree of utility. Whether you\u2019re working behind a computer, reading a book, or reviewing paperwork, it dependably provides glare-free lighting.\nThe lamp\u2019s 10-inch stretch of 28 LEDs can be securely aimed across numerous positions without any of the drift or snap back that sometimes affects spring-arm lamps. That means you can position the Z-Bar Mini close to a piece of paper if you need help reading the fine print, or you can move it all the way up to 2 feet above your desk to illuminate the entire work surface.\nThe Z-Bar Mini is intuitive and satisfying to use thanks to the lamp\u2019s subtly concave touch strip controls, which provide a pleasing tactility that most capacitive adjustments lack. Adjusting the light\u2019s brightness feels like playing a slide guitar of light \u2014 brightness adjustments are smooth and instantaneous, and they\u2019re easy to use with touch alone. If you\u2019re on video calls regularly, you\u2019ll come to appreciate being able to set up the light in a 3-foot-tall vertical configuration, which results in a soft, glare-free glow that makes all sides your best side.\nAdditionally, Koncept offers an updated Gen 4 version of the Z-Bar Mini alongside a Gen 4 Pro edition, which might be worth considering if you\u2019re willing to part with a few more dollars. The former has a wider color temperature range (3,500 to 5,000 kelvins) and reduced energy consumption. The latter adds slightly brighter LEDs, an occupancy sensor, a warmer 2,700 K color temperature setting, and a USB port for charging devices. The hinge connecting the base to the middle arm also features a more elegantly integrated mechanism, free of the visible hardware that slightly mars the linear design of the original.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIt\u2019s expensive for its size. Despite its diminutive stature, the Z-Bar Mini is still a significant investment at over $300. Koncept also sells refurbished models for about $262.\nYou need both hands to make some adjustments. The primary hinge mechanism connecting the base to the arm offers secure positioning, but it tends to stick and slightly lift the base when adjusted upward.\nThe power cord feels chintzy compared with the rest of the lamp. The standard black plastic power cord belies the Z-Bar Mini\u2019s overall aspirational design package.\nKey specs\n- Dimensions: 12.7-by-25.65-inch arm (fully extended) with a 7.5-inch diameter base\n- LED bulb included: yes\n- Brightness levels: continuous dimming\n- Color temperature: 4,500 K (cool) and 3,500 K (warm)\n- Phone charging: no\n- Wattage: 6.5 W max\n- Warranty: five years\nA color-customizable task lamp that doubles as a bedside light: Gantri Analog Task Light\nGet this if: You want a compact light that can squarely fit into the role of a desk lamp or bedside lamp.\nWhy it\u2019s great: The Gantri Analog Task Light is the desk lamp we\u2019d give to friends who complain that \u201cevery desk lamp looks the same!\u201d It\u2019s compact and cleverly adjustable, with an offbeat, Lego-inspired design that comes in a wide array of colors (29 in total). It\u2019s also bright enough for real work \u2014 proof that functional lighting can also be fun \u2014 but could just as easily function as an illuminating bedside companion.\nJust like our previous pick from Gantri, the Analog light is made to order and 3D-printed from a plant-based polymer. You might think that a 16-inch-tall, 4-inch-wide plastic lamp might be too light and too unstable, but the Analog light has been designed with a hefty base that gives it a surprisingly stable footprint. A set of four rubber pads on the bottom further enhance the lamp\u2019s stability.\nWhile the five stacked blocks that make up the lamp cannot be individually color-customized, Gantri offers three \u201cCreator\u2019s Choice\u201d color combinations in addition to 26 other single-color designs. You should be able to find an option that matches or (tastefully) clashes with your workspace.\nA hidden friction hinge lets the square head swivel a full 320 degrees without drooping, so you can aim the beam at a keyboard, bounce it off a wall for mood light, or park it straight up at the ceiling like a tiny spotlight.\nGantri includes an E12 dimmable LED bulb (6.4 W, 2,700 K, 600 lumens), so you won\u2019t have to hunt for specialty bulbs if you want to swap to a different color temperature or need to replace a dead bulb. (A confident tap along the back end of the diffuser is all it takes to pop open the bulb compartment.)\nThe included bulb isn\u2019t super-bright at its highest setting, but it is more than sufficient for emails and sketchpads alike. You can dial in brightness from a soft night-light to a bright study lamp with a slippery swipe of Gantri\u2019s signature chunky in-line dimmer.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThe included bulb could be brighter. The replaceable E12 LED bulb that ships with the Analog light is on the warmer end of the spectrum at 2,700 K, and at 6 W it\u2019s noticeably dimmer than our other picks at max brightness. But that\u2019s a big part of why this lamp is suited for double duty as a desk lamp and bedside lamp. And because the bulb is replaceable, you can switch it out for a brighter option.\nYou\u2019re paying a premium for eco-friendly materials, made-to-order colors, and boutique design. Some people don\u2019t mind splurging on such a unique-looking lamp, but if you\u2019re after sheer lumens per dollar, you can find better options.\nWe wish the dimmer switch had some texture. Gantri outfits all its lamps with a large, all-white dimmer switch finished in a glossy plastic. The lack of texture makes it all too easy for your thumb to slide across its surface without activating its dimmer control.\nKey specs\n- Dimensions: 16 by 4 by 8 inches\n- LED bulb included: replaceable E12 (6 W, 2,700 K)\n- Brightness levels: continuous dimming\n- Color temperature: 2,700 K\n- Phone charging: no\n- Wattage: 6 W max\n- Warranty: three years\nA back-to-the-basics, all-steel desk lamp built to last a lifetime: Schoolhouse Joe Task Lamp\nGet this if: You appreciate the heft of an all-steel lamp that looks and feels like it could outlast the lifespan of an LED bulb, and you don\u2019t need or want anything but a reliable desk light.\nWhy it\u2019s great: The Schoolhouse Joe Task Lamp is a retro-modern counterpart to another one of our picks, the Gantri Analog Task Light; they share a similar offset swivel-head design suited to small desks. But where the Gantri light is made of lightweight bioplastic and designed to satisfy a modernist aesthetic, the Joe Task Lamp is built from heavy-duty all-steel parts, so it could outlast several owners.\nAnd though you might think such a vertically oriented lamp is easy to tip over, the Joe Task Lamp\u2019s all-metal construction alongside its circular base gives the lamp the immovable stability of a sumo wrestler after dinner.\nThe Joe Task Lamp is designed to operate with the reliable simplicity of a lamp your parents \u2014 or grandparents \u2014 might have owned, equipped with nothing new or extraneous to worry about breaking. That sense of durability extends to the lamp\u2019s on-off dial switch, which clicks with such mechanical confidence that you\u2019ll wish all dials would deliver such audible and tactile pleasure.\nIt comes in 21 gloss and satin hues and includes a handsome woven cloth power cord, but that\u2019s the extent of any new-school updates.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIt\u2019s not cheap, and it doesn\u2019t come with a bulb. At about $600, the Joe Task Lamp is quite pricey, and the asking price doesn\u2019t include the recommended $29 G16 bulb. And the lamp\u2019s narrow cylindrical shade means reaching in to screw or unscrew that required bulb can prove challenging for people with large hands.\nIts controls are basic. Its single brightness setting and non-dimmable output is unapologetically old school but can place undeniable limitations on where you might use it. However, if you\u2019re drawn to the Joe Task Lamp, you\u2019re likely to overlook these shortcomings in favor of its singular simplicity.\nKey specs\n- Dimensions: 20 by 8 by 6.5 inches to 23 by 8 by 7.375 inches\n- LED bulb included: none; requires G16 E26 bulb\n- Brightness levels: single setting; 250 lumens (using optional bulb)\n- Color temperature: 2,850 K (with optional bulb)\n- Phone charging: no\n- Wattage: 25 W max\n- Warranty: one year\nA space-saving and energy-efficient lamp with a long reach: Uplift LED Desk Lamp E7 With Clamp\nGet this if: You need a desk lamp that can adapt to different tasks throughout the day.\nWhy it\u2019s great: The Uplift LED Desk Lamp E7 With Clamp is a nearly perfect desk lamp considering its practicality and price: It\u2019s lightweight yet stable, affordable but not cheaply made, and slender but capable of stretching high and wide, to cast a glare-free and adjustable light wherever it\u2019s needed.\nThe E7 isn\u2019t going to win any style awards, but the lamp\u2019s rangy, simple design is unobtrusive and utilitarian. Because it clamps onto a desk\u2019s edge (an optional $20 desk base is available), it doesn\u2019t require a lot of space. And once it\u2019s assembled, its three-part adjustable aluminum arm can impressively reach \u2014 like an NBA center \u2014 up and outward, craning 34 inches up and 43 inches wide when fully outstretched. It took just a few minutes to assemble the lamp and secure the clamp to our desk, and it was easy to do.\nThe 11-by-1-inch LED assembly is sheathed in smooth aluminum and shines with up to 685 lumens, with an adjustable head that nods up or down in a 190-degree range of motion. We wished the lamp head could also rotate to each side, but the two lamp arms make up for this drawback with gymnast-like flexibility.\nThe first joint of articulation bends 110 degrees, and the second articulation point offers an even more limber 210 degrees, which allows for seemingly endless angles for the lamp to shine its light. Watch the video here to see more detail on how the lamp can be adjusted.\nIt doesn\u2019t have any app integration or smart programmable options, but in everyday use, the E7\u2019s simplicity proved to be a virtue, not a vice. The E7\u2019s controls are tasked to a single square button on the LED light bar, so you can make stepless dimming and brightness adjustments with a tap or long hold.\nIt took only a few uses for the controls to become an intuitive, \u201cLook ma, no glancing required\u201d motion. Uplift also makes our top-pick standing desk, so we know it\u2019s a reliable company (and if you happen to be shopping for a desk, you can usually find discounts when bundling accessories).\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIts clamp takes up some space. Because the clamp needs a 2-inch lip to attach to (adjustable up to 2.25-inch thickness), not all desks may be able to accommodate the desk attachment without having to be pulled away from a wall.\nSome adjustments are limited. The lamp can\u2019t tilt back at the base beyond a fixed angle, and the top arm can fling back with some velocity if positioned beyond 90 degrees.\nThe power switch is made of cheap plastic. This may or may not bother you, but it was noticeable in contrast with the metal used in the rest of the lamp\u2019s body.\nIts two-part power cord seems unnecessary. Unlike most desk lamps, this lamp includes a two-part power cord instead of one continuous length \u2014 which could create an unnecessary point of breakage and doesn\u2019t look as tidy.\nKey specs\n- Dimensions: 34 by 13.6 by 7.9 inches (see PDF for details)\n- LED bulb included: built-in\n- Brightness levels: adjustable (touch button)\n- Color temperature: 6,000 K (cool daylight)\n- Phone charging: none\n- Wattage: 9 W\n- Warranty: 15 years\nAn intuitive LED desk lamp: Humanscale Nova\nGet this if: You want a soft, glare-free, uniform light source that doesn\u2019t tire the eyes and can double as serviceable video-conference lighting.\nWhy it\u2019s great: The minimalist Humanscale Nova provides soft, uniform light without distracting glare, flickering, or harsh shadows \u2014 making it our favorite lamp for working in front of a computer. The lamp achieves this uniform pool of light by adding a diffuser lens over the LED array.\nThe Nova also has a touch-bar control running along its top arm, so dimming from 100% down to 14% brightness requires only an intuitive sliding motion, which we easily became accustomed to using without even a glance.\nA big reason we liked this lamp was its effortless, silent adjustability, which can easily be managed with one hand. The flat, 5-inch light head swings up and down and swivels nearly all the way around, so light can be aimed from varying heights and angles.\nWe were also impressed with the Nova\u2019s easy assembly. Just drop the preassembled arm and light head into the weighted desktop base, plug in the Nova, and it\u2019s ready to use.\nWhen stretching the lamp to its highest reach (nearly 29 inches), we could illuminate the majority of our 70-inch-long desk with only a gentle tapering of light at the far edges. But when we needed to focus light on an exacting task, we could pull the arms downward just above the desk to cast a shadow-free, even light.\nWe also appreciated the memory setting, which returns the Nova to its last-used brightness level, as well as a built-in energy-saving occupancy sensor, which turns the lamp off automatically when it\u2019s left alone. And if you\u2019re regularly logging onto video calls, you might appreciate the Nova\u2019s ability to soften harsh shadows when it\u2019s used at low-medium brightness.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIt\u2019s not as adjustable as we\u2019d prefer. Although it can reach far forward, the Nova\u2019s two-piece arm cannot tilt backward beyond a subtle angled position.\nThe energy-saving sensor can be finicky. The automatic on-off sensor failed us only once, when we were sitting still during a long reading session and had the lamp blocked with other items. But once we positioned the Nova normally, that never occurred again.\nThe optional charging base doesn\u2019t fit well with the lamp\u2019s minimalist design. The Nova is also available with a desk clamp, a wall mount, a cooler 4,000 K light, or with extended arms for even greater reach. You can also buy an optional charging desktop base equipped with two USB-A ports and Qi wireless charging, but that brings with it a second cord trailed by its own hefty power brick, giving the lamp an ugly pigtail. Unless you\u2019re in dire need of additional ports or power, skip this option.\nKey specs\n- Dimensions: 29 by 13 by 14 inches, with a 7.5-inch-diameter base\n- LED bulb included: built-in\n- Brightness levels: adjustable (touch button)\n- Color temperature: 3,000 K (warm)\n- Phone charging: optional add-on\n- Wattage: 7 W\n- Warranty: 10 years\nA classic architect-style lamp: IKEA Fors\u00e5 Work Lamp\nGet this if: You want a simple desk lamp with a replaceable bulb and an iconic design that suits most office decor.\nWhy it\u2019s great: The IKEA Fors\u00e5 Work Lamp is one of the most adjustable lamps we tested. It has three lamp-arm hinges, a tall spring-loaded arm that rotates 180 degrees, and a lamp head that rotates 360 degrees, so you can aim the light anywhere. The metal lamp also has a heavy base, which prevents toppling.\nUnlike many other lamps we tested, the IKEA Fors\u00e5 doesn\u2019t have a confusing touch interface to tap or to slide your fingers across \u2014 the cord has a simple on-off switch next to the base.\nIKEA has recently lowered the price of the Fors\u00e5 by $5, retaining the same specs of the previous model with one small but notable change: The LED bulb now must be purchased separately. IKEA recommends its Solhetta LED Bulb E12 in chandelier opal white.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nNot everyone liked the look of the lamp in a real-world setting. One tester said it looked clunky. The nickel-plated version has a nice finish, but it\u2019s also a fingerprint magnet.\nYou can\u2019t adjust brightness or color temperature. However, you can choose a bulb to suit your lighting preferences, up to 40 W. Previously IKEA included an E12 bulb, but the latest version of the Fors\u00e5 does not come with one.\nKey specs\n- Dimensions: 21 by 6 by 6 inches, with a round base\n- LED bulb included: none\n- Brightness levels: n/a\n- Color temperature: n/a\n- Phone charging: no\n- Wattage: 40 W max\n- Warranty: one year\nA classic adjustable shade lamp: Article Leap Table Lamp\nGet this if: You\u2019re after a mid-century-inspired desk lamp that looks more expensive than you\u2019d expect for its $90 price.\nWhy it\u2019s great: The Article Leap Table Lamp is an affordable, classy desk lamp that doesn\u2019t overcomplicate things. It features a matte, sculpted, crescent-shaped shade that swivels a full 360 degrees, and you can angle the head of the lamp about 30 degrees up and down. And this 20-inch-tall lamp\u2019s lone control is an on-off switch that\u2019s attached to the power cord, near the base. This simplicity, in design and function, is the Leap Table Lamp\u2019s charm.\nIts mid-century silhouette more than hints at the design of much pricier lamps by Serge Mouille, inspiration handsomely represented in the startlingly shiny copper arm and contrasting matte black shade and barbell-shaped base. The Leap Table Lamp adds to a room\u2019s ambiance whether it\u2019s on or off.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThe in-line rocker-switch control is the definition of basic. You won\u2019t find dimming or color-temperature options here.\nIt\u2019s fixed in its ways. The gracefully curved arm is welded in place, so you can\u2019t raise or lower the light \u2014 you can only pivot the shade from side to side and rotate it in a circular arc. For most desks that\u2019s fine, but tall owners who like to adjust task lighting vertically may want something more flexible.\nKey specs\n- Dimensions: 20 by 23 by 8 inches, with a round base\n- LED bulb included: E26 (4 W)\n- Brightness levels: one\n- Color temperature: 2,700 K (warm)\n- Phone charging: no\n- Wattage: 40 W max\n- Warranty: one year\nA tall, slender desk lamp with hands-free controls: Tangram Desk Lamp Aether\nGet this if: You work behind a big external monitor (or two) and want even, shadow-free light that clears the top of the screen.\nWhy it\u2019s great: The Tangram Desk Lamp Aether shares its slim-armed, highly adjustable design with two of our other top picks, the Koncept Z-Bar Mini Desk Lamp and the Humanscale Nova. But while the Z-Bar Mini is best suited for compact desks and laptops, and the Nova\u2019s flat 5-inch light head is most ideal for the average desk, the Aether goes taller (30 inches), wider, and brighter, making it the best desk light for an ultrawide monitor or dual-display setups.\nThe Aether arrives fully assembled, consisting of two totally tubular 14 mm diameter aluminum pipe arms attached to a 7-inch diameter and 1-inch thick base. Embedded across the top arm is a 2-foot, 20 W LED array capable of glowing at up to 1,200 lumens at 20,000 Hz without any noticeable flicker. Its light is spread across a generous 150-degree beam, and Tangram claims the lamp is capable of 65,536 levels of brightness and color temperatures ranging from warm white (3,000 K) to daylight (5,700 K) and every measurement in between.\nBoth arms swing a full 360 degrees, but we found the hinge-free movement a bit stiff, likely intentionally tight to keep the arm from slumping downward when fully outstretched horizontally. Thus you need two hands to adjust either arm.\nThe Aether\u2019s most novel feature is hidden within the end of the top lamp arm: a tiny infrared laser sensor that keeps an eye out for hand gestures. Swipe across to turn the lamp on, swipe again and it shuts off. Keep your hand in front of the sensor and motion with a gentle karate chop to adjust brightness, or change color temperature by bringing the hand closer or pushing out further. The lamp acknowledges each gesture with sing-songy chirps reminiscent of a verbose Star Wars droid.\nLearning the gestures requires a little practice (it\u2019s easier to understand after watching the video demos), but once you\u2019ve memorized the movements, they become second nature. They\u2019re also fun to show-off, especially when done with exaggerated flair.\nThe Aether has two more tricks. First, the top arm can swivel and fold flat, parallel with the stem attached to the base (to just 0.75-inch thick when viewed from the side). This allows it to tuck away into something that resembles one half of an enormous paperclip and effectively transforms it into a mood light. Second, when stretched to its maximum reach of nearly 59 inches, the Aether is tall enough to operate convincingly as a floor lamp.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIt costs as much as a decent 4K monitor. Sure, you\u2019re paying for premium materials, patented gesture tech, and that three-year warranty. But if you just need basic light, cheaper lamps abound.\nThe gesture controls take practice. You\u2019ll most likely spend more than a few minutes waving your hand in every direction like a Hogwarts first-year student before getting a hang of the gestures. After a few days, though, the muscle memory sticks, and you\u2019ll wish every lamp included the features.\nThe aluminum base could be heavier or wider for stability. Give the Aether a high five across its arm while it\u2019s fully extended outward, and the lamp will wobble.\nKey specs\n- Dimensions: 7.9 by 29.7 by 0.7 inches, with a round 7-inch base and 72-inch cord\n- LED bulb included: integrated LED array (irreplaceable)\n- Brightness levels: 65,536 adjustable levels (1,200 lumens)\n- Color temperature: 3,000 K to 5,700 K (warm)\n- Phone charging: no\n- Wattage: 20 W\n- Warranty: three years\nOther desk lamps worth considering\nIf you have the space for a desk lamp that does it all: We recommend the Pure Forms Desk Lamp. Equipped with a pair of independently dimmable LED arrays spanning two sides of the same lamp arm \u2014 one facing downward and the other toward the front \u2014 the lamp can independently or simultaneously shine a beam onto your workspace and deliver a forward-facing light to soften shadows during video calls.\nBoth arrays ride on a double-hinged swing arm that stretches up to 33.5 inches tall and pivots a full 360 degrees at the steel base \u2014 tall enough to perch well above an external monitor. They also feature dimming and color-temperature adjustment of 2,700 K to 6,500 K.\nThe Pure Forms lamp also moonlights as a charging dock for phones, tablets, wireless earbuds, and other compatible devices; the lamp has two USB-C ports (one 65 W), one USB-A port, one HDMI port, and twin 10 W wireless charging pads found along the base. Like the Dyson Solarcycle Morph, the muscular and tech-forward styling weighs heavily, both aesthetically and physically (at 14 pounds).\nIf you want a timeless design for working, reading, or creating a cozy ambiance: The Anglepoise Type 75 Desk Lamp\u2019s triple-spring articulating movement is the definition of set-it-and-forget-it adjustability, stretching up to 26 inches high from the base without any unattended travel. It also swivels 360 degrees from the base and includes a replaceable E26 base bulb instead of an integrated LED.\nThe Type 75\u2019s classic design and its oh-so-nice-to-touch anodized-aluminum matte finish make it aesthetically at home in spaces that are modern, traditional, and every style in between. It\u2019s also backed by a lifetime warranty. The lamp lacks only in its inability to fully rotate at its head, stopping about 10 degrees short of a complete turn.\nIf you want a modernist lamp you can operate with one hand: The Flos Kelvin is an elegantly designed architect\u2019s lamp that I\u2019ve owned for nearly a decade and that I\u2019ve come to appreciate for its simple-to-operate tap-touch controls, smooth adjustability, and stable build.\nIt\u2019s available with a base, clamp, wall arm, or as a drop-in desk support attachment. Its minimalist silhouette, flat rotating LED array, and one-handed operation design are all pluses.\nBut the Kelvin lamp didn\u2019t make the cut as a pick after we observed flickering during video calls (previously invisible to the naked eye). Also, it has a propensity to kick backward like a catapult when positioned too far back and upward.\nIf you need a small desk lamp that can double as a bedside lamp: Check out the Louis Poulsen NJP Mini. It arrives fully assembled, it features a tip-proof heavy steel base and an angled aluminum arm, and it has a 342-degree turning radius you can nudge away or near with one finger.\nThe integrated 10 W LED is bright (without being distracting) and also dimmable. The LEDs are tucked almost halfway back into the lamp shade, so the design eliminates distracting glare.\nThe NJP Mini is a design object with a design pedigree price to match. It\u2019s probably even better suited as a bedside lamp. But its small size, quality build, and one-button control simplicity may appeal to those who prioritize aesthetics as much as functionality.\nWe also tested the full-size Louis Poulsen NJP Table Lamp and recommend it for many of the same reasons as its smaller sibling. Where it may prove to be more appealing to some is the greater height and reach; the full-size ditches the fixed height single arm design for an articulating dual-arm design capable of stretching 25 inches outward and a little over 26 inches in height at full extension. The larger edition also shares the four- or eight-hour timer option and comes with a brighter version of the integrated 10 W LED found within the NJP Mini, bumping up lumens from 418 to 529.\nIf you prefer a wood look and prize cordless portability: The Octagon Portable Desk Light has the most unusual design of the lamps we considered, especially if you get it in the natural walnut wood finish. It\u2019s also one of the few cordless (and therefore portable) lamps we encountered in our research that also had positive reviews.\nIt\u2019s slim (only 3.4 inches wide) and has four touch-controlled brightness levels. But it didn\u2019t get as bright as the other lamps we tested.\nWe didn\u2019t include it as a pick because it toppled often during testing, and several panelists disliked the design. But if you want a cordless LED lamp that you can take anywhere \u2014 we moved it from room to room a couple of times \u2014 it\u2019s an interesting lamp.\nIf you want classic looks and don\u2019t mind reduced adjustability: The IKEA Hektar Work Lamp could be a good choice. This tall, architect-style lamp with a chic brushed-metal finish is one of the retailer\u2019s most popular desk lamps, and it features modern conveniences like wireless charging and a USB port.\nIt\u2019s more top-heavy than other lamps, which made it less likely to hold its position at certain angles in our tests. But if you like the style and don\u2019t plan on using the lamp angled at 90 degrees, it could be an excellent fit for your home office. Note that it\u2019s also a tall lamp (27 inches at its tallest), with a large, 7-inch base.\nIf you want a dimmable desk lamp with a small footprint that blends into the background: The Gantri Gallery Task Light shares a similar offset and short-necked adjustable shade design as the Schoolhouse Joe Task Lamp and Gantri Analog Task Light, making it another space-efficient option for illuminating smaller desks with a focused, intimate glow. The lamp\u2019s plant-based plastic polymer build isn\u2019t as brawny as the all-metal Joe Task Lamp, but it\u2019s also half the price, includes a dimmer, and swivels 180 degrees vertically and 360 degrees horizontally for easy one-handed repositioning. The Gallery Task Light is also anchored with a heavy base that\u2019s fortified with a rubber-lined skid pad to keep the lamp from tipping over.\nGantri includes a replaceable E12 LED bulb that glows on the warmer end of the spectrum (2,700 K), but at 6 W at max brightness, it\u2019s noticeably dimmer than most of our picks.\nWho should get this\nMany people who work at their desks rely solely on overhead lighting. But experts recommend having a mix of light sources in every room \u2014 overhead, task, and accent lighting \u2014 for ambiance and a balance between light and shadow. A desk lamp \u2014 specifically a task lamp that lets you control the light distribution on your desk \u2014 offers benefits that can affect not just your mood but your health as well.\nA benefit of job-specific lighting: Having an adjustable lamp in your workspace reduces the contrast between the object you are focused on and the surrounding area. Lighting designer Linnaea Tillett explained, \u201cWhen you reduce contrast, it\u2019s relaxing for your eye and keeps you from changing your focal perspective.\u201d\nThink of how harsh the bright light of a computer display is in the middle of the night \u2014 the strong contrast can make your eyes more fatigued. A desk lamp can illuminate the area behind or around your computer display, creating a more comfortable environment for your eyes.\nIf you don\u2019t work on close-up tasks at your desk, if you don\u2019t feel eye fatigue with your current lighting scheme, and if you don\u2019t typically work in the evenings or in the dark (when an adjustable light can help reduce eyestrain), you might not need a desk lamp.\nWhy you should trust us\nI\u2019m a design writer focusing on home furnishings, architecture, and industrial design. In addition to co-authoring Creative Spaces: People, Homes, and Studios to Inspire, I\u2019ve written about floor lamps, bed frames, and outdoor furnishings for Wirecutter.\nWhen I\u2019m not busy rearranging a room, decorating a shelf, or fire-hardening our home in Altadena, California, I\u2019m likely poking around our local trails admiring fungus, insects, and slime molds.\nFor this guide:\n- I researched 66 desk lamps and tested 27 total, including seven new models, which I used as my dedicated work lights for a minimum of two evenings each during the most recent round of testing.\n- I read five articles and roundups focused on desk lamps; scoured the r/Workspaces, r/WFH, and r/macsetups subreddits for recommendations; scanned through 1,075 Red Dot Design Award entrants and winners online; and considered other task lighting designs listed by the International Design Excellence Awards, NYCxDesign Festival, Salone del Mobile, and iF Design Award.\n- Like all Wirecutter journalists, I review and test products with complete editorial independence. I\u2019m never made aware of any business implications of my editorial recommendations. Read more about our editorial standards.\nHow we picked and tested\nWe started our research as most people would: looking at online roundups of lamps (though most aren\u2019t worthwhile) and combing through the best-seller lists and owner reviews at retailer sites such as Amazon, Wayfair, Target, IKEA, Rejuvenation, and Lamps Plus.\nWe looked for highly rated lamps in different price ranges. And because everyone has different aesthetic preferences, we sought out desk lamps in a variety of style categories, from classic to modern.\nIn general, we looked for lamps that meet these criteria:\n- LED illumination: We favored LED lamps because they are energy-efficient (better for the environment and your power bill), have long lifespans, don\u2019t get hot, and often allow you to control brightness and color-temperature settings.\n- A power switch on the lamp itself, not on the power cord: When the power switch is on the cord, it\u2019s often hard to reach. This is especially true when you have a lamp at the back of your desk with the cord hanging beneath it. We made an exception for the IKEA Fors\u00e5 Work Lamp due to its status as a long-standing pick. And thankfully the power switch is only about an inch away from the base, so it\u2019s easy to access.\nThese nice-to-have features also informed our choices:\n- Multiple brightness settings: The best lamps don\u2019t just turn on and off; they let you adjust brightness for more versatility as ambient light changes throughout the day.\n- Adjustable color temperature: Some people prefer their light to have a warm color temperature, while others prefer cooler color temperatures. Lamps that have built-in LEDs often provide multiple color-temperature settings, so you can set the light color to your preference or change it according to your mood or the time of day.\nOnce we had our contenders, we got down to assessing each lamp in a real-world setting. In our original round of testing, 23 staff members evaluated the 10 test models based on photos of the lamps and a brief description of their features. Staffers voted on their favorite lamps overall and in each price category.\nNext, we tested each of the lamps throughout the day for over two weeks, comparing all the lamps side by side and taking note of the following:\n- Build quality: Did it feel plasticky or wobbly? Did it have fiddly parts that might not last? Was the finish easily scratched or scuffed?\n- Ease of use: Was the power switch conveniently placed? Was it easy to adjust the height and angle and to switch color temperature and change brightness settings?\n- Light quality: Was there any glare or flickering?\nWe also measured each lamp\u2019s lux level at the lowest and highest height settings to see how each lamp performed with task lighting.\nFinally, to get real-world usability opinions from other people, we asked four panelists to turn the lamps on and off, change the brightness and color-temperature settings where available, and adjust the lamp heights and angles as if they were shopping for a lamp in a store.\nIn subsequent tests, we\u2019ve tried each lamp in a home-office environment, working beside each model as a primary light source for a minimum of three hours each.\nWe also reviewed the adjustability of each model, measured arm reach and swivel distance, and even lightly slapped some of the desk lamps around to test their stability. Also, since working from home is still a reality for many, we turned on each lamp and positioned it for both direct and indirect lighting during a series of video calls, to see whether any of them improved how we looked on camera.\nThe competition\nThis is not a comprehensive list of all desk lamps we\u2019ve considered. We have removed any lamps that no longer meet our criteria or that have been discontinued.\nThe Dyson Solarcycle Morph was previously listed as a desk lamp worth considering. But after using the similarly styled Pure Forms Desk Lamp for several months, we believe it\u2019s a better deal with more functionality \u2014 and it costs about $50 less than the Dyson model.\nThe Anglepoise 90 Mini Mini Desk Lamp is a compact task light that can draw power from a wall outlet, a USB-A port, or even a portable battery \u2014 ideal for people who treat every spot as their office. We previously awarded the 90 Mini Mini a top pick, lauding it for its classic modernist design, tiny footprint, and smoothly articulating arms that could be effortlessly adjusted using just one hand. Unfortunately, long-term testing revealed quality-control issues: Two separate units failed on us within just 27 months.\nThe IKEA Flottilj Desk Lamp is only about $10 and has an easy-to-transport flat-pack design that makes it easy to move from room to room \u2014 ideal for anyone who works from home, say, on a table that doubles as a desk. But its lightweight, interlocking, X-shaped base is paired with a top-heavy design, resulting in a lamp that\u2019s easy to knock over (despite its modest 12-inch height). Ultimately, this is better suited as a spotlight than a desk lamp.\nThe Possini Euro Magnum French Bronze LED Desk Lamp was a previous pick in this guide, but it kept going in and out of stock. If you can find it, it\u2019s still a great lamp. It\u2019s sturdy, attractive, and barely takes up space on a desk. You can\u2019t rotate the head on this lamp, but you can adjust the angle and height, thanks to a pivoting hinge on the arm. You also can\u2019t charge a phone or adjust the color temperature, but you can manipulate the brightness at three levels.\nThe Otus Architect LED Desk Lamp boasts a ton of features that sound useful \u2014 it has 12 brightness levels and three color settings, and you can wave your hand above the lamp to turn it on or off, like a Jedi. But it looks much less attractive in real life than it does in promotional photos \u2014 like a tall, flimsy microphone stand \u2014 and it topples easily. We also had difficulty adjusting the color and brightness of the lamp with the buttons at the top. Using a lamp should not be this hard.\nThis article was edited by Ben Keough and Erica Ogg.

      "text": "The Best Smart LED Light Bulbs\nSmart LED bulbs provide a near-instant way to transform the feel of a room. Screw in a smart bulb (or several) and pair it with an app, and in an instant your TV room has the vibe of a home theater or your dining room a sense of candle-like warmth. And this is possible without ever having to buy and install a dimmer switch.\nThey also excel at making life more convenient. You can easily create Schedules so that bulbs inside and outside your home go off as needed. Or have them light automatically when someone arrives home and turn off when everyone leaves.\nAfter a new round of testing, the WiZ 60W A19 Color LED continues to be the best smart bulb. It delivered strong lux readings at a variety of light levels (more on this later) and has a wide color temperature range, and its app offers the best set of built-in Scenes and smart-home integrations \u2014 all at a great price.\nWe\u2019ve also selected the GE Cync Full Color Direct Connect Smart Bulb as the best smart bulb for task lighting. Its impressive lux scores make it a great option for lighting an office, or anywhere else you need bright but comfortable light to see fine details. Keep in mind that this A21 bulb is slightly larger than the standard A19 shape and so may not fit in smaller lamps and fixtures.\nTips before buying\n- Check compatibility\nLEDs come in a variety of base sizes and bulb shapes. Many may not be suitable outdoors, in humid locations, or in enclosed fixtures.\n- Understanding lumens\nLED bulb brightness is measured in lumens. For 40-, 60-, 75-, or 100-watt incandescent lights, look for a bulb that outputs 450, 800, 1,100, or 1,600 lumens, respectively.\n- Color temperature\nIn addition to changing colors, you can tweak the tone \u2014 the temperature \u2014 of white light from warm and cozy to cooler and more energizing.\n- Connectivity options\nMost bulbs connect to Wi-Fi, so they work only if in range of your home\u2019s router. Some models use mesh Wi-Fi, Thread, or Zigbee wireless, which should provide better range.\nCompatible with: Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri Shortcuts, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings\nThe WiZ 60W A19 Color LED Smart Bulb impressed us with its easy setup, wide array of Scenes, and affordable price. It also scored a high lux rating \u2014 a measure of how effectively a bulb\u2019s light spreads. This model also has a wider color temperature range than most of the other smart bulbs we tested. And in addition to standard options like on/off control and scheduling, this clever LED bulb offers a circadian-rhythm mode that automatically switches the white light color temperature throughout the day based on your sleep and wake schedule.\nCompatible with: Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings\nThe Meross MSL120 Smart Wi-Fi LED Bulb delivered especially consistent lux measurements between the top and side of the bulb, while other bulbs tend to have notably worse light performance on the sides compared with the top. This means its light performance doesn\u2019t suffer at any angle and, as a result, should suit pretty much any light fixture design. It responded quickly when testing it with smart-home automations as well. The Meross bulb is also the only pick that directly supports Apple Home control. That lets you skip the Meross app entirely to control your lights using the Home app, or with a Siri command on your phone or HomePod Mini.\nCompatible with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home\nThe RCA Smart Wi-Fi A19 LED Bulb stands out for its exceptional light output, especially at the lowest light levels. All LEDs lose illuminance, or lux, as they dim, but this connected bulb outdid our other picks by maintaining strong results even at just 10% brightness. Its app was pleasantly uncluttered, making it easy to turn the bulb on and off, change the brightness \u2014 or handle any other adjustments without having to search around for the right screen. It also has a nice selection of features, ranging from basic scheduling and a timer to Scenes and music syncing.\nCompatible with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings\nThe U-tec Bright A19 1100LM outpaced the other 1,100-lumen bulbs we tested with its ability to evenly blanket an area with light, particularly at full brightness (the tech term for that measurement is lux). Its mesh Wi-Fi technology, which uses each additional bulb to form a web-like connection among devices, also helped maintain a steady connection for the bulbs farthest from the router. If your smart lighting plans include installing multiple bulbs throughout your home, a model like this with a mesh Wi-Fi setup is an especially strong choice. The U Home app has frustrating home screen controls, but the issues aren\u2019t a dealbreaker.\nCompatible with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home\nCompared with all of the other 1,600-lumen, 100-watt-equivalent LED bulbs we\u2019ve tested, the GE Cync Full Color Direct Connect Smart Bulb earned especially high scores at 100% brightness. It also performed consistently well at full brightness on both the top and the sides of the bulb, which means it will work in any compatible light fixture without losing illumination at any angle. The companion Cync app is simple to use and has settings such as scheduling and dynamic, color-changing presets like Candle and Party Time. Keep in mind that even though this A21 bulb screws into the same-size socket as a standard A19 model does, the bulb itself is slightly taller and wider and so may stick out of smaller lamps and fixtures. It\u2019s also expensive, but its impressive lux scores offer value for anyone looking for a very bright smart LED.\nThe research\n- Why you should trust us\n- Who this is for\n- How we picked and tested\n- Top pick: WiZ 60W A19 Color LED Smart Bulb\n- Runner-up: Meross MSL120 Smart Wi-Fi LED Bulb\n- Best for simple control: RCA Smart Wi-Fi A19 LED Bulb\n- Best for big homes: U-tec Bright A19 1100LM\n- Best for task lighting: GE Cync Full Color Direct Connect Smart Bulb\n- Other smart LED bulbs worth considering\n- What to look forward to\n- The competition\nWhy you should trust us\nI have more than 14 years of experience writing about technology. For a decade I covered smart-home gadgets at CNET. Some of my Wirecutter guides include smart garage door opener controllers, smart window shades and blinds, and smart hose timers.\nFor this guide:\n- I\u2019ve tested many dozens of light bulbs and other lighting devices over more than a decade covering smart-home tech.\n- I take detailed measurements using a digital light meter.\n- I either return or donate every product I test. I may hold onto some devices for additional time, when warranted, due to long-term testing or anticipated software updates.\nWho this is for\nSmart bulbs are a great option for anyone who wants fast, inexpensive, and easy installation and control of the lights in their home. The connectivity packed into a smart bulb sets it apart from regular LEDs by adding the ability for you to check on the status of, and make changes to, your lights from your phone, with smart app controls, or with a smart speaker or smart display.\nSmart LEDs can adjust from a warm, soothing white light when you\u2019re settling down for the evening to a cool, task-oriented light when you need to focus and get something done.\nIn addition to being able to adjust their white light color temperature between warm and cool, many smart bulbs also have color-changing capabilities so that you can add a little flare for festive occasions or, you know, make your room purple just because.\nThrough years of testing we\u2019ve learned that smart lighting options in general, and smart bulbs in particular, appeal to many who have accessibility or mobility limitations, by making it especially easy to automate, schedule, or remotely control lighting. That may mean turning on or off lights while sitting in a chair across the room or having them set to go on or off at specific times of the day without requiring input.\nYou might want to add multiple smart bulbs throughout your home and automate them via advanced features like Scenes or Routines \u2014 or even use them alongside other types of connected devices, like a smart lock or a smart garage door opener controller.\nJust like any other bulb, the physical installation is simple: Just remove any existing bulb and replace it in seconds with a smart LED. As long as the bulb goes into a compatible fixture with the correct maximum wattage and has the same base size and bulb shape as the old bulb you\u2019re replacing (in this guide we focus on the standard E26 base size and A19 and A21 bulb shapes), it should work exactly the same.\nDownload the bulb\u2019s companion app to be led through the setup instructions and in minutes you\u2019ll be operating the light from your phone, setting custom schedules based on your daily routine and saying to your smart speaker: \u201cTurn off the living room lamp.\u201d\nHow we picked and tested\nIn order to be considered for testing, the smart LED bulb candidates must:\n- be standard A19- or A21-style, ranging from 800 to 1,600 lumens (60- to 100-watt equivalent)\n- include an app with on/off control and scheduling\n- offer adjustable color temperature for white-light LEDs\n- support at least one smart-home integration beyond app control (Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home)\nIn addition to the above criteria, we prioritized bulbs that offered:\n- advanced features like Vacation Mode or Scenes\n- RGB color-changing capabilities\n- support for more than one smart-home integration beyond app control\nIn testing we looked for models that provided:\n- a simple DIY installation\n- straightforward app control\n- voice control/third-party integrations that mirror use in the app\n- reliable performance (repeatable results; minimal/no false notifications or other errors)\n- a good overall value for the money\nTo test each bulb\u2019s smart capabilities and overall reliability, I started with basic app features like on/off control and scheduling. I then tried out any advanced options, like Scenes, Vacation Mode, and music syncing, when available. I also experimented with voice commands using Alexa via an Amazon Echo Dot with clock, Google Assistant on a Google Nest Hub Max, and Siri on my iPhone 16 Pro Max and Apple HomePod Mini.\nFor a further reliability test, I set up a Routine in the Alexa app. Every time the door to the backyard (outfitted with an Aqara Door and Window Sensor) opened, whatever smart bulb I was testing at the moment in an outdoor light fixture turned green. This is a version of a signal we already use with our neighbors behind us to let them know our dogs are outside and vice versa. (Our dogs bark wildly at each other, and this helps spare our other nearby neighbors from their spirited conversations.)\nLighting companies today typically advertise lumens, or the maximum potential brightness of a given bulb. Lux, however, is a measure of illuminance, or how much of that light actually projects onto any surface in its immediate vicinity at a given level of brightness compared with other LEDs at the same brightness. We think lux is the better indicator of real-world performance.\nI measured the performance of each LED in lux using a digital light meter. I set each bulb to its coolest white light color temperature, used a measuring tape to consistently hold the meter 12 inches away from the bulb, and took the average of three measurements on the top and side of each bulb at 100%, 50%, and 10% brightness.\nTop pick: WiZ 60W A19 Color LED Smart Bulb\nCompatible with: Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri Shortcuts, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings\nThe WiZ 60W A19 Color LED Smart Bulb is the best smart bulb, thanks to its great lux performance, simple app setup, wide color temperature range, and large selection of Scenes. This bulb is also one of the more affordable models we tested.\nIt connects easily over Wi-Fi in the WiZ app, and in about a minute or two you can start turning your light on and off, adjusting the white light color temperature, changing the light to any one of the \u201c16 million colors\u201d WiZ says it supports, creating Schedules, and trying out more advanced features like custom effects and automations.\nNote that although WiZ is owned by Philips Hue, the WiZ app operates separately from the larger Zigbee-enabled Philips Hue app and ecosystem.\nIt\u2019s a great way to keep things simple. Despite being our top pick, the WiZ bulb isn\u2019t overly complex. It\u2019s a great option if you want to stick with the plain-and-simple basics: on/off light control, brightness adjustments, changes to bulb color (or temperature) depending on what you\u2019re doing, custom schedules to fit your daily routine, and the ability to share app access with family, friends, visitors, or caregivers.\nBut you can still go all-in if you want. The WiZ 60W A19 Color LED Smart Bulb also has a great collection of additional options. You can create custom Scenes or choose from a selection of preset themes, like Relax and TV Time, that are activity-centric. There are also 19 preset \u201cdynamic effects,\u201d such as Ocean, Sunset, and Jungle, that cycle through colors in a thematic way. The Jungle effect, for instance, cycles among various shades of green and yellow \u2014 it\u2019s a nice effect as it subtly shifts from one color to the next.\nYou can deeply customize the app to your habits. For example, a circadian-rhythm mode changes the light throughout the day according to your particular wake and sleep schedule. Another feature, SpaceSense, is supposed to automatically adjust your lights to your preferred setting when you walk into a room via the WiZ bulb\u2019s built-in motion-sensing technology. (It didn\u2019t always change settings when I was in close proximity to a bulb, though, and felt more like a beta feature as a result.)\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nYou get Siri Shortcuts but not Apple Home. While this bulb has a lot of smart-home functionality, it relies on the more pared-down Shortcuts app rather than the Apple Home app. You can still use Siri to control your WiZ bulb with Shortcuts, but you won\u2019t be able to use any of the advanced automations you can only find in the Home app.\nPrivacy and security snapshot\n- WiZ may collect personal information, such as your name, email address, or phone number, when you use its products or services.\n- WiZ may use cookies to collect your IP address, browser, and other details.\n- You can contact privacy@wizconnected.com if you have any questions or concerns about what information WiZ collects and how it\u2019s used.\nFor more details, read WiZ\u2019s privacy statement.\nRunner-up: Meross MSL120 Smart Wi-Fi LED Bulb\nCompatible with: Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings\nThe Meross MSL120 Smart Wi-Fi LED Bulb offers impressively consistent lux readings across the entire bulb (measuring from both the front and sides of the bulb). It also responds quickly and reliably to commands and automations.\nMajor smart-home apps work, but Meross pushes you to use Apple Home. Even if you begin the setup process in the Meross app, the app prompts iPhone owners to scan the code on the bulb to add it to the Apple Home app. Scanning that code ended up being the only fiddly part of setup, because in order to access the code when the bulb is screwed into a lamp with a shade, we had to unscrew it and then quickly scan it, then screw it back in and turn it on (another editor couldn\u2019t scan the bulb at all and had to input it manually; he later found the code is also on a sticker in the included instructions).\nThe Home app will identify the bulb and ask you to designate a location for it, like \u201cLiving Room,\u201d or, in my case, \u201cBackyard.\u201d Then you can control it from the Home app or with a Siri command without ever having to open the Meross app again, if you so choose.\nQuick responses to custom smart-home automations. The Meross bulb responded the fastest to the testing Routine I created in the Alexa app, using an Aqara Door and Window Sensor and each smart LED. When the door to my backyard was opened, the Meross bulb would turn on glowing green lightning fast (and my neighbors knew to take precautions as the hounds were loose) \u2014 and there was no lag time or misfires.\nConsistent light from all angles. Some bulbs have a notable difference in light performance between the top and side of the bulb at the same brightness. The Meross bulb returned the closest readings of any of our picks from both directions, which means you\u2019ll get comparable light quality no matter the fixture you use or the light angle (1,414 lux and 1,282 lux from the top and side at 100% brightness, 798 lux and 696 lux from the top and side at 50% brightness, and 178 lux and 157 lux from the top and side at 10% brightness).\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThe app is clunky. While the Meross app isn\u2019t difficult to use, it is quirky enough that we think some users will find it off-putting \u2014 parts of it feel a bit like a beta version of a social media platform.\nFor instance, after using the app I am sometimes awarded a few \u201ccoins\u201d via a pop-up alert. The coins are designed to encourage app use \u2014 you get 100 coins for creating an account, another 30 if you post in the forum, and 300 if your post gets over 500 likes. But we haven\u2019t found any explanation of what you can do with these coins or if there\u2019s a way to opt out of the program, other than a little \u201cComing soon\u2026\u201d note on each screen.\nFortunately, all of the key features to control the bulb are easy enough to find, if you can get past the coins. Also, if you connect it through the Apple Home app, you never have to use the Meross one.\nWhen we asked paid testers to try out all of our picks, several pointed out that the Meross app was difficult to use, and one noted their dislike of the ads that were present.\nPrivacy and security snapshot\n- Meross might gather information about you when you register as a user, such as your email address, username, password, and other data.\n- The company requires your \u201cprecise location\u201d when it looks for nearby Meross devices to pair to the app during setup.\n- Meross does \u201cnot currently recognize or respond to browser \u2018Do Not Track\u2019 signals,\u201d according to its privacy statement\nFor more details, read Meross\u2019s privacy statement.\nBest for simple control: RCA Smart Wi-Fi A19 LED Bulb\nCompatible with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home\nThe RCA Smart Wi-Fi A19 LED Bulb had the best lux performance when dimmed to low light levels of any model we tested. The RCA Smart Home app used for setup and control is especially clear and intuitive. It provides a useful roster of features like scheduling, a timer, Scenes, a Do Not Disturb Mode, and music syncing. (I wasn\u2019t sure of the appeal of having my lights change colors in rhythm to Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201cJolene,\u201d but I did it!)\nLow light levels are superb. The RCA emits light that maintains a high lux level at every level of brightness \u2014 even when it was dimmed down to 10%, it earned a higher lux score than any of our other picks (271 lux from the top and 225 lux from the side at 10% brightness).\nIn practice this means that even at night when you\u2019ve dimmed the lights, it never feels muddy and hard to see. So you can continue to read without eye strain or have the ability to locate the remote control that got wedged between the sofa cushions.\nThe app simply works. The RCA app isn\u2019t particularly sleek, but its interface is blissfully clear, with controls that are easy to find and just as simple to use. On one uncluttered screen, you can view the current status of your bulb, adjust its brightness, turn it on and off and change either the color temperature or the color. Three additional tabs hold RCA\u2019s lineup of 34 existing Scenes, its music syncing feature that changes your bulb\u2019s color to the rhythm of whatever music you\u2019re playing on your phone, and additional options like scheduling, a timer, and a Do Not Disturb Mode.\nMany of our paid testers found the RCA app to be the most intuitive to understand among all our picks\u2019 apps, with one saying it was \u201cFun, the easiest to use with the most amount of options.\u201d\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIt has limited smart-home integrations. This bulb only supports Amazon Alexa and Google Home. If one (or both) of those is plenty for your smart-home plans, this won\u2019t be an issue. If, however, you\u2019d prefer to use Apple Home or Samsung SmartThings with this LED, you\u2019re out of luck.\nPrivacy and security snapshot\n- Third-party companies working with RCA gather and use personal information only when it\u2019s required as part of a service they perform. Be sure to check those company\u2019s privacy policies separately.\n- Email support@rcalights.com if you have any questions about your privacy and security when using RCA products and related software.\nFor more details, read RCA\u2019s privacy statement.\nBest for big homes: U-tec Bright A19 1100LM\nCompatible with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings\nThe U-tec Bright A19 1100LM offers better lux performance, meaning more usable light, at 100% brightness than any of the other 1,100-lumen models I\u2019ve tested. It\u2019s the first bulb I\u2019ve tested that makes use of Wi-Fi\u2013based mesh technology, which means that each bulb acts as a wireless relay to other bulbs and so should ensure bulbs stay connected \u2014 a great option if you have a particularly spacious home or spotty Wi-Fi. The Bright is a bit more expensive than some of our other picks, and I found the app to be less intuitive to use as well. But it\u2019s still a good choice for anyone who wants the assurance of mesh wireless.\nIt beats other 1,100-lumen bulbs at 100% brightness. The U-tec bulb has strong lux performance at all brightness levels, and it scored the best of all the 1,100-lumen bulbs we\u2019ve tested at maximum brightness (1,600 and 1,285 lux from the top and side of the bulb at 100% brightness). That means more of the bulb\u2019s 100% brightness reached the light meter I was holding 12 inches away in comparison with any other bulb with the same specs at the same brightness and measurement distance.\nFor day-to-day purposes, the U-tec bulb at full brightness will illuminate whatever is in its path \u2014 a notebook, your cat, a really juicy cheeseburger \u2014 better than the competition at the same level of brightness. I set up four of these bulbs at home: one in the living room, two in the office, and one in a bedroom. I especially noticed a difference in how well I could read my notebook in the office at various levels of brightness compared with the other standard LED bulb I was using before.\nIt fills Wi-Fi dead spots. I installed four U-tec bulbs in my home. The living room bulb was 5 feet from the router, the two office bulbs were roughly 15 and 17 feet away, and the bedroom bulb was about 25 feet away and also had more obstacles between it and the router. Though the farthest bulb was in a spot that would normally struggle to maintain a consistently strong Wi-Fi connection, the mesh tech kicked in, and it worked seamlessly throughout testing. The connection was stable, and there wasn\u2019t any other performance wonkiness that would typically have occurred in that room. If your dream smart lighting setup includes multiple bulbs in various corners of your home, mesh Wi-Fi tech could prove extremely handy.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThe app needs work. The U Home app\u2019s main screen displays all of your devices at a glance. It tells you whether your lights are on or off and allows for basic on/off control. But there\u2019s also a very finicky dimming function that I found frustrating-to-impossible to use because you have to slide your finger past the on/off button, and it\u2019s difficult to place your finger correctly for it to respond and not accidentally turn the light off. Instead, you have to click on the device to open the larger control screen for any reasonable access to dimming your lights. The app is also a little convoluted in general. Basic features are hidden behind multiple screens and selections. I also wish the scheduling function offered a built-in sunrise/sunset option.\nPrivacy and security snapshot\n- U-tec collects a variety of information when you use its services, including your name, phone number, email address, device location, and your username and password.\n- Contact privacy@u-tec.com if you want more information about the data that U-tec collects and how it\u2019s used.\nFor more details, read U-tec\u2019s privacy statement.\nBest for task lighting: GE Cync Full Color Direct Connect Smart Bulb\nCompatible with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home\nThe GE Cync Full Color Direct Connect Smart Bulb is brighter than any other bulb we\u2019ve tested. Its consistent lux readings at 100% brightness on both the top and the sides of the bulb also mean that it should perform well in pretty much any fixture of your choosing (as long as it fits; more on that below).\nAlthough the layout of the Cync app isn\u2019t as intuitive to understand as that of other apps, it\u2019s still easy enough to navigate. It has basic on/off functions, scheduling, preset color-changing Scenes, and the option to create your own. The bulb also responded well to our Alexa voice commands; we got a quick response when telling Alexa to \u201cturn the Cync bulb green\u201d or \u201cdim to 50%.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the brightest bulb we\u2019ve ever tested. At 100% brightness, this Cync smart bulb blew away the competition, including other 1,600-lumen LED models (1,974 lux and 1,965 lux from the top and side at 100% brightness).\nI tried this bulb out in two different lamps during testing: a metal desk lamp with the light mainly coming from the top of the bulb and a medium-size table lamp with a cloth lampshade with more diffused light coming from all angles. The more directional metal desk lamp with focused light coming from the top of the bulb was almost too bright for me at 100% brightness. This lamp illuminates my notebook so I that can read my list of tasks and make changes to it throughout the day. While still supremely bright, the table lamp with the lampshade that I also keep on my desk diffused the 100% brightness enough to distribute it more evenly across my desk for bright overall task lighting, in contrast to the other lamp\u2019s too-bright, focused light.\nOf course, you can also dim this bulb and adjust its color temperature if you\u2019d like to use it for other purposes.\nIts lux readings are consistent all around. Many bulbs see a significant drop in performance between the top and sides, but this one delivered impressively brilliant lux readings from both angles (1,974 lux and 1,965 lux from the top and side at 100% brightness). As with the Meross MSL120 Smart Wi-Fi LED Bulb, this means you\u2019ll get similarly strong light performance no matter the style of your fixture or the bulb\u2019s angle in the fixture.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIt might not fit in every fixture. Standard bulbs come in a specific size, called A19. While this Cync bulb has the same overall shape and threads as its A19 counterparts, as an A21 the bulb itself is longer and larger. For most fixtures, you wouldn\u2019t notice a difference (just confirm, as always, that the bulb is compatible with the maximum wattage for whatever fixture you use). Because it\u2019s longer, it may stick out of some lamps and fixtures, or may be too large overall, especially if your lampshade is the kind with metal hoops that grasp the bulb.\nI measured the GE Cync Full Color Direct Connect Smart Bulb at 6 inches long and 8.75 inches in circumference at its widest point. A standard GE A19 bulb measured 4.5 inches long and 7.5 inches in circumference at its widest point.\nIt\u2019s expensive. While pricing varies depending on sales, this model\u2019s $20 list price for a single bulb at this writing is nearly $10 higher than that of our top pick, the WiZ 60W A19 Color LED.\nPrivacy and security snapshot\n- The Cync app features two-factor authentication, which sends you a code to finalize your login after you input your email and password credentials.\n- GE Lighting may collect some of your personal information when you use its services and may share that information with other Savant companies (Savant is the parent company of GE Lighting) and third parties.\nFor more details, read GE Lighting\u2019s privacy statement.\nOther smart LED bulbs worth considering\nWhile the following models didn\u2019t make it onto our list of favorites, they\u2019re decent bulbs that may be a good option for some buyers.\nIf you prefer Bluetooth when you\u2019re home: The Govee Wi-Fi+ Bluetooth RGBWW Smart LED Bulb (H6008) relies on Bluetooth when you\u2019re within range and Wi-Fi when you aren\u2019t. However, its app is cluttered and difficult to use.\nIf you want a scalable Zigbee-powered LED ecosystem: The Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance A19 Starter Kit is an excellent choice if you prefer Zigbee over Wi-Fi and plan to add more products from the lighting platform\u2019s large selection. That said, the starter kit is expensive, and additional standalone bulbs cost a shocking $55 a pop. These pricey LEDs also didn\u2019t perform as well as our winners.\nWhat to look forward to\nWe plan to test the redesigned GE Cync Reveal bulbs, which are set to release in the second half of the year and claim to have superior light quality.\nThe competition\nWe don\u2019t recommend the following bulbs we tested for reasons that may include performance, features, or price.\nThe Aqara LED Bulb T2 had lower lux readings than other 1,100-lumen models we tested.\nThe LIFX A21 Smart Light didn\u2019t score quite as well in light performance as the GE Cync Full Color Direct Connect Smart Bulb, and its $40 price tag for one bulb is steep.\nIn comparison with the other 1,600-lumen bulbs we tested, the WiZ Bulb 100W A21 E26 had unusually poor scores at 100% brightness (though still higher than those of 60 W models), so much so that we tested it again to confirm the accuracy of our measurements.\nThe Tapo app with the TP-Link Tapo L535E Multicolor Smart Light Bulb was simple to use, but the LED scored low lux readings, to the extent that we tested the bulb a second time to make sure the numbers were correct.\nThe Amazon Basics Smart A19 LED Light Bulb was easy to set up and use in the Alexa app, however it performed poorly in our light meter tests.\nThe GE Cync Dynamic Effects Smart Bulb offers a nice range of features, but it costs more than our picks despite weaker performance, and we found its app trickier to use.\nThe Nanoleaf Matter Essentials A19 Smart Bulb boasts a cool design, but its glitchy Matter setup gave me nothing but trouble from the beginning.\nPrevious authors of this guide have tested a number of smart bulbs, which we either dismissed or no longer recommend compared with the value and performance of our current picks (some may simply be discontinued).\nThose tested include:\n- Abode Color Bulb\n- Bulbrite Solana Smart LED Bulb\n- Cree Lighting Connected Max Tunable White + Color Bulb\n- GE Cync Direct Connect Smart Bulb\n- Geeni Prisma Plus\n- Kasa Smart Light Bulb KL125\n- Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Light Bulb Multicolor KL130\n- LIFX Color A19 Wi-Fi Smart Bulb\n- Peace by Hampton Full Color A19 LED Smart Wi-Fi Bulb (discontinued)\n- IKEA\u2019s Tr\u00e5dfri Smart LED Bulb\n- Ilumi A19 Color Smart Bulb\n- Sylvania Smart+ Bluetooth Mesh LED Bulb\n- Sylvania Smart+ LED Wi-Fi Full Color Bulb\n- Sylvania Smart+ Zigbee Full Color and Tunable White Bulb\n- Tapo Smart Light Bulb L530E\n- Treatlife Smart Wi-Fi LED Bulb\nThis article was edited by Jon Chase and Grant Clauser.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "not designed to lastViktoriiaIt's an extremely beautiful lamp and when I saw the design I knew it wasn't gonna last\u2014thin glass with a metal snapping mechanism and plastic stand that makes it tip over really easily. But it lasted 3!! days. Didn't even drop it, was trying to lift and the bottom cracked. While looks really pretty, the lifespan is just really short unless you're gonna place it somewhere where it is never touched or moved (and able to deliver it there safely). 1\nCAUTION!!!NelsonI bought this lamp in AS-IS department and almost got my hand fingers cut by a very sharp piece of broken glass, I understand the term \u201cAs-Is\u201d but Indont thing the meaning extends to the risk of customer safety, please be careful when placed a item for sale As-Is, broken glass I don\u2019t think is allowed by the law1\nGreat soft light with a smart bulbKevinThis lamp can be overly bright with a standard bulb, but a smart bulb gives enough control to make it work wonderfully. The glass makes the light very diffuse, allowing the lamp to light up a room even if placed where you look at it directly without hurting the eyes or overwhelming the surrounding view.5\nLooks good, but too fragile to recommend BenjaminI love the way it looks and operates. Unfortunately this thing is *extremely* fragile. I bought two, and one shattered while pulling it out of the box. If you can manage to unbox it, mount the bulb, plug it in, and then never allow anything to touch it ever again, you'll have a great lamp. But be careful! 2\nlovelyJeniferThis lamp works great, and arrived packed fairly well with no damage. I added a 60w smart bulb so I can change up the colors, and the light is always evenly diffused from the glass shade. 5\nLoveSamSuper cute, delicate though but really nice with a colored light bulb. Be careful though because if knocked over it will shatter. I would put it on the floor or in a secure spot. Would def repurchase 5\nGreat!AngelThis is simple and a statement piece at the same time.5\namazingAndersonI have been looking for this because in my office they have this, thankfully the stock came back\n5\nTOO BRIGHT KikiThis is way too bright & I just found out the only way to return is at a store! They just lost my future business. I had a cart full of items but if I have to arrange my own shipping & pay for that way forget it, I'll buy elsewhere. 1\nStreaming backgroundDanielUsed a Philips hue bulb in it and put in in the background of my stream setup love it 5\nVery niceChristianVery nice product5\nPretty globe light.AnonymousThis is really pretty and works great with a smart bulb. 5\nLove these orbs, I have 3 of themJaclynThese are so pretty and make the livingroom look so nice. I got one, loved it, and bought 2 more. Super easy to change out bulbs, takes 5 seconds, no other assembly needed5\nGreat diffused lightingSahomiI put this on a shelf in my new room and its absolutely perfect with a smart color changing bulb. I only wish the based was more secure with the globe, especially with how heavy the globe part is. It wiggles if you go to move it. but at this price, I can't complain a ton. 5\nVery chill lampNickLove this lamp. Goes well with the TOKABO table lamp5\nVery disappointedMariaThis lamp is beautiful, very simple design but it can really enhance a corner. It lasted about 2 months. Now it inexplicably doesn't work. I am so disappointed because I live 3 hours from the nearest Ikea and have ordered this online. 2\nglobe lampJohnA little oversized for the space I had, but worked fine with SMART bulb.5\nCute orbKetaThis little lamp is a fun addition to my home. I would mark 1/2 point off as there are a couple of tiny flaws in the glass but they aren't visible so five stars it is. 5\nLove this lamp it goes with any decorDeniseI love this lamp because some times you don\u2019t know what kind of lamp you want for a certain space and this lamp is perfect. 5\nSo cute! TiannaThis gives off a very homey glow with my soft light bulb and completes my sideboard very nicely! 5"
