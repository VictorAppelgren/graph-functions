  "content": "Israel\u2019s political-security cabinet approved a plan early on Friday to take control of Gaza City, as the country expands its military operations despite intensifying criticism at home and abroad over the devastating almost two-year-old war.\n\n\u201cThe IDF will prepare to take control of Gaza City while providing humanitarian aid to the civilian population outside the combat zones,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said in a statement, referring to the Israeli Defence Forces.\n\nWhile Netanyahu said on Thursday Israel intended to take military control of the entire Gaza Strip, the plan approved on Friday focused specifically on Gaza City, the largest city in the enclave, located in its north.\n\nAxios reporter Barak Ravid, citing an Israeli official, said on X the plan involved evacuating Palestinian civilians from Gaza City and launching a ground offensive there.\n\nAsked if Israel would take over the entire coastal territory, Netanyahu told Fox News Channel\u2019s Bill Hemmer in an interview on Thursday: \u201cWe intend to.\u201d\n\nBut he said Israel wanted to hand over the territory to Arab forces that would govern it. He did not elaborate on the governance arrangements or which Arab countries could be involved.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter. We don\u2019t want to govern it. We don\u2019t want to be there as a governing body,\u201d he said.\n\nIsraeli officials described a previous meeting this week with the head of the military as tense, saying military chief Eyal Zamir had pushed back on expanding Israel\u2019s campaign.\n\nAmong the scenarios being considered ahead of the security meeting was a phased takeover of areas in Gaza not yet under military control, one government source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nEvacuation warnings could be issued to Palestinians in specific areas of Gaza, potentially giving them several weeks before the military moves in, the person added.\n\nIn its Friday statement, Netanyahu\u2019s office said the vast majority of the political-security cabinet members believed that \u201cthe alternative plan presented in the cabinet would not achieve the defeat of Hamas nor the return of the hostages.\u201d\n\nTwo government sources said any resolution by the security cabinet would need to be approved by the full cabinet, which may not meet until Sunday.\n\nTotal control of the territory would reverse a 2005 decision by Israel by which it withdrew Israeli citizens and soldiers from Gaza, while retaining control over its borders, airspace and utilities.\n\nRight-wing parties blame that withdrawal decision for the terrorist Palestinian group Hamas gaining power there in a 2006 election.\n\nIt was unclear whether Netanyahu was foreseeing a prolonged takeover or a short-term operation. Israel has repeatedly said it aims to dismantle Hamas and free Israeli hostages.\n\nHamas in a statement called Netanyahu\u2019s comments \u201ca blatant coup\u201d against the negotiation process.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu\u2019s plans to expand the aggression confirm beyond any doubt that he seeks to get rid of his captives and sacrifice them,\u201d the statement said.\n\nArab countries would \u201conly support what Palestinians agree and decide on,\u201d a Jordanian official source told Reuters, adding that security in Gaza should be handled through \u201clegitimate Palestinian institutions.\u201d\n\nHamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera the group would treat any force formed to govern Gaza as an \u201coccupying\u201d force linked to Israel.\n\nEarlier this year, Israel and the United States rejected an Egyptian proposal, backed by Arab leaders, that envisaged the creation of an administrative committee of independent, professional Palestinian technocrats entrusted with the governance of Gaza after the war.\n\nOpinion polls show most Israelis want the war to end in a deal that would see the release of the remaining hostages.\n\nThe White House had no immediate comment. President Donald Trump has declined to say whether he supported or opposed a potential full military takeover of Gaza by Israel.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s government has insisted on total victory over Hamas, which ignited the war when it staged a deadly October 2023 attack on Israel from Gaza.\n\nThe UN has called reports about a possible expansion of Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza \u201cdeeply alarming\u201d if true.\n\nThe idea, pushed especially by far-right ministers in Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, of Israeli forces moving into areas they do not already hold in the enclave has also generated alarm in Israel.\n\nThere are 50 hostages still held in Gaza, of whom Israeli officials believe 20 are alive. Most of those freed so far emerged as a result of diplomatic negotiations.\n\nTalks toward a cease-fire that could have seen more hostages released collapsed in July.\n\nA senior Palestinian official said Hamas had told Arab mediators an increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza would lead to a resumption in cease-fire negotiations.\n\nIsraeli officials accuse Hamas of seizing aid to hand to its fighters and to sell to finance its operations, accusations the terror group denies.\n\nVideos released last week of two living hostages showed them emaciated and frail, stirring international condemnation.\n\nRecent images of starving children from Gaza have also shocked the world and fueled international criticism of Israel over the sharply worsening conditions in the enclave.\n\nHamas, which has ruled Gaza for nearly two decades but now controls only fragmented parts, insists any deal must lead to a permanent end to the war. Israel says the group has no intention of going through with promises to give up power afterwards.",

      "text": "Hamas releases chilling video of \u2018living skeleton\u2019 hostage Evyatar David: \u2018Few days left to live\u2019\nHamas forced emaciated Israeli hostage Evyatar David to dig his own grave in a sick new propaganda video, as the twisted terror group continued to stall negotiations to release the remaining living captives.\nIn the nearly 5-minute clip released Friday, the 24-year-old David is seen in a tunnel with a ceiling roughly as high as he is tall, crossing off dates on a calendar and digging a grave.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten for a few days in a row,\u201d David says in the footage.\nIn the middle of the video, the person behind the camera hands him a can of beans.\n\u201cThis can is for two days,\u201d David says. \u201cThis whole can is for two days so that I don\u2019t die.\n\u201cThis is the grave I think I\u2019m going to be buried in. Time is running out.\u201d\nThe David family, which allowed the release of the video, said in a statement sent to the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters, \u201cWe are forced to witness our beloved son and brother, Evyatar David, deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas\u2019s tunnels in Gaza \u2014 a living skeleton, buried alive.\n\u201cThe deliberate starvation of our son as part of a propaganda campaign is one of the most horrifying acts the world has seen.\u201d\nThe appalling video sparked outrage in Israel and across the globe.\n\u201cHamas terrorists deliberately starve our hostages, documenting them in a cynical, humiliating, and malicious manner,\u201d said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nNaftali F\u00fcrst, a Holocaust survivor, said she watched the images of the hostages with a \u201cheavy heart,\u201d taking her back decades.\n\u201cI survived Auschwitz and Buchenwald. I know hunger up close. In the camps, we were given rations of bread and watery soup,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were so hungry, we would even eat grass if we could find it.\n\u201cI remember the humiliation\u2014the complete stripping of human dignity. I know the fear, the terror.\u201d\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill pointed to Hamas\u2019 monstrous treatment of David as a reminder of the terrorist group\u2019s barbarity and role in prolonging the bloody conflict in Gaza.\n\u201cThe chilling video of Hamas hostage Evyatar David is a grotesque reminder of why America must stand with Israel and demand every hostage\u2019s release,\u201d retiring Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) told The Post.\nHe added, \u201cIf Hamas released the tortured hostages, this war would end.\u201d\n\u201cIran-backed Hamas terrorists have held innocent people hostage, starving them for 666 days,\u201d Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said of the horrifying footage.\n\u201cJust look at these photos \u2014 it\u2019s gut-wrenching. Every day that goes by is a risk to their lives. We cannot stop until every hostage is home and Hamas is destroyed.\u201d\nSen. John Fetterman (D-PA.) recounted how he met with David\u2019s family and demanded Hamas release the hostages.\n\u201cI cannot even begin to imagine the horror of this video for them. I continue to stand with these families and every last hostage. Hamas: send these poor souls home, disarm, and end this hell on earth in Gaza,\u201d Fetterman said in response to the chilling video.\nHudson Valley Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) called the imagery \u201cvile\u201d and underscored Hamas\u2019 role in fueling the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.\n\u201cThis is vile. Where are all those demanding Israel end this war now? Lawler stressed. \u201cWhere are all those decrying the humanitarian crisis now?\n\u201cThe only entity for the devastation that has been inflicted upon innocent Israelis and Palestinians is Hamas. Period. Full stop.\u201d\nRep. Ritchie Torres (D-Bronx) said, \u201cThe world\u2019s silence about the deliberate starvation of Israelis and Jews \u2014 at the hands of Hamas and Islamic Jihad \u2014 is as deafening as its hypocrisy.\u201d\n\u201cA humanitarianism that devalues Jewish life is no humanitarianism at all, for it has been hollowed out by antisemitism,\u201d Torres added.\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot called the images \u201cvile\u201d and \u201cunbearable.\u201d\n\u201cThe hostage\u2019s hell must end,\u201d he wrote on X Saturday.\nIsrael has come under heightened pressure on the world stage over the conditions in Gaza, with countries such as Canada, the UK and France moving to recognize a Palestinian state as soon as next month.\nBut top US officials have repeatedly sought to drill home to allies that Hamas is the one preventing peace.\n\u201cThe fastest way to end the Humanitarian Crises in Gaza is for Hamas to SURRENDER AND RELEASE THE HOSTAGES!!!\u201d President Trump emphasized on Truth Social earlier this week.\nHamas is believed to still have 20 living hostages in captivity and 30 who are dead. Despite that, Israel has moved to allow more humanitarian aid to the war-torn enclave, including from airdrops, tactical pauses in key areas, and the opening of new routes for aid to flow through.\nThe cruel hostage video marks the second one released by the terror group this week.\nOn Thursday, chilling footage showed Israeli hostage Rom Braslavski ghostly and frail as he cried during the six-minute video.\nBoth were kidnapped at the Nova music festival during the Oct. 7 terror attack and are among the remaining 20 hostages believed to still be alive.\n\u201cThey are on the absolute brink of death,\u201d brother Ilay David said Saturday, speaking in English before a crowd of thousands in Tel Aviv gathered for their weekly demonstrations to call for the release of all hostages and an end to the war.\nDavid called on Trump to secure the release of the hostages \u201cby any means necessary.\u201d\n\u201cTo remain silent now is to be complicit in their slow agonizing death,\u201d he said.\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff, meanwhile, told Israeli hostages\u2019 families in a meeting in Tel Aviv earlier Saturday, that he had no news of progress in talks with Hamas, according to Hebrew media.\n\u201cI hear your frustration. But the situation is complicated. There are many reasons that I cannot detail,\u201d he said.\nWitkoff added that an end to the war was \u201cvery close,\u201d according to a statement by the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters.\n\u201cWe have a plan to \u2026 bring everyone home.\u201d\nThe Trump administration envoy said the US was after a deal that would release all hostages from the Palestinian enclave and end the war.\n\u201cNo piecemeal deals,\u201d he added. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t work. We\u2019ve tried everything.\u201d\nHamas refuted claims by Witkoff it was ready to lay down arms, vowing not to disarm \u201cas long as the occupation exists\u201d and until there is a fully sovereign Palestinian state."

      "text": "Israeli military chief opposes Netanyahu\u2019s plan to occupy Gaza\nThe Israel Defense Forces\u2019 top commander is pushing back against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plan for full military control of the Gaza Strip.\nDuring a tense, three-hour meeting Tuesday night, IDF chief of staff Eyal Zamir warned the premier that occupying Gaza would only threaten the lives of the remaining hostages and his soldiers, three Israeli officials briefed on the meeting told Reuters.\nDespite pushback from current and former Israeli security officials, Netanyahu has maintained that military pressure is the only way to free the remaining 50 hostages in Gaza and finish Hamas off for good.\nThe Jewish state currently controls about 75% of the Gaza Strip, with Netanyahu preparing to order the IDF to launch a full-scale invasion of the remaining territory to pressure Hamas to accept a cease-fire, according to Israeli media.\nThe call was made without Zamir\u2019s input, with the Jerusalem Post reporting that an internal memo was sent out Monday calling on the chief of staff to fall in line or resign.\nThe IDF had previously rejected a takeover plan, warning Israeli leadership that a full occupation of Gaza \u2014 requiring a military presence in crowded civilian areas and the few cities spared from the fighting \u2014 would lead to years of sifting through the population to smoke out Hamas\u2019 remaining cells.\nThe hostages, no more than 20 of whom are believed to still be alive, are thought to be held in the few areas of Gaza untouched by the conflict, including the city of Deir al-Balah.\nFamilies of the captives fear any military action would put their loved ones in grave danger after Hamas reportedly put out an order to execute the hostages if Israeli soldiers are spotted nearby.\nZamir\u2019s opposition has been echoed by 19 former top Israeli military, intelligence and police officials, who also objected to the plan and accused Netanyahu of trying to appease members of his far-right coalition, some of whom had threatened to topple the government if the war doesn\u2019t escalate.\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid also spoke with Netanyahu on Wednesday, warning the premier that he would face severe backlash at home if a full military takeover of Gaza goes ahead.\nIsrael has also faced condemnation abroad over the plan, with the United Nations calling the takeover prospect \u201cdeeply alarming.\u201d\nNetanyahu\u2019s push for full military pressure came after Hamas published videos last week of two emaciated hostages suffering inside the terror group\u2019s vast, underground tunnel network.\nThe haunting images renewed calls to end the war, which was started by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel."

Behind every story, there\u2019s pain you don\u2019t see,\u201d Rizvi wrote on her Instagram Story Thursday.\n\u201cBefore judging, try understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cBe kind. Be human.\u201d\nIftikhar, the founder of recruitment firm Staffing Match, is married to both Rizvi and Erum Salman, according to the Daily Mail.\nRizvi lives in Pakistan, where she operates a salon and posts glitzy photos of herself on social media to her half a million followers on TikTok and Instagram.\nIftikhar was traveling from London, England, to Lahore, Pakistan, with Salman and their three kids when he became intoxicated and disruptive on Feb. 7, 2023.\nThe 37-year-old father of three was downing champagne in front of his children during the flight\u2019s first-meal service when he reached over the counter and began grabbing ice for himself using his hands, according to the Mirror.\nCabin crew staffers reprimanded Iftikhar, telling him to go back to his seat when the crazed passenger launched into his tirade.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do, you racist f\u2013king bitch. I know where you are from in Cardiff,\u201d Iftikhar screamed during the flight, according to the outlet.\nIftikhar attempted to fight male flight attendant Tommy Merchant before escalating the situation and horrifyingly identifying the hotel room Walsh would be staying in at the Avari Lahore Hotel.\n\u201cThe white sheep s\u2013ing bitch will be dead. The floor of your hotel will be blown up and it will disappear,\u201d Iftikhar shouted, according to the Mirror. \u201cYou will be dragged by your hair from your room and gang-raped and set on fire.\u201d\nOfficials managed to get the hotheaded executive to return to his seat and Iftikhar was allowed off the flight without any police intervention in Pakistan.\nPolice in England arrested Iftikhar at his $1.2 million home in Iver, England, on March 16, 2024.\nStaffing Match, which Iftikhar and Salmar ran, went bankrupt after amassing $22.8 million of debt following the executive\u2019s arrest, the Daily Mail reported.\nIftikhar admitted to making the threats to kill and the racial harassment of Walsh during the flight, but denied any harassment charges stemming from his altercation with Merchant.\nIftikhar was sentenced to 15 months in prison for his outburst on Tuesday during a hearing at Isleworth Crown Court.\nWalsh testified during the hearing, saying she was left traumatized from the incident and forced to take 14 months off work in the aftermath.\n\u201cI am a strong, brave, happy stewardess, and loved my job. I am well-known within the company. I have been flying with Virgin Atlantic for 37 years. I was working when all flights were grounded on 9/11, and I\u2019ve even flown into a warzone. But this incident has broken me,\u201d she read in a victim impact statement.\n\u201cNever in my entire career flying for 37 years have I not been sure what to do. I have had the best career in the world for 37 years. But he has taken that away from me,\u201d she added.\nVirgin Atlantic supported Walsh for her bravery in speaking out during Iftikhar\u2019s court hearing.\n\u201cThe safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority, and we take a zero-tolerance approach to any disruptive or abusive behaviour on board our aircraft,\u201d a Virgin Atlantic spokesperson told The Post. \u201cWe will always work closely with the relevant authorities and will not hesitate to seek prosecution for those individuals who cause disruption onboard through unacceptable behaviour.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly grateful to Angie and our cabin crew onboard who dealt with this distressing situation in a calm, courageous and professional manner. We are proud of Angie for her bravery in court and we will continue to offer her our full support.\u201d\nSalman hasn\u2019t publicly commented on her husband\u2019s jail sentence."

This is a devastating incident, and our hearts go out to his loved ones,\u201d the company said.\nWatkins\u2019 mom, Gwen, stepdad, and brother Amon were waiting for him at a safari lodge when the brutal incident unfolded, the outlet reported.\nHe was the head of Watkins Ranch Group, a successful brokerage company that sells multimillion-dollar ranches in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas, according to the company\u2019s website.\nThe affluent rancher was active in the Dallas Safari Club and avidly hunted birds and other wildlife, according to several social media posts where he boasted about his hunts.\nWatkins was raised in Dallas, where he worked on his family\u2019s hunting and cattle ranch, according to his company biography.\nHis ex-wife, Courtney, and their teenage daughter, Savannah, were also notified of his tragic death.\n\u201cThis photo is from another time, another chapter of our lives \u2014 but it\u2019s one that will always be a part of our daughter\u2019s story,\u201d Courtney wrote alongside an old photo with their daughter that has since been deleted, according to the outlet.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in a state of shock and heartbreak ever since, trying to process not just the loss, but the complexity that comes with it,\u201d she said.\nCape buffalo can weigh over 2,000 pounds and reach a height of 5.5 feet at the shoulder, according to wildlife experts.\nThe species is notoriously ill-tempered, especially when wounded, and often moves in herds of up to 500 animals."

      "text": "Anti-Israel activist Mahmoud Khalil argues Oct. 7 terror attack was \u2018desperate attempt\u2019 by Palestinians to \u2018break the cycle\u2019\nAnti-Israel activist Mahmoud Khalil argued Tuesday that the heinous Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel was a \u201cdesperate\u201d moment Palestinians \u201chad to reach\u201d in order to be heard.\nThe former Columbia University student, who was detained for over three months by the Trump administration for his prominent role in antisemitic campus protests, offered his thin rationale for the deadliest terror attack on the Jewish State in an interview with New York Times journalist Ezra Klein, who repeatedly asked Khalil to clarify his remarks.\n\u201cTo me, it felt frightening that we had to reach this moment in the Palestinian struggle,\u201d Khalil said, when asked about what he was thinking on the day of the attack that killed more than 1,000 people in Israel, mostly civilians.\n\u201cI remember I didn\u2019t sleep for a number of days, and Noor [Khalil\u2019s wife] was very worried about my health. It was heavy. I still remember. I was like: \u2018This couldn\u2019t happen,\u2019\u201d he added.\n\u201cThe Ezra Klein Show\u201d host followed up by asking: \u201cWhat do you mean we had to reach this moment? What moment is this?\u201d\n\u201cYou can see that the situation is not sustainable,\u201d Khalil responded, referring to tensions between Israel and Gaza and the West Bank in the run-up to Oct. 7.\n\u201cYou have an Israeli government that\u2019s absolutely ignoring Palestinians,\u201d he argued. \u201cThey are trying to make that deal with Saudi and just happy about their Abraham Accord without looking at Palestinians \u2014 as if Palestinians are not part of the equation. They circumvented the Palestinian question.\u201d\n\u201cIt was clear that it was becoming more and more violent. By Oct. 6, over 200 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces and settlers. Over 40 of them were children. So that\u2019s what I mean by: Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t avoid such a moment.\u201d\nKlein later asked Khalil if he felt the attack was something \u201cHamas must have wanted\u201d to drag Israel into an all-out war or rather an event \u201cthat needed to happen to break the equilibrium.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s more the latter \u2014 just to break the cycle, to break that Palestinians are not being heard,\u201d Khalil argued. \u201cAnd to me, it\u2019s a desperate attempt to tell the world that Palestinians are here, that Palestinians are part of the equation.\u201d\n\u201cThat was my interpretation of why Hamas did the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel.\u201d\nKhalil declined to characterize the attack as a \u201cmistake,\u201d when asked by Klein, but acknowledged that \u201ctargeting civilians is wrong.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, these horrible things happened, but we cannot ask Palestinians to be perfect victims,\u201d the activist continued.\nKhalil was arrested by federal immigration authorities on March 8 and spent 104 days at a Louisiana detention center as the Trump administration fought to deport the Syrian-born permanent resident.\nThe administration said Khalil, who is now suing the federal government for $20 million over his detainment, engaged in activities \u201caligned to Hamas.\u201d\nLast month, in a heated CNN interview, Khalil flatly refused to condemn Hamas over the Oct. 7 attack \u2013 calling the question from host Pamela Brown \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d"

      "text": "Manhattan-sized interstellar object could be alien probe here to \u2018destroy us\u2019: Harvard scientist\nA Harvard physicist has asserted that new images of the Manhattan-sized interstellar object rocketing through our inner solar system back his claim that it\u2019s not a comet \u2014 but instead possibly an alien probe that may \u201cdestroy us.\u201d\nDr. Avi Loeb is pointing to apparent smoking guns emanating from 31/ATLAS \u2014 the object discovered in early July motoring past Earth which NASA officials have deemed a simple, though aberrational, comet.\n\u201cUsually, for comets, you see a tail trailing behind the object,\u201d Loeb told CNN Thursday.\n\u201cHere, the glow is actually in front of it. We\u2019ve never seen such a thing. A comet doesn\u2019t glow in front.\u201d\nLoeb then called the glow \u201cpuzzling\u201d in a blog post and implied that the object could be directed by an intelligent species with their sights set on our pale blue dot.\n\u201cIt may come to save us or destroy us. We\u2019d better be ready for both options and check whether all interstellar objects are rocks.\u201d\nLoeb cited two new images from The Hubble Space Telescope that show a concentration of light in front of the interstellar rock.\nThe images, taken on July 21, represent the most recent publicly available data on the 31/ATLAS.\nIn a blog post Wednesday, the theoretical astrophysicist wrote, \u201cThe existence of a glow ahead of 31/ATLAS but no evidence of gas molecules is puzzling.\u201d\nLoeb further reiterated claims made in a paper last month regarding the object\u2019s suspiciously specific flight path through our inner solar system.\n\u201cIt lies in the plane of the orbits of the planets around the sun to within five degrees,\u201d Loeb explained to CNN.\n\u201cIt will arrive closest to the sun when the Earth is on the opposite side. We won\u2019t be able to observe it. But that\u2019s the perfect time for it to maneuver.\u201d\nIn his recent paper, Loeb suggested that the pathway is ideal for observing and measuring the motion of the spheres in our solar system.\nThe object will come closest to the sun on Halloween and the intervening time will provide the best opportunity to glean information from the object.\n\u201cWe will have a better assessment of this probability within a month or two, once 31/ATLAS gets brighter and easier to observe as it approaches the Sun,\u201d Loeb wrote in a blog post last week.\nCongresswoman Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla) is answering Loeb\u2019s calls for increased and vigilant observation of 31/ATLAS.\n\u201cI\u2019m urging NASA to extend the Juno mission to study interstellar object 31/ATLAS,\u201d Rep. Luna wrote on X last week.\n\u201cThank you Avi Loeb for your continued dedication to exploring our universe. We must seize this opportunity for groundbreaking discovery.\u201d"

      "text": "Netanyahu believes occupying Gaza is the only way to save the hostages \u2013 but it will also start bloodiest phase of the war yet, experts warn\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is preparing to call for the full military occupation of the Gaza Strip to fight Hamas and free the hostages, according to multiple reports \u2013 but it could kick off the bloodiest phase of the war yet for the Jewish state.\nNetanyahu has long maintained that military might is the best way to finish off Hamas and rescue the remaining 50 hostages in Gaza, and the proposal calls for deploying Israel Defense Forces troops on the ground across the entire Palestinian territory, according to Israeli media.\n\u201cThis puts the IDF under new risks, with the soldiers having to deal with regular ambushes, improvised explosions and sniper fire from an insurgency,\u201d Colin Clarke, a counter-terrorism expert at the New York-based Soufan Group, told The Post. \u201cThis operation could also lay the groundwork for the next version of Hamas.\u201d\nThe Israeli government has confirmed about 450 deaths of IDF soldiers in 18 months of the Gaza ground war.\nIsrael already occupies about 75% of the Strip, with Gaza\u2019s nearly two million people huddled in the crowded pockets along the western shore.\nAny full-scale occupation of Gaza, would likely see troops go into Deir al-Balah, which currently stands as the only major city that has yet to see major ground operations.\nThe families of the 20 living hostages have said it\u2019s likely their loved ones are being held there \u2014 and they worry any military action would put them in grave danger.\nHamas has reportedly ordered its terrorists to execute their captives if Israeli soldiers are spotted nearby.\nReports began emerging on Monday evening that Netanyahu was ready to greenlight the full occupation of Gaza, with one senior official telling Israeli outlets that \u201cthe die has been cast.\u201d\nThe move to occupy Gaza came after Hamas published a pair of videos last week showing off the emaciated bodies of two Israeli hostages, with one digging his own grave and the other weeping as he begged for food and water.\nChristopher O\u2019Leary, a former senior FBI official who led many hostage recovery teams, said that while Hamas likely published the propaganda videos in hopes of pressuring Netanyahu to re-engage in the cease-fire talks, they likely had the opposite effect.\n\u201cIt showed off the brutality of Hamas to the world and gave Netanyahu the justification he needed to launch a full occupation of Gaza,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.\nThe logistics of occupying Gaza, however, are being questioned by at least 19 former Israeli military, intelligence and security chiefs, who publicly warned of unnecessary bloodshed earlier this week.\nMona Yacoubian, the director and senior adviser of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said the plan would put too much strain on the IDF, which likely doesn\u2019t \u201chave the bandwidth or ability to maintain the occupation.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen soldiers suffer from fatigue, death, PTSD, and suicide through the course of the war,\u201d she said. \u201cIsrael also has to contend with its other conflicts in Syria, Lebanon, against the Houthis in Yemen and, of course, Iran.\u201d\nYacoubian, Clarke, and O\u2019Leary also warned that an occupation would see insurgency rise in Gaza and more guerilla attacks on the soldiers stationed in the enclave.\n\u201cIf occupation becomes the norm, in a place with widespread destruction and hunger, we\u2019ll see insurgents rise up and strike back,\u201d said O\u2019Leary, who has also served on the Counterterrorism Division of the FBI.\n\u201cIt also risks Hamas regaining popular support and legitimacy from the people to defend them from the occupation force,\u201d he added.\nYacoubian warned that the IDF won\u2019t just have Hamas to contend with, as armed gangs from other factions would likely also rise to power to fight Israel.\n\u201cThis could birth groups more radical than Hamas,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a recipe for Israel to become embroiled in a forever war in Gaza.\u201d\nCritics have claimed that Netanyahu is pushing for a full occupation out of necessity to appease members of his right-wing coalition to keep his government from dissolving.\nMembers of Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet, like National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, have demanded Israel take Gaza and prioritize the destruction of Hamas over diplomatic means to rescue the hostages.\nYoram Cohen, a former director of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet intelligence agency, ultimately accused the prime minister on Sunday of echoing his cabinet member\u2019s \u201cfantasy\u201d of eradicating Hamas.\nClarke said that there is no clear path to fully eliminate Hamas, as evident by Israel\u2019s claim earlier this year that it killed 70% of the terror group\u2019s armed forces, only for the militants to repeatedly rebuild their numbers.\nClarke warned that without stated logistical goals that go beyond \u201cthe elimination of Hamas,\u201d Israel could find itself marred in a years-long occupation effort that fails to complete its mission, like what happened in southern Lebanon for 18 years back in 1982.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying Israel will be stuck in Gaza for the next 18 years, but they might be,\u201d he said."

      "text": "Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel \u2018intends to\u2019 take over all of Gaza\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday said his country will forge ahead on its plan to take over all of Gaza, despite widespread opposition \u2014 but added that he doesn\u2019t \u201cwant to keep it\u201d and pledged to \u201chand it over to Arab forces.\u201d\n\u201cWe intend to [take over all of Gaza] assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free of Gaza and to pass it to civilian governance that is not Hamas and not anyone advocating the destruction of Israel,\u201d Netanyahu said in an interview with Fox News.\nThe latter distinction would likely mean a country subscribing to Trump\u2019s 2020 Abraham Accords \u2014 which formalized diplomatic relations between Israel and Islamic nations like the United Arab Emirates, Bairahin, Morocco and Sudan \u2014 would be selected by the Jewish state.\nPresident Trump has not explicitly given Israel the go-ahead to take over the war-torn enclave, Netanyahu said \u2014 but the country doesn\u2019t need the US\u2019s permission to do so.\n\u201cHe understands it\u2019s Israel who\u2019s doing the fighting \u2014 it\u2019s not American soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cHe just says, \u2018I know Israel will do what it has to do.\u2019\u201d\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) currently control about 75% of the Gaza Strip, with the central coast city Deir El-Balah remaining the last hold-out that hasn\u2019t seen extensive military operations since the war began in October 2023.\nAbout 2 million Gazans are huddled there and in other pockets along the Mediterranean coast, with most intelligence indicating the 20 hostages who remain alive are likely held in Deir El-Balah.\nWord of Netanyahu\u2019s plan first broke Monday, just days after Hamas released twisted footage of two severly emaciated hostages, Evyatar David and Rom Braslavski.\nA skeletal David was filmed digging what Hamas said was his own grave in a dark tunnel, while Braslavski writhed in agony while begging for food and water.\nExperts have speculated Hamas might have released the images to spark another round of cease-fire talks. The haunting images may have instead convinced Israeli leadership that an all-out occupation was the only way to end the war.\n\u201cIt showed off the brutality of Hamas to the world and gave Netanyahu the justification he needed to launch a full occupation of Gaza,\u201d former senior FBI counterterrorism official Christopher O\u2019Leary previously told The Post.\nIsrael has been wary throughout the war of IDF incursions into unoccupied territory for fear of endangering surviving hostages, especially after Hamas began issuing orders to execute any prisoners if IDF troops drew too near.\nBut Netanyahu has apparently come to believe Hamas has no intention of freeing any of the remaining hostages, senior Israeli officials have said, and that taking them back by force is Israel\u2019s only remaining option.\nNot everybody is convinced a full occupation will be as decisive as Netanyahu hopes, with some experts cautioning the IDF doesn\u2019t have the resources to effectively hold the entire Gaza Strip.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen soldiers suffer from fatigue, death, PTSD, and suicide through the course of the war,\u201d said Mona Yacoubian, director and senior adviser of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\u201cIsrael also has to contend with its other conflicts in Syria, Lebanon, against the Houthis in Yemen and, of course, Iran,\u201d she added.\nYacoubian and others also think a full occupation was rife with risk for spawning new radical insurgents to replace an eradicated Hamas.\n\u201cIf occupation becomes the norm, in a place with widespread destruction and hunger, we\u2019ll see insurgents rise up and strike back,\u201d O\u2019Leary said, referring to the scenes and fears of civilian starvation that have been emerging from Gaza.\n\u201cThis could birth groups more radical than Hamas,\u201d Yacoubian added.\n\u201cThis is a recipe for Israel to become embroiled in a forever war in Gaza.\u201d"
