  "description": "US equity futures decline as President Trump reiterates his unilateral tariffs will come in a matter of weeks, feeding risk-off sentiment in markets. An Air India plane bound for London crashes carrying 242 passengers. Netflix's co-CEO Greg Peters says the streaming giant has lots of room to grow in Asia as it continues to build rather than buy other firms. Rising tensions in the Middle East fuel swings in the price of oil. Amy Wu Silverman of RBC says the risk of President Trump's tweets is infecting the volatility market. \u201cBloomberg Brief\u201d delivers the market news, data and analysis you need to set your agenda.

  "content": "> > IT IS 5:00 A.M. IN NEW YORK CITY. I HAVE YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF AND HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW. PRESIDENT TRUMP PLANS TO SEND LETTERS TO TRADING PARTNERS AHEAD OF THE JULY 9 DEADLINE. UNILATERAL LEVIES AHEAD. THE PENTAGON ORDERS SOME STAFF PUT OUT OF THEIR EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD AFTER IRAN THREATENED TO STRIKE U.S. BASES. MARKETS ARE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE 30 YEAR AUCTION AS CONCERNS MOUNT OVER THE DEFICITS AND TAX BILL. LET US TAKE A LOOK AT FUTURES. WE HAD THREE UP SESSION SMALLER BY A SMALL DOWN SESSION. NEW JERSEY POINTED TO ANOTHER LOWER SESSION TODAY, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME CATALYSTS THAT MIGHT IMPROVE HAS THE DAY GOES ON. THE NASDAQ AND FUTURES DOWN .1 -- .4% IN THE RUSSELL 2000 FUTURES, SMALLER AND MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES AFFECTED BY FUTURE TARIFFS AND THOSE ARE POINTED DOWN. LET US LOOKING -- LOOK AT THE BOND FUTURES BECAUSE WE ARE ALL EYES ON THE 30 YEAR OPTION. THE 10-YEAR NOTE -- THE 10 YEAR CAME IN FINE AND THE 30 YEAR IS DOWN TO 4.89. STILL, 10 BASIS POINTS HIGHER THAN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. THE TWO YEAR YIELD DOWN TO 4.93. -- 3.93. THE SALE OF THE DOLLAR CONTINUES, THAT IS THE THEME. LET US GET SOME STOCKS TO WATCH NOW. HERE IS JOE EASTON. JOE: WE HAVE SEEN A DROP IN BOEING FOLLOWING THIS TROUBLING NEWS OF A PLANE CRASH, A PLANE COMING FROM INDIA TO LONDON HAS CRASHED ACCORDING TO THE LATEST REPORTING. WE DO UNDERSTAND IT WAS A BOEING JET, SO WE SEE THAT STOCK JOB -- DROPPING BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN A DROP IN BOEING. WE HAVE A MOVE TO THE UPSIDE IN ORACLE TODAY. THE COMPANY SMASHING ITS EARNINGS FORECAST AND A LOT OF THIS TIED TO THE AI GROWTH AND MACHINERY. WE ARE SEEING THAT STOCK GAINING AND THE FORECASTS WERE BETTER THAN ANALYSTS WERE EXPECTING. THEN WE HAVE COREWEAVE WHICH IS POTENTIALLY STINGING SOME SHORT-SELLERS. IT WAS TARGETED BY SHORTSELLING, BUT IT HAS NEW INVOLVEMENT IN A PACT BETWEEN GOOGLE AND OPENAI, AND THAT IS LIFTING THE STOCK. WE WILL SEE A BIT OF A SHORT SQUEEZE ON THAT ONE. KEEP AN EYE ON THE TERMINAL BEFORE THE OPENING BELL THAT WILL WRAP UP ALL OF THIS NEWS BEFORE THE OPENING OF TRADING. VONNIE: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR KEEPING AN EYE ON THOSE STOCKS. WE WILL BE SPEAKING WITH RBC CAPITAL MARKETS ON THE BIGGEST RISKS TO VOLATILITY AND WHAT LIES AHEAD. LET US GET BACK TO THE HEADLINE STORY. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP PLANNING TO SET THE AGENDA FOR TRADING PARTNERS. HE WANTS TO SEND LETTERS TO THEM. JOINING US IS BRENDAN MURRAY. THIS IS AHEAD OF THE JULY THE NINTH DEADLINE SO WHAT ARE WE ANTICIPATING THAT THEY WILL LOOK LIKE? SEPARATE LETTERS FOR EVERY NATION AND DOES NOT INCLUDE PLACES LIKE JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA AS WELL? BRENDAN: IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE GETTING TWO MESSAGES, ONE FROM THE PRESIDENT TARGETED TOWARDS COUNTRIES THAT THINK THAT THEY CAN STALL FOR TIME AND THEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY GET A POSTPONEMENT OF THE 10% TARIFF. THAT IS EXPECTED TO SPRING HIGHER ON JULY 9. AND WE ARE ' S -- WE ARE HEARING TREASURY SECRETARY BESSENT SAY IF WE ARE NEGOTIATING IN GOOD FAITH AND WE WILL ROLL THAT OUT FOR YOU AND YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO FACE THAT TARIFF. WE ARE COMING DOWN TO CRUNCH TIME FOR THESE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THREE WEEKS OR SO TO GO. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THE WHITE HOUSE IS TRYING TO GET THE ONES MOVING THE FASTEST OVER THE FINISH LINE AND ENCOURAGE THE COUNTRIES DRAGGING THEIR FEET TO SPEED UP OR ELSE FACE THE HIGHER TARIFFS. VONNIE: YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF IT WILL BE THE WORST CASE SCENARIO OR IF WE SHOULD EXPECT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. IS THE E.U. EXEMPT GIVEN THAT WE KNOW THAT TALKS WILL CONTINUE JILL -- BEYOND JOHN NOT -- JULY 9? BRENDAN: THE YOU THINGS THAT -- THE E.U. THANKS THAT IT WILL GET SOME AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE TO CONTINUE TALKS FURTHER IN THE FUTURE PAST THE DEADLINE IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT RAISE THEIR TARIFF TO THE 50% THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS THREATENED. THE COMMERCE SECRETARY SAID THAT THE E.U. IS AT THE BACK OF THE LINE, SO APPARENTLY IT IS ONE OF THOSE COUNTRIES THAT THE U.S. WANTS TO -- WANTS THEM TO IMPROVE THE OFFER THAT THEY ARE PULLING TOGETHER. IN ORDER TO REACH A DEAL ON TIME. THERE IS AN INTERESTING PUSH AND PULL GOING ON BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND BRUSSELS. BRUSSELS THINGS IT CAN GET A POSTPONEMENT. SOME SORT OF TEMPORARY DEAL. THE U.S. IS SAYING YOU ARE ACTUALLY NOT AS FAR ALONG AS YOU THINK YOU ARE. VONNIE: IF WE MOVE TO THE OTHER THEATER OF THIS IT IS CHINA AND WE HAVE HAD TWO DAYS OF TALKS AND AN AGREEMENT. MORE CHATTER TO THE EFFECT THAT IT HAS STARTED ISSUING RARE EARTH LICENSES. HOW ARE RELATIONS? LESS FROSTY? BRENDAN: IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE HAS BEEN A MODEST DE-ESCALATION OF TENSIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA. THE U.S. CAME BACK AND PRESIDENT TRUMP POSTED THAT THIS WAS A DEAL AND IT WAS DONE AND IT WAS GOING TO HELP AMERICAN IMPORTERS, MEANING THE RARE EARTH MINERALS. AND CHINA SEEM TO VALIDATE THAT. SOME EXPORT LICENSES HAVE BEEN APPROVED WITHIN THE PAST 48 HOURS. THE U.S. IS GOING TO BE VERY CAREFULLY MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH THE GENEVA DEAL THAT BOTH SIDES DECIDED TO RECONFIRM THIS WEEK IN LONDON. IT IS A FAIRLY FRAGILE TRUCE, HOWEVER. WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE IF CHINA COMPLIES AND THE U.S. CAN VERIFY THAT, WHETHER THIS RELATIVE CALM CAN LAST MORE THAN A WEEK OR MORE. THEY HAVE A COUPLE MORE MONTHS YET BEFORE THE DEADLINE SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT. IT IS PLAYING OUT IN A WAY THAT AT ANY MOMENT IT COULD ESCALATE OR DE-ESCALATE. VONNIE: WATCHING EVERY MOMENT FOR US. THAT IS BRENDAN MURRAY. OVER IN THE MIDDLE EAST, TENSIONS ARE RISING AS THE U.S. ASKED SOME STAFF TO LEAVE THE EMBASSY AFTER IRAN THREATENED TO STRIKE AIRBASES IN THE REASON -- REGION IF TALKS FELL THROUGH. JOINING US FROM ISTANBUL IS PATRICK SYKES. THIS SEEMS TO BE ESCALATING AT LEAST PARTIALLY QUITE QUICKLY FROM THE SEMI OFFICIAL IRANIAN AGENCY WE HEAR THAT WE HAVE HEARD THE LAUNCH OF A NEW ENRICHMENT CENTER WHICH DOES NOT SOUND GOOD AND WE ARE GETTING THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT TELLING YOU -- TELLING GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES IN ISRAEL NOT TO TRAVEL. IS THIS ESCALATING? PATRICK: IT IS ESCALATING DAY. THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WILL LAUNCH ANOTHER URANIUM ENRICHMENT FACILITY WAS IN RESPONSE TO IRAN BEING CENSURED BY THE U.N. NUCLEAR WATCHDOG. IRAN HAD PROMISED TO RESPOND IN KIND IN SOME WAY BUT WE DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT WOULD DO SO. THAT WILL ONLY INCREASE CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS ENRICHING. AND THE NEXT THING TO WATCH FOR WILL BE WHETHER THEY FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE THREAT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE NONPROLIFERATION TREATY. THAT IS A DECADES LONG INTERNATIONAL TREATY THAT HAS RESTRICTED THE PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. IF IRAN FOLLOWS THROUGH, THAT WILL ONLY INCREASE THE CONCERNS THAT THE ATOMIC PROGRAM COULD BE WEAPONIZED. VONNIE: OBVIOUSLY WITH THIS TALKING ABOUT REGIONAL TENSIONS AND RESTRICTING AT LEAST DOMESTICALLY TRAVEL FOR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, THAT MEANS THAT THIS THEATER COULD BE VERY MUCH IN ISRAEL ' S COURT AS WELL. WILL ISRAEL RESPOND, DO YOU THINK? PATRICK: THE MAIN THING WAS THAT OVERNIGHT WE HAD A REPORT THAT ISRAEL WAS READY TO CARRY OUT AN OPERATION AGAINST IRAN ' S NUCLEAR SITE. THAT IS A THREAT THAT THEY HAVE HELD IN THE AIR FOR SOME TIME. I THINK REPORT COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN MANY TIMES OVER THE PAST 10 OR SO YEARS. OBVIOUSLY, THE TIMING IS IMPORTANT WHILE THE NUCLEAR DIPLOMACY TALKS ARE GOING ON. I THINK THAT, ULTIMATELY, IT IS RAMPING UP THE PRESSURE AHEAD OF THE NEXT BUNCH OF TALKS BETWEEN IRAN AND THE U.S. THAT IS SCHEDULED FOR THIS SUNDAY. WITH ALL OF THE BLUSTER, AND STAFF BEING WITHDRAWN AND POTENTIAL STRIKES ON THE HORIZON, THAT IS ALL POINTING TO A PARTICULARLY PIVOTAL ROUND OF TALKS AND THEY ARE REALLY KEEN TO SEE IF THEY CAN SQUARE THE CIRCLE TO SEE IF IRAN WILL BE ALLOWED TO RETAIN SOME KIND OF ENRICHMENT CAPACITY. VONNIE: IS IT POSSIBLE AND I KNOW THIS IS AN IMPOSSIBLE QUESTION FOR YOU TO ANSWER. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY HAVE ORDERED THE LAUNCH OF A NEW IRANIAN WRITTEN -- URANIUM ENRICHMENT CENTER WOULD THAT BE NECESSARY. SO TO WITHDRAW THAT ORDER MIGHT GIVE IRAN SOME AMMUNITION? PATRICK: FOR MANY PEOPLE, THE WHOLE NATURE OF THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS THAT. THEY HAVE INCREASED ENRICHMENT MASSIVELY. AND NOW THAT ENRICHMENT AND CAPABILITY, THOSE FACILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN SO HIGHLY DEVELOPED ARE WHAT IS ON THE TABLE TO BE PARTIALLY AND FULLY YET TO BE SEEN DISMANTLED UNDER THE TERMS OF A DEAL. SO EXACTLY, IT IS LEVERAGE FOR OUR ON TO USE. THE STUMBLING BLOCK IS STILL THE POINT WHICH IS THE ZERO-SUM POINT ABOUT WAY -- IF THEY CAN RETAIN SOME CAPACITY OR GIVE IT ALL UP. WHAT INTERN THEY GET IN EXCHANGE IF THAT COULD BE PARTIAL, THERE IS STILL A LOT OF VARIABLES TO BE NEGOTIATED. VONNIE: THANK YOU SO MUCH AND OFF OF THE BACK OF THAT WE ARE SEEING WTI AND BRENT DOWN. NOT AS PANICKED AS WE SAW YESTERDAY. THAT WAS PATRICK SYKES FOR US IN ISTANBUL. NOW TO OTHER TOP STORIES. THE U.K. ECONOMY IS TRYING TO BUY 0.3% IN APRIL, MORE THAN THE AVERAGE ESTIMATE. SHARP TAX INCREASES AND PRESIDENT TRUMP ' S TARIFF TRIGGERED THE BIGGEST CONTRACTION IN 18 MONTHS AND CAST DOUBT ON THE LABOR GOVERNMENT ' S PLAN TO DEPEND ON GROWTH. DEUTSCHE BANK ' S FIXED INCOME AND CURRENCY TRADERS OVERCOME A CHOPPY START AND SHOULD DELIVER A STRONGER SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR ACCORDING TO THE CEO WHO SPOKE AT THE INVESTMENT CONFERENCE. HE CALLED THE FIRST 15 DAYS IN APRIL A ROUGH START, WHICH IS WHEN THE TARIFF ANNOUNCEMENT JOLTED MARKETS. APOLLO IS TAKING A LEAF OUT OF JP MORGAN ' S BOOK. THEY TOLD INSPECTED -- PROSPECTIVE INVESTMENT BANKING CANDIDATES, THEY WILL NOT EXTEND OFFERS SAYING THAT GRADUATE SHOULD TAKE TIME TO DEEPEN THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF BUSINESS. THIS FOLLOWS A BACKLASH FROM BANKS OVER YOUNG RECRUITS ACCEPTING FUTURE OFFERS. LET US LOOK AT MARKETS. WE ARE SEEING THE S & P AND THE DOW AND THE NASDAQ 100 FUTURES POINTED LOWER IN THE EARLY GOING. MORE SO FOR THE RUSSELL 2000 AFTER A DOWN SESSION YESTERDAY. THE 10-YEAR YIELD AT 4.40 HAVING DROPPED SEVEN OR EIGHT BASIS POINTS. WE HAVE THE 30 SPREAD BELOW 19 BASIS POINTS. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO WATCH THE 30 YEAR AUCTION. LET US HEAD TO THE FOUNDERS FOR THEM WHERE FOUNDERS AND INVESTORS ARE GATHERING IN ENGLAND. JOHN IS WITH THE NETFLIX CO-CEO, GREG PETERS. GREG: BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO ESTIMATE -- THE MIKE JOHNSON AND TY, BUT WE THINK IT WILL BE BIG AND THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. AND FOR GLOBALLY BECAUSE IT HAS A BIG FOLLOWING IN MEXICO SO WE WILL HAVE LATIN AMERICAN VIEWERS. TO YOUR MAIN QUESTION, WE THINK OF THIS AS AN EVENT RATHER THAN SPORTS STRATEGY. WE WANT TO TRY AND DO BIG AND BUZZY EVENTS THAT PEOPLE ENJOY WATCHING AND THEN RELIVING THE STORY ABOUT TOGETHER. AND WE THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ADD AS VALUE TO SUBSCRIBERS. AND WE LOVE SPORTS, TO BE CLEAR. WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE PREMIER LEAGUE AND AMERICAN FOOTBALL AND MANY THINGS. AND WE DO CARRY THE AMERICAN FOOTBALL GAMES ON CHRISTMAS. AND WE ARE GOING TO DO THE WORLD CUP COMING UP. BUT, WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING THIS IN A PROFITABLE WAY. AND BEING VERY DISCIPLINED ABOUT THE EVENTS WE GO AFTER AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE NOT PAYING TOO MUCH FOR A WHOLE SEASON OF THE LEAD. THAT -- OF A LEAGUE. THAT IS THE BALANCE. JOHN: SO YOU ' RE NOT THINKING PACKAGES OF USC OR FORMULA ONE. YOU HEAR YOUR NAME BEING MENTIONED IN THESE MOMENTS. GREG: EVERYONE WOULD LOVE US TO HAVE -- TO BE A BIDDER. FORMULA ONE WE HAVE A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH -- WITH. WE WILL FIND A WAY TO DO SOMETHING BIGGER IN A WAY THAT WE THINK IS SUSTAINABLY PROFITABLE. THAT IS REALLY THE CRUX OF IT. WE HAVE DONE IT WITH WWE, WHICH IS AN EXAMPLE. WE HAVE A LONG-TERM DEAL WHERE WE FELT LIKE IF WE HELP GROW THIS PROPERTY WE AND THEY GET TO BENEFIT. THAT MIGHT BE A MODEL, BUT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THAT AND REMAIN DISCIPLINE. JOHN: YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO TO A NEWER SPORT? GREG: PERHAPS. I DO NOT NECESSARILY KNOW THAT THAT IS THE CASE. US FINDING OPPORTUNITIES WITH LEAGUES TO TAKE PARTICULAR GAMES THAT THEN WE CONDUCE ABOUT -- SOMETHING SPECIAL AROUND IT. THE AMERICAN FOOTBALL GAMES ON CHRISTMAS DAY, WE DID BEYONCE WITH, WHICH MADE IT MORE SPECIAL. THOSE ARE THE KIND OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR. IF WE CAN HELP ROW THE VIEWERSHIP OF THE SPORT THOSE ACTIVITIES, THAT IS GOOD FOR THE LEAGUE AS WELL. SO THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND A GOOD DEAL AROUND IT. SO IT IS FINDING THOSE SPECIFIC INSTANCES. JOHN: DO YOU THINK THE OLD MODEL OF SPORTS IS DEAD AND IT MIGHT MOVE -- THE THING YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IS A MORE EVENT AN INDIVIDUAL GAME MODEL. GREG: I WOULD NOT SAY THAT THE OLD METAL -- THE OLD MODEL IS DEAD BECAUSE THERE ARE BIDDERS FOR WHAT WE SEE. I WOULD SAY WE DO NOT KNOW A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK FOR US IN THAT SPECIFIC WAY AND WE ARE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT. BUT, TO BE CLEAR, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROPERTIES THAT WE BID FOR -- BID FOR WORK FOR THE BUSINESS AS WELL AS OTHERS. JOHN: THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE THE MOST PROFITABLE AND YOU ARE NOT THAT INTERESTED IS INTERESTING. THE OTHER THING THAT HAPPENED THIS WEEK IS WARNER ' S BROTHERS AND DISCOVERY SPINNING OFF ITS CABLE CHANNELS. THAT IS A HUGE THING. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THAT AND WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? E.U. WE ARE GOING -- GREG: WE ARE GOING THROUGH AN EVOLUTION AND GETTING TO THE NEXT PHASE OF MATURITY WHERE MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CONSUMERS EXPECT FROM THE BUSINESS. EVERYTHING IS MOVING TO STREAMING AND ON-DEMAND AND IT IS CLEAR THAT CONSUMERS WANT THAT. AND THEN THEY HAVE TO RATIONALIZE THEIR BUSINESS AND WE ARE DEFINITELY SEEING THE RESULTS OF THAT. THESE ARE INEVITABLE AND LONG PREDICTABLE AND UNFORCASTED CHANGES. I FEEL THAT WE WERE LUCKY, I WOULD SAY IN THE FACT THAT WE CAME INTO THIS NEW ECOSYSTEM STARTING WITH THE NEW MODEL, SO WE DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE THE COMPLEXITIES OR DIFFICULTIES OF HAVING TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE TRANSITION BECAUSE WE HAVE A LEGACY BUSINESS MODEL. JOHN: DO YOU EXPECT TO SEE MERGERS BETWEEN THE LEGACY PLAYERS? GREG: THERE IS AN INEVITABLE LOGIC TO THAT. AND THEN YOU GET TO EVERY MERGER IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. AND SOMETIMES IT PRESENTS INTERESTING REGULATORY COMPLEXITIES THAT ARE OFTEN THE CASE AND THEN THE TWO COMPANIES HAVE TO DECIDE IF IT MAKES SENSE. AND I SHOULD NOTE THAT THE TRACK RECORD AROUND THESE LARGE MERGERS IS MAYBE NOT AMAZING. SO, I THINK FOLKS WANT TO THINK LONG AND HARD IF THEY ARE IN A POSITION TO DO IT WELL. JOHN: NETFLIX WOULD LIKELY NOT BE A PLAYER IN BUYING SOME OF THESE? GREG: WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO EXPLORE ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES. JOHN: AND THEN REJECT THEM. GREG: TO DO DUE DILIGENCE. BUT THEN ALSO HAVE A COLD, HARD, DISCIPLINED LOOK AT DO WE THINK WE CAN DO THIS WELL. LIKE OUR TRACK RECORD IS THAT WE ARE BUILDERS, NOT BUYERS. WE ARE NOT PARTICULARLY GREAT AT ACQUIRING COMPANIES AND THAT IS NOT THE DEMONSTRATED PRACTICE OR CAPABILITY. I THINK WE SHOULD BRING THAT PERSPECTIVE AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT THESE. JOHN: IN TERMS OF COMPETITION, DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE STREAMERS AS COMPETITION OR YOUTUBE? GREG: WE THINK WE ARE IN A MASSIVELY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WE HAVE COMPETITION FROM TRADITIONAL, AND NEW STREAMERS AND COMPETITION FROM UGC PRODUCTS LIKE YOUTUBE AND TIKTOK. GAMES IS A SORT OF COMPETITION. INCREASINGLY WE SEE YOUTUBE AS A STRONG COMPETITOR FOR TIME AND ATTENTION AND THEY DO A GOOD JOB OF ACCUMULATING THAT. WE THINK OUR RESPONSE AND OUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE -- THAT WE ARE DISTINCT AND CLEAR. THE JOB THAT WE DO BOTH FOR CREATORS IN TERMS OF GIVING THEM THE RESOURCES REQUIRED TO PRODUCE AMAZING STORIES AND A PLATFORM TO GIVE A BIG AUDIENCE. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE CONSUMERS, TO GIVE THEM A PARTICULAR KIND OF STORYTELLING THAT THEY DO NOT SEE ON YOUTUBE. BUT ALSO, MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE EXPANDING THE PORTFOLIO AND THE PLACES THAT WE CAN OPERATE. THE EASE OF ACCESS AND BEING ABLE TO ENGAGE IN A WAY THAT GIVES THEM AN EXPERIENCE THAT IS ALSO COMPETITIVE WITH YOUTUBE. JOHN: YOUR CO-CEO FAMOUSLY SAID THAT YOUTUBE IS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE GO TO KILL TIME. NETFLIX IS WHERE PEOPLE SPEND TIME. THERE ARE SOME SIGNS THAT YOU ARE RECONSIDERING THAT BECAUSE YOUTUBE IS A PLACE THAT IS COMPETING WITH YOU SLIGHTLY MORE DIRECTLY. GREG: THEY ARE TRYING TO MOVE UP AND OUR JOB IS TO DEFEND THE SPACE. HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT? WE THINK THAT YOUTUBE IS A PLACE FOR GREAT STORYTELLERS AND GREAT STORYTELLERS THAT ARE DOING THE KIND OF STORYTELLING THAT WE THINK WE ARE GOOD AT. AND OUR JOB IS TO SAY WE THINK NETFLIX IS A GREAT PLACE FOR YOU TO GO AND TELL THOSE STORIES IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO DO ON YOUTUBE AND THAT IS AN EXAMPLE. WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO THINK ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF OUR MEMBER EXPERIENCE IN THE WAYS WHERE THERE IS A BROADER RANGE OF CONTENT AND IT STILL FEELS LIKE NETFLIX WHICH YOU WOULD EXPECT TO GET. AND WAYS THAT MAKES IT EASIER TO GET INTO THE SPACE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE SOMETIMES, THERE IS IMMENSE VALUE PUT ON GETTING A DEEPLY ENGAGING STORY. AND THAT HAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PAYOFF. YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE ECONOMICS AND THE BUSINESS MODEL. ALSO THAT CAN SEEM LIKE A HURDLE. YOU WANT TO ABROAD IN THAT SPACE AND MAKE IT EASIER EVERY YEAR. JOHN: OUT OF THE STREAMING SERVICES DO YOU EXPECT THAT NUMBER TO COME DOWN? IF WE MET EACH OTHER DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE DOWN TO FEWER? GREG: LOOK AT THE WAY THE ENDED -- THE INTERNET WORKS AND IT TENDS TO SORT AND TWO BUCKETS AND BENEFITS ON SCALE SO WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THE NUMBER SHOULD BE SMALLER. THERE IS A SPACE WHERE WE ARE VERY TARGETED AND VERY NICHE SERVICES THAT CAN OPERATE A GREAT LOWER COST AND THAT CAN BE QUITE EFFECTIVE AS WELL SO MY GUESS IS THAT IS WHERE WE LAND. JOHN: ONE OF THE JOYS OF THE LIFE THAT YOU DID NOT ANTICIPATE IS TARIFFS. WE HAVE DONALD TRUMP COMING TO YOU AND SAYING THAT HE WANTS TO PUT 100% TARIFFS ON FOREIGN PRODUCTION COMING INTO THE U.S.. YOU MAKE A LOT OF STUFF AROUND THE WORLD AND I SUSPECT HE WOULD BE MORE AFFECTED THAN MOST. WHAT IS YOUR STRATEGY ON THAT? GREG: WE ARE WAITING FOR A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN DETAIL SO IT IS HARD TO RESPOND IN ABSENCE. SO WE ARE IN STANDBY MODE AND IF WE SEE SOMETHING WE CAN COMMENTS MORE FULLY. JOHN: DO YOU WORRY ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT GETTING WRAPPED UP IN BIGGER QUARRELS WITH CHINA AND ALL THOSE SORTS OF THINGS? GREG: I THINK WHEN ENTERTAINMENT IS A UNIVERSAL PRODUCT IN A SENSE THAT ALL HUMANS WANT STORIES. I SEE THAT AS A STRONG REASON FOR OPTIMISTIC PERSPECTIVE ON THE INDUSTRY. AND THEN WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD TO THINK ABOUT STORYTELLING AS HAVING A HIGHLY LOCAL COMPONENT, WHICH IS THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT CULTURAL PERSPECTIVES AND PERSPECTIVE OF STORYTELLERS. MOSTLY OUR JOB IS TO TRY AND GIVE STORYTELLERS AROUND THE WORLD IN MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PLACES AND LANGUAGES THE OPPORTUNITY IS TO TELL OUR STORIES. AND THE WEALTH AND DIVERSITY HAS SERVED US QUITE WELL. JOHN: YOU WOULD CONTINUE REGARDLESS BECAUSE YOU NEED THAT LOCAL CONTENT. GREG: THAT IS RIGHT. LOCAL CONSUMERS WANT TO HEAR AUTHENTIC STORIES FROM THE PLACE AND CULTURE THAT THEY EXIST IN. AND SOMETIMES THOSE STORIES BECOME LARGE GLOBAL PHENOMENONS. WE DEFINITELY THINK YOU HAVE TO TEST -- TO TELL THE AUTHENTIC STORY LOCALLY AND SOMETIMES IF YOU ' D TELL IT WELL IT GOES GLOBAL. JOHN: WHAT HAPPENS IN TERMS OF AI. THERE BEEN A LOT OF STUFF ABOUT HOW AI CAN CHANGE THE WAY THAT FILMS AND TV IS PRODUCED. WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT TO CHANGE MOST OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS? GREG: ONE, THERE IS A LONG GAP BETWEEN WHAT YOU CAN SEE IN A DEMO AND WHAT YOU GET TO WHEN YOU HAVE TO PUT SOMETHING IN PRODUCTION AND HAVE PREDICTABLE OUTPUTS. WE ARE IN THAT SPACE OR IS A LOT OF WORK. WE ARE SEEING TOOLS THAT HELP CREATORS IN NONPRODUCTION PRODUCT -- PART OF THE PROCESS LIKE PRE-VISUALIZATION OR SHOT COMPOSITION AND THINGS IN THAT REGARD. I THINK THAT GETS TO REALLY OUR PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT AI WILL DO, WHICH IT WILL GIVE AN INCREASINGLY EFFECTIVE SET OF TOOLS THAT STILL HAS THE CREATOR AT THE CENTER. I VERY MUCH BELIEVE THAT STORYTELLING IS A HARD THING TO GO DO. IT IS UNEVENLY AND RARE COMMODITY IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE HUMANS. THE GREAT STORYTELLERS WILL STILL BE AT THE CENTER FOR CREATING GREAT STORIES. JOHN: WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE VALUE IN NETFLIX, WHERE IS IT? THE SUBSCRIBER BASE OR THE IP? GREG: WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD MORE AND MORE VALUE IN THE IP THAT WE HAVE. WE ARE YOUNG SO IF YOU LOOK AT OUR PEERS THEY HAVE ENORMOUS SNIPER -- ENORMOUS LIBRARIES AND MUCH MORE VALUABLE IP CATALOG. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT OUR TRACK RECORD WE HAVE ONLY BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LITTLE BIT OVER A DECADE AND WE HAVE GOTTEN SOME PROPERTIES LIKE YOU THINK ABOUT \" STRANGER THINGS \" AND \" WEDNESDAY. \" THESE ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF US BUILDING IP. WE HAVE OVER HALF A BILLION PEOPLE ON THE PLANET WHO COME TO US TO SEEK TO BE ENTERTAINED. AND OUR JOB IS TO FULFILL THAT AND IF WE DO A GOOD JOB THAT IS A VALUABLE BUSINESS. JOHN: THERE HAS BEEN A SHIFT AND IN A WAY IT WAS ABOUT GROWING SUBSCRIBERS AND THAT IS WHAT EVERYONE FOCUSED ON AND NOW THERE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT PROFIT AND RETURNS. AND ONE OBVIOUS WAY YOU COULD BECOME MORE PROFITABLE IS TO PUT UP PRICES. TO WHAT EXTENT THAT THE PART OF THE STRATEGY GOING FORWARD? GREG: WE HAVE LONG HAD THE PERSPECTIVE THAT IT WAS SMART IN THE BUSINESS TO SORT OF ALWAYS GROW MARGIN A LITTLE BIT EVERY YEAR. BECAUSE THAT WAS BUILDING IN THAT DISCIPLINE ABOUT HOW WE WANTED TO BUILD A MORE SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS. WE HAVE BEEN DOING THAT FOR QUITE SOME TIME. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT LEVERS LIKE GROWING SUBSCRIBERS IS ONE OF THEM. BEING ABLE TO RAISE PRICES BECAUSE WE PUT IN MORE VALUE TO THE SUBSCRIBERS AND WE THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO GO BACK SO WE CAN REINVEST INTO IMPROVING THE VALUE OF SERVICES. WE HAVE ADVERTISING THAT WE HAVE ADDED TO THE MIX. AND NOW WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH AMAZING BRANDS AND TO GIVE THEM THE CAPABILITY TO TELL THE STORY ABOUT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY ARE DELIVERING TO CONSUMERS THAT ARE INTERESTED BECAUSE WE ARE TARGETING INCREASINGLY. AND AS MANY BUSINESSES DO, WE ARE GETTING INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED AND HAVING MORE LEVERS AT HAND TO TRY AND CONTINUE WHICH IS TO BUILD A BETTER BUSINESS. JOHN: HOW MUCH PRICING POWER DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE? TO DOUBLE THE FEES? IT IS MUCH EASIER TO DOUBLE THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE THAN DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS? GREG: IT DEPENDS ON THE CONTRARY. WE THINK ABOUT THAT ANSWER AS DIFFERENT FOR COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. TO BE CLEAR, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF NETFLIX CAPABLE HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAVE EVERYTHING THEY NEED TO SIGN UP THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY SIGNED UP YET SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. WE DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THIS, AND WE REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS AS INTERACTION WITH CONSUMERS AND MEMBERS THAT WE DELIVER MORE VALUE. THAT IS THE THING THAT GOVERNS HOW WE CHANGE PRICES. JOHN: IN TERMS OF THE OTHER WAY OF GROWING BUSINESS, IT IS TO GET SUBSCRIBERS. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS MOVING MORE TO ASIA THAN TO EUROPE? I THINK EUROPE IS YOUR BIGGEST MARKET AT THE MOMENT? IF WE PUT IT TOGETHER. GREG: WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SUBSCRIBER GROWTH IN EVERY COUNTRY WE OPERATED SO IT IS NOT LIKE WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE DONE GROWING. IF WE LOOK AT THE OPEN OPPORTUNITY AVAILABLE TO US, THERE IS A LOT IN ASIA. WE ARE YOUNGER IN ASIA AND WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO TO PROVE THE OFFERING. AND WE THINK ABOUT HOW OFTENTIMES IN COUNTRIES START IN A CENTER AND HOW IT IS PRESENTED TO MARKET AND THEY EXPAND OUT. MANY COUNTRIES AND WE HAVE A LOT MORE ROOM TO GROW. JOHN: TO BE MORE SPECIFIC ON THAT. ARE THERE SPECIFIC COUNTRIES THAT YOU ARE TARGETING OR IS IT ACROSS THE WHOLE REGION? GREG: THERE ARE TONS OF OPPORTUNITIES. WE LAUNCHED IN JAPAN AND THAT IS THE FURTHEST ALONG. JOHN: YOU WERE BASED. GREG: AND WE HAD A GREAT HONOR TO LAUNCH THE SERVICE AND GET IT ROLLING. KOREA IS ANOTHER GREAT EXAMPLE AND I THINK WE ARE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS. INDIA, WE HAVE SEEN GOOD ACCELERATION AND SUBSCRIBER GROWTH. JOHN: CAN YOU CHARGE THE FEES IN INDIA THAN THE U.S.? GREG: WE THINK AS PRICES AS LOCAL SPECIFIC SO WE CHARGE DIFFERENT FEES AND THEY ARE LOWER IN INDIA AS WELL. I WOULD SAY THERE IS TONS OF GROWTH THROUGHOUT ASIA AND MORE WORK FOR US TO DO. JOHN: THE REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND THE STREAMING SERVICES IS YOU TEND TO BE MORE GLOBAL. AMAZON MIGHT BE AS WELL. APPLE IS PATCHY. YOU HAVE THE OTHER PEOPLE BEHIND YOU. THE STANDARD OLD HOLLYWOOD WINES. GREG: IN TERMS OF THAT, WE ARE THE MOST GLOBAL AND PART OF THAT IS BEING AVAILABLE FOR CONSUMERS. ALSO, BEING AVAILABLE THERE IS A DEEP SET OF WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? ARE YOU GOOD AT PAYMENTS AND DO YOU HAVE MANY LOCAL PARTNERS AND PARTNERSHIPS RUNNING INCREDIBLY DEEP, WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO MAKING SURE THAT THE SERVICE IS AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. A BIG PART OF BEING GLOBAL IS A CONTENT OFFERING. WE HAVE PRODUCED IN MORE THAN 50 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, AND THAT IS CRITICAL TO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF STORIES THAT THOSE LOCAL NUMBERS ARE PLAYING HERE. JOHN: YOU LOOK AT THE STANDARD NETFLIX SCREEN AND WE ARE USED TO IT, WILL THAT CHANGE AT ALL? GREG: WE ROLLED OUT A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR A WHILE WHERE WE HAVE HAD THE SAME ESSENTIALLY USUAL -- USER INTERFACE STRUCTURE FOR 10 YEARS AND WE JUST CAME UP WITH A NEW ONE, WHICH WILL SET UP THE BUSINESS FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS WORTH OF INNOVATION. IT SUPPORTS NEW CONTENT TYPES SO WE MENTIONED THE LIVE THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING AND IT WILL DO A BETTER JOB OF LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT THIS IS COMING AND SO THAT THEY REMEMBER AND THEY WILL WATCH AND TIME. GAMES IS ANOTHER INTERESTING SPACE WHERE WE WILL DELIVER MORE GAMES TO THE TV SO THAT IS EXCITING. THERE IS TONS OF IMPROVEMENTS. AND ONE OF THE MAIN BENEFITS IS THAT THIS NEW USER INTERFACE WILL BE ABLE TO RESPOND DYNAMICALLY TO WHAT YOU WANT IN THE MOMENT. WE DEFINITELY SEE NOT ONLY DO WE PERSONALIZE SO YOUR NETFLIX WILL LOOK DIFFERENT FROM MY NETFLIX YOU HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS IN THE MOMENT WHETHER IT IS SUNDAY AFTERNOON WITH THE FAMILY VERSUS THURSDAY NIGHT WITH YOURSELF. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UI IS DOING THAT JOB VERY WELL. JOHN: SO WE ARE GOING TO END UP WITH A MORE PERSONALIZED NETFLIX AND IT WILL BE A PLACE WHERE THE THING THAT WE ALWAYS LOOK FOR ON THE NEW SIDE WHICH IS TO PERSONALIZED NEWS AND YOU THINK PEOPLE HAVE TRIED AND FAILED. AND WILL ENTERTAINMENT BE THE PLACE WHERE WE SEE THAT FIRST? GREG: WE ARE HIGHLY PERSONALIZED. THE TITLE SELECTION WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT. WE PRESENT TITLES DIFFERENTLY. EVEN IF WE GET DIFFERENT, \" BLACKED OF \" IS AN -- \" BLACK DOVE \" GIVES AN INCREDIBLE STORY BUT, WE ALSO WANT THE FORM AND FUNCTION TO BE PERSONALIZED AS WELL. SO IT IS TAILORED AND OPTIMIZED TO DOING THE JOB THAT YOU NEED IN YOUR PARTICULAR MOMENT VERSUS A DIFFERENT MOMENT THAT YOU SHOW UP FOR VERSUS I NEEDED. JOHN: THANK YOU. WE TALKED ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT THAT \" BLACK DOVE \" WILL BE DIFFERENT FOR BOTH OF US. VONNIE: THAT WAS A NETFLIX CO-CEO GREG PETERS WITH JOHN MICKLETHWAIT AT THE FOUNDERS FORM IN ENGLAND. YOU CAN CONTINUE TO FOLLOW OUR PANELS BY TYPING LIVE  ON YOUR TERMINALS. IT IS JUST -- TARIFF WARNING, PRESIDENT TRUMP PLANS TO SEND LETTERS TO TRADING PARTNERS SETTING UNILATERAL LEVIES. MIDDLE EAST TENSIONS. THE PENTAGON ORDER SOME STAFF TO PULLOUT OUT OTHER EMBASSY IN BAGHDAD AFTER IRAN THREATENED TO STRIKE U.S. AIRBASES. MARKETS KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE 30 YEAR TREASURY AUCTION AS CONCERNS MOUNT OVER U.S. DEFICITS AND PRESIDENT TRUMP ' S TAX BILL. LET US LOOK AT WHERE WE STAND. WE ARE TAKING ANOTHER LEG LOWER WHICH IS DOWN MORE THAN 7%. THE S & P FUTURES POINTED TO A DROP OF POINT 4% AFTER A DOWN DAY BY ABOUT A QUARTER OF A PERCENT. THE NASDAQ 100 SHOWING A DROP AT ABOUT POINT 3% ON THE FUTURES AND THE RUSSELL 2000 ON THESE TARIFF LETTERS GOING OUT IN THE NEXT ONE TO TWO WEEKS MIGHT BE AFFECTING SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZE BUSINESSES DOWN .75% IN TERMS OF FUTURES. TAKING A QUICK LOOK AT THE BOND MARKETS BECAUSE WE SAW A BIG RALLY YESTERDAY AND THAT IS REFLECTED IN THE YIELDS. THE TWO YEAR YIELD IS SENSITIVE AND THE MARKET IS PRICING AND 47 BASIS POINTS BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. AND THAT ALL CRUCIAL 30 YEAR YIELD IS DOWN ALMOST 10 BASIS POINTS FROM A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND SEVERAL BASIS POINTS AFTER THE SUCCESSFUL AUCTION. WE WILL SEE HOW THE TRADERS FEEL HOW THOSE 30 YEARS ARE VALUED WHEN WE LOOK AT THE OPTION. BACK TO BREAKING NEWS, BOEING IS DOWN 7%. AN AIR INDIA BOEING 787 AIRCRAFT CARRYING 242 PASSENGERS AND CREW HAS CRASHED. THE PLANE WAS TRAVELING FROM GUJARAT TO LONDON, GATWICK. WE ARE JOINED BY SAID PHILIP. GIVE US THE LATEST. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HOW THIS PLANE CRASH AND SO ON? SID: GOOD MORNING. WE DO NOT KNOW YET ABOUT HOW THIS PLANE CRASHED OR WHAT WENT WRONG. ESSENTIALLY IT WAS CATASTROPHIC FOR THE AIRLINE AND WE ARE TRYING TO SEE IN THE NEXT COMING DAYS, WE WILL HAVE MORE INSIGHT INTO WHAT WENT WRONG. IT WAS A BOEING 787 AND WAS 12 YEARS OLD AND WAS OPERATED BY AIR INDIA AND WAS FLYING FROM NEW DELHI. IT WAS ON ITS TAKEOFF FOR LONDON WHEN THE CRASH OCCURRED. IT WAS MINUTES AFTER TAKING OFF THAT WE HAD THE CRASH AT 625 FEET OFF OF THE GROUND. AND IT WAS AT TAKEOFF SPEED. WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE DETAILS ARE OF THE INCIDENT AND WHAT WENT WRONG. IT IS A CATASTROPHIC INCIDENT FOR THE AIRLINE. AND WE WILL HAVE TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT WENT WRONG WITH THE AIRCRAFT OR WHETHER IT WAS A TECHNICAL OR PILOT ERROR. WE DO NOT KNOW THE DETAILS. IT IS A SIGNIFICANT CRASH. VONNIE: IT LITERALLY JUST HAPPENED AND RESCUE OPERATIONS ARE UNDERWAY. WE ARE HEARING FROM A SPOKESPERSON THAT THAT AIRPORT IS CLOSED. GIVE US A CONTEST -- SOME CONTACTS, AIR INDIA IS THE LARGEST AIR CARRIER AND IT TRAVELS IN AND OUT AIRPORTS ALL ACROSS INDIA AND THE GUJARAT REGION. TELL US MORE ABOUT THE DREAMLINER. AS I UNDERSTAND THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST INCIDENT FOR THAT AIRCRAFT. SID: YES. THE 787 DREAMLINER IS VERY ADVANCED. IT IS THE FIRST EVER FATAL CRASH FOR THE AIRCRAFT. AND SO, THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT MOMENT FOR THE MODEL, WHICH HAS SO FAR HAD AN UNBLEMISHED SAFETY RECORD. WE ARE WORKING TO SEE WHAT WENT WRONG. AIR INDIA IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A REVITALIZATION AFTER IT WAS TAKEN OVER BY AN INDIA STARTER GROUP IT WAS STATE OWNED AND NOW IT IS OWNED BY THE STARTER GROUP AND THEY ARE IN THE MIDST OF EXPANDING ITS FLEET AND THEY ANNOUNCED ORDERS FOR 430 AIRCRAFT. AND SO NOW THEY ARE FLYING TO MORE DESTINATIONS BOTH WITHIN INDIA AND AROUND THE WORLD. WE ARE LOOKING TO SEE WHAT THIS IMPACT MEANS FOR THE CARRIER AND THEIR GROWTH PLANS AS WELL, LONGER-TERM. VONNIE: OUR THOUGHTS ARE WITH EVERYONE INVOLVED INSIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT AND OUTSIDE AS WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT IS OUR AIRLINE EXPERT AND WE WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED AS WE LEARN MORE. A QUICK CHECK OF THE MARKETS WITH FUTURES POINTED TO A LOWER OPEN ABOUT .4% PER INDEX AFTER A DOWN DAY YESTERDAY BUT THREE UP DAYS PREVIOUSLY. THE 10 YEAR YIELD AT 4.39. WE ARE LOOKING AT A SPREAD BELOW 90 BASIS POINTS, 89 BASIS POINTS AND THAT BODES POTENTIALLY WELL FOR THE 30 YEAR AUCTION AND ALL EYES WILL BE ON THE AUCTION. JOINING US TO TALK THROUGH THE MARKET MOVES IS AMY WU SILVERMAN. AMY, TALK TO US ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF THE MARKET AT THE MOMENT. WE HAVE A VIX AT AROUND 18 AND A MOVE INDEX THAT IS -- I DO NOT WANT TO SAY COMPLACENT, BUT IS IT A COMPLACENT MARKET? AMY: IT CERTAINLY FEELS THAT WAY BUT THEN WHEN YOU GET THE TRUMP TWEET RISK THAT COMES AND GOES IT FEELS LIKE A VOLATILITY POTHOLE. ONE THING INTERESTING ABOUT THE OPTIONS MARKET AND WHAT IS IT SAYING IS THAT SHORT-TERM WE HAVE SEEN THE VIX COME DOWN AND IT IS BELOW THE PSYCHOLOGICAL 20 HANDLE. WHEN YOU LOOK THREE MONTHS OUT OR SIX MONTHS OUT YOU SEE A DECENT AMOUNT OF ELEVATION AND VOLATILITY AND THIS IS ON IW M, THE SMALL-CAP PROXY. AND IT IS TELLING YOU THAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED AND PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE TIMING AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CANNED KICKING. VONNIE: I LOVE HOW YOU CHARACTERIZE THEM AS POTHOLES. WHERE DO YOU SEE THE SPIKES MORE AND THAT IS BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETS OUT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ANTICIPATING OR WHEN WE HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT IRAN ADDING IN A NEW ENRICHMENT SITE, OR IS IT SOMETHING, EVEN AS MAYBE NOT CENTRAL TO DOMESTIC AFFAIRS AS A RIFT BETWEEN ELON MUSK AND DONALD TRUMP? AMY: YOU WOULD THINK RATIONALLY A SOURCE OF MAJOR GEOPOLITICAL TENSION LIKE THAT WOULD CAUSE THE VOLATILITY SPIKES. IT IS THE LATTER, THE BREAKDOWN OF A BROMANCE OR WHETHER OR NOT TRUMP WILL NOT TACO OUT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE CALLING HIM A CHICKEN. IT FEELS SILLY BUT THERE ARE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. I HAVE TO TELL MY BAD VOLATILITY JOKE WHICH IS THERE IS THIS OTHER GREEK AND THIS IS THE RISK OF TRUMP ' S TWEETS INFECTING IMPLIED VOLATILITY. IT IS RELATED TO THE ON TO -- UNPREDICTABILITY THAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU HAVE ONE PERSON SO DETERMINATIVE FOR POLICY RATHER THAN SOMETHING MORE TECTONIC LIKE GEOPOLITICAL RISK THAT WILL MOVE MORE SLOWLY. VONNIE: THAT IS FASCINATING AND TAKES ME BY SURPRISE. WHAT IS THE PICTURE AROUND JULY 9 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TERM STRUCTURE AND VOLATILITY. IS THERE ANYTHING SURROUNDING JULY 9 OR IS THE MARKET ASSUMING WE WILL HAVE MORE ANSWERS. AMY: IF YOU ASKED ME A FEW DAYS AGO I WOULD SAY THE MARKET IS BELIEVING THAT THIS FRAMEWORK WILL GET PUSHED OUT WHERE WE WILL GET A DEAL THAT THE MARKET IS RELATIVELY HAPPY WITH. THAT HAS BEEN CHANGING A LITTLE AND THIS IS WHAT I MEAN BY TRUMP CONTINUES TO KEEP INVESTORS ON THEIR TOES AND YOU CONTINUE TO SEE THE LITTLE BIT OF SPIKE AND WE HAVE EARLY DAYS. AND WHETHER OR NOT WE GET MORE OF THAT TWEET VOMIT. WHEN I TALKED TO INVESTORS WHAT THEY SAY IS THEY DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE GUARDRAILS IN PLACE AND IT MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE ON THE S & P IN TERMS OF EQUITY MARKETS BUT PERHAPS THE TRUMP PUT IS ON THE BOND MARKET. AND ALSO SCOTT BESSENT HAS SEEN THAT WE HAVE SEEN THE LAST SPIKE DURING LIBERATION DAY. IT IS INTERESTING TO ME WHEN PEOPLE ARE CALLING FOR THE PEAK AND WHO KNOWS. THEY ARE WATCHING THE MARKET. VONNIE: HOW MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE IS IT TO BUY VOLATILITY PROTECTION AND WHERE ARE PEOPLE LOOKING FOR IT? AMY: WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IF YOU HAD ASKED ME THIS QUESTION VERSUS A FEW YEARS AGO I WOULD SAY THINGS LOOK RELATIVELY MORE EXPENSIVE, BUT IN THE CONTEXT WE ARE IN, THE U.S. IS TRYING TO MAKE THIS GENERATIONAL CHANGE IN TARIFF POLICY. IF YOU GO BACK TO APRIL 2, IT HAS GOTTEN A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE. IF YOU LOOK ON A FIVE YEAR BASIS AT TAIL RISK SO THE RISK OF A 10% DRAWDOWN, WE ARE IN THE 40TH PERCENTILE SO BELOW AVERAGE. AND THAT HAS COME DOWN FROM THE 99TH PERCENTILE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE WEEK AFTER APRIL 2. VONNIE: GIVE US AN UPDATE ON THE RETAIL TRADER AND THE VOLATILITY THAT WE SEE IN CERTAIN TIMES OF THE DAY THAT ARE VERY LIKELY BOTS TO A LARGE DEGREE. SHOULD WE EXPECT MORE OF THAT AND IS IT TROUBLING AND A CONCERN THAT THE REST OF US SHOULD HAVE? AMY: I THINK THAT YOU CAN CALL IT BOTS OR SYSTEMATIC TRADING AND I THINK THAT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE OF WHAT IS NORMAL, ESPECIALLY IN EQUITY MARKETS. IN TERMS OF A RETAIL UPDATE, THEY WON ROUND ONE. THEY WERE STEADILY BUYING THE DIP WHEN INVESTORS THE WRIST AND THEY ENDED UP -- DE - RISKED AND THEY ENDED UP RIGHT. IT IS SOMETIMES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE A LONG-TERM HORIZON. THE RETAIL INVESTOR WHO HAS BEEN BUYING SINCE APRIL 2 IS STILL HAPPY AND YOU HAVE MARKETS NEAR ALL-TIME HIGHS AND THAT IS CERTAINLY FOR THEM NOT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT. VONNIE: THANK YOU SO MUCH AND MUST APPRECIATED. COMING UP, PRESIDENT TRUMP REITERATES HIS PLAN PROPOSAL FOR TRADING PARTNERS IN THE U.S.. MORE ON THAT NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a VONNIE: THIS IS BLOOMBERG BRIEF AND YOU ARE LOOKING LIVE AT THE PRINCIPAL ROOM. COMING UP AN INTERVIEW WITH THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC ADVISOR AT PIMCO AT 7:30 A.M. EASTERN AND 12:30 P.M. LONDON TIME. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. > > WE ARE GOING TO BE SENDING LETTERS OUT IN ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF AND TWO WEEKS TO COUNTRY IS TELLING THEM WHAT THE DEAL IS, LIKE I DID WITH THE E.U., --. VONNIE: PRESENT TRUMP REITERATING HIS PLAN AHEAD OF THE DEADLINE AS IT LOOMS. JOINING US IS BRENDAN MURRAY. DO THESE PARADING -- TRADING PARTNERS HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT AND WILL IT BE A DIFFERENT OFFER FOR EACH ONE? BRENDAN: THEY KNOW WHAT THE RATE WILL BE IF THEY DO NOT STRIKE ONE OF THESE DEALS BY JULY 9, AND SOME OF THEM ARE VERY HIGH. VIETNAM ' S IS 46%. JAPAN AND KOREA ARE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 45%. THOSE WOULD BE ECONOMICALLY PAINFUL FOR THOSE ECONOMIES, PARTICULARLY THE JAPANESE AND KOREAN AUTO INDUSTRY IS. VIETNAM BASED ON OUR REPORTING IS IN THE FAST LANE FOR A DEAL. IT IS MAKING NOISES THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LIKES TO HEAR ABOUT BUYING MORE U.S. EXPORTS. INDIA IS ALSO AMONG THE COUNTRIES MOVING QUICKLY. SO, WE HAVE THREE OR FOUR WEEKS NOW BEFORE THE DEALS NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT SAYING ON ONE HAND IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ONE WITH US THEN YOU WILL GET THE HIGHER RECIPROCAL TARIFF RATE. AND THEN YOU HAVE TREASURY SECRETARY BESSENT SAYING AND SOFTENING THE TONE AND SAYING IF YOU ARE NEGOTIATING IN GOOD FAITH, WE WILL PUSH THAT DEADLINE OUT AND KEEP TALKING. THAT IS PROBABLY BY DESIGN, TO ENCOURAGE COUNTRIES THAT THINK THEY CAN DELAY AND INSTALL AND WAIT THIS OUT TO COME TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE QUICKLY. VONNIE: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. WE APPRECIATE IT. IN THE MIDDLE EAST, GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS ARE RISING, CAUSING OIL TO FALL AFTER A 4% JUMP YESTERDAY. IRAN THREATENED TO STRIKE U.S. BASES IF TALKS OVER ITS NUCLEAR TOQUE -- PROGRAM FALL THROUGH. JOINING US IS WILL KENNEDY AND WE ARE GETTING MORE HEADLINES FROM THE SEMI OFFICIAL AGENCY THAT IRAN ORDERED THE PRODUCTION OF A NEW RHENIUM -- URANIUM RICHMOND -- ENRICHMENT FACILITY. DOESN ' T UP THE TENSION? WILL: THE TRADERS IN THE OIL MARKET ARE TRACKING A FEW DIFFERENT RISKS. NUMBER ONE THERE IS THIS THREAT OF MILITARY ACTION AND TALK THAT ISRAEL MIGHT BE WILLING TO STRIKE IRAN AND THAT IS THE WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR ANY OIL TRADERS IF IT ESCALATED AND STOPPED OIL FROM FLOWING FROM THE PERSIAN GULF WHICH IS KEYED TO THE MARKET. IN THE BACKGROUND YOU HAVE ATOMIC DISCLOSE -- ATOMIC DIPLOMACY AND THE TALKS ON A NUCLEAR DEAL. AND THERE IT GETS VERY BAD. TODAY YOU HAVE THE YUAN ATOMIC AGENCY SAYING THAT IRAN IS IN BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS ON URANIUM ENRICHMENT AND INTERN THEY ARE SAYING AND POINTING OUT THAT IT MIGHT UP ITS URANIUM ENRICHMENT AND AGAINST THIS IS THAT SANCTIONS WILL SNAP BACK OR THE U.S. OR THE U.N. WILL SNAP BACK IF HE IS SANCTIONS WHICH WILL RESTRICT THE FLOW OF OIL WHICH IS WHY WE ARE SEEING PRICES RISE BY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT. ONE THING I WILL POINT OUT IS THAT PRICES TOUCHED $70 A BARREL WHICH IS NOT A LEVEL FOR THE KEY BENCHMARK THAT WE HAVE SEEN SINCE APRIL 1 OPEC PUT A LOT OF OIL BACK IN THE MARKET AND THAT SHOWS YOU HOW RESILIENT THE OIL MARKET HAS BEEN TO THIS EXTRA SUPPLY, AND THE CONCERNS THAT WE MIGHT BE LOSING OIL FROM IRAN IN THE COMING MONTHS. VONNIE: IT WAS QUITE THE EYE-POPPING MOVE AND WE WILL KEEP OUR EYE ON THE MARKETS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING. ALL EYES ARE ALSO ON THE 30 YEAR TREASURY AUCTION SCHEDULED FOR 1:00 P.M. NEW YORK TIME. INVESTORS ARE LOOKING AT A FRESH READ ON SPIRALING VESTMENT -- SPIRALING DIFFERENCES ARE CAUSING ALARM. > > THERE IS AN AWARENESS NOW THAT THE LONG-TERM TREASURY BOND IS NOT A LEGITIMATE QUALITY ASSET. IT IS NOT RESPONDING TO LOWER INTEREST RATES AND NOT REALLY RESPONDING TO AN INFLATION RATE WHICH IS NOW 2.5% AND WILL PROBABLY GO HIGHER ON THE INFLATION RATE. VONNIE: FOR MORE, OUR EUROPEAN FX AND RATES COVERAGE LEADER JOINS US. BOND WILL OPTIONS HAVE BECOME MUCH WATCHED EVENTS. WHAT IS THE FEELING GOING INTO THIS ONE HAVE BEEN THAT IT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN THE 30 YEAR MIGHT BE A LITTLE RICHARD TODAY? > > THE AUCTIONS HAVE BEEN IN FOCUS AND THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS AN OFFERING OF 30 YEAR BONDS. LAST MONTH WE HAD A HUGE SELLOFF AND THOSE THIRTY-YEAR ONES WERE THE HEART OF IT, NOT ONLY IN THE U.S. BUT ALSO IN JAPAN. WHAT IS BEHIND THE ANXIETY IS FISCAL CONCERNS. THEY ARE WORRIED THAT GOVERNMENTS WILL HAVE TO ISSUE MORE DEBT TO FUND THEIR SPENDING AND THAT IS MAKING THE MARKET JITTERY. YESTERDAY ' S AUCTION WENT FINE, SO TODAY WE ARE LOOKING FOR ANY SIGNS OF WHETHER INVESTORS WILL BUY INTO IT OR IF THERE IS SOME CODE -- COLD FEET. VONNIE: THAT IS AT 1:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH. BACK TO BREAKING NEWS, AND AIR INDIA BOEING 787 AIRCRAFT CARRYING 242 PASSENGERS AND CREW HAS CRASHED. IT WAS TREVOR -- IT WAS TRAVELING TO LONDON. FOR MORE WE ARE JOINED BY SID PHILLIPS. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE CRASH? SID: I SAW THE AIRLINE CONFIRM THAT 242 PASSENGERS AND CREW ON BOARD THE AIRCRAFT AND THEY HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THEY HAVE NOT YET SAID HOW MANY HAVE SURVIVED OR WHAT THE CASUALTY NUMBERS ARE. BUT WE DID SEE IMAGES OF A FAIRLY FIERY EXPLOSION. AND WE DO KNOW THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS A BOEING 787. THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST-EVER FATAL CRASH FOR THIS AIRCRAFT. THIS HAS BEEN IN SERVICE FOR OVER A DECADE NOW AND IT IS USED BY MULTIPLE AIRLINES AND IT IS THE MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED AIRCRAFT CURRENTLY IN SERVICE. THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST FATAL CRASH FOR THIS MODEL. WE ARE STILL WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE AIRLINE OR AUTHORITIES TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHAT THE REASON FOR THE CRASH WAS. WE WILL KNOW MORE ABOUT IT AS THE DAYS AND MONTHS GO BY. AT THE MOMENT, DO NOT HAVE A CAUSE FOR WHAT HAPPENED. WE KNOW THAT THE AIRCRAFT CLIMBED 625 FEET. SO SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF THIS OCCURRED. WE ARE WAITING ON MORE DETAILS FOR WHAT WENT DOWN. VONNIE: THIS IS IN THE GUJARAT REGION AND AIR INDIA WOULD BE THE FLIGHT CARRIER AIRLINE? SID: AIR INDIA IS THE FLIGHT CARRIER AIRLINE AND THE OPERATE INTERNATIONAL SERVICES TO THE U.S., U.K. AND OTHER DESTINATIONS. THEY ARE IN THE MIDST OF A TURNAROUND UNDER A NEW GROUP THAT ACQUIRED THEM FROM THE GOVERNMENT. AND THEY HAVE PLACED LARGE ORDERS FOR A HUNDRED PLUS AIRCRAFT AND THEY ARE REVITALIZING THE FLEET AND SERVICES, ADDING MORE DESTINATIONS. THIS IS A MASSIVE BLOW TO THE CARRIER WHO HAD AMBITIONS TO SCALE UP AND TARGET MORE PASSENGERS AND BRING IN MORE PASSENGERS TO THE HUBS. AND THIS WOULD BE A MASSIVE BLOW TO AIR INDIA ' S PLANS AS WELL AS TO THE SAFETY RECORD. AT THE SAME TIME, WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG AND WHY THIS OCCURRED. AND WE ARE WAITING FOR MORE FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND AUTHORITY IS IN TERMS OF WHAT THE DETAILS OF THIS INCIDENT ARE. VONNIE: THANK YOU AND WE ARE GETTING ANOTHER HEADLINE THAT IT HAD 169 INDIAN AND 53 BRITISH NATIONALS ON BOARD. THAT IS SID IN LONDON. A CHECK ON THE MARKETS AS WE HAD CLOSER TO THE OPENING BELL. WE ARE DOWN ALMOST .5% FOR S & P FUTURES AFTER A DOWN DAY YESTERDAY. THE DOLLAR INDEX IS DOWN ANOTHER .5% AND THAT IS THE THEME. THE DOLLAR IS SELLING CONSTANTLY. THE 10-YEAR YIELD AT 4.3828 AFTER THE SUCCESSFUL AUCTION. WE WILL BE WATCHING THE THIRTY-YEAR AUCTION AT 1:00 P.M. EASTERN. THAT IS IT FOR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. SURVEILLANCE IS RIGHT AHEAD. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a",
