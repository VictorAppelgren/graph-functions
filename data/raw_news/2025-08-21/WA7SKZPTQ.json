  "content": "The Venice Film Festival offers an embarrassment of auteur riches this year. The 82nd edition, which kicks off on Wednesday, has films from Guillermo del Toro, Kathryn Bigelow, Park Chan-wook, Yorgos Lanthimos, Sofia Coppola, Jim Jarmusch, Gus Van Sant and Luca Guadagnino, to name a few. Even Charlie Kaufman has a short film (\u201cHow to Shoot a Ghost\u201d).\n\nDepending on how they play, some in the lineup will surely be part of the Oscar conversation in the new year, as several filmmakers this year can attest from experience. In 2017, del Toro launched \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d at Venice, where its Golden Lion win was the first of many that awards season, culminating with a best picture and best director prize at the Academy Awards. In 2023, Lanthimos also had a charmed Venice debut for \u201cPoor Things,\u201d another Golden Lion winner that would get Emma Stone a best actress Oscar.\n\nHere\u2019s a preview of 12 films to get excited about this year.\n\nIt\u2019s always an event when Lanthimos teams up with Stone. Described as a science-fiction black comedy and a remake of a South Korean film, \u201cBugonia\u201d stars Jesse Plemons as a conspiracy-obsessed man who (along with Aidan Delbis) kidnaps Stone\u2019s character, the CEO of a pharmaceutical group, because they believe she\u2019s an alien. Focus Features plans a late October theatrical release.\n\nNoah Baumbach takes on his own industry, and the idea that coming-of-age stories are only for the young, in \u201cJay Kelly,\u201d casting George Clooney as a movie star on an introspective (and comedic) journey through Europe with his manager Ron (Adam Sandler). Baumbach cowrote the script with Emily Mortimer, who is part of the large ensemble cast including Laura Dern, Billy Crudup and Greta Gerwig. In theaters in November and on Netflix in December.\n\nAnother Coppola-related documentary, but this one, directed by Mike Figgis, is about the making of Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cMegalopolis,\u201d his decades-in-the-making, self-financed epic. The film takes viewers behind the scenes of the creative process, from the rehearsal space to the set where you can be sure that Shia LaBeouf is going to speak his mind. In theaters this fall.\n\nJulia Roberts plays a beloved and glamorous college professor whose mentee ( Ayo Edebiri ) accuses her close friend and colleague (Andrew Garfield) of \u201ccrossing the line\u201d in this psychosexual drama from Luca Guadagnino. The stacked cast also includes Guadagnino regulars Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Michael Stuhlbarg. Amazon MGM Studios will release it in theaters in October.\n\nKorean filmmaker Park Chan-wook\u2019s highly anticipated follow-up to \u201cDecision to Leave\u201d has been a long time coming. He first mentioned work on an adaptation of Donald Westlake\u2019s novel \u201cThe Ax\u201d in 2009. The story is about a middle-aged manager at a paper company who grows increasingly, and violently, desperate after being laid off. Lee Byung-hun and Son Yejin star. Neon has not set a release date.\n\nVisionary filmmaker Guillermo del Toro\u2019s decades-long dream of adapting Mary Shelley\u2019s classic novel, which he has said is his absolute favorite book, has come true. A master of the gothic milieu, his \u201cFrankenstein\u201d stars Oscar Isaac as Dr. Viktor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as the monster. It\u2019s one of the most anticipated films of the year. Mia Goth, Christoph Waltz and Charles Dance also star. \u201cFrankenstein\u201d is in theaters in October and streaming on Netflix in November.\n\nJim Jarmusch directs Tom Waits, Adam Driver, Mayim Bialik, Charlotte Rampling, Cate Blanchett and Vicky Krieps in a triptych anthology film about relationships between adult children. Jarmusch said in a statement that it\u2019s an \u201canti-action film, its subtle and quiet style carefully constructed to allow small details to accumulate.\u201d The filmmaker, a Cannes darling, was last on the Lido out of competition with \u201cCoffee and Cigarettes\u201d over 20 years ago. MUBI will release the film in theaters this fall.\n\nIs Dwayne Johnson destined for an Oscar nomination? His transformation into MMA and UFC fighter Mark Kerr, a champion and addict, might just be the ticket, with filmmaker Benny Safdie (who codirected \u201cUncut Gems\u201d) at the helm and Emily Blunt playing his wife. A24 will release it in theaters in October.\n\nAmanda Seyfried plays the founding leader of the Shakers, the 18th century religious sect, in a musical drama from filmmaker Mona Fastvold, who cowrote \u201cThe Testament of Ann Lee\u201d with her partner Brady Corbert. Like \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which Fastvold shared writing duties on, it was also shot on 70 mm film, but runs a slimmer 130 minutes. The cast includes Thomasin McKenzie, Lewis Pullman, Stacy Martin, Tim Blake Nelson and Christopher Abbott.\n\nNot too much is known about Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s political thriller, set inside the White House around an impending missile strike on the U.S. and starring Idris Elba and Rebecca Ferguson. It\u2019s the Oscar winner\u2019s first film since \u201cDetroit\u201d came out in 2017, and written by former NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, whose script for \u201cJackie\u201d won the best screenplay prize at Venice in 2016. Netflix plans an October release for both streaming and theatrical.\n\nSofia Coppola follows in her late mother\u2019s footsteps by directing a documentary (her first), about fashion designer Marc Jacobs. Their friendship goes back to the early 1990s in New York. It\u2019s a relationship that goes beyond muse territory and has spawned numerous collaborations. She even wore one of his dresses when she won her first Oscar. For fashion and film fans, it\u2019s a must-see. A24 has not set a release date.\n\nSet entirely inside the Red Crescent Society call center, Tunisian filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania tells the story of the efforts to rescue the young girl Hind Rajab from her family\u2019s shot-out car in Gaza City last January, using the real audio of her voice.\n\nFestival head Alberto Barbera predicted that it \u201cwill be one of the films that will get the most intense response from everybody \u2026 not only political reasons but for emotional, human reasons.\u201d The film is seeking distribution.\n\nFor more coverage of the 2025 Venice Film Festival, visit https://apnews.com/hub/venice-film-festival.",
