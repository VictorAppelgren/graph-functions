  "content": "Aug. 23 (UPI) -- The Trump administration is undertaking a 50-day investigation into the furniture market, with pending tariffs likely to revive the nation's industry.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced the investigation in a Truth Social post on Friday and said he will impose undetermined tariffs afterward.\n\n\"This will bring the furniture business back to NorthCarolina, South Carolina, Michigan and states across the Union,\" Trump said.\n\nNorth Carolina ia known as the Furniture Capital of the World, which developed from access to hardwood in Appalachian forests. U.S. companies include Ashley Furniture, Century, Vanguard and Lexington Home Brands.\n\nThe pending tariffs are in keeping with those the president has imposed on other industries with the aim of returning manufacturing to the United States and reducing reliance on foreign-made goods.\n\nThe investigation is directed at furniture from \"other Countries\" but primarily impacts key suppliers such as China and Vietnam, which together supply about 60% of U.S. furniture imports.\n\nMost foreign goods are already subject to tariffs from trading partners, including a baseline 10%. In a deal with Vietnam, the rate is 20% with 40% on goods going through Vietnam from a third country. In China, the rate is 10% under a 90-day pause until November from 30% after a threatened peak of 125%.\n\nTrump's social media post prompted a drop in shares during after-hours trading for many of the nation's leading furniture retailers, including Wayfair, Williams-Sonoma and RH, CNBC reported.\n\nWayfair shares ended after-hours trading at $74.03, which was down 3.81% from its closing price of $77.84 at the end of day trading on Friday.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma dropped $6.37 and 3.13% to $197.05 during after-hours trading, while RH fell $13.51 and 5.54% to $230.20.\n\nU.S.-based La-Z Boy, though, saw its share price rise by 76 cents and 2.08% to $37.34 after closing at $36.58 at the close of day trading on Friday.\n\nThe furniture tariffs announcement comes as the nation's furniture industry is experiencing difficulties.\n\nDemand for new furniture and home goods has declined as home sales slowed over the past year.\n\nSlower home sales lessen the demand for new furniture and furnishings, and years of relatively high inflation have made consumers wary of how they spend their money, according to CNBC.",

      "text": "Aug. 13 (UPI) -- The GE Appliances company announced Wednesday that it plans to invest billions of dollars into its American operations and create more than 1,000 jobs.\n\"We are defining the future of manufacturing at GE Appliances by investing in our plants, people, and communities,\" said GE Appliances President and CEO Kevin Nolan in a press release.\n\"No other appliance company over the last decade has invested more in U.S. manufacturing than we have,\" Nolan claimed. \"Our $3 billion, five-year plan shows that our commitment to U.S. manufacturing will continue into the future.\"\nThe company said in the release that the first round of investments will take place at plants located in five different Southern states.\nRelated\nAccording to the announcement, its top-freezer refrigerator plant in Decatur, Ala., will add new models and ramp up production before August ends, while its LaFayette, Ga., plant will begin to produce gas ranges in addition to its usual electric item production.\nThe gas ranges were previously produced in Mexico.\nGE Appliances will also double the output of its gas water heater plant in Camden, S.C., with the addition of new types of water heaters to be manufactured there, and in December, its Selmer, Tenn. facility will add two new models to its manufacturing lineup.\nAdditionally, the company's global headquarters and plant in Louisville, Ky. will receive an investment of $490 million and create 800 new jobs as it begins production of combination washer/ dryers and front-load washers.\n\"Thanks [GE Appliances], for being a vital part of our city's past and future,\" Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg posted to X Wednesday.\nDuring a livestreamed meeting at the company's Louisville, Kentucky headquarters on Wednesday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said that \"As one of the most prominent employers and manufacturing leaders, GE Appliances has helped establish Kentucky as America's destination for advanced manufacturing and job creation.\"\n\"GE Appliances is Kentucky,\" he added. \"And today, this long-standing team Kentucky partner is building on its commitment to our commonwealth with the largest economic sector investment in the past five years.\""

      "text": "The Trump administration has launched an investigation into imported furniture, President Donald Trump said Friday, setting the stage for new tariffs on a wide range of products.\n\"Within the next 50 days, that Investigation will be completed, and Furniture coming from other Countries into the United States will be Tariffed at a Rate yet to be determined,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. \"This will bring the Furniture Business back to North Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan, and States all across the Union.\"\nFollowing Trump's post, shares of top furniture and home goods companies, including Wayfair, RH and Williams-Sonoma, tumbled in after-hours trading.\nWayfair imports much of its furniture. RH, formerly Restoration Hardware and Williams-Sonoma have been working to diversify their supply chains.\nNew tariffs could drive up costs for many of these major furniture brands. But not for all of them.\nShares of La-Z-Boy, which has most of its manufacturing in the U.S., rose on the news of Trump's tariff plans.\nTrump has already put steep tariffs on cars, steel and aluminum and he has floated similar customs duties for imported copper, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.\nIt was unclear Friday whether new, sectoral tariffs on furniture would be applied on top of country specific tariff rates.\nThe Trump administration has spent months holding bilateral negotiations with U.S. trade partners in an effort to reset the balance of global trade. Recent framework agreements with the European Union and China have helped to calm markets, but leave many longer-term issues unresolved.\nAny new tariffs would come at a difficult moment for the U.S. furniture industry, which faces a range of challenges.\nCompanies like Wayfair have seen demand fall for more than a year on items like new couches and dining sets, a drop caused in part by a slower overall housing market as buyers wait for interest rates to come down.\nWith fewer new homes being bought, consumers have fewer reasons to buy new furniture.\nPlus, with stubborn inflation, they have been more choosy on where they are spending their discretionary income. Restaurants, new clothes, trips and home decor have all taken a hit.\n\u2014 CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge contributed to this report."
