      "text": "I get a kick out of Strands, one of The New York Times' online games. It's a fun daily brain-buster where you have to find words in a letter grid -- but you don't have a list, you just have to find the words all on your own. Sometimes I see the theme and begin recognizing the answers right away, but other times, I really need to make smaller words so the puzzle gives me hints to the theme words.\nAnd if you need tips and answers for Strands, Connections, Wordle, the NYT Mini Crossword and Connections: Sports Edition, CNET has the answers every day. (Bookmark this page for an easy hint or two when you need them.)\nRead more: Here's Our Answer Page For Strands, Connections, Wordle and More\nHow to play NYT Strands\nI first started playing Strands in May, when it was still in beta, but it officially launched in late June, so you can find it on The New York Times' Games site and app.\nThere's a theme\nOnce you're there, you'll see a very brief phrase that's labeled as \"Today's Theme\" for the puzzle. You're looking for words hidden in the word-search grid that all relate to that theme.\nIt's a word find, with a twist\nIf you see a word, click on the first letter and drag your mouse to each of the following letters, in order. You can move in any direction, just so long as the letters are directly next to each other and you move from one to the next in their proper order. Or you can just click on each letter in the order they're in the word. You have to click the last letter twice so the game knows you're done -- I forget this all the time. Each word must be four letters or more.\nYour goal: Find the theme words\nIf you find a theme word, it'll light up in blue. You can also find words that aren't related to the theme and the game will give you one credit toward a hint. Find three such words and click the Hint button, and the puzzle shows you the letters for one of the theme words. It won't show them in order though -- you still have to unscramble them. There's generally six or seven theme words, but the number seems to vary, I guess because different lengths of words are used each day to fit the theme and fill in the entire letter grid.\nSpangram explains the theme\nThere's a special theme word called a \"spangram\" hidden in the puzzle. It spans the entire puzzle, though it could be across, or top to bottom, and it describes the puzzle's theme. Get that word, and it will light up yellow.\nRead more: Wordle Cheat Sheet Ranks Most Popular Letters Used in English Words\nUse these tips to win\nI'm always amazed that Strands manages to use every single letter in the puzzle, plus provide enough small words for me to get all the hints I need. Here are the tips I've picked up from playing the game.\nTip No. 1: Use the theme\nThe themes of the puzzles are pretty general, and sometimes jokey, but don't ignore them. They're a free clue to the spangram, and if you find that first, you'll find the theme words easily. So if the theme was something like \"Relish the thought,\" the puzzle-makers might be using \"relish\" to mean the food, and the spangram could be \"condiments.\"\nTip No. 2: Shoot for the spangram\nIt's easy to find short words in the puzzle, but swing for the fences and look for the spangram first. It touches two opposite sides of the board, and sometimes it's a two-word phrase. Take your time and stare at the puzzle for a while, or even come back to it after a break from your screen. That might help you find answers.\nTip No. 3: Use your hints well\nYou can treat Strands like any word-search puzzle and just look for hidden words that match the theme. But if you're like me, you're going to want to get hints. As long as the word is four letters or more, it counts. You can also reuse a hint word if you can add an ending to it, like an S (in other words, if there's an S touching the last letter, or a longer ending, like ES, that moves out from the last letter).\nTip No. 4: Hints are valuable\nIf you find three non-theme words, you can click on the Hint button and the letters for one of the theme words will light up on the board. Yet sometimes I still struggle to unscramble the letters. You could use an online anagram solver to see what words can be made from those letters. But there's another way: Once you have an active hint on the board, meaning the letters are lit up, just not in order, find enough words to earn another hint. Because you've already got that active hint on the board, your new hint will reveal the actual word by highlighting each letter in order.\nRead more: Here's Today's Wordle Answer and Connections Answer"

      "text": "Connections, one of many addictive online puzzles from The New York Times online, turned a year old on Wednesday with a special cinematic puzzle. Spoilers ahead, but all four categories shared a movie theme, though the specific topic was different for each group of four. One group featured movie titles with rhyming words, like Kill Bill. Honestly, I never thought \"E\" and \"T\" rhymed, but yep, they do. Phone home, indeed.\nConnections launched on June 12, 2023, joining other popular games, such as Wordle, which celebrated its 1,000th puzzle in March with a fairly easy answer.\nConnections is a very different game from Wordle. In Wordle, you have six chances to guess a five-letter word. In Connections, you're given 16 words and need to sort them into four categories. The big problem is that many of the words fit into multiple categories -- and some of the categories themselves are really loopy. (\"Car companies minus letter\" was one, turning DODGE into DOGE and HONDA into HODA.)\nWe have Wednesday's Connections answers here, plus the answers for Wednesday's Wordle, as well as the answers for the newer Strands game.\nThe Times released some Connections birthday statistics in honor of the milestone. In the past year, 55.2 million people finished a Connections puzzle without any mistakes. The most common time to play Connections is 9 a.m. And the top cities that completed the most Connections puzzles are a global group. Here are the top 10:\n- New York\n- Chicago\n- Sydney\n- Melbourne\n- Brooklyn\n- Seattle\n- Los Angeles\n- Toronto\n- Philadelphia\n- Minneapolis\nBut my favorite Connections stat released on the game's birthday was shared on Instagram, where the newspaper posted the five most difficult puzzles.\nThose five include some gems, like the Aug. 16, 2023, puzzle, where \"bacon\" and \"egg\" are split up, with neither of them going in the category called \"breakfast foods.\"\nThe toughest puzzle of Connections' first year, however, came on Oct. 12, 2023. That's where \"crown\" and \"tiara\" ended up in different categories. Crown showed up in \"parts of a watch,\" while tiara represented Wonder Woman's costume. Only 19.63% of players solved that day's puzzle.\nOne Connections player commented on Instagram, \"I'm new to this game, do they often have words that could fit into multiple categories?\"\nOh yes, sweet summer child, oh yes, indeed."
