  "title": "After Donations, Trump Sided With Health Firms on Medicare Funds for Pricey Wound Care",
  "description": "The president posted talking points provided by one firm that donated millions, and his administration delayed a change that could have hurt the company and others like it.",
  "content": "Oliver Burckhardt came prepared for the dinner that President Trump hosted for a small group of major donors at his private Mar-a-Lago resort in South Florida on March 1.\n\nA week earlier, one of Mr. Burkhardt\u2019s biotech companies had donated $5 million to MAGA Inc., a pro-Trump political committee, that paved the way for him to attend the event.\n\nAt the dinner, Mr. Burckhardt got a chance to speak briefly to the president and other guests about himself and the work of his company, Extremity Care, which makes pricey medical products including paper-thin bandages made of dried bits of placenta, according to three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private event. He also brought copies of a flier urging the Trump administration to reverse a plan to restrict Medicare reimbursement for the bandages and criticizing former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for having \u201crammed through a policy that would create more suffering and death for diabetic patients on Medicare.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, Mr. Trump posted the flier on his social media site.\n\nIt was not just symbolic.\n\nAbout one month later, the Trump administration announced it would delay until next year the Biden administration plan to limit Medicare\u2019s coverage of the bandages, known as skin substitutes, saying that it was reviewing its policies.",
