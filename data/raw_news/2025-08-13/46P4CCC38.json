During our common time, Sita supported as a Project Sponsor on my challenging and complex Google Cloud MSP (Managed Services Partner) Assessment project that I was managing as a Project Manager. I always perceived and recognized Sita as a skilled leader and professional who I could rely on and ask for advice when I or my team hit a difficult situation in the project. We always comprehensively reviewed a critical issue and looked at it from different angles to lock the best possible outcome and success for the business, client and business partner. I was always impressed by her business acumens and ability to drive the team of dozens to achieve their best potential. She brings to any organization, department and team a wealth of experience from the P&L and lifecycle management of various DXC Platform Services offerings covering Google Cloud Managed Services, PaaS for SAP on private and public cloud, Managed Container PaaS, SIAM, Integration Solutions, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery, Oracle Cloud Managed Services and Alibaba Cloud Managed Services. Her position includes all portfolio, financial and GTM activities including but not limited to product and lifecycle management, sales and revenue achievement, financial cost management, partner management, marketing and sales enablement and more. I was also inspired by her ability to delegate tasks and to ask the right questions until there are all answers on the table in order to make the best informative decision. Asking the right questions the right people is often half of solution to any problem. She is a true inspirational lead in the IT industry. Any company, its people, customers and business partners that hires her in the future will only gain, grow and lead the market. I enjoyed being part of the same team as Sita and having an opportunity to learn from her knowledge, experience, way of approaching tasks or problems. I wish her all the best in her professional career path. \u201d\nAbout\nActivity\n-\n\u2600\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde9\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\uddec\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde7 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udddb\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\uddda\ud835\udddf\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd9\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddda\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud835\udfed\ud835\udff1 \ud835\uddea\ud835\udddb\ud835\uddec \ud835\udddc\ud835\udde7\u2019\ud835\udde6 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udddb\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde0\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7-\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde7\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\u2026\n\u2600\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde9\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\uddec\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde7 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udddb\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\uddda\ud835\udddf\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd9\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddda\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud835\udfed\ud835\udff1 \ud835\uddea\ud835\udddb\ud835\uddec \ud835\udddc\ud835\udde7\u2019\ud835\udde6 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udddb\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde0\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7-\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde7\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\u2026\nLiked by Sita Lowman\n-\nThis week, we held our annual NACD Pacific Southwest Chapter Board Retreat!

This was one of the earliest leading industry examples of leveraging large data for creating significant business value. The method and the application gives a huge competitive advantage and $$ to the bottom line. The methodology uses huge data - right from the time a Power Plant gets ordered by the customer, that is, from its concept-to-design board-to-engineering-to-manufacturing-to- installation, and then numerous upgrades throughout its in-service lifecycle over the next 30-40 years, this methodology superimposes the the real time operational data (running into terabytes) coming from hundreds of live sensors (BIG DATA analytics called now, Data Mining was the name then), and help utility customers chose an optimal path by using statistical, operational, and business rule engines in a seamless way. This patent work was initiated in 1999 and became the driver for several new business units within the GE Energy creating huge $$ value.\nLanguages\n-\nHindi\nFull professional proficiency\n-\nPunjabi\nLimited working proficiency\n-\nRajasthani\nLimited working proficiency\nMore activity by Suresh\n-\nToday, we commemorate the legacy of Apollo 13 astronaut James Lovell, the valiant commander of the renowned 1970 mission.
