  "content": "Meta announced the rollout this week, introducing a map that lets U.S. users share their locations and see location-based content from friends\u2014similar to Snapchat\u2019s Snap Map or Apple\u2019s Find My.

      "text": "Today, we\u2019re launching several new ways to help you better connect with your friends on Instagram. People have always come to Instagram to share what they\u2019re up to and where they are. Now, with reposts, the map, and the \u201cFriends\u201d tab in Reels, it\u2019s easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you\u2019re enjoying on Instagram.\nRepost Your Favorite Reels and Posts\nWith reposts, you can repost public reels and feed posts, making it easier for you to share your interests with your friends. Reposts will be recommended to your friends\u2019 and followers\u2019 feeds, and they\u2019ll also be in a separate tab on your profile, so you can always go back to revisit your reposts.\nReposts are credited to the original poster. If you\u2019re a creator, this means that if your content is reposted by someone else, it may be recommended to that person\u2019s followers, even if those people don\u2019t follow you. This gives creators an opportunity to reach even more people.\nTo repost a reel or post, tap the repost icon. You can also add a note to your repost by typing into the thought bubble that appears on screen and pressing save.\nConnect with Friends Using the Instagram Map\nStay up-to-date with friends with the Instagram map. You can opt in to sharing your last active location with friends you choose, and you can turn it off anytime. You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from interesting or fun locations. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\nLocation sharing is off unless you opt in. If you do share your location with friends, you have controls to customize this experience:\n- You choose who you share your location with: friends (followers you follow back), Close Friends, Only selected friends, or no one.\n- You can choose to not share location in specific places or with specific people.\n- If you use location sharing, your location is updated whenever you open the app or return to the app if it\u2019s been running in the background. You can turn off location sharing at any time.\n- If you\u2019re a parent with supervision set up for your teen, you have control over their location sharing experience on the map. You will receive a notification if your teen starts sharing their location, giving you the opportunity to have important conversations about how to safely share with friends. You can decide whether your teen has access to location sharing on the map and see who your teen is sharing their location with.\n- Learn more about sharing location.\nRegardless of whether you choose to share your location, you can use the map to explore location-based content. From checking out stories from friends who\u2019ve gone to a concert or finding a new place to hang out from a local creator\u2019s reel, there\u2019s content to help you and your friends connect with the world around you.\nAny content with a location tagged can show up on the map including:\n- Reels, posts, and stories from people you follow, available for 24 hours after it\u2019s posted\n- Notes from people you mutually follow, available for 24 hours\nYou can find the Instagram map at the top of your DM inbox. This feature is rolling out to the US today, with more global availability soon.\nFind Out What Your Friends Are Enjoying\nWe\u2019re introducing Friends, a new tab in Reels where you can see public content your friends have interacted with, or recommendations from Blends you\u2019ve started, and easily start conversations about them. Friends will help you see which reels the people you care about most are creating and engaging with. We started rolling Friends out earlier this year, and are now excited to launch it globally.\nTo access your Friends tab, tap the \u201cFriends\u201d tab at the top of Reels. To return to your usual Reels feed, tap the \u201cReels\u201d tab. We\u2019re also rolling out controls for what\u2019s shown in the Friends tab, including the ability to hide your own likes and comments on reels, and to mute activity bubbles from specific people you follow."
