  "title": "Tech is getting a boost from AI ad tools. Some companies are being left behind",
  "description": "Ad revenue has stayed strong amid broader macroeconomic uncertainty due to President Donald Trump's tough tariffs and the closing of the de minimis loophole.",
  "content": "Artificial intelligence has been a shot in the arm for digital advertising. Meta and Alphabet both reported sales and earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations, but the strength in digital ad spend was notable. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the earnings call that AI helped imbue \"greater efficiency and gains across our ad system,\" thus contributing to the 22% year-over-year increase of second-quarter sales that hit $47.52 billion. Meta finance chief Susan Li also told analysts during a follow-up earnings call on July 30 that the online ad market appears to have improved since April. In April, Li noted that Asia-based online retailers pulled back on their digital ad spending amid broader macroeconomic uncertainty due to President Donald Trump's tough tariffs and the closing of the de minimis trade loophole. This quarter, Li said there's been a noticeable \"improvement\" with those Asian-based ecommerce firms, which have increased their digital ad spending on the platform along with small, North American-based advertisers. \"We generally expect another quarter of healthy advertising demand,\" Li said about the advertising pickup.\n\nGil Luria, the head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, said that while there is still broader macroeconomic uncertainty, \"today, digital advertising in general, is doing well; It is simply an extension of the fact that the consumer is still strong.\" \"There's optimism that consumer spending will hold up and therefore all the downstream markets will hold up,\" Luria said. \"I think one of the things that its earnings taught us was that you can spend a lot of money on AI when your core business is doing well, and especially when your core business has been already benefiting from the investments that you've made in AI,\" Jasmine Enberg, a vice president and principal analyst for eMarketer, said about Meta's second quarter. The continued jaw-dropping pace of AI spending also doesn't seem to be slowing any time soon. Alphabet added an extra $10 billion to its 2025 forecast for capital expenditures, now pegged at $85 billion, while Meta raised the low end of its capital expenditures for the year to come in between $66 billion and $72 billion instead of $64 billion and $72 billion. Investors showed no signs of trepidation about Meta and Alphabet's massive AI spend because those companies' overall sales continued to rise.\n\nOutside of the tech giants, Reddit reported strong second-quarter sales of $500 million, representing a 78% year-over-year increase that helped lift the company's shares as much as 20%. \"They kind of rose back like a phoenix and had some extraordinary results,\" Luria said about Reddit, which saw its shares plummet over 15% in February after it reported weaker-than-expected user numbers due to a Google search algorithm change. Reddit's blockbuster quarter contrasted with similar-sized peers like Snap and Pinterest , which both reported lukewarm quarterly earnings this week. Snap's second-quarter sales grew only 9% year-over-year and it missed Wall Street's estimates on global average revenue per user, a metric that refers to how much money the company derives from each user. Contributing to the miss was a botched update to Snap's advertising platform that hurt the company's \"topline growth,\" Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in an investor letter. The Snapchat parent on Wednesday also added Reddit to its list of competitors in its latest 10-Q filing on Wednesday, indicating a potential, burgeoning rivalry.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump indicated Friday ahead of key trade talks that he was willing to lower tariffs on China to 80%, but that level may still be higher than what investors and business leaders were hoping for.\nTrump said in a Truth Social post: \"80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B.\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is one of the U.S. officials set to speak with counterparts from China at meetings in Switzerland this weekend.\nAn 80% levy would be a significant reduction from the 145% tariff currently facing many Chinese goods. However, that number could still be seen as prohibitive to trade. It is also much higher than the 10% baseline tariff in the U.S.-U.K. trade agreement that was announced Thursday.\nIt is unclear whether Trump wants the 80% rate to be the long-term tariff for China, or whether it should be viewed as a step in negotiations.\nIn a separate post, Trump said \"Many Trade Deals in the hopper, all good (GREAT!) ones!\"\nChina is seen as the key hurdle in Trump's effort to shake up the global trading environment. While many other major countries saw his previously announced tariffs partially paused on April 9, tensions rose between the White House and Beijing until both countries had imposed a tariff of more than 100% on goods.\nChina is one of the U.S.' largest trading partners. In 2024, the U.S. exported $143.5 billion in goods to China, while importing $438.9 billion, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\nIn another Truth Social post on Friday morning, Trump said, \"CHINA SHOULD OPEN UP ITS MARKET TO USA \u2014 WOULD BE SO GOOD FOR THEM!!! CLOSED MARKETS DON'T WORK ANYMORE!!!\"\nThe talks in Switzerland this weekend are not expected to result in a full trade deal. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Thursday on \"Power Lunch\" that he wants the discussions to result in \"stability\" that could be \"a foundation for something more.\"\nThe latest shipping data shows a drastic decline in the amount of goods moving from China to the U.S., leading to concerns about the potential for higher prices or even shortages of certain goods in the coming weeks.\nFriday's comments on China tariff rates appear to signal a shift for Trump. The president said on Wednesday he would not lower tariffs in order to get China to the negotiating table."

      "text": "Tesla's vice president of hardware design engineering, Pete Bannon, is leaving the company after first joining in 2016 from Apple, CNBC has confirmed.\nBannon was leading the development of Tesla's Dojo supercomputer and reported directly to Musk. Bloomberg first reported on Bannon's departure, and added that Musk ordered his team to shut down, with engineers in the group getting reassigned to other initiatives.\nTesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSince early last year, Musk has been trying to convince shareholders that Tesla, his only publicly traded business, is poised to become an an artificial intelligence and robotics powerhouse, and not just an electric vehicle company.\nA centerpiece of the transformation was Dojo, a custom-built supercomputer designed to process and train AI models drawing on the large amounts of video and other data captured by Tesla vehicles.\nTesla's focus on Dojo and another computing cluster called Cortex were meant to improve the company's advanced driver assistance systems, and to enable Musk to finally deliver on his promise to turn existing Teslas into robotaxis.\nOn Tesla's earnings call in July, Musk said the company expected its newest version of Dojo to be \"operating at scale sometime next year, with scale being somewhere around 100,000 H-100 equivalents,\" referring to a supercomputer built using Nvidia's state of the art chips.\nTesla recently struck a $16.5 billion deal with Samsung to produce more of its own A16 chips with the company domestically.\nTesla is running a test Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, and a related car service in San Francisco. In Austin, the company's vehicles require a human safety supervisor in the front passenger seat ready to intervene if necessary. In San Francisco, the car service is operated by human drivers, though invited users can hail a ride through a \"Tesla Robotaxi\" app.\nOn the earnings call, Musk faced questions about how he sees Tesla and his AI company, xAI, keeping their distance given that they could be competing against one another for AI talent.\nMusk said the companies \"are doing different things.\" He said, \"xAI is doing like terabyte scale models and multi-terabyte scale models.\" Tesla uses \"100x smaller models,\" he said, with the automaker focused on \"real-world AI,\" for its cars and robots and xAI focused on developing software that strives for \"artificial super intelligence.\"\nMusk also said that some engineers wouldn't join Tesla because \"they wanted to work on AGI,\" one reason he said he formed a new company.\nTesla has experienced an exodus of top talent this year due to a combination of job terminations and resignations. Milan Kovac, who was Tesla's head of Optimus robotics engineering, departed, as did David Lau, a vice president of software engineering, and Omead Afshar, Musk's former chief of staff.\nWATCH: Tesla's new diner"

That trailed Wall Street estimates of 103.1 million.\nA Google search algorithm change caused some \"volatility\" with user growth in the fourth quarter, but the company's search-related traffic has since recovered in the first quarter, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said in a letter to shareholders.\n\"What happened wasn't unusual \u2014 referrals from search fluctuate from time to time, and they primarily affect logged-out users,\" Huffman wrote. \"Our teams have navigated numerous algorithm updates and did an excellent job adapting to these latest changes effectively.\"\nReddit has benefited from Google search updates and internal site improvements that have helped it gain a significant amount of new and returning users, which the social company refers to as logged-out users, over the past year and a half. Reddit has said it is working to convince logged-out users to create accounts as logged-in users, which are more lucrative for its business.\nGlobal logged-in DAUq grew 27% year over year to 46.1 million in the quarter, while global logged-out DAUq rose 51% to 55.6 million, the company said.\nOn the earnings call, Huffman said that Google's algorithm changes take place about twice a year, adding \"not the first, not the last.\"\n\"It primarily affects logged-out users in the U.S.,\" he said. \"This one was particularly interesting because there really was a swing down, but then a recovery shortly thereafter happened right at the end of the quarter.\"\nDespite missing on user number, the company otherwise reported a strong quarter and provided optimistic guidance.\nReddit's sales jumped 71% in the quarter from $250 million a year earlier, the fastest growth rate for any quarter since 2022.\nThe company said first-quarter sales will be between $360 million and $370 million, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $358 million.\nNet income almost quadrupled to $71 million, or 36 cents a share, from $18.5 million, or breakeven on a per-share basis, a year earlier. Reddit reported adjusted earnings of $154 million in the fourth quarter, topping analysts' expectations of $128 million.\nReddit went public in march at $34 a share and has since seen its stock jump more than sixfold to $216.47 as of Wednesday's close. The shares were up 32% this year prior to the after-hours selloff.\nReddit's fourth-quarter earnings followed several other online advertising tech companies that recently reported their latest quarterly earnings.\nLast week, Amazon reported fourth-quarter earnings, saying its online advertising business recorded $17.29 billion, up 18% from a year ago. In its fourth-quarter earnings, Pinterest said its sales in the period rose 18% year over year to $1.15 billion.\nAlso last week, Alphabet said its Google advertising sales grew 11% from a year prior to $72.46 billion, while YouTube ad revenue jumped 14% to $10.47 billion in the fourth quarter. Snap, meanwhile, reported fourth-quarter revenue growth of 14% year over year to $1.56 billion.\nIn late January, Meta said its revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $48.39 billion, up 21% from the previous year. Microsoft also reported that its news advertising sales increased 21% year over year in its latest quarterly earnings. Microsoft does not disclose that unit's quarterly sales figures.\nWatch: I'd buy Amazon over Meta, says Hightower's Stephanie Link"

Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:\n- Earnings per share: $7.14 vs. $5.92 expected\n- Revenue: $47.52 billion vs. $44.80 billion expected\nMeta's second-quarter sales increased 22% year over year, which was the same growth rate as a year ago.\nThe company's advertising revenue for the second quarter came in at $46.56 billion, ahead of Wall Street projections of $43.97 billion. On a call Wednesday with analysts, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta's artificial intelligence technology unlocked \"greater efficiency and gains across our ad system.\"\nMeta said third-quarter sales will come in a range between $47.5 billion and $50.5 billion, ahead of Wall Street estimates of $46.14 billion.\nThe company said capital expenditures will come in between $66 billion and $72 billion, raising the low end of the company's previous estimate of between $64 billion and $72 billion.\nMeta said that compensation related to hiring will be \"the second-largest driver of growth,\" and that \"these factors will result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.\"\nReality Labs, Meta's unit tasked with developing virtual reality and augmented reality technologies, recorded an operating loss of $4.53 billion on $370 million in sales during the second quarter. The loss was less than Wall Street estimates, but so were the expected sales.\nDaily active people for Meta's family of apps grew to 3.48 billion in the second quarter, ahead of analysts' estimates of 3.45 billion. That's up from 3.43 billion in the previous quarter.\nMeta's total costs and expenses for the second quarter were $27.08 billion, which was a 12% year-over-year increase.\nThe company kicked off its AI hiring bonanza in June when it invested $14.3 billion into Scale AI, landing the data-annotating startup's CEO, Alexandr Wang, to co-lead the new Meta Superintelligence Labs as chief AI officer. Zuckerberg undertook the AI strategy overhaul to help Meta regain momentum after lukewarm developer response to its Llama 4 AI model, CNBC reported Tuesday.\nMeta finance chief Susan Li discussed the company's Scale AI and related AI spending during the earnings call, saying \"we also made $15.1 billion in nonmarketable equity investments in the second quarter, which includes our minority investment in Scale AI, along with other investment activities.\"\nZuckerberg provided an outline for his vision of \"personal superintelligence\" in a letter he published Wednesday morning. He did not list any particular product or app that exemplifies his vision, but said the cutting-edge tech should be used for \"personal empowerment\" over automation and efficiency.\nThe CEO expanded on the company's AI investments during the earnings call, saying \"superintelligence empowers people to be more creative, develop culture and communities, connect with each other and lead more fulfilling lives.\"\n\"Over the last few months, we've begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves, and the improvement is slow for now, but undeniable,\" Zuckerberg said. \"Developing superintelligence, which we define as AI that surpasses human intelligence in every way we think, is now in sight.\"\nThe social media company said its total expenses for 2025 will fall in the range between $114 billion and $118 billion, which raises the low end of its prior outlook of between $113 billion and $118 billion.\nWhen asked about the company's growing capital expenditures, Li said during the earnings call that Meta is \"exploring ways to work with financial partners to co-develop data centers.\"\n\"We don't have any finalized transactions to announce, but we generally believe that there will be models here that will attract significant external financing to support large-scale data center projects that are developed using our ability to build world-class infrastructure,\" Li said.\nMeta's net income in the second quarter rose 36% year over year to $18.34 billion.\nThe company did not provide an outlook for fourth-quarter sales, but said it expects the year-over-year growth rate in that quarter \"to be slower than the third quarter as we lap a period of stronger growth in the fourth quarter of 2024.\"\nGoogle posted strong quarterly earnings results last week that beat on the top and bottom lines.\nAmazon and Reddit are scheduled to report their second-quarter earnings on Thursday.\nSnap will report its latest quarterly earnings on Tuesday followed by Pinterest, which will report its financials next Thursday."

Huffman didn't say exactly when Reddit Answers will expand.\n\"Recently, we celebrated Reddit's 20th year, and I've never been more excited about our business and potential than I am today,\" Huffman wrote. \"The internet is evolving, and our role as a community-powered platform for human connection is only becoming more critical.\"\nHuffman said that in order to focus on the \"most pressing needs,\" Reddit is \"deprioritizing a few initiatives,\" including its \"work on the user economy.\" Reddit's initial 2024 IPO prospectus detailed the company's efforts to build a user economy business, which could include games and online marketplaces akin to Roblox and Facebook Marketplace.\nInvestors have been closely monitoring the effects of Google's recent search engine changes and rise of AI-powered chat apps on Reddit's ability to obtain new users.\nHuffman spoke about some of AI's impact on Reddit's search-derived traffic on Thursday's earnings call, saying that while Reddit \"got off to a slower start in April,\" the company is now witnessing \"better traction as the quarter played out.\"\n\"Traffic from Google varies from week to week, but overall it was a headwind in Q2,\" Huffman said. \"But looking into Q3, our Q2 exit number was higher than the Q2 average of 110 million.\"\nHuffman acknowledged that Google's continual testing of newer generative AI powered features, such as AI Overview, \"affects everybody in the ecosystem.\" However, Huffman pointed to Reddit's growing name recognition among consumers as helping the company withstand any major changes, saying that \"Reddit is one of the most searched for terms on Google, because users around the internet go to Google with the intention of ending up on Reddit.\"\nThe company is aiming for more consumers to use the Reddit Answers feature to access comments and written conversations on the platform instead of only using search engines and AI-powered chat apps, Huffman explained.\n\"What users want is the Reddit perspective,\" Huffman said. \"And so as long as this is true, I think that's a great thing, and so regardless of how they get to Reddit, our job is to help internet consumers find the kind of answers to their questions and turn that into helping those users become regular core Reddit users as both the seekers and the scrollers.\"\nGoogle posted quarterly earnings last week that beat on the top and the bottom line, and Meta followed on Wednesday with better-than-expected results.\nNext week, Snap will report quarterly earnings on Tuesday followed by Pinterest on Thursday."

      "text": "President Donald Trump has made clear that he wants Apple to make iPhones in the U.S.\nApple CEO Tim Cook is doing what he can to appease the commander in chief, without making that ultimate concession.\nCook on Wednesday appeared at the White House with Trump to announce plans to spend about $600 billion over four years in the U.S. Apple didn't announce the made-in-USA iPhone that Trump wants, but Cook got to tout Apple's position on U.S. production.\nSome of Apple's most valuable parts, such as its glass and facial recognition sensor, are made by U.S. companies that Apple has worked with for years. Final assembly is only a small, though very critical, part of iPhone production.\n\"The final assembly that you focus on, that will be elsewhere for a while,\" Cook said Wednesday in the Oval Office.\nTrump appeared happy enough, for now.\n\"He makes many of the components here, and we've been talking about it,\" Trump said. \"The whole thing is set up in other places, and it's been there for a long time in terms of cost and all, but I think we may incentivize him enough that one day he'll be bringing that back.\"\nExperts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. Trump announced during the public meeting that the administration planned to place a tariff on chips that would double their price, but Apple \u2014 which relies on hundreds of different chips for its devices \u2014 would be exempt.\n\"CEOs are realizing that they do have to do something, and what they've discovered is that if they give the president something to brag about without destroying their company, that the problem might go away for a certain amount of time,\" said Peter Cohan, professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at Babson College who has written case studies on Apple.\nThe gambit worked. Apple stock rose 5% on Wednesday and another 3% on Thursday.\n\"What Tim Cook demonstrated in the first administration was a real savvy navigation of the treacherous waters,\" said Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments, which holds a position in Apple. \"I thought this announcement was super-important symbolically, because the president is looking for headlines.\"\nWhat Apple announced\nThe centerpiece of Apple's announcement was the so-called American Manufacturing Program, which Apple said was designed to incentivize other companies to make parts for computers in the U.S.\nBy Apple committing to purchase parts and expand its relationship with U.S. suppliers, it could give those companies the skills and capacity to expand their business. And it lets Apple take some credit for supporting the 450,000 total jobs at its suppliers.\nA closer look at the members of the program shows that Apple is leaning on some of its longest-tenured partners. All together, Apple said that its U.S. suppliers are on track to make 19 billion chips for its products this year. That level of business doesn't appear overnight.\nFor example, Apple said that all of its cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches would be made by Corning, in Kentucky, and that it would spend $2.5 billion on that effort. It's a powerful symbol \u2014 while the phone might be screwed together in China or India, the surface that users touch around the world will be made in the U.S.\nBut Apple has pointed to Corning as a critical American supplier in the past. The company's glass has been used on the iPhone since its first version in 2007. While Apple typically doesn't let its suppliers talk about their relationships, former COO Jeff Williams hailed Corning's glass in 2017, when it got an \"investment\" from the Apple Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Apple followed that up with a $250 million commitment in 2019, and $45 million in 2021.\nAnalysts are skeptical that the partnership could substantially improve Corning's revenue. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote on Thursday that Corning \"already produces 100% of the cover glass for Apple's phones and tablets,\" adding that Corning's glass business called Specialty Materials is worth about $2 billion per year.\nApple also highlighted its partnership with Coherent, a longtime supplier of lasers for Apple's facial recognition hardware, which is made in Texas. Morgan Stanley pegged the business at about $100 million per year, and said Apple has options including Lumentum and Sony.\nThe iPhone maker said it expanded a partnership with Texas Instruments to make chips in Texas and Utah. Texas Instruments has long supplied chips for the iPhone, such as circuits to control USB interfaces or power displays. Apple said it would partner with Samsung, another key supplier of parts like iPhone displays, to launch an \"innovative new technology for making chips,\" without offering additional details.\nApple declared that it will partner directly with companies in the semiconductor chain, even if they typically sell services or goods to Apple suppliers. Other partnerships are with Applied Materials, a tooling company, GlobalFoundries, a chip foundry, and GlobalWafers America, which is supplying Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Texas Instruments with made-in-USA wafers, the starting point for a batch of chips.\nGlobalFoundries manufactures chips for Broadcom, which supplies wireless chips for iPhones. Both will work with Apple to develop and manufacture 5G components in the U.S.\nMeanwhile, Apple will buy millions of advanced chips made by TSMC in Arizona, where it will be the factory's largest customer. Cook joined former President Joe Biden at the plant in 2022 and committed to buying chips from the factory.\nApple said it would invest in and become a customer at an Arizona Amkor facility, which packages and tests chips, the final stage before installation in a computer.\nApple also said it would expand existing data centers for artificial intelligence in North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Oregon. It's highlighted these data centers in the past in spending commitments.\nWhile Apple's announcement sent partner stocks up, JPMorgan Chase analysts warned in a note on Thursday that \"the new and expanded engagements might not be completely incremental to global revenues and outlook.\"\nTrump had a different take.\n\"Oh, I love that you're doing this,\" the president said, after reading a list of Apple's commitments.\n'Cost of doing business'\nApple has little to worry about when it comes to who will hold the company accountable for its promises. The company doesn't break out U.S. spending, and most of Apple's suppliers are contractually required to keep the information secret. Apple doesn't report how much its new campuses in Austin, Texas, or North Carolina end up costing.\nAdditionally, the $600 billion headline number likely includes lots of regular expenses.\nApple said in February that its $500 billion commitment included payments to U.S. suppliers, direct employment, data centers for Apple Intelligence and corporate facilities, as well as spending on Apple TV+ productions in 20 states.\nApple started publicly announcing U.S. spending during Trump's first administration in 2018, at a rate of about $70 billion per year. In February, the company committed to $125 billion per year. Wednesday's announcement brings that figure to $150 billion annually.\nThat's still a fraction of Apple's total spending.\nIn Apple's fiscal 2024, the company spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period.\nTeffler said she didn't think the newly announced spending would be material to Apple's profitability, especially since it already has relationships with the various companies such as Corning.\n\"They're going to spend money somewhere,\" Tegler said.\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives, who previously predicted a made-in-USA iPhone would cost billions to produce and would leave consumers paying $3,500, said the Wednesday announcements indicate a much different approach. He said it's \"the cost of doing business.\""

      "text": "Over the years, Meta has built a reputation for using rivals' innovations to bolster its technology. But its decision to copy a Chinese artificial intelligence lab in 2025 in an effort to compete with OpenAI backfired, forcing the company to overhaul its AI strategy.\nIn a rush to mimic the techniques developed by Chinese startup DeepSeek, Meta released a new version of its Llama family of AI models that disappointed third-party developers, according to people familiar with the matter. The reaction was so bad that CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided to spend billions of dollars to revamp the company's AI unit, and he's still considering more shake-ups to Meta's AI strategy, said the people, who asked not to be named due to confidentiality.\nWhen Meta reports second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, Zuckerberg will make the case to investors for his AI hiring spree and the company's related strategy shift.\nMeta's AI blitzkrieg kicked off in June, when it invested $14.3 billion into Scale AI, resulting in the data annotating startup's CEO, Alexandr Wang, joining Meta along with a handful of employees to oversee a cornerstone AI unit. This new Meta Superintelligence Labs will be led by Wang, now Meta's chief AI officer, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who also joined the company in June along with business partner Daniel Gross.\nGross was previously the CEO of AI startup Safe Superintelligence, which Meta tried to buy before being rebuffed by co-founder Ilya Sutskever. While Meta couldn't land the AI pioneer and former OpenAI co-founder, it did hire multiple top researchers from competitors like the ChatGPT maker, Apple and Google to help it regain its footing in the fiercely competitive artificial intelligence market. One such hire was ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao, who Zuckerberg last week named as his new AI lab's chief scientist.\nAlthough Meta's AI talent grab may not result in the company raising its projection for 2025 total expenses, estimated to come in between $113 billion to $118 billion, Cantor analysts said in a note published earlier this month that the investment potentially \"moves the target above the low end.\" Translation: all that hiring comes with a cost, albeit slight.\nMeanwhile, revenue growth in the second quarter likely slowed to 15%, down from 22% a year earlier, according to LSEG. It would be the slowest rate of expansion for the company since early 2023, and analysts are expecting lower levels of growth in the coming quarters.\nZuckerberg believes that new AI talent as part of the Superintelligence unit is worth it if Meta can regain its momentum and potentially create more powerful AI technology that steamrolls the competition, CNBC reported in June.\nFor Meta, Llama 4 represented the company's answer to competing models from rivals like OpenAI, and executives have viewed it as helping the company dominate a potential computing platform of the future.\nSimilar to other Meta-incubated technologies like the PyTorch AI developer tools, the company released Llama to the open-source community, which can then access and use the software for free, subject to certain licensing terms.\nWhile the predecessor, Llama 3, was a hit with developers, they haven't taken to Llama 4 because it's seen by some as more difficult to customize and integrate into their apps. That's resulted in many coders preferring Llama 3 over its successor, people familiar with the matter said. Additionally, Zuckerberg lost confidence in his generative AI team and its leadership in part due to a controversy over whether Meta may have gamed certain industry AI benchmark tests, the people said.\nLlama 4's struggles can be traced back to January, when the sudden rise and ensuing popularity of the open-source R1 AI model by DeepSeek caught Meta off guard, leading to a reevaluation of Llama's underlying architecture, the people said.\nDeepSeek's R1 is a so-called mixture-of-experts AI model, or MoE. R1 is similar to OpenAI's o1 family of models that can be trained to excel at multistep tasks like solving math equations or writing code.\nBy contrast, Llama's models \u2014 before their latest release - were dense AI models, which are generally simpler for most AI developers to fine-tune and incorporate into their own apps, the people said.\nAI labs like OpenAI and Anthropic, researchers say, have been pushing MoE models to power AI agents that can perform a variety of step-by-step tasks. Those companies keep their designs closely guarded from competitors. OpenAI has been developing an AI model for the open-source community, but CEO Sam Altman said earlier this month that its debut is delayed indefinitely pending safety tests and other reviews.\nAlthough Meta has previously published research on MoE models, DeepSeek's release to the open-source community wowed researchers because R1 appeared to be less expensive to train and run compared with other AI models, experts said.\nSuddenly, Meta executives thought they had a clearer picture into how to create their own efficient and possibly cheaper MoE models, potentially leapfrogging rivals like OpenAI, people familiar with the matter said.\nStill, some staff members in Meta's GenAI unit pushed for Llama 4 to remain a dense AI model, which though generally less efficient, is still powerful, and Meta originally planned on that architecture acting as the backbone supporting improved voice recognition capabilities, the people said.\nUltimately, Meta went with the MoE approach, due in part to DeepSeek's innovations and the promise of pulling ahead of OpenAI, the people said. Meta released two small versions in April and said a \"Behemoth\" version would come at a later date.\nBut the new MoE architecture disappointed some developers, who were simply hoping Llama 4 would be a souped-up version of Llama 3, people familiar with the matter said. Llama 4 also failed to deliver a significant leap over competing open-source models from China, the people said.\nExecutives at Meta as well as the Superintelligence Labs' high-profile hires are now questioning the company's current open-source AI strategy, and have considered skipping the release of Behemoth in favor of developing a more powerful proprietary AI model, the people said.\nA Meta spokesperson said in a statement that the company's \"position on open source AI is unchanged.\"\n\"We plan to continue releasing leading open source models,\" the spokesperson said. \"We haven't released everything we've developed historically and we expect to continue training a mix of open and closed models going forward.\"\nThe New York Times first reported that Meta was considering upending its open-source AI strategy.\nMeta's core business remains strong\nDespite Meta's AI struggles, the company's core online ad business remains strong, and investors are hopeful that the recent AI investments and hiring will eventually pay off.\nZuckerberg said in July that the company would invest \"hundreds of billions of dollars\" into building out the computing infrastructure needed to power cutting-edge AI projects.\n\"Meta Superintelligence Labs will have industry-leading levels of compute and by far the greatest compute per researcher,\" Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post.\nAnalysts at Bank of America said in a note this month that Zuckerberg's comments indicate \"a sign of confidence in Meta's revenue trajectory.\" The analysts said that his statement also \"implies higher future Capex and Opex,\" which potentially equates to even more AI spending.\n\"We also see the post as reaching out to AI talent, signaling Meta as a place for AI innovation,\" the analysts wrote. \"We expect AI investment to be a top focus area on the upcoming earnings call, and Meta likely needs to make a case for strong AI returns to drive multiple expansion.\"\nMeta and its rivals' pursuit of AI researchers echoes the self-driving car frenzy of 2017, when companies like Google and Uber competed fiercely for talent, doling out \"similarly crazy kind of pay packages across the board,\" said Megh Gautam, chief product officer at deal-tracking firm Crunchbase.\n\"The dynamics still feel very much like a winner-take-all-market, so you're trying your best to give yourself the best shot possible to go make that happen,\" Gautam said.\nInvestors appear more receptive to Meta's AI spending and strategy shifts, a contrast with a few years ago when the company was heavily pushing the metaverse, said Uday Cheruvu, an analyst and portfolio manager at Harding Loevner, which owns Meta shares.\nOpenAI, Google and Anthropic are also trying to hire and maintain talent all while continuing to spend billions of dollars on developing their respective AI models, Cheruvu said.\n\"Now with AI, it's not just Meta \u2013 everyone else is doing it, so now the euphoria is much higher,\" Cheruvu said.\nWATCH: Meta's ambitious AI plans."

      "text": "A tale of two different technology companies is playing out this earnings season as President Donald Trump's global trade upheaval makes planning nearly impossible.\nBusinesses reliant on advertising appear to be holding on for the near-term as those dependent on consumer spending have started to feel the cracks of a murky macro subjected to an ever-shifting tariff policy.\nBlock offered a lackluster second-quarter profit outlook in its earnings release Thursday, and said it took into account a \"more cautious stance\" into the end of the year. Airbnb issued disappointing guidance and said its business experienced some \"softness\" in travel from Canada to the U.S. toward the end of the quarter.\n\"In the U.S., we've seen relatively softer results, which we believe has been largely driven by broader economic uncertainties,\" the vacation rentals company said in a letter to shareholders.\nThe fortress technology giants are also proving susceptible to Trump's whims.\nApple CEO Tim Cook said Thursday that the company anticipates $900 million in added costs from tariffs this quarter, but said it's \"very difficult\" to predict beyond that timeframe due to uncertainty.\nHe also said Apple is sourcing products shipped to the U.S. from India and Vietnam \u2014 where tariffs are lower.\n\"We do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin,\" he said. \"Vietnam will be the country of origin for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and AirPods products sold in the U.S.\"\nAmazon's e-commerce business, which relies on many sellers that ship from China, is also beginning to feel the pressure. The company issued light guidance for the current quarter, and said \"tariffs and trade policies\" and \"recessionary fears\" were factors in its outlook.\nTrump recently hiked the import duty on goods from China to 145%. Amazon is also grappling with the expiration of the de minimis loophole that previously allowed imports under $800 to enter the U.S. duty free.\nFinance chief Brian Olsavsky said the company offered a wide guidance range due to tariff unpredictability.\nBut Amazon's advertising business was a silver lining in the report, jumping 19% from last year. Other ad-heavy businesses also reported strong results in this macroeconomic setup, but warned of possibly tougher waters ahead.\nAlphabet reported a year-over-year jump in ad revenue, but warned that the de minimis changes would \"cause a slight headwind\" to its ad business this year, particularly in Asia. Meta's ad revenues topped estimates, but finance chief Susan Li said some Asia e-commerce retailers have curbed ad spending. \"\n\"A portion of that spend has been redirected to other markets, but overall spend for those advertisers is below the levels prior to April,\" she said.\nWorsening consumer sentiment isn't just a tech problem. Airlines, restaurants and consumer retailers are also feeling the pinch.\nDelta Airlines cut its growth plans for 2025 and trimmed its first-quarter guidance on weakening demand, while Chipotle Mexican Grill blamed a \"slowdown consumer spending\" as a reason for a decline in same-store sales.\nU.S. consumers also appear less optimistic about the economy. Last month, the expectations index from the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey fell to its lowest level since October 2011.\nBoard officials said the reading is consistent with a recession."

      "text": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to continue his company's artificial intelligence spending blitz well into the next year as rival tech giants do the same.\nZuckerberg told analysts Wednesday during a second-quarter earnings call that AI's rapid pace of progress has informed much of Meta's recent business decisions, including the company's $14.3 billion June investment into the data-annotating startup Scale AI as part of a revamped AI strategy involving a wave of high-profile hires.\nAI's swift advancement warrants that Meta have \"the absolute best and most elite talent-dense team\" that can access the resources they need from a \"leading compute fleet,\" Zuckerberg said about the AI Superintelligence team he assembled for his company this summer. Whatever these top-tier AI researchers build can then be implemented throughout Facebook, Instagram and the rest of the company's family of apps, he said.\n\"When we take a technology, we're good at driving that through all of our apps and our ad systems,\" Zuckerberg said. \"There's no other company that is as good as us at kind of taking something and getting it in front of billions of people.\"\nThose AI endeavors, however, come at a cost.\nMeta on Wednesday said it expects its total expenses for 2025 to come in the range of $114 billion and $118 billion, raising the low end of its previous outlook of between $113 billion and $118 billion. And while Meta is still planning out next year, the company said its AI initiatives will \"result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.\"\nOther tech giants are also spending heavy on AI projects and talent.\nAlphabet said last week during its earnings report that it is raising its 2025 capital expenditures forecast to $85 billion, which is $10 billion higher from its prior forecast. Microsoft said Wednesday that its fiscal first-quarter capital expenditures will be $30 billion, ahead of analyst expectations of $24.23 billion.\nFor now, investors are OK with Meta's big AI investments, with the company's shares up nearly 12% in after-hour trading on Wednesday. It helps that Meta reported strong second-quarter earnings that beat on the top and bottom while providing third-quarter sales guidance that topped Wall Street expectations.\nIt also helps that Zuckerberg said AI drove \"greater efficiency and gains across our ad system,\" likely reassuring worried investors that Meta's big AI spending is leading to some immediate results.\nAnd while the company's Reality Labs unit continues bleeding money, posting an operating loss of $4.53 billion in the second quarter, the surprise hit of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses seems to have quelled investor discontent for the time being.\n\"I continue to think that glasses are basically going to be the ideal form factor for AI, because you can let an AI see what you see throughout the day, hear what you hear, talk to you,\" Zuckerberg said. \"Once you get a display in there, whether it's the kind of wide holographic field of view, like we showed with Orion, or just a smaller display that might be good for displaying some information, that's going to unlock a lot of value, where you can just interact with an AI system throughout the day.\"\nWATCH: I like Meta as a stock, don't love it, prefer Google."

      "text": "For nearly a decade, Tom Wahlin's popular travel gear site Pack Hacker ranked high in Google's search results by publishing deeply researched product reviews.\nBut something changed this year, as Wahlin noticed that his company's reviews were often falling below a series of Reddit links. A few weeks ago, for example, Wahlin discovered that when he searched for the Aer Travel Pack 3, Pack Hacker's review of the premium backpack was no longer leading Google's results, which it had been for a \"very, very long time,\" he said.\nThe Reddit links that preceded his site all sent users to various forums where users discussed the popular travel backpack. In a particular twist of fate, the top Reddit post included several comments about Pack Hacker's YouTube video review of the bag.\n\"It's funny, because we're mentioned in that Reddit post,\" Wahlin said. \"Pack Hacker is mentioned a couple of different times, but we're still below the Reddit result.\"\nReddit's rise in search rankings is the result of a series of updates by Google stemming back to last year that boosted \"authentic\" content from online forums. Because Reddit dwarfs other forum sites, the 19-year-old company was likely the biggest beneficiary of the Google update, said Lily Ray, the vice president of search engine optimization and research at the Amsive marketing agency.\nAmsive found that Reddit is ranked fifth among U.S. sites in terms of visibility in Google's U.S. organic search results as of July, up from 68th a year ago.\n\"I think the rate of growth that Reddit has seen is something pretty unusual for our industry,\" Ray said.\nThe challenge for Reddit, which held its stock market debut five months ago, is to make money off people who land on the company's website after performing a random query. Reddit calls them logged-out users and, based on some industry estimates, they only monetize at about one-third the rate of logged-in users.\nAs Reddit said in its financial filings, \"logged-out users typically have lower engagement and spend less time on our platform compared to users who are logged in to a registered account.\" Getting a greater percentage of them to sign up with Reddit, and even download the app, is critical to the company's effort to bolster its reputation on Wall Street.\nIn Reddit's second-quarter earnings report last week, the company said its user base increased 51% in the second quarter to 91.2 million, outpacing ad revenue growth of 41%. The number of logged-out users surpassed logged-in users in the fourth quarter, and the gap has since widened. Logged-in users increased 31% in the second quarter to 42 million, while logged-out users increased at a much more robust rate of 74% to 49.2 million.\nWhile results for the period ended June topped estimates across the board and Reddit's net loss narrowed dramatically from a year prior, the stock dropped after the report. Reddit shares have now fallen 26% since peaking in mid-July, and are up just 8% since their IPO pop in March.\nReddit's business comes almost entirely from digital ads, at least for the moment. The company recently signed data-licensing deals with Google and OpenAI for the training of their large language models that are powering the boom in generative artificial intelligence. Reddit's \"other revenue\" category, which includes data licensing, skyrocketed 691% year over year in the quarter to $28.1 million, accounting for 10% of total sales.\nOutside of data licensing, Google is the biggest catalyst for Reddit's growth.\nAlan Gould, managing director at Loop Capital, said Google makes up \"the vast majority of the logged-out users.\" By extension, surging traffic from the search giant is a big reason why Reddit is generating less money from each user in the U.S.\n'First-class problem'\nReddit's user base in the U.S. increased by 59% in the second quarter from a year earlier. But average revenue per user (ARPU) fell 5% to $4.94 from $5.21. Daniel Konstantinovic, an analyst at eMarketer, noted that logged-out users don't need to provide personal data like email addresses, which is information that could help Reddit better \"track users and deliver ads and target them with specific advertisements.\"\n\"An advertiser is going to look at that and say, OK, well, it doesn't seem as if I can reach these people more effectively in any way,\" Konstantinovic said.\nBenjamin Black, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said \"a lot of Reddit monetization actually happens in the home feed,\" so the company needs a growing number of logged-out users to create accounts.\n\"Their logged-out users have been just flocking in and finding value on the platform,\" said Black, who recommends buying Reddit shares. \"Over time, those convert to logged-in users, and they'll become more valuable on the platform.\"\nBy 2025, Reddit's logged-in users could represent an ARPU of $17.60 compared to $5.90 for logged-out users, Black said, based on the firm's estimates. Reddit doesn't break out those figures.\nReddit operating chief Jen Wong told analysts on the second-quarter earnings call that the company emphasizes revenue and user growth over ARPU. She said the company is in the \"fortunate position of having really strong revenue and user growth with users being a little bit more, and that's why ARPU is down.\"\n\"It may be a first-class problem that we have in the math of ARPU,\" Wong said.\nReddit CEO Steve Huffman said on the earnings call that the company is increasing users and retention driven in part by new features and investments into AI.\n\"They'll come, they'll download our app,\" Huffman said. And when they come to the website, all the company's work \"around relevancy and product quality come into play to retain those users,\" he said.\nHuffman told CNBC that it's easier than ever for new users to create accounts, due to a streamlined process that requires users to submit either an email address or a phone number or sign in via a Google or Apple account.\n\"The registration rates have gone way up because we're losing far fewer users when they sign up,\" Huffman said.\nReddit's improved personalization features also means that new users are recommended more Reddit posts and communities, or subreddits, related to their search queries, keeping them engaged for longer, Huffman said. He added that the company has bolstered the overall speed of the site, making it a better experience for new users.\n\"User retention has grown, which is leading to the logged-in growth, which is something we're really happy with,\" Huffman said. He said the 31% year-over-year increase in logged-in users in the second quarter is the highest in years.\nStill, some experts are skeptical that logged-out users will choose to stick around after they land on a particular Reddit post.\n\"I just don't see a clear path to getting someone who's going to Reddit through Google to logging in and spending more time on it beyond whatever it is that they're specifically looking for,\" Konstantinovic said. \"If you look at the changes that Google has made, it's all about surfacing the answer or the desired result as quickly as possible, so it doesn't really make sense that the user would then go to Reddit and spend even more time there on stuff that is not specific to their query.\"\nGoogle risk\nReddit also faces the risk any company confronts when traffic is reliant on Google, because the algorithm can change at any time. Reddit acknowledges in its filings that \"changes in internet search engine algorithms and dynamics could have a negative impact on traffic for our website and, ultimately, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\"\nIt's a problem that many websites have faced over the years, from recipe sites to online coupon providers. And it was an algorithm tweak that pushed Pack Hacker's reviews below Reddit content earlier this year.\n\"Some brands survive and some brands die,\" said Wahlin, who sold Pack Hacker to outdoor and fitness publisher AllGear Digital in January, though he still oversees editorial operations. \"Things always change.\"\nWahlin said his traffic from Google hasn't totally fallen off, and that he's long been preparing for a potential change in the algorithm by diversifying his business with YouTube channels, a paid membership program and brand recognition that makes Pack Hacker a destination site.\nReddit is currently the beneficiary of Google's algorithm, but that can change.\n\"We definitely talk about it in the SEO space \u2014 like buying stock, buying Reddit stock \u2014 because they just keep going up on Google,\" Ray, the SEO expert, said. \"But it's just impossible to know how long it's going to last and if it's going to continue.\"\nGoogle declined to comment. The company pointed to previous blog posts about how it's prioritizing content that features more human voices and perspectives.\nHuffman said Reddit has a history of growing its user base \"without SEO, because you don't get the search traffic unless you have content in the index.\" Huffman said the company built content \"entirely through word of mount\" for about the first decade.\nHuffman described Reddit's direct traffic as \"really resilient\" regardless of what Google is doing.\n\"That's different than other publishers or content platforms where the content is more commoditized,\" he said. \"Reddit is truly unique, and so that's a real strength.\""

      "text": "Meta shares rose as much as 5% Wednesday after the company reported stronger-than-expected revenue in the first quarter and provided second-quarter guidance that was in line with Wall Street's expectations.\nHere's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:\n- Earnings per share: $6.43 vs. $5.28 expected\n- Revenue: $42.31 billion vs. $41.40 billion expected\nMeta's first-quarter sales rose 16% year over year while net income jumped 35% to $16.64 billion, up from $12.37 billion a year earlier.\nSecond-quarter sales will be in the range of $42.5 billion to $45.5 billion, said Meta finance chief Susan Li. That was in line with analysts expectations of $44.03 billion. However, Li also added that the company has begun to see some reduced ad spend from Asia e-commerce exporters.\n\"Our business is also performing very well, and I think we're well positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts on an earnings call on Wednesday.\nMeta said that it lowered the range of its 2025 total expenses, which will now come in between $113 billion to $118 billion. That figure was previously $114 billion to $119 billion.\nHowever, Meta increased its 2025 capital expenditures to come in the range of $64 billion to $72 billion, up from its prior outlook of $60 billion to $65 billion.\n\"This updated outlook reflects additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware,\" the company said in the earnings release.\nThe increase in expected infrastructure hardware is the result of \"suppliers who source from countries around the world,\" Li said.\n\"There's just a lot of uncertainty around this, given the ongoing trade discussions,\" said Li, adding that Meta is \"working on our end on mitigations by optimizing our supply chain.\"\nThe company also warned that a recent decision by the European Commission could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and cause \"a significant impact\" to Meta's European business and revenue as soon as the third quarter. The company said this is the result of the EC deciding that Meta's no-ads subscription service for European users is not in compliance with one of its regulations.\n\"We are continuing to engage actively with the European Commission further on this, so we hope to have more clarity by next quarter's call,\" Li said.\nThe company's advertising revenue for the first quarter came in at $41.39 billion, ahead of Wall Street projections of $40.44 billion.\nMeta's Reality Labs hardware division posted an operating loss of $4.2 billion in the first quarter, which was less than the $4.6 billion figure that Wall Street was expecting. However, Reality Labs' sales came in at $412 million, which was down 6% from a year ago and came in below analysts' expectations of $492.7 million.\nDaily active users rose to 3.43 billion in the first quarter, topping analyst estimates of 3.39 billion. That's up from 3.35 billion in the previous quarter.\nThe company's Threads microblogging service now has 350 million monthly users, Zuckerberg said. That's up from 320 million in January. Meta last week said that all \"eligible advertisers globally\" will be able to run ads on Threads. Meta does not expect Threads ads to meaningfully drive revenue growth in 2025, Li said Wednesday.\nThe Meta AI digital assistant now has nearly 1 billion monthly users, Zuckerberg said. In January, the company said the AI service had 700 million monthly users. WhatsApp is the primary way people access Meta AI, Li said. The company on Tuesday released a standalone Meta AI app, confirming a February report from CNBC.\nZuckerberg said that he envisions Meta AI as a place to show ads and that the company could charge for a premium version of the assistant, but Meta will focus on building the product for at least the next year before beginning to monetize it.\nMeta said its employee headcount was 76,834 as of March 31, representing an 11% year-over-year increase. The company in February laid off 5% of its workforce that it deemed as its lowest performers.\nThe company recorded $8.22 billion in first-quarter advertising sales stemming from the Asia-Pacific region. Analysts expected Meta to post $8.42 billion in Asia-Pacific ad sales for the quarter.\nLi told analysts that the company has \"seen some reduced spend in the U.S. from Asia based e-commerce exporters.\" The company believes that is in anticipation of the de minimis loophole ending on Friday, Li said.\n\"A portion of that spend has been redirected to other markets, but overall spend for those advertisers is below the levels prior to April,\" Li said.\nSnap on Tuesday and Google last week warned of potential headwinds affecting their respective advertising businesses due to macroeconomic uncertainty.\nWhen Google reported first-quarter earnings last Thursday, company executives told analysts that it is likely the search giant will experience headwinds to its online ad business stemming from Asia. Regarding the broader economy, Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said \"it's still too early in the second quarter to have a more specific view of things.\"\nSnap, which also relies on online advertising, reported its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Its stock price plunged after the company said it couldn't provide forward guidance due to macroeconomic uncertainties."

      "text": "Alphabet reported second-quarter results on Wednesday that beat on revenue and earnings, but the company said it would raise its capital investments by $10 billion in 2025.\nShares of the company were up as much as 3% in after-hours trading.\nHere's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:\n- Revenue: $96.43 billion vs. $94 billion expected\n- Earnings per share: $2.31 vs. $2.18 expected\nWall Street is also watching several other numbers in the report:\n- YouTube advertising revenue: $9.8 billion vs. $9.56 billion, according to StreetAccount\n- Google Cloud revenue: $13.62 billion vs. $13.11 billion, according to StreetAccount\n- Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $14.71 billion vs. $14.18 billion, according to StreetAccount\nThe company's overall revenue grew 14% year over year, higher than the 10.9% Wall Street expected, but Alphabet is going to spend more on artificial intelligence in 2025 than it anticipated.\nIn February, the company said it expected to invest $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 as it continues to expand on its AI strategy. That was already above the $58.84 billion Wall Street expected at the time.\nThe company increased that figure on Wednesday to $85 billion, saying it was raising it due to \"strong and growing demand for our Cloud products and services.\" The company expects to further increase capital expenditures in 2026, Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi said on an earnings call.\nThe company reported revenue of $13.62 billion for its cloud computing business, which is a 32% increase from a year ago. Last week, OpenAI announced that it expected to use Google's cloud infrastructure for its popular ChatGPT service. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said \"we are very excited to be partnering with them.\"\nAlphabet's net income increased to $28.20 billion, up nearly 20% from the previous year.\nThe company's search and advertising units still showed growth in the second quarter despite AI competition heating up. The company's search unit brought in $54.19 billion during the quarter, and its advertising revenue grew to $71.34 billion \u2014 up about 10.4% from $64.61 billion the year prior.\nYouTube advertising revenue came in at $9.8 billion, higher than Wall Street expected.\nThe company said its \"Other Bets\" segment, which includes its self-driving car unit Waymo and life sciences unit Verily, brought in $373 million \u2014 up from $365 million a year ago. Other Bets reported a loss of $1.25 billion, up from the $1.13 billion a year ago.\nAI Overviews, Google's AI search product that summarizes search results, now has upward of two billion monthly users across more than 200 countries and territories, Pichai said during Wednesday's earnings call. That's up from 1.5 billion monthly users last quarter.\nThe Gemini app, which has the company's AI chatbot, now has more than 450 million monthly active users, Pichai said.\nWhen asked about large spending on AI talent, Ashkenazi said Alphabet makes \"sure that we invest appropriately to have the best and brightest minds in the industry.\"\nGoogle made a splash in the AI talent wars, announcing earlier in July that it would bring in Windsurf CEO Varun Mohan and other top researchers at the AI coding startup as part of a $2.4 billion deal that also includes licensing the company's technology.\nTotal operating expenses increased 20% to $26.1 billion, Ashkenazi said on Wednesday. The biggest driver of growth was expenses for legal and other matters due in part to a $1.4 billion charge related to a settlement, she said on Wednesday's earnings call. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in May announced a $1.37 billion settlement with Google related to a data privacy rights lawsuit it made against the company in 2022.\nAshkenazi said Alphabet's third-quarter revenue \"could see a tailwind\" due to several reasons. That includes a negative impact for advertising, which benefited from \"strong spend on U.S. elections\" in late 2024, particularly on YouTube, she said."

      "text": "OpenAI on Thursday announced GPT-5, its latest and most advanced large-scale artificial intelligence model.\nThe company is making GPT-5 available to everyone, including its free users. OpenAI said the model is smarter, faster and \"a lot more useful,\" particularly across domains like writing, coding and health care.\n\"I tried going back to GPT-4, and it was quite miserable,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a briefing with reporters.\nSince launching its AI chatbot ChatGPT in 2022, OpenAI has rocketed into the mainstream. The company said it expects to hit 700 million weekly active users on ChatGPT this week, and it is in talks with investors about a potential stock sale at a valuation of roughly $500 billion, as CNBC previously reported.\nOpenAI said GPT-5's hallucination rate is lower, which means the model fabricates answers less frequently. The company said it also carried out extensive safety evaluations while developing GPT-5, including 5,000 hours of testing.\nInstead of outright refusing to answer users' questions if they are potentially risky, GPT-5 will use \"safe completions,\" OpenAI said. This means the model will give high-level responses within safety constraints that can't be used to cause harm.\n\"GPT-5 has been trained to recognize when a task can't be finished, avoid speculation and can explain limitations more clearly, which reduces unsupported claims compared to prior models,\" said Michelle Pokrass, a post-training lead at OpenAI.\nDuring the briefing, OpenAI demonstrated how GPT-5 can be used for \"vibe coding,\" which is a term for when users generate software with AI based on a simple written prompt.\nThe company asked GPT-5 to create a web app that could help an English speaker learn French. The app had to have an engaging theme and include activities like flash cards and quizzes as well as a way to track daily progress. OpenAI submitted the same prompt into two GPT-5 windows, and it generated two different apps within seconds.\nThe apps had \"some rough edges,\" an OpenAI lead said, but users can make additional tweaks to the AI-generated software, like changing the background or adding additional tabs, as they see fit.\nGPT-5 is rolling out to OpenAI's Free, Plus, Pro and Team users on Thursday. This launch will be the first time that Free users have access to a reasoning model, which is a type of model that \"thinks,\" or carries out an internal chain of thought, before responding. If Free users hit their usage cap, they'll have access to GPT-5 mini.\nOpenAI's Plus users have higher usage limits, and Pro users have unlimited access to GPT-5 as well as access to GPT-5 Pro. ChatGPT Edu and ChatGPT Enterprise users will get access to GPT-5 roughly a week from Thursday.\n\"It's hard to believe it's only been two and a half years since @sama joined us in Redmond to show the world GPT-4 for the first time in Bing, and it's incredible to see how far we've come since that moment,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a Thursday X post, referring to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's appearance at Microsoft headquarters in Washington in February 2023.\nThe new model is coming to Microsoft products Thursday, according to a company blog post. Microsoft 365 Copilot is getting GPT-5, as well as the Copilot for consumers and the Azure AI Foundry that developers can use to incorporate AI models into third-party applications.\nBox, a company that helps enterprises manage their computer files, has been testing GPT-5 across a wide variety of data sets in recent weeks.\nAaron Levie, the CEO of Box, said previous AI models have failed many of the company's most advanced tests because they struggle to make sense of complex math or logic within long documents. But Levie said GPT-5 is a \"complete breakthrough.\"\n\"The model is able to retain way more of the information that it's looking at, and then use a much higher level of reasoning and logic capabilities to be able to make decisions,\" Levie told CNBC in an interview.\nOpenAI is releasing three different versions of the model for developers through its application programming interface, or API. Those versions, gpt-5, gpt-5-mini and gpt-5-nano, are designed for different cost and latency needs.\nEarlier this week, OpenAI released two open-weight language models for the first time since it rolled out GPT-2 in 2019. Those models were built to serve as lower-cost options that developers, researchers and companies can easily run and customize.\nBut with GPT-5, OpenAI also has a broader consumer audience in mind. The company said interacting with the model feels natural and \"more human.\"\nAltman said GPT-5 is like having a team of Ph.D.-level experts on hand at any time.\n\"People are limited by ideas, but not really the ability to execute, in many new ways,\" he said.\n--CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this post"
