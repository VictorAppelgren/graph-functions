      "title": "Taylor Swift has become a Beanie Baby, turning from a celebrity into an economy of her own",
      "summary": "The article explores how Taylor Swift has turned herself into a quasi‑commodity, using limited‑time releases, scarcity tactics, and parasocial engagement to drive fan spending and maintain a $1.6 billion personal brand. It compares her strategy to historic collectibles like Beanie Babies, noting that Swift’s constant content output and controlled scarcity keep demand high. Psychologists explain how fans’ emotional attachment is amplified by social‑media cues and “easter eggs,” turning fandom into a gamified, consumer‑driven phenomenon. While the author acknowledges the inevitable market correction, Swift’s marketing machine continues to inflate her bubble, raising questions about its long‑term sustainability. The piece underscores the broader trend of celebrities monetizing personal narratives in the age of streaming and social media.",
