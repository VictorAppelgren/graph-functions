  "description": "Europe's rearmament would lift the region's overall demand for industrial metals by 6% by 2027, according to Goldman Sachs.",
  "content": "Defense stocks have soared this year as European governments ramp up military budgets, and the spending spree could deliver a windfall in another corner of the market.\"As markets focus on Russia-Ukraine talks and as European defense spending ramps up, we estimate a large boost to industrial metals demand from rising EU defense spending,\" wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a Thursday note.Goldman estimates the defense sector already accounts for about 3% of global demand for industrial metals, ranging from about 2% of global steel demand to 7% of nickel demand.The MSCI Europe Aerospace and Defense Index has surged 72% higher this year to date. Meanwhile, the US-focused S&P Aerospace and Defense Select Industry Index has climbed 31% over the same period.The rally in defense stocks followed the European Union's commitments to boost military budgets amid heightened security concerns \u2014 and renewed pressure from Washington for NATO allies to spend more.Goldman's analysts expect euro-area military spending to rise from 1.9% of GDP in 2024 to 2.7% by 2027, adding about 167 billion euros, or $196 billion, to annual budgets.Around 40% of that spending boost is likely to flow into the procurement of metals-heavy equipment \u2014 roughly double NATO's typical 20% norm.Goldman estimates Europe's rearmament will lift the region's overall demand for industrial metals by 6% by 2027 \u2014 an \"impressive\" jump given that defense made up only about 2% of Europe's metals use in 2023.Globally, Goldman projects Europe's rearmament could add 0.9% to copper demand, 1.3% to nickel, and 0.4% to steel by 2027.Copper \u2014 one of the world's most commonly used metals \u2014 stands out.Goldman estimates the defense-driven bump could lift global copper demand growth from 2% to 2.4% annually. Copper runs through nearly every military system \u2014 not just vehicles and weaponry, but also the wiring, power, and communications networks that make them work.The boom in AI data center infrastructure is also driving demand for copper.The demand from defense and AI could ripple into prices. Goldman flagged upside risk to its 2026 and 2027 copper price forecasts of $10,000 and $10,750 per metric ton, respectively, even as high inventories may cap gains in the near term.Benchmark 3-month copper futures on the London Metal Exchange are trading around $9,797 per ton.",

  "summary": "Defense stocks have surged this year as European governments increase their military budgets, leading to a significant boost in industrial metals demand. Goldman Sachs analysts predict that the defense sector will contribute to this increase, accounting for around 3% of global demand for industrial metals. The increase in military spending is expected to increase from 1.9% of GDP in 2024 to 2.7% by 2027, adding about 167 billion euros, or $196 billion, to annual budgets. Goldman predicts that Europe's rearmament could significantly increase copper demand, nickel, and steel by 2026. The surge in defense stocks could also positively impact prices.",
