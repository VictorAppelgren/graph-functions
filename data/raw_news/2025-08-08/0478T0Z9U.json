  "description": "The Trump administration is reportedly probing the office of Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, over her fraud case against President Donald Trump last year, which resulted in a penalty of more than half a billion dollars.The Justice Department has opened an investigation into James\u2019 office, with the acting U.S. attorney in Albany hitting her with two subpoenas this week, according to reports.One of the subpoenas relates to James\u2019 fraud case against Trump, while the other involves her case against the National Rifle Association.The federal probe is looking at whether James violated Trump\u2019s civil rights as well as the NRA\u2019s during those cases.Trump and James have been locked in multiple vicious legal battles for years.No one is above the law.\u2014 Tish James (@TishJames) May 30, 2024Shortly after she was elected in 2018, James promised to \u201cuse every area of the law\u201d to go after Trump, his family, and his business, and she has made good on that vow.In 2022, James sued Trump, accusing the New York real estate mogul and his children of lying to lenders and insurers by inflating the value of his properties by billions of dollars, including Trump Tower in Manhattan and Mar-a-Lago in Florida.She sought to prohibit Trump and his children from running a business in New York ever again.A judge fined Trump $300 million in the case, which has since grown to more than $500 million with interest.

      "text": "Letitia James and Donald Trump's history of clashes\nEven before she took office as New York's attorney general, Letitia James has had Donald Trump in her sights.\nOn the night she was elected in 2018, the former city councilwoman and public defender took aim at Mr Trump.\n\"He should know that we here in New York - and I, in particular - we are not scared of you,\" she warned.\nShe pledged to shine \"a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings, and every dealing, demanding truthfulness at every turn\".\nMs James, 63, launched a civil suit against Mr Trump and the Trump Organization for allegedly lying \"by billions\" about the value of real estate in order to get favourable loans and pay less tax.\nThe former president, in turn, called it a \"witch hunt\" and branded Ms James - the first black person elected as New York attorney general - a \"racist\".\nOn Tuesday, a New York judge sided with Ms James, ruling that Mr Trump had committed fraud by repeatedly misrepresenting his wealth by hundreds of millions of dollars.\nThe former president doubled-down on his criticism of Ms James once again in response, calling her \"biased and corrupt\". His legal team indicated they would appeal against the ruling.\nHer feud with Mr Trump has been bubbling since his rise to the national political stage. But it is not the Brooklyn native's only high-profile legal battle.\nHer investigations into the highly influential National Rifle Association, the undercounting of Covid deaths in New York nursing homes, and accusations of sexual harassment against former New York governor and Democratic ally Andrew Cuomo, have earned her a national reputation.\nThe civil lawsuit against Mr Trump dramatically boosted Ms James' political profile as she headed into her November 2022 re-election campaign.\nMr Trump then responded with his customary name-calling, accusing \"Letitia Peekaboo James\" of a politically-motivated campaign against him.\nHe styled her a \"failed\" attorney general who dropped out of the 2022 governor's race, who was persecuting him due to bad poll numbers. He noted that the lawsuit comes only two months before voters decide whether to hand her a second term as attorney general.\nMs James shrugged off the insults, saying they had no bearing on her investigation or the potential outcome in court.\n\"Two judges have dismissed those claims of a witch hunt,\" she said at a press conference in Manhattan. \"So I give no credence to the names that he has referred to me.\"\nShe also mocked Mr Trump's 1987 best-selling self-help book as she described his alleged fraud.\n\"Claiming that you have money that you do not have, does not amount to the 'Art of the deal'. It's the art of the steal,\" she said.\nThe lawsuit came after Mr Trump unsuccessfully sued to block her probe, and over three years after her inquiry began.\nAt a four-hour legal deposition in August 2022, Mr Trump declined to answer hundreds of her questions, pleading his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\nEarlier in the case, Ms James had a judge fine Mr Trump $10,000 (\u00a38,900) for each day that he refused to turn over documents related to the civil investigation.\nMr Trump has argued that her previous comments, including when she referred to him as an \"illegitimate president\" during her run for attorney general, prove that has a political vendetta against him.\nComments she made at a debate in 2018 pledging to \"focus on Donald Trump\" and \"follow his money\" have also led Mr Trump's lawyers to claim political bias."

      "text": "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has appointed a \"special attorney\" to probe mortgage fraud allegations against Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two administration officials told NBC News.\nThe Justice Department is also in the initial stages of an investigation of James over her successful civil fraud case against President Donald Trump, according to three people familiar with the matter.\nBondi tapped Ed Martin, a conservative activist and former interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., as special attorney to investigate Schiff and James, both prominent Democratic opponents of the president, the two administration officials said.\nA senior law enforcement official said a grand jury seated in the Eastern District of Virginia will investigate the James mortgage fraud allegations and a grand jury in Maryland will investigate the allegations against Schiff.\nMartin met Friday morning with Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who sent a criminal referral on the California senator to the Justice Department in May, the administration officials said. Pulte sent a referral on James in April, prompting the Justice Department to open an investigation on allegations that she made false statements on mortgage loan applications.\nSchiff and James have denied any wrongdoing.\nTrump had previously called for both Democratic officials to be prosecuted because of the mortgage fraud allegations. Schiff and James have denied wrongdoing.\nSchiff blasted Trump's claims in a video statement in July. \"This is the kind of stuff you see tinpot dictators do. It is designed to intimidate his political opponents and somehow try to silence them,\" he said then.\nThe U.S. attorney probe of James is focused on whether her office used its authority to violate Trump's legal rights through its civil lawsuits against the president and his businesses, according to three people familiar with the matter.\nThat investigation is also looking at whether the National Rifle Association's rights were violated by her civil suits, the three sources said. It is being run out of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of New York, two of those sources said.\nIn response to an NBC News inquiry, a spokesperson for the attorney general\u2019s office said: \u201cAny weaponization of the justice system should disturb every American. We stand strongly behind our successful litigation against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, and we will continue to stand up for New Yorkers\u2019 rights.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office did not return a request for comment.\nJames, a Democrat, successfully sued Trump and his company over what her office said were fraudulent misrepresentations of his wealth and financial statements. A judge awarded James\u2019 office over $300 million in the case, an amount that's since swelled to over $500 million with interest. Trump is appealing the judgment.\nJames' office also sued the NRA and its leadership with mixed results. The attorney general had sought the dissolution of the NRA in what is commonly referred to as the corporate \u201cdeath penalty,\u201d but a judge struck down those claims.\nIn 2024, James' office did win its civil fraud case against the longtime head of the NRA, Wayne LaPierre, with a jury convicting him of diverting millions of dollars from the gun group for his own personal lifestyle.\nIt is not immediately clear how far along the DOJ investigation into James' office is and what evidence, if any, the Justice Department has gathered in the probe.\nAn attorney for James, Abbe Lowell, said the probe of James' fraud case against Trump and his businesses \u201chas to be the most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president\u2019s political retribution campaign.\"\n\"Weaponizing the Department of Justice to try to punish an elected official for doing her job is an attack on the rule of law and a dangerous escalation by this administration,\" he added.\nThe FBI and Justice Department began its probe of the mortgage fraud allegations against James in the spring. It's unclear why Martin is now in charge of the review.\nMartin served as Trump's interim U.S. attorney for Washngton, D.C., earlier this year, but his nomination was withdrawn after Republican senators expressed concerns over his association with Jan. 6 rioters. Trump then announced in May that Martin was moving to the Justice Department to serve as director of a \u201cweaponization working group.\"\nMartin did not comment on the Friday appointment.\nLowell pushed back on the allegations against James in an April letter to Bondi, acknowledging there were some mistaken forms while noting contemporaneous letters and forms showing that James submitted the correct information.\nThe letter called the \"threadbare allegations\" the \"next salvo in President Trump\u2019s revenge tour against Attorney General James.\"\nIn addition to her fraud case against Trump and his companies, James and her office have launched a number of successful legal challenges to his administration's agenda, dating back to his first term in office.\nTrump has maintained that James is biased against him. In 2021, he sued to stop her from proceeding with her fraud investigation, saying, \u201cHer mission is guided solely by political animus and a desire to harass, intimidate, and retaliate against a private citizen who she views as a political opponent.\" The lawsuit also alleged that Trump was the victim of \"viewpoint discrimination.\"\nTrump later dropped the suit, but has continued to criticize James, including in an April Truth Social post that called her a \"wacky\" and \"totally corrupt politician\" who should immediately resign."

      "text": "Shortly after her election in November, New York Attorney General Letitia James vowed to \"use every area of the law\" to probe President Donald Trump, his family and associates, and his business.\nAs the chief legal officer in a state with that provides her with sweeping investigatory and prosecutorial powers, she can keep that promise.\nWith special counsel Robert Mueller's probe now complete, others' investigations, including the New York attorney general's, are continuing.\nJames recently subpoenaed Trump's banks, seeking information about the Trump Organization and the president's finances. Though Trump has dismissed these efforts as \"presidential harassment\" and tweeted that James, a Democrat, \"openly campaigned on a GET TRUMP agenda,\" several former New York attorneys general and legal experts say the president could have plenty to fear.\n\"There's broad power \u2014 there's no question,\" Oliver Koppell, a Democrat who served as New York attorney general in 1994, told NBC News of the substantial authority and tools the office has to investigate and prosecute businesses for fraud.\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment.\nNew York law allows the attorney general to seek restitution and damages \u2014 and, in extreme cases, dissolution \u2014 if a business is found to have engaged in persistent fraud. There's also the Martin Act, a 1921 statute designed to protect investors.\nPast attorneys general have used the Martin Act, considered to be the U.S.'s toughest such state statute in this realm, to expand their powers in the financial crimes sector. The law empowers the attorney general to subpoena witnesses and documents for information pertaining to possible fraud.\n\"The Martin Act gives really broad powers,\" said Dennis Vacco, a Republican who served as New York attorney general from 1995 to 1998. (Vacco declined to comment on whether Trump or associates have sought his legal counsel regarding this investigation.)\nVacco said the Martin Act is one of few in the nation that provides the attorney general with criminal investigative authority without having to first receive a referral from the governor or a state agency and he noted that a criminal prosecution often will start off as a civil investigation, which is what the Trump Organization is currently facing.\nThe statute \"really does apply to almost any financial transaction in New York state,\" he said.\nKoppell said that it was former Democratic New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who served from 1999 to 2006, who wrote the modern playbook that James could follow. Spitzer \"really kind of expanded the scope of attorney general work in the area of financial fraud,\" Koppell said.\nSpitzer, who later was elected governor only to resign amid a prostitution scandal in 2008, aggressively pursued white-collar crimes like securities fraud and used statutes such as the Martin Act to pursue prosecutions that had been typically left for federal authorities.\nSpitzer's investigation of American International Group and its then-CEO Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg, for example, may have parallels to James' latest lines of inquiry into Trump's businesses. The then-attorney general alleged that the insurance giant's top executives engaged in fraudulent business practices. Those executives settled with the state in 2017, agreeing to forfeit about $10 million in performance bonuses, a fraction of what New York sought.\nThrough a spokesperson, Spitzer declined to comment to NBC News.\nCould James dissolve the Trump Org?\nIt's rare for the attorney general to seek the dissolution of a business, but it has happened. In 1994, the state closed down an education company that repeatedly failed to comply with student loan regulations.\nIn \"People by Abrams v. Oliver School,\" a New York appellate court affirmed the dissolution and said the power was typically used \"as a remedy for persistent consumer fraud.\"\nThe power has been described by the state Supreme Court as a \"judgment of corporate death,\" with the offending company's transgressions needing to be so serious \"as to harm or menace the public welfare\" in order for it to be an appropriate remedy.\nThe public first became aware of James' new inquiry into Trump and his business after she recently subpoenaed Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records regarding some of Trump's business dealings and his failed 2014 effort to buy the NFL's Buffalo Bills. Like her office's ongoing probe into the Trump Foundation, which led to the dissolution of the president's charity, the latest inquiry into Trump's business dealings is a civil investigation.\nJames opened the probe after Michael Cohen, the president's former attorney, testified to Congress last month that Trump inflated the worth of his assets in financial statements that he provided to banks to secure loans. A source familiar with James' investigation told NBC News the probe appears to be moving quickly.\nSpeaking with MSNBC's Ali Velshi on Friday, James said she could not provide a status update on the latest investigation but did say she has standing to probe Trump because \"most of his business activities are performed in New York, he engages in business in New York, he operates in New York and it's really critically important that New Yorkers as taxpayers \u2014 it's really critically important that we understand and know whether or not he devalued his corporations and he received some tax benefits thereof, that he engaged in false claims against New Yorkers.\"\n\"And as a result of that we are seeking to see what we can do legally,\" she continued. \"But until such time as we review all of the information and all of the information that we are seeking, that is all I can say at this point in time.\"\nIt is not yet clear what the scope or focus of James' new probe is, but former New York attorneys general told NBC News that she could use her office's sweeping powers as part of an investigation into whether Trump had defrauded consumers, which is when those powers are typically used, or financial institutions.\n\"The DNA of the conduct is the same, whether it's defrauding a financial institution or defrauding investors or consumers,\" Vacco said, adding that he was not vouching for the basis of James' investigation. \"Because, at the end of the day, it's still fraud.\"\n\"In this instance, it's a legitimate business (banks that loaned to Trump) that is being defrauded,\" former New York Attorney General Robert Abrams, a Democrat who served from 1979 to 1993, told NBC News. \"Decisions are being made against fraudulent information.\"\n\"There's a wide variety of roles and opportunities for enforcement of the law and protection for those who are being victimized by false representations, misleading statements, advertising information provided in the application process, whatever,\" added Abrams, who said he went after businesses for fraud \"virtually every day and every week.\"\nJed Shugerman, a Fordham University law professor who advised Democrat Zephyr Teachout in her 2018 attorney general campaign, told NBC News that no matter what legal authority James is using to back her latest inquiry, she must be speedy. Shugerman said it would be unfortunate for the results of the probe to come to light close to the 2020 election, which could give critics of the investigation ammunition to attack it as partisan.\n\"Now we have this delicate balance of being able to move fast enough so that they can get evidence with civil subpoenas and civil process of discovery, but not so aggressively that they look to be moving politically with potentially abusing their power,\" he said.\nNonetheless, the probe itself poses danger to Trump because of James' broad powers, according to NBC News/MSNBC legal analyst Glenn Kirschner.\nKirschner, a former federal prosecutor, said if the documents James is seeking show that Trump misled banks about his assets, proving fraud \"should be like shooting fish in a barrel for the New York AG.\""

      "text": "A New York judge on Monday temporarily banned Wayne LaPierre from returning to lead the National Rifle Association but said he would not appoint an independent monitor to oversee the gun rights group.\nState Supreme Court Judge Joel Cohen denied one of the most significant remedies proposed by New York Attorney General Letitia James after a jury found the NRA and its executives liable in a civil corruption trial.\nIn February, jurors determined that LaPierre, 74, had diverted millions of dollars from the NRA to live luxuriously, while the organization failed to properly manage its finances and adopt a whistleblower policy.\nCohen has spent the last two weeks weighing whether to award nonmonetary relief in the second phase of the civil trial.\nJames sought to permanently bar LaPierre from returning to the lead the NRA or its affiliates. Cohen issued a 10-year ban instead.\nThe attorney general also wanted the judge to appoint an independent monitor who would oversee the NRA's finances and report to the court for three years.\nCohen declined to do so, but he directed the attorney general's office and the NRA to propose other reforms the NRA could enact, such as retaining a compliance consultant, changing the internal audit committee, or reducing the size of the board.\n\u201cThe damages portion of the case we presented, as well as the earlier trial before the jury, demonstrated that the NRA had a stunning lack of accountability and its leaders engaged in illegality and self-dealing,\" James said in a statement. \"After years of corruption, the NRA and its senior leaders are finally being held accountable.\u201d\nLaPierre served as the NRA\u2019s CEO and executive vice president for more than 30 years before he announced his resignation at the beginning of January, days before the start of the trial, citing health issues.\nJurors still found there was cause for his removal from the NRA. They determined he had violated his statutory obligation to discharge the duties of his position in good faith, as did John Frazer, the group\u2019s corporate secretary and former general counsel, and Wilson \u201cWoody\u201d Phillips, the NRA\u2019s former treasurer and chief financial officer.\nThe jury said that LaPierre had caused $5.4 million in monetary harm to the NRA, but that he has already repaid at least $1 million of that. Phillips caused $2 million in monetary harm to the NRA, the jurors found, while Frazer did not cause any monetary harm to the group.\nOn Monday, Cohen declined to impose restrictions on Frazer.\nBefore the second phase of the trial began, the parties reached a stipulation agreement on the appropriate remedy for Phillips.\nPhillips, who is retired, will be prohibited from holding fiduciary positions with any New York nonprofit for 10 years. After a decade, he can resume serving if he first notifies the attorney general\u2019s office and completes a training program.\nHe will still have to pay $2 million in damages, the attorney general said.\nDuring oral arguments in June, LaPierre\u2019s attorney, P. Kent Correll, argued against banning LaPierre from working for the NRA or its affiliates.\nCorrell said that LaPierre was retired and \u201cnot coming back\u201d to the NRA but that LaPierre wants to \u201ckeep his right to associate freely with whomever he wants and to speak freely.\u201d\nAttorneys for the NRA, LaPierre and Frazer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe NRA had fought against the independent monitor, saying the attorney general could not show that the NRA had continued violating any laws.\nThe group said it had fired those who took advantage of it and ushered in a fresh slate of leaders, including a new chief compliance officer, an internal auditor and a president.\nIn May, the organization replaced Frazer as general counsel, although he was re-elected to serve as corporate secretary, the NRA said.\nThe NRA has operated as a nonprofit charitable corporation in New York since 1871. Its assets are required by law to be used in a way that serves the interests of its membership and advances its charitable mission.\nNRA membership dues and contributions have drastically fallen in the last few years, court records show.\nDues dropped from about $170 million in 2018 to nearly $62 million in 2023, according to a court exhibit that contains the NRA\u2019s audited financial statements. Contributions were nearly cut in half in that period."
