      "feedback": "Strong start, but to reach world‑class level the piece needs a clean, regime‑based, first‑principles framework that makes the multi‑year logic explicit and testable. Actionable edits: 1) Anchor the horizon with invariant assets and channels: productivity/TFP gains from AI, persistent labor‑market frictions, and policy reaction functions (i.e., retraining vs. blanket supports vs. UBI), plus macro price‑level and external‑balance implications. Explicitly state regimes and transition conditions (e.g., Regime A: AI‑driven productivity with contained displacement; Regime B: policy pivot toward retraining/targeted supports; Regime C: broad UBI with attendant labor‑incentive risks), then tie each regime to market pricing via discount rates, wage paths, and earnings power. 2) Map causality and transmission with crisp, source‑backed anchors: automation exposure ~25% of US jobs with high disruption risk (NL5YYTLF2) and Finland’s UBI trials showing limited employment impact (NL5YYTLF2); Ford’s EV transition as a concrete corporate transmission example—Q2 EV losses of about $1.3B with EV segment margins reflecting 4.3% operating margin and 10.1% ROIC (22PL3Q360), plus Ford’s ~5.18% dividend yield and roughly 8–10x forward multiple (22PL3Q360); contrast with broader market dynamics and retail‑investor behavior that have priced Ford as a high‑yield income stock rather than a growth engine (W2622L6WW). 3) Strengthen the base case with a concise narrative and explicit watchpoints, not a single macro‑story: use the cited signals to describe a path where AI productivity supports trend growth, but real earnings upside varies across sectors, with policy and EV profitability as drag or tailwinds; add watch items such as AI adoption pace, EV program profitability, tariff/policy developments, and wage growth signals; 4) Integrate the behavioral and identity channels from the “two rules from mom”/UBI critiques (2QRLB974F) and the retirement/expense literature (YVQU6QCY4; 16) to ground household balance sheets and consumption during transitions; quantify where possible (e.g., 25% automation exposure; 17% YTD Ford rise; 4.3% margin; 10.1% ROIC; 5.18% dividend) and keep all numeric references tied to the IDs; 5) Add explicit catalysts and invalidation tests: AI breakthroughs, retraining program efficacy, UBI policy shifts, and EV profitability turning positive as key catalysts; invalidation criteria include a material policy pivot toward broad UBI with demonstrably large employment gains or a sustained inflation/supply‑shock that disrupts the AI/EV narratives; 6) Reconcile conflicts and ensure coverage of critical sources: cite NL5YYTLF2 for automation/UBI debates, 22PL3Q360 and W2622L6WW for Ford specifics and equity pricing, 2QRLB974F for consumer/identity/priority rules, and YVQU6QCY4 for retirement planning and expenses, ensuring every claim ties to a source; 7) Improve structure and clarity within one compact but scorable narrative by stating the base case first, then the three regime paths and their triggers, followed by the price/risks/what to watch and a concise confidence assessment (with sources in parentheses after each assertion). This will sharpen the causal chain, increase numerical discipline, and better satisfy the multi‑year, first‑principles focus.",
