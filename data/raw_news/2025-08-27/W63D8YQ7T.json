  "title": "Fox host: There\u2019s a \u2018modicum of peace\u2019 that dead kids are with Jesus after shooting",
  "description": "\u2018The only thing that can give us any modicum of peace at all is that those two children are with the person who loved them the very most, the person who created them, that being Jesus,\u2019 Trey Gowdy said on Wednesday",
  "content": "Fox News host Trey Gowdy reacted on Wednesday to the breaking news that two children had been killed in a mass shooting at a Minnesota church by stating that \u201cthe only thing that can give us any modicum of peace at all\u201d is that the victims were with Jesus Christ now.\n\nAccording to law enforcement officials, a gunman opened fire during mass at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis on Wednesday morning, shooting through the church windows while schoolchildren prayed.\n\nTwo children, aged 8 and 10, were killed in the shooting while 17 others \u2013 including 14 children \u2013 were injured. According to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara, the gunman \u2013 who was armed with a rifle, shotgun and pistol \u2013 died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The suspect, whom O\u2019Hara said was in his early 20s, \u201cdoes not have an extensive known criminal history.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shooter approached on one side of the church building, and on that side, at least two doors, it appears there had been a two-by-four placed,\u201d O\u2019Hara added. \u201cSo not all of the doors around the building, but on the side the shooter did fire.\u201d\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of Fox News panel show Outnumbered, Gowdy \u2013 a former prosecutor and Republican congressman \u2013 was asked to weigh in on the massacre based on his \u201cvast experience\u201d as a lawmaker and assistant United States attorney.\n\n\u201cIt is the softest of all targets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe church literally rolls out the welcome mat for troubled people. It\u2019s the place for troubled people to go. So it is the softest of all targets and the most innocent of all victims \u2013 children.\u201d\n\nStating that \u201ceven those that survived will be impacted for the remainder of their lives,\u201d Gowdy added that there \u201care no words for the parents whose children were killed.\u201d At the same time, he reiterated that \u201cwe do have to have a conversation about protecting soft targets,\u201d specifically churches and schools.\n\n\u201cLiterally, the whole purpose of the church is to welcome people who are down and out, who are depressed, who feel ostracized,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the purpose of church. Having said that, there are no words.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Gowdy insisted that the only thing that could spell relief for the grieving parents was that their children were now up in heaven with their lord and savior.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that can give us any modicum of peace at all is that those two children are with the person who loved them the very most, the person who created them, that being Jesus,\u201d he declared. \u201cThat is the only thing that can possibly give parents in the future any modicum of peace. Those children are literally with the person who loved them the very most.\u201d\n\nWrapping up his thoughts, Gowdy stated that he was \u201cglad the shooter is dead\u201d but wished that \u201che had taken his life before he took the lives of innocent children.\u201d\n\nGowdy\u2019s on-air remarks were met with furious backlash from progressives and liberals, who blasted the Fox News star for what they felt was a tone-deaf approach to the tragedy.\n\n\u201cI know a ton of people who are very serious about their faith. I guess Trey Gowdy [is] trying to do some version of it\u2019s in Gods hands,\u201d Rolling Stone senior reporter Asawin Suebsang posted on Bluesky. \u201cI would never think to say this to any devout friend or family member who had just had a kid murdered.\u201d\n\nFormer Jezebel editor-in-chief Laura Bassett, meanwhile, was far more succinct with her reaction to Gowdy\u2019s comments. \u201cWhat the F***,\u201d she wrote, adding: \u201cIf a man said that to me after my child was murdered with a gun I would strangle him to death on the spot.\u201d\n\nPerhaps ironically, Gowdy also took heat from many conservatives online over comments he made a few moments later during Outnumbered\u2019s coverage of the shooting.\n\n\u201cWe're going to have a conversation of freedom versus protecting children,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cHow many school shootings does it take before we\u2019re going to have a conversation about keeping firearms out of \u2013 it\u2019s always a young white male. Almost always. I mean, did anyone this morning think, I wonder if that was a female? Did any of y\u2019all think that?!\u201d\n\nGowdy\u2019s observation about mass shooters prompted several right-wing accounts on X to call for Fox News to \u201cfire him now\u201d while demanding that the ex-GOP lawmaker quickly \u201cissue an apology.\u201d",

      "text": "Terror at Minneapolis church: Shooter dead after killing two children as they prayed during Mass at Christian school\nThe shooter is dead, but has not been named.\nA gunman opened fire at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis Wednesday morning, killing two children and leaving 17 others injured.\nA shooter, standing outside the south Minneapolis church, fired \u201cdozens\u201d of rounds from a rifle through the church windows at the children sitting in the pews during Mass, a worship service marking the first week of school, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara said at a press conference.\nTwo children, aged 8 and 10, were killed in the church pews, while 17 others were injured. Fourteen of those injured were children, two of whom are in critical condition, he said.\n\u201cThis was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping,\u201d the police chief said.\nThe shooter, who has not yet been named, died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, he said.\nHere is everything we know about the incident and the shooter:\nWhat happened?\nAround 8:30 a.m., a gunman approached the outside of the church and fired a rifle through its windows toward the children and worshippers sitting in the pews, O\u2019Hara said.\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear if he ever went inside the building, as no shell casings have been found inside the church, he said.\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many shots were fired, O\u2019Hara estimated that number to be \u201cin the dozens.\u201d\nEmergency personnel provided first aid to victims and began rescuing some children that were hiding in the building. Many were rushed to nearby hospitals.\nBy 9.30 a.m., authorities said the shooter was \u201ccontained,\u201d noting there was \u201cno active threat to the community.\u201d\nO\u2019Hara called the attack an \u201cunspeakable tragedy.\u201d\n\u201cThe sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible,\u201d the police chief said.\nWho was the shooter?\nPolice have not identified the shooter, but said he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene.\nHe was in his 20s, wearing a black clothing and \u201ccargo-type pants,\u201d O\u2019Hara said.\nHe was armed with a rifle, shotgun, and a pistol.\nThe shooter doesn\u2019t have an extensive known criminal history, the police chief said.\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear whether he was a former student or otherwise associated with the school.\nWho are the victims?\nAn 8-year-old and 10-year-old were tragically killed in the attack. Their identities have not been made public.\nSeventeen other people \u2014 including 14 children \u2014 were injured in the shooting, O\u2019Hara said. Two of the children are in critical condition.\nMonday marked the first day of the school year, according to social media posts from the school.\n\u201cThese kids were literally praying. It was the first week of school. They were in a church,\u201d Mayor Jacob Frey said at a press conference. \u201cThey should be able to go to school or church in peace without the fear or risk of violence and their parents should have the same kind of assurance.\u201d\nThe Catholic school, based in southern Minneapolis, teaches students from preschool through eighth grade. The school touts itself as \u201can inspiring environment that nurtures excellence, creativity and faith.\u201d\nThe school has set up a reunification zone at the school.\nWhat has the reaction been?\nLocal and federal officials denounced the shooting as a \u201chorrific act of violence.\u201d\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz said in a social media post: \u201cI\u2019m praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence.\u201d\nFrey called it an \u201cact of evil\u201d that should never haappen.\nTrump said he\u2019s been briefed on the shooting. \u201cThe White House will continue to monitor this terrible situation. Please join me in praying for everyone involved!\u201d\nMinnesota Senator Tina Smith commended law enforcement\u2019s swift response before condemning the violent act. \u201cIt\u2019s the first week of school. These kids should not be fearing for their lives,\u201d she wrote on X.\nFellow Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar said she was \u201cheartbroken by the horrific violence\u201d at the school. She wrote on X: \u201cMy prayers are with the students, teachers, and families, and I am grateful for the first responders who are on the scene.\u201d"

      "text": "Advocates fear gun control agenda will divert Obama from immigration reform\nPresident Barack Obama's pledge to pursue a package of gun control measures next month has immigration advocates concerned whether the effort could delay or distract the White House from moving quickly to fulfill another of his second-term priorities.\nLatino leaders, disappointed by Obama's inability to achieve comprehensive immigration reform in his first term, say they understand and support the urgency of Obama's push to reduce gun violence in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., shooting rampage.\nBut they said they expect him to make good on his promise to \"seize the moment\" on immigration in the wake of an election in which Hispanic voters overwhelmingly supported him and other Democrats. Republicans, stung by the losses, have suggested they are open to new immigration reforms as they seek to broaden their own base of support.\n\"There is clear momentum for it, so it's really important to get to it immediately because it will not happen overnight,\" said Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, which spent millions recruiting new Hispanic voters this year. \"Our belief is that 2013 is the window of opportunity. We'd like to see it happen in the first part of year, whether it's three months or six months, but in order to start the clock running we have to start quickly.\"\nMedina and other advocates said the White House told them to be ready as early as next month to help lobby Congress and rally the public over reforms that could help provide a path to citizenship for the nation's 11 million undocumented workers. Obama, who won 71 percent of the Latino vote, said during his first news conference after winning reelection that he expected to have a comprehensive legislative bill introduced in Congress \"very soon after my inauguration\" on Jan. 20.\nBut that was before a gunman killed 26 people, including 20 children, at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14, prompting Obama to declare that he will use all the powers of his office to reduce gun violence. Last week, the president appointed Vice President Joe Biden to head a commission to develop new proposals that Obama will \"push without delay\" in January.\nAdding further complications to the timetable over the White House's immigration strategy is the deadlocked negotiations over the looming \"fiscal cliff\" that could drag into the new year. Asked last week about Obama's increasingly bloated agenda, White House press secretary Jay Carney declined to rank priorities.\n\"We need to do all of it,\" Carney said. \"And this president is committed to just that.\"\nImmigration advocates say they intend to keep the pressure on. Last week, Latino leaders announced they will keep a scorecard on lawmakers over immigration and mobilize voters in the 2014 election against those who score poorly.\nThe advocates said they are encouraged that Senate Republicans, led by Marco Rubio, Fla., and John McCain, Ariz., have had private discussions about their immigration strategy in recent weeks.\nBut in the House, where Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said last month the time is right to pursue immigration reform, the GOP named Rep. Trey Gowdy, S.C., viewed as a hardliner on immigration, as chairman of the immigration subcommittee. Another hardliner, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, Va., was named chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which oversees immigration. Both have been skeptical of immigration proposals such as the Dream Act.\n\"As we line up a path to gun control and the response to Connecticut, everybody expects Congress, just like the rest of the American people, will be able to take on more than one thing,\" said Clarissa Martinez de Castro, director of civic engagement and immigration for the National Council of La Raza. \"There is a real premium for Republicans moving forward on immigration. It's less about their position with Democrats than with making inroads with a section of the electorate that they will not see the inside of the White House without. That's their biggest motivation.\"\nRep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., was so frustrated with the Obama administration's record of deporting more than 1 million undocumented immigrants that he was arrested after staging a protest outside the White House gates in July 2011.\nGutierrez also has been active in attempts to push stronger gun control measures. He said he hopes that on both issues, growing public pressure will help break long-standing inaction on Capitol Hill.\n\"Would I like the White House to be more public and demonstrative about what they're doing on immigration? Sure,\" Guiterrez said. \"Do I believe in the end they will be in the forefront of the fight, spearheading the fight? Yes. Might we have to wait a little longer and be patient as the White House grapples with so many different issues? Yes, but in the end I have every expectation I will be standing next to the president on this.\"\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "Two children dead and 17 others hurt after shooting at Minneapolis Catholic school: Latest updates\nShooting began shortly before 8:30 a.m. at Catholic school church in South Minneapolis\nA shooter opened fire at a church on the south side of Minneapolis on Wednesday morning as school children were celebrating Mass at the start of the academic year.\nPolice and paramedics responded to Annunciation Church, located at 509 W. 54th Street, which is adjacent to a Catholic school.\nAuthorities have confirmed that two children were killed and 17 others were injured, 14 of them children, two of whom are in critical condition.\nA witness from inside the church said the shooter \u201cpepper-sprayed through the stained-glass windows into the building, 50 to 100 shots.\u201d\nThe shooter was described as a man in his early twenties, dressed all in black and armed with a rifle, a shotgun, and a pistol. No motive is known at this time, and he took his own life.\nPresident Donald Trump has offered condolences to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.\nA distraught Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey rejected offers of \u201cthoughts and prayers,\u201d saying at a press conference: \u201cChildren are dead, there are families that have a deceased child. You cannot put into words the gravity, tragedy or absolute pain of the situation.\u201d\nNeighbor says gunfire went on for three or four minutes\nBill Bienemann, who lives nearby, told KARE 11 that his daughter went to Annunciation School for nine years.\nHe lives two blocks away from the scene and was shocked when he heard a volley of gunfire that went on for what he estimated was three or four minutes.\n\u201cI said, there's no way that that could be gunfire. There was so much of it. So, it was sporadic... it was a semi-automatic, and seemed like a rifle. It certainly didn't sound like a handgun, and so he must have reloaded, you know, several times for sure.\u201d\nBienemann believes he heard between 30 and 50 shots fired.\nTrump has spoken with Gov. Walz\nPresident Donald Trump has spoken with Gov. Tim Walz about the shooting in Minnesota.\nA source familiar with the phone call told Libbey Dean of NewsNation: \u201cGovernor Walz spoke with President Trump following the horrific shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis. President Trump called to offer his condolences to the people of Minnesota and Governor Walz thanked him for the support.\u201d\nAll shots came from outside church\nPolice chief Brian O\u2019Hara told reporters that the suspect is believed to have fired all three weapons: a rifle, a shotgun, and a pistol.\nHe said it appears all or most of the shooting was done from outside. Police found no casings inside.\nAuthorities also found a smoke bomb but no explosives at the scene.\nTwo children in critical condition\nTwo young children, ages eight and 10, were killed as they sat in the pews. Their parents have been notified, Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara says.\n17 other people were injured. 14 of them are children, and two of those children are in critical condition.\nShooter took his own life\n\u201cThe coward who fired these shots ultimately took his own life in the rear of the church,\u201d says Chief Brian O'Hara.\nHe is believed to be in his early twenties, and a motive for the attack is not yet known.\nShooter had rifle, shotgun and pistol\nPolice Chief Brian O\u2019Hara says the gunman was armed with a rifle, a shotgun, and a pistol, and it was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children.\nState senator 'devastated' for community\nState Senator Zaynab Mohamed, who represents the area, said: \u201cOur beautiful Southside was struck with horrifying gun violence this morning at Annunciation Catholic School.\n\u201cGrateful for the response by law enforcement and EMTs providing care to those in need.\n\u201cI am absolutely devastated for our community.\u201d\nIn a further statement, she said: \u201cMy heart is with the parishioners of the church and the Annunciation students and their families. I know some of them personally and will make myself available to all of them to support them in any way possible.\u201d\nMohamed called the shooting \u201canother tragedy in what has already been a painful period for our state and community.\u201d\n\u201cWe must all condemn gun violence,\" she said, \u201cand come together to work on real solutions to prevent future tragedy.\u201d\nRecap: Three dead, 20 injured in shooting at Minneapolis Catholic school, authorities say\nThree people were killed and 20 were injured in a shooting at a Catholic school in the south end of Minneapolis on Wednesday, a U.S. Justice Department official said. The shooter was among those killed, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.\nThe shooting happened two days after the new school year started at Annunciation Catholic School, a private elementary school with about 395 students. The school is connected to Annunciation Catholic Church, both of which are situated in a residential area in the southeastern part of Minnesota's largest city.\nPolice in Richfield, a nearby suburb, reported that a man dressed entirely in black with a rifle was seen at the scene.\nLocal media reported that children were attending a morning mass when the shooting began. Local TV showed parents ducking under yellow police crime tape and guiding students out of the school.\nAccording to police, there have been three other shootings in the Midwestern city since Tuesday afternoon, which have collectively resulted in three deaths and seven injuries."

Fox News host Trey Gowdy reacted by saying the only solace is that the children are now with Jesus, a statement that drew criticism for being tone\u2011deaf. The shooter, in his early 20s and armed with a rifle, shotgun and pistol, had no extensive criminal record. Local officials, the mayor, Governor Tim Walz and President Trump all expressed condolences and called for action on gun violence, while the incident sparked debate over protecting soft targets such as churches and schools.",
