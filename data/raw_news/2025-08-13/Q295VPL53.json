  "content": "Mark Twain once remarked that there are \u201clies, damned lies, and statistics.\u201d A century later, the line still gets a chuckle. Not because statistics are inherently dishonest, but because we all recognize their power.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nData has always shaped how people understand the world and decide what to do next. For most of history, the limitation wasn\u2019t whether data had value, but whether it could be gathered, processed and applied quickly enough to matter.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that the best way to brief an executive was to drop a giant blue book crammed with pages and pages of data onto their desk and hope they had the stamina and enough caffeine to find the relevant insights.\n\nMerchants tracked sales and debts using paper ledgers. Governments conducted censuses walking door to door. Economists took weeks to pore over quarterly reports. The Fed\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finance was conducted every three years. By the time the numbers arrived two years later, the conditions they described were already shifting.\n\nAdvances in computing power, the drop in storage costs and the rise of the cloud have helped speed things up. Suddenly, vast amounts of data could be captured, stored and analyzed in near-real time. Data suddenly became a powerful, underutilized resource that could fuel innovation and competitive advantage in a more relevant timeframe for decision-making.\n\nThat turned timely data into a form of currency. Something companies could exchange for value.\n\nBut like any currency, data\u2019s value depends on trust. In today\u2019s economy, that trust is being tested, challenging how data is collected, interpreted and used.\n\nHighly valuable data, like that collected by Google, Amazon, Meta and other tech giants, is built on trust and scale. These companies have access to vast amounts of data generated by billions of users every day, collected through search activity, browsing behavior, purchasing patterns and even location tracking. The scale and richness of this data provides unique insights into consumer behavior, preferences and trends in real time. It powers their algorithms, which help them get more users and even more data.\n\nThe real value of this data lies not just in its quantity but in its accuracy, timeliness and reliability. Google and Amazon, for example, use data in real time from search queries and purchases to shape everything from targeted advertising to product recommendations, creating a feedback loop that drives innovation and fuels billions more in sales. When properly managed and analyzed, this data allows businesses to personalize experiences, predict trends and improve how they operate using a data-driven foundation.\n\nThen there\u2019s the data that is unreliable, often due to fraud. Whether through manipulated transactions, misleading advertising metrics or fake reviews, fraudulent data can severely distort business decision-making. Without the promise of data integrity, decision-making becomes a gamble rather than a solid strategic foundation. In today\u2019s AI-bot intensive world, the prevalence of fake data can make it difficult for businesses to tell the difference between what\u2019s real and the picture of reality that the bad bots paint.\n\nGetting to the \u2018Why\u2019 Behind the \u2018What\u2019\n\nTransactional data tells you what happened. A purchase, a click, a payment. But without the \u201cwhy,\u201d it\u2019s just a headline without the story.\n\nA sudden drop in sales could be because of a competitor\u2019s promotion, a supplier shortage or shifting consumer priorities. A spike in cross-border transactions might reflect new merchant acceptance and expansion, currency swings or more consumer and business travel. Freight delays could be regulatory, logistical or demand-driven. Without proper context, you\u2019re left guessing.\n\nQualitative data fills the gap. It reveals motivations, preferences, and emotional drivers. It helps predict future behavior, guide product strategy and spot trends before they hit the radar. It\u2019s what turns raw signals into the insights that form sound strategy.\n\nGovernment statistics have their place, but they trail reality. That matters when markets are volatile or accurate data are needed right now. Employment figures, GDP reports, and trade stats offer historical snapshots, often revised later. Even trendlines from decades of Bureau of Labor Statistics data can lag behind today\u2019s dynamics, where monetary policy shifts overnight. That\u2019s why fast signals must be paired with the context and process to make them relevant.\n\nWhen quantitative data confirms something is happening and qualitative data explains why, you get the full picture.\n\nWhen Trust is Broken: Lessons From Argentina and Enron\n\nIn 2007, Argentina\u2019s government removed Graciela Bevacqua, head of the national statistics agency, after she refused to alter inflation figures. As The Wall Street Journal recently reported, her replacement changed the way the Consumer Price Index was calculated. Official figures showed inflation at 8.5%. Independent economists put it closer to 25%. The manipulation saved the government billions in inflation-linked payouts but drew sharp rebuke from the IMF and caused citizens and businesses to turn to unofficial data sources. Even after a later administration restored transparency, it took years for credibility in government data to be restored.\n\nIn the corporate world, Enron\u2019s collapse in 2001 resulted in the same erosion of trust. Using \u201cmark-to-market\u201d accounting, Enron booked future projected profits as if they were already realized and hid debt in off-balance-sheet entities. The company\u2019s financial statements presented a picture of stability even as the underlying business was crumbling.\n\nWhen the facts were surfaced, Enron filed for bankruptcy, investors lost billions and employees lost jobs and pensions. Enron\u2019s collapse prompted Congress to pass the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to mandate tougher audits, CEO/CFO certifications, and stronger internal controls to restore investor trust. It was a lesson that you couldn\u2019t always trust company data. About 20 years later, Wirecard is a reminder that even with audits from a big-four firm (E&Y in this case) bad data can still snooker investors.\n\nThe Science and the Art of Great Data\n\nBig data isn\u2019t the same as good data. Gathering and analyzing millions of data points doesn\u2019t guarantee that you have the right ones. Or that you understand what they\u2019re telling you. In fast-changing markets, credibility starts with the science of collection, because if the foundation is flawed, the insights will be too.\n\nThat means asking the right questions without bias and designing survey instruments that do not \u201clead the witness.\u201d Building samples that are representative of the population you want to understand, not the easiest group to reach. Verifying respondents are real and answering truthfully, something that\u2019s becoming increasingly tough in the age of AI bots as respondents. Collecting data in a consistent, transparent way to protect respondents\u2019 privacy and the integrity of the research project. And checking findings against reputable sources before publishing.\n\nThe art is turning those numbers into business insights. Outliers can be early warnings or mistakes, but without context it\u2019s hard to know. Patterns that look obvious may hide deeper causes. Context transforms data into compelling, data-driven calls to action.\n\nI asked GPT-5 what makes data credible. Its answer: transparency, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, objectivity, reproducibility, ethical safeguards, provenance tracking, honest acknowledgment of limitations and ongoing updates to keep it relevant.\n\nA good checklist. The real work is living up to it.\n\nI wanted to see if, according to GPT-5, PYMNTS Intelligence data did. So, not knowing what I\u2019d get back, I asked the question.\n\n\u201cPYMNTS Intelligence data is widely recognized for its credibility and reliability, which stem from several key factors that contribute to the confidence users place in it.

These best practices ensure that their data is not only accurate but also relevant and actionable, allowing businesses, researchers, and policymakers to use it with confidence.\u201d\n\nThe website is being updated as we speak! Seriously, that was pretty awesome to read because that is the outcome we work hard to achieve. Surveys are designed to avoid leading questions. Samples are painstakingly structured to match the populations being studied. Respondents are validated to exclude bots and low-quality responses, eliminating as many as 40% of respondents as not being human, someone misrepresenting themselves, or not providing credible responses. Results are checked against multiple reputable sources. Methodologies and limitations are disclosed in every report.\n\nI believe that\u2019s why PYMNTS Intelligence data is used by banks, corporates, FinTechs, retailers and policymakers to make strategic decisions. They trust our process, and by extension, they trust the output.\n\nWhy Data Integrity Is the North Star\n\nData can be provocative. It can challenge what people think they know. That\u2019s healthy. But only if the work can stand up to scrutiny. Collecting and cleaning data is only half the job. The other half is reading it right. Every data point lives in a moment. Good interpretation respects those limits.\n\nOver more than a decade of producing research and publishing our key findings, we\u2019ve produced work that has challenged conventional wisdom. But at the same time, introduced a data-driven point of view offering balance and a new angle to the topics shaping the digital economy.\n\nWhen we began tracking how consumers self-report their financial lifestyle in March 2020, we created the first ongoing trendline showing that two-thirds of consumers live paycheck to paycheck. And, boy, were we challenged by a lot of very prominent voices. But our methodology made an important distinction the headlines never made. Some live that way by choice, structuring their spending and savings around regular income, while others \u2014 about 28% of those living paycheck-to-paycheck \u2014 do so by necessity, struggling to cover bills.\n\nThat nuance mattered. Without it, the conversation about financial stress risked becoming one-dimensional. Our clarity in definitions and sampling allowed businesses, policymakers and the media to talk about solutions tailored to different realities because our data made the difference visible.\n\nWhen the buzz around Apple Pay and mobile wallets suggested rapid adoption after Apple Pay launched in October of 2014, our studies showed something different. In-store use struggled to ignite, and a decade later has largely flatlined. Today, the slow in-store curve is widely accepted. And our early numbers are now the historical record.\n\nFor years, the dominant narrative around Buy Now, Pay Later was that it was a product for the credit-challenged and they\u2019d get into big credit trouble for using it. Our data was the first to show that adoption was much broader. That even Prime consumers and higher-income households were using BNPL, including for everyday purchases like groceries. The insight that paying for groceries in installments was not fundamentally different from using a credit card reframed how the product was discussed in the market. So did data that shows that most BNPL users, like most credit card users, are good stewards of the credit because they value having access to it. It also influenced how providers positioned BNPL to mainstream customers and how other media now cover the topic.\n\nThe Cost of Uncertainty to Business\n\nIn January 2024 we began tracking the cost of uncertainty for middle-market companies, well before tariffs made the headlines. Our surveys and data models quantified the effect uncertainty was having on investment, hiring and pricing decisions. Then, not knowing for sure cost businesses roughly 4% of annual revenue.\n\nEighteen months later, with tariff-related disruptions now in play, we can show how businesses have shifted behavior over time, and how the cost of uncertainty is a driver of those decisions. In terms of dollars and cents, the cost of high levels of uncertainty is double that for the average firm, and for consumer products companies it\u2019s even higher. That foresight means our readers didn\u2019t just see the current moment; they understood how we got here and how those trendlines might shift moving forward.\n\nHow the World Does Digital\n\nA quarterly 11-country study of 216,679 consumers since 2022 shows the impact of connected devices and apps on how \u201cdigital\u201d the world is. We created an index measuring \u201cdigital days\u201d that tallied how many digital activities consumers across all demographics do during their day. We learned many things. Some not so surprising (like older generations are the laggards) and some pretty unexpected, like telehealth usage dropped after COVID, and the French have the most engaged Gen Z population of any country studied.\n\nAnd that an emerging economy, Brazil, is the most digitally engaged country of all those we studied, including the U.S., U.K., five countries in the EU and Singapore.\n\nA year ago, we started measuring the impact of generative AI on business. What we found surprised even seasoned executives. Enterprise C-suites were already using Gen AI to inform some of their most strategic decisions even if they couldn\u2019t pinpoint a direct ROI. Our methodology captured this not through vague sentiment questions, but through detailed probes about use cases, decision areas and organizational adoption levels. The result was an early warning that Gen AI was not just a tech story. It was a strategy story.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was a once-in-a-century shock to the global economy. Tariff changes and trade disruptions over the past few months represent the most significant shift in global commerce in nearly a hundred years. Shocks of that magnitude make traditional, rear-view-mirror data subject to change as data collection and reporting chases the reality of consumer and business behavior.\n\nIn 2020, consumer habits changed in weeks. Physical shifted to digital literally overnight. Supply chains were stressed. . Industries that had been stable for decades experienced swings that rendered old baselines irrelevant. Measuring shopping behaviors by the channels consumers shopped became irrelevant. More important was the degree to which their digital shift would stick once people felt safe to return to the physical world.\n\nThe same dynamic is now unfolding in 2025 with the reconfiguration of global trade flows, as tariffs and supply chain realignments ripple through manufacturing, retail and logistics. The lack of certainty for businesses shifts investment and hiring decisions. For consumers, even those with job stability, spending and savings patterns shift.\n\nReal, reliable data powers the modern economy, enabling businesses to innovate, personalize and predict.\n\nAt the same time, the rise of fraudulent data and the overwhelming complexity of interpreting vast data sets require a careful balance. Businesses must not only rely on high-quality data but also seek to understand the underlying motivations that drive consumer and business behavior, ensuring that their data-driven decisions go beyond simple transactional models to offer deeper, more meaningful insights.\n\nOver the years, we\u2019ve learned that data integrity comes from a blend of science and art.\n\nThe science is the methodology. The art is the interpretation. Transparency is non-negotiable.\n\nHow do you see it?\n\nJoin the more than 14,000 subscribers who\u2019ve already said yes to what\u2019s NEXT.",

      "text": "Cash flow is always top of mind for any business. That\u2019s even more true when economic, policy and regulatory conditions shift. As the Trump administration applies sweeping global tariffs, consumers are pulling back on spending. Along with uncertainty about the levies\u2019 longer-term status, the rapid changes are creating a newly volatile operating environment that is severely pressuring some enterprises. Fewer than 1 in 2 U.S. small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) currently have access to any form of financing, new PYMTS Intelligence data shows. Thirteen percent with no access to financing consider their survival at risk in the next two years. Overall, 6.9% think they might not survive.\nWhile such pessimism pervades nearly 20% of smaller businesses, the situation is potentially precarious for half. Some 50% currently rely solely on their daily sales or owners\u2019 personal savings to survive. By contrast, those with business credit cards report high levels of satisfaction. Meanwhile, others that can\u2019t secure financing through mainstream credit sources\u2014perhaps because they\u2019re seen as high risk or don\u2019t have sufficient collateral\u2014often turn to riskier options, such as unsecured loans or personal credit cards. It should thus come as no surprise that businesses with access to traditional sources of financing are more confident in their ability to navigate current economic headwinds and their chances of survival in the long term.\nAt the same time, many SMBs that lack access to any form of financing, whether traditional or alternative, also claim not to need it. That is a counterintuitive finding amid an uncertain business environment where survival depends on the ability to tap timely funding.\nThese are just some of the findings detailed in \u201cBrewing Storm: Why 1 in 5 Smaller Businesses Without Financing Fear They May Not Survive Tariffs,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence report. This edition examines SMBs\u2019 access to and use of varied financing sources. The report draws on insights from a survey of 560 SMBs conducted from Feb. 5, 2025, to Feb. 12, 2025.\nSurvival at Risk\nOne in five SMBs are worried about staying open.\nPYMNTS Intelligence finds that businesses without access to traditional financing are much less confident in their ability to adapt to a changing economic environment and remain in operation. During the survey in early to mid-February, some 6.9% of all SMBs said they were unlikely to survive the next two years. This figure spikes to 13% among SMBs without access to financing, an 86% increase.\nPYMNTS Intelligence found that 44% of SMBs had access to any form of financing. Just 36% had access to readily available cash, including another 8% that also had cash in the bank.\nFewer than 3 in 10, or 28%, of all SMBs have business credit cards. But those cardholders are satisfied with that form of financing. Sixty-four percent of businesses with access to any form of financing use their corporate cards to withdraw money for business operations. The cards offer SMBs many advantages, allowing them to access cash on a moment\u2019s notice for generally low fees, as long as repayments are made on time. Four in 10 businesses with access to financing use personal credit cards held by their owners. This is a riskier financing method as it intertwines the owner\u2019s personal and business finances. Instability in either area could potentially wreck the owner\u2019s or their company\u2019s financial well-being.\nTwenty-eight percent of SMBs used other financing sources, such as bank loans or investment assets. These credit options carry risks, such as higher fees or penalties if repayments aren\u2019t made promptly.\nSignificantly, most SMBs did not have access to any financing. Such businesses instead relied solely on money from day-to-day sales or cash in the bank for survival. These SMBs have little to no safety net in the event of economic changes or declining revenue. A single slow business day could potentially jeopardize vendor payments or payroll, putting their financial future in peril. PYMNTS Intelligence found that 16% of SMBs did not have access to cash. Four in 10 had only cash in the bank. Specific industries are more vulnerable than others. For example, 64% of hotel, restaurant and entertainment companies\u2019 sole financing option was cash they had in the bank.\nThe more precarious a business\u2019s financial health, the more likely it correlates with financing access. More than 1 in 3, or 35%, of SMBs with decreasing revenue had no access to cash in the bank or readily available cash, compared to just 8% of firms with increasing revenue. Banks and credit card providers are more willing to extend credit to successful businesses, as there is a greater chance of them making repayments on time.\nSMBs Weigh Risky Financing Options\nBusiness credit cards are a favorite source of financing, but many SMBs turn to riskier options when they are desperate.\nBusiness credit cards are clearly the favorite option for SMBs with access to financing. This is because these cards offer instant access to cash up to a credit limit at any time. Our research finds that 44% of SMBs with access to financing used these cards in the last 12 months, with no other source of financing used by more than 15% of these firms\u2014a testament to the cards\u2019 reputation for convenience and reliability among SMB owners. SMBs see business credit cards as a safety net. These cards are popular with businesses regardless of their optimism about survival. Forty-four percent of SMBs who said it was very likely they would survive the next two years used such cards. That\u2019s similar to the 45% of those who said their survival was somewhat likely and 40% who said the chances of survival were slim or not at all likely.\nDespite business credit cards being the top financing choice, SMBs that were more pessimistic about their long-term survival were much more likely to use riskier sources of financing as they maxed out their card limits. Twenty-seven percent of businesses that said it was unlikely they would survive the next two years used personal credit cards. Some 19% used unsecured bank loans, which typically have higher interest rates.\nIn general, companies with lower revenues were more likely to use personal credit sources for financing. Owners of firms with $150,000 or less in annual revenue used personal loans, personal investment assets, loans from employees, loans from family and friends and home mortgages much more often compared to firms with higher revenues. Each of these options carries personal and reputational risk, but businesses this cash-poor often do not qualify for better options.\nFinancing for Navigating Economic Troubles\nSMBs with access to financing are more confident in their ability to weather economic turbulence.\nHaving access to cash and financing means that a business can continue to pay its vendors, make payroll and cover other day-to-day functionalities, even if revenues slow down. One example of this can be seen in SMBs\u2019 plans to navigate potential tariffs. Businesses with access to financing and cash are 23% more likely to be very confident in their ability to navigate tariffs compared to those who do not have access to financing or cash. Meanwhile, SMBs that do not have access to financing are 75% more likely to have no plan to help offset any additional costs from tariffs.\nBusinesses in different industries also said they would deploy different tactics to combat the adverse effects of tariffs. The retail industry is the most likely to replace foreign suppliers with domestic ones, with 36% of retailers saying they would leverage this strategy. Hotels and restaurants said they would negotiate with suppliers and use alternative materials. Professional services firms were the least likely to have a plan to respond to tariffs. However, those businesses rely the least on imported goods and are the least likely to be directly affected by the levies.\nSMBs Cope With Lack of Financing\nMany SMBs claim not to need financing. But they also don\u2019t have access to it.\nBusinesses have many reasons for not using credit financing, ranging from high fees and interest rates (cited by 27% of survey respondents) to high repayments (17%) to concerns about data security (8%). The most oft-cited reason was lack of need. We found that 43% of SMBs that did not use any financing in the past 12 months said they did not require it. Surprisingly, 3 in 4 SMBs without any access to financing claimed they did not need it.\nRead More\nPYMNTS Intelligence is the leading provider of information on the trends driving SMB growth.

      "text": "Last year, a finance worker in Hong Kong transferred $25 million to fraudsters after a video call with what appeared to be the company\u2019s chief financial officer and other executives. The twist? Every participant on the call was a deepfake.\nThat defrauded business wasn\u2019t alone. The PYMNTS Intelligence April 2025 Invoice-to-Pay Automation Tracker\u00ae Series, \u201cRising Risk: Confronting Modern AP Fraud Threats\u201d found that 90% of firms in the United States reported being targeted by cyberfraud in 2024. Business email compromise attacks affected 63% of companies \u2014 a 103% increase from the previous year.\nStill, the deepfake incident underscores a chilling reality. Generative AI has transformed financial fraud, making it more sophisticated and harder to detect. While businesses harness its capabilities for efficiency, cybercriminals exploit it to craft convincing fraudulent schemes.\nGenAI\u2019s Growing Role in Financial Deception\nToday\u2019s AI-driven attacks aren\u2019t limited to phish-y emails. Fraudsters now employ voice cloning and deepfake videos to impersonate executives, tricking employees into authorizing large fund transfers. The accessibility of generative AI tools means that even low-level scammers can produce high-quality forgeries, blurring the lines between genuine and fake communications.\nThe report found that accounts payable (AP) departments have become prime targets for these advanced fraud techniques. Research indicated that 68% of organizations encountered at least one fraud attempt in 2024, with AP fraud manifesting in various forms, including phishing attacks, account takeovers and invoice fraud.\nAP departments might as well have a target on their back. The traditional manual processes involved are ill-equipped to combat threats like generative AI. As fraudsters use AI to automate and scale their attacks, the reactive nature of manual fraud detection leaves businesses exposed.\nIn 2024, 86% of U.S. companies targeted by fraud reported financial losses, with nearly half losing more than $10 million. Beyond the immediate monetary impact, businesses face reputational damage, regulatory penalties and erosion of stakeholder trust.\nAt the same time, the psychological toll on employees who fall victim to these scams can\u2019t be overlooked. The guilt and stress associated with being deceived by convincing forgeries can affect morale and productivity.\nCountermeasures: Embracing AI for Defense\nTo combat the escalating threat, businesses are turning to AI-driven solutions. Advanced fraud detection systems use machine learning to identify anomalies in transaction patterns, flagging suspicious activities in real time. These systems can adapt to evolving fraud tactics, offering a proactive defense mechanism.\nIntegrating AI into AP processes can automate invoice verification, cross-referencing details with existing records to detect inconsistencies. By reducing reliance on manual checks, businesses can enhance accuracy and speed, minimizing the window of opportunity for fraudsters.\nTechnology alone isn\u2019t a panacea; businesses must cultivate a culture of vigilance. Regular training sessions can equip employees with the knowledge to identify and report suspicious activities. Implementing strict verification protocols, especially for high-value transactions, adds another layer of security.\nCollaboration is also key. Sharing information about emerging threats and successful countermeasures within industry networks can help organizations stay ahead of fraudsters.\nIn this high-stakes game of cat and mouse, complacency is not an option. As generative AI continues to evolve, so will the tactics of cybercriminals. Businesses must remain agile, continuously updating their defense mechanisms and staying informed about the latest threats.\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."

      "text": "Apple Pay wasn\u2019t the world\u2019s first digital wallet \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t even the first mobile wallet developed by Big Tech (remember Google Wallet in 2011?) \u2014 but it was the first wallet connected to an indispensable piece of hardware, from a brand that users loved and considered their lifeline to the digital economy.\nThe promise at launch was to use the iPhone and Apple Pay combo to replace cards entirely at the physical point of sale \u2014 at least, that\u2019s what Tim Cook promised. It seemed like a lofty ambition in 2014 since not many iPhone users had the right phones to activate Apple Pay then, many merchants lacked contactless terminals to accept it, and few issuers were willing to provision cards for it (and pay Apple a fee to do it).\nAccording to PYMNTS Intelligence, in the U.S., Apple Pay usage and adoption have grown over the last 10 years since most of those initial barriers are in the rearview. Apple makes it nearly impossible to activate an iPhone without installing Apple Pay, more issuers enable cards to be provisioned to the wallet, just about all merchants have contactless terminals now, and tap-to-phone payments expand acceptance beyond fixed terminals in stores.\nGlobally, there are reportedly now 744 million active Apple Pay users, more than double in 2017.\nApple Pay at 10\nAccording to the PYMNTS Intelligence report, in the U.S., the result has been strong Apple Pay growth as a percentage of retail sales volume. Between 2014 and 2021, Apple Pay growth sort of flatlined. Between 2022 and 2024, Apple Pay grew rapidly. Its growth over those two years was 41%.\nAt the ten-year mark, Apple Pay has a 5.6% share of retail sales. Increased merchant acceptance drove 58% of that lift. In other words, Apple Pay users could \u2014 and did \u2014 use it to pay for their purchases at more stores. Most of those purchases came from gas and C-stores, grocery stores and restaurants.\nWhere Apple Pay hasn\u2019t fared as well is getting more iPhone users on Team Apple Pay. More than 90% of iPhone users who could tap their phone instead of a card when shopping in a store still don\u2019t. Less than 20% of Apple Pay\u2019s growth over the last decade has come from new users. We also see that instore use and adoption has started to plateau.\nGrowing More Users\nApple Pay\u2019s challenge, as with any new way to pay, is to expand beyond the early adopters to the mainstream consumers \u2014 who still think cards work just fine. Apple Pay has a massive 54% share of the in-store mobile wallet usage (the other 46% is captured by PayPal, Google, Cash App, Walmart, Samsung, and Venmo), but it\u2019s still a pretty small pond. Physical cards remain its most formidable competitor. At least for right now.\nMonetizing Apple Pay matters a lot to Apple. It\u2019s a cornerstone element of the high-margin Services revenue bucket that is a hedge to what has become a less predictable iPhone revenue and profits backstop.\nToday, 46% of Apple\u2019s revenue comes from the iPhone, with the U.S. as its biggest market. Europe at 26% represents a distant second; China at 17% a distant third. Across the business, Apple averages a net margin of about 46.26% as of Q3 2024, down slightly. The drag on profits has come from the hardware side of the business which has seen margins slip to 35%.\nServices, though, is where the magic happens. At 28.2% of revenue, as of Q3 2024, Services account for nearly three quarters (74%) of Apple\u2019s profits.\nServices revenue has seen strong growth over the years, most recently reporting a 14% rise year over year. Specifically, Services is the bundle of revenue from the App Store developer fees, AppleCare, Apple Pay, Apple One/Apple\u2019s subscription business like Music and TV, its ad business and the search exclusivity payment from Google. Apple Services has more than a billion subscribers to its services. Its retail ad platform generated $7.5 billion in revenue so far, almost as much as all of Foot Locker\u2019s revenue in 2023.\nA Slippery Grip on Handsets\nYet, Apple can\u2019t assume that its grip on the handset market in the U.S. and globally is secure, despite an early strong showing in China for iPhone 16 sales. Apple\u2019s share of smartphones in the U.S. has remained relatively flat since 2020 \u2014 which is part of the reason Apple stopped reporting the number of devices sold.\nWithout handset sales, there isn\u2019t Apple Services revenue. And without its current App Store business model, its profit engine is at risk.\nOpening its NFC chip to rivals will create competition at the point of sale for iPhone users who will have the option to use a different wallet to pay for purchases in the store. That has the potential to divert wallet volume, and the revenues from it, away from Apple Pay.\nAt the same time, Apple Pay\u2019s reach is only as deep as its share of handsets in the market, consumers that use it and merchants that accept it. In the U.S., that\u2019s roughly half of the smartphone installed base; globally it\u2019s far less. And as we\u2019ve seen, getting more existing iPhone users to use Apple Pay in the U.S. is the big nut to crack. Along with convincing the world\u2019s biggest physical retailer, Walmart, to join Team Apple Pay, which is where 9.4% of retail spend in the U.S. happens.\nFor Cupertino, the soul-searching for their infamous \u201cone more thing\u201d must address the four fundamental threats to Apple\u2019s iPhone-centric business model. That\u2019s where the combination of regulator pressure and GenAI have the potential to become the biggest disruption to the smartphone ecosystem since Apple\u2019s launch of the iPhone in 2007. And its App Store a year later.\nThreat Number One: GenAI as Device and Operating System Disruptor\nNext month will mark two years since OpenAI made ChatGPT accessible to the world. Each month when PYMNTS Intelligence asks a panel of C-suite enterprise executives to identify leaders in GenAI and LLMs, Apple doesn\u2019t make the short list. This despite Apple\u2019s early embrace of voice-assisted AI with the introduction of Siri in 2011 and after reportedly spending $20 billion in AI development costs over the last five years. Insiders say that Apple is at least two years behind in its development and commercialization of GenAI.\nWe\u2019ll finally see Apple Intelligence on October 28, more than a year and a half since the launch of powerful LLMs by Google, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft, and about a month after the launch of the iPhone 16 handset. Apple is said to have spent $1 billion developing Apple Intelligence. With it, Apple hopes to persuade fan boys and girls to upgrade to its latest model.\nApple\u2019s last-to-market entry with GenAI faces high expectations for what it must deliver. More than 200 million people have already downloaded and are using GenAI apps on their mobile devices. According to Statista, more than 4 million people in the U.S. downloaded ChatGPT in September 2024 alone. Those users are already getting, using and integrating GenAI into their everyday experiences, including voice-activated features and prompts to write better-sounding emails.\nThat means that Apple\u2019s version of GenAI will have to be a real knock-your-socks-off experience beyond the much hyped Genmoji feature to get users to shell out $1,100 for a new phone or even to show the world that Apple is a player in GenAI. Despite the investments so far, some still say that Siri isn\u2019t any smarter than she is now and lags GPT in accuracy. [Cue the Genmoji sad face.]\nThen there is the potential of the yet unknown Gen-AI powered device that lots of entrepreneurs are surely thinking about.\nJony Ive and OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman have raised $1 billion to fund the development of a device and operating system that they say will be as disruptive to the personal computing space as the iPhone was in 2007. Ive ought to know \u2014 he was among the iPhone\u2019s early masterminds.\nAlthough there\u2019s no time yet slated for its release, it looms as a longer-term potential threat to Apple, along with all the under-the-radar ventures that are almost certainly trying to disrupt the smartphone model.\nThose risks are especially concerning given that iPhone upgrade cycles, always an Apple tailwind, average about three years. And Apple\u2019s success beyond its core hardware products (iPhone, MacBook, Air Pods, and the Apple Watch) has been fleeting. The Home Pod was a dud, and Vision Pro is a cool headset in search of an audience beyond fanboys. Apple\u2019s self-driving car, Project Titan, was driven to the junk yard in February after a decade of work and $10 billion of investment.\nThat sort of makes the iPhone Apple\u2019s biggest, and most enduring, one-hit wonder.\nIt\u2019s also been 17 years since we\u2019ve seen a new form factor and operating system appear in the everyday smartphone/smart device category. Based on interviews with Altman and Ive, it seems their device won\u2019t be a phone but something different, connected and GenAI powered. It\u2019s entirely possible that Apple\u2019s early adopter fanboys (and girls) could be persuaded to find a new favorite.\nIn the more immediate term, GenAI phones by Google, Samsung, Xiaomi and Huawei are hitting the smartphone market. IDC forecasts that the sales of GenAI powered smartphones will increase 364% year over year in 2024, and 73% in 2025. These are all Android devices, presumably powered by Google AI. Google is light years ahead of Apple in AI and its application to use cases with a demonstrable impact on business and society. The Nobel Foundation thinks so too, awarding two 2024 Nobel prizes to now or recent Google employees for their AI achievements.\nBottom line: Consumers with curiosity right now have different hardware options to connect them to ecosystems that are accessed using GenAI tools and operating systems. And for the moment, they aren\u2019t iPhones.\nThreat Number Two: App Store Business Model Pressure\nThe Epic Apple antitrust case was the starting gun for the unraveling of Apple\u2019s hold on its App Store business model, the primary driver of Apple\u2019s Services revenue and its profits.\nApple was forced by EU regulators this year to open its App ecosystem to rival processors. It was also found in violation of the Digital Markets Act in June 2024 over fees that are \u201cbeyond what is absolutely necessary,\u201d and fined $1.8 billion. Apple now allows developers free rein to process payments outside of the App Store, but not because they decided it was the nice thing to do.\nAccording to Reuters, in August, Apple also reduced its developer commissions, putting in place a structure that includes an initial 5% acquisition fee for new users and a 10% store services fee for any sales made by app users on any platform within a year of the app installation.\nIn the U.S., Apple made the magnanimous concession to reduce developer commissions from 30% to 27% in year one while also allowing developers to process payments outside of the App Store. Now there is a dynamic in play where the judge in the Apple/Epic case could force Apple to lower its fees and be more open. And a larger, more serious antitrust case is just getting started, where the DOJ \u2014 following its huge win against Google Search \u2014 is targeting Apple and its App Store business model.\nIt\u2019s not possible for developers to sidestep Apple App Store fees now, but that could change quickly and likely will globally.\nThreat Number Three: Searching to Keep the Google Search Exclusivity Windfall\nThen there\u2019s not often cited, but massive, threat to margin and revenue from the potential loss of the exclusive Google search revenue deal.\nAs part of the Google antitrust proceedings, court documents disclosed that Google\u2019s payment of $20 billion in 2022 to Apple to power search on Safari accounted for 36% of Safari\u2019s revenue. More importantly, it accounted for 17.5% of Apple\u2019s operating income, based on 2022 results. And largely pure profit to Apple.\nDepending on the final ruling on remedies by the court in the DOJ lawsuit, that payment could be gone forever, or severely reduced. That\u2019s a lot of revenue, and margin, to replace when the case is finally settled.\nThreat Number Four: Cracking Open the Chip\nOpening Apple\u2019s NFC chip to rivals is now possible with the release of iOS 18.1. Now any wallet that is an app on the iPhone can be used to pay at the physical point of sale.\nThat creates new competition for Apple Pay at the in-store point of sale. There are early signs that PayPal, with its cross-platform digital wallet as an app on the iPhone, may be getting some in-store traction. Anyone with an iPhone and a PayPal app can now pay at the point of sale and online \u2014 just about anywhere they shop now \u2014 using it. PayPal counts 278 million users in the U.S. who have PayPal wallets now that they can use on and offline to shop and pay.\nAccording to PYMNTS Intelligence, we already see the share of consumers with any phone using PayPal to pay at the physical point of sale increase by 31% year over year. Once a distant second, the gap between Apple Pay and PayPal in-store is only 18%. We\u2019ll see if that gap shrinks further over the next 12 months.\nIn addition to creating wallet competition in-store, access to the iPhone NFC SE creates an advantage for apps and wallets that are cross-platform and cross-channel. This is particularly important for the growing number of Click-and-Mortar\u2122 shoppers who want the same experience shopping in-store as they do online. That includes shopping history and order history, regardless of whether a purchase was made in a store, in an app or on a web site. That\u2019s a barrier for Apple Pay right now, and these shoppers now account for more in-store shopping and mobile wallet use.\nPYMNTS Intelligence found that between 2020 and 2023, the share of U.S. consumers shopping in-store grew by 28%, largely due to a rise in the share of Click-and-Mortar\u2122 shoppers. From 2022 to 2024, the share of consumers who use mobile wallets for in-store transactions rose 33%, indicating mobile wallet use in-store is going up with Click-and-Mortar\u2122 shopping. Providers with apps that cross platforms pose an even greater threat to Apple Pay, particularly from the digital-first Click-and-Mortar Shopper whose ranks are the parents, high income and younger consumers who spend a lot today and will continue to spend in the future.\nAnd growing competition for Apple and Apple Pay, whose payment options are limited outside of the Apple ecosystem.\nFilling the Cracks\nAs Apple looks ahead to 2025 and the rest of the decade, the big drivers of Apple\u2019s revenue and profit engine face intense pressure. That has implications for what Apple may want \u2014 or need \u2014 Apple Pay to deliver.\nIn China, its presence is likely short-lived given intense competition from good smartphone makers that have optimized for the WeChat ecosystem and political pressures favoring domestic manufacturers. At the same time, the population of younger consumers there is shrinking, and the economy is in free fall. Both reduce the pool of potential Chinese iPhone customers.\nIn Apple\u2019s second-largest market, the EU, where the regulators have Apple and Apple Pay squarely in their sights, the current crackdown seems more like a warm-up act than the grand finale. In the U.S., political, regulatory and legislative pressure will continue to force change voluntarily or via mandates. Apple\u2019s business model will continue to be the subject of intense and ongoing scrutiny, along with every other Big Tech business model.\nAt the same time, Apple\u2019s competition is using new technology to reimagine the relationship that consumers have with devices and the digital economy. GenAI is both a massive source of innovation and disruption. For Apple, at least so far, it has been the latter and not the former.\nWhen it comes to payments, one of the remarkable innovations that emerged from Apple Pay is the tokenization of credentials, which streamlines the payments and commerce experience for online and in-app transactions. But Apple with Apple Pay doesn\u2019t have a lock on that tech.\nAs tokenization evolves beyond secure and stored account credentials to digital identity and shopper preferences, form factors and the commerce experience will evolve, too. Tokenized credentials become digital commerce passports and form-factor agnostic. Like the iPhone in 2007, we won\u2019t really know it until we see it. And just like what happened to the ubiquitous Blackberry that no one ever said they could live without, if the experience is amazing enough, it won\u2019t take long for fanboys to become fans of the next big thing. And for new business models to emerge that encourage adoption and usage.\nThe Next 10 Years\nFor Apple, over the next five to 10 years, the test will be whether it can really walk the talk as a Services-first business that just happens to produce handsets that people like and use. It seems an unlikely pivot for a business that is all about closed ecosystems and getting more and more people to live within them. And to monetize that engagement while there.\nWhat is likely is that Apple will look to where the big pools of transacting happen on their platform and decide to monetize the apps that drive it.\nFor example, Apple could expand its App Store fee to services platforms like Uber, DoorDash and Airbnb. Or decide that any sales made from shopping apps, of which there are almost 80,000, are subject to an App Store fee, too.\nApple could also decide to double down on Apple Pay as the Services monetization engine. It could decide that any app stored inside the Apple Pay wallet gets monetized when onboarded, accessed, and/or used. It could decide to take a small cut of sales made by any merchant that an Apple Pay user initiates from the Apple Wallet. It could white-label the Discover Network and make Apple Pay a payments new rail.\nRegardless, Apple\u2019s options and decisions will be closely watched by courts, regulators and legislators who increasingly see Apple as uncooperative in following their decisions.\nA final thought.\nTim Cook was quoted in a Wall Street Journal article yesterday saying that Apple\u2019s mission isn\u2019t to \u201cbe first, but best.\u201d\nExcept the iPhone really was the first and the best.\nApple AI (Siri) was one of the first and now one of the worst, and its EV wasn\u2019t first and is now dead. Whether \u201cfirst not best\u201d is the Apple mission today or just how things have turned out is subject to debate.\nBut it seems the anthesis of what made Apple great and delivered innovations like the iPod, iTunes and the iPhone that changed the world and the consumer\u2019s access to the digital economy. And that made everyone rush headfirst into the market to replicate."

      "text": "Google is gearing up to give merchants a sneak peek at its normally top secret search data.\nYesterday (Oct. 20), Alphabet (the new(gle) Google) gave the world a gander at its Shopping Insights tool, which allows retailers to see what products are being searched for in 16,000 U.S. cities and towns. This early version scales across 5,000 products currently on sale through the Shopping ad service that month. The long-term plan includes a more extensive product list and updates that occur more often than monthly.\nThe service is geared to allow retailers to get a window into regional demand and to retarget their advertising accordingly. The Google Shopping platform leverages a different variety of search ad in that it relies on massive data feeds from a variety of retailers (e.g., Walmart, Target and Best Buy) and makes sure that items are displayed with photos and detailed listings. This is a big change from keyword-focused search ads.\nEstimates put Google Shopping\u2019s annual revenue at around $2 billion and poised to grow, particularly if it shows demonstrable gains for retailers looking for a mobile edge. While Google Trends points to some of this data, Shopping Insights provides more granular detail about devices, products and locations. The insights tool also aggregates product interest from a variety of similar search terms. For example, \u201cPandora bracelet,\u201d \u201cPandora charm bracelet\u201d and \u201cPandora bracelets\u201d will all be grouped together.\nGoogle said the new tool is one of many tools designed to provide its merchant partners \u201cwith deeper insights about users\u2019 intent and context.\u201d\nThose insights are important to retailers, particularly the move away from keywords, which many have complained can miss the demand expressed by other similar (but not included) keywords or phrases.\nTo check out what else is HOT in the world of payments, click here."

      "text": "A six-figure income, a house in a nice neighborhood, two cars in the garage and kids in private schools \u2014 yet still feeling panicked when an emergency expense hits. And while the Fed once held out $400 as the average emergency expense threshold, that unexpected expense is now more likely to be about three times as much.\nFor millions of Americans, this isn\u2019t a hypothetical \u2014 it\u2019s their reality.\nToday, some 67% of Americans say they live paycheck to paycheck, according to a recent PYMNTS Intelligence study. The paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle spans income brackets, education levels and professions. The every-other-week rhythm of waiting for the next paycheck has become America\u2019s most common financial heartbeat.\nRead More: Paycheck-to-Paycheck Ranks Swell as Rising Prices Erode Savings\nLiving paycheck to paycheck means consumers need their next paycheck to meet their monthly obligations. How much of a cash cushion they have is hugely important in determining how far consumers are willing to push their paychecks every month \u2014 and how stressed out they might be if faced with an unexpected financial shock.\nA possibility that could become more of a certainty as the latest news out of Washington is that President Trump declines to rule out the possibility of a recession in 2025 \u2014 and lots of analysts agree.\nFor me, the paycheck-to-paycheck conversation was turned on its head about nine years ago.\nIn May 2016, I came across a cover story in The Atlantic titled \u201cThe Secret Shame of Middle Class Americans.\u201d The author, Neil Gaber, described his personal story of living paycheck to paycheck, despite a career as a successful writer, and \u2014 in his words \u2014 being \u201creasonably prosperous.\u201d\nAlthough he was \u201cnowhere near rich,\u201d he earned a \u201cmiddle to upper-middle income\u201d salary, lived in Manhattan and sent his two daughters to private school. Yet, he describes being unable to cobble together enough money to cover a $400 emergency expense without having to ask friends or family members, including his own grown daughters sometimes, to pitch in.\nHis 6156-word story wasn\u2019t intended to garner sympathy. It was intended to shed light on the paycheck-to-paycheck treadmill that he and his family \u2014 and, he contended, many middle-income Americans \u2014 were on.\nGaber described the emotional toll that his \u201cfinancial impotence\u201d took as he tried hard to shield the family from the many financial bumps in the road. He admits that most of his financial issues were related to the lumpy nature of how he was paid: lump sum book advances that created tax issues and the need for disciplined financial management over several years as he completed his novels.\nThen there were unexpected ups and downs of life that delivered painful financial gotchas.\nSelling his co-op in Manhattan to reduce his monthly housing costs took two years, during which time he paid double housing costs; book deals took longer to finalize and writing gigs got axed. Saving money was a challenge. Credit cards helped stretch his income but came with revolving debt at high interest rates that only compounded the problem.\nBut mostly, Gaber said, his paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle was his choice.\nHis choice to be a writer, and specifically a novelist, with the unpredictable income swings and caps inherent in that profession. His choice to live in New York rather than a cheaper place. His choice to pay for private school and college for his girls, their weddings and childcare as they grew up.\nGaber said that his paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle wasn\u2019t the result of living \u201can extravagant lifestyle\u201d but something more fundamental: too little income, too many expenses in the choices he and his wife made. And those choices had consequences over time, including an inability to save as much as he needed or wanted to.\nHis story stuck with me, mostly because it was antithetical to the stereotypical paycheck-to-paycheck persona: poor, uneducated, unemployed, with few future prospects.\nAnd Gaber\u2019s claim that more middle-class Americans fit that definition than were willing to admit it.\nIn March of 2020, the PYMNTS Intelligence team began to benchmark the paycheck-to-paycheck status of Americans as part of our monthly consumer studies related to COVID, the digital shift and how people spent and saved their money.\nIt seemed like a good time to gather and benchmark intelligence about how consumers would spend and save their income.\nThe U.S. was entering a once-in-a-hundred-year global pandemic, a period of instability and uncertainty. Documenting all the puts and takes would offer important insights for businesses, startups and investors. To our knowledge, this effort is the largest dataset documenting the shift to digital and the related spending and payments behaviors over that period \u2014 and those studies continue to this day.\nTo capture the paycheck-to-paycheck sentiment, we asked U.S. consumers to self-report their financial lifestyle against whether they need their next paycheck to meet their monthly financial obligations. And if they say they do, whether they can do that comfortably or whether they will struggle to make all payments on time.\nOur results over this five-year period are remarkably consistent with the personal story Gaber recounted in May 2016.\nThey suggest that the American consumer\u2019s relationship with money goes well beyond simple income calculations. It speaks to their values, priorities and the complex balancing act between choice and necessity that shapes those personal financial decisions.\nLike Gaber\u2019s account in 2016, the American consumer\u2019s paycheck-to-paycheck status is shaped by financial obligations and lifecycle, not just income. It is often based on the choices people make about how they align their expenses to their paychecks.\nIt\u2019s not about being \u201cpoor.\u201d And alternatively, not living paycheck to paycheck isn\u2019t about being \u201crich\u201d \u2014 even though most people prefer to define it in those stark terms.\nIt isn\u2019t even about whether consumers save or don\u2019t. In fact, 4% of people living paycheck to paycheck and who report having issues paying their monthly bills and 5% of those say they live paycheck to paycheck without issues say that savings and investments are part of how they allocate their monthly income.\nInstead, we find that paycheck-to-paycheck living spans all income levels, including half of high earners (defined as those earning $100,000 or more each year) as of January 2025. Across all income groups, people report similar abilities to pay their monthly bills without a struggle but needing the next paycheck to stay on track. This implies that living paycheck to paycheck isn\u2019t solely about financial hardship or an inability to meet basic needs, but how people choose to manage their monthly income.\nHere\u2019s an example.\nIn November 2024, high-income individuals (those earning $100,000+ annually) constituted a larger portion of struggling paycheck-to-paycheck consumers than middle-income earners. At the same time, from January to April 2023, nearly 25% of lower-income individuals reported not living paycheck to paycheck, a figure that declined to just 16% by January 2025.\nConversely, the proportion of higher-income people not living paycheck to paycheck increased slightly, though with significant fluctuations throughout this period. This disparity between lower-, middle- and higher-income groups indicates either similar cost pressures across income levels or potentially different spending choices among higher earners.\nThat suggests that paycheck-to-paycheck living is a continuum between choice and necessity. This choice-necessity framework provides a unique lens for understanding the dynamic nature of paycheck-to-paycheck behaviors.\nOur research reveals that 21% of American consumers (37 million) live paycheck to paycheck primarily out of necessity \u2014 there is a significant mismatch between money in and money out every month. More than half \u2014 54%,or some 93 million consumers \u2014 do so due to a blend of choices about how they spend their paychecks and circumstances that create unexpected financial events. And 25% live this way predominantly by choice.\nHigher earners cite family support obligations (such as kids at home and their attendant expenses), debt payments and higher spending on discretionary items \u2014 food out, vacations, clothes \u2014 for living paycheck to paycheck by choice. Lower-income earners point to wages that are insufficient to cover the rising costs of basics like housing and food for living paycheck to paycheck out of necessity.\nA quarter of middle-income paycheck-to-paycheck consumers live this way by choice, unforced by necessity. Like their higher-income counterparts, their decisions, by default, become necessities as they have defined them. Sending their kids to private school, like Gaber did, was a choice, but one that he and his wife considered a necessity.\nBy contrast, over half of lower-income paycheck-to-paycheck consumers report necessity as their primary driver, because so much of their paycheck is allocated to paying for basic essentials.\nNotably, the proportion of low-income consumers living paycheck to paycheck by choice has increased 5% since 2023, while necessity-driven cases rose 3%, indicating a growing polarization in how lower income consumers now manage their income to expense ratio every month.\nAlthough these lower-income individuals are more likely to be living paycheck to paycheck by necessity, almost 1 in 4 are living this way by choice. The choice-driven group tends to be younger (Gen Z or millennials), and they are more likely to have children.\nWhether consumers are driven by choice or necessity varies by income and generation, and by how much money they have in the bank.\nPeople who live paycheck to paycheck by choice have about $1,400 more in savings than those living paycheck by necessity. And, although inadequate savings correlate with financial hardship for some, others maintain substantial savings, yet still spend most of their income each pay period.\nChoice versus necessity determines how consumers spend their paychecks every month. Regardless of how consumers define their paycheck-to-paycheck status, everyone allocates some of their income to the basics \u2014 housing and groceries. However (and not surprisingly), consumers whose paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle is shaped more by more choice than necessity allocate more of their income to discretionary expenses.\nMore than two-thirds of those consumers chose to spend money on social activities at least once a month in the past year, compared to 43% of those who live paycheck to paycheck out of necessity. Consumers who live paycheck to paycheck out of necessity are half as likely to be planning to spend on leisure, entertainment and recreational activities because they lack the cash to spend on discretionary items.\nHow paycheck-to-paycheck consumers use credit cards varies. We know that 90.5% of American consumers who want credit cards have and use them. According to the latest Federal Reserve data, American consumers have more than $1.4 trillion in credit card outstandings. Consumers have always used credit to leverage their spending power, and consumers across all paycheck-to-paycheck personas use it for that reason.\nConsumers living paycheck to paycheck either by choice or necessity have higher credit card balances than those who say they don\u2019t \u2014 and obviously for different reasons. Those who say they struggle with meeting their monthly financial obligations are much more likely to revolve their balances, using credit to fill in the gaps between paychecks or to ride the storm when unexpected expenses arise.\nA third more consumers who report struggling to meet their monthly obligations say they always revolve their credit card balances than those who say they comfortably pay their bills each month. The share of struggling paycheck-to-paycheck consumers who usually or always revolve their credit card balances has risen 7.4 percentage points since 2023.\nSavings tips the balance of the paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle. Having cash savings significantly changes how people view their financial situation and how they save or spend accordingly. Living paycheck to paycheck \u2014 or not \u2014 is also influenced by how confident people are about the adequacy of their cash cushions if something goes haywire.\nDuring COVID-19, fewer American consumers reported living paycheck to paycheck despite higher unemployment. This unexpected trend occurred because stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits provided many households with unprecedented cash reserves. Between 2021-2023, the percentage of Americans reporting paycheck-to-paycheck living dropped to 54.5% as debts decreased and savings grew.\nHaving savings doesn\u2019t automatically change whether people still think of themselves as living paycheck to paycheck, but it\u2019s an important factor, especially for those living paycheck to paycheck by choice.\nWe find that just over 40% of people with $2,500 to $5,000 in savings still choose to live paycheck to paycheck. Those with less than $1,000 in income are both more likely to live paycheck to paycheck and more likely to do so by necessity. And with $1,000 to $5,000 in savings, they feel they have some security but are more nervous, and an emergency expense of $1,200 might be enough to tip those scales.\nThe data also reveals a significant decline in self-reported paycheck-to-paycheck status once savings exceed $5,000. Those who continue identifying as paycheck to paycheck despite having over $5,000 saved appear to do so by choice rather than necessity, as they report comfort with their bill-paying ability including spending on discretionary items, while maintaining a safety net for unexpected expenses.\nThe largest generational cohort of consumers who report living paycheck to paycheck out of necessity are single millennials, many of whom live in rural locations. A third of those millennials have dependent children living at home \u2014 spending is about providing for their families, with little room for much else.\nAnalyzing five years of PYMNTS Intelligence data reveals two critical income thresholds in describing the financial lifestyle of consumers.\nThe data finds that the first significant threshold occurs at $45,000-$49,999, when individuals begin to shift from struggling paycheck-to-paycheck living to a more comfortable paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle.\nThe second critical threshold appears in the $125,000-$149,999 range, where people become increasingly likely to say they no longer live paycheck to paycheck either by choice or necessity.\nAs income climbs to more than $85,000 per year the incidence of living paycheck to paycheck by choice begins to decline as more and more consumers indicate they no longer live paycheck to paycheck at all. What\u2019s particularly interesting is that this shift is not universal, and many individuals with moderate to high incomes continue living paycheck to paycheck despite having the financial capacity to do otherwise. They\u2019re comfortable paying bills but still spend most of their income monthly because of their monthly income and savings backstop.\nSince these individuals can pay their bills comfortably, their continued paycheck-to-paycheck status suggests deliberate spending choices on more or more expensive things, rather than pure income constraints. These choices might include supporting dependents, purchasing larger homes or even second homes, or using private schools.\nIf paycheck-to-paycheck status were solely dictated by income necessity, we would expect to see a much steeper decline in all paycheck categories as income increases. However, the gradual nature of this decline suggests other factors at play, including the fact that consumers with incomes over $250,000 are 30% more likely to continue to live paycheck to paycheck (generally by choice).\nThe key insight is that even as financial capacity increases with higher incomes, many individuals continue to choose to live paycheck to paycheck rather than transitioning to non-paycheck-to-paycheck status.\nIt\u2019s been 15 years since the U.S. experienced a great recession, even though there was a slight dip in 2020 owing to the COVID shutdown. Today\u2019s environment of economic uncertainty and rising prices, the threat of tariffs and the current administration\u2019s hints at a likely recession have significant implications for all consumers and how they will spend their paychecks in the weeks and months ahead.\nConsumers across all income brackets are likely to pull back on spending, but for different reasons. Those with savings cushions may voluntarily push pause on spending until they have more certainty in order to preserve cash and income, while those without financial shock absorbers in the form of savings will be forced to cut back out of necessity.\nThe \u201ccomfortable paycheck-to-paycheck\u201d group faces particular vulnerability as economic pressures mount. The Fed is unlikely to lower interest rates in the foreseeable future, and if there is inflation because of tariffs, rates might go even higher. That\u2019s bad news for consumers with adjustable mortgage rates that are set to rollover from historically low levels around 3% \u2014 just as interest rates on their credit cards and other loans rise. That means new monthly paycheck pressures owing to the increased cost of housing and credit card debt, especially if wages don\u2019t keep pace.\nAs basic goods become more expensive due to tariffs and rising production costs, these consumers could also see their discretionary income significantly reduced.\nPYMNTS Intelligence finds that more than half of consumers surveyed in February 2025 who are knowledgeable about the proposed tariffs said their wallets would take a beating; 78% said because of higher prices, and 75% because of product shortages. Many who were previously managing comfortably may find themselves sliding into the \u201cstruggling paycheck-to-paycheck\u201d category as more of their paychecks are allocated to the basics whose monthly costs continue to rise.\nRead more: What American Consumers and Small Businesses Think About Tariffs\nThat, of course, assumes consumers have a paycheck.\nThe labor market is starting to soften \u2014 and not because of the government layoffs, which impact a relatively small part of the American workforce overall. As businesses face their own uncertainty, they will likely freeze hiring, expenses and investments to grow the business. The ripple effect of this uncertainty itself is its own force.\nAs more consumers shift from choice-based financial decisions to those driven by necessity, overall consumption could contract, challenging economic growth. Retailers and service providers may need to adjust their strategies to address a growing segment of more price-sensitive consumers across income brackets if they hope to make a sale. Even wealthy consumers who don\u2019t live paycheck to paycheck may pull back after looking at their stock portfolios and feeling less wealthy. Even the billionaires. Bloomberg reported yesterday (March 10) that the billionaires who attended President Trump\u2019s inauguration have lost $210 billon collectively over the last seven weeks.\nThat detail aside, the data emphasizes that you can\u2019t judge a paycheck-to-paycheck consumer by its cover. High earners who have structured their lifestyles around their full income with minimal savings could face similar challenges to lower-income households when economic conditions tighten.\nThe impact of economic uncertainty will be felt across the spectrum, with similar outcomes despite very different income and paycheck-to-paycheck starting points.\nAs Gaber said in his article back in May 2016, it\u2019s about choices. It isn\u2019t just how much money comes in, but the set of choices, obligations and priorities that determine where it goes.\nIn an economy increasingly characterized by unpredictability, understanding this nuanced reality isn\u2019t just navel gazing. It also isn\u2019t distorting the definition of paycheck to paycheck or its importance in understanding how consumers manage spending. It\u2019s essential for understanding how consumers will react to financial pressures, and how vulnerable large swaths of the American consumer may be.\nThe economy\u2019s resilience depends on their ability, in mass, to spend the paychecks they have \u2014 and knowing they\u2019ll keep getting them.\nWe\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.\nLearn More"

      "text": "Google\u2019s market cap topped $2 trillion last week after quarterly earnings convinced investors that demand for its GenAI platform was not only strong but being monetized in the here and now. Microsoft, according to reports, attributed 7 points of its 31% quarterly cloud revenue jump to GenAI use cases. The CFOs of both whispered the possibility of the near-term risk of demand outpacing supply, given the almost universal acceptance of the potential for GenAI\u2019s transformational impact on people, business, and society \u2014 and the fear of being left behind.\nWe see this too. A recent PYMNTS Intelligence study of how enterprise CFOs view GenAI\u2019s impact on their business finds that nearly two-thirds believe it is the most significant technological innovation of our time. They use words like \u201cgrowth,\u201d \u201csuccess,\u201d \u201cimpact,\u201d \u201cinnovation,\u201d and \u201cfuture\u201d when asked to provide a one-word description. None of the CFOs surveyed expressed a negative view, even though some admitted the need to know more about its application to their business.\nAlthough the study finds investments in GenAI to be relatively modest and experimental today, 53% of CFOs say that they\u2019ll loosen the purse strings and significantly increase those budgets company-wide in the next year. Even the CFOs who acknowledge its potential, but have been more conservative, are ready to jump in. Nearly two-thirds (65%) of those CFOs expect to increase their corporate-wide GenAI budgets by an average of 12% in the coming year.\nThe Need for a GenAI Organizing Framework\nWhat\u2019s missing in all the coverage of the models, investments, startups and GenAI applications is a framework for analyzing the link between the application of the technology and business outcomes \u2014 and how executives across an organization measure the impact of their investments to support it.\nLooking at GenAI through that lens can inform the characteristics of the companies and industry segments that recognize it as a strategic enabler to their business early on. More important, it offers a consistent way to track the impact of GenAI on business and financial performance over time. As GenAI and LLM applications become an embedded part of a business, the only way to measure the impact of this technology will be by looking at its impact on overall business outcomes.\nThat is the thesis of a new monthly PYMNTS Intelligence study we call The CAIO\u2122 Study. The first of these monthly reports will be released on Tuesday, May 14th.\nThe overall study framework consists of a proprietary weighting and scoring methodology for each of 13 activities to classify them as routine or strategic uses of GenAI. The PYMNTS Intelligence team then uses statistical techniques to examine how each activity, and groups of activities, can influence business outcomes and the return on their investments to support it, as reported by the C-suite. Each month will study a different enterprise C-Suite executive and in order to do a deeper dive into a particular business function.\nThe study branding is a nod to the speed at which GenAI is becoming an embedded part of business decision-making and executive proficiency. Successful businesses will be led by executives who see GenAI as the invisible engine that powers the business and who prioritize the people, process, and dollars to make it real for themselves and their customers over the next one, three and five years.\nThe CAIO\u2122 Study will methodically benchmark that journey across the enterprise C-Suite and expects to have data on more than 700 such U.S. executives in its first year.\nThe May 14th release will share what we learned after conducting a double-blind survey of a random sample of CFOs of 60 of the largest companies in the U.S. \u2014 $1 billion or more in annual revenue. For this issue of the study, we drilled into the applications of GenAI across the business, what is being invested to support those activities, and how CFOs currently measure its impact.\nStarting with the fact that not even enterprise CFOs who\u2019ve invested the most have a clear vision for how to effectively predict the impact of GenAI on the financial performance of the company in these early days.\nA Whole Lot of Writing Emails Going On\nHere\u2019s the good news: Right now, nearly all enterprise firms we studied are using GenAI to some degree.\nHere\u2019s the highly predictable news: Most of those CFOs have yet to see a demonstrable return from those investments.\nThere are a few very good reasons for that.\nFirst, the enterprise firms studied are just getting their feet wet with mostly low-risk, low-impact, less complex applications of GenAI tech.\nAnd second, those types of applications and use cases represent the bulk of their company\u2019s experiences to date with GenAI. Most of what we see so far inside of these enterprise firms is the use of GenAI to create emails, summarize reports, search for information, produce graphics and write social media posts.\nI won\u2019t ask whether the last email you sent also had a little GenAI helping hand.\nRoughly half of the GenAI use cases inside these firms can be classified this way \u2014 more routine than strategic, more for internal use than customer-facing, and mostly by individuals inside of the company to save time and improve the quality of their personal workflows.\nIt\u2019s why we also find a relationship between the number of firms using GenAI to tackle more complex activities and the impact CFOs report GenAI has on the business right now.\nOnly 14% of the CFOs in our study say that GenAI-ing routine, less complex activities deliver a positive impact on the business. It is hard to measure the collective financial and business impact of better emails and snappier reports.\nThey have a much different view when LLMs are used in broader and more strategic ways.\nMore than twice as many CFOs report a strong ROI when GenAI is applied this way, even as CFOs right now are using more gut instinct than P&L performance to judge its potential impact. Strategic activities in this study include innovating products and improving processes and workflows for mission-critical business functions such as the production process, fraud and cybersecurity.\nWe also observe a surprising disconnect between what conventional wisdom suggests as popular strategic applications of GenAI and how CFOs project their bottom-line impact today.\nFor example, chatbots are widely popular and often talked about as a GenAI use case; it\u2019s also one that CFOs say is an effective application of the tech. Yet we find roughly a third of enterprise CFOs (32%) report a negligible impact of chatbots on financial and business performance. It could be that the tech is still new and being introduced alongside people sitting in call centers, making it hard to predict its impact on business bottom line right now.\nAccording to the study, using GenAI to generate code is a less widely used case, but one that CFOs report as having 2.5 times greater impact on business performance than others. CFOs may find it easier to conceptualize GenAI\u2019s impact on the cost of supporting a development team, for example, when coding has the potential to become more widely distributed across the business.\nMore GenAI Means More Impact\nNearly every firm in The CAIO\u2122 Study uses GenAI to support an average of four routine, less complex, non-mission-critical tasks, as described earlier. Enterprise firms that use GenAI more strategically use an average of six applications across the business.\nWe also find that enterprise CFOs using six or more GenAI applications report an eightfold increase in the expected ROI impact of GenAI on the business compared to those using five or fewer. One might expect that going from four to six applications would be linked to CFOs reporting a change in ROI impact proportional to that increase. But we see that the addition of a few strategic applications can be quite impactful.\nThat\u2019s even as only one in three CFOs studied are using the technology across the business to this degree (i.e. six or more applications).\nWe also find that when CFOs have more experience using GenAI applications to support strategic business initiatives, they have a greater appetite to invest more in its strategic use. Those CFOs cite an average investment in GenAI applications at $4.6M, 88% more than those whose use cases are more routine.\nWhat Gets Managed Gets Measured, Sort Of\nNearly a year and a half after the public launch of OpenAI and Chat GPT, we find that the methods enterprise CFOs use to measure the future value of their current investments in GenAI applications are still a work in progress.\nIt is admittedly early days, and one study of a small sample of enterprise CFOs does not make a trend. But we believe that what CFOs report as the drivers of a positive ROI may also undervalue GenAI\u2019s potential business impact in the years to come. There\u2019s no data to benchmark or use as a guide right now. It is also difficult to forecast the impact across the business of such a transformative technology.\nWe already see signs of how measuring GenAI\u2019s impact might take shape. The enterprise CFOs who report that their firms have embedded GenAI into more complex, higher-value business functions also say the business and financial impact is stronger, and their reports of a positive ROI are more certain.\nThey report a more positive impact across the business in the areas of customer delivery, critical business process improvement and competitive positioning. More than three quarters (78%) of the firms who use GenAI this way count positive impacts in new product innovation, and 72% see positive impacts on market adaptability and business expansion \u2014 nearly twice as much as those who haven\u2019t expanded their GenAI wings across the business.\nSome of that can be explained by how CFOs see the staffing mix evolve over time and how it impacts the costs to support the workforce in the here and now.\nEight in ten enterprise CFOs in this study say that GenAI will have a big impact on staff mix, with nearly two thirds saying that their need for lower-skilled workers across the business has decreased at the same time the need for more analytically skilled workers has increased. CFOs have a direct line of sight into those staffing plans and forecasts, so they may be using it as a proxy for measuring business performance over the longer term.\nWe also see evidence that it is the blend of GenAI applications across both routine and strategic use cases that drives a stronger, more positive ROI outlook as reported by the enterprise CFOs we studied\nAnd why we find little evidence that any single GenAI application is the \u201csilver bullet\u201d to take the overall business performance of the largest companies in the U.S. to the next level."

      "text": "Author George Santayana famously wrote: \u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d And Mark Twain once wrote: \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\u201d\nMight we form a couplet from Enron to mark the beginning of the millennium and Wirecard to mark the end of the 2010s?\nAs things now stand, Wirecard is shaping up to be one of the biggest financial frauds in years, drawing at least some comparisons to Enron from decades past. They are different industries, to be sure \u2014 Enron made its home (and grave) in energy, and Wirecard is a payments processor. But despite the disparate verticals, some of the warning signs echo.\nRocket ship stock prices? Sure. Wirecard shares were trading at the low single-digit euros a decade ago and were at high as 200 euros in 2018. Enron shares peaked at around $90 in the summer of 2000, having started the year at about $40.\nRapidly ascending stock prices belie optimism that the horizon (and profits) remain clear for companies.\nBoth firms promised to transform their industries. Wirecard, focused on online payments, in recent years created Boon, a mobile app payment system tied to Europe, and offered WeChat Pay to European merchants as recently as this year. Enron had its fingers in everything from natural gas to internet networking.\nThe alarm bells had sounded for both firms before things unraveled. For Wirecard, the roots to greater scrutiny over what was going on behind the scenes can be traced to an early 2019 Financial Times (FT) article that said the company had forged documents connected to Wirecard\u2019s Asian business in a bid to mislead regulators.\nLater coverage in the year reported that results at subsidiaries had been inflated. The New York Times noted on June 26 that stock research services targeting short sellers (who bet that prices will decline) had been signaling that Wirecard was a \u201chouse of cards.\u201d\nThen the swift downturn \u2014 and insolvency. Enron filed for bankruptcy in 2001 after accounting improprieties surfaced; much of the company\u2019s business activities \u2014 logged as revenues and profits \u2014 had been done though special purpose entities (where it had ownership interests). Wirecard, according to FT in February 2019, had engaged in \u201cround tripping.\u201d Under that activity, the paper reported, money would leave Wirecard\u2019s bank owned in Germany, \u201cshow its face on the balance sheet of a dormant subsidiary in Hong Kong, depart to sit momentarily in the books of an external \u2018customer,\u2019\u201d then travel back to Wirecard\u2019s India operations to be booked as revenue.\nMost recently, Wirecard has said that roughly $2.1 billion account balances that cannot be traced \u201cdo not exist.\u201d\nThe story still has legs, of course, as in recent weeks the Philippines central bank said there were no signs the $2.1 billion had been deposited in the first place. The banks cited \u2014 BDO Unibank Inc. and BPI \u2014 had been used to \u201cmislead\u201d investigators, according to the central bank.\nElsewhere as noted by The New York Times, independent research provider The Analyst, based in London (and where founding partner Mark Hiley branded Wirecard a \u201chouse of cards\u201d) raised questions about Wirecard acquisitions of merchant acquirers and the financial performance of those acquisitions.\n\u201cWhen you looked at the local companies\u2019 financial filings, you could see they were very small businesses, with very low revenue and limited profitability,\u201d Hiley said, as quoted in the Times. \u201cWe were concerned: Why were they paying so much money for these small, barely profitable companies?\u201d\nAnd now Wirecard has filed for insolvency due in part to \u201cover-indebtedness\u201d as loans worth a cumulative 1.3 billion euros ($1.46 billion) come due as of July 1.\nIn some ways, at least in this tale of two spectacular rises and falls stretching across 2000 and 2020, history may not have repeated itself, but it sure has some familiar echoes.\nEven if they don\u2019t rhyme."

      "text": "It\u2019s happened again.\nWells Fargo on Thursday (May 17) was facing accusations that its employees altered customer data, this time in a business banking unit, according to The Wall Street Journal. The paper, citing unnamed sources, reported that bank employees \u201cimproperly altered information on documents related to corporate customers.\u201d\nThere is no evidence that any data involved creating fictitious accounts for retail consumers, as was the case in the scandal from about two years ago. Rather, employees in the bank\u2019s wholesale unit reportedly added or altered, without customer knowledge, information that ranged from \u201csocial security numbers to addresses to dates of birth for people associated with business-banking clients,\u201d the report said.\nThe behavior under investigation took place in 2017 and early 2018 \u201cas Wells Fargo was trying to meet a deadline to comply with a regulatory consent order related to the bank\u2019s anti-money-laundering controls,\u201d The Wall Street Journal said. \u201cThe employees were also working to get documents in order prior to new requirements from another regulator for disclosures related to proof of beneficial ownership of businesses.\u201d\nThe bank reportedly has told the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency about the problem in the wholesale unit. Wells Fargo\u2019s business banking serves organizations with annual sales that range from $5 million to $20 million. The bank\u2019s shares were down about 1.8 percent by late Thursday afternoon.\nWells Fargo offered no detailed comment about the matter. \u201cThis matter involves documents used for internal purposes,\u201d the bank said in a statement. \u201cNo customers were negatively impacted, no data left the company, and no products or services were sold as a result.\u201d\nWells Fargo is still dealing with the aftermath of its employees opening fake accounts for customers to meet aggressive sales targets. The bank has agreed to a $1 billion settlement with two of its regulators and has absorbed Federal Reserve sanctions. Trying to move past the controversy and brighten its image, the bank recently said income from deposit service charges would decline in 2018 \u2014 the result of what the financial institution called \u201ccustomer-friendly\u201d changes that will lead to less revenue from overdraft fees.\nThat\u2019s on top of the 20 million texts and emails that Wells Fargo sends each month to customers to warn them about low account balances, and the recent TV ad campaign designed to ensure consumers that the bank has learned from its mistakes.\nThis new Wells Fargo controversy comes after the bank hired Amanda Norton, a former JPMorgan Chase executive, as its new chief risk officer, a job she reportedly starts this summer. As well, \u201cWells Fargo is rolling out a new risk-management framework designed by a consultant after regulators informally disapproved of previous plans,\u201d the WSJ said."

      "text": "Study Finds Uncertainty Costs Middle-Market Firms 4.4% of Revenue on Average\nMarch 2024\nMiddle-market businesses operate in an economic landscape marked by heightened uncertainty. Firms on the smaller end of the middle-market spectrum face the brunt of this unpredictability. This analysis, the first in PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s new \u201c2024 Certainty Project,\u201d examines the economic impact of uncertainty on these businesses, revealing essential insights for any business leader seeking to understand how to navigate dynamic market conditions. This monthly project rotates through CFOs, heads of payment and heads of operation to monitor trends and sentiment across the operation of United States firms with revenues between $100 million and $1 billion.\n\u2022 47% of CFOs from smaller middle-market firms face considerable levels of uncertainty, and they are more than twice as likely to face this as the largest middle-market firms.\n\u2022 35% of middle-market firms say uncertainty led to missed opportunities last year.\n\u2022 CFOs that identify excess inventory costs as the biggest source of uncertainty report that more than 6% of annual revenue \u2014 or $33 million \u2014 was lost.\nGet Unlimited Access\nComplete the form below for free, unlimited access to all our Data Studies, Trackers, and MonitorEdge reports.\nThank you for registering. Please confirm your email to view all our Trackers.\nThe larger the firm, the greater the sense of certainty. That is what CFOs from smaller U.S. firms with revenues between $100 million and $250 million suggest. These CFOs grapple with greater levels of uncertainty than their larger counterparts with revenues between $750 million and $1 billion. With eyes on the bottom line, CFOs at larger firms feel they have the resources needed to meet organizational growth and innovation goals. Fifty-seven percent of the largest middle-market companies say they operate at high levels of certainty.\nThis difference is not just theoretical but has tangible financial implications. CFOs credit an average total cost of $21 million to uncertainty in the last year alone. For CFOs with $1 billion in revenue, that $21 million represents a roughly 2% marginal loss, an amount that could be insubstantial for some or deadly for firms with tight profit margins.\nFor a CFO overseeing significantly less revenue, that $21 million will represent an even worse loss. These costs underscore uncertainty\u2019s acute impact on everyday operations and strategic decision-making across what many consider the \u201creal\u201d economy.\nIn this environment, customer demand behaviors rank alongside supply chain integrity as leading sources of uncertainty, affecting 33% and 32% of surveyed CFOs, respectively. These challenges come with concerns about competitive positioning, painting a picture of a sector constantly adapting to evolving market dynamics.\nThe concerns of middle-market CFOs represent a crucial barometer of the current business climate in the U.S., offering a look into how companies strategize to stay afloat and thrive despite the steady fog of uncertainty.\nThis year, perhaps the most significant hurdle for middle-market CFOs is a nagging sense of economic uncertainty \u2014 deeply felt but not evenly distributed across revenue areas. PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s data paints a stark picture: 47% of CFOs from smaller firms \u2014 those with revenues of $100 million to $250 million \u2014 face considerable uncertainty. This share is more than twice the 21% faced by CFOs operating in the largest income bracket of $750 million to $1 billion.\nThese are just some of the findings in \u201cThe 2024 Certainty Project: Measuring the Cost of Uncertainty on Middle-Market Businesses,\u201d the first release of the PYMNTS Intelligence 2024 Certainty Project. This monthly project rotates through CFOs, heads of payment and heads of operation to monitor trends and sentiment across areas of operation for U.S. firms with revenues between $100 million and $1 billion. This edition looks at the core sources of uncertainty and some of the solutions CFOs have used to address them. The report draws on results from a survey of 60 CFOs at companies with annual revenues between $100 million and $1 billion in 2023. PYMNTS Intelligence conducted this survey from Feb. 12 to Feb. 21.\nThe Economics of Small Business\nSmaller firms often benefit from flexibility and agility, which allow them to adapt quickly to market changes. However, their heightened vulnerability to supply chain disruptions and demand fluctuations counterbalances this advantage. Their relatively lower bargaining power with suppliers and in contract negotiations can lead to higher operational costs and thinner profit margins, challenging their competitive stance. Furthermore, smaller companies usually have a limited range of products or services. These firms often rely more heavily on a single product line or market. This lack of diversification places them at greater risk from shifts in consumer preferences, economics and industry-specific trends, making it harder to weather market volatilities.1\nCustomer Demand Challenges Top CFO Concerns\nThe average cost of uncertainty for middle-market CFOs is 4.4% of revenue, or $21M.\nIn the past 12 months, these companies have felt the financial strain of economic uncertainty. These CFOs report that this has cost their organizations an average of $21 million. However, CFOs credit greater costs to specific types of uncertainty. The most significant factor behind this cost is the unpredictability of customer demand. This includes factors such as contract and inventory management, product availability and new business acquisition. Middle-market firms citing these factors as their biggest sources of uncertainty report a loss of $41 million on average \u2014 7% of revenue. Firms whose biggest source of uncertainty was supply chain challenges lost an average of $11 million, or 3.8% of revenue.\nPYMNTS Intelligence also tracked the fallout of uncertainty \u2014 and its residual costs. Middle-market firms that cited unpredictability\u2019s most significant impact as experiencing missed opportunities saw losses of $17 million. Those citing reduced profit margins as the end result reported losses of $33 million, on average. Those struggling mainly with excess inventory costs reported a 4.8% loss of annual revenue, a $17 million hit.\nUncertainty Clouds Middle-Market Outlook\nOne-third of middle-market companies in the U.S. say they operate in a highly uncertain environment.\nMiddle-market companies continue to navigate substantial unpredictability, which impacts their decision-making and planning. More than two-thirds of CFOs say they operate with a low to middle sense of certainty. Key areas affected by this include customer demand and inventory management, supply chain integrity and competitive positioning.\nNotably, 56% of CFOs who cited competitive position as one of their top sources of uncertainty identified speed to market as the biggest driver. This suggests that even in an uncertain business environment, business leaders must understand their market and their customers and have systems in place to predict demand with less error.\nUncertainty Takes a Financial Toll\nA lack of timely data causes uncertainty. It is also why twice as many CFOs use AI and data analytics over process automation to reduce it.\nMiddle-market CFOs have tried numerous strategies to wade through the current economy. In particular, three-quarters relied on data collection and analytics to guide their decision-making and reduce unpredictability in the last year. This approach is significantly more common than process automation, for example, with 75% of middle-market CFOs using analytics but just 44% turning to process automation. In particular, 63% of firms have turned to using analytics to predict customer demand behavior. To compare, 72% have used trend forecasting to reduce uncertainty in their competitive position, such as speed to market.\nIn addition, CFOs are using various strategies to bolster predictability in accounts receivable (AR). These strategies include hiring personnel, training personnel, upgrading software and using process automation, with 25% of CFOs citing each as an action taken in the month before the survey. Overall, 55% of CFOs report hiring employees with specific skill sets to address challenges and reduce uncertainty in business performance.\nThese efforts reflect a broader idea that managing uncertainty is not just a process challenge but hinges on the availability and effective use of data. By using analytics for forecasting urgent trends, CFOs at these middle-market firms report better predictability in their operations.\nData Analytics Driving Better Forecasts\nCFOs that used analytics for forecasting see better decision-making predictability 90% of the time.\nMiddle-market companies have taken a clear turn to analytics for forecasting and software upgrades. This shift has improved predictability, seeing positive results in 94% of cases. While using technology has been beneficial, relying solely on data collection has not been a foolproof strategy. Collecting data improved predictability in 67% of instances, showing that data alone is necessary, but not enough to navigate uncertainty successfully. This brings out a challenge:\nAll the same, the pursuit of quality advice \u2014 in other words, sound anecdata \u2014 also presents a mixed bag to CFOs. Securing informal insight from professional networks, a commonly used strategy, helped handle uncertainty roughly 60% of the time. Still, in several instances, the situation was worse for some CFOs. This shows CFOs\u2019 must assess and apply advice to suit their specific situations, especially in times of uncertainty.\nLooking ahead, roughly 52% of middle-market CFOs are hopeful about improved certainty levels in the next year. However, firms with an annual revenue of between $250 million and $400 million remain uneasy. A significant portion of these firms expect increased uncertainty, likely due to the higher costs of uncertainty for this revenue bracket. Middle-market CFOs in this lower revenue bracket see the highest costs of uncertainty, at 7.1% of their revenue.\nConclusion\nThe \u201c2024 Certainty Project\u201d sheds light on the business impact of economic uncertainty within the middle market. Though the overall picture is complex, a clear trend emerges among smaller middle-market companies that feel the pinch most acutely. CFOs in this segment report higher levels of unpredictability than larger companies that experience greater relative stability. This gap suggests an uneven investment in data and analytic tools across the middle market, leaving some firms unable to tackle these challenges.\nUncertainty can lead to significant losses. The average middle-market company lost $21 million in the past year, according to their CFOs. However, some unpredictable costs cause more damage. This includes fluctuating customer demand, which is linked to an average cost of $41 million. Challenges can also extend to supply chains, competition and speed to market. In response, CFOs are turning to data analytics and software upgrades to weather this successfully. While these strategies show promise, relying on informal networks has mixed results, showing the need for careful planning and execution.\nMethodology\n\u201cThe 2024 Certainty Project: Measuring the Cost of Uncertainty on Middle-Market Businesses,\u201d is the first edition of the PYMNTS Intelligence Certainty Project. This monthly project monitors trends and sentiment across operations in larger middle-market firms and small enterprise companies with revenues between $100 million and $1 billion. Each month rotates through CFOs, heads of payment and heads of operation to best capture the sources and costs of unpredictability and the strategies the C-suite uses to help weather complex and dynamic business environments.\nIn this issue, we examine core sources of uncertainty and some of the solutions CFOs have used to address it. The report draws on results from a survey of 60 CFOs of companies with annual revenues between $100 million and $1 billion in 2023. Ninety-seven percent of the businesses have been in operation for 10 years or more, with just 3% in operation between five and 10 years. The survey was taken from Feb. 12 to Feb. 21.\nPYMNTS Intelligence is a leading global data and analytics platform that uses proprietary data and methods to provide actionable insights on what\u2019s now and what\u2019s next in payments, commerce and the digital economy. Its team of data scientists include leading economists, econometricians, survey experts, financial analysts and marketing scientists with deep experience in the application of data to the issues that define the future of the digital transformation of the global economy.

      "text": "This incident \u2014 which centered on a 32-minute delay in the release of preliminary payroll employment data on Aug. 21 \u2014 was caused by an IT issue, by staff having to load the data manually and by a lack of BLS policy about how to respond to public inquiries, according to information provided to PYMNTS by a Labor Department spokesman on Wednesday (Aug. 28).\nIn addition, the announcement that was delayed had been categorized as an update to a web page rather than as a \u201cnews release,\u201d so it had different protocols, according to the information. One difference is that there are several backups to ensure news releases are available on time, while there were no similar measures for updates.\nOne of the changes the BLS has made is that it will no longer differentiate between \u201cwebsite releases\u201d and \u201cnews releases.\u201d All data with an announced release time will be subject to the same protocols and safeguards.\nThe agency will also make several other changes, per the information provided. BLS will have multiple ways to distribute each data release, including via social media posts; will verify data is available to the public before responding to any public inquiries about it; and will document these activities for each data release.\nBLS will announce more actions in the coming days, according to the information provided.\nThe Aug. 21 incident sparked fresh criticism of the BLS\u2019 procedures from Wall Street firms that use the data to spot trends in the U.S. economy, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.\nIn another incident earlier this year, the agency inadvertently published some data 30 minutes early. Months before that, a BLS economist may have shared data that was not widely available with Wall Street firms, according to the report.\nThe Aug. 21 data release said that the U.S. economy employed 818,000 fewer individuals (equating to 0.5% of nonfarm employment) that what was initially reported. The data is preliminary; the final stats will be released in early 2025."

      "text": "In an echo of payments scandals past, news came this week that Jeffrey Skilling, former CEO of Enron, has been released from federal custody after a 12-year term in prison.\nAs widely reported, Skilling helmed the energy giant before it collapsed into bankruptcy at the end of 2001. He served jail time in connection with fraud and conspiracy, centered on accounting tricks that were partly used to cover financial losses. The company posted a $600 million loss, The New York Times noted this week, and wrote down shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. Founder and Chairman Kenneth L. Lay was also convicted in the scheme, but died after his trial while awaiting sentencing.\nThe Enron fraud resulted in estimated losses in the tens of billions of dollars, and relied in part on mark-to-market accounting, which inflated asset values. Special-purpose entities helped hide debt from balance sheets, but the company eventually had to restate earnings going back years.\nSeparately, among more recent developments, and as reported in the Sun Sentinel, a whistle-blower has claimed that widespread fraud was tied to purchasing fraud in Port Everglades. The claims led to investigations by a number of authorities, including the FBI and auditors. The whistle-blower, Chris Rosinski, found payments fraud that stretched back years, and possibly decades.\nInvestigators found that, in one case, a worker rang up $18,000 in charges over the course of one year, buying equipment that ranged from faucets to pipes, which were not installed at the port. Other allegations found, for example, that procurement cards were used to buy equipment from a firm that had gone out of business last year, and where receipts were still being submitted.\nSeparately in Australia, Colleen Fay Dhuga in Calgary has pleaded guilty to a $1 million scam that lasted over six years, where she stole the funds from her employer, a group of companies under the name Anderson. According to the Calgary Herald, Dhuga said \u201cI see you have discovered my gambling habit\u201d when the scam was uncovered and she was confronted. The embezzlement lasted between 2008 and 2014 when she had been acting as controller, partially by manipulating foreign exchange transactions and through corporate credit cards.\nIn Canada, as reported earlier this week, Patrick Bieleny, the former CFO of an unnamed agri-business organization, was charged with a series of fraud counts. The Edmonton police said in a statement that \u201cthe organization reportedly discovered that millions of dollars of corporate funds had been allegedly misappropriated through transfers, non-business billings and other means.\u201d The charges state that as much as $2.5 million had been defrauded between 2009 and 2015. The alleged fraud took place through transfers and non-expense billings, among other methods.\nSeparately, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that a number of verticals are finding artificial intelligence (AI) of use in finding suspect transactions within expense reports. The effort seeks to reduce manual efforts among firms, and AI offers speed and accuracy through third-party offerings.\nAmong them, AppZen has logged more than 1,000 customers using its auditing technology, which is used to examine expense reports. The company said its audits take only minutes to be completed, versus days for manual efforts \u2014 and that as much as 10 percent of expenses submitted are \u201cworth questioning,\u201d as the WSJ reported. The AI-powered offering also gathers data points from thousands of sources to check prices for goods and services that are cited in various expense reports."

      "text": "During the pandemic, they were heroes. Now, they\u2019re apparently expendable.\nIn what is becoming a pattern in healthcare, on Tuesday (July 2), Oregon Health & Science University cut a telehealth nursing unit set up in March 2020 that was once featured on its website for its service to people across the state.\nIt is a microcosm of changes in how consumers access healthcare in the post-pandemic connected economy, as telehealth trends down and AI and other virtual technologies take its place alongside a comeback in in-person doctor visits.\n\u201cI think the simplest way to say what we\u2019re seeing right now is we\u2019re observing the shriveling of telehealth 1.0,\u201d Robin Glass, president of virtual care and health navigation company Included Health told Fierce Healthcare.\n\u201cThis original model that I think came out that was really premised on this highly transactional interaction between a patient and the clinician that didn\u2019t have any elements of longitudinal care or treating that individual as a holistic person, I think we\u2019re starting to see the end of the road for that model. It has not served the patient as well as it needs to,\u201d Glass added. \u201cI think it also doesn\u2019t reflect the modern experience that consumers are getting used to in all facets of their life. And ultimately, it doesn\u2019t deliver on the kind of value that purchasers need out of their healthcare dollar.\u201d\nThis kind of sentiment has manifested itself in the marketplace, although not everyone would agree with Glass.\nTelehealth as a business model has definitely taken a step back. Amazon\u2019s pay-per-visit telehealth service and its One Medical program are now a single brand after it announced on Thursday (June 27) that it will be renamed Amazon One Medical Pay-per-visit.\nWhile it didn\u2019t specifically single out a decline in telehealth visits as the driving factor, Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, indicated that \u201cimpersonal care\u201d made it difficult for patients to make the service profitable.\nSimilar reasons were given when Walmart shuttered its telehealth venture on April 30.\nHowever, showing that not everyone has bailed on the business model and its future, Walmart sold the division to healthcare technology startup Fabric.\nFabric, which emerged from stealth in early 2023 after rebranding from Florence, has developed technology that automates clinical and administrative tasks in healthcare. The acquisition will greatly enhance Fabric\u2019s presence in the employer market. Walmart\u2019s MeMD division had been delivering virtual care services to 30,000 employers and 5 million employees, including large employers, brokers, third-party administrators and distributors.\nFabric offers a telemedicine platform for health systems, employers and payers, featuring a suite of products designed to streamline workflows for both in-person and virtual patient visits. These products range from patient intake to self-scheduling and provider documentation tools, leveraging conversational AI to enhance both provider and patient experiences while boosting operational efficiency, according to company executives.\nTechnology solutions like the ones Fabric is developing will most likely define the future of telehealth as it embraces AI and even virtual reality. Fabric has been described as a \u201ccare enablement system (that) uses AI-powered clinical intelligence and automation to triage and route patients to the most appropriate point of care based on time of day, availability, distance and disposition while streamlining treatment across virtual and in-person workflows.\u201d That hybrid approach has room for consumer choice and technology innovation.\nOne of those innovations that is expected to gain traction is holograms. Crescent Regional Hospital, located near Dallas, has introduced an innovative technology called the \u201cHolobox,\u201d a 3D system projecting a life-sized hologram of a doctor for real-time consultations. Developed by Dutch firm Holoconnects, this 86-inch-tall device requires only electricity and an internet connection.\nThe Holobox features anti-glare glass, a transparent LCD screen, hi-fi speakers and a multi-touch operating system. It can display pre-recorded or live video of doctors, enhancing patient engagement.\nIn an interview with a local Dallas TV station, Steve Sterling, Holoconnects\u2019 North American managing director, emphasized the system\u2019s capability to revolutionize patient-doctor interactions by providing real-time access to specialists, saving valuable time for doctors.\nCrescent Regional is the first U.S. hospital to adopt this technology, with plans to expand its use in rural and underserved areas. Holoconnects aims to deploy smaller, portable versions to broaden its impact."

      "text": "Relationship experts say that the honeymoon period lasts about two years. After that, the newlywed sheen wears off, and what\u2019s left is navigating the real work of building a future together. The same is now being said about GenAI.\nAlmost like clockwork, 30 months after ChatGPT broke into the mainstream, GenAI\u2019s honeymoon with the media seems to be over. Headlines now hint at disappointment, with the tech supposedly sliding into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment.\u201d The media reports that business leaders are questioning ROI, investors are anxious for profits, and a growing number of pundits suggest the technology may have peaked \u2014 all before it even got started.\nAt the same time, the same media that once portrayed OpenAI CEO Sam Altman as a generational visionary now finds him a divisive figure. His $6.4 billion acquisition of Jony Ive\u2019s design firm is being dismissed as too much Steve Jobs-ish and not enough smart strategy.\nWe\u2019re using outdated frameworks to evaluate a fundamentally different kind of innovation.\n|\nThis kind of scrutiny isn\u2019t unique to Altman nor OpenAI. History is full of founders branded \u201cdifficult\u201d for refusing to accept the status quo on their way to transformative innovation. Steve Jobs was criticized as perfectionist micromanager. Jeff Bezos as autocratic and obsessive. Travis Kalanick was reviled for his aggressive tactics in building what has become a global logistics platform. But none of them were building conventional businesses; they were building something that would compete with, change and reinvent the category.\nThe same can be said for Sam Altman and OpenAI. He isn\u2019t building just another tech startup, and OpenAI isn\u2019t just another software company. In 30 months, we\u2019ve witnessed the evolution of a platform that turned \u201cGPT\u201d into a verb and GenAI into a globally and generationally understood concept.\nIn 2023, we all Googled. In 2025, many of us now GPT \u2014 even if we aren\u2019t always using OpenAI as our conversational interface.\nYet skepticism persists.\nWhy the disconnect?\nPart of it may be that the conversation is being shaped by the wrong voices. Or that we\u2019re using outdated frameworks to evaluate a fundamentally different kind of innovation. Or perhaps we\u2019re just not looking at the data that really matters.\nRead More: Using the FIT Framework to Drive Success in a Digital 3.0 World\nIn the real world \u2014 across industries, use cases and enterprise functions \u2014 we find that GenAI is already delivering. And the people saying so aren\u2019t marketers or GenAI evangelists. They\u2019re CFOs, the ultimate guardians of corporate spending and stewards of return on investment.\nAnd at some of the biggest companies in the world.\nOut of the Mouths of the C-Suite\nOur team at PYMNTS Intelligence has been tracking the adoption of GenAI since March 2024 through The CAIO study \u2014short for \u201cChief AI Officer.\u201d The name reflects a belief that GenAI, like the internet before it, will eventually permeate every part of the enterprise and become an embedded part of activities and business processes.\nRead More: From Spark to Strategy: How Product Leaders Are Using GenAI to Gain a Competitive Edge\nSince its inception, the study has captured insights from 60 C-suite executives each month, totaling nearly 900 CFOs, COOs, and CPOs over a 14-month period. Respondents are grouped into low-, medium-, or high-impact personas depending on how they deploy GenAI \u2014 from tactical one-off tasks to enterprise-wide, strategic functions that influence business outcomes.\nThe trends are striking.\nBy December 2024, 90% of CFOs in this benchmark study reported a \u201cvery positive\u201d ROI from GenAI, up from just 26% nine months earlier. Three months later, that 90% figure held steady. And even more telling: not a single executive surveyed reported negligible ROI for four consecutive months.\nThis is not one-off optimism. This is data-proven momentum.\nCybersecurity and fraud, perhaps not surprisingly, have seen the most rapid adoption. In March 2024, just 28% of CFOs said they used GenAI for fraud detection or cybersecurity management. By December, that number jumped to 75%. In the same period, usage of GenAI to identify fraud and errors rose from 27% to 72%. More telling, the CFOs who used GenAI to support these activities found them far more impactful than simply fine-tuning around the edges of existing processes and training, even though many still cling to what was once tried and true.\nThis is not one-off optimism. This is data-proven momentum.\n|\nMore telling is that the share of organizations using GenAI in high-impact ways has doubled over the past year. The highest-ROI use cases are no longer pilot programs \u2014 they\u2019re strategic imperatives embedded deep in enterprise operations.\nAnd how CFOs evaluate ROI isn\u2019t the stuff of green-eye-shaded accountants looking to tik and tie every expense to a demonstrable point of profit on the balance sheet. Instead, it is their observation of the strategic impact of the technology on operational efficiencies and their ability to reallocate spend as a result of using it.\nAnd it\u2019s not stopping there.\nPutting Money Where the Efficiencies Are\nBy the end of 2025, enterprise spending on GenAI is expected to increase by 50%. This isn\u2019t throwing good money at a technology with eyes-closed and fingers crossed, hoping for the best. Our data show that 75% of companies are accelerating their adoption of GenAI and 78% have increased their investment in complex, enterprise-grade use cases. These C-level decision makers are redesigning core processes and infrastructure to leverage GenAI\u2019s capabilities by making it a part of how they do business.\nSurprising, even to us, is that the biggest internal company advocates are CFOs\u2014the professional skeptics we all know and love who typically say no before they say yes.\nThe biggest internal company advocates are CFOs.\n|\nAccording to our CAIO benchmarking data, 97% of CFOs said they trust GenAI to support risk management, and 98% trust it to aid in strategic decision-making. These CFOs are not using the technology to replace human judgment; they\u2019re augmenting it to help teams make faster, more confident decisions. And that is a return on their investments in both dollars and human capital.\nPerhaps the most powerful indicator of GenAI\u2019s traction is the fact that the share of CFOs reporting negligible ROI dropped from 20% in March 2024 to 0% by December. And it hasn\u2019t budged since.\nRead More: Smart Spending: How AI Is Transforming Financial Decision Making\nFrom Prompts to Auto Pilot: The Agentic Shift\nAs headlines debate whether GenAI has peaked or whether it\u2019s even worth it, the reality is that it\u2019s already evolving into the next frontier. Agentic AI is when autonomous systems operate on behalf of humans to execute complex, multi-step tasks. And it\u2019s the natural evolution of everything GenAI has enabled so far.\nDeloitte predicts that 25% of enterprises using GenAI will implement agent-based systems by the end of this year. That number is expected to double by 2027.\nThe reality is that GenAI is already evolving into the next frontier.\n|\nThe truth is that AI agents are already live in the wild \u2014 processing insurance claims, monitoring patient vitals, managing eCommerce operations and scanning for payment fraud in real time. The use cases aren\u2019t just about tomorrow. They are today.\nCommerce is an exciting application of this tech but almost surely isn\u2019t the only transformational frontier.\nRead More: Visa Gives AI Shopping Agents \u2018Intelligent Commerce\u2019 Superpowers\nAI agents that can search, compare, decide and transact, without requiring the consumer to be part of the conversation, never mind shoulder the workload, have the potential to redefine how shopping happens, for consumers and for businesses.\nRead More: When Chatbots Replace Search Bars, Who Wins at Checkout?\nWhat The Next 30 Months Could Bring\nWhat history tells us about innovation and its path is that it never happens in a straight line or exactly as the original PowerPoint decks describe. There\u2019s always the initial spike of inflated expectations, followed by the dip of disappointment when expectations and the maturity of the tech aren\u2019t always aligned, and then the long slog toward real-world adoption at scale and with profits. There are always early adopters who want to be first and are happy to put up with the frictions of something that is very new. The fast followers who wait a bit for the early potholes to get paved over and the laggards who always bring up the rear.\nGenAI isn\u2019t following the typical curve.\nIn a world where this technology transformation is moving so fast, laggards may never be able to catch up.\n|\nIt\u2019s not hamstrung by infrastructure limitations that have made prior transformative efforts slow, sloggy and buggy. It\u2019s building on the cloud, on enterprise data systems, on digital payments and on an always-connected world. That\u2019s why its trajectory is steeper, its adoption faster, its use cases more transformational and its execution happening at a quicker pace.\nPYMNTS Intelligence finds that 78% of organizations now use GenAI in at least one strategic business function \u2014 up from 55% just one year earlier. Companies know there are still hurdles: governance, trust, data integrity, training and talent. But they\u2019re willing to put in the work because the alternative is far worse.\nThe old fear of missing out has been replaced by a newer, more urgent fear: being left behind. There is growing recognition that in a world where this technology transformation is moving so fast, laggards may never be able to catch up.\nThe Honeymoon Is Far From Over\nThirty months ago, GenAI was a curiosity. A cool way to draft better emails, summarize articles, draft social posts or even write job descriptions. Today, it\u2019s the invisible engine behind enterprise transformation. It is powering decisions, protecting systems, managing risk, and in many cases, driving growth. And it is accessible to everyone.\nUnlike those who fret about how much more work needs to be done and how imperfect it still is, I continue to be amazed at how fast and how pervasive it now is in so many consumer and business interactions. The business leaders started their GenAI journeys with purpose, have built trust and continue to experiment. They began with narrow tasks and built toward broader outcomes, as our GenAI Framework depicts. They aligned their GenAI investments with strategic goals to learn the GenAI ropes.\nThe fact that just three years in, we\u2019re already having serious debates about its long-term economic and societal impact is a sign of success, momentum, scale. And permanence. Not disillusionment.\nLook no further than Google for proof. It took nearly a decade for that team to perfect the business model that turned a fledgling Stanford research project into a global advertising powerhouse. Today, Google has arguably the strongest AI research bench on the planet. That includes Nobel laureates and the team that invented the transformer architecture that underpins GenAI.\nThe critics calling this moment a trough are using the wrong lens.\n|\nAnd yet, in 2025, Google is being forced to respond, to pivot, reframe and compete with a commercial GenAI product that didn\u2019t exist three years ago.\nTo me, that\u2019s not a slowdown. That\u2019s a gauntlet being thrown down. One that has the tech giants now on their collective heels running hard to catch up. And new players emerging with new and powerful models with specialized use cases they now power. The critics calling this moment a disappointing trough are using the wrong lens. GenAI isn\u2019t just a new technology. It\u2019s not like the cloud. It isn\u2019t like mobile. It\u2019s faster. It\u2019s deeper. It\u2019s leveraging decades of digital investment while laying the groundwork for a completely different kind of operating system. One that doesn\u2019t need to first rebuild all the rails to deliver real change right now.\nSo, rather than the end of their honeymoon with GenAI, I see a lot of business leaders who would like nothing more than to live happily ever after with it."

      "text": "Brazil might be known for samba, soccer and sugar. But you can now add digital transformation to that list.\nAccording to PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s recently released landmark report \u201cHow the World Does Digital,\u201d this country with a population of 215 million has emerged as the global leader in digital engagement among its consumers.\nThe nation\u2019s success in digital innovation is underscored by the widespread use of Pix, an instant-payment app launched by Brazil\u2019s central bank in 2020. Additionally, the payment/eCommerce platform \u201cAmazon of Latin America\u201d \u2014 Mercado Libre \u2014 launched in Brazil in 1999 and is still in widespread use. This adoption is a testament to Brazil\u2019s strong digital infrastructure, with two-thirds of consumers owning smartphones and 92% having access to at least a 4G network.\nAs the report shows, there are substantial variations in the degree of digital engagement for consumers in different countries based on the average number of activity days per month across the population. The study was based on responses from 67,000 consumers in 11 countries, collected through quarterly surveys in 2023.\nThe countries surveyed include the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, Japan, Singapore and Brazil. The sample sizes were statistically representative of the population in each country, considering gender, age, income and education.\nTo measure digital engagement, the report identified 40 core activities within 11 pillars of digital life, such as banking, shopping and entertainment. Respondents indicated their engagement frequency for these activities (daily, weekly, monthly or not at all). The results were then extrapolated to estimate the number of days consumers engaged in each activity per month. This allowed for a comprehensive comparison across different demographics and countries.\nBrazil had the highest number of activity days, at 361 (12 activities per day). The U.K., which was the median country, had 276 activity days (9.2 activities per day) \u2014 77% of Brazil\u2019s score. Japan was the lowest, with just 127 activity days (4.2 activities per day) \u2014 barely one-third of Brazil and less than half of the U.K. There is a 234-day spread between Brazil and Japan and a 93-day spread between the second highest, Singapore, and the second from last, Germany.\nThe report found Brazil\u2019s digital engagement spans various activities, as it did in other countries.\nVideo streaming tops the list, with 69% of consumers engaging in it at least weekly. Mobile banking follows closely, with 63.2% participation, and mobile gaming at 62.5%. Other popular activities include music streaming (60.8%), messaging (59.7%), online banking (59.4%) and active social media use (59.3%). Additionally, a significant portion of consumers engage in watching livestreams (58.2%), checking work remotely after hours (55.3%), and passive social media consumption (55.2%).\nGenerational and income dynamics further highlight the breadth of digital engagement in Brazil.\nMillennials and Generation Z are the most digitally active, with 405 and 411 activity days per month, respectively. Generation X follows with 335 days, and baby boomers with 271 days. High-income earners lead with 456 activity days, compared to 363 for middle-income and 309 for low-income earners.\nThe digital engagement \u201cwinners,\u201d based on total activity days, vary by generation.\nFrench Gen Z users are the most active, with 464.8 activity days per month and about 15.5 activities per day. Millennials in the U.S. lead the entire generation in digital engagement, with 446.7 activity days and 14.9 activities per day. In Brazil, Gen X and baby boomers come out ahead of other countries."

      "text": "Although France checks in seventh \u2014 the first country below the median \u2014 in the recently released landmark report by PYMNTS Intelligence, \u201cHow the World Does Digital,\u201d its Gen Z segment made a bold statement.\nFrench Gen Z users are the most active, with 464.8 activity days per month and about 15.5 activities per day \u2014 the highest engagement by Gen Z in any country, our report found.\nWhile France is one of Europe\u2019s most advanced digital economies and the second-largest economy in the European Union (EU) based on GDP, the report shows moderate overall engagement outside of Gen Z users. Most people have access to high-speed internet and mobile networks. Daily activities in France heavily involve digital technology, with social media and video streaming being the most popular. Younger generations and higher income earners tend to be more digitally engaged.\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence 2024 report, \u201cHow the World Does Digital,\u201d analyzes digital engagement among 67,000 consumers across 11 countries in 2023. It reveals high participation rates with varying levels of engagement based on generation and income. Key findings highlight Brazil\u2019s leadership in digital adoption and emphasize the urgent need for global inclusive digital growth and infrastructure to bridge the digital divide.\nThe countries surveyed include the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, Japan, Singapore and Brazil. The sample sizes were statistically representative of the population in each country, considering gender, age, income and education.\nTo measure digital engagement, the report identified 40 core activities within 11 pillars of digital life, such as banking, shopping and entertainment. Respondents indicated their engagement frequency for these activities (daily, weekly, monthly or not at all). The results were then extrapolated to estimate the number of days consumers engaged in each activity per month. This allowed for a comprehensive comparison across different demographics and countries.\nWith a population of 68 million in 2022 and ranked 39th in per capita GDP, most (about 87.3%) French residents had access to high-speed broadband in 2022 and nearly all had access to at least 4G cellular networks by 2022 \u2014 45% had access to 5G. Most adults had smartphones and, in 2021, 86.3% of adults had debit cards.\nLike other countries, the report found France\u2019s digital engagement covers various activities.\nVideo streaming heads the list, with 52.3% of consumers engaging in it at least weekly. Social media (passive) trails closely, with 51.9% participation, and mobile gaming is third at 49.4%. Other popular activities include messaging (47.9%), mobile banking (43.4%) and watching a livestream (42.0%). Additionally, a significant portion of consumers engage in music streaming (40.6%), online banking (38.4%) and using a traffic-related app (37.8%).\nFrance\u2019s top five activities based on number of days consumers engage in them monthly are passive social media (13.3), video streaming (13.2), mobile gaming (13.1), messaging (12.1) and mobile banking (11.0).\nGen Z users, by far, are the most digitally active, checking in at 464.8 activity days per month and about 15.5 activities per day. Millennials are next at 378.4 followed by a considerable drop-off to Gen X at 256.1 and baby boomers at 150.0.\nHigh-income earners lead with 275.5 activity days, compared to 272.6 for middle-income, and 267.6 for low-income earners.\nFrench officials are working to enhance their digital transformation standing in Europe. To achieve the European Union\u2019s ambitious 2030 digital transformation goals, France has unveiled a comprehensive strategy, which prioritizes several key areas: Bolstering digital infrastructure, shoring up cybersecurity, and training the workforce in digital literacy.\nAdditionally, it aims to spark innovation in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, while simultaneously improving the accessibility and user experience of digital public services. This multi-pronged approach underscores France\u2019s commitment to not only economic growth and sustainability, but also achieving technological leadership and ensuring that everyone benefits from the digital revolution.\nFrance is making big improvements in its digital capabilities, bringing fast internet to more rural areas and making sure their digital systems are safe from cyber threats. It\u2019s also teaching more people how to use digital tools effectively, which helps everyone get involved. France is moving forward with innovative ideas in artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies, using them to make things better in different industries and boost the economy.\nA pivotal event occurred at the Choose France 2024 Summit: Microsoft announced a massive investment in France (4 billion euros) to boost the country\u2019s digital skills and AI development. Microsoft plans to train 1 million people and support 2,500 startups by 2027, which will help create jobs, grow the French economy and make France a leader in AI technology.\nMicrosoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said the investment shows a commitment to supporting and growing digital innovation and economic growth in France, adding: \u201cWe are building state-of-the-art Cloud and AI infrastructure, training people with AI skills, and supporting French startups as they use our technology with confidence to grow in a fair and responsible way.\u201d"

      "text": "Those who relied on February 2022 online sales data reported by the Census Bureau to adjust their business strategies or make investment decisions may have reason to be a little terrified right now.\nThat\u2019s because the revised online sales data released by Census last Thursday \u2014 May 19, 2022 \u2014 stand in sharp contrast to the data Census reported three months earlier.\nThe Details\nWhen Census released data about Q4 2021 online sales as a percentage of all retail sales in February 2022, it reported that share to be 12.9%.\nThat\u2019s substantially lower than the share would have been if the historical trend of growth in the share had continued and the pandemic had never happened: 13.7%, as I show below.\nBased on the revised data Census reported last Thursday, May 19, was Q4 2021 online sales were 14.5%, a full 1.6 percent points higher than the 12.9% Census reported in February. And at least so far, their revised data shows that online hasn\u2019t given up the boost it got from the pandemic.\nThis would be a stunning revision in the Census data at any time, but it\u2019s particularly troublesome in times of chaotic markets, when even modest negative news can send investors for the exits.\nPYMNTS\u2019 data analytics team discovered the massive revision, and its implications, when using Census data to update our own last Thursday.\nHere\u2019s the whole story.\nWhat Census Said in February 2022\nIn some sense, the February 2022 Census data was the data shock that roiled the market \u2014 at least the part of the market for which online sales are a material driver for business, market value and investor sentiment.\nThat shock came in the form of a chart (below) presented in an April 16th Wall Street Journal article using Census data to report on the impact of the pandemic on online sales growth. The chart is an \u201caccurate\u201d depiction of the inaccurate Census data that had been reported at that time.\nThat chart, using February 2022 data, showed the expected upward blip in Q2 2020 to 15.7%, then a sharp decline eventually falling to 12.9% in Q4 2021.\nEyeballing the chart makes it clear that the online share was lower than it would have been if the previous trend had just continued and the pandemic had never happened. In fact, as I\u2019ll detail below, the online share would have been 13.7 percent in Q4 2021 if the historical trend had continued without a pandemic. So, according this chart, based on the February data, the reported online share of 12.9 percent was actually lower than it would have been without the pandemic. Coming out of the pandemic apparently caused the digital transformation to go in reverse!\nBut that was before Census revised the underlying data that the February chart was based on.\nWhat Census Said in May 2022\nCensus released revised online sales data last week, May 19, 2022, as they do each quarter. When Census releases its quarterly numbers, it\u2019s not uncommon to see revisions to prior quarters. Those revisions are usually no more than 1 percent and therefore have no material impact on prior quarter reporting.\nNot this time.\nWhat the PYMNTS data team saw when using their data to update our own was a stunner.\nThe May 2022 Census data reflected an eleven-year adjustment to online sales data \u2014 back to 2011. The revisions are fairly small until Q1 2020 \u2014 and then the revisions are substantial. The data now show a revised Q4 2021 estimate of the online share of retail sales to be 14.5%.\nComparing Q4 2021 online sales of 12.9% in February 2022 and Q4 2021 online sales of 14.5% in May, that\u2019s an upward revision of 12.4 percent ((14.5/12.9)-1=.124).\nWhen Census reported their May numbers, they said nothing about the dramatic adjustment upward in the share of online sales. PYMNTS reached out to Census asking for a comment. As of the time this piece published, we have not had a response to that query.\nThe February 2022 Census data are no longer online, even though the Census press release that announced those data in February can be found here.\nReputable data aggregators used Census data to update their own charts. See this one from Statista, accessed on May 20, 2022, using Census data from February to reproduce the same chart as seen in the April 16th Wall Street Journal.\nI\u2019m also pretty sure that you can find Census\u2019 February 2022 Q4 2021 data cited in dozens of presentations across the payments and investor ecosystem too. Possibly even some of your own.\nBelieving Census Data or Your Own Eyes\nFebruary 2020 Census Data notwithstanding, a good old-fashioned gut check about what they had reported \u2014 and the doomsday predictions about the future of online commerce that followed \u2014 should have raised four very big red flags, given what they assumed or implied.\nOne: That none of the digital experiences introduced by merchants and payments providers in 2020 and 2021 would stick, even a little. To most people that I spoke with after this data was reported, it seemed implausible and nearly unbelievable. No one believed that the innovations introduced and used by consumers between 2020 and 2021 were just a big COVID band aid that they\u2019d rip completely off the second they could go back to physical stores, that none of the conveniences people became accustomed to during the pandemic would stick, that consumers would emerge from the pandemic less likely to use online than before.\nRelated: Aggregators\u2019 Growth Shows Delivery Habits Buck the Great Reopening\nTwo: That online was an all-or-nothing proposition. No one, even the most ardent online commerce enthusiasts, ever thought that consumers would completely abandon physical stores and live their lives only online. The notion that consumers would shift all of their shopping online was a false assumption, even though it is inevitable that the majority of physical interactions \u2014 shopping and almost everything else \u2014 will be enabled via a device connected to the internet at some point in the future. That\u2019s because it\u2019s already happening everywhere in the world.\nRead also: Retailers Rush to Rethink Stores Amid Shift to Digital, Experiential Shopping\nThree: That all of the data captured and presented from a variety of sources about the consumer\u2019s digital shift was off-base. The Census data also seemed antithetical to the monthly Census-balanced studies of consumers\u2019 digital behaviors that PYMNTS had been capturing and reporting since March 6, 2020. What our data showed was consumers returning to the physical world, but continuing their activities in the digital world as well: ordering ahead using their mobile devices to pickup in store, ordering groceries online yet still shopping in grocery stores for grocery items, eating out at restaurants while still ordering food from aggregators to eat at home.\nSee the study: 2022 Global Digital Shopping Index\nPYMNTS\u2019 April 2022 monthly consumer shopping data shows that 33% of consumers made retail purchases online that month, up from 29% in March 2022. This shows that eCommerce doesn\u2019t exclude shopping in the store \u2014 but in-person commerce doesn\u2019t exclude using digital channels to buy things, either.\nSee also: Digital Economy Payments: How Consumers Pay In The Digital World\nIt\u2019s what prompted me to write about it last week, using PYMNTS data to push back on what was starting to seem like conventional wisdom about the end of online and the digital transformation.\nRead more: RIP Digital Transformation, We Hardly Knew Ya\nFour: That online sales growth would suddenly stall after more than two decades of steady growth. That is despite the pandemic forcing most people to change their habits and try online solutions. As part of our analysis over the last several days, the PYMNTS data team projected what the online share would have been in Q4 2021 if the 2010-2019 trend had just continued through Q4 2021 absent the pandemic. As I stated earlier, using a simple trend line projection, we find that the online share of retail sales would have been 13.7% in Q4 2021 compared to the 12.9% based on the data Census released in February.\nIf the February Census data were correct, that would imply that online sales were 1.8 percentage points below the trend line following the two years of pandemic-caused lockdowns of the physical world.\nWhat\u2019s Next\nUsing the revised May Census numbers, PYMNTS data team shows Q1 2022 online sales as a percentage of overall retail sales at 14.3%.\nThat is 0.9 percentage points higher than the historic pre-pandemic trend.\nAt least so far, this suggests that there is some persistence to the boost online got from the pandemic. Of course, it\u2019s possible that online may give up some of that boost as the effects of the pandemic recede.\nThe May Census data revision is very important for everyone attempting to evaluate the digital transformation.\nAs of Q1 2022 online sales are up to 14.3 percent compared to 11.1 percent in Q4 2019. That\u2019s almost a third higher (although slightly down from the 14.5 percent in Q4 of 2021).\nThe pandemic appears to have given online retail sales a boost.\nAnd, that\u2019s a data-driven cause for optimism about the digital economy and the businesses that are driving it."

      "text": "It takes a lot to get most people to agree on anything.\nEven members of the same family have a hard time deciding what movie to watch on a Friday night, what to name the new puppy or what color to paint the living room. Getting consensus across an organization to move a new project forward can become painstakingly arduous \u2014 that\u2019s quite often why inertia reigns supreme.\nThere is one thing that nearly everyone agrees on. And that is the importance of protecting their financial interests.\nFinancial stability represents a fundamental human need. Whether wealthy with diversified investment portfolios or living paycheck to paycheck with financial pressures, individuals understand that safeguarding their money directly impacts their quality of life, future opportunities and sense of security. That\u2019s as true for Gen Zs living their best-connected lives at home and at work as it is for Grandma collecting Social Security and dividends still trying to figure out how to Venmo birthday money to her grandkids.\nFinancial stability is a complex calculation that goes beyond dollars and cents.\n|\nFinancial stability is also a complex calculation that goes beyond dollars and cents sitting in a bank or investment account. It\u2019s about how wealthy people feel when they look at the value of their home, how well their investments are doing and how secure they feel in their jobs. It\u2019s why preserving and growing one\u2019s economic resources remains a common priority, and source of anxiety in uncertain times \u2014 regardless of how many zeros and decimal points one\u2019s bank account balances may have.\nThat\u2019s why financial decisions often come down to the quantitative and qualitative inputs that determine how wealthy any one individual, or household, may feel at any given point in time. Taking into account their income today, their wealth and their well-being in the years to come.\nBased on brand-new, unpublished data from PYMNTS Intelligence, the financial confidence of Americans has been shaken severely. And their spending plans, present and future, are starting to show it.\nThe Not-So-Wealthy Effect\nA new report to be released by PYMNTS Intelligence next week finds that the vast majority of consumers, whether they are living paycheck to paycheck or not, are pulling back their spending. They are doing that by buying fewer things or buying cheaper products.\nThis national study of 2,820 consumers (conducted March 12-31, before the world-shaking announcements of April 2) found Americans already making the connection between tariffs and the economic pain of persistent inflation and a possible recession, even before the full impact of these policies has hit home \u2014 and their wallets.\nAnd they\u2019re not waiting around to change their buying and spending patterns.\nNearly 78 percent of both groups across all major retail categories of spend \u2014 clothes, food, health and beauty, personal services, household and tech/digital services \u2014 are rethinking what they buy and how much they are willing to spend when they do. Tech purchases, eating out and buying coffee at the local coffee shop are consistently on the chopping block, even for those who do not feel financial pressures.\nThose living paycheck to paycheck are concerned because higher prices crimp how far their paychecks can or will go. Those not living paycheck to paycheck are pulling back because they want to keep their powder dry, just in case.\nBoth groups were also probably feeling less wealthy than they did at the start of the year when the stock market took off and so did their 401(k)s. Even before the market meltdown of last week, the month of March 2025 saw the Dow down 4.2% and the S&P down 5.8%, with the market posting its worst month since March of 2022.\nYet even with this pullback, consumers weren\u2019t cutting everything. Some spending is sacred. Kids\u2019 activities top this list \u2014 parents will keep paying for soccer equipment, piano lessons and math tutoring even while cutting their own spending. Personal care services that most of us can\u2019t DIY (or shouldn\u2019t attempt) like haircuts and professional beauty services also seem resilient. These patterns show that when consumers tighten their belts, they\u2019re making emotional choices, not just financial ones.\nKeep in mind: these pullbacks were all before Liberation Day, which brought tariffs that were more extensive than widely predicted, and before the ensuing stock market crash.\nConsumers are better economic forecasters than even some of the fanciest economic models.\n|\nAfter years studying consumer behavior (especially during COVID), we\u2019ve found consumers are better economic forecasters than even some of the fanciest economic models. During the pandemic, consumer predictions of the durations of the crisis were better than the medical experts. Their spending patterns told the real story all along.\nSo, if consumers do what they say will do \u2014 and have already started to do \u2014 with their spending, the simple back-of-the-envelope math predicts a potentially gloomy outcome for the U.S. economy. That\u2019s why many market and economic experts predict slowing economic and anemic GDP growth.\nAccording to Census, U.S. retail spend was roughly $7.4 trillion over the last year, 80% of which can be attributed to consumers. The PYMNTS Intelligence data finds that 78% percent of consumers say they will cut back (buy less or buy cheaper), given the expected economic situation. Even a decrease of 2% in overall spending across that group would amount to a loss of $92 billion every year to the U.S. economy.\nIf prices increase by 10%, the PYMNTS Intelligence study finds that 18% of consumers say they will simply stop buying those items.\nThese data were collected before Liberation Day. And assumes that those consumers are still employed with wages that keep pace with inflation. There\u2019s no guarantee of either because companies could cut jobs as demand for their products and services soften, and wages might not keep up with inflation as the job market softens.\nThe Business Uncertainty Multiplier\nA consumer pullback is just one chapter of a very complex global economic story.\nAccording to a forthcoming PYMNTS Intelligence March 2025 Certainty Project Study, 25% of middle market businesses report facing high levels of uncertainty, with a staggering cost equivalent to 6% of their annual revenues.\nThe ripple effects are tangible: 32% of these businesses say they have or will miss business opportunities due to that uncertainty, 33% faced delays in getting products to market, and 31% experienced client turnover because of their own uncertain business outlooks.\nLet that sink in.\nThat\u2019s roughly a third of U.S. businesses making between $100M to $1B in annual revenue \u2014 and the integral bridge between the enterprise and smaller business supply chains \u2014 who face some sort of economic uncertainty.\nThese businesses are doing the best they can to make lemonade out of tariff lemons.\n|\nThis same study also suggests that those supply chains \u2014 having just recovered from pandemic-era disruptions \u2014 are likely to face new chaos as businesses absorb the reality of tariffs actually taking effect on every import into the U.S. and higher tariffs on goods imported by 60 important trading partners.\nAmong middle-market businesses in the consumer and industrial goods industries, an overwhelming 89% expect shortages, delays and higher costs for materials. These businesses are doing the best they can to make lemonade out of tariff lemons, with 26% stockpiling inventory and negotiating with suppliers for better prices before the full effects take hold.\nThis is coming at the same time as these businesses face growing uncertainties about their own sales and margins, making them ill-positioned to absorb much of those higher costs as Administration officials hypothesize.\nAccording to PYMNTS Intelligence research, the tariff policies that middle market businesses were expecting in March created a further crisis of confidence. Six in 10 expected higher uncertainty and planning challenges as a direct result, while 70% anticipated difficulty exporting due to retaliatory tariffs from trading partners. Overall, 38% of middle-market businesses expected negative impacts from tariffs \u2014 a figure that jumps to 53% among those in goods industries, up dramatically from 35% just a month earlier in February.\nAnd this was all before the Trump Administration announced tariffs that were higher, covering more countries and possibly more permanent than were widely expected on Liberation Day.\nWhat We Can Learn From Pinball Machines\nJust north of Boston lies Laconia, New Hampshire. Laconia is famous for two things. It is right smack in the center of New Hampshire\u2019s Lakes Region, with all four lakes touching some part of its city limits. And it is home to Funspot, the largest Arcade Center in the world, crowned the world\u2019s largest arcade in the 2008 Guinness Book of World Records.\nFunspot was established in 1952, and is home to more than 600 arcade games, many from the heyday of pinball machines and arcade games, its owners claim. The arcade industry, globally, is set to reach $21 billion by 2030, despite (and many say in spite of) the shift to video games. After all, who doesn\u2019t love a game of good old-fashioned arcade pinball?\nPinball combines skill and chance. One powerful flip sends a metal ball careening across a field of flashing lights, blaring music and unexpected drops. Players work the flippers to keep the ball in play, building momentum and points until the game ends. No two games \u2014 or players \u2014 are alike.\nEdward Lorenz was an American mathematician and meteorologist and considered the founder of modern chaos theory. His work at MIT was pathbreaking in furthering the world\u2019s collective understanding of complex systems. Those insights have been applied to fields as diverse as weather, biology, computer science and economics.\nEconomists build models to analyze tariffs\u2019 impacts, but struggle with the same challenge that makes predicting a pinball\u2019s path impossible: compounding and interdependent interactions that magnify even the smallest of initial variations.\n|\nIn his 1993 book The Essence of Chaos, Lorenz uses pinball to illustrate complex systems. He notes that tiny differences in how players launch the ball create completely different outcomes. Though the physics of the game are deterministic, the results seem random due to the presence of these small sensitivities.\nBoth pinball and economics follow set rules yet defy precise prediction. In the example of tariffs, economists build models to analyze their impacts, but struggle with the same challenge that makes predicting a pinball\u2019s path impossible: compounding and interdependent interactions that magnify even the smallest of initial variations.\nA pinball bounces off bumpers and obstacles, each collision altering its path and influencing all future movements. Similarly, tariffs trigger responses throughout the economy \u2014 consumers change habits, companies shift supply chains, trading partners retaliate \u2014 creating feedback loops that standard economic models can\u2019t capture or anticipate.\nThis is especially true in real time today, given the uncertainty of how the tariff game is going to play out. Tariffs could be gone by Easter or here through the century \u2014 or anything in between.\nNavigating the New Economic Chaos\nToday\u2019s consumers, already nervous about spending, are the first bumper in our economic pinball machine. Their pullback creates the initial ricochet that determines how badly tariffs hurt the broader economy.\nOur research consistently shows that consumers predict economic trends better than the experts. When they sense trouble \u2014 as they clearly do now with tariffs \u2014 their changes in behavior become self-fulfilling prophecies. Less spending leads to inventory pileups, less demand, then production slowdowns, then job cuts, then even less consumer spending \u2026 and down we go.\nThe lesson from pinball is clear: in complex systems, you can\u2019t control every bounce once the ball is in play. Tariffs might seem straightforward, but the economic game that follows almost defies prediction. It involves the interaction between dozens of countries, millions of businesses and billions of consumers globally \u2014 and their guesses as to what everyone else is going to do.\nThe lesson from pinball is clear: in complex systems, you can\u2019t control every bounce once the ball is in play.\n|\nConsumer spending drives nearly 70% of our economy, making it the most powerful bumper in this economic pinball game. When consumers collectively flinch \u2014 as our data shows they already are \u2014 the economic ball can careen in wild and dangerous directions.\nThe $92 billion consumer pullback we\u2019ve calculated, based on the March expectations, is just the first bounce. But if the current tariff situation proceeds as outlined, the direct and indirect effects have the potential to impact every single person and every single business in the world.\nAnd unlike arcade pinball, this economic game affects real families, real jobs and real communities. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.\nYet even as economic headwinds gather, there are compelling reasons for optimism \u2014 or at least not descent into deep pessimism. Throughout our nation\u2019s history, periods of economic challenge have consistently sparked innovation, adaptation and renewal. Let\u2019s hope there is the collective will to course correct and play through the storm."

      "text": "The move is a key element of CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s vision for the future evolution of Meta, where advertising remains the core revenue driver, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday (June 2).\nThe development could potentially benefit small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), which represent a large portion of Meta\u2019s advertisers and often lack the resources for extensive ad creation efforts, the report said.\nHowever, some larger retail brands have expressed caution regarding potentially ceding more control to Meta, amid concerns that AI-generated content may not consistently achieve the quality or specific aesthetic of human-made campaigns, per the report. AI tools sometimes produce distorted visuals that need to be refined, for example.\nThe new AI tools represent an expansion of Meta\u2019s offerings, which primarily allow generating variations of existing ads or making minor adjustments. The company intends to enable brands to develop advertising concepts entirely from scratch, according to the report.\nThe proposed workflow involves brands providing a product image and a budgetary goal, after which the AI system would generate a complete ad, including imagery, video and text. The system would also determine optimal targeting for Facebook and Instagram users and suggest budget allocations, the report said.\nMeta also plans to incorporate AI-powered personalization, allowing users to see different versions of the same ad in real time based on factors such as geolocation, per the report.\nAI-driven content creation is competitive, with Google, for example, releasing tools such as Veo for video generation, per the report. Many brands use third-party tools like Midjourney and OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E for creating ad content across digital platforms, including Meta\u2019s. Meta is looking for ways to integrate such third-party capabilities into its own platform.\nThe company\u2019s move into AI ad generation follows a reorganization of Meta\u2019s AI team. The company announced last month that it is splitting the team into two groups, with one focusing on AI products and the other focusing on foundational AI technology.\nThe reorganization aims to streamline operations and clarify responsibilities. It came as Meta faces challenges attracting top AI talent after losing several researchers to French AI startup Mistral.\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."

      "text": "One week before, PYMNTS fielded our first in a series of more than 10 bi-weekly national studies of U.S. consumers about the impact of this global pandemic on how they worked, traveled, shopped, bought food and spent their leisure time. What we found was a consumer that was already nervous and already practicing their own social distancing by reducing the level of activity in the physical world. They weren\u2019t going out to eat as much, or to the physical store to buy things as much, or traveling for work or pleasure as much, or even going to the office to work as much. We saw the first signs of the massive digital shift to come take shape.\nOne week later, many governors across the country made decisions to shut down the physical economy. On March 17, PYMNTS began to conduct bi-weekly studies across a national sample of Main Street SMBs, the collection of businesses on the main streets and side streets of communities across the country, to understand the impact of the pandemic on their businesses. What we found was a Main Street SMB sector that was floundering and ill-prepared to deal with the loss of their daily foot traffic all at once. Then, 40 percent of those businesses said that they doubted their ability to survive the pandemic.\nOver the course of these studies, we have studied more than 14,000 consumers and more than 1,500 Main Street SMBs. These studies serve as a timeline of sorts, documenting the impact of the pandemic on U.S. consumers and SMBs. Each time our studies came out of the field, I shared my own insights around the digital shift in how consumers changed how they work, shop, shop for food, eat, travel and spend their leisure time \u2013 as well as the struggles of the Main Street SMB to stay afloat.\nWe think our work has been a bellwether of the pandemic\u2019s impact on that shift to digital \u2013 and why it occurred.\nEarly on, we surfaced the fact that consumers were prioritizing their own health \u2013 and not their jobs or their financial wealth \u2013 in making decisions about doing business in the physical world. And that the only thing that would give them the confidence to reemerge was a vaccine.\nEarly on, we identified a consumer and a Main Street SMB that didn\u2019t think recovering from the pandemic would take a couple of weeks or even a couple of months. Less than a month ago, we found a consumer who, for a variety of reasons, had added 53 days to their own recovery timetable, now reaching early Q1 of 2021. Main Street SMBs share that sentiment.\nEarly on, we identified the massive shift to digital in categories like grocery and food delivery, which pre-pandemic were still quite nascent. Using statistical analyses, we also identified four consumer digital personas that offer new insight about whose digital habits might stick, where and why.\nWe also found a Main Street SMB that got a cash flow lifeline from PPP funds, which may still not be enough, and a huge incentive to embrace digital as a way to turn what was essentially zero sales to something that could help keep their businesses open and operating, even at the margin. At the same time, we found a Main Street SMB that wants to go back to business as mostly usual once the pandemic passes, even though they have embraced new digital methods. A restaurant operator still wants her restaurant to be one that largely welcomes patrons for a pleasant dining experience, even though takeout and delivery got her over the hump during the darkest days of the pandemic.\nAt nearly the halfway point of the year, the pandemic has topped 10 million cases, with roughly 500,000 deaths. The U.S. has crossed 2.5 million cases with more than 125,000 deaths. We have seen how the pandemic has accelerated the shift to digital across every facet of our economy, compressing years of progress into just three months.\nSo, as we reflect on what the rest of 2020 has in store \u2013 and the implications of the pandemic on how consumers live, work, shop, pay, eat and spend their leisure time \u2013 we thought it useful to put all of those insights into one place, to reflect on that real-time journey that consumers and Main Street SMBs have also taken, and to offer perspective on the role that each of us plays in bringing what I call \u201cDigital 3.0\u201d to life. A Digital 3.0 world that we believe will take longer than we think to fully form, despite covering so much important ground in just the last 90 days.\nStay safe and well.\nClick here to download our free report."

      "text": "A couple of weeks ago, more than 123 million people tuned in to watch the Super Bowl. Analysts say that it was the most watched program ever \u2014 thanks, in part, to Taylor Swift. Armchair spectators came for the ads and the Super Bowl halftime show while Swifties came with hopes for cutaways to Taylor cheering on Number 87. The football enthusiasts who came for the game watched intently for the outcome of the Super Bowl Coin Toss before the players even took the field.\nFootball mythology says the winner of the coin toss has an edge in deciding field and receiving preferences, and so more likely to walk away with the Lombardi Trophy. Data would disagree. Of the last 58 Super Bowls, only 27 times did a team win both the coin toss and the NFL Championship.\nMore than half of the time, to the other side of the coin went the Super Bowl victory, so to speak.\nThat brings me to grocery shopping, payments and BNPL, where the other side of the coin is an oft-overlooked part of the narrative.\nBNPL\u2019s Other Side of the Grocery Payments Coin\nThe other side of the coin is an idiom originally adapted by W.B. Yeats in 1904 from a 500-year-old military phrase describing the opposite side of the metal badges worn on their uniforms. Today, the \u201cother side of the coin\u201d is shorthand for the opposite side of an issue, topic of conversation or outcome.\nIt is also a fitting way to frame the conversation about how consumers pay for groceries, and in particular, how they use Buy Now, Pay Later programs when doing that.\nCritics, including regulators, decry the consumer\u2019s use of Pay-in-Three or -Four plans for grocery shopping. Letting consumers buy food on credit exploits a desperate consumer just to create sales, they say. A consumer who uses credit to buy food, they add, suggests a financially constrained consumer at risk of creating a cascading cycle of debt for consumables.\nBut what if I told you that nearly a third, 31%, of all U.S. consumers used a traditional credit card to make their latest grocery purchase \u2014 including those who used a digital wallet with a credit card registered as their primary funding source? And that share of consumers has remained almost constant since December 2021?\nOr that higher-income consumers \u2014 those earning over $100,000 a year \u2014 were 26% more likely to have used a credit card installment plan than lower-income consumers who used a BNPL provider to buy food?\nAnd that only 5.4% of low-income consumers and 6.5% of the population overall used a Buy Now, Pay Later product from a FinTech to pay for groceries in the past year?\nIn other words, roughly 95% of consumers only paid for their groceries using debit cards, credits cards or cash.\nThat would make the other side of the coin in the grocery payments conversation something like this:\nFour and a half times as many consumers used a credit card in their most recent grocery transaction as the number of consumers who used a BNPL program over the entire year to put food on the table at home.\nMany credit card users take longer than 30 days to pay off their debt and must pay interest. Fed Data finds that 45% of credit card accountholders revolve their balances \u2014 balances that might include grocery purchases. BNPL consumers pay for those purchases in three or four installments usually within a four to six week window, sometimes before a consumer using a credit card gets their monthly statement.\nWhen the data does the talking, it\u2019s not clear that consumers using this alternative credit product are any different, or using it any differently, than any other consumer who uses a credit card to pay for the groceries in their basket at checkout.\nThe Devil in the Grocery Data\nConsumers have probably been using credit cards to pay for groceries for as long as there have been credit cards and acceptance of those cards at grocery stores. We just never talked about it because there was never any reason to make it a topic of conversation.\nThe line of credit that consumers are given by their issuer lets them purchase whatever they want with it as long as those purchases are in compliance with card network rules. That means that everything from groceries to games to green shirts to gardening supplies and that special trip to the Grenadines can be purchased using credit cards, provided there is an available credit line.\nThe ability to earn rewards on purchases made on credit cards is an incentive to use them, with 67 percent of consumers citing rewards as a reason to use those cards for grocery purchases, according to PYMNTS Intelligence. That rises to 80% for consumers not living paycheck to paycheck. Part of the appeal of using credit card installment options to pay for any purchase, including food to be eaten at home, is the ability to rack up rewards or cash back for those purchases, with the added value of spreading out payments over time.\nEighty percent of consumers who used any type of installment to make grocery purchases report doing so as a convenient way to manage their monthly spend and pay bills. Consolidating everyday spending on a single card for one payment at the end of the month makes it easier for consumers to track, pay and finance, as necessary, while simultaneously earning rewards on those purchases.\nAnother incentive, consumers say, is the ability to use someone else\u2019s money for free for thirty days \u2014 47% of consumers who use any type of credit when buying groceries cite that as a reason they do. That\u2019s true for consumers who say they live paycheck to paycheck and those who say they do not.\nConsumers who use BNPL get the benefit of spreading grocery payments over three or four installments over a similar four to six week period. Getting the use of the BNPL provider\u2019s money, for free, over that period is enough of a reward for many consumers.\nEspecially when everyone across every income level feels the persistent pinch of food inflation.\nGroceries Paid for Over Time\nEven though the monthly rate of inflation has declined dramatically over the last 12 months to roughly 3.1%, overall prices have increased by 18% since January 2021. According to the latest CPI data, the cost of food is 20.9% higher in 2024 than it was in 2020. That\u2019s why the crowing about reduction in monthly CPI continues to fall on deaf consumer ears. It\u2019s their grocery store receipts that consumers look at when they say their wages have not kept pace with inflation.\nAccording to PYMNTS Intelligence research, consumers across all income levels report cutting back on discretionary purchases or trading down to cheaper brands because of the impact of food inflation on their monthly purchasing power.\nFour times more consumers said they cut back on all non-essential spending because of the high cost of food than said they felt no impact. Four in ten consumers who report not living paycheck to paycheck said they cut back on discretionary purchases, too \u201418% more than said they felt no impact.\nHalf of consumers earning more than $100,000 said they cut back, too, and more middle income (64%) than lower income (61%) said they had less to spend on anything but the essentials. Many of the paycheck-to-paycheck consumers with issues paying bills (68%) as well as those who say they do and can pay bills (61%) report increasingly making the tradeoff to put food in their grocery shopping carts rather than buying a nice-to-have item they\u2019d want but don\u2019t really need.\nAlthough BNPL for groceries is scrutinized, data reveals it as part of a broader trend of credit use for essential spending, particularly for those who feel the strongest effects of food inflation. The distinctions between BNPL and traditional credit cards blur when considering their shared role in facilitating consumer spending amidst challenging economic times.\nThe Other Side of the BNPL Grocery Coin\nAlthough the motivations driving the use of any form of credit at the grocery store may be different, the data shows that the value provided to consumers is similar. Today, there are just different credit products that consumers without access to as many credit options can use, responsibly, and pay in full over roughly the same period as a credit card user who pays their balance in full.\nMany of those options have been introduced by FinTechs who have since expanded acceptance of their credit option to any merchant that accepts Visa or Mastercard. Virtual debit cards give BNPL users an opportunity to turn any qualifying purchase into a Pay-in-Three or -Four payment plan. That is how and why splitting grocery store purchases over equal monthly installments became a popular BNPL use case.\nYet as popular as BNPL has become, the incidence rate of consumers using those products remains quite low.\nPYMNTS Intelligence data finds only 15 million people, 6.5% of the U.S. population, report using BNPL to pay for groceries in the last 12 months to manage their weekly and monthly food spending.\nA tiny portion of all grocery shoppers and adult consumers.\nThe relevant question, then, is whether there is any difference between a consumer using a BNPL product to split a $350 grocery purchase in three or four installments and a consumer who puts a $350 grocery basket from Whole Foods on a credit card to pay in full 30 days later.\nThe data seems to suggest that BNPL is simply a modern adaptation of credit in the evolving landscape of consumer finance."
