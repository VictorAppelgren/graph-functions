  "content": "Bad news if you rely on Microsoft\u2019s Lens: PDF Scanner app for your PDF scanning needs. The company has announced that the app will be discontinued in the coming months, and is recommending users switch to its Copilot app instead.\n\nYesterday, Microsoft announced that it will be \u201cretiring the Microsoft Lens mobile app for iOS and Android in a phased approach starting September 15, 2025\u201d.\n\nAccording to the company, it will disable new installs of the app in mid-October, and will remove the app from the App Store and google\u2019s Play store in mid-November.\n\nThen, in December, \u201cusers will no longer be able to create new scans\u201d in the app, effectively rendering it useless, except for accessing the app\u2019s MyScans folders,\n\nAs a replacement, Microsoft recommends users turn to its 365 Copilot app, \u201cwhich offers similar functionality.\u201d It also says that \u201cscans saved to OneDrive will be accessible via the MyCreations section in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app\u201d.\n\nAs noted by BleepingComputer, the Microsoft 365 Copilot app doesn\u2019t currently offer a perfect replacement for Microsoft Lens: PDF Scanner, as it still lacks a few key features:\n\n\u201cThe company advised Microsoft Lens users to switch to the Microsoft 365 Copilot app, which supports most of its features but does not allow them to save scans directly to OneNote, Word, or PowerPoint, or scan business cards to save them to OneNote. Additionally, the Microsoft 365 Copilot app doesn\u2019t provide read-out-loud functionality or Immersive Reader integration. However, the company pledged to continue adding new features and improving its current capabilities.\u201d\n\nDid you use the Microsoft Lens: PDF Scanner? Do you have a good alternative?

      "text": "Microsoft announced that it will phase out the Microsoft Lens PDF scanner app for Android and iOS devices starting in September.\nMicrosoft Lens (formerly known as Office Lens) can convert images into PDF, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel files, and it is capable of scanning both printed and handwritten text. Currently, the app has been downloaded 50 million times on the Google Play Store (with over 952,000 reviews with an average of 4.9/5 rating) and received nearly 136,000 ratings on Apple's App Store.\nAccording to Microsoft's timeline, the retirement process will begin in mid-September, with new Apple App Store and Google Play Store installs to be disabled one month later.\nStarting in mid-November, Microsoft Lens will be removed from app stores. Users who still have it installed will no longer be able to create new scans after mid-December 2025.\n\"This change affects users of the Microsoft Lens mobile app on iOS and Android. After December 15, 2025, users will no longer be able to create new scans in the app,\" Redmond said in a Thursday message center note.\n\"Existing scans will remain accessible in the app's MyScans folder, but this functionality will no longer be supported. Users can continue scanning using the Microsoft 365 Copilot app, which offers similar functionality. Scans saved to OneDrive will be accessible via the MyCreations section in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app.\"\nThe company advised Microsoft Lens users to switch to the Microsoft 365 Copilot app, which supports most of its features but does not allow them to save scans directly to OneNote, Word, or PowerPoint, or scan business cards to save them to OneNote.\nAdditionally, the Microsoft 365 Copilot app doesn't provide read-out-loud functionality or Immersive Reader integration. However, the company pledged to continue adding new features and improving its current capabilities.\nMicrosoft Lens is one of several apps and services that Redmond announced will be killed since the start of the year.\nFor instance, in May, Microsoft notified Microsoft Authenticator users that the app's password autofill feature would be deprecated in July and advised users to switch to Microsoft Edge instead, after giving them until August 1st to export their passwords before they became unavailable in the app.\nTwo months earlier, the company published guidance for Microsoft Publisher users, alerting them that the desktop publishing application would no longer be supported and would be removed from Microsoft 365 after October 2026.\nOne year ago, Microsoft also said that the Windows Paint 3D graphics app would be discontinued and removed from the Microsoft Store in November 2024.\nRed Report 2025: Analyzing the Top ATT&CK Techniques Used by 93% of Malware\nMalware targeting password stores surged 3X as attackers executed stealthy Perfect Heist scenarios, infiltrating and exploiting critical systems.\nDiscover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?
