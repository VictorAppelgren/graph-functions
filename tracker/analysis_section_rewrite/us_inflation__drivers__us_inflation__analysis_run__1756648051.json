      "feedback": "The draft is on‑target for DXY but needs tightening and full source backing. 1) **Add explicit citations** for every quantitative claim: the 0.5–1 % upside, the 200 bp downside, the 57 bp steepening, the 30 bp flattening, the 2.5 % CPI threshold, and the 3 % PCE trigger. 2) **Clarify the causal chain** by quantifying the term‑premium lift: e.g., “Fed cut → 2‑yr/10‑yr spread compresses 30 bp → 10‑yr yield rises 10–15 bp → dollar yield advantage increases 5–7 bp → DXY up 0.5–1 %.” 3) **Remove drift**: any mention of “US 2Y Treasury Yield” or “US 10Y Treasury Yield” must be tied to a source ID or omitted; keep the focus on DXY. 4) **Condense language**: replace “the primary risk is a Fed policy rev” with a clear risk statement and ID. 5) **Add a concise watch‑list**: (a) Aug 30 PCE, (b) Aug 31 NFP, (c) Aug early CPI, (d) Sept Fed meeting minutes, (e) 2‑yr/10‑yr spread. 6) **State the horizon** explicitly: “3–6 months” for the 0.5–1 % upside and “by Aug 31” for the 200 bp downside. 7) **Ensure handle mapping**: use the canonical “dxy” handle and keep the sign/magnitude explicit. After these edits the view will meet the acceptance gate with a clear, evidence‑driven, and actionable DXY outlook.",
