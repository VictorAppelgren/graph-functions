  "title": "Premier League players will keep taking the knee despite Lionesses scrapping gesture",
  "description": "Exclusive: Number of rounds that top-flight players will take the knee before kick-off reduced to two after talks",
  "content": "Premier League players have agreed to continue taking the knee this season, just weeks after England Women scrapped the anti-racism gesture, claiming it had lost its impact. But top-flight stars will perform the controversial gesture on only two occasions during October\u2019s Black History Month in a further cut in the number of times it gets an airing. The decision to persist with taking the knee before specific matches linked to the Premier League\u2019s No Room for Racism campaign was made during a meeting of club captains on Thursday. It came two and a half weeks after the Lionesses announced they would stop performing the gesture following the racist abuse of defender Jess Carter at this summer\u2019s European Championship. That left the Premier League as one of the only competitions in which it remained ongoing five years after it was first introduced to English football during the coronavirus crisis. It was performed at every top-flight match for two seasons following the murder of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, by a police officer in the United States.\n\nThat left the Premier League as one of the only competitions in which it remained ongoing five years after it was first introduced to English football during the coronavirus crisis. It was performed at every top-flight match for two seasons following the murder of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, by a police officer in the United States. But it had a questionable impact on racism in football and became increasingly controversial due to its links to the Black Lives Matter movement and calls within it to defund the police. Three years ago, the Premier League announced players would only take the knee on the first and last match rounds of the season, the Boxing Day round of fixtures, two dedicated No Room For Racism match rounds, and at the FA Cup and EFL Cup finals. That was further scaled back to five match rounds the following season and four last term. Women\u2019s Super League players began taking the knee before every game at the start of the 2021-22 season. England\u2019s men\u2019s team stopped performing the gesture after the last World Cup in 2022 but their female counterparts continued to do so until the semi-finals and final of Euro 2025. They announced they would stop after Carter was inundated with racist abuse during the tournament, much of which Telegraph Sport has been told was posted to the team\u2019s social media channels. Players remained standing before their extra-time victory over Italy and the penalty-shootout triumph over Spain that saw them become the first senior England side to retain a major trophy. In a collective statement prior to the former fixture, the Lionesses said: \u201cRepresenting our country is the greatest honour. It is not right that while we are doing that, some of us are treated \u00addifferently \u00adsimply because of the colour of our skin. Until now, we have chosen to take the knee before matches. It is clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism. We have agreed as a squad to remain standing before kick\u2011off on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nThe statement added: \u201cThose behind this online poison must be held accountable.\u201d Explaining the team\u2019s decision, star defender Lucy Bronze said: \u201cWe feel as a collective, is the message as strong as it used to be? Is the message really hitting hard?. \u201cBecause, to us, it feels like it\u2019s not, if these things are still happening to our players in the biggest tournaments of their lives. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting another statement out there to say it\u2019s something that still is a problem, it\u2019s something that still needs to be put right. More needs to be done in football, more needs to be done in society. What that is right now as an individual, I don\u2019t exactly know. But it\u2019s something that us collectively as a team and as a federation want to work towards, we want to make changes. This is a small step trying to create another change. \u201cWe know the people higher up are the ones who can ultimately put in things to make change. But I think we know we\u2019re never helpless as players and our voices are loud enough to be heard by people around the world, whether that is social media platforms or federations like Uefa and Fifa. I think that\u2019s something we\u2019re very proud of as a Lionesses team, that we\u2019ve created this voice and a platform and we can reach the highest of heights. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to use that platform and that voice to make differences. The sentiment of taking a knee and then standing, as small as that might seem to some people, I think noise will be reached around the world.\u201d\n\nThe decision divided opinion among ex-players, politicians and anti-racism campaigners. ITV pundit Ian Wright said: \u201cI think the decision to take the knee should always have been a personal thing. \u201cIf you want to take the knee, take it. It was almost forced on people. If I was playing now and with everything the knee represents \u2013 if you go back to Colin Kaepernick and injustice and inequality and everything that goes with it \u2013 I would still take the knee. Even if I had to do it on my own.\u201d Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \u201cThank goodness the crazy gesture is over.\u201d Kick It Out said in a statement: \u201cWe support players in whatever actions they choose to take to signify their support in the fight against racism, but the focus should be on the reason behind those actions rather than the actions themselves. \u00a3Social media companies have failed to prevent exposure to this toxicity, and football must continue to use its collective power to hold them to account. We have been working with the government and the regulator, but we know that more urgency is needed from everyone involved.\u201d But Piara Powar, the executive director of European anti-discrimination body Fare, said: \u201cThe taking of the knee is a powerful anti-racist act and England Lionesses have shown leadership across Europe in taking it for so long. \u201cPowerful actions are needed right now to deal with issues that are being played out as we speak.\u201d",
