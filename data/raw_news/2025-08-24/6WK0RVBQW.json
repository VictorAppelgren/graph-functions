  "content": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Silicon Valley startup Lyten will need to convince carmakers it can succeed where bankrupt Swedish EV battery maker Northvolt failed - creating a European champion to reduce the region's reliance on China.\n\nLyten, which develops lithium-sulfur batteries, unexpectedly announced on August 7 it was buying Northvolt's assets, offering a lifeline to future European battery production for electric vehicles.\n\nBut customers and investors burned by the Northvolt experience remain wary of committing without seeing a proven product that can be delivered at scale, interviews with over a dozen battery industry experts, analysts and car company sources revealed.\n\nAs well as taking on Northvolt's production of lithium-ion batteries, Lyten plans to develop its own lithium-sulfur batteries for EVs, but will need substantial funds and lacks the Swedish company's erstwhile $50 billion order book.\n\nLithium-sulfur cells are one of several next-gen battery chemistries, promising a lighter, lower-cost alternative and lower dependence on critical minerals from China, but are still in their infancy.\n\nLyten currently produces lithium-sulfur cells at a pilot plant in Silicon Valley.\n\nJeep-owner Stellantis has - with a 2% stake - been in partnership with Lyten since 2023 to explore applications of Lyten's lithium-sulfur technology, including for battery cells, lightweight composites and on-board sensors.\n\nA Stellantis spokesperson said any supply deals would depend on technical validation, industrial scale-up, local production capacity and commercial terms.\n\nNorthvolt, despite attracting backers including Goldman Sachs, collapsed with $8 billion in debt in March after losing orders and key investor support, and missing production targets.\n\nCarmakers scaling down their electrification plans have also hit EV battery demand.\n\nNorthvolt's flagship factory in Skelleftea, Sweden, however, was starting to turn around in the weeks before closure, ramping up production to 30,000 lithium-ion cells a week.\n\nLyten CEO Dan Cook told Reuters that he hopes Northvolt's previous customers - which included Volkswagen brands - will return if the company proves itself by delivering consistently to a single, undetermined, customer at low volumes with good quality.\n\nFormer Northvolt-backer Scania said it was too early to discuss ordering cells from Lyten. Volvo Cars, which had partnered with Northvolt via its nascent battery unit Novo Energy before cutting ties, declined to comment on whether it would place orders.",
