  "content": "In a year marked by conflict, five nations continue to rank among the world's most peaceful. Residents reveal how policies and culture shape daily life and create a sense of calm.\n\nIn 2025, peace can feel like a rare commodity. Global wars are escalating, border security is tightening, and trade tensions continue to mount. According to the 2025 Global Peace Index (GPI), the number of state-based conflicts has reached its highest level since World War Two, with three more breaking out this year alone. Many countries are responding with increased militarisation.\n\nYet despite those grim statistics, some nations continue to prioritise peace. The GPI, produced by the Institute for Economics & Peace, tracks 23 indicators, from external conflicts and military expenditure to safety and security measures like terrorism and homicide. The countries ranked at the top of the index have been remarkably consistent for nearly two decades, showing the stability that peaceful policies can bring over the long haul.\n\nWe spoke to residents in some of the world's most peaceful counties to learn about how those policies shape day-to-day life \u2013 and what gives them a unique sense of security and calm.\n\nRanked number one since 2008, Iceland remains the world's most peaceful nation, leading across all three domains: safety and security, ongoing conflict and militarisation. It even recorded a 2% improvement this year, widening the gap from the second-place country on the list.",

      "text": "What would a US-China trade war do to the world economy?\nA full-scale trade war between China and the US is in prospect after President Donald Trump imposed 125% tariffs on Chinese goods imports.\nChina has retaliated by hiking its tariffs - or taxes - on goods imported from America to 125%.\nWhat does this escalating trade conflict mean for the world economy?\nHow much trade do they do?\nThe trade in goods between the two economic powers added up to around $585bn (\u00a3429bn) last year.\nThough the US imported far more from China ($440bn) than China imported from America ($145bn).\nThat left the US running a trade deficit with China - the difference between what it imports and exports - of $295bn in 2024. That's a considerable trade deficit, equivalent to around 1% of the US economy.\nBut it's less than the $1tn figure that Trump has repeatedly claimed this week.\nTrump already imposed significant tariffs on China in his first term as president. Those tariffs were kept in place and added to by his successor Joe Biden.\nTogether those trade barriers helped to bring the goods the US imported from China down from a 21% share of America's total imports in 2016 to 13% last year.\nSo the US reliance on China for trade has diminished over the past decade.\nYet analysts point out that some Chinese goods exports to the US have been re-routed through south-east Asian countries.\n- Live updates on this story\n- Is the US making $2bn a day from tariffs?\n- China is not backing down from Trump's tariff war. What next?\n- Who are the tariff 'PANICANS' derided as 'weak and stupid' by Trump?\nFor example, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on Chinese imported solar panels in 2018.\nBut the US Commerce Department presented evidence in 2023 that Chinese solar panel manufacturers had shifted their assembly operations to states such as Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam and then sent the finished products to the US from those countries, effectively evading the tariffs.\nThe new \"reciprocal\" tariffs Trump imposed on those countries - which he has now paused - could therefore push up the US price of a wide range of goods ultimately originating in China.\nWhat do the US and China import from each other?\nIn 2024, the biggest category of goods exports from the US to China were soybeans \u2013 primarily used to feed China's estimated 440 million pigs.\nThe US also sent pharmaceuticals and petroleum to China.\nGoing the other way, from China to the US, were large volumes of electronics, computers and toys. A large amount of batteries, which are vital for electric vehicles, were also exported.\nThe biggest category of US imports from China is smartphones, accounting for 9% of the total. A large proportion of these smartphones are made in China for Apple, a US-based multinational.\nThe US tariffs on China have been one of the main contributors to the decline in the market value of Apple in recent weeks, with its share price falling by 20% over the past month.\nAll these imported items to the US from China were already set to become considerably more expensive for Americans due to the 20% tariff the Trump administration had already imposed on Beijing.\nNow that the tariff has risen to 125% - and even 145% for some products - the impact could be six times greater.\nAnd US imports into China will also go up in price due to China's retaliatory tariffs, ultimately hurting Chinese consumers in a similar way.\nBut beyond tariffs, there are other ways for these two nations to attempt to damage each other through trade.\nChina has a central role in refining many vital metals for industry, from copper and lithium to rare earths.\nBeijing could place obstacles in the way of these metals reaching the US.\nThis is something it has already done in the case of two materials called germanium and gallium, which are used by the military in thermal imaging and radar.\nAs for the US, it could attempt to tighten the technological blockade on China started by Joe Biden by making it harder for China to import the kind of advanced microchips \u2013 which are vital for applications like artificial intelligence \u2013 it still can't yet produce itself.\nDonald Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro, has suggested this week that the US could apply pressure on other countries, including Cambodia, Mexico and Vietnam, not to trade with China if they want to continue to exporting to the US.\nHow might this affect other countries?\nThe US and China together account for such a large share of the global economy, around 43% this year according to the International Monetary Fund.\nIf they were to engage in an all-out trade war that slowed their growth down, or even pushed them into recession, that would likely harm other countries' economies in the form of slower global growth.\nGlobal investment would also likely suffer.\nThere are other potential consequences.\nChina is the world's biggest manufacturing nation and is producing far more than its population consumes domestically.\nIt is already running an almost $1tn goods surplus \u2013 meaning it is exporting more goods to the rest of the world than it imports.\nAnd it is often producing those goods at below the true cost of production due to domestic subsidies and state financial support, like cheap loans, for favoured firms.\nSteel is an example of this.\nThere is a risk that if such products were unable to enter the US, Chinese firms could seek to \"dump\" them abroad.\nWhile that could be beneficial for some consumers, it could also undercut producers in countries threatening jobs and wages.\nThe lobby group UK Steel has warned of the danger of excess steel potentially being redirected to the UK market.\nThe spillover impacts of an all-out China-US trade war would be felt globally, and most economists judge that the impact would be highly negative."

      "text": "'A hostile state': Why some travellers are avoiding the US\nAs the list of nations issuing travel warnings to the US grows, some visitors are opting to boycott it entirely. Here's why many foreigners are changing their travel plans and what this could mean for Americans.\nAs President Donald Trump implements sweeping new policies, issues tariffs on longtime allies and leads an immigration crackdown, some international travellers are rethinking their travel plans to the US.\nThe nation's stricter border enforcement has recently led to the detention of Canadian and European tourists, prompting Germany, the UK, Denmark, Finland and Portugal to issue travel warnings and advisories for the country. Now, it appears that a growing number of voices are advocating for an all-out boycott of travel to the US.\nThe cold shoulder has been particularly noticeable from the US's northern neighbour, Canada, which sends more than 20 million visitors to the country per year \u2013 more than any other nation. In response to Trump's proposed tariffs and repeated threats to annex the nation, former prime minister Justin Trudeau recently urged his fellow Canadians: \"Now is the time to choose Canada,\" adding, \"it might mean changing your summer vacation plans to stay here in Canada.\"\nThe appeal seems to have caught on, as many infuriated Canadians are now boycotting US holidays. In February, border crossings were down by more than 20%, according to Statistics Canada. The US Travel Association estimates that even a 10% reduction in Canadian visitors could result in $2.1bn in lost spending and 14,000 job losses.\nWhile some Canadians are snubbing the US because of policy changes, others say they simply don't feel as safe as they once did.\n\"My partner and I decided not to go ahead with our planned vacations to the US this year,\" said Canadian travel journalist Kate Dingwall. \"I worry about the border and getting stuck somehow, especially with how prickly Trump is to Canada. There's just a sense of uneasiness around visiting America at the moment.\"\nKeith Serry, a writer and comedian based in Montreal, Quebec, cancelled five April appearances in New York City (including four shows at the upcoming New York City Fringe festival) due to the tense political situation.\n\"This decision will, of course, rob me of the opportunity to share my art with many of you in New York I've grown to know and love,\" he wrote on his Facebook page. \"That said, the honest truth is that I just don't feel safe travelling to the States right now. In addition, I feel a powerful disinclination to spending my money in any way that might aid the economy of a hostile state.\"\nIn recent months, some Canadians have faced tougher border security than ever before \u2013 even those with clean records and valid documents. One woman made international headlines as she was detained by ICE for two weeks in reportedly bleak conditions after her visa was revoked.\n\"We're a country that prides itself, imperfectly but intentionally, on values like inclusion, equity and human rights. When those values feel out of step with what's happening across the border, it becomes harder to justify participation,\" said Amar Charles Marouf, a Canadian citizen who works as growth strategist at the international law firm Gowling WLG. \"The political climate raises broader questions. What kind of treatment are we normalising? What assumptions are being made about who is welcome and who isn\u2019t?\"\nIt's not that Canadians aren't traveling internationally; many are simply swapping their traditional destinations. Marouf says Mexico, South America and Europe all feel more welcoming at the moment. \"California will be there when this is all over, but I just feel like there's less risk going to Portugal instead,\" added Dingwall.\nSome international properties have seen a bump in traffic, directly attributable to Canadians now spurning the US. \"In the last several weeks, we've received 10-plus leads from Canadians seeking to relocate events from the United States this summer,\" said Diarmaid O'Sullivan, director of sales & marketing at Hamilton Princess Hotel & Beach Club Bermuda. \"This is a mix of leisure travellers, including those planning weddings, and companies relocating business events. This represents an approximately 20% increase in forecasted revenue from the Canadian market.\"\nInterestingly, all of this is happening just as the US had been experiencing record growth in the travel and tourism sector. Marta Soligo, professor at UNLV and director of Tourism Research at the UNLV Office of economic development, points to The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC)'s 2024 Economic Impact Trends Report, which showed the US as the world's top travel and tourism market. Not only did the industry achieve an unprecedented economic impact of $2.36tn in the US, but the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projections indicate that the US economy will add more than 800,000 jobs in the leisure and hospitality sector.\n\"Such numbers help us understand the importance of the sector in the US, showing that a decrease in tourism from top-origin countries could significantly damage the US economy,\" said Soligo. \"The consequences of these issues can impact both large US-based corporations, such as hotel chains, and small businesses alike.\"\nThe change in travel patterns is already having a tangible effect on the US economy. Tourism Economics recently updated its inbound US travel forecast from a predicted 8.8% growth, to a 5.1% decline, attributing the change to \"strained\" travel sentiment, \"sweeping tariffs\" and \"exchange rate shifts\" making travel to the US more expensive.\n\"The combination of travel bans and a reduction of US travel could have a material impact on tourism and economic development,\" said Jeff Le, former deputy cabinet secretary for the State of California and the state's federal coordinator during the first Trump Administration.\nIn California alone, international visitors provided more than $24bn in local economies in 2023, reports Le. \"Losing this would likely hurt both people and local government funds,\" he said. \"It is harder to measure reputational loss, but I cannot imagine active boycotts help.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How Trump's sweeping new policies could change travel\n\u2022 The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n\u2022 The US island that once belonged to Russia\nWhile the broad impact of boycotting travel to the US could have substantial national and governmental effects, some advocacy organisations also warn that the loss of tourism dollars is most likely to be felt by individuals.\n\"It's US workers and small businesses who get affected by US travel boycotts,\" said Thomas F Goodwin, leader of the Exhibitions and Conferences Alliance. Goodwin notes that more than 99% of the US business and professional events industry is made up of small businesses, and more than 80% of all exhibitors are US and international small businesses. \"When international business travellers forgo coming to the US, everyone from exposition booth builders and general service contractors to venue caterers and individual skilled labourers suffer \u2013 not politicians or the government. Boycotts have a knock-on effect on hotels, taxis, restaurants, local entertainers, high street commerce and more.\"\nThere is also a cost that is harder to quantify: the global influence of American culture.\n\"Visitor numbers declining in the US sends a signal that the US is losing its soft power \u2013 the influence it once held through openness, cultural leadership and global goodwill,\" said Neri Karra Sillaman, entrepreneurship expert at the University of Oxford and author of the forthcoming book Pioneers: 8 Principles of Business Longevity from Immigrant Entrepreneurs. \"If this trend continues, it may force tourism boards or even local governments to create counter narratives to win back trust. I am not sure if it will be effective, however, since at the end of the day, it is the policies of the government that give the ultimate direction and influence perception.\"\nSillaman notes that travel boycotts also have a long-term cost to culture, the economy and overall innovation. \"When academics, scientists, artists, designers and entrepreneurs start to choose other countries instead of US, the US is going to lose more than just visitors,\" she said. \"In the long term, it's going to lose its competitiveness, goodwill and it will turn into a closed society that stifles growth and innovation.\"\nThis human impact of boycotts also shows up in a myriad of ways, noted Missouri lawyer John Beck. \"I've worked with hundreds of non-citizens over the last 15 years and seen firsthand how policies between governments can result in individuals \u2013 regular travellers, students, families \u2013 getting caught in the middle,\" he said. \"It's rarely about the politics. It's about missed weddings, lost business deals or being unable to visit a dying parent.\"\nBeck says he has worked with at least 80 clients who have either delayed or cancelled US travel due to real or perceived hostility over the past few years. This causes complications with split families, international companies who can't move talent quickly and lost business due to the lack of ease of movement. Even though the geopolitical stakes are high, there is a human aspect on both sides of the border.\n\"Most Americans have little to do with the policies that frustrate global travellers,\" he said. \"They just want safety, fairness and dignity. That's what we need to protect.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week."
