  "title": "Five Years Ago, 'The Batman' Made Its Brutal, Moody Debut",
  "description": "'The Batman' saga continues to slowly unfold, but its debut trailer still paints a confident picture of Matt Reeves' vision.",
  "content": "On August 22, 2020, Warner Bros. held its first-ever DC FanDome, a weekend-long virtual event meant to make up for that year\u2019s San Diego Comic-Con, which was canceled due to the pandemic. If you\u2019ve ever followed big industry events like the Game Awards or\u2026 well, Comic-Con, you know they often come with a big trailer or two that\u2019s meant to make it all worth it. And for WB, the big showcase for its inaugural, short-lived event was the very first look at Matt Reeves\u2019 The Batman.\n\nTrailers for superhero movies have gradually become more and more of a big deal, whether they\u2019re telegraphed in advance, leaked, or appear just out of the blue. The Batman already caught the internet\u2019s eye with casting Twilight alum Robert Pattinson in the lead role, and excitement truly began to grow once Reeves showed the actor in his Batsuit and the most car-looking Batmobile in years.\n\nIt also didn\u2019t hurt that this was the first solo Bat-movie in nearly a decade and technically the true start of WB\u2019s plans to dabble around with a cinematic multiverse that kept this Batman in his own world away from other goings-on at the time.\n\nWithin 24 hours, that teaser amassed over 31 million views, and while those numbers are short in the grand scheme, it did its job in getting people talking about Batman again. If online circles weren\u2019t discussing its darkness in comparison to the Nolan films, they were gushing over Colin Farrell\u2019s makeup job as Penguin or listening to Nirvana\u2019s \u201cSomething in the Way\u201d on repeat. For a movie that was openly marketing itself back then as still in the works, it won enough of the internet over right away that they were willing to follow Reeves to hell if it meant getting to see this on the big screen.\n\nHad things gone to plan, The Batman would\u2019ve come out in June 2021, but the pandemic forced a readjustment. The Batman was a quarter into production when it was indefinitely paused for most of 2020, during which the film\u2019s dialect coach Andrew Jack passed away from covid and Pattinson himself tested positive just days after work resumed again. As a result, things were basically radio silent until late 2021, when the film basically reintroduced itself with a new trailer that kept the mood and song but featured more bombast and a great idea of what the movie would be about. On just one of WB\u2019s YouTube accounts, it\u2019s gotten over 65 million views and closes on a shot that\u2019ll likely define Reeves\u2019 entire Batman tenure. If there were any doubts that people lost interest in this movie because of the pandemic, that second trailer sure proved that wrong.\n\nSince that first trailer came and went, The Batman (which hit theaters March 4, 2022) has continued to have a hold on the internet, which has been waiting impatiently for its sequel. Like its predecessor, The Batman Part II has had no shortage of production problems and delays, to the degree that DC Studios head James Gunn politely (but firmly) told people to back off Reeves. The second movie isn\u2019t due for another two years and change and only recently entered pre-production\u2014but when the first proper look at that one hits, expect comparisons between it and its predecessor\u2019s first trailer as fans once again prepare to fall in love with Reeves\u2019 interpretation of DC\u2019s ever-brooding leading man.",

      "text": "Trying to keep track of what\u2019s coming in the realm of Star Trek feels like trying to stop a tribble from procreating. Before even more new series are announced, here\u2019s our guide of when to expect all the new Star Trek shows, as well as returning familiar favorites, and what else is in the works right now. Engage!\nThis post was last updated 7/14/23.\nCurrently Airing: Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 2\nThe Enterprise is back after a successful first season, and this time Captain Kirk will be along for the ride with another appearance by Paul Wesley after his surprise finale role in season one. Not much else is known about the season so far, other than one episode will see the show crossover with Star Trek: Lower Decks in a live-action/animated hybrid directed by The Next Generation\u2019s Jonathan Frakes. The show has also been renewed for a third season.\nSeason two recaps:\n\u201cTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\u201d\n\u201cCharades\u201d\nUpcoming: Star Trek: Lower Decks Season 4\nThe third season of the animated series following the misfit crew of the USS Cerritos\u2014and in particular its cadre of ensigns, Mariner (Tawny Newsome), Boimler (Jack Quaid), Tendi (No\u00ebl Wells), and Rutherford (Eugene Cordero)\u2014once again followed our heroic ensigns and the remaining bridge officers aboard the Cerritos. Season four will be arriving in late summer. The show has also been renewed for a fifth season.\nUpcoming: Star Trek: Discovery Season 5\nExpected in early 2024, Discovery\u2019s fifth season will be 10 episodes long, down from the 13 of prior seasons. In the wake of season four\u2018s climax earlier this year, Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) led her crew in a desperate attempt to save the galaxy from a mysterious anomaly created by an extra-galactic race, ensuring peace and stability for the Federation once more\u2026 for now. As her romantic partner Book (David Ajala) pays time for his own role in a campaign to surreptitiously destroy that anomaly, we\u2019re not sure what awaits Burnham and Discovery\u2019s crew just yet, but given this show, we\u2019re sure it\u2019ll be very, very dramatic.\nIn Flux: Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2\nThe animated series aimed at younger Trek fans (and Janeway fans!) and kids at heart can be found on both Nickelodeon and Paramount+. The first season was divided into two parts, with part two wrapping up at the end of 2022; after Paramount+ announced it would not move forward with the show\u2019s already greenlit season two, it was removed from the service. (A home release of the complete first season is still possible; the first 10 episodes are still available for purchase.) Fans are still waiting to hear if Prodigy season two will surface on a different outlet.\nUpcoming: Starfleet Academy\nIt\u2019s really happening! After a long tease, filming on this series will begin in 2024. Here\u2019s the official announcement from co-showrunners and executive producers Alex Kurtzman and Noga Landau:\n\u201cAdmission is now open to Starfleet Academy! Explore the galaxy! Captain your destiny! For the first time in over a century, our campus will be re-opened to admit individuals a minimum of 16 Earth years (or species equivalent) who dream of exceeding their physical, mental and spiritual limits, who value friendship, camaraderie, honor and devotion to a cause greater than themselves. The coursework will be rigorous, the instructors among the brightest lights in their respective fields, and those accepted will live and study side-by-side with the most diverse population of students ever admitted. Today we encourage all who share our dreams, goals and values to join a new generation of visionary cadets as they take their first steps toward creating a bright future for us all. Apply today! Ex Astris, Scientia!\u201d\nUpcoming (movie): Star Trek: Section 31\nAnnounced as a TV series back in 2019 as a spinoff for fan-favorite Discovery guest star Michelle Yeoh, this plunge into the seediest side of Starfleet\u2014the shadowy spy organization Section 31 first introduced in Deep Space Nine\u2014is now planned as a Paramount+ film.\nNewly minted Oscar winner Yeoh will return as former emperor of the Mirror Universe\u2019s Terran Empire, Phillipa Georgiou, now turned into a kinder, but still kickass person by her time with Michael Burnham. \u201cI\u2019m beyond thrilled to return to my Star Trek family and to the role I\u2019ve loved for so long,\u201d Yeoh said in a statement. \u201cSection 31 has been near and dear to my heart since I began the journey of playing Philippa all the way back when this new golden age of Star Trek launched. To see her finally get her moment is a dream come true in a year that\u2019s shown me the incredible power of never giving up on your dreams. We can\u2019t wait to share what\u2019s in store for you, and until then: live long and prosper (unless Emperor Georgiou decrees otherwise)!\u201d\nWritten by Craig Sweeny and directed by Olatunde Osunsanmi, Star Trek: Section 31 will start production later this year, and eventually come to Paramount+.\nWhere Can I Stream Classic Star Trek Shows?\nThat\u2019s all the new bits of Star Trek coming. But what about the old Star Trek? In the U.S. at least, the vast majority of classic Star Trek shows are available exclusively to stream on Paramount+ (albeit not without issues), although some holdouts remain on other streaming services. Here\u2019s a full list of classic Star Trek shows and where to stream them, as well as links to our recommended episode guides for every series!\nStar Trek: The Original Series (Paramount+)\nStar Trek: The Animated Series (Paramount+)\nStar Trek: The Next Generation (Paramount+, Netflix)\nStar Trek: Deep Space Nine (Paramount+, Netflix)\nStar Trek: Voyager (Paramount+)\nStar Trek: Enterprise (Paramount+)\nWant more io9 news?

Enter teenage prodigy Riri Williams (played by Dominique Thorne), who creates a brand new, ultra-advanced armored suit. Other cast members include Anthony Ramos (In the Heights) as the villain the Hood and Lyric Ross (This Is Us). Chinaka Hodge (TNT\u2019s Snowpiercer) is attached as the head writer, and Black Panther director Ryan Coogler is an executive producer alongside Marvel\u2019s Kevin Feige and others. Manny Montana (Good Girls) has joined the cast of Marvel\u2019s Ironheart in an undisclosed role as well as Han Solo himself, Alden Ehrenreich.\nAgatha: Coven of Chaos\nRelease date: Winter 2024 (On Disney+)\nThis spinoff from WandaVision will star Kathryn Hahn as her fan-favorite character Agatha Harkness. Joe Locke (Heartstopper) and Aubrey Plaza (Hahn\u2019s Parks and Recreation co-star, among her other many credits) are also in the cast, as is Patti LuPone. (A second WandaVision spin-off, this one focusing on Paul Bettany\u2019s Vision, is also reportedly in the works.)\nCaptain America: Brave New World\nRelease date: August 26, 2024 (in Theaters)\nWe\u2019ve got a new Captain America, so it was inevitable that we\u2019d be getting a new Cap movie. Anthony Mackie will appear in the title role. Harrison Ford was announced to take over the role of General Thaddeus Ross and will make his debut in this release.\nDaredevil: Born Again\nRelease date: Spring 2024 (On Disney+)\nCharlie Cox and Vincent D\u2019Onofrio will return as Daredevil and Kingpin for an 18-episode Disney+ series.

Steven Yeun (Nope) signed on for an undisclosed role\nBlade\nRelease date: February 14, 2025 (In theaters)\nDisney hasn\u2019t revealed much about this reboot of the franchise that features a badass vampire-hunter who is also a vampire, but we know that it stars two-time Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali, who also played Cornell \u201cCottonmouth\u201d Stokes in Netflix Marvel series Luke Cage. We also know Blade appeared (or at least his voice did) in the end credits of The Eternals. After losing director Bassam Tariq, who would have been the first U.S.-Pakistani person to helm a Marvel Studios film, Blade was put on pause, and its release date was shifted. But now it has a new director in place: Lovecraft Country\u2019s Yann Demange, as well as a writer in Michael Starrbury, so the September 2024 date looks ever more likely.\nDeadpool 3\nRelease date: May 3, 2024 (In Theaters)\nRyan Reynolds\u2019 \u201cmerc with the mouth\u201d is set to appear in Disney\u2019s first R-rated film following the company\u2019s completed acquisition of Fox assets. Oh, and did you happen to hear that Hugh Jackman\u2019s Wolverine is also appearing in this one? Unless you are cut off from all social media, you no doubt caught that announcement.\nDeadpool 3 writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wenick spoke with Den of Geek about how Deadpool\u2019s move to the MCU will not affect the feel of the movie. Or, in Wernick\u2019s words: \u201cDeadpool\u2019s gonna be Deadpool.\u201d Reese also said that Disney has been more than willing to ensuring the franchise keeps its core identity. Shawn Levy (Free Guy) is directing.\nFantastic Four\nRelease date: May 2, 2025 (In theaters)\nPhase Six of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, kicks off with the MCU debut of Marvel\u2019s most famous family. Jon Watts was scheduled to directbut he is no longer doing that\u2014Matt Shakaman of WandaVision is now in the chair\u2014and though we saw John Krasinski as Mr. Fantastic in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, there\u2019s no guarantee he returns.\nAvengers: The Kang Dynasty\nRelease date: May 1, 2026 (In theaters)\nSince neither Phase Four or Phase Five ended with Avengers movies, Phase Six will end with two, back to back. The first is The Kang Dynasty, a title which heavily suggests that Kang (Jonathan Majors) will play a major role. Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi) will direct.\nAvengers: Secret Wars\nRelease date: May 7, 2027 (In theaters)\nIt all comes down to this. Phase Six, and the whole Phase 4-6 arc of the Multiverse Saga, ends with Secret Wars. We don\u2019t know anything about the plot other than the comics that the title is based on; Marvel veteran Michael Waldron (Loki, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness) is writing the script.\nArmor Wars\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nThis project\u2014originally slated for a Disney+ series, but now getting the feature film treatment\u2014will follow James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) as he tracks down stolen tech that allows criminals to replicate Iron Man technology.\nAlso: Marvel slotted several other projects for Phase Six that take place alongside Fantastic Four and the Avengers films. There are two in fall 2024, two in winter 2024, one in winter 2025, two in spring 2025 and two in summer 2025. Some of those are probably\u2026\nUnscheduled But Probably Still Happening Shows & Movies\nMoon Knight Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nMoon Knight himself, Oscar Isaac, was recently spotted in Egypt and teased that a second season of his show could be on the way.

And DC Fandome gave us our first legitimate look at the upcoming superhero film in the form of a two-minute teaser trailer.\nEverything we\u2019ve seen from The Batman so far has been incredibly dark and the trailer is more of the same. Darker even. Apparently the Riddler has Batman (referred to as \u201cyear two Batman\u201d earlier at Fandome) in his sights and this Batman does not mess around. Wait until you see just how intense things are about to get.\nAnd that\u2019s only from 25% of the movie. The rest has yet to be shot.\nAmong the highlights are the brief glimpses we get of Kravitz as Catwoman, Jeffrey Wright\u2019s stoic, powerful Commission Gordon, a creepy AF Riddler (the guy with the tape), and a Batman who is apparently as violent as we\u2019ve seen the character in a while. He straight fucked that goon up. There\u2019s no other way to say it.\nThe trailer is simply jampacked with teases and it\u2019s going to give fans lots to digest and discuss in the coming days, weeks, months\u2026years.\nThe Batman is currently expected to hit theaters October 1, 2021. We also know Reeves\u2019 Bat-verse will be expanded on HBO Max in a Gotham police-focused series. Reeves revealed that that show will take place during \u201cyear one\u201d of the Batman journey. So, a prequel to the movie, at least to start. The myth of this masked vigilante is rising and we\u2019ll see it through the eyes of a corrupt police department. There\u2019s no word on when it\u2019ll be released\nhttps://gizmodo.com/here-he-is-the-batman-1844789294\nFor more, make sure you\u2019re following us on our Instagram @io9dotcom."

      "text": "Last night Geoff Keighley and all the firepower of a fully armed and operational marketing platform descended on Los Angeles for the 10th Game Awards, continuing in fine form as an amalgam video game trailer fest and occasional award show. In service to the former, there was plenty to see over the night as one world premiere after another introduced a bevy of upcoming games\u2013if you missed it, here\u2019s our run down of our favourites from the worlds of sci-fi, fantasy, and horror.\nDispatch\nAaron Paul stars as a down-on-his-luck former superhero now working at an agency tasked with assigning superheroic freelancers to crimes as they happen, in this intriguing new game from former Telltale Games developers.\nThe Witcher 4\nCD Projket Red returns to the Continent for an all new saga\u2013and this time Ciri\u2019s all grown up to become the titular protagonist of what is promising to be a new trilogy of RPG adventures.\nNinja Gaiden: Ragebound\nRevealed during the pre-show, the next game from the developers of Blasphemous is a retro-2D take on Ninja Gaiden.\nOnimusha: Way of the Sword\nCapcom\u2019s beloved horror and Japanese-folklore-infused hack-and-slashes are finally making a comeback.\nThe Outer Worlds 2\nThe latest trailer for Obsidian\u2019s sci-fi RPG sequel is mostly a gag about how well they are known for making RPG sequels, but it does give us a little bit of a better look at the expanded scope of the new game along the way.\nSlay the Spire 2\nThe roguelike deckbuilder returns for more card-based strategy in our latest look at the followup.\nSolasta 2\nThe follow up to the massive RPG recruits Baldur\u2019s Gate 3\u2018s narrator Amelia Tyler as a mysterious new villain.\nElden Ring: Nightreign\nGet ready to return to the Lands Between for a new standalone co-operative game set in the same world as FromSoftware\u2019s latest addition to the Souls-ian canon. Just don\u2019t call it Elden Ring 2!\nShadow Labyrinth\nIn a twist that is both surprising and also extremely not surprising, it turns out that wild Pac-Man episode of Secret Level was actually just an advert for an actual upcoming game, in this weird, dark metroidvania twist on the classic gaming icon.\nOkami 2\nAmaterasu and Hideki Kamiya are back at Capcom for an all-new continuation of the beloved 2006 action-adventure game. Sure, this trailer tells us very little, but it does remind us that Okami\u2018s music was phenomenal.\nSteel Hunters\nWorld of Tanks developer Wargaming is trading tanks for, well, walking tanks, in an original mecha shooter.\nFumito Ueda\u2019s Next Project\nGen Design revealed an untitled look at the next game from the creator of Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, and it was as haunting as it was mysterious. Giant robots? A mystical wave of annihilation? Even more deliberate climbing mechanics? We don\u2019t know what it is next exactly, but we\u2019re on board.\nTurok: Origins\nThe dino-shooting series returns with a new reboot from Saber, bringing third-person action (and maybe even some co-op team ups) with it.\nSplit Fiction\nThe next ambitious game from It Takes Two\u2018s developer Josef Fares follows two female writers, who find themselves trapped in simulations of their fantasy and sci-fi works and forced to work together to survive.\nBorderlands 4\nIt\u2019s more Borderlands! Four new characters to play, plenty of multicolored loot to pick up, and a dire new threat for you to put all that loot into action against.\nGame of Thrones: Kingsroad\nTired of all these swanky licensed games like Star Wars Outlaws or Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, uh, looking good? Netmarble\u2019s take on the HBO fantasy certainly has approximations of famous faces from across Game of Thrones that you\u2019ll rub furry-cloaked shoulders with as you play a hulking new member of the Night\u2019s Watch.\nIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophet\nNaughty Dog launches an escape vector from endlessly re-releasing The Last of Us and its sequel for an all new \u201980s-tinged sci-fi world. It stars Tati Gabrielle as Jordan, a bounty hunter stranded on an alien world that no one\u2019s managed to leave in centuries, as she carves her way through menacing foes with a cool-as-hell-looking equalizer laser sword.\nWant more io9 news?

So much so that he recently expressed his frustration with the demand in defense of the time DC Studios was taking.\n\u201cListen, we\u2019re supposed to get a script in June. I hope that happens. We feel really good about it,\u201d Gunn told Entertainment Weekly, and colorfully added, \u201cPeople should get off Matt\u2019s nuts because it\u2019s like, let the guy write the screenplay in the amount of time he needs to write it. That\u2019s just the way it is. He doesn\u2019t owe you something because you like his movie. I mean, you like his movie because of Matt. So let Matt do things the way he does.\u201d And that should go to Robert Pattinson too, the star who has joked he\u2019s going to be old Batman by the time the sequel film gets shooting.\nIt seems folks forget the fact that arc of The Penguin was originally a huge part of the sequel plans which were then pulled and developed into the incredible Colin Farrell starrer series. Getting a whole show in between to dig into that villain origin story was great even if it took place while Bats was maybe spending time with Selina Kyle over in Bl\u00fcdhaven.\n\u201cI am irritated by people,\u201d Gunn added. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just that thing people don\u2019t need to be entitled about. It\u2019s going to come out when he feels good about the screenplay. And Matt\u2019s not going to give me the screenplay until he feels good about the screenplay.\u201d\nGunn also added the constant bugging has nearly pushed him off the internet.\n\u201cI\u2019ve kind of quit because it just happens so often,\u201d he noted. \u201cThere are a couple of people, specifically, who have pretty large followings who just consistently put out false stories, just one after the other after the other, 95% of the time. Maybe once out of every 20 times, they say something that has some slight or partial basis in reality. And it gets to be old. I\u2019m not sure, some of those people, that I\u2019m not actually helping them in a certain way by debunking them, because you\u2019re giving them traffic, which I always do, but I think they like it.

      "text": "With great power comes great responsibility. Yes, we know that\u2019s a different superhero, but how is the director of The Batman feeling?\n\u201cTerrified,\u201d says Matt Reeves.\nThe journey to the screen of the new Batman movie has been a long and gruelling one. Almost a decade ago, Ben Affleck was cast as the Caped Crusader in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. It is Affleck\u2019s most successful film at the box-office. By every other metric it was a disaster: critics hated it, fans hated it more and it launched DC down a route of superhero ensemble movies (Suicide Squad; Justice League) that got worse and worse. For every new star in an ever-more-twinkling Marvel Cinematic Universe, rival DC couldn\u2019t catch a break. The memory of Christopher Nolan\u2019s benchmark The Dark Knight trilogy appeared to be going gently into that good night. The best bet for Bat fans looked like another outing for Lego Batman, which at least was funny. But DC wanted another Batman movie.\nWhat to Read Next\nThey put in a call to Matt Reeves, director of the acclaimed monster movie Cloverfield (2008), as well as Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) and War for the Planet of the Apes (2017). \u201cBen [Affleck] had been working on a version of the script,\u201d Reeves says, \u201cand I said, \u2018Here\u2019s the thing: I respect that the DC Universe has become an extended universe and all the movies were kind of connected. But another Batman film, it shouldn\u2019t have to carry the weight of connecting the characters from all those other movies. I didn\u2019t want them in there.\u201d\nA Batman movie without Aquaman (he can control sea life), Cyborg (he\u2019s a cyborg) or any of the rest of the corny Justice League characters already sounded like a 100 per cent improvement. As Robert Pattinson \u2014 we\u2019ll get to him \u2014 says in a two-minute promotional showreel for the new film, \u201cBatman has stood out as one of the major characters of the 20th century, and so many people connect with it on such a deep level for so many reasons.\u201d He deserved better.\nReeves\u2019s next issue was this. Sure, you could reboot Batman \u2014 it\u2019s been done dozens of times since he first appeared in Detective Comics in 1939, almost certainly more. But would anyone have the stomach for yet another retelling of his origin story, from a slightly different angle? \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it so many times,\u201d Reeves says. \u201cIt\u2019s been done too much. I knew we couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\nHe set about a ton of reading and was blown away by the comic Batman: Year One, the 1987 four-issue run by writer Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli, that showed a young and in-turmoil Bruce Wayne figuring out how to be a be a vigilante. The tone is detective noir, the violence is street-level and nasty, and you will search in vain for a feat of superhero derring-do or a groaning Mr Freeze \u201cAllow-me-to-break-the-ice\u201d-style pun. Calling Batman: Year One realistic would be a stretch. But it is somewhere near as realistic as a comic book about a mentally dubious loner who puts on a disguise and begins hunting criminals come night. This proto-Batman underestimates his opponents, gets shot by the police, and his costume doesn\u2019t fit. (It\u2019s great, and it happens to be my favourite comic book.) Other influences on Reeves included New Hollywood classics from the 1970s: The French Connection, Chinatown and Taxi Driver. Also, Kurt Cobain.\n\u201cEarly on, when I was writing, I started listening to Nirvana, and there was something about [Nevermind song] \u2018Something in the Way\u2019, which is in the first trailer, which is part of the voice of that character. When I considered, \u2018How do you do Bruce Wayne in a way that hasn\u2019t been seen before?\u2019 I started thinking, \u2018What if some tragedy happened [ie: Wayne sees his parents murdered] and this guy becomes so reclusive, we don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing? Is this guy some kind of wayward, reckless, drug addict?\u2019 And the truth is that he is a kind of drug addict. His drug is his addiction to this drive for revenge. He\u2019s like a Batman Kurt Cobain.\u201d\nBatman\u2019s main opponent in The Batman is The Riddler. Not the Jim Carrey version in the lime-green catsuit covered in question marks from Val Kilmer\u2019s Batman Forever (1995). But a costume-less, schlubby Paul Dano interpretation, who communicates with the police via cyphers, based on the Zodiac Killer. Batman is one superhero without superpowers \u2014 but he is \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest detective\u201d. Reeves\u2019s Batman, to the shock and awe of The Internet when it was announced in 2019, is Robert Pattinson.\n\u201cOf course, the idea [to fit with the Year One story] was to make him a younger actor,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd in the process of writing the movie, I watched [the fantastic 2017 Safdie brothers film] Good Time, and I thought, \u2018Okay, he\u2019s got an inner kind of rage that connects with this character and a dangerousness, and I can feel this desperation.\u2019 And I became dead-set on it being Rob. And I had no idea if Rob had any interest! Because, of course, he had done all of these indie movies after he established himself in Twilight.\u201d\nUnbeknownst to Reeves \u2014 or presumably anyone at DC \u2014 he had one thing on his side: Pattinson was a huge Batman fan. \u201cHe\u2019d heard that we were doing this and got excited about the idea that there was going to be another version of this character,\u201d Reeves says. \u201cAnd so when I met him, and he read the script, we talked for a long, long time and I realised, \u2018This guy is a massive fan\u2019.\u201d\nPattinson fit the part \u2014 but he still had to audition. Ridiculously, he did so in Val Kilmer\u2019s old Batsuit. \u201cWarner Brothers are like, \u2018Look, we\u2019re not going to make anything for somebody for a screentest\u2019. But you go there [into WB] and they\u2019ve got all the suits, going back to Michael Keaton. They said, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve done this on every single one. [Christian] Bale came in and he put on one of the original suits.\u2019\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say it fitted well,\u201d Reeves continues. \u201cBut it fitted the best. It was sort of old, and as he started acting, he started heating up the cowl and the cowl started to sag on his face. You could see him thinking, \u2018How am I going to act in this suit?\u2019 But putting on a Batman suit is also transformative. You start to feel the power of having that armour on.\u201d\nCompleting the Grunge Gotham vibe, as the 31m people who saw The Batman trailer in its first 24 hours noticed, Pattinson\u2019s Batman is wearing emo-eyeliner. What\u2019s up with that?\n\u201cYou can\u2019t wear a cowl and not wear that. All of the Batmen wear that,\u201d says Reeves, not entirely convincingly. \u201cI just loved the idea of taking off [the mask] and under that there\u2019s the sweating and the dripping and the whole theatricality of becoming this character.\u201d\nOne of the things that makes the Batman character so interesting is that he\u2019s so malleable. He can be campy Adam West from the 1960s or angry Christian Bale from the 2000s \u2014 and both are equally valid. By an overwhelming majority, the YouTube comments section is going crazy for the \u201cI\u2019m vengeance!\u201d this-guy\u2019s-nuts punchiness of Pattinson\u2019s 2020s version, based on two or three trailers. But it\u2019s fair to say that not everyone thought the skinny guy from Twilight was a stroke of genius casting.\n\u201cThere has been no actor, when his announcement that he was going to be playing Batman in one of the feature films was announced, that has not received a backlash,\u201d Reeves says.\n\u201cThe people who were excited, I knew it was because they knew Rob\u2019s work post-Twilight. The people who weren\u2019t excited, I knew it was because they didn\u2019t know Rob\u2019s work post-Twilight.\u201d\nWhat about the other iconography that comes with the character, however you choose tell his story? In The Batman, Wayne Manor is depicted as falling to bits \u2014 \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about any of the trappings of being a [millionaire] Wayne at this point,\u201d Reeves says, citing Gus Van Sant\u2019s Last Days, the 2005 fictionalised version of Kurt Cobain\u2019s sad, slow demise (just like that film, we\u2019ll apparently see amps stacked up in a storage room).\nThe new Batcave is based on a secret underground railway that still exists in New York. \u201cThe idea being that some of these wealthy industrialist families had private train cars at the turn of the century. So the Batcave is actually in the foundation of this tower. It was [another] way of saying, \u2018How can we root all these things in things that feel real, but also extraordinary?\u2019\u201d\nAnd finally, a new Batmobile. \u201cThe Nolan films established the Batmobile as a tank, which was a brilliant idea,\u201d Reeves says. \u201cBut I thought, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be cool if this guy is a loner and a gearhead and fashioning these things by himself, taking parts of other cars and kit cars?\u2019 So it\u2019s recognisable as a car this time. But it\u2019s like a muscle car. One that he\u2019s made himself.\u201d\nReeves says it\u2019s daunting but also hugely exciting to see his Batman come to life \u2014 he is days away from finishing the film when this interview takes place in late 2021.\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of it. I felt it was the best version of the story that we could possibly do to justify having another Batman,\u201d he says. \u201cYou always have to have a reason, and from the beginning that was the mission for me.\u201d Sequels and Gotham City-based spin-offs are being planned. It\u2019s safe to assume they will remain Aquaman-free. At least for now. \u201cIt will obviously have a lot to do with how people receive this film,\u201d Reeves says. \u201cBut a lot of things are in the works.\u201d\nWhen Bruce Wayne/Batman first goes looking for criminals in Batman: Year One, there is one frame in which Reeves noted that \u201che\u2019s dressed in what I thought looked like an image out of Taxi Driver\u201d. Some of Frank Miller\u2019s notes to David Mazzucchelli are included at the back of a commemorative edition of Year One, published a few years ago. Of that same frame, Miller writes he wanted Batman \u201cto basically look like he\u2019s won a Taxi Driver-lookalike competition\u201d. Reeves laughed out loud when he read that. They were literally on the same page.\nAt the start of this article, there was one DC film we overlooked. One that bucked its run of rum luck \u2014 and did so in spectacular style. That film was 2019\u2019s double-Oscar-winning Joker. A key influence on that? Also Taxi Driver. Don\u2019t bet that Batman isn\u2019t about to rise again.\nThe Batman is released in cinemas on 4 March"

      "text": "The DC Extended Universe is finally giving Marvel a run for its money\u2014something that\u2019s bound to increase now that James Gunn is running the show. The DCEU\u2019s myriad projects stretch far beyond superhero mainstays Batman, Superman, and the Justice League, promising to include new and interesting takes on DC Comics\u2019 enormous stable of characters.\nWhat follows is an up-to-date list of everything DCEU-related that\u2019s on the way: DC movies heading to theaters, as well as DC streaming movies and shows coming to Max.\nLast updated 8/23/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next DC Movie?\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom\nRelease date: December 20 (in theaters)\nDirector James Wan returns for the next adventure following Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) as the newly crowned King of Atlantis. Now in his new role, Arthur will explore more of the world under the sea while also dealing with new threats from Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and others. Like Shazam 2, Aquaman 2 has endured its share of release-date changes, with its new Christmas 2023 date designed to give Wan and company ample time to complete all the necessary special effects.\nUpcoming DC Movie Release Dates\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\nRelease date: October 4, 2024 (in theaters)\nTodd Phillips never saw his Joker movie as anything but a singular film. But over a billion dollars at the box office and an Oscar for Best Actor (for star Joaquin Phoenix) obviously changed things. We have a few nuggets of info so far: the title is Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux(French for \u201cshared madness\u201d), Phoenix is returning and will co-star with Lady Gaga (who\u2019s playing Harley Quinn), Zazie Beetz is probably returning as Arthur Fleck\u2019s neighbor, and\u2026 it\u2019s likely going to be a musical? Filming wrapped in early April 2023.\nThe Batman 2\nRelease date: 2025 (in theaters)\nHot off the success of Matt Reeves\u2019 long-awaitedThe Batman, everyone involved made it clear that wasn\u2019t a one-and-done. Robert Pattinson\u2019s Batman will be back. Will he face off with the Joker? It\u2019s possible but not definitive. You\u2019d imagine the Penguin and Catwoman could be back too. We don\u2019t know much yet about this one, but we do know it won\u2019t be arriving until 2025.\nCurrent DC Shows\nDoom Patrol Season 4, Part 2\nRelease date: TBD 2023 (on Max)\nThe fourth and final season of Doom Patrol\u2014starring Brendan Fraser, Matt Bomer, Diane Guerrero, April Bowlby, Joivan Wade, Timothy Dalton, Skye Roberts, and Michelle Gomez\u2014already aired its first batch of episodes; the remaining six will return later this year.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows Without Release Dates\nThe Penguin\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nYou saw him in The Batman and now, Colin Farrell\u2019s Penguin is getting his own Max series. As of April 2023, the show is in production, with a cast that also includes Cristin Milioti, Rhenzy Feliz, Michael Kelly, Shohreh Aghdashloo, and Deirdre O\u2019Connell, with Clancy Brown and Michael Zegen recurring.\nPeacemaker Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nFrom the instant that opening credits scene rolled for the first time, DC fans and non-fans alike fell in love with Peacemaker. Well, he\u2019s coming back, still played by John Cena and still from the twisted mind of James Gunn. There\u2019s no word on when it\u2019ll happen but we\u2019re guessing 2024.\nSuperman: Legacy\nRelease date: July 11, 2025\nJames Gunn will write and direct this Superman movie, which is touted as not being an origin story. Casting announcements started with Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane, who\u2019ll be played by David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan. We also know Isabela Merced will play Hawkgirl, Edi Gathegi is Mister Terrific, and Nathan Fillion is a Green Lantern (Guy Gardner), as well as Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho.\nMore Upcoming DC Movies and Shows Announced for the Gunn/Safran Era\nThe shake-up at DC Studios got a huge zap of energy at the end of January, when James Gunn and Peter Safran announced their massive slate of planned projects. Little is known about most of these projects so far in terms of cast and crew and even release dates\u2014but we do have a few tidbits for each.\nCreature Commandos (An animated Max show) \u2013 A seven-episode animated series written by James Gunn himself. It stars Indira Varma (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Game of Thrones) as the Bride, who\u2019s the lead character, and Marvel veteran Frank Grillo as Rick Flagg Sr.\u2014father of Rick Flagg, played by Joel Kinnaman in The Suicide Squad. The rest of the cast includes David Harbour (Stranger Things) as Eric Frankenstein, Sean Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as G.I. Robot, Zoe Chao (The Afterparty) as Nina Mazursky, Alan Tudyk (Star Wars: Rogue One) as Dr. Phosphorus, Maria Bakalova (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as new character Princess Ilana Rostovic, and Peacemaker\u2019s Steve Agee and Sean Gunn returning as John Economos and Weasel, respectively.\nWaller (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Viola Davis will reprise her Suicide Squad character; the story will bring back characters from the Peacemaker show and tell a story with events set between Peacemaker seasons one and two.\nLanterns (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Set on Earth, this mystery series will follow Hal Jordan and John Stewart doing their thing as DC\u2019s \u201csuper cops.\u201d\nThe Authority (Theatrical film) \u2013 The Wildstorm superhero characters will make their big-screen debut in a film co-written by Gunn.\nParadise Lost (A live-action Max show) \u2013 How did Wonder Woman\u2019s world, Themyscira, come to be? Find out in this Game of Thrones-ish tale set before her birth.\nThe Brave and the Bold (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on the acclaimed Grant Morrison comic run, this will explore the story of Batman\u2019s son, Damien Wayne, and will feature \u201cother members of the extended Bat-family.\u201d\nBooster Gold (A live-action Max show) \u2013 The \u201closer from the future\u201d superhero character gets his own series.\nSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on Tom King\u2019s comics run, this movie will explore how Supergirl is different from Superman. It\u2019s not yet certain if Sasha Calle, who plays Supergirl in The Flash, will reprise the role here.\nSwamp Thing (Theatrical film) \u2013 The character\u2019s \u201cdark origins\u201d will be the focus of this one. DC does horror! Rumored but not yet confirmed to be directing, James Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) told Collider that he\u2019s slated to write the script.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows That Were Once in Development, But Whose Fate Is Unclear in the Gunn/Safran Era\nTa-Nehisi Coates and J.J. Abrams\u2019 Superman movie\nRelease date: Unknown (in theaters)\nThe news of Superman: Legacy cast uncertainty on this project from writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and producer J.J. Abrams. There hadn\u2019t been an update on this one in a while, but in late April, James Gunn himself told io9 that the two films don\u2019t necessarily cancel each other out: \u201cThat\u2019s an exciting movie \u2026 if it comes in and it\u2019s great \u2026 and if the timing is right, that could absolutely happen. That\u2019s totally unrelated. It would be an Elseworlds tale like Joker.\u201d\nMichael B. Jordan Superman Series\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nMichael B. Jordan was once developing a Superman take for Max as a limited series that would feature Val-Zod as opposed to Clark Kent. Again, there hasn\u2019t been an update in a while.\nStatic Shock\nRelease date: Unknown\nPart of the relaunch of the Milestone comic brand is this adaptation produced by, once again, Michael B. Jordan. A writer was hired back in 2021 to come up with a script and we haven\u2019t heard much since.\nJustice League Dark\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nJ.J. Abrams was among the people involved with bringing this evil super-team to life and while there hasn\u2019t been a ton of movement on the project of late, it\u2019s been around long enough that we\u2019d imagine it happens eventually.\nMetal Men\nRelease date: Unknown\nOne of the more recent pre-Gunn/Safran DC films to go into development, this is this tale of six beings based on various powerful metals. It\u2019s from directors Ron Clements and John Musker (Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Moana), so if it happens, it\u2019ll have an incredible pedigree.\nZatanna\nRelease date: Unknown\nLast year, Emerald Fennell won an Oscar for writing Promising Young Woman. She followed that up landing the job to write this DC superhero flick about the young magician. Like most of the films in this section, there hasn\u2019t been movement in a while.\nHourman\nRelease date: Unknown\nYes, the hero who takes a drug that makes him a hero for an hour was, back in 2021, rumored to be in development. Whether or not that\u2019s still the case is unknown but we figured it was worth noting.\nUntitled Arkham Show\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nIn addition to The Penguin, Matt Reeves has said he plans to expand the world of The Batman into Max shows. At one point, a series about Gotham PD was in the works, but now he says it might be more about the inner workings at Arkham Asylum. On October 25, The Staircase\u2019s Antonio Campos came aboard as a writer\u2014the third to hold that position on the potential series so far\u2014and may direct and serve as showrunner if the show happens, according to a report in Variety.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Shutdowns continue to sweep film and television, as alongside TV producers like Netflix, Amazon, Apple, and the CW, Disney and Universal have suspended production on nearly all of their live-action films.\nAs reported by the Hollywood Reporter and Variety, both studios, representing a significant section of the big-budget film market, have shut down production on their live-action films. The shut down affects the full live-action production slate for Universal and Disney, with Jurassic World: Dominion, Flint Strong, and an untitled Billy Eichner comedy being shut down on the Universal side alongside a half dozen or so Disney productions. Those productions include The Little Mermaid, Shrunk, the recently announced newest film in the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids series, the Disney Plus Home Alone reboot, and Peter Pan & Wendy. Shang-Chi had already been shut down earlier in the week as its director, Destin Daniel Cretton, self-isolated due to illness while awaiting the results of a test for covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus strain.\nIn a statement, a Disney spokesperson said, \u201cWhile there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on our productions, after considering the current environment and the best interests of our cast and crew, we have made the decision to pause production on some of our live-action films for a short time.\u201d\nhttps://gizmodo.com/netflix-warner-bros-apple-and-amazon-are-all-haltin-1842320189\nThe spokesperson added, \u201cWe will continue to assess the situation and restart as soon as feasible.\u201d\nThe shutdowns come after news of major delays in the release calendar for the companies as well, with Disney pushing back Mulan and New Mutants, a movie that honestly at this point I\u2019m concerned might be cursed. As of press time, Warner Bros. is continuing production on its current films, including The Matrix 4 and The Batman, though that could change at any time.\nUpdate 3:01pm: And according to Deadline, The Batman has now delayed its production in the UK by two weeks.\nFor more, make sure you\u2019re following us on our Instagram @io9dotcom."

      "text": "After an almost six-month shutdown due to the covid-19 pandemic, The Batman went back into production this week. It then took only three days for things to shut down again. That\u2019s when star Robert Pattinson tested positive for covid-19.\n\u201cA member of The Batman production has tested positive for Covid-19, and is isolating in accordance with established protocols. Filming is temporarily paused,\u201d a Warner Bros. spokesperson said initially. Soon after, Vanity Fair broke that the person was, in fact, Pattinson himself.\nio9 reached out to Warner Bros. and Pattinson\u2019s reps but had not heard back as of publication.\nThe actor is just the latest major star to reveal they\u2019ve contracted the disease. As recently as Wednesday night, Dwayne Johnson said his whole family had it but has since recovered. Statistics suggest it\u2019s likely Pattinson will recover too, but who knows if he spread it to other members of the production or not.\nWhile the delay of one movie, even a movie as big as The Batman, isn\u2019t a huge deal, it\u2019s yet another example of how trying to start the world back up before it\u2019s actually safe to do so could have serious or even deadly consequences. Film productions that have resumed are taking extensive measures to protect everyone involved from covid-19. The fact that Pattinson was tested at all is likely due to those measures. But if arguably the most prominent person on that film set\u2014the one in the Batsuit\u2014can get sick, anyone can get sick.\nThere\u2019s no word on how long the current shutdown on the film will last, but the aim is still for The Batman to open a little over a year from now, on October 1, 2021. The impressive first trailer, released last month, was culled from footage after only 25% of filming\u2014so once everyone is safe and healthy, it sure looks like writer-director Matt Reeves has a special film on his hands. Let\u2019s all hope he can finish it quickly and safely, and that Pattinson\u2019s recovery will be swift as well.\nFor more, make sure you\u2019re following us on our Instagram @io9dotcom."

      "text": "DC Films unveils superhero movie release plan including 6 titles per year The Warner Bros. division will use a multiverse approach to release up to six superhero movies a year across various platforms \u2014 but will fans embrace the creative chaos? By James Hibberd James Hibberd James Hibberd is the former editor at large at Entertainment Weekly. He left EW in 2021. EW's editorial guidelines Published on December 28, 2020 03:21PM EST DC Films is revealing an ambitious plan to try to catch up to Marvel Studios. The company's president, Walter Hamada, told The New York Times on Sunday that the Warner Bros. division plans to release \"up to four\" superhero titles per year in theaters starting in 2022, and another two feature films annually for the HBO Max streaming service. By noting that \"the most expensive\" movies will be released in theaters and the less costly titles will go to HBO Max, the announcement suggests the company is backing away from its recently announced controversial 2021 strategy of releasing movies in theaters and on HBO Max at the same time. Last week, Wonder Woman 1984 became the first major title to get the hybrid treatment when it debuted on the service on Christmas Day. Numbers are not available as to how the sequel performed on the service, but the film has grossed $85 million at the box office, largely overseas. Warner Bros. Pictures HBO Max will still be a major consideration moving forward, with Hamada saying, \"With every movie that we're looking at now, we are thinking, 'What's the potential Max spin-off?'\" TV spin-offs based on the upcoming films The Batman (2022) and The Suicide Squad (2021) are already in the works. The plan also put in perhaps the clearest terms yet the company's intention to employ a storytelling multiverse in order to generate a higher volume of diverse content. The multiverse premise will be introduced on the big screen in the upcoming The Flash (2022), starring Ezra Miller (who also made an appearance in the CW's recent superhero crossover event). The storytelling loophole serves as a way to permit different actors to play the same character in various franchises at the same time without violating canon (such as Ben Affleck and Michael Keaton both reprising the role of Batman in different upcoming films). The multiverse strategy is considered a somewhat precarious move, as it risks turning DC Films' increasingly disparate story lines into a universe that's even more confusing and chaotic. The CW has dabbled in the multiverse already, and while it has resulted in many fun moments, it also got pretty messy \u2014 even with dozens of hours per season and five shows to sort it all out. DC will be double downing on taking independent creative approaches to its material, even as Marvel's careful planning has helped grow the MCU into a massively successful empire (grossing more than $22 billion worldwide), and its organized effort has proven to be a winning formula. DC's move could alienate the genre's most devout fans who like a sense of cohesion to their superhero storytelling, and it could leave its films feeling less consequential \u2014 what does it matter what happens to a beloved character if there's always another version of that character in a multiverse to switch over to, as if they're all in a gonzo episode of Rick and Morty? On the other hand, Marvel is dipping a toe into the multiverse approach as well (e.g., with its upcoming Loki miniseries for Disney+ and its Doctor Strange sequel). And DC's approach could be creatively liberating, especially when compared to Marvel's regimented sameness. Using a multiverse, it would be easier for Warner Bros. to justify more titles like 2019's acclaimed drama Joker, which is an utterly distinct entry from all the other Batman-universe films and was an R-rated box office success. Also, given the company's struggles to find its footing, DC's approach might be what it needs to find the right voice and tone to rally around in a more consolidated way \u2014 a smash-hit franchise-starter might not emerge on DC's Earth 1 or Earth 2\u2026 but perhaps on Earth 3 or Earth 4? Somewhere in the multiverse is a place where DC Films is the studio on top.

      "text": "At a Glance:\nDoctor Who ended the eras of both Chris Chibnall as series showrunner and Jodie Whittaker as the 13th Doctor in 2022 with \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d bringing to a close a three-season, three-special run.\nWhittaker\u2019s replacement is returning star David Tennant. He will play the official 14th incarnation of the Doctor under returning showrunner Russell T. Davies, who revived Doctor Who in 2005 and managed the series until 2009.\nTennant will appear in three specials in November 2023 to coincide with the 60th anniversary of Doctor Who on November 23.\nHe\u2019ll be joined by returning characters Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, who were played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins in season four of Doctor Who. Neil Patrick Harris will play a new villain, while Heartstopper\u2019s Yasmin Finney will play a character named Rose.\nTennant will be succeeded by Sex Education\u2019s Ncuti Gatwa as the 15th Doctor. His announcement in May 2022 makes him the first Black male actor to play the character on-screen.\nGatwa will star in Doctor Who\u2019s 14th season, set to air some time in 2024.\nMillie Gibson will co-star as the 15th Doctor\u2019s companion.\nGame of Thrones star Indira Varma will play a mysterious character known as \u201cthe Duchess.\u201d\nDoctor Who\u2019s beloved tradition of doing a Christmas Special\u2014no more New Year\u2019s Day Specials, in other words\u2014will return in 2023, with another confirmed for 2024.\nComedian Sooz Kempner will star in Doom\u2019s Day, a new transmedia Doctor Who campaign tied into the anniversary. She\u2019ll play Doom, the titular intergalactic assassin, who has found herself hunted by Death itself\u2014and must use a purloined vortex manipulator with a day\u2019s worth of time-jumping charge to find the Doctor and save herself.\nThis post was last updated 5/30/23.\nWhat\u2019s Been Going on in Doctor Who?\nThree Doctor Who specials aired out the last days of Jodie Whittaker\u2019s time as the Doctor in 2022. \u201cEve of the Daleks\u201d saw the Doctor and her companions Dan (introduced in the prior 13th season, known as Doctor Who: Flux) and Yaz facing the titular iconic monsters in a time loop paradox. \u201cLegend of the Sea Devils\u201d revived the classic \u201870s monsters for a new adventure, while \u201cPower of the Doctor\u201d saw the 13th Doctor face off against the Master in an adventure that ultimately saw her mortally wounded, returning her companions to contemporary Earth while she regenerated into a new body.\nWhy Is David Tennant the Doctor Again? Is David Tennant Playing the 10th Doctor?\nWhittaker regenerated not into previously announced new Doctor Ncuti Gatwa, but David Tennant, who played the official 10th incarnation of the Time Lord from Christmas 2005 to New Year\u2019s Day 2010, before reprising the role for Doctor Who\u2019s 50th anniversary special, \u201cThe Day of the Doctor,\u201d in 2013.\nWhile this marks his first return on-screen in the series since then, Tennant will not be playing the 10th Doctor, but the official 14th incarnation\u2014and the character will be aware that they are both using a familiar form and are a new entity. Aside from the fact that Tennant is arguably the most popular actor to take on the role, so bringing him back for the 60th anniversary makes sense, there\u2019s plenty of reasons Doctor Who can come up with as to why the Doctor\u2019s regenerative process decided to re-use an old identity, more of which you can read about here.\nWhen Will Doctor Who Return in 2023?\nDoctor Who will return for three special episodes in November 2023, set to air in celebration of the series\u2019 60th anniversary.\nWhat Is Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary Special About?\nAside from Tennant returning as the Doctor, he\u2019ll be joined by former companions Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins (the actor\u2019s last role prior to his passing in July 2022) in Doctor Who\u2019s fourth season. Donna exited the series as a regular character after an adventure lead to her needing to have her memory wiped by the 10th Doctor, forgetting her time alongside him lest her mind face grievous harm, so just how Donna will play into the the story remains to be seen.\nThe Doctor and Donna will face a mysterious new adversary, played by Neil Patrick Harris, and will be joined in the specials by Yasmin Finney as a new character named Rose. How Finney\u2019s Rose might connect to the other famous Rose of Doctor Who, Billie Piper\u2019s Rose Tyler, also remains to be seen.\nIs There a Trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary?\nThe first premiered at the end of \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d and you can watch it above. The second premiered in December and you can watch it here:\nWhen Will Ncuti Gatwa Become the Doctor?\nGatwa is briefly seen in the trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th anniversary, so will presumably follow the long tradition of new Doctors appearing in the final moments of their predecessor\u2019s last episodes to become the 15th Doctor. The BBC has announced that Gatwa will appear as the Doctor first \u201cover the festive season\u201d in 2023, before he takes over full-time in a new season of the show after that.\nIs There a Doctor Who Season 14 Release Date?\nThere\u2019s no current release date for season 14 of Doctor Who, but it is expected to be broadcast some time in 2024.\nWhere Is Doctor Who Streaming in the U.S. and UK?\nCurrently, the first 13 seasons of the revived Doctor Who are streaming on the BBC iPlayer in the UK; in the U.S., the revived series streams exclusively on HBO Max. In both countries, episodes from the classic era of the show are available through Britbox.\nThis will change in 2023, at least in the U.S. The BBC and Disney have announced that as part of a new deal, Doctor Who will stream exclusively worldwide on Disney+, except for in the UK and Ireland, where it will still stream on the BBC iPlayer and BBC One. It\u2019s currently unknown if this will affect Doctor Who\u2019s place on BBC America, where it currently airs in the U.S..\nDoes Disney Co-Own Doctor Who Now?\nA report in the wake of the BBC/Disney announcement from British paper the Telegraph alleged that the deal will also see Disney contribute finances to help create the show, and while the series\u2019 creative team will still hold control of the series primarily, the deal will allow Disney some level of say in the creative decisions for the series\u2014as well as allowing access to talent or \u201ccinematic production moments\u201d previously inaccessible due to the BBC\u2019s budget for the show.\nNone of this has been confirmed by the BBC, however. The announcement strictly focused on Disney\u2019s acquisition of Doctor Who\u2019s streaming rights, and did not mention any co-owning. The new era of the series will be made for the BBC by Bad Wolf Studios, created by former Doctor Who producer Julie Gardner and former BBC Controller of Fiction Jane Tranter\u2014which is now owned by Sony Pictures Television, after the studio took a majority stake in Bad Wolf in December 2021. The series was previously made by BBC Studios directly.\nIn January, Davies did say that Doctor Who is now working with a bigger budget, telling GQ that Disney\u2019s involvement came about as part of \u201cthe BBC\u2019s notion to go for a streamer to invest in the show worldwide \u2026 We\u2019re not on the budget level with Star Wars and the Marvel shows, [but] it\u2019s better than it was \u2026 We\u2019re not allowed to talk about budget\u2026 but it\u2019s more than I\u2019ve ever had to work with.\u201d\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "With San Diego Comic-Con being mostly a bust and Star Wars Celebration canceled, fans hoping for a weekend of fun geek news turn their heads to Warner Bros. On August 22, it\u2019s hosting DC FanDome, a 24-hour online event that promises to be as close to a Hall H experience as one can get.\nToday, Warner Bros revealed some additional details about the event, the biggest news of which is a hefty list of names who\u2019ll be attending in one way or another. Looking at who\u2019s attending, you get a pretty good idea about what projects we\u2019re going to learn more about. That list includes Robert Pattinson and Matt Reeves from The Batman, Ezra Miller and Andy Muschetti from The Flash, Dwayne Johnson from Black Adam, Zachary Levi and David F. Sandberg from Shazam 2, James Gunn, Margot Robbie, and everyone from The Suicide Squad, Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Kristen Wiig, and Patty Jenkins from Wonder Woman 1984, Zack Snyder from, well, \u201cThe Snyder Cut,\u201d and James Wan from Aquaman 2.\nhttps://gizmodo.com/dc-weaponizes-john-williams-superman-theme-to-hype-its-1844620049\nAnd that\u2019s just the movies. From the TV side, there\u2019s Titans\u2019 Brenton Thwaites, the Flash himself, Grant Gustin as well as Candice Patton, Doom Patrol\u2019s Abigail Shapiro, April Bowlby, and Diane Guerrero, Harley Quinn\u2019s Kaley Cuoco and Lake Bell, Legends of Tomorrow\u2019s Caity Lotz, the list goes on and on.\nThankfully, WB hasn\u2019t forgotten about its comic book writers and artists! Brian Michael Bendis, G. Willow Wilson, Geoff Johns, Cecil Castellucci, Grant Morrison, Kami Garcia, Jim Lee, Mairghread Scott, Marc Guggenheim, Nicola Scott, Neil Gaiman, and Vita Ayala are just some of the creators who will appear.

      "text": "From Batfleck\u2026to Patman. Twilight star Robert Pattinson is in talks to play Batman for Matt Reeves in his upcoming film, The Batman.\nVariety broke the news and while initial reports made it sound like it was definitive, the trade has since updated to say that \u201cit\u2019s not yet a done deal, Pattinson is the top choice and it\u2019s expected to close shortly. Warner Bros. had no comment.\u201d\nDeadline even added the wrinkle that Nicholas Hoult is still in the mix, though its report suggests it will be Pattinson too.\nSo it seems most likely that Pattinson is the new Batman, which is sure to spark an insane amount of debate and discussion. Any time an actor is cast as Batman, it\u2019s a landmark moment, and here we have one again.\nReeves has been working on the script for The Batman for some time, with an eye on a June 25, 2021 release date. He\u2019s still working on the script, in fact, but this news makes it clear things are starting to heat up on the film, which he describes as more of a detective story than a superhero movie:\nIt\u2019s very much a point of view-driven, noir Batman tale. It\u2019s told very squarely on his shoulders, and I hope it\u2019s going to be a story that will be thrilling but also emotional. It\u2019s more Batman in his detective mode than we\u2019ve seen in the films. The comics have a history of that. He\u2019s supposed to be the world\u2019s greatest detective, and that\u2019s not necessarily been a part of what the movies have been. I\u2019d love this to be one where when we go on that journey of tracking down the criminals and trying to solve a crime, it\u2019s going to allow his character to have an arc so that he can go through a transformation.\nPattinson, of course, first gained notoriety for his role as Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. He was then cast as Edward in the Twilight saga, instantly shooting him to superstardom. After those five movies finished, he began taking roles in smaller, riskier independent films like David Cronenberg\u2019s Cosmopolis, Claire Denis\u2019 High Life, and Josh and Benny Safdie\u2019s Good Time. However, he was recently cast in Christopher Nolan\u2019s mysterious new action film\u2014and now, by playing Bruce Wayne, it\u2019s clear Pattinson is ready to take a whole new leap with his career.\nAt 33 years old, Pattinson is slightly older than Christian Bale was when he was cast as the Caped Crusader, but younger than Ben Affleck, Michael Keaton, and Adam West were when they took on the iconic role. It\u2019s just as Reeves had been hinting: He\u2019s going to a younger Batman, and it\u2019s going to be very interesting to see how long can keep the cowl.\nHoly shit everyone. We probably have our new Batman. What do you think?\nUpdate: May 16 9:20 p.m.\nThis post was updated minutes after initial publication with the news that the deal has yet to close.\nFor more, make sure you\u2019re following us on our new Instagram @io9dotcom."

      "text": "Thanks to its feature in The Batman, the latest DC Bat-movie starring Robert Pattinson, a deep cut from Nirvana\u2019s classic 1991 album Nevermind has been surging in streams since the film\u2019s release on Friday, March 4, according to initial reports to MRC Data.\nThe song in question, \u201cSomething in the Way,\u201d appears twice in the film, and also appeared in trailers leading up to its release. The trailer synch actually helped the song debut on Billboard\u2019s charts for the first time in September 2020. It reached No. 2 on Rock Digital Song Sales and No. 45 on the all-genre Digital Song Sales ranking (dated Sept. 5) in the first tracking week after the trailer\u2019s release.\nSince the film\u2019s theatrical release, though, the song has seen an explosion in its streaming numbers, according to initial reports to MRC Data. In the first four days of The Batman\u2019s release (encompassing Friday, March 4 through Monday, March 7), \u201cSomething In The Way\u201d earned 3.1 million on-demand official U.S. streams. That number is up from 372,000 on-demand official U.S. streams from the prior four days (Feb. 28 through March 3). That\u2019s a 734% increase over the given period. Its steady growth also helped it crack the top 5 of Spotify\u2019s Daily USA Top 50 songs ranking on Tuesday.\nTrending on Billboard\nThe sharpest overnight growth of the song occurred from Sunday, March 6, to Monday, March 7. It tallied 808,000 streams on Sunday, and then surged to 1.5 million the following day. That\u2019s an 86% increase.\nDaily On-Demand Official U.S. Streaming Totals For Nirvana\u2019s \u201cSomething In The Way\u201d\nFeb. 28: 72,000, according to initial reports to MRC Data\nMarch 1: 78,000\nMarch 2: 99,000\nMarch 3: 123,000\nMarch 4*: 291,000\nMarch 5: 505,000\nMarch 6: 808,000\nMarch 7: 1.5 million\nMarch 8: 1.6 million\n(*indicates the theatrical release date of The Batman)\nNevermind spent two weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 1992. It marked the group\u2019s first of four No. 1 albums, and spawned three Billboard Hot 100-charting singles: \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d (No. 6 peak), \u201cCome As You Are\u201d (No. 32) and \u201cLithium\u201d (No. 64). The group only returned to the Hot 100 once more afterwards, in 2002, with \u201cYou Know You\u2019re Right,\u201d a previously-unreleased track from 1994 that appears on the group\u2019s self-titled greatest hits album.\n\u201cWhen I write, I listen to music, and as I was writing the first act, I put on Nirvana\u2019s \u2018Something in the Way,\u2019\u201d Batman director Matt Reeves told Empire in December. \u201cThat\u2019s when it came to me that, rather than make Bruce Wayne the playboy version we\u2019ve seen before, there\u2019s another version who had gone through a great tragedy and become a recluse. So I started making this connection to Gus Van Sant\u2019s Last Days, and the idea of this fictionalized version of Kurt Cobain being in this kind of decaying manor.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Nirvana\u2019s deep cut has appeared in a popular film. It appeared in the 2005 Sam Mendes film Jarhead and a brief cover appears in Cameron Crowe\u2019s 1996 comedy Jerry Maguire."

      "text": "\u201cStar Wars! Nothing but Star Wars! Give me those Star Wars! Don\u2019t let them end\u2026\u201d Just as Bill Murray said it in 1978, we\u2019re still saying it today. Star Wars is everywhere these days, with multiple movies and TV shows in the works from Disney and Lucasfilm. This article will give you the most up-to-date Star Wars release dates so you know exactly when every new Star Wars movie or Disney+ show will arrive.\nWhat are the next three movies? What TV shows are coming up? Have any TV shows or movies been canceled? What are people saying about what\u2019s next? We\u2019ve got you covered on all things in a galaxy far, far away.\nThis post was last updated on 9/13/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next Star Wars movie?\nSharmeen Obaid-Chioy\u2019s New Jedi Order Film Film\nRelease Date: TBD, but May 26, 2026, December 18, 2026 or December 17, 2027 (In Theaters)\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023 in London, Lucasfilm announced that three Star Wars movies are now in the works.\nJames Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) will direct a film 25,000 years before any known Star Wars timeline about the first Jedi to use the Force.\nDave Filoni will direct a film that\u2019s kind of the Star Wars Disney+ Avengers, telling the story of a climactic event meeting the stories of The Book of Boba Fett, The Mandalorian, Ahsoka and more in the time between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens.\nAnd Sharmeen Obaid-Chioy will direct a film set 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker following Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she creates a New Jedi Order.\nThis last one, we think, is the film that Damon Lindelof (Lost, The Leftovers, Watchmen) was co-writingwith Justin Britt-Gibson before departing the project. Steven Knight is now reportedly writing.\nA week after the news of these films first broke, it began to seem like the Rey project by Obaid-Chioy could be the first one out of the gate. However, in June, Disney shuffled its release schedule and moved its December 2025 Star Wars movie to May 2026, and added a third Star Wars movie to the schedule in December 2026. So maybe these three movies are on those dates. We\u2019ll see.\nUpcoming Star Wars release dates\nThese shows and movies have all been officially announced and are in various stages of production, even if we don\u2019t know when they will definitely come out.\nStar Wars: Ahsoka\nRelease Date: Now Playing (On Disney+)\nThe first full live-action Ahsoka Tano show from co-creator Dave Filoni is finally here. Rosario Dawson is, of course, returning. And our first look at footage confirmed that actress Natasha Liu Bordizzo has been cast as Sabine Wren; more recently, Eman Esfandi was confirmed as Ezra Bridger. At Star Wars Celebration this year we learned Mary Elizabeth Winstead is playing Hera Syndulla, Lars Mikkelsenis playing Grand Admiral Thrawn and Wes Chatham is his right-hand man.\nWhat does that all mean? Well, in the first teaser trailer, you can see she\u2019ll make good onthe Star Wars Rebels finale and go after Thrawn. And what about the fact she knows Luke Skywalker now? And how does Ray Stevenson\u2019s lightsaber-wielding character fit in?\nThe show is now airing on Disney+ and here you can read our weekly recaps:\nEpisode 1, \u201cMaster and Apprentice: and Episode 2, \u201cToil and Trouble\u201d\nEpisode 6, premiering September 19\nEpisode 7, premiering September 26\nEpisode 7, premiering October 3\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\nRelease Date: 2023 (On Disney+)\nCreated by Spider-Man Homecoming/Far From Home/No Way Home director Jon Watts along with writer Chris Ford, this mystery Star Wars show is now currently in development. The title for the show was released during the Star Wars Celebration, and was previously internally referred as \u201cGrammar Radio.\u201d Celebration also revealed its headlining star, Jude Law.\nSet after the events of Return of the Jedi, Skeleton Crew is described as an adventure in the mold of Amblin adventures of the 1980s. The show will be about seeing the galaxy through the eyes of children (but it is not a kids show), and will follow a group of children who get lost in the galaxy and try to find their way home. Jon Watts explained that the series will take place during the same time period as the upcoming Ahsoka series and The Mandalorian.\nFilming on the series began in 2022 and ended in early 2023. And though not much is know about what happens on the show,it has been revealed that The Daniels, the Oscar-winning directors of Everything Everywhere All At Once, directed an episode. Ditto David Lowery, who did the film The Green Knight. Read more about the show here.\nio9 saw the first footage at Star Wars Celebration 2023 and you can read about it here. Three of the main stars of the show are played by Ravi Cabot-Conyers, Kyriana Kratter, and Robert Timothy Smit. Rumors suggest it could debut in November or December 2023.\nStar Wars: The Acolyte\nRelease Date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nRussian Doll co-creator Leslye Headland will be the first person to bring the excellent High Republic timeline into live-action with this show, long rumored to star Amandla Stenberg before an actual confirmation finally arrived at San Diego Comic-Con 2022\u2014one of few Star Wars bits of news to emerge from the convention.\nIn an interview in 2022, Headland revealed the show would be about 100 years before the events of The Phantom Menace. \u201cA lot of those characters haven\u2019t even been born yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a look at the political and personal and spiritual things that came up in a time period that we don\u2019t know much about. My question when watching The Phantom Menace was always like, \u2018Well, how did things get to this point?\u2019 How did we get to a point where a Sith lord can infiltrate the Senate and none of the Jedi pick up on it? Like, what went wrong? What are the scenarios that led us to this moment?\u201d\nIn an interview released later, Headland spoke about her goals for the series. For Headland, above all else The Acolyte is a mystery, and that mystery is figuring out what is going on in this peak period. It was also suggested that The Acolyte will bring more elements from the Expanded Universe to canon, but what parts that will be incorporated will remain to be seen.\nIn September 2022, both Jodie Turner-Smith and Squid Game\u2019s Emmy-winning Lee Jung-Jae joined the cast, with an official announcement in November adding Carrie-Anne Moss, Manny Jacinto, and others to the roster. The first image, which you see above, was released in November and you can read about the first footage here, which was shown at Star Wars Celebration 2023.\nAnd no, despite what bullcrap rumors you may have been reading online, the show has not been canceled.\nAndor: Season 2\nRelease Date: August 2024 (On Disney+)\nSeason one of Tony Gilroy\u2019s Rogue One prequel starring Diego Luna showed an excitingly different side of Star Wars. Season two will reportedly be spread across the four years leading up to Rogue One, with four episodes covering each year in Cassian Andor\u2019s life until that fateful point. Filming began in late 2022.\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023, Gilroy announced the show should be out in August 2024 and showed fans the first footage from the season. Read about it here. Plus, the final episodes of the season/series will take place just days before Rogue One, leading right into that story.\nOne minor hiccup though, due to the Writer\u2019s Guild strike, showrunner and head writer Tony Gilroy left his duties show in May 2023. He\u2019s unlikely to return until the Writer\u2019s Strike is over, which could cause a delay.\nStar Wars: A Droid Story\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nLucasfilm Animation is teaming up with Industrial Light and Magic for this streaming show that will \u201cintroduce us to a new hero, guided by legendary duo R2-D2 and C-3PO.\u201d We don\u2019t know anything beyond that and there hasn\u2019t been a significant update in years, which could be a good thing or bad thing.\nStar Wars: Lando\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nWay back in December 2020, Disney announced a bunch of Star Wars TV shows. Among them was a Lando show which, at the time, was going to be made by Dear White People creator Justin Simien. After that, things went quiet for about three years. Then,in an April 2023 article, Donald Glover hinted that he\u2019s still interested and it\u2019s still possible in the works. A May 2023 interview with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed it\u2019s still in the works.\nThe first significant update in almost three years came in July when news broke that Simien has been off the project since he started working on Haunted Mansion, and not only is Donald Glover going to star in the series, he\u2019s co-writing it with his brother Stephen.\nUntitled Taika Waititi Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nIn May 2020, news broke that Oscar-winning director of Thor: Ragnarok would be helming and co-writing along with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. \u201cTaika\u2019s approach to Star Wars will be fresh, unexpected, and \u2026 unique,\u201d Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said. \u201cHis enormous talent and sense of humor will ensure that audiences are in for an unforgettable ride.\u201d\nThere was a time when this was likely to be the next Star Wars film but, after Star Wars Celebration 2023, it seems like it\u2019s now on the back burner. That was confirmed by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy who said the Oscar-winner is still working on the film, it\u2019s just going slowly.\nIn the past, Waititi has discussed some broad ideas of what he wants to do with his upcoming film. Read those below.\nTaika Waititi Doesn\u2019t Want Star Wars to Rely on Legacies\nAre You as Confused About Taika Waititi\u2019s Star WarsMovie as We Are?\nUntitled Dave Filoni Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nWe mentioned this one above but, at some point, Dave Filoni will be directing a film that is meant to be a climactic event wrapping up stories that have begun on shows he\u2019s involved with such as The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, The Book of Boba Fett, Skeleton Crew and others.\nUntitled James Mangold Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nThis was one of the three films announced at Star Wars Celebration but, like Filoni\u2019s, isn\u2019t likely to be next. This one is set 25,000 years before the original trilogy and tells the story of the first person to use the Force.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about, I want to be part of the saga, but I also don\u2019t want to be holding so much lore in the air that you can hardly tell a story,\u201d Mangold told io9 when asked about this film. \u201cAnd what I really wanted to do\u2026was just can we make a kind of the Ten Commandments of the Force, you know? A kind of origin story of how the Force came to be known, understood, wielded, and harnessed.\u201d We love this idea so much we even wrote about it.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Haven\u2019t Been Officially Announced, But We Think Are Still Happening\nThe Mandalorian Season 4\nRelease Date: TBD\nWith The Mandalorian Season 3 now in the books, all eyes look ahead to season 4. However, the season has not yet been officially announced. Unofficially though, series creator Jon Favreau said he\u2019s already written a fourth season which he probably wouldn\u2019t have done just for fun. It\u2019s coming. It\u2019s just a matter of when, especially with writers and actors on strike.\nThe Book of Boba Fett Season 2\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nThe Book of Boba Fett season one ended with the implication that we\u2019d see more of these character in the future. But alas, there has been no official announcement\u2026 yet. Dive into the making-of season one while we wait and ponder the words of executive producer Robert Rodriguez who said he knows when the character is coming back, but he can\u2019t say when.\nUntitled Shawn Levy Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nShawn Levy, the prolific director and producer behind Stranger Things, Night at the Museum, and Free Guy is gearing up to develop a film in a galaxy far far away. He\u2019ll focus on that after completing Deadpool 3, which stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Probably NOT Going To Happen\nStar Wars: Rangers of the New Republic\nOriginally announced alongside shows like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka, and Andor, Rangers of the New Republic was rumored to be Cara Dune\u2019s show which would tie into The Mandalorian and Book of Boba Fett. However, with actress Gina Carano no longer a part of Star Wars, word on the street is this will no longer be happening. Nothing is official though.\nUntitled Rian Johnson Trilogy\nLet\u2019s be honest. Do we think this is happening anymore? Probably not. Rian Johnson has moved on to other things. But, until we hear otherwise (and no one is officially saying), we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t mention that before the divisive release of The Last Jedi, Lucasfilm officially said Johnson would make his very own trilogy. It hasn\u2019t officially been canceled yet but, in a new interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy suggested that it\u2019s been placed on the back burner as Johnson does other things. With Johnson\u2019s next film, Glass Onion, set for release in late 2022 though, he\u2019s been quoted saying he still hopes these movies happen. So do we.\nStar Wars: Rogue Squadron\nFor several years, Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins\u2019 film about pilots in the Star Wars universe has been earmarked as the next film. Well, that\u2019s no longer the case. After months of rumors suggesting it might move off its 2023 release date, Disney officially took it off the schedule. On December 13 2022, Jenkins said the movie is still in \u201cactive development\u201d but recent news suggests it\u2019s dead. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy disagrees, saying in May 2023 it\u2019s still on the books.\nUntitled Kevin Feige Movie\nMarvel Studios President Kevin Feige is best known for helping create the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But as much as he loves Marvel, he loves Star Wars even more. And so it was exciting to hear that he was producing a Star Wars movie and even recruited Loki and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness writer Michael Waldron to help him. Feige doesn\u2019t like to even acknowledge this project though and in a 2022 interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy also tiptoed around the project\u2019s existence. Then, a few weeks before Star Wars Celebration 2023, we learned the project is likely dead.\nFor more, check out io9\u2019s list of every canceled (or re-worked) Disney Star Wars project.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "In the wake of Superman taking over the summer, Warner Bros. is maintaining its momentum at DC Studios, announcing that Matt Reeves\u2019 highly anticipated The Batman Part II will begin filming next spring, aiming for an October 2027 release window.\nAccording to Variety, today\u2019s update comes following a Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders meeting (ahead of the company\u2019s split once more into two companies, Warner Bros. and, well, Discovery, next year), where executives lauded the financial success of James Gunn\u2019s Superman, earning just south of $550 million worldwide and formally kickstarting a new era for the DC Universe in the realm of film and TV. In their merriment diving into money like Scrooge McDuck, Warner Bros. also gave a rundown of its queue of superhero film projects, confirming The Batman Part II\u2018s production update in the process.\n\u201cIn film, James Gunn is busy preparing the next installments of the DC super family, including Supergirl (2026), Clayface (2026), and the next Wonder Woman,\u201d Warner Bros. said. \u201cIn addition, The Batman II (2027) is preparing to begin shooting next spring, among several other projects in development. The 10-year vision for the DC universe also includes an exciting array of television projects, including The Penguin, the upcoming new season of Peacemaker, and the debut of Lanterns in 2026. In a precise and measured way, the DC franchise will increasingly overlay across the studio\u2019s broader efforts: from film and TV to consumer products, games, experiences, and social.\u201d\nIt goes without saying that DC fans have been waiting for the sequel to the Caped Crusader film for a minute. The Batman, starring Robert Pattinson, was first released back in March 2022. Grossing $722 million worldwide at the box office, Warner Bros. announced sequel plans that April. The film also famously saw delays, leading fans and actor Pattinson to worry about whether he\u2019d be too old by the time filming commenced. Fortunately, The Penguin, starring Colin Farrell and Cristin Milioti, not only satisfied fans waiting for more Reeves-flavored comic book drama, but also cemented itself as one of the best DC shows ever, tiding folks over during their Batman drought.\nAlthough Batman\u2019s place in James Gunn\u2019s reimagined DC Universe has proved to be the studio head\u2019s biggest problem\u2014especially with Gunn confirming that Matt Reeves\u2019 films fall under the \u201cElseworlds\u201d banner, separate from DC Studios\u2019 10-year continuity plan\u2014Gunn has publicly backed Reeves. Amid his Superman media blitz, Gunn has taken time for fireside chats to reassure fans and address concerns about The Batman Part II\u2019s future. Granted, his updates were tantamount to telling folks to hop off Reeves\u2019 nuts and let him cook.\nIn late June, The Batman Part II showed signs of progress when Reeves and co-writer Mattson Tomlin shared a photo of the script. Gunn mentioned that he saw the script in July and thought it was \u201cgreat.\u201d With the bat due to be out of the cave soon, it\u2019ll be interesting to see the pendulum swing the other way as folks start pestering Gunn about the status of scripts for other upcoming DC projects.\nStill, it\u2019s a relief to see DC Studios prioritizing solid scripts over being beholden to a shoot-as-you-write style of filmmaking. We\u2019re eager to find out which grunge band Bruce Wayne will be brooding to in the Batmobile come 2027.\nWant more io9 news?
