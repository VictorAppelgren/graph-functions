For example, “US real rates are ~4 % vs euro 2 % (policy reaction: Fed tightening → higher borrowing costs → corporate margin compression).”  \n4. **Define regimes & transition conditions**: clearly label the current “post‑pandemic cost‑tightening regime” and the “future workforce‑investment regime” with thresholds (e.g., “if layoffs exceed 5 % of workforce, morale drops 10 % → productivity loss [ID 4LQD15CFU]”).  \n5. **Causal chain to pricing**: diagram (textually) how policy → cost inputs → product mix → earnings → equity valuation (e.g., tariffs → higher component costs → lower margins → lower EV stock multiples).  \n6. **Include specific catalysts/triggers/invalidation**: list “tariff adjustments in Q3 2025”, “EV tax‑credit phase‑out by 2026”, “Fed rate hikes >0.25 %”, “labor‑market shock >3 % unemployment”.  \n7. **Reconcile conflicting data**: if Tesla’s gross margin is cited as 17.9 % in one source and 17.2 % in another, note the time‑frame difference and use the most recent figure.  \n8. **Avoid generic platitudes**: replace “companies that treat employees as partners outperform peers” with the quantified 17.3 % outperformance of the JUST Capital Workers Leaders Index vs Russell 1000 [ID 4LQD15CFU].  \n9. **Structure per Section Focus**: start with a multi‑year structural thesis, then first‑principles anchors, regimes, causal chain, base case, risks, watch list, confidence.  \n10. **Maintain length/format**: keep the revised paragraph under ~250 words, using bullet‑style sub‑headings if needed for clarity.",
