On August 25, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised the price target on the stock to $345.00 (from $290.00) while maintaining a Buy rating.

  "content": "Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the AI Stocks Analysts Say You Shouldn\u2019t Ignore. On August 25, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised the price target on the stock to $345.00 (from $290.00) while maintaining a Buy rating. The rating affirmation reflects the firm\u2019s optimism regarding Broadcom\u2019s artificial intelligence momentum as it heads into fiscal third-quarter earnings.\n\nSet to report on September 4th, Wall Street analysts anticipate the semiconductor and software giant to report earnings of $1.66 in Q3, compared to $1.24 in the same quarter last year. Its revenue for Q3 is also expected to rise 21% year-over-year to $15.82 billion.\n\nArcuri has particularly noted in-line results for AVGO but expects the company to raise guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. Google\u2019s newest AI chip, the TPUv6p, which rely on Broadcom\u2019s custom silicon, are ramping up and notably the cause for the expected raised guidance.\n\nIt is also anticipated that TPUv6p will witness a sharp acceleration in the second half of 2025, extending into 2026. Wafer requirements for these chips are also likely to increase by 51% year-over-year, with overall momentum translating to a 60% year-over-year increase in the company\u2019s AI revenue for 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, AI-related networking will potentially ramp-up in fiscal 2026 as Ethernet architecture deployment increases. Arcuri also believes that Broadcom will reaffirm a $60 to $90 billion serviceable addressable market for custom chips.\n\nBroadcom is a technology company uniquely positioned in the AI revolution owing to its custom chip offerings and networking assets.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 10 Must-Watch AI Stocks for Investors and 10 AI Stocks Hit with New Analyst Ratings",

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock. It\u2019s not riding on hope.\nIt\u2019s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.\nThis is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!\nThe Reveal: Our Top Short-Term Stock Pick for 2025\nThis is the moment when most newsletters put up a paywall and ask you to spend $99.99 to find out the name of the stock.\nBut we\u2019re not doing that today.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nAt Insider Monkey, we believe in earning your trust first\u2014by delivering real value, upfront.

      "text": "In May 2025, US President Donald Trump announced massive investment commitments from the Gulf, including those from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The investments, worth more than $2 trillion, have begun materializing on ground.\nIn latest news, Bloomberg News has reported that Humain, Saudi Arabia\u2019s new artificial intelligence company, has begun construction of its first data centers in the kingdom. The AI startup plans to bring the data centers online in early 2026 using semiconductors imported from the U.S.\nAccording to CEO Tareq Amin, the data centers in Riyadh and Dammam are likely to launch in the second quarter. Both of them will have an initial capacity of up to 100 megawatts.\nAmin also told Bloomberg News that Humain is presently sourcing semiconductors for its data centers from U.S. chipmakers, including Nvidia.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q2 2025.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n10. Fabrinet (NYSE:FN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 32\nFabrinet (NYSE:FN) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Analysts Say You Shouldn\u2019t Ignore. On August 25, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee upgraded the stock from Neutral to Overweight with a price target of $345.00 (from $318.00).\nThe firm has upgraded the stock citing robust \u201clonger-term drivers for optical companies with leverage to multi-faceted investment.\u201d Analysts are also optimistic that the recent shares pull-back offers a lucrative opportunity for investors to \u201cparticipate in the upside.\u201d\nThe stock experienced a pull-back because of investors hoping for faster growth with customers, but short term supply shortages slowed things down. However, the firm highlighted several catalysts that are working in favor of the stock, such as program ramps with customers such as Nvidia\u2019s 1.6T opportunity, Ciena\u2019s modem opportunity, and Amazon\u2019s HPC opportunity.\n\u201cFollowing the recent pull-back, Fabrinet shares are now trading closer to ~24x NTM consensus earnings, which is significantly lower than the nearly 30x it was trading at prior to the latest earnings report, and the market is now underappreciating the proximity of large concurrent program ramps with prominent customers, including: 1) Nvidia: The 1.6T opportunity is forecasted to represent a $1.5 bn market opportunity in CY26 and could double thereafter; 2) Ciena: The modem opportunity is expected to start generating material revenue in CY26 and we estimate should exceed the historical revenue of Infinera at full run- rate, given its at least 2x greater scale (Infinera revenue recently reached ~$330 mn in FY23); and 3) Amazon: The HPC opportunity represents a sizable total market opportunity of $1.5 bn in our estimate and could be complemented to some degree by the $2 bn+ total transceiver opportunity at the customer starting in the second half of the fiscal year, if not the calendar year. The above customer-specific ramps are set against a backdrop of solid momentum in Telecom, with high-growth DCI revenues already accounting for more than 10% of total revenue and is poised to increase in subsequent years. Unsurprisingly, the multitude of growth drivers are leading a typically prudent management team to consider accelerating construction at Building 10 (adds $2.4 bn of revenue at full capacity vs. current capacity of $4.2 bn), which is another sign that FY27 demand is poised to exceed earlier expectations. Thus, we see Fabrinet well-positioned to deliver material upside to estimates, particularly as large customer programs hit their stride, which will likely encourage investors to revisit the premium valuation multiple they would be willing to ascribe and drive upside to Fabrinet shares trading at ~19x CY27 consensus estimates.\u201d\n9. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 38\nRivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Analysts Say You Shouldn\u2019t Ignore. On August 25, Needham analyst Chris Pierce reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $14.00 price target. The rating affirmation comes ahead of the company\u2019s R2 launch supported by end-market diligence and a consumer survey.\nAccording to the firm, the R2 is Rivian\u2019s mid-size SUV with an approximate $50,000 average selling price. This vehicle has the potential to expand the company\u2019s total addressable market beyond the company\u2019s expensive R1 vehicle.\n\u201cWe reiterate our Buy rating and $14 target ahead of RIVN\u2019s R2 launch, supported by end-market diligence and a consumer survey conducted in low EV penetration metros. The R2 is RIVN\u2019s ~$50k ASP mid-size SUV, substantially expanding RIVN\u2019s TAM beyond the more expensive R1 vehicle. The size of the potential market opportunity for the R2 is encouraging when looking across current EV and ICE offerings at similar price points, and even more so vs modest consensus FY26 R2 delivery estimates. Our survey work found strong RIVN brand awareness, limited negative perception and encouraging purchase intent, positioning RIVN favorably to capture share as the R2 enters the mid-size SUV segment. Our $14 price target represents 15x EV/our FY28E adj EBITDA discounted back.\u201d\nRivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is an automaker that creates and manufactures electric vehicles, as well as software and services.\n8. Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 59\nElastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Analysts Say You Shouldn\u2019t Ignore. On August 25, BofA Securities analyst Koji Ikeda lowered the price target on the stock to $96.00 (from $104.00) while maintaining a Neutral rating. The price target adjustment largely stems from heightened competitive risks, particularly in AI workloads.\nThe firm discussed three points related to Elastic\u2019s results:\n\u201cThree points into results: (1) Elevated scrutiny on the predictability of paid open-source models. (2) Elastic\u2019s participation in the AI theme. (3) FY26 revenue growth guidance. ESTC shares are trading at a 22% discount multiple to infrastructure software peers (i.e., 4.5x CY26E revenue vs. 5.8x peers). However, we believe the risk/reward is balanced, as recent checks suggest competition for AI workloads is increasing. This could weigh on Elastic\u2019s revenue growth. We believe the key metric is subscription revenue excluding monthly customers, where if growth accelerates to 20%+ y/y, from +19.3% last quarter, it could be a catalyst. Reiterate Neutral, lower PO to $96 (from $104) on higher competitive risks. PO now based on 5.3x EV/CY26E revenue (was 5.9x) vs peers at 5.8x.\u201d\nElastic N.V. is a search AI company offering cloud-based solutions.\n7. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 82\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Analysts Say You Shouldn\u2019t Ignore. On August 25, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh reiterated a Sector Weight rating on the stock citing positive implications from the US and Softbank Equity Stake in Intel.\nIntel is issuing 433M new shares of common stock to the US government for 10% equity stake. The firm discussed the funding breakdown, past support, and the \u201cpassive\u201d role of the US government in Intel.\n\u201cOn August 22, 2025, Intel announced that it will issue 433M new shares of common stock to the U.S. government, giving Washington a 10% equity stake in the Company. The $8.9B investment will be funded by $5.7B of CHIPS Act grants previously awarded but not yet disbursed and $3.2B from the Secure Enclave program, with Intel continuing to meet its defense-related obligations. Including the $2.2B in grants already received, the total government support rises to $11.1B. Additionally, the government\u2019s investment in INTC will be a passive ownership, with no Board representation or other governance or information rights. The government also agrees to vote with the Company\u2019s Board of Directors on matters requiring shareholder approval, with limited exceptions. Finally, the existing claw-back and profit-sharing provisions associated with the government\u2019s previously dispersed $2.2 billion grant to Intel under the CHIPS Act will be eliminated to create permanency of capital as the Company advances its U.S. investment plans. We see positive implications associated with this transaction as we were previously concerned that the U.S. government\u2019s equity stake would likely have other INTC obligations with a potentially activist ownership role. Additionally, with the removal of the clawback on the previous CHIPS Act grant and announced equity transaction, uncertainty associated with whether INTC\u2019s Chips Act funding would be reneged is off the table.\u201d\nKeyBanc also highlighted Intel\u2019s investment from SoftBank, stating that the combined transactions of US government and SoftBank will have a modest dilutive impact of $0.07 on their FY26 EPS estimate of $0.67. Despite the positive developments, the firm maintains a Sector Weight rating on the stock.\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs and sells computing hardware, semiconductor products, and AI-driven solutions for various industries.\n6. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 94\nMicron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Analysts Say You Shouldn\u2019t Ignore. On August 25, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse reiterated an Overweight rating on the stock with a $155.00 price target.\nEven though Samsung has successfully qualified for HBM products, the firm remains optimistic on Micron as it believes Samsung\u2019s gains will likely come at the expense of Hynix rather than Micron.\nIt also believes that Samsung will face obstructions in overcoming major technological challenges. Meanwhile, HBM roadmap is bound to get more difficult as stacks get higher and customized logic base dies come into play in the HBM4E timeframe. Micron\u2019s own performance/watt advantage and stable supply will further allow it to sustain its competitive position.\n\u201cwhile a successful Samsung qualification will likely impact Micron\u2019s market share position, we continue to believe that Samsung\u2019s gains will largely come at the expense of Hynix. With regards to tailwinds, we see large hurdles in Samsung\u2019s ability to overcome technological challenges including acceptable and thermal/power issues as well as poor yields derived from issues with dicing, sawing and laser ablation as well as delamination and cracking. Additionally, the HBM roadmap will only get more difficult as stacks get higher and customized logic base dies come into play in the HBM4E timeframe. This, coupled with Micron\u2019s performance/watt advantage and stable supply should augur well for sustained demand for Micron\u2019s HBM products.\u201d\nMicron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) develops and sells memory and storage products for data centers, mobile devices, and various industries worldwide.\n5. Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 100\nSnowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Analysts Say You Shouldn\u2019t Ignore. On August 25, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $250.00 price target ahead of the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings on August 27th.\nThe firm regards Snowflake as one of its top picks in infrastructure software, particularly highlighting its core data warehouse Snowpark and AI/ML products.\n\u201cAhead of Snowflake\u2019s 2Q26 earnings this upcoming Wednesday, August 27, we are providing updated thoughts on what we continue to put as one of our top picks in infrastructure software. We\u2019re seeing durable momentum across the core data warehouse, Snowpark, data engineering and AI/ML products, backed by what we\u2019re hearing from our conversation with The DEN and our proprietary DaVinci Developer Dataset, which is seeing record developer activity across Snowflake. Given what we view as still one of the best stories in all of Software, we reiterate our BUY rating and $250 price target.\u201d\nSnowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) is a cloud-based data storage company providing a data analysis, storage, and sharing platform.\n4. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 156\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Analysts Say You Shouldn\u2019t Ignore. On August 25, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised the price target on the stock to $345.00 (from $290.00) while maintaining a Buy rating. The rating affirmation reflects the firm\u2019s optimism regarding Broadcom\u2019s artificial intelligence momentum as it heads into fiscal third-quarter earnings.\nSet to report on September 4th, Wall Street analysts anticipate the semiconductor and software giant to report earnings of $1.66 in Q3, compared to $1.24 in the same quarter last year. Its revenue for Q3 is also expected to rise 21% year-over-year to $15.82 billion.\nArcuri has particularly noted in-line results for AVGO but expects the company to raise guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. Google\u2019s newest AI chip, the TPUv6p, which rely on Broadcom\u2019s custom silicon, are ramping up and notably the cause for the expected raised guidance.\nIt is also anticipated that TPUv6p will witness a sharp acceleration in the second half of 2025, extending into 2026. Wafer requirements for these chips are also likely to increase by 51% year-over-year, with overall momentum translating to a 60% year-over-year increase in the company\u2019s AI revenue for 2025.\nMeanwhile, AI-related networking will potentially ramp-up in fiscal 2026 as Ethernet architecture deployment increases. Arcuri also believes that Broadcom will reaffirm a $60 to $90 billion serviceable addressable market for custom chips.\nBroadcom is a technology company uniquely positioned in the AI revolution owing to its custom chip offerings and networking assets.\n3. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 156\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Analysts Say You Shouldn\u2019t Ignore. On August 22, Evercore ISI reiterated the stock as \u201cOutperform\u201d stating that it likes Apple\u2019s price hikes on Apple TV+.\n\u201cWe think the Apple TV+ price increases could help modestly on services growth, but the real intent is to minimize churn. Services remain on track for double digit growth (provided Licensing relationship stays intact). Maintain OP and $250 price target.\u201d\nApple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.\n2. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Analysts Say You Shouldn\u2019t Ignore. On August 25, Citizens JMP analyst Andrew Boone reiterated a Market Outperform rating on the stock with a $225.00 price target. The firm talked about a recent update to Google\u2019s most powerful AI search experience, the AI mode.\n\u201cWith this update, AI Mode is now offering personalized responses based on conversation history and past searches to offer more relevant results. Combining Google\u2019s existing data may enable Google to offer more relevant responses while personalized history may create switching costs for chat bots over time as we continue to look for moats in AI beyond brand preference and distribution.\u201d\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is an American multinational technology conglomerate holding company wholly owning the internet giant Google, amongst other businesses.\n1. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 235\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Analysts Say You Shouldn\u2019t Ignore. On August 25, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse reiterated an Overweight rating on the stock with a $240.00 price target driven by strength in artificial intelligence infrastructure spend.\nIndeed, artificial intelligence infrastructure spend continues to accelerate on the back of hyperscalers, sovereigns, neoclouds, and enterprises. Hyperscalers alone have had their capital expenditure forecasts risen to 57% and 20% for calendar years 2025 and 2026, across big tech names such as Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon.\nThe firm has also highlighted several challenges, but noted that these are only temporary. Overall, Nvidia remains Cantor\u2019s top idea especially with the company being in the early stages of its Blackwell product cycle, positioning it for major beats and raises.\n\u201cYes, we have seen some degrossing with momentum names losing luster within the current backdrop (temporary digestion in our view) and recent reports of challenges regarding integration of AI capabilities into business models (we believe a dynamic which is overdone \u2013 no concern from us with hyperscaler ROIC still strong). We also have some reports out of China regarding willingness to adopt US accelerator solutions causing some agita in the AI trade (specifically today centered around the H20). But we view these trepidations as noise today and there is zero change to our bullish thesis here as we remain in the infancy of AI development and deployment. And we look for spending commentary across verticals and strong product cycle dynamics to continue driving the AI trade (yes, it\u2019s that simple; buy the arms dealers). Our top idea here remains NVDA (see our full EPS preview here), as we remain in the early innings of the Blackwell ramp which we believe sets up for meaningful beats/raises and EPS tracking to stretch goal of $8 in CY26 (supporting our PT of $240 at a 30x multiple).\u201d\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA and that has 100x upside potential, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 10 AI Stocks in the Spotlight Today and 10 Must-Watch AI Stocks for Investors.\nDisclosure: None.

It may sound like we are in a normal year, but we are not. The first half of the year included a sharp sell-off in the Information Technology sector due to AI competition from China, as well as near trip into a bear market as investors hit the sell button as tariff talk began. But tariff talk turned out to be largely just that (more talk than actual tariffs, at least thus far) and investors have refocused on the positive fundamentals of a growing economy, expanding earnings, and declining interest rates. Drilling down to sectors, breadth has improved in 2025, with groups like Industrials, Utilities, Consumer Staples, Financial, and Energy all performing in line with or better than the market averages. During 2Q, the average stock in the Argus Universe of Coverage increased 4.2%. Below are the Top-10 performers from the Argus Universe in2Q, with representatives from four of the 11 major sectors, as well as the Bottom-Five performers.\nThe Argus Dividend Growth Model Portfolio\nDividend income is often overlooked amid gyrations in the stock market. Consider that in 2024, market bulls were boasting about 24%-plus S&P 500 returns. No one was very focused on the broad market index's 1.2% dividend yield. But dividends are an important element of return, and 2025 is bearing that out. Through May, the S&P 500 was up a thin 1.1%; without dividends, there was essentially no returns at all. Indeed, dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. Not for nothing, in 2022, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices turned bearish as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates. We saw that pattern in 2018 as well. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main investment categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks.\nTop Analysts: AVGO\nView MoreOverall Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest for AVGO overall weighted by direction, price target, and price movement.\nLearn MoreDirection Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the directional movement of AVGO.\nLearn MorePrice Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the price target of AVGO.\nLearn More"

      "text": "The race toward artificial intelligence supremacy is intensifying, and it seems that independency is emerging as a key focal point. In the latest news, The Financial Times has reported that China chipmakers are fast-tracking their initiatives to triple the country\u2019s output of artificial intelligence chips in 2026.\nThe main goal, as claimed by the report, is to reduce the country\u2019s dependency on US chips. If China succeeds in this effort, it will be able to successfully counter the looming threat of US export controls, as well as alleviate national security concerns.\nAccording to the report, Huawei is planning to begin production at a plant that will specifically make AI chips by year end. Moreover, there are two more facilities set to launch in 2026.\nThe report has highlighted that the combined output from the three potential plants may surpass the current production capacity at China\u2019s chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC).\nSMIC itself plans to double manufacturing capacity for 7 nanometre chips next year. According to the report, Huawei is its largest customer.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q2 2025.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n10. Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 59\nElastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Hit with New Analyst Ratings. On August 26, TD Cowen analyst Andrew Sherman lowered the price target on the stock to $85.00 (from $90.00) while maintaining a Hold rating. The lower price target comes ahead of the company\u2019s print due on August 28.\nThe firm has updated its model ahead of its quarterly results, anticipating a beat and raise. Moreover, given the new CFO, the company will likely guide conservatively.\n\u201cExpecting Modest Beat & Raise; ESTC reports on 8/28. We expect a beat & raise given new CFO likely guided conservatively. Our partner checks remain mixed, citing fine renewals but competitive factors & AI risks. Our partner survey down-ticked w/ 67% met/beat vs. 86% last qtr, though pipelines looked better. At 4.3x EV/Sales we see low expectations but a return to Cloud upside is needed.\nShares are -14% since reporting 4Q (IGV +5%). Sentiment seems relatively bearish & valuations at ~4.3x EV/CY26E Sales & ~20x EV/FCF shares trade at a discount to 10-15% comps at ~5x. Reiterate Hold & lower PT to $85 (~4.5x EV/CY26E Sales).\u201d\nElastic N.V. is a search AI company offering cloud-based solutions.\n9. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 82\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Hit with New Analyst Ratings. On August 25, TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a $20.00 price target following the announcement that the US government is taking a stake in the chipmaker.\nAccording to the firm, the finalized agreement with the Trump administration on previously signed CHIPS Act and Secure Enclave funding is seen to be positive. This is because the company seems to be in a favorable political position now.\nHowever, the firm pointed out that Intel isn\u2019t receiving any meaningful net new capital, and that the company\u2019s issues are technical and competitive. These issues aren\u2019t such that funding alone can resolve them.\nIt also believes it is difficult to be confident about Intel\u2019s future both in the short and long-term. The challenges weighing in on the company are going to take their due time to resolve, and solid proof such as earnings or cash flow will take time to show up.\n\u201cNet, it remains difficult for us to gain confidence in the immediate and long-term path forward. Roadmaps and customer confidence are not (re)built overnight, and the strategy seems very much in flux. That said, Intel\u2019s market breadth and extensive intellectual property assets across compute, combined with now more closely aligned incentives with the White House, cannot be fully counted out yet, and there are likely ways to monetize its collection of assets for shareholders. We think the near-term and long-term overhangs on the narrative will likely be an overhang until more tangible metrics (e.g., earnings, FCF) begin to inflect to support valuation\u2026which we think remains a long ways away.\u201d\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs and sells computing hardware, semiconductor products, and AI-driven solutions for various industries."
