      "summary": "Senator Josh Hawley has demanded that Meta hand over documents related to its AI chatbot policies that allegedly allowed romantic and sensual exchanges with minors, prompting a congressional investigation and Meta's claim that the examples were erroneous. Hawley’s campaign has also faced a cease‑and‑desist from Politico over the sale of a Jan. 6 photo of him raising a fist, which Hawley defends as fair use. The article recounts Hawley’s controversial role in the Capitol riot, his criticism from former allies, and his lone Republican vote against the COVID‑19 Hate Crimes Act, which President Biden signed to address rising anti‑Asian violence. The piece concludes with a brief overview of the Act’s provisions and bipartisan support for combating hate crimes amid the pandemic.",
