  "title": "Panasonic and LG's flagship OLED TVs use the same panel, but that doesn't mean you get the same picture: here's what happened when I put them side-by-side",
  "description": "The same panel, different results",
  "content": "LG and Panasonic are just two of the top brands in the OLED TV market, but unlike rivals such as Samsung, Sony and Philips, their TVs often share a lot in common, right down to using the same OLED display panels.\n\nThe LG G4 and Panasonic Z95A, two of the best OLED TVs launched in 2024, both used micro-lens-array (MLA) OLED panels manufactured by LG. In 2025, it\u2019s a similar story as the LG G5 and Panasonic Z95B both use LG\u2019s new Primary Tandem RGB OLED panel (also known as four-stack OLED).\n\nThat means you should expect a similar picture from both, right?\n\nAs I\u2019ve discovered when testing combinations of some of the best TVs, models that use the same display panel don\u2019t always look the same. For example, the Samsung S95F and Sony Bravia 8 II flagship OLED TVs use Samsung\u2019s QD-OLED panels, but when I tested them side by side, I got very different results.\n\nThe LG G5 and Panasonic Z95B were featured in our recent OLED four-way showdown with a casual judging panel, with the aforementioned S95F and Bravia 8 II rounding out the group, but I thought it would be illuminating to compare the LG and Panasonic on their own.\n\nWith both the Z95B and G5's default Filmmaker Mode settings active, it was clear that the G5 had a huge brightness advantage \u2013 an odd result considering both use the same OLED panel. When viewing some demo footage from the Spears & Munsil UHD Benchmark 4K Blu-ray in HDR10 format, scenes with snow looked far brighter and more vibrant on the G5, with much more brilliant whites and highlights. The Z95B\u2019s picture still looked very accurate, but dim in comparison.\n\nLeaving both sets in Filmmaker Mode, I measured the Z95B\u2019s peak HDR brightness on a 10% white window pattern at 1,028 nits, a significantly lower result than the G5\u2019s 2,268 nits on the same pattern.\n\nAfter a quick check of the Z95B\u2019s picture settings, I found its Luminance Level (brightness) was set to 70/100 by default, while the G5\u2019s was set to 100/100. After upping the Z95B\u2019s brightness to 100, it hit 2,355 nits, making it the brightest OLED I\u2019d measured to date on this test.\n\nGoing back to the same Spears & Munsil footage with the brightness on the Z95B set to 100, the snow scenes now showed much more dazzling whites. It looked very similar to the G5, with the only real difference being the color temperature. I did, however, feel that despite the boost in brightness, the Z95B lost a little of the picture accuracy I\u2019d noted previously.\n\nBoth the Z95B and G5 had superb color in my comparison. Watching more Spears & Munsil footage in HDR10 format, a parrot\u2019s yellow and green feathers looked vivid on both TVs, and a field of red flowers was crisp and refined, with plenty of punch. Once again, the G5\u2019s brightness in default settings gave colors more pop, but upping the Z95B\u2019s brightness brought it to a similar level of vibrancy. The Z95B demonstrated richer, deeper colors, though, thanks to its stronger contrast and more refined black levels.\n\nSwitching to Wicked on 4K Blu-ray in Dolby Vision, the default brightness settings were 100/100 in both the Dolby Vision Dark mode on the Z95B and Dolby Vision Filmmaker Mode on the G5. This made the colors on both TVs look very similar. Elphaba\u2019s green skin and the pink flowers and blue details on a wall in the Wizard & I scene both had the same eye-popping, vibrant color, and they also looked true-to-life.\n\nWhere the TVs differed was that the Z95B's deeper black levels made colors appear bolder and more detailed, whereas they looked brighter and punchier on the G5. This was easy to see in Glinda\u2019s pink outfits and the greens of the Emerald City in Wicked.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect from two top-tier OLED TVs, both black levels and contrast are excellent. Watching Alien: Romulus in Dolby Vision on 4K Blu-ray, shots of space or dark tunnels within the ship showcased rich black levels on both TVs, with excellent contrast between dark shadows and bright highlights from stars, lights and torches. The Z95B had the edge of the two TVs here with its deeper blacks, but again, both looked great.\n\nSwitching to The Batman in Dolby Vision on 4K Blu-ray, I used the opening crime scene section I regularly use for testing contrast. For this movie, I had to view in dimmed or pitch black conditions as both the Z95B and G5 struggled with the overhead lighting in our testing lab.\n\nInterestingly, although both showcased excellent black levels and contrast, with the torches carried by detectives balancing well against the dim surroundings, I noticed that in pitch black conditions, black levels were more elevated on the G5. The Z95B\u2019s deeper blacks resulted in stronger contrast, although there was some loss of shadow detail, specifically Batman\u2019s eye and the logo on his chest when he looked towards the camera. Of the two, I found myself drawn to the Z95B as it felt more accurate to the movie.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that in recent years, a drawback of Panasonic\u2019s flagship OLED TVs has been their price, which is often hundreds more than that of its main rivals at launch. This year, however, Panasonic is being more aggressive with its pricing. The 55-inch Z95B is available for $2,399 / \u00a32,299, while the 55-inch G5 is available for $2,199 / \u00a32,299. The 65-inch Z95B, meanwhile, is available for $3,099 / \u00a32799, while the 65-inch G5 is $2,899 / \u00a32.899.\n\nOne thing that could swing things in the Z95B\u2019s favor between these two TVs is sound. Panasonic\u2019s TVs are always among the best TVs for sound, and the Z95B is no different.\n\nWatching the Batmobile chase scene from The Batman, the Z95B stood head and shoulders above the G5 when it came to the built-in sound. The Z95B\u2019s punchier sound and much more powerful bass better captured the rumble of the Batmobile\u2019s engine and the crunching of car impacts and explosions. Speech was clear on both sets, but the Z95B delivered better clarity. With the Z95B, you can easily watch without using one of the best soundbars \u2013 a factor that saves you money \u2013 whereas a soundbar is more recommended with the G5.\n\nWhere the G5 has the edge is in its gaming features, which are up there with the best gaming TVs and include 4K 165Hz support on four HDMI 2.1 ports. The LG\u2019s webOS 25 smart TV interface is also one of the best I\u2019ve used and provides a superior overall experience to the Z95B\u2019s Fire TV smart interface.\n\nBoth of these are class-leading OLED TVs, and both are in the conversation for TV of the year. But based on this comparison, I found myself favoring the Panasonic Z95B. Its default Filmmaker Mode brightness setting may be odd, but once adjusted, I found myself more drawn to its picture than the LG G5's picture.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 I tested LG, Samsung and Sony's elite 2025 OLED TVs side-by-side \u2013 here's the one I'd buy with my own money\n\u2022 I tested the Samsung S95F and LG G5 OLED TVs side-by-side: here's which one you should get\n\u2022 I tested Samsung and LG's cheapest OLED TVs side-by-side to see which TV comes out on top \u2013 here's what happened",

      "text": "I tested LG, Samsung and Sony's elite 2025 OLED TVs side-by-side \u2013 here's the one I'd buy with my own money\nWhich elite OLED TV is best?\nLG, Samsung and Sony have dominated the OLED TV market for years, with LG and Samsung offering the best overall bang for your buck and Sony delivering a premium picture and superior sound, but at an inflated price.\nCut to 2025, and the battle for the title of best OLED TV has never been more competitive. We\u2019ve reviewed the flagship OLED TV for each brand, the LG G5, Samsung S95F and Sony Bravia 8 II, and the results were overwhelmingly positive. Both the G5 and S95F earned five out of five stars in their reviews, and the Bravia 8 II earned four-and-a-half out of five stars in its review.\nI\u2019ve already compared the Sony and Samsung QD-OLED TVs side-by-side and the LG and Samsung TVs side-by-side, but recently got to put all three next to one another, with each one displaying the same content, so I could determine which TV I would pick if I had the money to buy one.\nA quick note regarding photos: the Sony Bravia 8 II and especially the Samsung S95F may appear to have a red tint across the screen. This is a result of their anti-reflection screen tech, as it reacts with cameras. In real life, this doesn't look as pronounced.\nScreen reflections\nOne of the things I appreciated about the S95F\u2019s predecessor, the Samsung S95D, was its OLED Glare Free screen, which eliminated mirror-like reflections. Black levels, however, weren't as rich as I\u2019d hoped. The S95F with its OLED Glare Free 2.0 screen mostly solves that problem by still eliminating reflections while also maintaining rich black levels.\nThe S95F\u2019s screen means darker movies such as The Batman, Nosferatu and Alien: Romulus look good even in brighter viewing conditions. I knew going into this comparison that the LG G5 and Sony Bravia 8 II wouldn\u2019t fare as well as the S95F in bright room lighting conditions, but I was surprised by the results.\nOf the three TVs, the LG G5 with its traditional glossy screen was the worst for reflections. The Bravia 8 II\u2019s anti-reflection screen, in contrast, did a surprisingly good job at limiting reflections.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAbove are three images of the TVs in our testing lab with overhead lights turned on. The S95F is the clear winner, with the Bravia 8 II second and the G5 third, in terms of reflection handling.\nBrightness\nOne thing that was immediately obvious in my comparison is that the Bravia 8 II doesn\u2019t have the same brightness as the G5 or S95F, and in fact looks dim in comparison. When we measured HDR peak brightness on the LG G5 and Samsung S95F in Filmmaker Mode, they hit 2,268 nits and 2,132 nits, respectively. The Bravia 8 II, on the other hand, measured a substantially lower 1,439 nits HDR peak brightness in its Cinema mode.\nFullscreen brightness was a similar story. The G5 hit 331 nits and the S95F 390 nits, both in Filmmaker Mode. The Bravia 8 II, on the other hand, only managed 183 nits in its Cinema mode, which seems low for a QD-OLED model. That result is actually lower than the mid-range LG C5 OLED, which hit 199 nits on the same test!\nThis was with the TVs in their default out-of-the-box settings. The Bravia 8 II has a picture setting called Dynamic Tone Mapping, with two options: Gradation Preferred and Brightness Preferred. If you change from the default Gradation to Brightness, the Bravia 8 II gets a nice brightness boost, as you can see in the same image from The Batman above, where Batman\u2019s face suddenly appears much clearer in the second image, compared to the first image. Using the Brightness Preferred setting, black levels and contrast suffer a little, however, so it\u2019ll come down to your personal taste.\nColors, black levels and contrast\nFiring up a 4K Blu-ray of Wicked, it was clear that all three TVs demonstrated excellent color reproduction. The pink flowers, Elphaba\u2019s green skin, and blue details on the beige walls all looked vivid on each TV, though it was clear that the Bravia 8 II\u2019s lower brightness took away some of the shine.\nIt was a tough call between the G5 and S95F. While the S95F exhibited more dynamic colors thanks to its higher peak brightness, with all TVs set to Movie/Cinema mode, the G5\u2019s stronger contrast and deeper black levels helped generate better color depth. In the end, I found my eye drawn to the G5 the most.\nFor HDR color gamut coverage, all three TVs hit over 99% of the DCI-P3 color space, so it\u2019s no wonder all three had spectacular color reproduction.\nFor black levels, there was once again a clear winner: the LG G5. Watching The Batman, particularly the opening subway fight scene and crime scene in the mayor\u2019s home, black levels were strong on all three TVs, but the G5\u2019s were the richest and deepest. Next to the G5, the Bravia 8 II and especially the S95F\u2019s black levels looked raised by comparison, although still deeper than what you\u2019ll find on the best mini-LED TVs.\nContrast was exceptional on all three TVs. Watching 4K discs with especially dark scenes such as The Batman, Nosferatu, and Alien: Romulus, all three sets showcased an excellent balance between light and dark tones. But once again, the G5 and the S95F\u2019s higher brightness resulted in a more impactful picture with stronger contrast compared to the Bravia 8 II.\nSony\u2019s sound\nReading this, it may seem like I\u2019m underwhelmed by the Sony Bravia 8 II compared to the other TVs. But while the Bravia 8 II doesn\u2019t have the same overall visual impact as the G5 and S95F, it\u2019s still a fantastic TV, and it beats the other two in some key areas.\nWhen watching black and white scenes, such as those in Oppenheimer, the S95F and G5\u2019s higher brightness led to a picture with stronger contrast, but I found the Bravia 8 II\u2019s cooler color balance suited black and white scenes better.\nThe Bravia 8 II also has superior built-in sound. Sony\u2019s TVs often rank among the best TVs for sound, and the Bravia 8 II is no different. Using the Batmobile/Penguin chase scene from The Batman, the Bravia 8 II demonstrated the punchiest bass, clearest speech and most accurate mapping of sound effects, such as screeching tyres and spraying bullets.\nWhile the S95F delivered impactful bass and clear speech, its soundstage felt narrow compared to the Bravia 8 II, with the sound more contained to the screen. The G5\u2019s bass wasn\u2019t as hefty as the other TVs, but it did deliver a wider soundstage than the S95F. Neither could match up to the Bravia 8 II\u2019s sheer power and accuracy, however.\nFinal thoughts\nAll three of these TVs can be ranked among the best TVs of 2025. They deliver a list of gaming features up there with the best gaming TVs, and have exceptional picture quality and solid built-in sound. Each has its strengths \u2013 black levels and picture accuracy on the G5, brightness and Glare Free tech on the S95F, and powerful built-in sound on the Bravia 8 II \u2013 but the one TV I would spend my own money on is the LG G5.\nYou might also like\nJames is the TV Hardware Staff Writer at TechRadar.

      "text": "I tested Samsung and Sony\u2019s 2025 QD-OLED TVs side-by-side, and it\u2019s a battle for the ages\nQD-OLED is a recent addition to the world of display technologies. Combining an OLED display panel with a quantum dot layer, QD-OLED was first introduced in 2022 with the Samsung S95B OLED TV.\nWhile the S95B was an impressive TV, QD-OLED really hit its stride in 2024 with the Samsung S95D, which offered a brighter, more vibrant alternative to standard W-OLED TVs.\nQD-OLED is not only used by some of the best TVs from Samsung, but has also been adopted by Sony, adding a brightness boost to TVs like the Sony A95L in 2023 and now the Sony Bravia 8 II in 2025.\nI recently had the chance to review the Samsung S95F, a TV that I awarded five out of five stars for its exceptional picture quality and gaming performance, but also for its effective Glare Free screen.\nLike the Samsung S95F, the Sony Bravia 8 II also uses an anti-reflective screen to lessen the impact of room lighting on pictures. TechRadar\u2019s Sony Bravia 8 II review is still in the works, but I recently had a chance to test it side-by-side with the Samsung S95F to see how these two flagship QD-OLED TVs compare.\nReflections, be gone\nThe Samsung S95F\u2019s seriously impressive Glare Free 2.0 screen all but eliminates mirror-like reflections, reducing glare from light sources to a barely visible haze, while simultaneously maintaining deep black levels, something its Samsung S95D predecessor struggled with.\nThe S95F\u2019s reflection-eliminating capabilities are aided by its high screen brightness. I measured its peak brightness at 2,132 nits in Filmmaker Mode. It also has impressive fullscreen brightness, hitting 390 nits in Filmmaker Mode, the highest fullscreen brightness level we\u2019ve measured so far on an OLED TV.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nI anticipated that the Sony Bravia 8 II wouldn\u2019t fare as well at beating reflections, as it doesn't feature the same matte screen as the S95F, instead opting for a glossy screen with an anti-reflection coating. But I was pleasantly surprised by how well it fared in my comparison.\nWith both TVs turned off in our lab in bright lighting conditions, objects were reflected on the Bravia 8 II\u2019s screen, but they were not as obvious as when I previously compared screen reflections on the Samsung S95F and the LG G5, another flagship OLED TV.\nWhen watching dark movies such as The Batman (a particularly challenging source for testing due to its low mastered brightness), mirror-like reflections were more obvious on the Bravia 8 II compared to the S95F, and it was best viewed in dimmed lighting conditions. But again, it fared better than the LG G5 did on a similar comparison in the same bright viewing conditions in our testing lab, and the Bravia 8 II also did a better job of maintaining shadow detail than the G5.\nThe Batman looked clearer in bright room lighting on the S95F thanks to its anti-glare screen, especially viewed in the brighter Movie mode. Black levels looked slightly raised compared to the Bravia 8 II, but they were still rich and inky.\nPicture quality battle\nWhen I measured the Samsung S95F\u2019s HDR color gamut, it was the first TV I\u2019d yet tested to hit 100% coverage, and it also hit an impressively high 89.3% BT.2020 color gamut coverage.\nIn our measurements of the Sony Bravia 8 II, it hit an equally impressive 99.9% for UHDA-P3 and 87.5% for BT.2020.\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that when I dimmed the lights and watched the Wizard & I scene from Wicked where Elphaba stands under pink flowers and a wall with blue details, both TVs showcased spectacular colors that were vibrant and punchy. A later scene in the Emerald City also showcased luscious, glossy greens on both screens, especially with the Samsung\u2019s brighter Movie mode and the Sony\u2019s Cinema mode active.\nThe S95F\u2019s higher peak brightness made highlights look punchier than on the Bravia 8 II, however. In a shot where Elphaba runs through a cornfield, the yellows of the corn and the sun looked more vivid on the S95F compared to the Bravia 8 II.\nAn area where the Bravia 8 II had an upper edge was in the naturalness of its picture. Textures and details looked realistic on both TVs, but the Bravia 8 II\u2019s picture had a more true-to-life look. A close-up in Wicked of Elphaba\u2019s hand as a dragonfly lands on it showed more detail in her fingers on the Bravia 8 II, for example.\nBoth TVs displayed excellent contrast. In both the subway and crime scene investigation sequences near the start of The Batman, each showed a strong balance between light and dark tones, with lights and torches easily cutting through the dark surroundings.\nViewing black and white scenes from Oppenheimer, both again demonstrated strong contrast and a wide range of gray tones. I found myself more drawn to the Bravia 8 II\u2019s picture, however, as white highlights on the S95F overpowered the rest of the picture. Switching to Filmmaker Mode for the S95F and Professional for the Bravia 8 II, it was a more closely fought contest, but again, I still leaned towards the Bravia 8 II.\nSuperior Sony sound\nSony has delivered some of the best TVs for sound over the past few years, and the Bravia 8 II\u2019s Acoustic Surface Audio tech actually positions actuators behind the screen that turn the entire TV into a speaker.\nThe S95F doesn\u2019t have the best sound quality on the market, but it certainly matches or beats some other examples of the best OLED TVs, such as the LG C5. Compared with the Sony Bravia 8 II, however, it\u2019s a different story.\nWatching the Batmobile chase from The Batman, both the S95F and Bravia 8 II produced punchy but controlled bass, but the Bravia 8 II\u2019s was more impactful, accurately capturing the rumble of the Batmobile\u2019s engine.\nWatching the Penguin and Batman weave through traffic, both sets demonstrated accurate placement of sound, but the Bravia 8 II produced a wider soundstage that gave it a more immersive feel. Dolby Atmos height effects, such as the pounding rain, were also more audible on the Bravia 8 II.\nVoices were crystal clear on both TVs throughout Wicked, but the Bravia 8 II\u2019s wider soundstage gave vocals a greater sense of space in musical numbers. Even sound effects such as shuffling and scraping feet, and the wind during the broom scene in Defying Gravity, were more pronounced on the Bravia 8 II.\nFinal thoughts\nBoth the Samsung S95F and Sony Bravia 8 II are set to be two of the best OLED TVs of 2025. The S95F is undoubtedly a better fit for brighter rooms, and its higher brightness also gives more colorful pictures a better punch. But the Bravia 8 II\u2019s accurate picture and its superior sound system can\u2019t be ignored.\nOn paper, the S95F is the more complete package, with a wider range of gaming features and a slimmer design. But with the Bravia 8 II launching at a more aggressive price than usual (roughly $200 / \u00a3200 more expensive in a 55-inch screen when it\u2019s been higher in previous years), the battle between these two QD-OLEDs for your money is going to be interesting.\nYou might also like\n- I've used Samsung TVs for years, and this one important feature is now the best it's ever been\n- I tested Samsung\u2019s next-gen OLED TV matte screen with our 3 darkest 4K Blu-ray movies - here's what I found\n- I went deep with the LG G5 OLED TV, and these 5 viewing experiences show how awesome its picture is\nJames is the TV Hardware Staff Writer at TechRadar.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nLG\u2019s flagship G5 OLED TV makes a dramatic picture brightness leap over last year\u2019s G4, and also offers a range of enhancements and new features with no year-over-year boost in price. The brightness increase is supplied by a new-gen OLED display panel, and it makes the G5 a highly flexible TV that can be used in a range of viewing environments, including brightly lit rooms. A new webOS 25 smart interface provides family-friendly, AI-enhanced customization, and gaming performance is boosted with 4K 165Hz support. The LG G5 is undoubtedly a pricey TV, but it\u2019s also one that offers a fantastic combination of features and performance for the money.\nPros\n- +\nExceptional brightness\n- +\nImproved anti-reflection screen\n- +\nUseful AI-based enhancements and features\nCons\n- -\nPricey compared to mid-range LG C5\n- -\nNo HDR10+ support\n- -\nNew remote lacks input select button\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nLG G5: Two-minute review\nThe LG G5 is the company\u2019s flagship TV for 2025, and it changes the game for OLED TV tech with a completely new panel design that delivers notably higher brightness than its LG G4 predecessor. I\u2019ll get into the specifics of that in the Picture Quality section of this review, but what you need to know is that with its impressive, mini-LED TV-rivalling brightness, the G5 succeeds brilliantly in bringing the best OLED TVs out of the darkness as a viable option for daytime, bright room viewing.\nLG\u2019s G4 relied on a micro lens array (MLA) layer to boost brightness over what conventional OLED TVs were capable of, but the new LG G5 incorporates a new Primary RGB Tandem structure OLED display panel. This uses individual red, green, and blue layers to produce light, and the resulting brightness is not only leaps and bounds better than what the G4 achieved with MLA, but it also yields improvements in color reproduction.\nYou\u2019d think that the G5\u2019s revamped display panel would command a higher price, but the LG pricing is equivalent to its G4 predecessor. However, at $3,399 / \u00a32,399 / AU$5,299 for the 65-inch model I tested, it\u2019s still very much a premium TV.\nAlong with higher brightness and richer color, the LG G5 offers a range of features that make it a flexible option for viewing in a range of lighting conditions. These include a new, more effective anti-glare screen, and a Filmmaker Ambient Light Mode that uses the TV\u2019s built-in light sensor to dynamically adjust brightness without sacrificing picture accuracy in the process.\nLG\u2019s Alpha 11 AI processor Gen 2 is responsible for a range of AI picture and sound enhancements on the G5. These include AI Picture and Sound modes, voice recognition, and personalized content recommendations.\nLG\u2019s webOS 25 smart TV interface has been tweaked with the ability to switch between customized home screen layouts that get triggered by the viewer\u2019s voice, and there are now onscreen wizards to guide you through the process of setting up unique AI picture and sound presets to accompany your custom home screen.\nLG\u2019s flagship G-series OLEDs are designed for wall-mounting, and the G5 has an Always Ready mode that lets the TV be used as a frame for displaying photos and art (now including images generated by AI with the TV\u2019s assistance). But it's also a highly capable gaming TV, with support for 4K 165Hz, Nvidia G-Sync, and AMD FreeSync Premium. The G5\u2019s Quick Card gaming portal also provides over 500 titles plus Nvidia GeForce Now, Luna, and other apps, and Xbox Game Pass support should be added during the start of 2025.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWhile the LG G5 has turned out to be a best-in-class OLED TV option for 2025, many people will be equally pleased with its step-down LG C5 model, which is already looking to be one of 2025's best TVs. The C5 isn't as bright as the G5, but you\u2019ll save quite a bit by going with LG\u2019s mid-range OLED .\nLG G5 review: Price and release date\n- Release date: April 2025\n- 48-inch: \u00a31,799\n- 55-inch: $2,499 / \u00a32,399 / AU$4,199\n- 65-inch: $3,399 / \u00a33,299 / AU$5,299\n- 77-inch: $4,499 / \u00a34,499 / AU$7,999\n- 83-inch: $6,499 / \u00a36,999 / AU$9,999\n- 97-inch: $24,999\nThe LG G5 is widely available in 55- to 83-inch screen sizes. A 48-inch model is also available in the UK, and a 97-inch option in the US, though those models don\u2019t use the same Primary RGB Tandem structure panel as the other sizes, and won't be as bright.\nPrices for the G5 series are equivalent to last year\u2019s LG G4 series, despite the inclusion of a new panel design, but are notably higher than the mid-range LG C5 series OLED TVs.\nLG G5 review: Specs\nScreen type: | OLED |\nRefresh rate: | Up to 165Hz |\nHDR support: | Dolby Vision, HDR10, HLG |\nAudio support: | Dolby Atmos |\nSmart TV: | webOS 25 |\nHDMI ports: | 4 x HDMI 2.1 |\nBuilt-in tuner: | ATSC 1.0 (USA) |\nLG G5 review: Benchmark results\nLG G5 review: Features\n- Fourth-generation panel with Brightness Booster Ultimate\n- Filmmaker Ambient Light Mode debuts here\n- 4K 165Hz gaming support on PC\nA key feature of the LG G5 is a new fourth-generation OLED display panel with Primary RGB Tandem structure. In contrast to previous designs, which used two blue OLED layers plus a third layer with red, green, and yellow elements, the new panel uses individual red, green, and blue layers to produce light.\nThis \u201cfour-stack\u201d structure benefits from increased brightness and enhanced color purity due to the panel\u2019s use of separate OLED layers for the primary colors. Unlike the previous LG G4, the G5 doesn\u2019t rely on a micro lens array (MLA) layer with microscopic lens elements to boost brightness.\nLG refers to its new display panel tech as Brightness Booster Ultimate, and it\u2019s accompanied by several other features to boost picture quality in a range of room lighting conditions. The first is an anti-reflective layer that LG says provides 30% higher glare resistance than last year\u2019s G4.\nAnother is Filmmaker Ambient Light Mode, which uses the TV\u2019s built-in light sensor to map gamma and PQ (the HDR equivalent of gamma) based on room lighting conditions. The G5 also has Perfect Black certification, which confirms that a TV can display less than 0.24 nits in conditions of up to 500 lux.\nThe G5\u2019s Alpha 11 AI processor Gen 2 enables a range of AI-based picture and sound enhancements, including AI Picture and AI Sound modes. Picture and sound wizards guide you through setting up customized presets based on your response to a series of images and sound samples, and once completed, these can be automatically switched on for the specific users who created them based on voice recognition.\nThat also goes for the layout of the TV\u2019s webOS 25 Home Screen \u2013 if you customize the app selection in your user profile, it'll switch to the layout you prefer when it detects your voice if you use the voice control system at all.\nThe G5 also gets a gaming boost over last year\u2019s G4, with 4K 165Hz support for PC gaming along with Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium. LG\u2019s Gaming Portal offers over 500 game titles, with support for both Xbox and Luna controllers and Xbox Game Pass (coming in the first half of 2025, according to LG).\nUsability features include AirPlay 2 and Chromecast built-in, along with hands-free voice control. The ThinQ screen in the webOS interface lets you configure devices to be controlled via Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Matter and Apple HomeKit, and there\u2019s also a new, streamlined Magic Remote and more advanced AI Chatbot feature that can diagnose picture and sound issues.\n- Features Score: 5/5\nLG G5 review: Picture quality\n- Exceptional brightness for an OLED\n- Anti-reflection layer in the screen\n- Some issues with certain streaming formats\nThe LG G5 holds the distinction of being the brightest OLED TV we\u2019ve yet measured at TechRadar. Peak brightness on a 10% HDR white window pattern in Filmmaker Mode measured 2,268 nits, and it was 1,850 nits in Standard picture mode. Those numbers are what we typically expect to see from higher-end examples of the best mini-LED TVs, and they best the Samsung S95D \u2013 our previous brightest OLED TV champion \u2013 by a sizeable margin.\nThe G5\u2019s fullscreen HDR brightness measured 331 nits in Filmmaker Mode and 297 nits in Standard mode. That represents a boost over last year\u2019s G4, which measured 257 in Filmmaker Mode, but it\u2019s not the 40% fullscreen brightness boost that LG had previously cited for the G5. Measured in Vivid mode, the G5\u2019s fullscreen brightness was 419 nits, a number closer to LG\u2019s claim.\nThe G5\u2019s color gamut coverage measured 99.6% for UHDA-P3 and 81.3% for BT.2020 in Filmmaker Mode. Those results are better than what we measured on the G4, and they match the Samsung S95D\u2019s UHDA-P3 coverage.\nThe average Delta-E value (the margin of error between the test pattern source and what\u2019s shown on-screen) for color accuracy was 1.2, which is excellent. (Any result under 3 is regarded as indistinguishable to the human eye.)\nGiven the LG G5\u2019s high brightness, there was no need to dim the lights to make the picture look good \u2013 contrast, color saturation, and shadow detail all held up nicely even with my room\u2019s overhead lighting on. That\u2019s certainly not something you can say about all OLED TVs, which typically lag behind their mini-LED counterparts when it comes to brightness.\nEven with the comparatively subtle Filmmaker Mode active, The Pitt (streamed via Max), a TV show that mostly takes place in a brightly lit hospital emergency room, looked staggeringly bright on the G5.\nAnd darker shows such as Severance (on Apple TV+) could be watched in brighter room lighting conditions without losing black depth and shadow detail. That\u2019s partially due to the TV\u2019s anti-reflective layer, which manages to reduce screen glare without elevating black levels, but also its Filmmaker Mode Ambient Light setting, which uses the G5\u2019s light sensor to adjust gamma (or PQ for programs with HDR) based on room lighting conditions.\nViewing the season 2 final episode of Severance, a scene where Mark S and Helly R chat furtively in the Lumon office showed off all the LG G5's best aspects. The background of the dark workspace was a deep, rich black, and the light from the data terminals bathed their faces with a striking blue and green glow. The refined shadow detail gave the picture a powerful sense of depth that, for me, really drove home the point of why you would spend top dollar for a premium OLED TV like the G5.\nAn LG G5 review from our colleagues at What Hi-Fi? cited an issue with streamed Dolby Vision movies and shows, resulting in posterization and blocky picture artifacts when watching dark scenes. My G5 review sample showed the same posterization on at least one movie, Alien: Romulus (streamed via Apple TV), though it wasn't an issue on other streamed dark Dolby Vision content I watched.\nWhat Hi-Fi? later reported that an LG software update scheduled for a late April release fixes this Dolby Vision glitch, and after installing a pre-released version of that update, the posterization on Alien: Romulus disappeared, though it created other picture quality issues when streaming from the G5's Apple TV app, adding strange horizontal lines in some dark scenes.\nWithout these problems, the TV would score five stars for picture quality. These problems are very situational, which means I'm still happy giving the TV an overall score that marks it as best-in-class. Once we've fully tested the wide release version of LG's software update, we will update this review, and if these problems are removed as expected, I'll update this section.\nThe G5\u2019s motion handling was impressive, with a reference clip from No Time to Die \u2013 in which James Bond traverses a rugged hillside cemetery as the camera pans along \u2013 showing only minimal judder and blur. This same scene can look downright wobbly on some TVs.\nEnabling the TV's Cinematic Movement setting in the TruMotion menu effectively removed any residual motion artifacts without introducing a 'soap opera' effect.\nSports also looked great \u2013 the NCAA basketball championship aired during my time testing the G5 \u2013 with fast motion looking solid and the TV\u2019s bright, contrast-rich picture bringing out the vivid colors of the players\u2019 uniforms.\n- Picture quality score: 4.5/5\nLG G5 review: Sound quality\n- 4.2-channel speaker system\n- Effective AI Sound Pro mode\n- Sound Wizard for creating custom sound preset\nThe LG G5\u2019s built-in 4.2-channel speakers take things up a notch from the 2.2-channel array built into the LG C5. An AI Sound Pro mode provides a virtual 11.1.2-channel upmix that makes a clear difference in the spaciousness of soundtracks when watching movies, but it also thins out the bass.\nWhile Dolby Atmos is supported on the G5, DTS formats, disappointingly, are not. This is a step backwards from the G4, which had DTS support \u2013 though this won't be a problem for people using an AV receivers, and some soundbar setups.\nSimilar to the TV\u2019s Picture Wizard, a Sound Wizard guides you through the process of creating a customized sound preset. This is entirely optional, and this preset doesn\u2019t work when the TV is connected to a soundbar.\nA useful WOW Orchestra mode lets you combine the output of the TV\u2019s speakers with the speakers of a compatible LG soundbar when used together, for a bigger overall soundstage.\nThe movies and TV shows I watched on the G5 all sounded good, with clear dialogue and good spatial positioning of effects, especially with the AI Sound Pro mode active. The sound could also go fairly loud without coming across as strained.\nEven so, given how good the G5\u2019s picture looks, it would be a shame not to pair it with one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars or dedicated home theater speakers.\n- Sound quality score: 4/5\nLG G5 review: Design\n- Wall-mount hardware included\n- Optional pedestal stand\n- New, streamlined AI Magic Remote control\nThe G5 comes with wall-mounting hardware at all screen sizes, and a pedestal stand is available as an optional extra in the US. In the UK, you can choose if you want the stand or the mount in some sizes.\nLG\u2019s sturdy aluminum stand, which I used during my G5 review, allows for both an elevated height to accommodate a soundbar, or a lower height where the TV sits directly on the stand\u2019s surface.\nG5 TVs are designed to be wall-mounted, with the thin, 1-inch panel aligning perfectly flat against a wall like a picture frame when you use the dedicated mount.\nThe TV\u2019s nearly non-existent bezel gives it an 'all-picture' look that adds to the art-like quality, and a connection panel located on the back with bottom and side-mounted ports, along with cable management hardware, lets you hook up sources without detracting from the neat look.\nConnections on the G5 include four HDMI 2.1 inputs, an RF antenna input, three USB ports and an Ethernet port.\nLG\u2019s new AI Magic Remote for the G5 is more compact and streamlined than previous Magic Remotes, with a flat surface, a reduced button layout, and a smaller central scroll wheel. Unfortunately, not all regions get this new, mostly improved design, though it was included with my review sample in the US.\nThe UK still gets a design with channel buttons, though it does include new AI keys.\nThe new AI button provides quick Chatbot access, and there\u2019s also a dedicated button to call up the TV\u2019s ThinQ screen. I never really had a problem with the previous Magic Remote, but some users may prefer the more traditional design of this new version.\n- Design score: 4.5/5\nLG G5 review: Smart TV and menus\n- webOS 25 smart interface\n- Always Ready feature with 'ambient mode' option\n- Quick Cards and Quick Menu for easy app and settings access\nThe G5 uses LG\u2019s webOS 25 interface, which is one of the best smart TV systems going. Like other smart TV interfaces, the top third is dedicated to a promotional banner (in this case, one mostly directing you to the LG Channels free ad-supported TV portal), alas, but below that is a Quick Cards section that provides hubs for Sports, Games, Music, Home and more.\nThe Home Card hub provides information about connected wired and wireless sources, which can be accessed using the TV\u2019s remote control. It also lets you connect to Google Home, Matter, and LG ThinQ smart devices, which can be controlled directly from the TV.\nThe order of apps in the home screen\u2019s middle section can be edited according to which ones you use most, and there\u2019s also a Live TV option that shows a grid of both broadcast TV channels pulled in by the best indoor antennas and ones available on the LG Channels portal.\nAn Always Ready feature that needs to be enabled in the General menu lets you display images (including from your personal photo library) when you\u2019re not using the TV, including ones that can be generated using AI. When in Always Ready mode, the voice recognition and AirPlay/Chromecast remain active, so you don\u2019t have to power it on to use those functions.\nA very useful webOS feature is the Quick Menu, which appears as a transparent overlay on the screen\u2019s left side that lets you select between picture and sound modes, among other settings. You can also access the TV\u2019s AI Chatbot from here, which can be used to guide you through the G5\u2019s many settings and features.\nThe TV\u2019s AI Picture wizard can be useful for creating a preset that corresponds to your preferences, but I found that the one I dialed in was overly cool-looking for my preference, despite it theoretically following my preferences, and I stuck with Filmmaker Mode instead for most viewing.\nWhile I generally found navigating the TV\u2019s menus to be easy, and was satisfied with the wide range of options for adjusting picture and sound, I found it annoying that the new, redesigned Magic Remote control lacks an input button for switching sources.\nIt\u2019s easy enough to do that by pressing the Home hub button on the remote and then navigating to a specific source, but input select is nonetheless a button that should be included on every TV remote.\n- Smart TV & menus score: 5/5\nLG G5 review: Gaming\n- Four HDMI 2.1 ports\n- 4K 165Hz, FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync\n- 9.2ms input lag (Boost mode)\nLG TVs have fantastic gaming credentials, and the G5 continues in that tradition of the best gaming TVs. Its four HDMI ports support 4K 165Hz, FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync. Input lag measured in Game Optimizer mode with a Bodnar 4K input lag meter was 9.2ms in Boost mode, which is about as low as TVs get.\nThe G5\u2019s Game Card Gamung Hub offers over 500 games and apps, including Nvidia GeForce Now and Luna. (Xbox Game Pass support is coming in the first half of 2025, according to LG.)\nWhen in Game Optimizer mode, a Game Dashboard pop-menu provides quick access to a range of adjustments and presets, which can be selected without pausing the game you\u2019re playing.\nThe brightness level of the G5 is great here, again, because it means its good for playing in the day time without severe mirrored reflections distracting from what you're trying to focus on.\n- Gaming score: 5/5\nLG G5 review: Value\n- Priced competitively with premium OLED competition\n- Step-down LG C5 OLED also excellent\n- Very good overall value\nAt $3,399 / \u00a33,299 / AU$5,299 for the 65-inch model I tested, the LG G5 is priced higher than another 2025 premium OLED, the Samsung S95F, which has a similarly high brightness as the G5 plus a Glare-Free 2.0 screen that\u2019s even more effective at eliminating reflections in bright rooms.\nThe G5 is also priced lower in the US than another 2025 premium OLED, the Sony Bravia 8 II, which will sell for $3,999 in a 65-inch screen size\u2026 however, in the UK, the Bravia 8 II is actually priced slightly lower than the 65-inch G5, just to mix things\nIf you don\u2019t require super-high brightness and want to save some money, the LG C5 ($2,699 / \u00a32,699 at 65 inches) is an excellent choice. The C5\u2019s peak brightness is roughly half of what we measured on the G5, but it's full of features and its picture quality is still exceptional, especially when viewed in a light-controlled environment.\nGiven its fantastic all-around performance, great features, and more affordable cost compared to some of its high-end OLED competition, the G5 earns high ratings for value.\n- Value score: 4/5\nShould I buy the LG G5?\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nFeatures | A great array of features make the G5 a flexible TV that can accommodate bright rooms | 5/5 |\nPicture quality | Class-leading brightness for an OLED TV plus refined all-around picture quality | 4.5/5 |\nSound quality | Good dialogue clarity and effects positioning, along with a wide soundstage in AI Sound Pro mode, but bass is limited | 4/5 |\nDesign | Slim, wall-hugging design and smart new remote. The stand is optional, keep in mind | 4.5/5 |\nSmart TV and menus | Useful Quick Cards and Quick menu features are enhanced by voice recognition, viewer personalization, and AI chatbot | 5/5 |\nGaming | 4K 165Hz and premium VRR support, along with low input lag and cloud gaming apps, make the G5 a complete gaming package | 5/5 |\nValue | A good value for a flagship OLED TV in 2025, although LG\u2019s mid-range C5 is arguably the better value in light controlled rooms | 4/5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want to watch in bright rooms\nThe G5 OLED\u2019s brightness rivals that of premium mini-LEDs. It also features an effective anti-glare screen and a Filmmaker Ambient Light Mode that compensates for brighter rooms without sacrificing picture accuracy.\nYou want a TV for wall-mounting\nWith a slim, wall-hugging design, the G5 is specifically designed for wall-mounting and a specially designed bracket is provided.\nYou want a great TV for gaming\nWith support for 4K 165Hz, FreeSync Premium, and Nvidia G-Sync, and an impressively low 9.1ms input lag, the G5 is about as good as gaming TVs get.\nDon't buy it if\u2026\nYou don\u2019t want to use a soundbar\nThe G5\u2019s 4.2-channel speakers deliver more than adequate sound, but a TV this impressive should ideally be paired with a soundbar or external speakers for a complete experience.\nYou want HDR10+ support\nLG TVs support Dolby Vision, but not the HDR10+ high dynamic range format. That could be an issue if you have some 4K Blu-rays that include this format and not Dolby Vision.\nYou want to save money\nLG\u2019s mid-range C5 series OLED TVs aren\u2019t as bright as the G5 series, but they cost considerably less and also provide excellent picture quality and a great array of features.\nLG G5 review: Also consider...\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | LG G5 | Samsung S95F | LG C5 | Sony Bravia 9 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\nPrice (65-inch) | $3.399 / \u00a33,399 / AU$5,299 | $3,299 | $2,699 / \u00a32,699 / AU$4,299 | $2,999 / \u00a32,999 |\nScreen type | OLED | OLED | OLED | Mini-LED |\nRefresh rate | 165Hz | 144Hz | 144Hz | 144Hz |\nHDR support | Dolby Vision/HDR10/HLG | HDR10+/HDR10/HLG | Dolby Vision/HDR10/HLG | Dolby Vision/HDR10/HLG |\nSmart TV | webOS25 | Tizen | webOS25 | Google TV |\nHDMI ports | 4 x HDMI 2.1 | 4 x HDMI 2.1 | 4 x HDMI 2.1 | 4 (2x HDMI 2.1) |\nSamsung S95F\nWe haven\u2019t yet reviewed the Samsung S95F, but we have seen it in action extensively and, like the G5, it combines an impressively bright OLED picture with effective anti-screen reflection tech. Initial US pricing for the S95F is also lower than for the G5.\nLG C5\nThe C5 isn\u2019t as bright as the G5, but it\u2019s a great all-around TV that\u2019s also feature-packed for the price, as we observed in our LG C5 review. This mid-range OLED is a good alternative if you don\u2019t need its picture to stand out high ambient light viewing environments.\nSony Bravia 9\nSony\u2019s flagship TV is about as premium as mini-LED gets, and we appreciated its bright yet refined picture and powerful sound in our Sony Bravia 9 review. Like the G5, it\u2019s a pricey option, but a good choice if you prefer to not use a soundbar.\nHow I tested the LG G5\n- I spent about 20 hours in total measuring and evaluating\n- Measurements were made using Calman color calibration software\n- A full calibration was made before proceeding with subjective tests\nWhen I test TVs, I first spend a few days or even weeks using it for casual viewing to assess the out-of-box picture presets and get familiar with its smart TV menu and picture adjustments. I next select the most accurate preset (usually Filmmaker Mode, Movie or Cinema) and measure grayscale and color accuracy using Portrait Displays\u2019 Calman color calibration software.\nThe resulting measurements provide Delta-E values (the margin of error between the test pattern source and what\u2019s shown on-screen) for each category, and allow for an assessment of the TV\u2019s overall accuracy.\nAlong with those tests, I make measurements of peak light output (recorded in nits) for both standard high-definition and 4K high dynamic range using 10% and 100% white window patterns. Coverage of DCI-P3 and BT.2020 color space is also measured, with the results providing a sense of how faithfully the TV can render the extended color range in ultra high-definition sources.\nFor the LG G5, I used the Calman ISF workflow, along with the TV\u2019s advanced picture menu settings, to calibrate the image for best accuracy. I also watched a range of reference scenes on 4K Blu-ray discs to assess the TV\u2019s performance, along with shows streamed from Max, Netflix, and other services.\nYou can read an in-depth overview of how we test TVs at TechRadar for more information.\n- First reviewed: April 2025\n- Read TechRadar's reviews guarantee\nAl Griffin has been writing about and reviewing A/V tech since the days LaserDiscs roamed the earth, and was previously the editor of Sound & Vision magazine.\nWhen not reviewing the latest and greatest gear or watching movies at home, he can usually be found out and about on a bike.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "Flagship OLED TV showdown: Viewers saw LG, Samsung, Sony and Panasonic TVs in a blind test and chose their favorite\nOver the past few weeks, I\u2019ve compared TVs side-by-side, everything from flagship OLEDs to an entry-level OLED and a mid-range mini-LED TV. But one other, more ambitious test I conducted might be the most revealing of all.\nTechRadar rarely gets to conduct a simultaneous test of flagship OLED TVs from every major brand, but recently we found ourselves with the Samsung S95F, LG G5, Sony Bravia 8 II and Panasonic Z95B, four of the best TVs of 2025, under one roof, which made the prospect of a side-by-side evaluation irresistible.\nHowever, our group test was a little different than the standard expert evaluation as we recruited several colleagues to help us determine which was the best OLED TV. Crucially, this was a blind test, with each TV\u2019s logo covered up. To identify the different models, they were referred to solely by a number: 1 (Samsung S95F), 2 ( LG G5), 3 (Sony Bravia 8 II) and 4 (Panasonic Z95B). In all photos, these numbers correspond with the placement of the TVs from left to right.\nFor this article, however, I will refer to the TVs by their model numbers.\nBefore we get into the results, these were the testing criteria and conditions. The TVs were judged purely on picture quality, looking at five areas: black levels/contrast, color, fast-paced action movies, motion (sports), and upscaling. Our testers were asked to pick their favorite for each category, and this would earn the TV a point.\nFor settings, all the TVs were set to the Cinema/Movie picture preset for all sections except sports, where we switched to the Standard mode. Also, other than switching off brightness optimization or ambient light settings (which automatically adjust brightness based on the room lighting conditions), the picture presets were left in their out-of-the-box settings.\nNow on with the results!\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nBlack levels/dark movie viewing\nFor the first test, we asked our panel to pick their favorite OLED TV for dark movie scenes, focusing on contrast, black levels and shadow detail.\nThe clip we chose for this was the opening crime scene from The Batman, a movie with a low mastered brightness (400 nits compared to the industry standard 1,000 nits) that can reveal issues such as black crush or raised black levels. It\u2019s also a high-contrast scene, with plenty of light from lamps and torches balanced against dark surroundings.\nThis test was conducted under regular ambient room lighting conditions, with a lamp off to one side to simulate a living room. Afterwards, we turned on the overhead lights in our testing room, focusing on any screen glare caused by the bright overhead lighting.\nThe winner of this test was the Samsung S95F, which, with its Glare Free screen, maintained strong contrast in both lighting situations, displaying high peak brightness, deep blacks, and refined shadows. Overall, it earned nine votes out of twelve.\nSome comments from our testers: \u201cI prefer the Samsung, it did best in both conditions.\u201d Also, \u201cSamsung had a lot more detail when it brightened up.\u201d\nThe Panasonic Z95B also did well in this test, earning two votes out of twelve. Some of our testers stated that it \u201cwas the best to watch\u201d and it \u201chas the best balance and it\u2019s the most accurate\u201d.\nThe LG G5 earned a single vote, but multiple commenters noted that it was \u201ctoo bright for the scene.\u201d\nThe Sony Bravia 8 II struggled the most in this test, earning no votes. Comments included, \u201cThe Sony is way too dim,\u201d and \u201cThe Sony is so dark you lose detail.\u201d However, one panelist did say they \u201cliked the contrast of the Sony when Gordon shone his torch,\u201d indicating that it got the balance right. Despite this last comment, the Sony Bravia 8 II earned no votes.\nWinner: Samsung S95F\nTV | Number of votes (out of 12) |\nSamsung S95F | 9 |\nLG G5 | 1 |\nSony Bravia 8 II | 0 |\nPanasonic Z95B | 2 |\nColor\nFor our next test, we asked our panel to judge color reproduction based on accuracy, vibrancy, and which TV they just generally preferred.\nThe scene we chose for this test was from The Wild Robot. This beautifully animated movie has colors that are both eye-popping and natural-looking, making for a perfect testing scene. We chose one scene from early in the movie, where \u2018Roz\u2019 (the robot) interacts with a tree covered in butterflies that shows dazzling yellow, red and orange hues.\nThis was a closely fought contest between the Samsung S95F and the LG G5. One thing that was very interesting was that our panel actually struggled to tell the two TVs apart. With all TVs set to Cinema mode, our panel said the two \u201chave a similar color profile and color range\u201d. As a result, it was a back-and-forth, with some commenting that the Samsung \u201chas the best colors with the most pop,\u201d and the LG \u201chas a glow.\u201d It ultimately came down to the S95F earning six votes to the G5\u2019s five.\nThe Sony Bravia 8 II and Panasonic Z95B struggled in this test. Commenters said, \u201cBoth Panasonic and Sony look super dull,\u201d and \u201cSony doesn\u2019t have the eye-popping color you want\u201d. The Z95B did earn one vote in this test, while the Bravia 8 II earned none.\nWinner: Samsung S95F\nTV | Number of votes (out of 12) |\nSamsung S95F | 6 |\nLG G5 | 5 |\nSony Bravia 8 II | 0 |\nPanasonic Z95B | 1 |\nAction\nThe next test involved a fast-paced action movie, with lots of onscreen motion. We gave guidance to our panel to check which TV had the smoothest motion, but ultimately, we just wanted to see which one they preferred to watch.\nFor this test, we chose the dogfighting training mission from Top Gun: Maverick. This scene has a lot of quick panning shots and weaving jets, and is an excellent test for motion handling.\nOnce again, the Samsung S95F came out on top. Our panel commented, \u201cThe Samsung has the most fluid movement\u201d and is \u201cthe right side of smooth,\u201d meaning it avoided the dreaded soap opera effect. Someone also felt it \u201cgave the most cinematic experience.\u201d In this test, the S95F earned seven out of twelve votes.\nThe Panasonic Z95B also received many compliments, including ones that cited it as the \u201cmost fluid with motion\u201d and \u201c the nicest on the eye.\u201d The Z95B ended up receiving three votes, while the LG G5, which went fairly under the radar in this test, received two votes.\nThis was once again a tough test for the Sony Bravia 8 II, although one viewer did feel that the Sony \u201chad the best motion.\u201d For us as test facilitators, we ended up surprised that Sony didn\u2019t do better, as Sony\u2019s TVs traditionally have some of the best motion processing on the market. The Bravia 8 II received no votes.\nWinner: Samsung S95F\nTV | Number of votes (out of 12) |\nSamsung S95F | 7 |\nLG G5 | 2 |\nSony Bravia 8 II | 0 |\nPanasonic Z95B | 3 |\nUpscaling\nTo test which TV had the best upscaling, we used a DVD of The Amazing Spider-Man played through a Panasonic DP-UB820 4K Blu-ray player with its upscaling turned off.\nIn a truly dominant performance, the LG G5 earned a clean sweep of 12 votes. It easily had the brightest picture, with the best upscaling of textures, color and contrast. Our panel noted that \u201cdetails such as hair are more refined\u201d and that the \u201dLG is good at sharpening the background as well as faces and other textures.\u201d\nWhy did the other TVs not fare as well? This was the first time that the Samsung S95F\u2019s picture had been cited as \u201ctoo dark,\u201d and there\u2019s a reason for this. In SDR Cinema mode (the picture mode used for this test), the S95F\u2019s default brightness is set to 18 out of 50, which makes the picture appear a lot darker than it otherwise would be.\nThe Panasonic Z95B arguably received the comment of the day when someone said it looks like \u201cdeep-fried memes,\u201d referring to the oversharpening of the image. Sony, on the other hand, received positive feedback as someone called it the \u201cmost natural looking.\u201d Even so, it couldn\u2019t de-throne the LG G5 on this test.\nWinner: LG G5\nTV | Number of votes (out of 12) |\nSamsung S95F | 0 |\nLG G5 | 12 |\nSony Bravia 8 II | 0 |\nPanasonic Z95B | 0 |\nSports\nOur final test involved sports viewing, with panelists looking at which TV displayed sports most accurately, for both with motion and color. For this test, all the TVs were set to their Standard picture mode (as some didn\u2019t have a Sports mode), with the default motion settings active. For the test, we used a stream of the MLS All-Star soccer game via Prime Video.\nThis was the most evenly fought contest out of all the tests. Some complimented the LG G5, saying its \u201cmotion looked the best - it has the fluidity you want when watching sports,\u201d and that it \u201clooks the most crisp.\u201d There was also criticism of the G5, with commenters saying it \u201cwas too oversaturated\u201d and it had \u201ctoo cool a color temperature.\u201d Still, the G5 received four votes.\nThe G5 was actually a joint four-vote winner with the Panasonic Z95B, which received compliments such as, \"It has the best color contrast,\u201d and \u201cit has the best pitch color.\u201d However, other comments said it was \u201ctoo dark.\u201d\nThe S95F and Bravia 8 II scored two points each. The S95F was said to \u201clook the most natural\u201d and also that it \u201clooks the clearest,\u201d although there were some \u201cobvious motion artifacts\u201d such as the ghosting of a ball. One panelist said of the S95F, they \u201cwished it were brighter\u201d. The Sony Bravia 8 II was said to be \u201ctoo juddery\u201d and \u201cnot as fluid,\u201d but was also called \u201cthe most natural\u201d by one person.\nTie: LG G5 and Panasonic Z95B\nTV | Number of votes (out of 12) |\nSamsung S95F | 2 |\nLG G5 | 4 |\nSony Bravia 8 II | 2 |\nPanasonic Z95B | 4 |\nFinal results\nOur test ended up being a draw between the Samsung S95F and LG G5, with both receiving a total of 24 points each. Now, the G5 is helped by its clean sweep in the upscaling test, which earned it 12 points, but by the numbers, it\u2019s still a tie!\nWithout the upscaling test result, the Samsung S95F had the most consistent victories across each category, with three wins out of five, while the G5 earned two wins and the Z95B earned one.\nUnfortunately for Sony, the Bravia 8 II didn\u2019t do well in our bank of tests, and the main reason for this was its comparative lack of brightness. It\u2019s worth noting that the Bravia 8 II\u2019s brightness can be improved by changing Dynamic Tone Mapping in the settings to \u2018Brightness Preferred,\u2019 but this comes at the expense of picture accuracy.\nConsidering the Bravia 8 II uses a QD-OLED panel, we expected it to be brighter. But as these tests were done with out-of-the-box settings, the Bravia 8 II struggled against its rivals.\nNone of this is to say that the Sony Bravia 8 II or Panasonic Z95B are unworthy TVs (the Bravia 8 II scored an excellent 4.5 out of 5 stars in our review). But ultimately, in our casual test with these TVs in their default settings, the Samsung and LG were the victors in the eyes of our panel.\nTie: Samsung S95F and LG G5\nTV | Dark movie | Color | Action | Upscaling | Sports | Total |\nSamsung S95F | 9 | 6 | 7 | 0 | 2 | 24 |\nLG G5 | 1 | 5 | 2 | 12 | 4 | 24 |\nSony Bravia 8 II | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 |\nPanasonic Z95B | 2 | 1 | 3 | 0 | 4 | 10 |\nYou might also like\n- I tested LG, Samsung and Sony's elite 2025 OLED TVs side-by-side \u2013 here's the one I'd buy with my own money\n- I tested Samsung and LG's cheapest OLED TVs side-by-side to see which TV comes out on top \u2013 here's what happened\n- I tested the Samsung S95F and LG G5 OLED TVs side-by-side: here's which one you should get\nJames is the TV Hardware Staff Writer at TechRadar.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Samsung S95F is a fantastic OLED TV that delivers exceptional picture quality, particularly with its brightness and color, while also eliminating mirror-like reflections in bright rooms with its OLED Glare Free 2.0 screen. It's also excellent for gaming, looks physically stunning, and even delivers solid sound. Its AI tools may not be for everyone, black levels may be a little flawed compared to the LG G5, and it does carry a premium price, but the S95F is nonetheless an outstanding TV.\nPros\n- +\nExcellent brightness and color\n- +\nEffective matte anti-glare screen\n- +\nExtensive gaming features\nCons\n- -\nSome minor black crush in places\n- -\nPricey\n- -\nNo Dolby Vision support\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nSamsung S95F: Two minute review\nThe Samsung S95F is the brand\u2019s 2025 flagship OLED TV, delivering a premium set of features with the performance to match, pushing brightness levels for this kind of TV to some new highs.\nThe Samsung S95F boasts an impressive list of features, including a number of AI-based enhancement tools for picture, such as 4K Upscaling Pro and Real Depth Enhancer, and sound, such as AI Sound and Active Voice Amplifier Pro, as well as an AI assistant for live TV show analysis and recommendations.\nPicture quality on the S95F is excellent overall. Delivering staggering brightness levels that produce punchy vibrant colors, as well as rich contrast, black levels and extremely realistic textures, the S95F is a sight to behold even compared to the best OLED TVs.\nOne thing to note here is that I reviewed the 55-inch version, which uses a new-gen QD-OLED screen, as does the 65-inch and 77-inch version, though the 83-inch size uses the same W-OLED new-gen panel as the LG G5. The benchmark measurements in this review are from the 55-inch model \u2013 I have also measured an 83-inch version, and included some information about that in the Picture Quality section, but those tests weren't done in our usual testing areas, and the set was tested pre-release, so may not totally match what you'll buy today, but I've included them for reference.\nIts OLED Glare Free 2.0 screen delivers the same impressive reflection-beating performance as its predecessor, the Samsung S95D, but improves on black crush issues I found with the S95D. There is still some black crush present, and motion does require some tweaking to get to your own tastes, but the S95F still delivers picture quality that\u2019s up there with the best TVs.\nBuilt-in sound is punchy, accurate and delivers plenty of solid bass for such a thin TV, while also delivering clear speech and effective virtual surround sound. Atmos effects are still a little lacking and the soundstage can feel narrow at times, but most will be pleased with the S95F\u2019s sound quality. Cinephiles: I\u2019d still recommend one of the best soundbars.\nThe S95F is a physically stunning TV with a razor-thin, sharp and sleek design that gives it a premium look. Its One Connect Box, its external box for cable management and housing of ports, keeps things neat and tidy: excellent for those looking to wall-mount. Its stand requires a two person installation due to its weighty, metal design but it just makes the S95F feel that much more premium.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nTizen 9.0 is used as the smart TV platform for the S95F and it\u2019s an improvement over previous generations. It\u2019s smooth, mostly stutter-free and has plenty of picture settings, including AI ones, to tweak the picture to your liking. Recommendations are very good and although the home page can look a little cluttered and some settings are buried in menus, it\u2019s definitely an upgrade over previous generations of Tizen.\nThe S95F is easily among one of the best gaming TVs of 2025. It supports 4K, 165Hz, VRR with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, ALLM and HDR10+ gaming across four HDMI 2.1 ports, as well as boasting an ultra-low 9.5ms input lag time. Its Game Hub offers tons of cloud gaming options for those without a console and delivers razor-sharp performance and picture when gaming.\nTo get this premium performance, you have to pay a premium price. The S95F is similarly priced to its closest rivals, namely the LG G5, and while the price may be a bit lofty for some at launch, there will no doubt be discounts throughout its life cycle. For now though, it still mostly justifies its high price tag.\nShould you buy this or the LG G5, which we also gave five stars to? I think the LG G5 just has the edge in most cases, thanks to its Dolby Vision support and the way it keeps black tones as dark and accurate as possible in more conditions. I think the Samsung is the better choice in really bright rooms where you know reflections are a challenge, or for aesthetes who love the idea of the One Connect box keeping cable clutter out of the way.\nSamsung S95F review: Prices & release date\n- Release date: May 2025\n- 55-inch: $2,499 / \u00a32,499 / N/A\n- 65-inch: $3,399 / \u00a33,399 / AU$5,295\n- 77-inch: $4,499 / \u00a34,299 / AU$7,995\n- 83-inch: $6,499 / \u00a36,799 / AU$9,995\nThe Samsung S95F is the brand\u2019s 2025 flagship OLED TV, sitting above the mid-range Samsung S90F and the entry-level Samsung S85F in its OLED TV lineup. The 55-inch model I tested launched at a price of $2,499 / \u00a32,499, with the popular 65-inch model available for $3,399 / \u00a33,399 / AU$5,295.\nSeveral weeks on from launch, prices remain largely unchanged, although we've seen a $200 / \u00a3200 discount on the 55-inch model and sometimes the 65-inch model. There's sure to be more price drops throughout the year, as is normal for TVs.\nSamsung S95F review: Specs\nScreen type | QD-OLED |\nRefresh rate | Up to 165Hz |\nHDR support | HDR10+, HDR10, HLG |\nAudio support | Dolby Atmos |\nSmart TV | Tizen |\nHDMI ports | 4 x HDMI 2.1 |\nBuilt-in tuner | ATSC 3.0 (US) |\nSamsung S95F review: Benchmark results\nSamsung S95F review: Features\n- Glare Free 2.0 matte screen\n- NQ4 AI Gen 3 processor with AI tools\n- One Connect box for external connections\nThe Samsung S95F uses a QD-OLED panel in its 55, 65 and 77-inch models, but the largest 83-inch model uses the new Primary Tandem RGB, or \u2018four-stack\u2019, OLED panel: the same used in the LG G5.\nThe S95F comes with the OLED Glare Free 2.0 screen: an updated version of the anti-reflection, matte screen found in its predecessor, the Samsung S95D.\nIt\u2019s equipped with the NQ4 AI Gen 3 processor, which offers AI based enhancements such as Real Depth Enhancer, 4K AI Upscaling Pro, Auto HDR Remastering Pro, Color Booster Pro and AI Motion Enhancer Pro. There are also AI Customization settings for both picture and sound which can be tweaked.\nAs always, the S95F supports HDR10+, HDR10 and HLG HDR formats, but there is no support for Dolby Vision. It also supports Dolby Atmos enhanced sound format, but there is no support for DTS.\nFor audio, the S95F comes with a built-in 4.2.2 channel speaker array, totaling 70W of power. It has the Object Tracking Sound+ (OTS+) system for more accurate sound mapping as well as AI Sound mode with voice enhancement. It also supports Samsung\u2019s Q-Symphony feature, where the TV can be used in tandem with compatible Samsung soundbars as an extra speaker.\nThe S95F is also a well equipped gaming TV, with four HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K, 165Hz, VRR (AMD FreeSync Premium Pro included), ALLM and HDR10+ gaming. Its Game Hub is a useful portal for housing all things gaming, including cloud based gaming apps from Xbox, Luna, Nvidia GeForce Now and more.\nIn terms of physical features, the S95F\u2019s most significant addition is the One Connect Box, an external box designed to house all connections such as HDMI and USB, connected to the TV by a single cable that carries power as well as video. For US viewers, the S95F carries an ATSC 3.0 tuner.\nThe S95F uses Samsung\u2019s Tizen as its smart TV platform and has access to all major streaming apps such as Netflix, Prime Video and Disney Plus, as well as UK based apps such as ITVX and BBC iPlayer. Tizen has several hubs to house relevant apps including Home, the aforementioned Game, Ambient and Daily+.\n- Features score: 5/5\nSamsung S95F review: Picture quality\nChoosing the right picture mode for bright conditions can be important depending on the movie. The Batman is a particularly dim movie.\n- Spectacular color and brightness\n- Very effective anti-reflection screen\n- Improved black levels over the S95D\nStarting with my measurements of the 55-inch S95F\u2019s performance using out-of-the-box settings, the TV hit 2,132 nits of HDR peak brightness (measured on a 10% HDR white window pattern) in Filmmaker Mode. When I measured a pre-release version of the 83-inch model at a Samsung event, which has a different type of OLED screen (the same as the LG G5), I measured 2,388 nits of peak HDR brightness in Filmmaker Mode on that model, which is a good 10% step up over the smaller option.\nThe LG G5, for comparison, measured 2,268 nits in HDR peak brightness in Filmmaker Mode, so sits closer to the 83-inch version of the S95F, which makes sense.\nThe 55-inch S95F achieved 2,135 nits of peak HDR brightness in Standard mode, while the 83-inch version hit 2,102 nits in the same test. The LG G5 hit 1,850 nits in Standard Mode, so the S95F has a clear edge over its rival in that kind of mode.\nI also measured the 55-inch S95F\u2019s Movie mode brightness, as I found myself using this mode with some movies in brighter conditions, and it hit 2,109 nits of peak HDR brightness.\nAs for HDR fullscreen brightness, important for sports, daytime and bright room viewing, the 55-inch S95F clocked 390 nits in Filmmaker Mode (measured on a 100% white HDR window pattern), making it the brightest 55-inch OLED we\u2019ve tested. It beat the previous champion, the LG G5, which clocked in 331 nits in its Filmmaker Mode.\nHowever, the the 83-inch version of the S95F I tested crushed its smaller sibling, achieving 465 nits of fullscreen brightness in Filmmaker Mode \u2013 a figure you expect from the best mini-LED TVs.\nWith SDR fullscreen brightness however, the LG G5 still holds the crown, hitting 327 nits in Filmmaker Mode, whereas the S95F clocked in at 181 nits.\nThe S95F\u2019s most unusual feature is its OLED Glare Free 2.0 screen, which like its predecessor, the S95D, eliminated mirror-like reflections even with bright overhead lights on in our testing room.\nThe issue with mirror-like reflections is that they're actually on a different focal plane to the TV, so when your eye catches them, you have to focus away from the rest of the screen. That's why they're so annoying, and are quite fatiguing to deal with. On the S95F they're reduced to just a haze at most.\nI found when I tested the S95D that the matte screen caused black crush, particularly in Filmmaker Mode, so you lost detail in the dark areas OLED is supposed to excel in \u2013 and thankfully the S95F has improved this. There were still some instances of black crush in dark scenes in movies like The Batman and Nosferatu, but they were minimal in comparison.\nI did find when watching dark movies in bright rooms, setting Dynamic Tone Mapping from the default Static to Active in Filmmaker Mode gave it a solid brightness boost without sacrificing black levels or contrast too much, and helped to reduce the black crush.\nWhere the S95F really shines with its picture is its colors. Watching a 4K stream of Elemental on Disney Plus, fire characters \u2013 as well as Ember\u2019s glass and vase-making \u2013 deliver stunning, glistening reds and oranges with a real vivid punch in highlight areas of the screen.\nA 4K Blu-ray of Wicked also demonstrated natural but vibrant colors, particularly in the Wizard & I scene where Elphaba stands among pink flowers. I preferred Filmmaker Mode\u2019s accuracy, but those looking for a brighter dose of color can select Movie mode for something that's bold but still realistic.\nIt\u2019s no surprise the 55-inch S95F delivered such spectacular HDR colors, because when I measured its HDR color gamut coverage, it yielded results of 100% and 89.3% in the DCI-P3 and BT.2020 color spaces. These are not only phenomenal results, but it\u2019s also the first time a TV has hit 100% DCI-P3 in my time testing TVs. I measured the 83-inch S95F at 94.9% of P3 color gamut coverage, however \u2013 this is surprisingly low, considering the LG G5 with the same panel achieved 99.6%, so it might be best to take it with a pinch of salt, since I tested it pre-release.\nBlack levels and contrast are still excellent on the S95F, particularly when viewed in dimmed or pitch black conditions. Watching The Batman, the subway fight and crime scene sequences showed deep black levels with brilliant contrast between dark areas and light areas from light sources such as lamps, torches and flashbulbs. Shadow detail was great as well, with objects on walls still visible even in dark sections.\nThe S95F was great for black and white movies, as scenes from Oppenheimer showed deep black tones, vibrant white tones and a full range of gray tones with fantastic depth and texture.\nSpeaking of textures, the S95F showed a near 3D-like quality for every 4K movie I used. Clearly, the Real Depth Enhancer was hard at work, as every facial feature, skin tone and object looked accurate, lifelike and refined. I found the S95F\u2019s upscaling was effective when viewing an HD stream of Fight Club. While not as successful with lower resolution TV shows, textures were definitely still upscaled.\nMotion for the S95F was responsive, though I did find that Blur and Judder reduction needed to be set at 5 each, though this may require some adjusting for some. A panning shot of a cliffside in No Time To Die was smooth without the dreaded soap opera effect with these settings. For Sports, I opted for Standard Mode with these settings and found the action smooth without any ghosting of the ball during a stream of a soccer game.\nThe S95F is an overall fantastic TV, but I put it side-by-side with the LG G5 and while the S95F was better for bright room viewing, I couldn\u2019t help but admire the G5\u2019s richer, inkier black levels. It did make the S95F\u2019s black levels look gray in bright conditions by comparison. The matte screen obviously is a compromise, but thankfully some tweaking of the S95F\u2019s settings mentioned above can narrow the gap. It's even better if you can view in dimmed conditions.\n- Picture quality score: 5/5\nSamsung S95F: Sound quality\n- 4.2.2 channel, 70W speaker array\n- Object Tracking Sound+ (OTS+) for accurate mapping\n- Dolby Atmos, but no DTS support\nThe Samsung S95F comes equipped with a built-in 4.2.2 channel speaker array, with 70W of total power. It includes AI Sound mode options and supports Dolby Atmos soundtracks. There is no support for DTS soundtracks, however. There are two preset sound modes to choose from: Standard and Amplify.\nWith the S95F set to the Amplify sound mode, the Batmobile/Penguin chase scene in The Batman produced hefty, impactful bass and rumble from the Batmobile\u2019s engine and explosions. The OTS+ system was effective at mapping effects such as screeching tyres and gunfire and keeping the action on screen and sound tightly connected and controlled.\nThroughout Wicked, the S95F\u2019s speakers also delivered clear vocals and speech as well as a very good balance between said vocals and the uplifting and powerful score, which was itself delivered with clarity and precision.\nWhile its built-in sound is very good, I couldn\u2019t help but find the soundstage narrow in places and that its volume needed to be pushed to get the full experience. When pushed too high however, there can be some buzz from the bass. For a proper cinematic experience, one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars remains recommended.\nSamsung S95F review: Design\n- Super slim, modern design\n- One Connect Box for external connections\n- Solid, sleek metal base\nThe S95F is a sight to behold. Razor-thin with a bezel-less screen, the S95F is incredibly sleek and has an appealing modern look. It comes with a weighty, black metal stand and while assembly requires two people, once attached it gives the TV a floating look and feels solid and sturdy.\nThe S95F comes with the brand\u2019s One Connect Box, which houses the S95F\u2019s many connections, including four HDMI 2.1 ports, three USB ports, an optical port, tuner ports for broadcast TV and an Ethernet port. This box is then connected to the S95F via a single cable and the box itself can be housed on the back of the stand. It\u2019s ideal for those looking to wall-mount their TV with minimal cables.\nFor remotes, the S95F comes with the SolarCell remote, a small remote with volume control, app shortcuts and the new AI button, for AI assistant shortcuts. The remote can be charged via USB-C or the solar panel on the remote. UK users will also find an older-style remote with numbered buttons in the box as well as the SolarCell remote.\n- Design score: 5/5\nSamsung S95F review: Smart TV & menus\n- Tizen smart TV platform\n- Home, Game, Ambient and Daily+ hubs for apps\n- Good number of picture settings\nThe S95F uses Samsung\u2019s own Tizen smart TV platform, with this year\u2019s version called Tizen 9.0. It has access to all the major streaming apps, but UK users should note it does not include Freeview Play for broadcast TV, instead using Samsung\u2019s own Samsung TV Plus. UK based streaming apps are still available however.\nTizen 9.0\u2019s home page is split into three sections: For You, which houses AI-tailored content recommendations (which are mostly accurate and effective based on my own experience) Live, for live TV and Apps, for a fuller apps page list. For You is the default and while there is a large banner at the top of the screen, a neat, customizable row of apps sits at the bottom of the screen and is easily accessible.\nAside from the Home page, there are three other main hubs: Game for gaming based applications; Ambient, for an ambient mode in place of standby; and Daily+ for lifestyle and workplace based apps.\nMenu and settings navigation is made easier thanks to a quick menu, which I didn\u2019t find as effective as LG\u2019s but is still a welcome addition. Accessing the right menus and settings can be long-winded and navigation can stutter on occasion, but it was a mostly smooth experience.\nAs well as the usual picture and sound settings, of which there are a good amount for picture customization, there are a number of AI-based tools including AI picture and sound modes. There is an AI assistant as well. A press of the remote\u2019s AI button on a TV show on Samsung TV Plus gave me a summary of the show and recommended similar shows.\n- Smart TV & menus: 4.5/5\nSamsung S95F review: Gaming\n- 4K, 165Hz, VRR, ALLM and HDR10+ gaming\n- Ultra-low 9.5ms input lag time\n- Game Hub for cloud based gaming apps\nThe S95F is an extremely well featured TV for gaming. It features four HDMI ports that support 4K, 165Hz, VRR with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro supported, ALLM and HDR10+ gaming. Samsung\u2019s Game Hub continues to be an excellent portal for everything gaming related including a healthy choice of cloud based gaming apps from the likes of Xbox, Nvidia GeForce Now and Luna.\nAs with Samsung\u2019s TVs, the S95F is no slouch with gaming performance either. An ultra-low 9.5ms input lag time delivers a smooth experience with no hint of screen tear or stutter in performance whatsoever. Playing Battlefield V, intense combat sequences were exciting to play and targeting was easy, snappy and extremely responsive.\nThe S95F also delivers superb picture quality for gaming, with several levels in Battlefield V given a truly bright, vibrant and dynamic look filled with color and detail. Again Real Depth Enhancer Pro gave the picture a hyper-realistic look with fantastic detail in every object on screen.\n- Gaming score: 5/5\nSamsung S95F review: Value\n- Performance and features justify price\n- Closely priced with rivals\n- Still a premium priced TV\nValue is a tough area to judge for the Samsung S95F, as it carries most of the features you\u2019d ever need while also delivering high-quality performance, but this all comes at a premium price.\nThe 55-inch model I tested costs $2,299.99 / \u00a32,299 (roughly AU$3,554) at the time of writing. The S95F\u2019s main rival, the LG G5, 55-inch model costs $2,199.99 / \u00a32,199.99 / AU$3,495 at the time of writing, making the G5 the more tempting of the two. Expect prices to battle throughout the year, reducing over time.\nI\u2019d usually recommend the S95F\u2019s step-down sibling \u2013 the S90F \u2013 as a cheaper alternative, because the 55-inch model there costs $1,799 / \u00a31,899 / AU$3,299. However, there is no guarantee of getting a bright QD-OLED screen over a dimmer mid-tier W-OLED screen, which means I can\u2019t recommend it for certain. At 65 inches, you are guaranteed a QD-OLED panel, though, so at that size the S90F is a great option \u2013 here's our full 65-inch Samsung S90F review.\nThe S95F is a premium priced TV, there\u2019s no getting around it. While there are a number of cheaper options available, it does deliver an undoubtedly premium experience and does strongly justify its price.\n- Value score: 4/5\nShould you buy the Samsung S95F OLED TV?\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nFeatures | The Samsung S95F offers a stacked list of smart and gaming features, along with superb picture quality and solid audio quality.

Its the mini-LED equivalent of the S90F in Samsung's 2025 lineup, so if you're looking a feature-packed TV but with mini-LED, this is your best option.\nRead our full Samsung QN90F review\nHow I tested the Samsung S95F OLED TV\n- Tested over a week\n- Tested in different lighting conditions in our testing lab\n- Measurements taken using Portrait Displays' Calman color calibration software\nBefore my critical testing, I first spent time establishing the most accurate picture modes that I would use for both subjective testing and objective measurements. I landed on Filmmaker Mode and sometimes used Movie mode, depending on lighting conditions.\nI tested the S95F's using reference scenes from both Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) sources, such as DVD, Blu-ray and broadcast/low-resolution TV, and High Dynamic Range (HDR) sources, such as 4K Blu-ray and 4K streaming.\nFor 4K Blu-ray, I used a Panasonic DP-UB820 4K Blu-ray player, our pick for the best 4K Blu-ray player.\nI used these sources to analyse the S95F's picture quality, focusing on color, contrast, black levels, textures, upscaling, as well as sound quality and motion for sports and movies.\nI also watched the S95F with various different lighting conditions to test the effectiveness of its OLED Glare Free anti-reflection screen.\nFor objective measurements, I used a Klein K10A colorimeter, Murideo Six G 8K test pattern generator and recorded measurements using Portrait Displays' Calman color calibration software.\nI focused on SDR and HDR brightness measurements, with a focus on peak (10%) and fullscreen (100%) brightness, color and grayscale accuray by taking the average of the Delta-E values (the margin for error between the source pattern signal and what's shown on screen) and HDR color gamut coverage, focusing on DCI-P3 (also called UHDA-P3) and BT.2020 color spaces.\nI also analyzed the S95F's gaming performance using an Xbox Series X, and a Leo Bodnar 4K HDMI Input Lag Tester to analyze its input lag in milliseconds.\nFor more on how we test TVs at TechRadar, check out the link.\n- First reviewed: June 2025\n- Read TechRadar's reviews guarantee\nJames is the TV Hardware Staff Writer at TechRadar.

But there are also several specific gaming requirements you need to consider as well.\nFor our list of the best gaming TVs, we prioritize things a bit different to our overall list of the best TVs. For example, we want gaming TVs need to have a low level of input lag, meaning there isn't a delay between you pressing a button and what you see on your screen. We also want them to have HDMI 2.1 support on as many HDMI ports as possible, so they're future-proof, and to have great gaming features in general.\nWe test these ourselves, using specialist equipment as well as playing games consoles during the review process. We look for input lag of under 15ms to suit the majority of gamers, or under 10ms for those who want the absolute best results, and we make sure that the gaming features really do work as promised.\nToday's top TVs all have high-end gaming features built-in. Higher-end models, including many of the best OLED TVs, are usually excellent for gaming regardless of which one you choose, though some are slightly better value than others.

I love seeing all the latest TV releases as they come through our testing rooms, and I shape this guide by working with our reviewers and editors, to agree which TVs are the best fit for gaming, balancing features, sizes and price.\n14 July 2025\nSwapped the Samsung QN90D for the Samsung QN90F for best for bright rooms as the latter features and anti-reflection screen and higher brightness levels.\nThe best gaming TVs you can buy\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best gaming TV for most people\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want lots of size options: Whether gaming in the bedroom or in the living room, the LG C4 is available in 42- to 83-inch sizes to suit all environments.\n\u2705 You want a superb OLED TV for gaming: The C4 has a low 9.2ms input lag time plus stacks of gaming features such as 4K 144Hz, VRR, ALLM and Dolby Vision gaming, all on four HDMI 2.1 ports.\n\u274c You want the very brightest OLED: The Samsung S95D on this list provides a brighter OLED TV option with lower reflection levels.\n\u274cYou want the cheapest OLED for gaming: The LG B4, further down this list, is the cheapest gaming OLED TV available and still has most of the same features.\nThe LG C4 is an excellent all-around TV for gaming, movies, and just about anything else. It delivers exceptional gaming features and performance and a wide range of sizes that make it suitable for a wealth of environments \u2013 no other TV stands fully toe-to-toe with the C4 when it comes to gaming.\nLG\u2019s 2024 TVs including the C4 are the first models to be 144Hz-certified by Nvidia for G-Sync, which is great news for PC gamers (and it supports AMD FreeSync Premium, too). Xbox Series X and PS5 console owners will appreciate the C4\u2019s four HDMI 2.1 ports with 4K 120Hz support, along with variable refresh rate, and auto low latency mode. Cloud gaming is also well represented on the LG C4, with GeForce Now, Amazon Luna, Utomik, Blacknut, and Boosteroid apps available in the Games Quick Card on the TV\u2019s webOS 24 smart interface. We rated the LG C4's gaming features five out of five in our review, and with this much to offer, it's easy to see why.\nThe LG C4 also delivers spectacular picture quality. What impressed us most during our testing was the sheer level of detail in textures and the strength of the C4's contrast and its deep black levels. It also hit a peak brightness of 1,065 nits during our testing, a great number for a mid-range OLED that means HDR highlights look even more vibrant.\nWhile the LG C4's sound doesn't live up to the rest of its features (though is fine), the LG C4 offers incredible value for gamers by covering all the bases, delivering ultra-responsive performance while it's at it. While there may be faster, brighter gaming TVs, but none can match the C4 in terms of price versus performance, as well as sheer versatility and future-proofing\nRead the full LG C4 review\nBest gaming TV for PS5\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You own a PS5: The Sony Bravia 8 has 'Perfect for PS5' gaming features including an auto HDR tone mapping mode that activates when a PS5 is connected.\n\u2705 You want great built-in sound for your games: With accurate sound placement, impressive dynamics and clear speech, the Bravia 8 has one of the best built-in sound systems in the TV market.\n\u274c You want the fastest gaming TV: Although the Bravia 8's 12.8ms input lag time is decent, there are entries on this list that beat it.\n\u274cYou need multiple HDMI 2.1 ports: The Bravia 8 only comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports so those with multiple gaming consoles plus a soundbar should take note.\nThe Sony Bravia 8 is Sony's only new OLED for 2024, with the brand opting for mini-LED in its flagship Bravia 9 model instead. Although only offering some incremental upgrades over its predecessor, the Sony A80L, it still serves as the best option for PS5 owners thanks to its PS5-centric features.\nThe Bravia 8 comes with 'Perfect for PS5' features built-in, including a HDR tone mapping mode that activates when a PS5 is connected to tune highlights and shadows for the exact capabilities of this TV, so you better visibility in the brightest and darkest areas. It also supports 4K 120Hz, VRR and ALLM. It has an improved 12.8ms input lag time compared with the 16.5ms its predecessor produced (which is better than the lag we measured in our Sony Bravia 9 review too, despite that being the higher-end model).\nBut it's not just features where the Bravia 8 is a solid option. We were impressed by the Bravia 8's picture for gaming, noting how good its backlight control was and we said that when playing Marvel's Spider-Man 2 \"Spidey\u2019s suit and buildings exhibit clear shine where they\u2019re being hit by sunlight\". The Bravia 8's improved HDR brightness also helped give images a more vivid look.\nSpeaking of pictures, the Bravia 8 is also a fantastic companion for movies. The rich colors and pixel-perfect contrast give everything a dynamic pop on screen, adding an extra layer of vibrancy. Black levels are also superb, with dark details taking on a refined quality.\nThe Bravia 8 also delivers with its built-in sound, with plenty of immersion, accurate placement and an engaging feel. While its gaming features and performance may not be the best on the list, the Bravia 8 is still an excellent gaming option.\nRead our full Sony Bravia 8 review\nThe best budget gaming TV in the US\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a budget TV for gaming: The Hisense U7N is well equipped for gaming for its affordable price, with 4K 144Hz, VRR, ALLM and Dolby Vision gaming all featured.\n\u2705 You want a TV that has a good picture for the money: The U7N's picture has great contrast, vibrant color and fine detail \u2013 it's sure to make graphics look good.\n\u274c You want the best picture: While it's picture is very good for the price, the U7N does suffer from backlight blooming and limited viewing angles.\n\u274cYou want immersive built-in sound: The U7N's sound is fine, thought it does feel narrow and lacks a real sense of immersion.\nThe Hisense U7N's stacked suite of gaming features is ideal for PS5 and Xbox Series X owners and it has a great quality mini-LED picture, all for significantly less than the other TVs on this list.\nWith 4K 120Hz (with 144Hz option), Dolby Vision gaming, VRR including AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-sync, ALLM and a Game Bar menu, the U7N has a near-complete list of gaming features you'd expect to find on more premium gaming TVs.\nThe U7N's picture has bright, bold colors but with no sacrifice of contrast and black levels, which is an impressive accomplishment for a budget mini-LED TV. Textures and details are refined and accurate, giving the picture plenty of depth. The U7N suffers from some backlight blooming and its contrast fades when viewed off-axis, but overall the U7N's picture is great and adds an extra layer to gaming.\nSadly, the U7N's sound quality doesn't quite match its picture, but its directional sound, solid bass, and clear dialogue will suit a lot of games, as we discovered testing with Battlefield V. Ultimately though, its narrow soundstage means a soundbar may be required.\nBang for your buck is at the core of the U7N. With prices sitting roughly at $800 for a 65-inch screen size, it is hard to argue against the performance and features it delivers for the price.\nRead our full Hisense U7N review\nThe best budget gaming TV in the UK\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a TV that feels more premium than its price: The Samsung Q80D delivers in a lot of areas and feels far more premium than its price suggests.\n\u2705 You want a mid-range TV with a lot of gaming features: The Q80D has four HDMI 2.1 ports which support 4K 120Hz, VRR and ALLM and it also features Samsung's useful gaming hub.\n\u274c You don't want to adjust settings: To get the Q80D's very best picture quality we found that we had to make adjustments in the settings, particularly for color.\n\u274cYou want the very best gaming TV: While the Q80D is a superb gaming TV, it doesn't quite hit all the highs like the LG C4, which sits at the top of this list.\nThe Samsung Q80D proves that you don't need to spend a fortune to get a comprehensive TV as it delivers a bright, colorful picture, a brilliant stock of gaming features and surprisingly good sound \u2013 all for less than you'd expect. Combine all that into one package and you get an excellent, affordable gaming TV.\nThe Q80D is equipped with four HDMI 2.1 ports, all of which support 4K,120Hz, VRR (including both HDMI and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro varieties) and ALLM. Thankfully, the Q80D backs up these features with performance, with an ultra low 9.8ms input lag time that we described in our review as \"exhilaratingly responsive\".\nBut, it's not just gaming performance where the Q80D triumphs, as it delivers a dynamic, colorful picture that's superb for both games and movies. We noted in our review that it offers surprisingly rich black levels and contrast better \"than any other LCD TV I can think of in its class\". It also displays textures in a sharp, yet natural style that gives pictures a lifelike quality. The Q80D's colors are also top-notch once you've done some setup.\nSound can often be hit-or-miss with TVs, especially more budget models, but this isn't true for the Q80D. It won't dethrone the best TVs for sound, but the Q80D's built-in sound is impressive for its price range. It has a large soundstage, excellent sound placement and great Atmos staging \u2013 plus good bass levels and clear speech. Sound also extends beyond the screen, giving you an even better sense of immersion.\nThe Q80D carries the triple threat of picture, features and performance that make a great gaming TV. It's easily the stand-out gaming TV in its price range.\nRead our full Samsung Q80D review\nThe best gaming TV for lighter rooms\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a TV for daytime gaming: The Samsung QN90F's high brightness and Glare Free anti-reflection screen make it perfect for gaming in bright rooms.\n\u2705 You want a vibrant, detailed picture: With its great contrast, vibrant colours and refined detail, the QN90F is perfect for current-gen gaming.\n\u274c You want the best value gaming TV: The QN90F is excellent, but the Hisense U7N and Samsung Q80D are arguably better value when it comes to price vs performance.\n\u274cYou want the very best TV for gaming: The QN90F is a great TV, but the LG C4 at the top of this list is still the best overall TV for gaming.\nDaytime gaming can be a challenge, but the Samsung QN90F's high brightness, reflection-beating Glare Free screen and vibrant colours make gaming in a bright room easy.\nWith four HDMI 2.1 ports supporting 4K 165Hz, VRR (AMD FreeSync Premium Pro), HGiG, ALLM and HDR10+ gaming, the QN90F is well equipped for current-gen consoles. It also has an ultra-low 9.5ms input lag time for impressively slick performance and features Samsung's Gaming Hub, which serves as a portal for all things gaming, including access to plenty of apps such as Xbox.\nThe QN90F's picture holds up well in well-lit rooms thanks to its high peak brightness (2,087 nits) and fullscreen brightness (667 nits) and effective Glare Free screen. It also delivers realistic details and textures and stunning contrast, with deep black levels.\nWhile the QN90F may be one of the pricier TVs on this list, it delivers across the board for both gaming and picture quality. If you find your room is too bright for a standard TV, the QN90F could be the answer.\nRead our full Samsung QN90F review\nThe cheapest gaming OLED TV\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an affordable OLED for gaming: The LG B4 is the cheapest way to get a 2024 OLED TV \u2013 and you'll still get great picture quality and features.\n\u2705 You want a well-featured OLED for gaming: The B4 comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports with 4K 120Hz , ALLM and VRR support at a more affordable price than other OLED TVs.\n\u274c You want the best built-in sound: The B4's speakers are adequate, but you won't get the same sound quality you'd find in the Sony Bravia 8 or most Samsung models on this list.\n\u274cYou like a bright picture: Compared to all other TVs on this list, the LG B4 has limited brightness, topping out at just over 650 nits.\nOLED gaming doesn't have to be expensive, and this is proven by the LG B4 \u2013 the cheapest 2024 OLED TV you can buy. Despite its cheaper price, the B4 comes with plenty of features and a punchy performance that will keep gamers happy, especially with the introduction of its new features. The B4 is also available in a 48-inch size for the first time, perfect for gaming in bedrooms or smaller living rooms.\nThe B4 carries an improved list of gaming features over its predecessor, the LG B3, with four HDMI 2.1 ports for the first time. All of these ports support 4K 120Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, VRR (AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync accounted for), HGiG and ALLM. It also delivers an ultra-low 9.2ms input lag time when Boost mode is activated in the Game Optimizer menu.\nIn our review of the B4, we were impressed not only by its gaming chops, calling it \"an excellent gaming TV for price\" but also by its picture quality. We found that the Dolby Vision Filmmaker Mode provided accurate presentation of color and contrast when watching Godzilla Minus One and also delivered excellent black levels throughout viewing. We were even impressed with its upscaling of non-4K sources, describing these images as \"crisp with great detail.\"\nIt's not all perfect for the B4, as its lower brightness pales compared to most of the other TVs here, and its built-in sound is average, but if you're looking for a way to introduce OLED to your TV gaming setup and are on a budget, the B4 is your best choice.\nRead our full LG B4 review\nThe best OLED gaming TV for brightness\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a super-bright OLED: With a 'four-stack' panel that hits new brightness highs for OLED, the G5 is perfect for gaming.\n\u2705 You want a TV with every gaming feature: The G5 is fully equipped for gaming, with 4K 165Hz, VRR, ALLM and Dolby Vision gaming all supported.\n\u274c You want the best value OLED: While it is a fantastic TV, the G5 is significantly pricier than LG's C-series OLEDs, which carry as many features for less.\n\u274cYou want HDR10+ support: HDR10+ gaming may be a new thing, but the G5 doesn't support HDR10+ in any capacity.\nThe LG G5 features LG's latest OLED panel tech: the Primary Tandem RGB OLED (or four-stack). This panel delivers stunningly high brightness levels for OLED (the brightest we've measured so far) and when combined with the G5's full array of gaming features, it's the ideal TV for those who want OLED gaming in bright rooms.\nEquipped with four HDMI 2.1 ports, the G5 supports 4K 165Hz, VRR (incluidng AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia GSync formats) Dolby Vision gaming and ALLM, meaning it covers every base. Combine this with its ultra-responsive performance (and low 9.1ms input lag time) and you get a superb OLED for gaming.\nWe measured the G5's peak brightness at 2,268 nits and fullscreen brightness at 331 nits (both in Filmmaker Mode), making it the brightest OLED we've tested so far. Its high brightness lets it be used in brighter viewing environments while maintaining accurate color, black levels and contrast.\nThe flagship G5 is undoubtedly a pricey, premium OLED TV. While there are better-priced mid-range options, such as the LG C4 at the top of this list, when it comes to bright room gaming, there aren't any better OLED TVs than the G5.\nThe best elite gaming TV for PS5\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a unique mini-LED TV: While its brightness and contrast are similar to other mini-LED TVs, it's the Bravia 9's OLED-level blacks that make it stand out in the mini-LED market.\n\u2705 You want a premium PS5 experience: The Bravia 9's superb picture quality and Perfect for PS5 gaming features combine to make it the ultimate TV for your PS5.\n\u274c You want the most responsive gaming TV: The Bravia 9's 17ms input lag time is the highest of any TV on our list and falls just short of the 15ms that professional gamers look for.\n\u274cYou are on a budget: The Bravia 9's picture and performance come at a price that is even higher than many premium OLEDs.\nThe Sony Bravia 9 uses Sony's XR Backlight Master Drive with High Peak Luminance, which is a new twist on mini-LED tech that encompasses custom 22-bit LED drivers to offer significantly more refined local dimming, meaning best-in-class contrast for a mini-LED, and it's a fantastic improvement to pictures for both movies and gaming.\nThe Bravia 9 features PS5-exclusive features including Auto HDR Tone Mapping and Auto Genre Picture Mode when it detects a PS5, displaying the best picture possible. It also comes with 4K 120Hz, VRR (including Nvidia GSync but sadly not AMD FreeSync), Dolby Vision gaming and a Game Bar to make easy settings adjustments while gaming. While we did measure a higher-than-expected 17ms input lag time (most premium sets around this price have been sub-10ms), combining the Bravia 9's features with its picture quality makes for an excellent gaming experience as long as you're not a literal pro gamer.\nSpeaking of picture quality, the Bravia 9's is simply stunning. The sophisticated mini-LED tech means OLED-level blacks with rich contrast and exceptional brightness - 2,280 nits in standard mode in fact - that will be perfect for daytime viewing. Crucially, there's also little-to-no light bleed in high contrast images, something that is a regular issue for other mini-LED TVs.\nIn terms of built-in audio quality, the Bravia 9 follows in a long line of Sony sets that prioritize sound as well as picture. Acoustic Multi Audio+ creates an excellent sense of space and immersion and Voice Zoom 3 boosts dialogue levels during intense scenes. There's also even more unlocked when the Bravia 9 is paired with a Sony soundbar, including Acosutic Center Sync (using the Bravia 9's speakers as a bonus center channel) and 360 spatial audio mapping (creating phantom speakers for even more sound).\nThe Bravia 9 is undoubtedly pricey and is available in more limited sizes in the UK (75 and 85-inch only) but for those looking to go big with their gaming (especially PS5 owners), this is one of the best premium options you can get.\nRead our full Sony Bravia 9 review\nThe best cheap gaming TV\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a cheap gaming TV: The Hisense U6N has a good stock of gaming features and delivers good gaming performance for a budget-friendly price.\n\u2705 You want a cheap mini-LED TV: The U6N is one of the most affordable ways to get a mini-LED TV, giving you more dynamic pictures than standard LCD sets.\n\u274c You want a full suite of gaming features: While the U6N is well stocked, there is no 120Hz support included; look to the Hisense U7N or Samsung Q80D as the cheapest way to get this.\n\u274cYou don't want to use a soundbar: The U6N's sound will be suitable for casual viewing, but we'd recommend a soundbar for those looking for a more immersive experience.\nThe Hisense U6N may not have all the bells and whistles of the other gaming TVs on this list, but it does have a good stock of features and delivers solid performance, especially for its budget-friendly price.\nDespite no 120Hz support, the U6N offers 4K 60Hz, VRR (AMD FreeSync, Nvidia G-Sync and HDMI Forum), ALLM and Dolby Vision gaming. it also has a solid 13.2ms input lag time for smooth performance at 60fps.\nIn our Hisense U6N review, we were impressed not only by the U6N's gaming performance but also by its picture quality. While not as refined as more premium sets, the U6N still delivers good detail, solid contrast and punchy, natural colors that are better than its budget price would suggest.\nThe U6N however will require some tweaking in the settings and we'd recommend adding a soundbar for anything more than casual viewing. But, if you're looking for a cheap TV to play games at 60fps, then it's hard to argue against what the U6N offers.\nRead our full Hisense U6N review\nHow to choose the best gaming TV\nHow to choose the best gaming TV\nThere are a few key things to consider when you're choosing the best gaming TV for you.\nGame Mode and low latency: Latency is the time between when an image is sent by the console and when it actually shows up on the screen. Modern TVs do a lot of clever processing to images to make them look better, but this takes time, which means there's a delay between you pressing a button on a controller and seeing the result \u2013 that's not ideal in a fast-paced game. All TVs now have a Game Mode, or something with a similar name, which reduces the processing, meaning lower latency.\nHDMI 2.1: The latest and greatest HDMI connector tech, which includes support for ALLM, 4K 120Hz, and VRR.\nALLM: Auto Low Latency Mode is a newer feature where consoles can tell the TV to switch into Game Mode automatically \u2013 you won't have to set it with a remote.\n4K 120Hz: This means a TV can refresh its screen up to 120 times per second, while still displaying at 4K resolution. Cheaper TVs are more likely to refresh at 60 times per second. You may also find some mid-range 4K TVs that refresh at 120Hz, but don't include HDMI 2.1, so they can only show Full HD resolution at 120Hz, or 4K at 60Hz.\nVRR: Variable Refresh Rate is a feature that means the TV will synchonize the speed at which is refreshes the screen with whatever the current framerate of your game is. This means games don't have to stay locked to 30, 60 or 120fps to avoid screen tearing, which means they can offering better graphics. There are three types of VRR: HDMI forum; FreeSync and G-Sync.\nHDMI forum VRR: This is supported by both the PS5 and Xbox Series X, and is an official part of the HDMI 2.1 spec. Most TVs with HDMI 2.1 support it.\nAMD FreeSync: This is supported by the Xbox Series X and AMD graphics cards on PC. It's pretty common to find on TVs, including on some without HDMI 2.1.\nNvidia G-Sync: This is supported by Nvidia graphics cards on PC, but not by consoles. It's pretty rare to find on TVs, too, but it does happen.\nWhat features on gaming TVs are relevant to PS5 and Xbox Series X?\nWhether you own a PS5 or Xbox Series X could impact the gaming TV you choose, especially if you're looking to get the most from your console. Certain TVs on this list are better suited to certain consoles.\nWhile both consoles support 4K 120Hz, VRR, and other gaming features, the Xbox Series X supports Dolby Vision gaming, while the PS5 does not. But, if you have an Xbox Series X, you won't be able to take advantage of Dolby Vision gaming if you opt for a Samsung TV as Samsung TVs don't support Dolby Vision.\nElsewhere, Sony's range of TVs, including the Sony Bravia 8 OLED and Sony Bravia 9 mini-LED, carry PS5-specific features (as Sony also makes the PS5), including an Auto HDR Tone Mapping feature that automatically enhances the picture when a PS5 is detected on a compatible Sony TV.\nGenerally, you'll still get a lot from your console regardless of what TV you buy from this list, but the above features are worth noting if you're looking to get that little bit extra.\nIs a TV good for PC gaming?\nWe've established that gaming TVs are fantastic companions for your games consoles, but what if you play on PC? There's certainly an appeal in playing graphically intensive PC games on a big screen, but how does that play out in practice?\nWhile a gaming TV can certainly substitute for a PC gaming monitor, you'll need to make sure your PC can handle the resolution. 4K screens are naturally more taxing on your PC's resources due to them offering much higher image quality.\nIf your PC is up to scratch, you'll get a smooth experience at 4K on a bigger screen. If not, you may have to switch your game to a lower resolution like 1440p or 1080p, in which case your gaming TV might not be able to handle the upscaling needed very well. This will result in a blurrier than intended image thanks to the size of the TV compared to a monitor.\nIt's a double-edged sword, then, and almost entirely dependant on how powerful your PC is. If you've got the high-end parts to make it happen, then PC gaming on a TV can produce wonderful results. If it's not quite there, then you're better off playing on a smaller monitor able to output a sharper, cleaner image.\nHow much is a gaming TV?\nTVs suited for gaming vary wildly in price, depending on a wide number of factors. 4K TVs are incredibly common these days, and can be bought for as little as $300 / \u00a3300 / AU$450. Of course, you're getting very basic features with a TV at this price, with a size of around 43 inches, and almost certainly lacking 4K 120Hz support, and variable refresh rates.\nBut these features can be found on TVs that aren't too expensive, often available for under $800 / \u00a3900 / AU$1,200 in smaller sizes. If you want gaming feature for next-gen consoles, you need to assume you'll pay something starting in that region.\nDo I need an 8K gaming TV?\nThe short answer? No.\nWhile 8K games are absolutely on the horizon, and the PS5 / Xbox Series X console come with this capability baked-in, there's no immediate need to get an 8K TV for gaming. Gaming devs are still getting to grips with 4K performance, and in general other picture specifications like a high frame rate (60fps, 120fps) are going to be more important in the coming years.\nIn 2025, maybe it'll be a different answer, but for now we think the 4K gaming TVs listed above will do you just fine.\nNew gaming TVs for 2025\nAt CES 2025, several brands revealed their TV lineups for 2025 and among them were a few TVs that could make their way onto this list, either alongside or replacing their predecessors.\nFrom Samsung, we have the Samsung S95F, its flagship 2025 OLED and predecessor to the Samsung S95D. It carries improved gaming features including 165Hz refresh rate for PC gaming, but it's the improved, second-generation OLED Glare Free tech we're excited about. We loved OLED Glare Free (an anti-reflection screen) on the S95D as it effectively eliminated reflections in bright viewing environments and from what we've seen of the second-gen version on the S95F, it's just as effective and maintains more accurate black levels.\nAlso from Samsung is the Samsung QN90F, the successor to the best TV for bright rooms on this list, the Samsung QN90D. The QN90F will also have a Glare Free screen and we're expecting a brightness increase, which will hopefully make the QN90F even better than its predecessor for gaming in bright environments.\nPanasonic revealed the Panasonic Z95B, its 2025 flagship OLED, which will come stocked with a near-full suite of gaming features. It also uses a four-stack OLED panel and from what we've seen, its picture is seriously impressive. If its sound quality is anything like its predecessor, the Panasonic Z95A, the Z95B could be an excellent all-rounder.\nWe've yet to hear about new gaming TVs from Hisense, Sony, Philips and TCL, and we're still waiting for more details on the LG B5 OLED, but we expect there'll be other competitive TVs to follow in the footsteps of the Hisense U8N, Sony Bravia 8, Philips OLED809 and OLED909 and more in 2025.\nHow we test the best gaming TVs\nWhen we test the best gaming TVs, we\u2019re mainly looking at gaming performance and related features that enhance gaming. For these tests, we apply the same criteria used in our reviews such as picture and audio quality based on objective and subjective tests.\nFor gaming TVs, we use a gaming console (mainly an Xbox Series X although this can vary based on the reviewer) to test motion performance with graphics, analyzing latency and response time. We put the TV in its Game Mode during these tests to keep it consistent across each model and to maximize the gaming experience.\nWe also look for features such as VRR and 120Hz refresh rate to test their effectiveness. Not all the best gaming TVs have to provide these features, but it\u2019s something we take into consideration during testing. To test latency added by the TV\u2019s processing, we use a Leo Bodnar 4K HDMI Input Lag tester, with that measurement taken in the set\u2019s Game Mode.\nWe also test picture quality with movies and TV shows, cycling through preset picture modes such as Standard and Movie to determine which is the most accurate. We\u2019ll then play a variety of sources including 4K Blu-ray, 4K and HD streaming, and lower-res formats such as broadcast TV and DVD to evaluate the TV\u2019s upscaling.\nAnother important area we test is how well a gaming TV handles dark tones, looking particularly at black uniformity (the ability to evenly display black across the screen) and its overall contrast.\nWe use specialized equipment, including a test pattern generator and colorimeter, to take measurements for our objective tests, with the results recorded in Portrait Displays\u2019 Calman calibration software.\nTo test a TV\u2019s overall brightness, we use various-sized white windows, including 10% and 100%. A 10% window provides a standardized indication of the peak brightness that can be expected, whereas 100% shows how consistently it can display a bright image such as a colorful video game. These tests also determine how a TV handles screen reflections, which is crucial for daytime gaming.\nThe color reproduction tests we make with both HDR and SDR sources are important to see how faithfully and accurately a TV can display source material, and they also indicate the maximum color gamut available. We additionally test for grayscale accuracy, looking at how consistently a TV tracks gray tones on the screen from black to white.\nWe aim to keep conditions consistent across our tests, but it\u2019s worth noting that some writer setups do vary. We always strive, however, to use equivalent equipment and procedures so our results are comparable across TVs.\nYou can read more in-depth about how we test TVs at TechRadar at that link, and in particular for this guide, how we test TV input lag.\nOther TVs we've tested\nLG C5: Packed with a full list of gaming features and with superb gaming performance, the LG C5 is an excellent, mid-range OLED gaming TV. It also has superb picture quality and an easy-to-use smart TV platform, earning it five stars in our LG C5 review. However, it is significantly pricier than its predecessor the LG C4 for a minimal upgrade, so it misses out on the list for now. Once the C4 disappears however, expect the C5 to take its place.\nSamsung S95D: With a near-full list of gaming features, excellent picture quality with effective anti-reflection tech and a premium, slim design, the Samsung S95D is an awesome TV, earning five-stars in our Samsung S95D review. However, with its superior brightness levels, the LG G5 takes the title of best OLED for gaming in bright rooms.\nHisense U8N: A super-bright, feature-packed mini-LED TV, the Hisense U8N comes with a good stock of gaming features at an affordable price (though it's better priced in the US than anywhere else). While it is a superb TV, the Samsung Q80D and Hisense U7N are cheaper, and have a great list of gaming features in their own right. But, as you can read in our Hisense U8N review, it's still a fantastic TV.\nLG G4: The LG G4 is a premium OLED TV that delivers a premium gaming experience with a full stock of features across four HDMI 2.1 ports. Its MLA OLED panel means it delivers phenomenal brightness for an OLED, and its detail, contrast and color are incredible, too. While it's a superb TV, we preferred the Samsung S95D overall as the best TV for 'Super-bright OLED' as it delivers not only higher peak and fullscreen brightness, but its OLED Glare Free screen makes it perfect for daytime gaming. However, if you want Dolby Vision gaming support, read our LG G4 review, because the G4 carries that feature.\nLoad the next products...\nTCL QM851G: The TCL has spectacular brightness levels that make it a great option for brighter room gaming, but the Samsung QN90D is our choice due to its superior processing and wider range of size options (the QM851G starts at 65-inch). Make no mistake, as our TCL QM851G review says, this TV still delivers excellent picture quality, sound and a good number of gaming features so is still one for consideration. (Note that this is a US-only TV \u2013 the closest UK/Europe equivalent is the TCL C855)\nPhilips OLED809/OLED909: Philips' OLED TVs strongest weapon and most unique factor is their Ambilight feature, a series of lights around the TV that project colors onto the wall behind. This adds a truly unique layer to gaming that make things feel even bigger and more immersive, plus both sets are stacked with gaming features and deliver amazing picture quality and sound. Unfortunately, they're only available in the UK and they don't quite offer the same value and performance ratio that the LG C4 does, especially because they only have two HDMI 2.1 ports each. However, read our Philips OLED809 review and our Philips OLED909 review if you like the idea of a TV that feels much bigger than it is.\nPanasonic Z95A: The Panasonic Z95A is a fantastic flagship OLED TV that not only delivers exceptional picture quality, but unparalleled sound that's immersive and expansive. It also makes for a great gaming TV with 4K 144Hz, VRR and Dolby Vision gaming. But, it doesn't quite match up the Samsung S95D or LG C4 in terms of OLED gaming performance and value \u2013 again, especially because it has only two HDMI 2.1 ports. But that sound may make up for it, as our Panasonic Z95A review digs into.\nAmazon Fire TV Omni QLED: A budget-friendly, QLED TV, the Amazon Omni QLED carries a decent amount of gaming features, incluidng VRR, ALLM and Dolby Vision gaming support and while it may be limited to 4K, 60Hz, we found in our Amazon Omni QLED review that \"gaming performance is surprisingly good for a cheaper TV\" and that its picture quality is colorful, natural and detailed for the price. While it is a good budget TV, the Hisense U6N takes its spot on the list as it offers mini-LED and more gaming features for only a fractional amount more.\nTCL C855: A UK-specific model, the TCL C855 is an excellent mini-LED TV that has a great stock of gaming features, including 4K, 120Hz, VRR, ALLM and Dolby Vision gaming all included. It also delivers effective local dimming that results in superb contrast and black levels as well as bright and colorful picture quality. It doesn't quite make the list as the Samsung Q80d offers a more complete gaming experience, but find out more about this brilliant TV in our TCL C855 review.\nHisense 110UX: A big screen gaming experience like no other, the massive 110-inch Hisense UX has a solid list of gaming features and the performance to match. It also has great picture quality and a decent sound system, as we discovered in our Hisense 110UX review. You'll just first have to get over the shock of its price ($15,000!).\nPanasonic Z85A: A mid-range OLED with much to offer, the Z85A's good list of gaming features matches up to other rival OLEDs, as we noted in our Panasonic Z85A review. The Z85A has a detailed picture with powerful contrast, but it is pricier than rival OLEDs such as the LG B4 and LG C4.\nThe latest updates to this best gaming TVs guide\n14 July 2025\nSwapped the Samsung QN90D for the Samsung QN90F for best for bright rooms as the latter features and anti-reflection screen and higher brightness levels.\n6 May 2025\nSwapped the Samsung S95D for the LG G5 as 'best super-bright OLED' for the latter's superior brightness levels.\n10 March 2025\nAdded in a gallery of images for each entry on this list.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nSony\u2019s new OLED TV offers better brightness than its predecessor, and its impressive overall picture quality allows it to compete well against its flagship OLED competitors. The built-in sound is a clear notch above what you get on most other TVs, even some pricey ones, and Sony\u2019s elegant design means the TV looks good even when turned off. Although its picture is great out of the box, the Bravia 8 II\u2019s wide-ranging adjustments let tweakers dial it in to perfection. Gaming features aren\u2019t as extensive as what you get on other flagship TVs, but that\u2019s really the only important area where the Bravia 8 II comes up short against its competition.\nPros\n- +\nImpressive brightness overall\n- +\nNatural, yet vivid color\n- +\nGreat built-in sound and audio features\nCons\n- -\nOnly two HDMI 2.1 ports\n- -\nPricey\n- -\nNot as bright as LG G5 or Samsung S95F\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nSony Bravia 8 II: Two-minute review\nThe Sony Bravia 8 II is the company\u2019s flagship OLED TV for 2025. Whereas its Sony Bravia 8 predecessor used a mid-range W-OLED display panel, the Bravia 8 II uses a QD-OLED panel, the same type found in the Samsung S95F.\nAdding QD-OLED to the Sony Bravia 8 II mix has resulted in a TV with a notably brighter picture than the Bravia 8. It also improved color gamut coverage, with colors looking consistently rich, yet accurate on the Bravia 8 II. The TV\u2019s effective anti-reflective screen lets it carry over those picture quality benefits for bright-room viewing, though the Bravia 8 II\u2019s detailed, refined picture is best appreciated when you dim the lights.\nOn most of the best TVs, the Bravia 8 II\u2019s slim design might indicate potentially anemic audio \u2013you need to put decent-sized speakers somewhere to get good sound, and slim TV frames don't accommodate that. But Sony provides an ingenious workaround with its Acoustic Surface Audio+ feature, which positions actuators behind the TV\u2019s QD-OLED panel that turn the entire screen into a speaker. As a result, the Bravia 8 II provides relatively full and robust sound for a TV, and its Acoustic Center Sync feature also lets you use it as a dedicated center channel with a compatible Sony soundbar or speaker system.\nGoogle TV is used as the Bravia 8 II\u2019s smart TV platform, and it's an easy-to-navigate system. A built-in mic lets you control the TV using Google Voice Command, and you can also control it using a mic button on the remote or with Alexa speakers if you\u2019re part of the Alexa ecosystem.\nPlayStation 5 users unsurprisingly enjoy gaming benefits on the Bravia 8 II, which automatically switches to a preset Game mode and engages auto HDR tone mapping when a connected PS5 console is turned on. The TV also supports 4K 120Hz input, but with only two HDMI 2.1 ports, gamers looking to also connect both an Xbox Series X console plus one of the best soundbars will be disappointed.\nThe Bravia 8 II is undoubtedly one of the best OLED TVs to be released in 2025, but it has stiff competition from flagship OLEDs such as the Samsung S95F and LG G5, both of which are brighter and more feature-packed. All three sets are currently priced around the same, making the Bravia 8 II a bit of a tough value call, but its charms are many, and its great overall picture and sound quality let it effectively compete with other flagship TVs.\nSony Bravia 8 II review: Price and release date\n- Release date: April 2025\n- 55-inch: $2,999 / \u00a32,499 / AU$3,999\n- 65-inch: $3,499 / \u00a32,999 / AU$4,999\nUnlike its Bravia 8 OLED TV predecessor, which was available in 55-, 65-, and 77-inch screen sizes, the Bravia 8 II is limited to 55- and 65-inch models (though the older Sony A95L TV is being kept around in a 77-inch model only, in case you want a larger option).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nSince its April unveiling, prices for both sizes have dropped in the US and Australia, with the 55-inch now priced at $3,299 / AU$2,999 and the 65-inch at $2,999 / AU$3,999.\nThe Bravia 8 II\u2019s reduced price more closely aligns it with other flagship OLED TVs such as the Samsung S95F ($3,399 / \u00a33,399 / AU$5,295 at launch) and LG G5 ($3,399 / \u00a33,299 / AU$5,299 at launch). Both those models have also seen early discounts in the US, with the S95F dropping as low as $3,099 and the G5 to $3,199.\nSony Bravia 8 II review: Specs\nScreen type: | QD-OLED |\nRefresh rate: | 120Hz |\nHDR support: | Dolby Vision, HDR10, HLG |\nAudio support: | Dolby Atmos, DTS:X |\nSmart TV: | Google TV |\nHDMI ports: | 4 (2x HDMI 2.1) |\nBuilt-in tuner: | ATSC 3.0 (US) |\nSony Bravia 8 II review: Benchmark results\nSony Bravia 8 II review: Features\n- QD-OLED display panel with strong anti-reflection layer\n- Acoustic Surface Audio+ sound\n- Perfect for PlayStation 5 gaming tech, but limited other features\nThe Sony Bravia 8 II features a QD-OLED display panel \u2013 an upgrade over the standard W-OLED panel used by its Bravia 8 predecessor. It also uses Sony\u2019s XR Processor, which provides AI-based scene recognition to enhance pictures, along with a bunch of picture processing features that come under the XR umbrella, such as Contrast Booster, Clear Image, and OLED Motion. The Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HLG high dynamic range formats are supported, but not HDR10+.\nA glossy screen with an anti-reflective coating helps to reduce screen glare from indoor light sources on the Bravia 8 II. There\u2019s no Filmmaker Mode, but a range of custom presets, including IMAX Enhanced, Netflix Adaptive Calibrated Mode, and Prime Video Calibrated Mode, are available to optimize pictures for movies, TV shows, and sports.\nSony TVs regularly rank among the best TVs for sound, and the Bravia 8 II provides a range of features that help distinguish it from other TVs when it comes to audio performance. The main one is Acoustic Surface Audio+, which positions actuators behind the TV that turn the entire screen area into a speaker.\nThere\u2019s also Acoustic Center Sync, a feature that accepts an audio input from a compatible Sony soundbar or speakers so the TV's built-in audio system can be used as a center-channel speaker.\nSony\u2019s 3D Surround Upscaling does exactly what its name implies by boosting two-channel and 5.1-channel soundtracks to an immersive audio presentation, while Voice Zoom 3 uses AI to recognize voices in soundtracks and give them an extra volume boost. Both the Dolby Atmos and DTS:X immersive audio formats are supported by the Bravia 8 II.\nSony TVs use the Google TV smart TV platform, and the Bravia 8 II has a built-in mic that lets you use Google Assistant for voice commands. A mic button on the TV\u2019s remote control can also be used for voice commands, which has the benefit of not having to leave the TV\u2019s microphone perpetually on (there\u2019s a mic on-off switch on the TV\u2019s input panel).\nYou can wirelessly stream content to the Bravia 8 II using Google Cast and AirPlay. And if you\u2019re part of the Alexa universe, with Alexa speakers in your home, you can also control the TV using Alexa voice commands.\nThe Bravia 8 II\u2019s gaming features include support for 4K at 120Hz, variable refresh rate, auto low-latency mode, and Dolby Vision gaming. It also has a new Gaming Menu 2 for making gaming-related adjustments, and is \u201cPerfect for PlayStation 5,\u201d with an auto HDR tone mapping and auto genre mode features kicking in when a PS5 console is connected.\nUnlike the best gaming TVs, which typically provide four HDMI 2.1 inputs, the Bravia 8 II\u2019s HDMI 2.1 input count is limited to two ports out of its four HDMI ports in total.\n- Features Score: 4.5 / 5\nSony Bravia 8 II review: Picture quality\n- Good brightness for an OLED TV\n- Inky, detailed shadows and black tones\n- Rich, yet natural color\nWhen we tested the Sony Bravia 8 in 2024, it yielded only average HDR brightness levels, topping out at 817 nits peak and 182 nits fullscreen brightness in the Standard picture mode.\nThe new model\u2019s QD-OLED panel pushes peak HDR brightness levels substantially higher, with the Bravia 8 II measuring 1,439 and 1,067 nits in Cinema and Standard modes, respectively. Fullscreen brightness, on the other hand, is only slightly higher, with the Bravia 8 II measuring 183 nits in Cinema mode and 250 nits in Standard mode.\nThe Bravia 8 II\u2019s brightness results, while an impressive leap over last year\u2019s model, still fall short compared to other 2025 flagship OLED TVs we\u2019ve tested, such as the LG G5 and Samsung S95F, both of which reach well into the 2,000 nits of peak brightness range, and over 350 nits of fullscreen brightness.\nThat\u2019s not to say that the Bravia 8 II isn\u2019t sufficiently bright; its picture just doesn\u2019t stand up equally well in bright room lighting conditions as those two TVs.\nI measured the Bravia 8 II\u2019s coverage of the UHDA-P3 and BT.2020 color spaces in Cinema mode at 99.9% and 87.5%, respectively. Those are both excellent results and are similar to what we measured on the Samsung S95F.\nColor point accuracy in the same mode averaged a 2.6 Delta-E value (which is the margin of error between the test pattern source and what\u2019s shown on-screen, with a result lower than 3.0 being undetectable by the human eye). In contrast, Cinema mode grayscale accuracy was 5.4 \u2013 a less impressive result.\nViewed in dimmed lighting conditions, a 4K Dolby Vision stream of the movie Civil War looked impressively punchy, with the bright highlights from spotlights and bonfires in a nighttime encampment scene contrasting well with the black night sky. Shadow detail was also strong, and the multiple adjustments in the TV\u2019s picture Brightness submenu could be used to fine-tune black levels to bring out even more detail.\nI had the same impression when I watched another movie, Alien: Romulus, in 4K Dolby Vision. Blacks in the ship\u2019s shadowy chambers looked inky and deep, and the colored lights of the control panels popped with a high level of brightness.\nThese and other reference movies I watched with my room's overhead lights turned on lost some of their contrast punch, but black levels remained mostly consistent. The TV\u2019s anti-reflection screen also did a good job of eliminating glare, though lamps positioned across from the TV were reflected in a mirror-like manner.\nThe Bravia 8 II does an excellent job upscaling older movies and TV shows. Streaming an episode of the detective show Columbo from the 1980s, the picture looked impressively solid and clean, and I could even make out textures in the mullet haircuts of guests in a wedding scene.\nColors in both older and more recent movies looked consistently natural, and the Sony was able to show accurate skin tones while also vividly rendering brightly colored objects, such as a magenta flower bush and a yellow children\u2019s toy, in a scene from Civil War.\nMotion handling is very good on the Bravia 8 II. Watching a reference scene from the film No Time to Die, where James Bond walks across a hillside cemetery, there was only a slight degree of judder and blur visible, and it could be easily lessened by setting the TV\u2019s Motionflow Smoothness settings to Film (2) and Camera (2).\n- Picture quality score: 5 / 5\nSony Bravia 8 II review: Sound quality\n- Acoustic Surface Audio+ turns the screen into a speaker\n- Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support\n- Acoustic Center Sync lets you connect TV with external speakers\nAcoustic Surface Audio+ on the Bravia 8 II uses actuators positioned behind the TV\u2019s screen that transform the entire screen into a speaker. This design provides a sense of dialogue emanating directly from the characters on-screen, and it also lets sound effects track accurately with the action.\nBoth the Dolby Atmos and DTS:X sound formats are supported by the Bravia 8 II, along with IMAX Enhanced. The latter means you can stream the library of movies with DTS:X soundtracks contained in both the Sony Pictures Core and Disney+ apps, and experience them with IMAX Enhanced post-processing, which is intended to deliver the same extended dynamic range you hear in IMAX cinemas.\nDialogue in movies like Civil War sounded clear and well-defined on the Bravia 8 II, and the Voice Zoom 3 feature helped to elevate voices in battle scenes with lots of background noise. The TV\u2019s Acoustic Center Sync feature, meanwhile, let me use it as a center channel speaker by connecting a cable from the TV to Sony\u2019s Bravia Theater Quad wireless speakers, while the Bravia Connect app made it easy to calibrate the center channel level for a smooth blend with the rest of the system.\nOnce I had that set up, the TV worked very effectively as a center channel speaker, with voices sounding natural and full-bodied. Listened to on its own without the Bravia Theater Quad setup, the TV\u2019s built-in speakers delivered reasonably full sound with movies, with a good sense of ambience, but bass was limited \u2013 something to be expected from a TV with such a slim profile.\n- Sound quality score: 4.5 / 5\nSony Bravia 8 II review: Design\n- Slim One Slate design\n- Two-way aluminum support feet\n- Full-sized, backlit remote control\nSony\u2019s Slim One Slate design for the Bravia 8 II gives the TV a bezel-free 'all-picture' look, and its textured back panel makes things look good even from the back and sides. Sturdy aluminum support feet at the TV\u2019s outer edges can be set for either a flush installation with the screen positioned directly on a stand or an elevated one, with three inches of space cleared for a soundbar.\nConnections are located in a side-mounted panel and include four HDMI ports with two HDMI 2.1 inputs providing 4K 120Hz support, a mini-jack speaker input for the Acoustic Center Sync feature, USB-A and Ethernet ports, and an antenna input for the TV\u2019s ATSC 3.0 broadcast tuner (US-only). Sony gives you detachable panels to conceal the input and power cord sections post-installation, which will reduce cable clutter and maintain the TV\u2019s 360-degree good looks.\nSony\u2019s medium-sized remote control sits comfortably in the hand and includes a full enough array of control buttons that you won\u2019t have to visit the TV\u2019s onscreen menus to do something as simple as switch inputs. Direct access buttons are provided for key apps like Netflix and Prime Video, and also for more obscure ones such as the Crunchyroll Anime service.\nOddly, the Bravia 8 II\u2019s remote isn\u2019t the same Eco Remote version provided with last year\u2019s Bravia 8 and Sony Bravia 9 TVs, one that uses a USB-C port for charging. It is made from 79.7% recycled plastic, however.\n- Design score: 4.5 / 5\nSony Bravia 8 II review: Smart TV and menus\n- Google TV\n- Live program grid integrates FAST and broadcast channels\n- Quick Settings menu provides easy access to adjustments\nSony TVs use the Google TV smart TV platform, one with a homescreen dominated by a big rotating banner up top with ads for shows. Some of those ads, along with the row of \u2018Top picks for you\u2019 content suggestions directly below, are based on your viewing and web browsing activity, which is something you give Google access to when you sign in with a Google account.\nGoogle TV offers a complete array of streaming apps, and these are arrayed in a row at the bottom of the homescreen in an order that can be customized. Tabs at the top of the homescreen let you access Live TV and Sony screens, among other options, with the Sony screen providing access to Sony Pictures Core movie streaming selections as well as instructional videos on how to operate the TV.\nThe Live TV screen is worth commenting upon because it nicely integrates Google Freeplay free ad-supported TV (FAST) channels with broadcast TV ones pulled in by the TV\u2019s ATSC 3.0 tuner. Both FAST and broadcast channels can be browsed in a time-based program grid, with program information provided for each channel.\nAs with other Google TVs, accessing picture, sound, and system settings on the Bravia 8 II involves pressing the gear icon on the remote, or the same thing on the top right corner of the Google TV homescreen. Sony provides an extensive range of adjustments for dialing in the Bravia 8 II\u2019s picture, although getting to these involves wading deep through menus.\nAn easier option for making adjustments is to press the wrench icon button on the remote, which calls up the TV\u2019s Quick Settings menu at the bottom of the screen. From here you can scroll through options like picture settings, picture modes, brightness, and various audio adjustments, and you can also edit the menu to add or remove options.\n- Smart TV & menus score: 4 / 5\nSony Bravia 8 II review: Gaming\n- Two HDMI 2.1 ports with 4K 120Hz support\n- Perfect for PlayStation 5 features\n- Comparatively high 16.3ms input lag\nThe Bravia 8 II offers a fair number of gaming features, the most notable being 'Perfect for PlayStation 5' features, which include an Auto HDR Tone Mapping mode when input from a PS5 gaming console is detected to match the dynamic range of the generated images to exactly what the screen is capable of showing.\nAn Auto Genre Picture Mode feature will also automatically turn on the TV\u2019s Game picture mode for the PS5, and Sony\u2019s Game Menu 2 lets you make onscreen gaming-related picture and other adjustments.\nOther gaming features supported by the Bravia 8 II include Dolby Vision gaming, variable refresh rate, and auto low-latency mode. Two of the TV\u2019s four HDMI 2.1 inputs support 4K 120 Hz input for gaming consoles, though nowadays it's becoming more common to see three or more HDMI 2.1 inputs on TVs.\nUsing a Leo Bodnar 4K meter, I measured input lag in Game Mode on the Bravia 8 II at 16.3ms, a notably higher level than on other TVs we\u2019ve recently tested, some of which measure below 10ms on the same test.\n- Gaming score: 4 / 5\nSony Bravia 8 II review: Value\n- Priced roughly the same as top OLED competition\n- Lower overall brightness than top OLED competition\n- Less extensive gaming features than competition\nAt its $2.999 reduced price in the US, the Bravia 8 II currently costs less than the 2025 flagship OLED TVs from LG and Samsung. But does that make it a great OLED TV value?\nThe Bravia 8 II has fantastic overall picture quality, with high brightness for an OLED TV. Its picture lacks the mini-LED-rivalling brightness levels of the Samsung S95F and LG G5, however, and it looks best in dimmed lighting conditions, where the TV\u2019s exceptional contrast, rich color, and fine detail can be fully appreciated.\nSony\u2019s top OLED also has impressive sound quality for such a slim and stylish TV, and it provides several features that let it easily integrate with compatible Sony soundbars and wireless speakers for even better sound performance.\nThe Bravia 8 II\u2019s Gaming features, while good, aren\u2019t as extensive as what you\u2019ll find on top TVs from Samsung and LG, though there are particular benefits for PlayStation 5 console owners.\nLooked at in terms of value, the Bravia 8 II is specifically a best bet for movie fans who don\u2019t mind dimming the lights a bit, though its picture is also bright enough to hold up in well-lit rooms. It doesn\u2019t exactly beat this year\u2019s flagship OLED TV competition, but with price reductions having already kicked in, at least it's competitively priced.\n- Value score: 4 / 5\nShould I buy the Sony Bravia 8 II?\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nFeatures | Innovative Sony-centric audio features and special capabilities for PS5 owners make this an appealing TV for Sony fans | 4.5 / 5 |\nPicture quality | Impressive brightness, color and contrast plus a detailed, accurate picture make this set especially easy on the eyes | 5 / 5 |\nSound quality | Sony's Acoustic Surface Audio+ feature delivers relatively full, spacious sound from a slim TV | 4.5 / 5 |\nDesign | A slim, elegant design with cable management and two-way adjustable feet that can clear space for a soundbar | 4.5 / 5 |\nSmart TV and menus | Google TV is a solid smart TV system and Sony's Quick Settings menu provides easy access to picture and sound adjustments | 4 / 5 |\nGaming | Good features for PS5 owners, but only two HDMI 2.1 ports and comparatively high input lag in Game mode | 4 / 5 |\nValue | Pricey, but its impressive picture and sound quality help it to stand up to the premium OLED competition | 4 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want a great TV for movies\nThe Bravia 8 II has great overall picture quality, and its picture processing makes everything, even old TV shows and YouTube videos look good, but it really shines with 4K movies on streaming and Blu-ray disc.\nYou want to use it with a Sony soundbar or wireless speakers\nThe Bravia 8 II has audio features that let it be used as a center speaker in a Sony surround sound system with compatible Sony soundbars and wireless speakers.\nYou mainly watch in bright rooms\nWhile the Bravia 8 II has high brightness for an OLED TV, it doesn\u2019t hit the same mini-LED brightness levels as its flagship competition, a quality that makes those TVs a good option for bright room viewing.\nDon't buy it if\u2026\nYou want the best TV for gaming\nThe Bravia 8 II has a solid set of gaming features, but there are only two HDMI 2.1 ports, and it lacks the same cloud-based gaming options found on LG and Samsung TVs.\nYou mainly watch in a bright room\nWhile the Bravia 8 II has high brightness for an OLED TV, it doesn\u2019t hit the same mini-LED brightness levels as its flagship competition that makes them a good option for bright room viewing.\nYou want to save money\nThe Bravia 8 II is a premium OLED TV that sells for a premium price. Cheaper mini-LED TV options are widely available that offer very good picture quality at a much lower price.\nSony Bravia 8 II: Also consider...\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Sony Bravia 8 II | LG G5 | Samsung S95F | Sony Bravia 8 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\nList price (65-inch) | $3,399 / \u00a33,399 / AU$5,295 | $3,399 / \u00a33,299 / AU$5,299 | $2,699 / \u00a32,699 / AU$4,299 | $2,799 / \u00a32,699 / AU$4,495 |\nScreen type | QD-OLED | OLED | QD-OLED | OLED |\nRefresh rate | 120Hz | 165Hz | 165Hz | 120Hz |\nHDR support | Dolby Vision/HDR10/HLG | Dolby Vision/HDR10/HLG | HDR10+/HDR10/HLG | DolbyVision/HDR10/HLG |\nSmart TV | Google TV | webOS | Tizen | Google TV |\nHDMI ports | 4 (2 x HDMI 2.1) | 4x HDMI 2.1 | 4 x HDMI 2.1 | 4 (2x HDMI 2.1) |\nLG G5\nThe LG G5\u2019s innovative \u2018four-stack\u2019 OLED panel delivers exceptional brightness levels for an OLED TV. It also has a superior set of gaming features compared to the Bravia 8 II, along with a more advanced smart TV platform.\nHere\u2019s our LG G5 review\nSamsung S95F\nSamsung\u2019s flagship OLED TV is another OLED that delivers mini-LED-rivalling brightness levels, and its Glare Free 2.0 screen effectively eliminates reflections when viewing in bright rooms. Like the LG G5, it also has a superior set of gaming features and a more advanced smart TV platform.\nHere\u2019s our Samsung S95F review\nSony Bravia 8\nThe Bravia 8 is still available, and it provides many of the same audio and gaming features as the Bravia 8 II. Its picture has notably lower peak brightness than the Bravia 8 II, but if you\u2019re okay with dimming the lights, you\u2019ll get a great OLED picture at a much reduced price.\nHere\u2019s our Sony Bravia 8 review\nHow I tested the Sony Bravia 8 II\n- I spent about 15 viewing hours in total, measuring and evaluating\n- Measurements were made using Calman color calibration software\n- A full calibration was made before proceeding with subjective tests\nWhen I test TVs, I first spend a few days or even weeks using them for casual viewing to assess the out-of-box picture presets and get familiar with the smart TV menu and picture adjustments.\nI next select the most accurate preset (usually Filmmaker Mode, Movie or Cinema) and measure grayscale and color accuracy using Portrait Displays\u2019 Calman color calibration software. The resulting measurements provide Delta-E values (the margin of error between the test pattern source and what\u2019s shown on-screen) for each category, and allow for an assessment of the TV\u2019s overall accuracy.\nAlong with those tests, I make measurements of peak light output (recorded in nits) for both standard high-definition and 4K high dynamic range using 10% and 100% white window patterns. Coverage of DCI-P3 and BT.2020 color space is also measured, with the results providing a sense of how faithfully the TV can render the extended color range in ultra high-definition sources \u2013 you can read more about this process in our guide to how we test TVs at TechRadar.\nFor the Sony Bravia 8 II, I used the Calman ISF workflow, along with the TV\u2019s advanced picture menu settings, to calibrate the image for best accuracy. I also watched a range of reference scenes on 4K Blu-ray discs to assess the TV\u2019s performance, along with 4K HDR shows streamed from Max, Netflix, and other services.\n- First reviewed: June 2025\n- Read TechRadar's reviews guarantee\nAl Griffin has been writing about and reviewing A/V tech since the days LaserDiscs roamed the earth, and was previously the editor of Sound & Vision magazine.\nWhen not reviewing the latest and greatest gear or watching movies at home, he can usually be found out and about on a bike.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

Detail is the whole point of 4K \u2013 most of the time, you won\u2019t be able to see the pixels in a 4K display, so everything looks natural and sharp. It\u2019s great for photos, videos and gaming for this reason, but actually it\u2019s superior for just about everything \u2013 it\u2019s nicer when text looks smoother on a computer, for example.\nThe vast majority of the time, 4K refers to a specific resolution of 3840 x 2160 (which is also known as \u2018Ultra HD\u2019) \u2013 this is the resolution of all 4K TVs and 4K video streams from the likes of Netflix or YouTube. Some cameras record in what\u2019s often known as \u2018Cinema 4K\u2019, which is a resolution of 4096 x 2160. You may find that some computer monitors refer to themselves as 4K, and will have a horizontal resolution around 4,000 pixels, but have a different height to the resolutions mentioned above, such as ultra-wide monitors. The width is what makes something 4K or not.\nYou\u2019ll mostly see 4K referred to in TVs of 40 inches and above, in computer and laptop monitors, on video streaming services, and in video recording on cameras or phones.\nLatest about 4K\nI tested the Samsung S95F and LG G5 OLED TVs side-by-side: here's which one you should get\nBy James Davidson published\nIt's Samsung Vs LG in the battle of premium OLED TVs in 2025\nI love 4K Blu-ray, and these are the 6 discs I want to treat myself to on my birthday\nBy James Davidson published\n4K Blu-rays and my birthday go hand-in-hand: here's the discs I'll be hoping to add to my collection\nThe best TV, chosen by our reviewers for all budgets\nBy Al Griffin last updated\nTop OLED and QLED sets to consider, from elite TVs to wallet-friendly options \u2013 all tested by us.\nThe 13 best PS4 Pro games to play in 2025\nBy Rob Dwiar last updated\nGet the most out of Sony's enhanced console from last gen with one of the best PS4 Pro games.\nDell Pro 32 Plus business monitor review\nBy Collin Probst published\nThe Dell Pro 32 Plus packs 32 inches of beautiful 4K picture at 100Hz, decent ports, Native Mac compatibility, and a brightness that caps at 350 nits.\nThis 34-inch business monitor is curved, fast, has Ethernet, Smart KVM, and a webcam \u2014 shame there\u2019s no 5K option for creative users\nBy Wayne Williams published\nAOC's 34-inch curved WQHD panel features Ethernet, Smart KVM, a webcam, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nThe best 75-inch TVs, all tested by our big-screen experts\nBy Al Griffin last updated\nUpdated The best 75-inch TVs offer a true big-screen experience, with a size befitting the greatest films and the most nail-biting sports matches.\nThere's a huge Criterion Collection 4K Blu-ray sale happening at Amazon ahead of Prime Day \u2013 here are the 5 movies I'd pick\nBy James Davidson published\nMajor savings of the best 4k Blu-rays you can add to your collection\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more."

      "text": "The best TVs for sound: from Sony, Panasonic, Hisense and more\nThe best TVs for sound offer theater-style audio without adding any extra devices\nThe best TVs for sound deliver great picture quality and dynamic, room-filling sound to go with it. Although it might seem like as the picture performance of TVs advances, sound tends to suffer, there are a few excellent TVs on the market with a built-in sound system that'll blow you away.\nAs TVs have gotten thinner over the years, there is less space in the display\u2019s physical frame for adding speakers. The end result\u2014in some cases\u2014has been sound that\u2019s as thin as the TV itself. This makes hearing voices particularly difficult, especially when they are mixed with music soundtracks and movie sound effects.\nSo, even with many of the best TVs you can buy today, we highly recommend you invest in one of the best soundbars or the best surround sound systems. Of course, we also understand that going down that route requires more research\u2014checking you have enough space and the right connections\u2014and extra budget.\nIf you're looking to hit two targets with one arrow, however, know that there are also options for you. There are several TVs on the market that come with superb sound systems as standard, allowing you to get good sound quality with no extra gear or work necessary.\nWe've tested hundreds of TVs over the years, so we know what makes a great package. Rest assured, each of the TV displays on our list don't just sound good, they look fantastic and have much of the best TV tech built-in too. Whether it\u2019s a Hollywood blockbuster or just back episodes of Friends, the TVs we've selected below will make sure that whatever you\u2019re watching sounds as good as it can.\nBest TVs for sound: Quick List\nBest overall\nThe best TV for sound overall\nDelivering powerful, immersive built-in sound with realistic Dolby Atmos reproduction and smart sound zones, this is simply the best-sounding TV you can get.\nBest mid-range OLED\nThe best mid-range OLED TV for sound\nAccurate placement and impressive dynamics range are just two reasons why the Sony Bravia 8 is unbeatable for built-in sound at the mid-range OLED price.\nBest mid-range mini-LED\nThe best mid-range mini-LED TV for sound\nOutperforming its superb value price, the Hisense U8N delivers surprisingly accurate and vivid sound in a category that often falters when it comes to built-in audio.\nBest budget (UK)\nThe best budget TV for sound in the UK\nClear, direct and punchy, the Amazon Fire TV Omni QLED takes a no-frills approach to its built-in sound.

Dynamic, powerful and engaging, the Z95A really is your best bet if you're looking for a TV that offers cinematic sound without the need for a soundbar.\nIn our review, we were most impressed with the Z95A's consistently clear dialogue and also how effective its Dolby Atmos reproduction was, noting sound effects such as falling rain \"actually sounded like they were falling from the ceiling.\" Bass was also surprisingly punchy during testing, with plenty of depth and impact on offer.\nIt's not just in sound performance where the Z95A impresses, but also features. Space Tune uses a built-in mic in the remote control to analyze the viewing environment and calibrate sound accordingly, with effective results. There's also Sound Focus mode, which allows for adjustment of off-center sound with four settings \u2013 Pinpoint, Area, Spot and Ambient \u2013 and again results were superb.\nThe Z95A is also a picture powerhouse, delivering excellent brightness levels for an OLED TV, but also superb shadow detail, bold colors and excellent motion handling. We found we had to adjust brightness settings on occasion, but this was the only real complaint.\nThe Z95A is at the pricey end of the TV market \u2013 with the 65-inch model retailing for roughly $3,199/\u00a33,299, but its built-in sound is so good it didn't belong anywhere else other than top of the list for best TVs for sound.\nRead our full Panasonic Z95A review\nThe best mid-range OLED TV for sound\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a less expensive OLED TV with great sound: The Bravia 8 is priced lower than the Panasonic Z95A OLED, our top pick in this guide, while still offering very good overall sound quality.\n\u2705 You own a Sony soundbar or speakers: When used with a Sony soundbar or wireless speakers, the Bravia 8\u2019s Acoustic Center Sync feature lets the TV\u2019s built-in audio system be used as a center channel speaker.\n\u274c You want the brightest OLED TV you can buy: The Bravia 8\u2019s picture brightness is average compared to pricier, premium OLED TVs on the market, making it a good choice mainly for rooms where you\u2019ll dim the lights.\n\u274cYou want a TV with comprehensive HDR support: The Bravia 8 supports the Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HLG high dynamic range formats, but lacks the HDR10+ support offered by the Panasonic Z95A OLED.\nThe Sony Bravia 8 delivers better sound than any other mid-tier OLED TV \u2013 it's dynamic, accurate and has an expansive enough soundstage to stave off the need for a soundbar. But when it's paired with a compatible Sony soundbar, such as the Bravia Theater 8, even more magic happens with a feature called bravia Acosutic Center Sync, where the Bravia 8 TV can be used as a center channel to add more depth to the attached Sony soundbar's sound.\nUsing actuators to create vibrations for sound through the screen itself, the Bravia 8 delivers big audio to match its pictures. Sounds are accurately placed around the screen to match the action, and it can go loud without a loss of clarity.\nWe said in our review, regarding its speakers, that \"it really is a remarkable system\" and this was prevalent watching Shang Chi and the Ten Rings, where action sequences demonstrated the Bravia 8's accuracy of positioning through wind gusts, movement and more. While we did find bass lacking compared to a dedicated system, we said the Bravia 8 is \"still more engaging than most other TV sound systems\".\nThe Bravia 8 also delivers with its picture, offering the superb contrast and vivid colors you'd expect from an OLED TV, along with realistic details. Despite lower brightness than rival OLEDs such as the LG C4, the XR Processor does the work to ensure highlights are bright and bold, and colorful images still shine. While it also lacks the same level of gaming features as some other rival OLEDs, it still supporta 4K 120Hz with variable refresh rate on two of its four HDMI ports, and 'Perfect for PS5' features ideal for PS5 owners.\nSo, why is the Bravia 8 not top of the list? It comes down to performance. While the Bravia 8 is less expensive, it just can't match up to the Panasonic Z95A in terms of sheer immersion. However, for those who want an OLED with great sound and can't stretch their budget to the lofty heights of the Z95A, the Bravia 8 should be to top of the list.\nRead our full Sony Bravia 8 review\nThe best mid-range mini-LED TV for sound\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a super-bright TV: Using a powerful mini-LED backlight, the U8N picture brightness exceeds most other TVs on this list.\n\u2705 You\u2019re on a budget: Despite its high brightness and impressive overall picture and sound quality, the U8N is among the more affordable TVs in this guide.\n\u274c You want a TV that looks great from all angles: The U8N\u2019s picture contrast and color saturation quickly fades when it\u2019s viewed from far off-center seats, making it less optimal for viewing with large groups.\n\u274cYou want the best TV for gaming: The U8N\u2019s gaming performance and features are average at best. If you\u2019re looking for the best possible TV for gaming, you\u2019ll want to look elsewhere.\nThe Hisense U8N is a high-value TV that uses mini-LED backlight technology to deliver bright images with bold colors. It\u2019s available in screen sizes ranging from 55 to 85 inches and has built-in 2.1.2-channel speakers with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support. While it doesn\u2019t provide the same extensive level of sound features as the Panasonic Z95A and Sony Bravia 8 in this list, it offers much better than average sound quality, and even includes a built-in 'subwoofer' to enhance bass.\nIn our Hisense U8N review, we said of the TV\u2019s sound quality that \u201cdialogue was clear and full, and the built-in subwoofer made bass effects sound surprisingly weighty.\u201d The TV\u2019s two up-firing speakers also created an impressive sense of height when watching movies with Dolby Atmos soundtracks. We normally recommend adding a soundbar to a TV, but the U8N could easily go without one and still deliver sound that will satisfy most people.\nOutside of its sound, the Hisense U8N is one of the brightest sets we\u2019ve tested yet, and that capability plus its low-reflection screen make it a great option for both daytime TV and sports viewing. It uses the Google TV smart TV platform for streaming in the US (and Hisense\u2019s own VIDAA smart TV platform in the UK and Australia) and supports Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and HLG high dynamic range formats. Gaming features include two HDMI 2.1 ports with support for 4K 120Hz, VRR up to 144Hz (including FreeSync Premium Pro), ALLM, and Dolby Vision 4K gaming.\nThe Hisense U8N is an exceptional value and it improves on the last year's Hisense U8K \u2013 our previous mid-range pick \u2013 in almost every way, including sound quality. It even has an Auto Acoustic Tuning feature that uses the remote\u2019s mic to adapt the sound to your viewing space. The U8N is a great choice if you have a tight budget and don\u2019t want to spring for a soundbar when buying a big TV.\nRead our full Hisense U8N review\nThe best budget TV for sound in the UK\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You\u2019re on a tight budget: The Omni QLED offers good overall picture and sound quality for the money, but there are much better options available if you can spend extra.\n\u2705 You\u2019re an Amazon Prime TV subscriber: The Amazon Fire TV smart interface provides tight integration with the Amazon Prime TV services, with targeted recommendations for subscribers.\n\u274c You want a TV with great picture quality: The Omni QLED\u2019s picture quality is at best average. You\u2019ll get better brightness, contrast, and black uniformity by spending more for a higher-quality TV.\n\u274cYou want a great TV for gaming: While the Omni QLED has low input lag and impressive motion processing, it lacks key gaming TV features such as 4K 120Hz support.\nThe Amazon Fire TV Omni QLED admittedly doesn't have a sound that will best the other entries on this list, limited to two 12W speakers with no Dolby Atmos support. But it does deliver a direct and clear sound that will suit people for day-to-day viewing \u2013 better than any other cheap TV we've tested.\nIn our Omni QLED review, we found that if you set the sound mode to Movie, you'll get a clear, direct sound that carries decent bass levels that demonstrated the rumble of jets in Top Gun: Maverick with plenty of punch and clear speech levels \u2013 even in scenes with unclear dialogue. There's no Dolby Atmos speaker system here \u2013 unsurprising at this price range \u2013 but it's clear Amazon has taken a no-frills approach with the Omni QLED's sound, focusing on clarity rather than immersion.\nElsewhere, the Omni QLED offers solid picture quality, with vibrant colors and clean textures and despite the lack of 4K 120Hz support, the Omni QLED's gaming performance at 60Hz is good \u2013 and there's Dolby Vision gaming, variable refresh rate and ALLM support as well.\nWhile the Omni QLED could benefit from a soundbar for those looking for a more cinematic sound, its built-in sound is decent and will serve most people for casual viewing well and while it won't blow any minds, not many TVs at a budget price can beat the Omni QLED.\nRead our full Amazon Fire TV Omni QLED review\nThe best budget TV for sound in the US\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You\u2019re on a budget: Roku Pro Series TVs deliver impressive picture and sound quality for the money, and they even use a mini-LED backlight to boost picture brightness and contrast.oney, but there are much better options available if you can spend extra.\n\u2705 You want a great smart TV interface: Roku has one of the best smart TV interfaces around, offering easy, intuitive navigation with significantly less screen clutter than its competitors.\n\u274c You crave brightness: Despite having a mini-LED backlight, the Pro Series manages only average picture brightness compared to its mini-LED TV competition.\n\u274cYou crave bass: While we gave the Pro Series high marks for overall sound quality when we reviewed it, other TVs in this guide deliver better built-in bass.\nThe Roku Pro Series is the company\u2019s flagship TV lineup and one that uses a mini-LED backlight to boost picture brightness and contrast to a higher level than the mid-range Roku Select series TVs. Notably, the Pro Series sets feature a thicker shadowbox-style design that allows for bigger built-in speakers that are side-firing rather than the downward-firing ones found in many TVs, the Select series included.\nWhen describing the TV\u2019s sound quality in our Roku Pro Series TV review, we said \u201cDetails in the high frequencies retain body as well as clarity,\u201d and that \u201cmids are nice and full.\u201d About the only thing we felt was missing was bass, and that can be easily \u2013 and inexpensively \u2013 fixed by adding one of the company\u2019s wireless subwoofers to the TV. (Roku wireless surround sound speakers that link up with Roku TVs are also available.)\nOther than sound, Pro Series TVs use the same streamlined smart interface found in the company\u2019s streaming devices. The TV\u2019s Voice Remote Pro has a backlit keypad and a hands-free option that lets you control the TV using voice commands without having to touch the remote. A Smart Picture feature can automatically optimize the picture settings based on what your viewing, and the TV\u2019s two HDMI 2.1 ports support 4K 120Hz input for gaming.\nOne of the best things about the Roku Pro Series is its price, which is very affordable for a TV this feature-packed. Add in the fact that the Pro Series\u2019 impressive sound quality means you don\u2019t necessarily need to buy a soundbar, and its value increases even further.\nRead our full Roku Pro Series review\nThe best premium mini-LED TV for sound\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You\u2019re on a budget: Roku Pro Series TVs deliver impressive picture and sound quality for the money, and they even use a mini-LED backlight to boost picture brightness and contrast.oney, but there are much better options available if you can spend extra.\n\u2705 You want a great smart TV interface: Roku has one of the best smart TV interfaces around, offering easy, intuitive navigation with significantly less screen clutter than its competitors.\n\u274c You want the best possible picture: We gave the Bravia 9 five stars for picture quality in our review, citing its high brightness, rich color, and exceptional shadow detail.\n\u274cYou own a Sony soundbar or speakers: When used with a Sony soundbar or wireless speakers, the Bravia 0\u2019s Acoustic Center Sync feature lets the TV\u2019s built-in audio system be used as a center channel speaker.\nThe Sony Bravia 9\u2019s Acoustic Multi Audio+ design solves the problem of disconnected TV sound by using tweeters installed in the left and right sides of the TV\u2019s frame. These work to elevate dialogue so it sounds like it\u2019s coming directly from the mouths of characters talking onscreen, and they also make the positioning of sound effects accurate and natural. And in contrast to the virtual Dolby Atmos processing used by most TVs, the Bravia 9 has 'Beam' drivers located on top that create a real sense of spaciousness by bouncing sound off your room\u2019s ceiling.\nThe Bravia 9\u2019s 2.2.2-channel speaker system is powered by 70 watts of amplification, and supports Dolby Atmos and DTS:X immersive soundtracks. 3D Surround Upscaling adds spaciousness to regular stereo or mono soundtracks, and a feature called Voice Zoom 3 uses AI to isolate dialogue and boost it separately to enhance the clarity of voices.\nAnother feature, Acoustic Center Sync, allows for a compatible Sony soundbar or speakers to be connected to the Bravia 9 so its built-in speakers can be used as the center channel in a surround sound system. When this setup is configured, Sony\u2019s 360 Spatial Sound Mapping processing will create 'phantom' speakers between the actual ones for even greater immersion.\nWhen we tested the Sony Bravia 9, we used Acoustic Center Sync to pair the TV with a Sony Bravia Home Theater Quad wireless speaker system, creating a 5.1.4-channel configuration. The result: \u201cthe Bravia 9 integrated perfectly with the external audio system, delivering smooth and seamless sound.\u201d\nOn the picture quality front, the Sony Bravia 9 is a flagship mini-LED TV and exclusively features the company\u2019s XR Backlight Master Drive with High Peak Luminance tech to deliver pictures with high peak brightness and refined local dimming for detailed blacks. It also has an anti-reflection screen, making it a great option for both movies and sports, and it supports 4K 120Hz for gaming on two HDMI 2.1 ports.\nRead our full Sony Bravia 9 review\nThe best TV for sound: FAQs\nHow to choose the best TV for sound\nIf you're looking for the best TV for sound, first consider whether you need one. There are many more options available if you're willing to get a great-looking TV with mediocre sound and pair it with a soundbar or sound system instead.\nHowever, if you have your heart set on an all-in-one package like the TVs listed above, keep your eyes peeled for a few key specifications. For example, power is important when it comes to sound. We've listed this as the number of Watts under each TV. The higher the number, the more powerful the sound. Granted, the best sound isn't always the most powerful, but it's a good indication as to whether you're going to get an immersive room-filling sound from your new TV.\nThe number of built-in speakers matters, too. Many TVs have 2 speakers, but the more you have, the more wide and expansive the soundstage will be. For example, the Panasonic Z95A in our list above has a 5.1.2ch speaker system for a fuller-sounding experience.\nAlthough sound is a priority, don't overlook other important factors, too. Ensure that the picture quality is going to work well in your living room. For example, some TVs work better in bright light environments than others. And, of course, be sure to measure your space first to check you have room for your new display.\nWhat's the best sound quality in a TV?\nDTS:X and Dolby Atmos are the main home cinema audio formats. These rival technologies are both audio compression technologies that create a surround sound effect both in cinemas and in the home.\nSo which is better? Opinion is divided. DTS:X is encoded in a higher bitrate so should technically be better quality audio. But Atmos claims to be more advanced, and capable of producing a higher quality sound at a lower bitrate. As is often the case, it comes down to personal taste.\nAtmos is more widely supported \u2013 by Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, among others \u2013 and most modern TVs are compatible with it, whereas DTS:X requires a separate audio system.\nRead more in our DTS:X vs Dolby Atmos vs DTS Play-Fi guide.\nNew TVs coming in 2025\nSuccessors to some of the TVs on this list have been announced for 2025, and those models will soon be arriving in stores. We expect to post reviews of them as quickly as possible, but for now, the listings in this guide stand as our current top choices as the best TVs for sound.\nThe Panasonic Z95B will have a similar 5.1.2-channel speaker array as the Panasonic Z95A, but will also provide enhanced spatial audio processing and a new woofer configuration for more powerful bass. The Z95B additionally features the same cutting-edge \u2018four stack\u2019 OLED display panel used in the LG G5 OLED TV.\nSony\u2019s Bravia 8 II also gets a display panel upgrade, shifting from W-OLED to the same, substantially brighter QD-OLED one found in the new Samsung S95F. Like the Bravia 8, the Bravia 8 II features Acoustic Surface Audio+, which uses speakers embedded behind the display for fuller sound, and Acoustic Center Sync, which lets the TV be used as a center channel. The Bravia 8 II will also feature dual subwoofers for improved bass performance.\nThe Hisense U8QG will get a substantial sound upgrade over its predecessor, jumping to a 4.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos speaker configuration over the U8N\u2019s 2.1.2-channel array. Like the U8N, it will also support DTS:X and is IMAX Enhanced certified. With up to 5,000 nits specified peak brightness, the U8QG series is also brighter than its predecessor and will feature up to 5,600 local dimming zones.\nRoku Pro series TVs will also be getting an update in 2025, with the new models getting custom factory calibration to ensure best performance. Roku didn\u2019t provide any information about sound upgrades to the Pro Series, which remains our top budget choice (US) in this guide.\nHow we test the best TVs for sound\nHow we test the best TVs for sound\n\u2611\ufe0f More than 2,600 TV and home theater reviews\n\u2611\ufe0f 16 years of product testing\n\u2611\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2611\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nTo test the best TVs for sound, we watched a range of content on each of these displays, really listening out for some key criteria. This mostly included how the audio formats DTS:X and Dolby Atmos performed. Did they give the experience of surround sound? What was lacking? Did settings need to be adjusted considerably to get the desired effect? Did the TV deliver on the power listed in the specs?\nIn our reviews above, we've answered the key questions you'll need to know when considering the best TVs for sound, ensuring we tried TV shows, movies and games to let you know which might be better suited for certain kinds of content.\nAlthough this guide is very much focused on audio specs, no one wants a TV that sounds great and looks mediocre. That's why every TV on this list has also been tested against the criteria we apply to all of our TV buying guides.\nThis includes rating picture quality, clarity and brightness. It also involves testing smart features, assistants and checking all of the best streaming apps work well. As well as living with the TV for some time, ensuring that all content types display well, viewing angles are good for a range of environments and much more.\nWe've tested hundreds of TVs over the years, which means you're in safe hands. Not only are we well equipped to pick the best TVs for sound, we also have extensive experience of the market as a whole, so can confidently select the TVs that deliver rather than relying on their specs.\nLatest updates to this guide\nMay 9, 2025\nAdded 'New TVs for 2025' section to FAQ.\nFebruary 10, 2025\nAdded in 'Buy it if' and 'Don't buy it if' boxes for each entry to summarize pros and cons for quick reading.\nDecember 16, 2024\nAdded Roku Pro Series as 'Best budget (US)' option.\nRead more updates\nOctober 16, 2024\nGave this list an overhaul with new rankings and entries.

      "text": "I tested Samsung and LG's cheapest OLED TVs side-by-side to see which TV comes out on top \u2013 here's what happened\nWhich is the better entry-level OLED TV?\nLG and Samsung have been locked in an OLED TV battle for a number of years, ever since Samsung reentered the OLED TV market in 2022 with the Samsung S95B.\nSamsung has since been our TV of the year winner for two years in a row, with the Samsung S90C taking the crown in 2023 and the Samsung S95D taking the title in 2024. Even so, several LG OLED models still sit on our list for the best OLED TV.\nI\u2019ve already tested both brands' 2025 flagship models, the LG G5 and Samsung S95F, side-by-side. Recently, however, I also had the chance to do a side-by-side test of their entry-level OLEDs, the LG B5 and Samsung S85F.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that both these TVs use the same standard W-OLED display panel. So they can\u2019t really be that different, right? Well, let\u2019s look at the results of my comparison to find out.\nBrightness and contrast\nWith both TVs using the same panel, I expected their brightness measurements to be similar, and that did turn out to be the case. When I measured peak HDR brightness for both TVs, the LG B5 clocked in at 668 nits, and the S85F at 777 nits. I assumed a difference of just over 100 nits wouldn\u2019t make an impact on the picture, but I was wrong.\nAlthough the difference was subtle, the S85F\u2019s picture did have bolder highlights in specific movie scenes. Watching The Batman, highlights from light sources such as lamps and torches in the opening subway fight and crime scene sections were indeed brighter on the S85F. The B5 still demonstrated solid brightness, but I found my eye more drawn to the S85F\u2019s picture.\nIn demo footage from the Spears & Munsil UHD Benchmark 4K Blu-ray, with images such as the sun behind a satellite dish or a horizon at sunset, the S85F had a bit more vibrancy, which made these highlight areas look more striking.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nBoth the B5 and S85F demonstrated excellent contrast throughout testing. In The Batman, light sources balanced well with dark tones on screen, creating a good sense of contrast, though the S85F\u2019s higher brightness gave it an edge.\nBoth TVs also had refined shadow detail when watching The Batman, but the B5 displayed deeper, richer black tones, and it better maintained shadow detail, with the S85F showing minor black crush. In Oppenheimer\u2019s black and white scenes, both TVs again showed a good range of gray tones, but here again, the B5 maintained details in darker areas more accurately than the S85F.\nI noticed that while Filmmaker Mode was the more accurate mode for darker movies such as Oppenheimer and The Batman, the differences between the two TVs were more obvious in Cinema mode, especially when it came to brightness, contrast and shadow detail.\nColor profile\nWhere the B5 and S85F really differed was in their color. Although both use the same OLED panel type, the S85F\u2019s colors had a greater visual punch, especially when evaluating both TVs with their Cinema picture preset active.\nIn Wicked, during the Wizard & I scene where Elphaba stands under some pink flowers, the flowers looked more vibrant on the S85F than the B5, giving them an eye-popping quality. Elphaba\u2019s green skin also appeared brighter, and later in the Emerald City, the greens appeared more dazzling on the S85F.\nWhere the B5 differed here was in its color depth. The B5\u2019s deeper blacks had the effect of making the pink flowers and Elphaba\u2019s green skin look richer and more lifelike compared to the S85F.\nIn the same Spears & Munsil footage, shots of colorful butterflies and flowers looked rich and refined on both TVs, but once again, the B5 displayed deeper, richer, and more subtle hues, whereas the S85F had more outright colorful images. I found myself more drawn to the S85F, especially with both TVs in Cinema mode.\nSports\nOne thing I wanted to test on these TVs was sports viewing. OLEDs typically have very good motion handling, which is why they always feature in our best TVs for sport guide. I\u2019ve found that Samsung TVs require more setup effort when it comes to sports than LG TVs, and it was no different with the S85F.\nIn Standard mode (color in the B5\u2019s Sports mode is too oversaturated, so I preferred not to use it), the LG B5 displayed superior motion handling. An MLS soccer game I watched via Prime Video in this mode looked fluid and smooth throughout viewing, with no settings changes required.\nThe S85F, also in its Standard preset, showed several motion artifacts, such as a ghosting ball and some stuttering. Changing blur and judder reduction to 5 did help, but even then, there was some picture judder compared to the B5.\nOf the two TVs, the B5 was the clear winner when it came to motion handling.\nWhich TV should you choose?\nAfter testing both the LG B5 and Samsung S85F side-by-side, the differences are generally subtle, so which one you should buy will likely come down to personal preference.\nIf you want a brighter, bolder-looking TV with more vibrant color, opt for the S85F. If you want a more natural-looking TV with richer blacks, opt for the B5.\nBoth TVs have the full suite of gaming features we look for on the best gaming TVs, and both have great smart TV platforms. But sports fans will want to go for the B5 due to its superior motion handling.\nDuring my testing, I ultimately found myself more drawn to the S85F. So that\u2019s the one I\u2019d choose, but it was very close.\nHonestly, it could all come down to discounts. The 55-inch B5 costs $1,499.99 / \u00a31,399 / AU$1,995, and the 55-inch Samsung S85F costs $1,499.99 / \u00a31,399 / AU$2,495, so in the US and UK, there's currently nothing between them. But as we approach the end of the year, both TVs will inevitably receive discounts, and the amount of those discounts could determine which TV is the better overall value.\nYou might also like\n- Glare-Free vs anti-reflection: This is how Samsung and LG's flagship OLED TV screens fared when I tested them\n- I tested LG, Samsung and Sony's elite 2025 OLED TVs side-by-side \u2013 here's the one I'd buy with my own money\n- I tested LG's cheapest OLED TV and Samsung's more affordable mini-LED TV side-by-side and I know which one I'd buy\nJames is the TV Hardware Staff Writer at TechRadar.

TVs today are better than ever and can offer incredible value, and my vantage point as a longtime reviewer puts me in a perfect position to identify which models provide the best performance for the price. That perspective informs this guide, which ranks the best new TVs across a range of categories to help you find the best fit for your needs and budget.\nMy TV team and I have conducted hands-on reviews of the TVs in this guide using a process that includes objective measurements made with specialized test equipment. That measurement data is presented in the benchmark graphs that accompany each one of our TV reviews and is presented in the \u2018In-depth analysis\u2019 section for the entries in this guide.\nA TV\u2019s performance can\u2019t be judged by measurements alone, however, so we also do an extensive subjective evaluation using reference movie scenes and TV, primarily on 4K Blu-ray and regular Blu-ray disc formats to ensure consistency during testing. You can read about the testing process I developed with my team in our full article on how we test TVs at TechRadar.\nWhether you\u2019re looking for a budget-priced QLED TV that offers great picture quality for the price, or a more premium OLED model that pushes the performance envelope and also has cutting-edge features for gaming, this guide has you covered. The latest TVs can sometimes get clouded in a swirl of jargon, so check out our glossary in the \u2018How to choose\u2019 section for descriptions of the tech terms used in this guide.\n\u2b63 Read more\nWhy you can trust TechRadar's choices\nAt TechRadar, we test TVs ourselves on-site, with the review team led by Al Griffin, an ISF-trained video calibrator with nearly three decades of AV product testing experience. He has trained our staff reviewers to use industry-standard testing equipment to measure parameters such as TV brightness and color accuracy, and to balance them with subjective aspects of picture and sound quality, because measurements can only take you so far in determining a TV\u2019s overall performance.\nOur evaluation process goes beyond picture quality to encompass features and gaming performance, and overall value. Ratings are provided for various sections in our tests, and we provide measurement graphs that also feature comparable TVs, so you can see how well \u2013 or not \u2013 a TV fares against its competition to aid your decision-making.\nEach TV in this guide is vouched for by a team member who has summarized our evaluation, providing a concise yet in-depth overview of the information provided in our review.\nThe quick list\nWant the simplest guide to the best TVs around?

Previously, I was editor of Sound & Vision magazine, and I'm an ISF-trained TV calibrator. Having worked in AV product testing and tech journalism for almost three decades, I\u2019ve had my eyes on basically every flagship TV available.

We've tested each one extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\nThe best TV for most people\nSpecifications\n1-minute summary: Having reviewed both the LG C4 and its LG C3 predecessor, I can confirm that LG\u2019s new OLED TV is a solid upgrade and a great TV overall. The C4 features a new Alpha 9 AI Gen 7 processor that brings a noticeable boost in brightness, and it also improves detail and color in HDR sources. LG C4 OLEDs are well-equipped gaming TVs, with four HDMI ports that support 4K 120Hz (and up to 144Hz for PC gaming), VRR, and ALLM. A new Dolby Vision Filmmaker Mode preset gives you a director-approved picture out of the box and, with the C4 available in 42- up to 83-inch screens, there\u2019s a C4 sized to fit any situation, from desktop gaming to high-end home theater. The C4 isn\u2019t as bright as flagship OLED TVs such as the LG G4 and Samsung S95D, but its picture quality is almost as good, and you\u2019ll pay far more for those models. It really hits a sweet spot, delivering on every front for a lower price than nearly every other OLED TV on the market, making it the best OLED TV for most people.\nRead our full LG C4 review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want a reasonably priced OLED: The LG C4 strikes a perfect balance between performance, features, and value in an OLED TV.\n\u2705 You want a great TV for movies: The C4 has excellent contrast, color and detail. Combined with its new Dolby Vision Filmmaker Mode, it\u2019s an ideal TV for movies.\n\u2705 You want a great TV for gaming: The C4 has four HDMI 2.1 ports and is packed with gaming features for console, PC, and cloud-based gaming.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want great built-in audio: The C4\u2019s built-in speakers are fine, but those wanting better bass and more immersive sound should check out the Sony Bravia 8 or Samsung S95D.\n\u274c You want the brightest TV available: LG\u2019s C4 is brighter than its C3 predecessor, but it doesn\u2019t match mini-LED TVs such as the Hisense U8N, or flagship OLED TVs such as the Samsung S95D.\n\u274c You want the cheapest OLED: LG\u2019s entry-level B4 is the company\u2019s cheapest OLED TV series, although it\u2019s not as bright and isn\u2019t available in as many sizes.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nIn use, the C4 delivers a picture that\u2019s bright enough for viewing in rooms with moderate-to-high ambient light levels. I measured peak brightness on the LG C4 at 1,065 nits, a great number that puts it above most other rival mid-range OLED TVs. When watching in dim lighting conditions, its picture really pops to life, displaying rich color, deep blacks, and detailed shadows. Like other OLED TVs, the C4 looks good over a very wide viewing angle, so there\u2019s never a bad seat in the house \u2013 a benefit when watching sports with a group.\nThe same Alpha 9 AI Gen 7 processor responsible for the C4\u2019s picture-quality boost over the C3 also improves sound by upmixing audio for a virtual 9.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos presentation. When I reviewed the C4, I found the dialogue in TV shows and movie soundtracks to be consistently clear, and there was a good sense of spaciousness with the AI Sound Pro mode active. As with most TVs, bass was on the light side, so if you want cinematic sound it will be best to add a good soundbar. The C4 provides several features designed to work exclusively with LG soundbars, including Wow Cast, which wirelessly transmits Dolby Atmos audio from the TV to the soundbar, and Wow Orchestra, which syncs up the speakers in the TV and the soundbar for enhanced audio presentation.\nThe new webOS 24 smart interface on the C4 has been updated for a more streamlined look. A main feature is Quick Cards, which lets you store apps and settings in various categories including Games, Music, Home Hub, Sports, and Home Office. Content recommendations are located below these, though, like on other smart TV interfaces, they routinely push you toward a free ad-supported TV portal (LG Channels, in this case). LG\u2019s Magic Remote makes navigating everything easy, and a new Quick Menus provides easy access to picture and sound settings.\nThe LG C4 is a powerhouse TV for gaming. Its four HDMI 2.1 ports support 4K 120Hz, Nvidia G Sync and AMD FreeSync, and Dolby Vision gaming, and it\u2019s one of the first TVs to be 144Hz certified by Nvidia. Similar to Samsung TVs, the C4 has cloud-gaming options, with Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna, Utomik and other services supported. A Game Optimizer mode is automatically enabled when a gaming console is connected, reducing input lag as low as 9.2ms and providing a convenient pop-up game menu for making quick gaming-related adjustments.\nThe 55-inch version of the LG C4 is now available for around $1,399, making it a very good value. You\u2019ll pay nearly twice that amount for more flagship OLED TVs in that screen size from LG, Samsung, and Sony, and the picture quality advantages of those premium models, while real, aren\u2019t something that most viewers will miss. LG\u2019s C-Series OLED TVs have long represented a sweet spot for OLED TVs, and the C4 carries on that tradition.\nLG C4 test results\nThe best budget TV\nSpecifications\n1-minute summary: The Roku Plus and Select series were the company\u2019s first Roku-branded TVs, and while good, the Pro series was the budget TV home run I was waiting on. Starting at $899 for a 55-inch model, with 65- and 75-inch screen sizes also available, Roku Pro Series TVs step up with mini-LED backlight tech for a significantly brighter picture than you\u2019ll get in the mid-range Roku select series. Otherwise, the Roku Pro\u2019s picture is mostly free of the backlight blooming you see on some other budget mini-LED and regular LED TVs and it has comprehensive HDR support (including Dolby Vision and HDR10+ formats) plus a Smart Picture Max automatic mode that lets the TV do all the picture setup work for you and adapts dynamically for different content. It\u2019s well-equipped for gaming with two HDMI 2.1 ports supporting 4K 120Hz input along with VRR (with FreeSync) and ALLM and its side-mounted speakers deliver much better-than-average sound for a budget TV. Of course, being a Roku TV it has the famous Roku interface, which I think leapfrogs over other smart TV screens when it comes to ease of navigation.\nRead our full Roku Pro series review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want a premium TV without the price tag: The Roku Pro Series is a great value considering it is the most premium offering in the company\u2019s TV lineup.\n\u2705 You want to wall-mount your TV: Although it can be installed on a stand, Pro series TVs are designed to be wall-mounted and have a neat shadowbox case that makes it look like a framed painting.\n\u2705 You want an affordable TV with great built-in sound: The Pro Series was designed to be used without a soundbar, and its front-firing speakers provide reasonably full sound and can play loud.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want the brightest possible picture: Although picture quality on Pro series TVs is generally very good, the Hisense U8N offers superior brightness and better overall performance.\n\u274c You want a sophisticated smart platform: The Roku smart TV interface is basic compared to other smart TV platforms. For some, that\u2019s a benefit because it's so easy to use, but others may want a more sophisticated smart interface.\n\u274c You want the best gaming TV: While the Roku Pro Series offers a strong suite of gaming features, it's limited to two 4K 120Hz ports. Samsung and LG options on this list offer more flexibility and features.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nThe 55-inch Roku Pro series TV we tested offers above-average brightness for a more budget-focused set \u2013 we measured around 900 nits peak brightness on a 10% window pattern and over 400 nits on a fullscreen pattern. While those are far from the most impressive numbers we\u2019ve seen on a mini-LED TV, they compare well to competition at the same kind of official price. The Pro series also has excellent color performance and, as we noted in our review, we \u201cdidn\u2019t experience any backlight blooming thanks to the TV\u2019s well-implemented local dimming.\u201d Its picture also shone with sports, partly because of its above-average brightness for a budget TV, but also because of the very good motion handling provided by its native 120Hz QLED display panel.\nA benefit of the Pro series\u2019 sturdy \u201cshadowbox\u201d frame, which is slighty thicker than normal and was designed to accommodate a wall-mount installation, is that there\u2019s space for side-mounted speakers \u2013 a configuration that allows for better audio clarity than the bottom-mounted speakers on most budget TVs. In our review, we found that there was \u201cplenty of volume on tap\u201d and that you could even get away with not using a soundbar. Which brings up another Pro series benefit: the TV can be wirelessly paired with the company\u2019s wireless soundbars, subwoofers, and surround speakers.\nRoku made its name with streaming devices featuring an intuitive, simple-to-navigate onscreen interface, and that same smart interface is provided on Pro series TVs. Along with providing easy access to your favorite streaming apps, picture and sound settings can be quickly accessed by pressing the star button on the Pro\u2019s remote control, which also has a built-in mic for voice commands. Roku had also promised a new feature called Roku Backdrops that\u2019s similar to the \u201cambient\u201d artwork display modes on other smart TVs, though that feature has yet to materialize.\nGaming support on the Pro series is surprisingly robust for a budget TV. It has two HDMI inputs with 4K 120Hz, VRR (with FreeSync), and ALLM support. Input lag in the TV\u2019s game mode is a low 9.4ms, which is the type of performance we see in the best gaming TVs. The Pro series automatically switches to its game picture mode when a gaming console is connected and turned on, and the contrast-rich picture quality also extends to gaming, making it easy to see details in the darker parts of the screen.\nThere are good reasons why the Roku Pro Series is selected as the best budget TV pick in our guide. For less than $900 for the 55-inch model, you\u2019re getting a TV with a bright mini-LED backlight, impressive picture quality and gaming performance, very good built-in sound, great gaming performance and features, and one of the best smart TV interfaces in the biz. And with major sales events now a regular occurrence, you can expect to pay much less than that if you keep your eyes open.\nRoku Pro series test results\nThe best mid-range TV\nSpecifications\n1-minute summary: Hisense is known for its lineup of mini-LED TVs that combine impressive performance with excellent value. The Hisense U8QG best exemplifies this with a picture that\u2019s bright and eye-catching enough that it makes you wonder why you\u2019d need to spend more on flagship TVs from other brands. Available in 55- to 85-inch screen sizes, with a 100-inch model also sold in the US, the U8QG supports both the Dolby Vision and HDR10+ high dynamic range formats and uses the Google TV (VIDAA in the UK and Australia) smart TV system for streaming. A built-in 4.1.2-channel speaker array delivers loud, immersive sound, though, as I found when I reviewed the U8QG, it quickly shows its limitations when tasked with conveying deep bass effects in movies. Gaming is a strong point with the U8QG, which features 4K 165Hz support, along with FreeSync Premium Pro, Dolby Vision, and HDR10+ gaming. It has a sturdy and attractive design with a pedestal stand, though viewers with plenty of sources may find that the TV\u2019s three HDMI 2.1 inputs aren\u2019t enough to connect all their devices.\nRead our full Hisense U8QG review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want to watch in a bright room: The U8QG has excellent brightness, and when that\u2019s combined with its effective anti-reflective screen, you have a TV that works well for bright room viewing.\n\u2705 You want a great TV for movies: Refined local dimming allows the U8QG to deliver powerful contrast and detailed shadows. Also its high brightness reserves lend maximum punch to the highlights in movies and TV shows with HDR.\n\u2705 You want a great TV for gaming: With three HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K 165Hz, FreeSync Premium, and both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ gaming, the U8QG is loaded with gaming features, and the low 9.9ms input lag means gaming is highly responsive.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want to use the TV\u2019s built-in speakers: The U8QG 4.1.2-channel speaker array has powerful, immersive sound, but its built-in subwoofer can audibly distort with some loud action movies. Movie fans will be better off adding a soundbar.\n\u274c You watch lots of broadcast TV: While the U8QG features a built-in ATSC 3.0 tuner for watching NextGen TV broadcasts in the US, its Google TV Live grid guide fails to display info for those channels and you can\u2019t navigate the grid guide\u2019s tuner section.\n\u274c You regularly watch with groups: The U8QG\u2019s picture loses contrast and color saturation when viewing from far off-center seats \u2013 something to be wary of if you like to invite large groups of people over to watch sports.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nMy time spent reviewing the U8QG supports Hisense\u2019s brightness claims for the TV \u2013 it\u2019s easily one of the brightest I\u2019ve measured, beating its U8N predecessor by a fair amount in that regard. It also has a wider color gamut than the U8N, with the result that pictures have consistently rich color. The TV\u2019s refined local dimming ensures that movies have powerful contrast and good shadow detail, and there\u2019s virtually no sign of the backlight \u201cblooming\u201d artifacts that LED-based TVs are prone to. Brightness is high enough that you can watch in well-lit rooms, and the U8QG\u2019s effective anti-reflection screen helps to reduce glare from overhead lights. The main picture quality issue with the U8QG is that it loses contrast and color saturation when viewed from far off-center seats. Motion handling is also just average, with the picture benefiting from custom judder and blur adjustments in the Clarity sub-menu.\nThe U8QG\u2019s 4.1.2-channel, 72W speaker array is one of the biggest enhancements over its Hisense U8N predecessor, which had a 2.1.2-channel built-in speaker array. The TV\u2019s sound is powerful, with clear dialogue, and an impressive level of immersion with Dolby Atmos soundtracks, and there\u2019s a Room Acoustic Tuning feature that uses the mic built into the TV\u2019s remote to automatically tune the sound for your viewing space. While the U8QG\u2019s sound quality is good overall, low-frequency effects in some movie soundtracks can cause the built-in subwoofer to audibly distort, requiring adjustment of the Bass Boost level in the Sound Advanced Settings menu.\nThe U8QG uses the Google TV Smart TV platform in the US and its own VIDAA platform in the UK and elsewhere. Google TV has a relatively uncluttered homescreen that\u2019s easy to navigate, and it supplies every streaming app you could want. There are plentiful settings for picture and sound in the TV\u2019s setup menu, and there\u2019s also a convenient Quick Menu that pops up at the bottom of the screen for making adjustments without having to wade deep through a menu system. The U8QG has a built-in ATSC 3.0 tuner for viewing \u2018NextGen TV\u2019 digital broadcasts in the US, and while Google TV provides a Live Guide for navigating tuned channels, in my testing this feature didn\u2019t work.\nThree HDMI 2.1 ports are provided on the U8QG, and these support a wide range of gaming features such as 4K 165Hz, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, ALLM, Dolby Vision gaming, and HDR10+ gaming. Hisense\u2019s Game Bar menu \u2013 accessible through the TV\u2019s Quick Menu \u2013 lets you easily make gaming-related adjustments while continuing to play the game in the background. The U8QG\u2019s input latency measured in Game mode was 9.9ms \u2013 the best result I\u2019ve yet seen from a Hisense TV, and one that puts it in the company of the best gaming TVs on the market.\nThe price of the 65-inch U8QG that I tested has quickly dropped in the US, making it and other screen sizes, which have also received large discounts, an excellent value given the TV\u2019s features and performance. (Pricing has not been announced in the UK, though I will update this when that information is available.) At a launch cost of $2,199 in the US, the U8QG was initially quite pricey, so if UK prices turn out to be equivalent, it will take its value down a notch.\nHisense U8QG test results\nThe best TV for cheap big-screen thrills\nSpecifications\n1-minute summary: The Hisense U6N is a cheap, mini-LED TV that outshines its budget price tag. It offers a wide array of features and delivers great performance in most areas. Available from 55 to 85 inches, I reviewed the 65-inch model. I was surprised by how good details and texture looking during my testing, taking on a more refined quality than anticipated given the price. Its colors were also dynamic, with plenty of punch. The U6N carries comprehensive HDR support, including both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and it really shone with 4K HDR movies and shows. Although it doesn't carry all the gaming features we look for, limited to 4K at 60Hz rather than 120Hz, I still found gaming to be an enjoyable experience, with VRR and Dolby Vision gaming offering a taste of next-gen. Its sound is on the thin side and I had to make some adjustments to get motion just right for sports \u2013 in particular, the AI Sports mode was too garish, so the best option was the Standard Mode with the Motion preset set to Smooth. But even with that in mind, the U6N's value is undeniable. When you're paying under $1,000 for an 85-inch screen with mini-LED, a good list of gaming features and a solid Google TV smart platform, you won't find much to complain about. I can't recommend the U6N enough for an affordable option.\nRead our full Hisense U6N review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want a big screen without the price tag: The Hisense U6N offers a big screen mini-LED at a bargain price, but without major compromises.\n\u2705 You want a good quality picture in a large sized screen: The U6N has a mini-LED panel that delivers punchy colors, refined details and solid contrast at a cheap price.\n\u2705 You want a solid, budget gaming TV: Although it lacks 4K 120Hz, the U6N does still support 4K 60Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, VRR and ALLM to deliver a good overall gaming experience.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want to avoid using a soundbar: The Hisense U6N does unfortunately suffer from limited sound, with thin-sounding speakers and a narrow soundstage. A soundbar is recommended.\n\u274c You want the best TV for sports: Sports fans will find that they need to make some specific adjustments to settings to improve motion \u2013 and even then, the U6N struggles compared to pricier TVs.\n\u274c You want the complete gaming package: The U6N may be a solid gaming TV, but it doesn't support 4K 120Hz like the best gaming TVs.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nWe tested the 65-inch Hisense U6N and found that while it delivered low peak brightness of 651 nits on a 10% window, its fullscreen brightness, which measured 580 nits, does make it a solid option for daytime viewing. In our review, we were impressed with its level of detail and strong textures, punchy colors and solid contrast. One surprise was its ability to maintain details in clothing during dark scenes, most challenging of which was The Batman. The U6N's picture falters in places, suffering from inconsistent motion and limited viewing angles, as well as black levels sometimes taking on a gray hue. But for the money, the U6N's picture is still leagues above other rival cheap TVs.\nBuilt-in sound is unfortunately one of the Hisense U6N's weakest parts. Its speakers deliver good dialogue clarity and credible bass levels, but struggle in every other area. There's no sense of direction to the speakers and the soundstage is narrow and although Dolby Atmos is supported, it really isn't obvious during viewing. I would recommend a soundbar be used with the U6N, and thanks to its cheap price, it should be easy to add a budget bar in.\nThe U6N comes equipped with Google TV in the US, and I've generally found Google TV to be useful for tailored recommendations of movies and TV shows in the past, but found the large banners ads on the home screen a bit of an eye-sore. I found during testing that the U6N features plenty of picture settings for tweaking the picture and said in my review that \"menus are well laid out and user-friendly, with settings neatly organized\".\nWhile the Hisense U6N does lack some of the major features we look for in the best gaming TVs, such as 4K 120Hz and HDMI 2.1 ports (except for eARC), as I said in my review \"gaming on the U6N is still a fun experience\". Its still very responsive at 4K, 60Hz and has a decent 13.2ms input lag time. There's also VRR, Dolby Vision gaming and ALLM on offer, all of which work effectively to deliver a solid gaming experience. I was also glad to see that the U6N's good picture quality for movies carried over into gaming, displaying the same vibrant colors and refined details.\nValue is where the Hisense U6N shines. Priced at $700 for its 65-inch model, but it's been as low as $549(!) before, you're getting a great TV for a very affordable price. Not to mention that we've seen its 85-inch model for under $1,000, which is a serious bargain for a mini-LED TV with this much to offer. It does face stiff competition from other budget TVs, but there aren't many who offer this great a performance in a larger screen size for less.\nHisense U6N test results\nBest OLED for bright rooms\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-minute summary: Samsung\u2019s flagship OLED TV stood out from its premium OLED TV competition when I tested it by way of its bright picture and its ability to reject screen reflections when viewing in bright rooms. A new, next-gen QD-OLED display panel is responsible for the S95F\u2019s high brightness, while a more effective 2.0 version of the Glare Free screen found on its Samsung S95D predecessor accounts for its impressive bright room performance.\nCombine all that with the S95F\u2019s exceptional picture processing (including AI-based enhancements), razor-thin design (with an external One Connect box for connectivity), and cutting-edge gaming features such as 4K 165Hz support, and the Samsung S95F proves to be an obvious, if pricey, choice for as the best TV for viewing and gaming in bright rooms.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You\u2019re viewing in a bright room: The S95F\u2019s Glare Free screen is highly effective at eliminating reflections, making it a great choice for viewing in a room with bright lighting.\n\u2705 You want exceptional picture quality: The S95F\u2019s picture has spectacular color, contrast, brightness, and detail, and that level of picture quality remains consistent across a range of room lighting conditions.\n\u2705 You want an OLED TV for gaming: Not only does the S95F display great picture quality for movies and TV, but it also has impressive gaming performance, with smooth, responsive action and ultra-low input lag.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want a TV with Dolby Vision HDR: The S95F supports the HDR10+ high dynamic range format, but not the more widespread Dolby Vision format.\n\u274c You want to save money: The S95F is Samsung\u2019s flagship OLED TV, and has a premium price tag to match.You can find other OLED TVs for less, but they won\u2019t have the same level of bright room performance.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to mess with picture settings: The S95F\u2019s Filmmaker Mode required adjustments to present an accurate picture in bright viewing conditions, something that wasn\u2019t the case with its LG G5 rival when we tested it.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nIn my Samsung S95F review, I called it \u201can overall fantastic TV,\u201d one with powerful contrast, rich colors, and finely rendered details. Unlike many other OLED TVs, its picture quality stands up well in bright rooms, and that\u2019s helped along immensely by Samsung\u2019s effective Glare Free screen. While many other TVs will show at least some degree of mirror-like reflections from room lamps or overhead lights, the S95F eliminates them.\nThe S95F\u2019s color gamut coverage is among the best I\u2019ve ever measured, and its AI-based processing features, such as Real Depth Enhancer, give pictures a near-3D-like quality.\nThe S95F\u2019s 4.2.2 channel, 70W speaker array delivers good overall sound quality with clear speech, and Samsung\u2019s Object Tracking Sound+ feature ensures that sound effects and dialogue are accurately positioned to follow the onscreen action.\nThe TV\u2019s soundstage feels narrow, however, and I experienced some bass buzz when pushing the volume to its highest level. Of course, some of these shortcomings are to be expected from a TV with such a slim design, and the S95F does offer special features that improve sound performance when paired with Samsung\u2019s soundbars.\nThe S95F\u2019s Tizen smart TV interface is among the best available, and improvements have been made to the latest version that introduce compelling new features such as a Daily+ hub and Samsung Art Store, which is a subscription-based service that lets you display famous artworks from a wide range of museums.\nOf course, there\u2019s still Samsung Gaming Hub for cloud-based gaming from apps, including Xbox. A new quick menu is a welcome addition that lets you easily access regularly used picture settings without having to explore menus, and there are also AI picture and sound modes that do all the work for you.\nSamsung TVs typically score high marks for gaming, and the S95F is no exception. The TV\u2019s many gaming features include 4K 165Hz, VRR with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, and ALLM, all supported across four HDMI 2.1 ports. It also has Samsung Gaming Hub, which is a portal for cloud-based gaming from apps such as Xbox, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Luna.\nThe S95F\u2019s ultra-low 9.5ms input lag results in smooth gaming performance, and there was no sign of screen tear during my testing. As I said in my Samsung S95F review, \u201cPlaying Battlefield V, intense combat sequences were exciting to play and targeting was easy, snappy and extremely responsive.\u201d\nThe S95F is undeniably a pricey TV, but this is a case where I feel confident that the performance and features justify the cost. Its price matches up with premium OLED TV rivals such as the LG G5, and competition with that model should lead to price drops from Samsung over time.\nAnother part of the S95F\u2019s value story is its Glare Free screen, which does a better job of eliminating reflections in bright rooms than any other OLED TV on the market. You can find a different OLED TV for less money, but it won\u2019t deliver as consistent a picture in a range of lighting conditions as the S95F.\nSamsung S95F test results\nBest cheap OLED TV\nSpecifications\n1 minute summary: The LG B4 is the best way to get an OLED TV for an affordable price. While I found that it didn't offer the same level of quality, features and performance as its more premium siblings, the C4 and G4, when I tested it, the B4 is no slouch itself. It delivers impressive pictures with plenty of detail and contrast alongside excellent motion handling and dynamic colors. It also comes well-equipped for gaming, with four HDMI 2.1 ports for the first time in the B series' history, which support 4K 120Hz Dolby Vision gaming and more \u2013 and it comes in a new 48-inch size this year. Crucially though, it does all this for less than any other OLED TV and doesn't make too many compromises doing it. I found that it doesn't have the best built-in sound (the Sony Bravia 8 is a better option for that) and you can tell that its brightness is more limited than most other OLEDs, but that doesn't stop the B4 delivering the cinematic contrast that this screen tech is famous for, and I enjoyed watching it a lot \u2013 especially for the price it is.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want OLED's contrast for less: The B4 offers access to an OLED TV for cheaper than any other OLED out there \u2013 and still delivers in key areas.\n\u2705 You want an affordable gaming OLED: It may be a cheaper OLED, but the B4 is still stacked for gaming, with four HDMI 2.1 ports all offering 4K 120Hz and Dolby Vision gaming support.\n\u2705 You want a great smart TV platform: LG's webOS is one of the best out there, delivering top-tier streaming support in a friendly interface, and with very smart quick access to key settings.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You need the best built-in sound: While it delivers on the picture front, the B4's built-in sound is limited, lacking the quality of sets such as the Sony Bravia 8.\n\u274c You want the brightest OLED around: The B4 offers below-average brightness levels compared to other OLEDs, including its mid-range sibling the LG C4.\n\u274c You want the most extensive HDR support: While the B4 does support the popular Dolby Vision format, it does not support HDR10+.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nEquipped with less advanced OLED panel than more expensive models, the LG B4 still manages to deliver great picture quality. In our review, we found the B4 to be accurate in terms of color and contrast, especially when using its Dolby Vision Filmmaker Mode. We also found its motion handling to be excellent. Where it's limited is brightness when compared with more premium OLEDs \u2013 we measured its peak HDR brightness at 656 nits, compared with the step-up LG C4's 1,024 nits. That's a big difference, and you can very much see it. We found this limited brightness to slightly take away from the B4's dynamic picture, but it still delivers the deep, perfectly precise contrast that OLED is famed for, and the lack of brightness is much less of an issue if you watch mostly in controlled lighting environments. At this price, the B4's picture is more than accomplished enough and befitting of an OLED TV \u2013 it's just that will get more if you pay more.\nSound is one of the B4's weaker areas. We found in our review that the B4's speakers have \"decent balance and dialogue comes across clear\", but this is where the best parts end. Dolby Atmos reproduction isn't particularly refined and bass is limited. Pushed to higher volumes, we also found the B4's sound becomes \"a bit thin and edgy\". For those looking for the best built-in sound, look to the Sony Bravia 8. Although the B4's sound \"does the job\", we'd recommend one of the best soundbars to complement the B4's picture.\nEquipped with LG's own smart TV platform, webOS 24, we described the interface as \"one of the best going\" in our review, praising its Quick Cards for easy app organization and navigation. We also really liked the Quick Menu thanks to its convenience for access to useful settings such as picture mode, sound mode and more. The only real negative with webOS is its large banner ad at the top of the home menu, but most smart TV platforms have this today. In terms of smart TV interfaces, not many can compete with webOS \u2013 much to the B4's benefit.\nThe B4 is an excellent option for gaming, especially for those looking for a more affordable OLED. Stocked with four HDMI 2.1 ports, supporting 4K, 144Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, variable refresh rate (including AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G Sync) and auto low-latency mode, the B4 is seriously well equipped for gamers. It also comes with LG's Game Optimizer for easy settings adjustments, including a Boost Mode that drops the B4's input lag to an ultra-low 9.1ms. We were suitably impressed with the B4's gaming prowess.\nThe B4 is a well featured TV for the money, but its value ultimately comes in to question when put up against the step-up LG C4. For the 65-inch model of the B4, the official price is around $1,499 as opposed to $1,599 for the C4, and C4 comes with that brightness boost and faster processing if you can stretch your budget a little. Still though, the B4 is fairly priced for what it offers, and is still the cheapest OLED TV you can get \u2013 and price cuts during the regular sales will bring it down further.\nLG B4 test results\nThe best TV for sports viewing\n7. Samsung QN90F\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\n1 minute summary: The Samsung QN90F is an impressive update on its QN90D predecessor, with a new \u2018Glare Free 2.0\u2019 screen allowing for viewing in bright rooms without any picture quality compromises. This makes it an excellent choice for daytime sports viewing, and a Wide Viewing Angle feature ensures that pictures look good from any seat in the house.\nFor a TV with such a slim design, its 4.2.2-channel built-in speaker system delivers solid performance, and audio-related features such as Object Tracking Sound Pro+ make sound effects and dialogue accurately connect with the onscreen action.\nGamers will find lots to love about the QN95F, which supports 4K 165Hz,\nFreeSync Premium Pro, and Samsung\u2019s Gaming Hub for cloud-based gaming from apps such as Xbox. This TV\u2019s low 9.5ms input lag, meanwhile, means that gameplay is ultra-responsive.\nThe QN90F is priced higher than much of its mini-LED competition, but with its bright, refined picture and Glare Free screen, it\u2019s a perfect all-around option for watching movies and sports, and for gaming.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want a TV for bright rooms: The QN90F has a bright picture, plus its Glare Free tech effectively reduces screen reflections when viewing in bright rooms.\n\u2705 You want a TV that\u2019s great for movies: The QN90F\u2019s powerful contrast and refined local dimming result in pictures with deep and refined shadows when watching movies.\n\u2705 You want a great gaming TV: The QN90F\u2019s HDMI ports with 4K 165 Hz support plus FreeSync Premium and an ultra-low 9.5ms input lag ensure fast and responsive gaming.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want Dolby Vision: The QN90F\u2019s high dynamic range support is limited to the HDR10+, HDR10, and HLG formats.\n\u274c You want the best value TV: Brands like Hisense and TCL also offer mini-LED TVs with high brightness and impressive overall picture quality for less money.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nThe QN90F\u2019s high brightness levels (I measured 2,086 nits peak brightness in Movie mode) and Glare Free screen allow for pictures to pop even in well-lit rooms. That, plus the TV\u2019s Wide Viewing Angle feature, makes it a perfect TV for sports viewing, and one that also looks great when gaming. Motion handling is also excellent on QN90F, which is another important consideration for sports.\nWhile it's a great TV for sports, the QN90F\u2019s finely controlled local dimming also has benefits for movies, especially 4K ones with HDR. Like other Samsung TVs, the QN90F doesn\u2019t support the Dolby Vision HDR format, but its NQ4 AI Gen3 Processor and 4K AI Upscaling Pro and Auto HDR Remastering Pro features ensure that all manner of standard and 4K high dynamic range pictures look good.\nThe QN90F\u2019s built-in 4.2.2-channel speaker system delivers clear and well-balanced sound and a good sense of \u201cheight\u201d with Dolby Atmos soundtracks. Bass is on the light side \u2013 something to be expected from such a slim TV \u2013 and the soundstage is mostly limited to the screen, but the TV\u2019s Object Tracking Sound Pro+ feature ensures that sound effects accurately track the onscreen action, while Active Voice Amplifier Pro helps dialogue to cut through even frenetic action movie scenes. The QN90F also supports Q-Symphony, a feature that lets you combine its built-in speakers with those in a compatible Samsung soundbar for enhanced sound.\nThe latest version of Samsung\u2019s Tizen smart TV system in the QN90F is the best one yet, with a wide range of new lifestyle-oriented apps and compatibility with the Samsung Art Store, a feature previously only supported by Samsung The Frame TVs. A Live program grid conveniently combines free-to-stream Samsung TV Plus channels with live broadcast TV channels pulled in by the QN90F\u2019s ATSC 3.0 tuner (US only). A new Quick Menu option lets you easily access picture, sound and other settings that can otherwise be buried deep in the QN90F\u2019s menu system, and it also allows for a degree of customization based on the user\u2019s preferences.\nWith an ultra-low 9.5ms input lag, the QN90F provides highly responsive gaming, and its four HDMI 2.1 ports support up to 4K 165Hz for PC gaming. Other key gaming features include FreeSync Premium Pro and HGiG, and Samsung\u2019s Gaming Hub features apps such as Xbox, Nvidia GeForce Now, Boosteroid, and Luna. Compared to its mini-LED TV competition, the QN90F provides a superior gaming experience, and its excellent overall picture quality gives games a cinematic feel.\nThe QN90F costs more than many of its mini-LED competitors, but also delivers more on many fronts, from design to features, picture quality, and gaming performance. Prices for the QN90F series have dropped since the initial release, and Samsung offers regular limited-time discounts, so you should be able to find one at a more reasonable price. The QN90F is also available in smaller 50- and 43-inch screen sizes, which tend to be more affordable.\nSamsung QN90F test results\nThe best TV for sound\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-minute summary: Panasonic\u2019s Z95A is the company\u2019s flagship OLED TV, and a triumphant return to the US market for the brand. Available only in a 65-inch size in the US, it uses the same micro lens array (MLA) panel found in the LG G4 OLED, and like that model, achieves impressive brightness peaks for an OLED TV. Equally notable is the Z95A\u2019s built-in 5.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos speaker array. This 160W system uses separate left, center, and right channel speakers, along with a pair of upfiring ones, to deliver an almost unmatched sense of sound immersion for a TV. We usually recommend using a soundbar for all TVs, but in the Z95A\u2019s case, the sound is good enough that you can easily get by without using one. Even with discounts since its initial release, the Panasonic Z95A is still very much a premium-priced TV, but its excellent picture and sound performance make it a compelling all-in-one home theater option.\nRead our full Panasonic Z95A review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want to watch in bright rooms\nThe Z95A\u2019s picture is bright enough to hold up in bright rooms, and its anti-reflection screen also helps in those environments by reducing screen glare.\n\u2705 You want powerful built-in sound\nWith a built-in 5.1.2-channel, 160W speaker system, the Z95A is about as well-equipped on the sound front as TVs get. It\u2019s good enough that you won\u2019t need a soundbar.\n\u2705 You want comprehensive HDR support\nThe Z95A is one of the few OLED TVs you can buy that supports both the Dolby Vision and HDR10+ high dynamic range formats.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want the best gaming TV\nThe Z95A has a good selection of gaming features, but it\u2019s limited to two HDMI ports and there are no built-in cloud gaming options such as you\u2019ll find on Samsung and LG TVs.\n\u274c You want a great smart TV interface\nThe Amazon Fire TV interface used by the Z95A is an improvement on the one used in earlier Panasonic TVs, but it has a busy layout, and the Fire TV remote control that\u2019s bundled with it is disappointingly flimsy given the TV\u2019s price.\n\u274c You already have a soundbar\nAlongside its bright picture, the Z95A\u2019s flagship feature is its powerful built-in sound. If you don\u2019t need that feature, there are other, less pricey OLED TV options.\nShow full expert analysis \u25bc\nIn-depth analysis\nWith its MLA OLED panel, the Z95A is one of the brightest OLED TVs you can buy, matching the impressive brightness of the LG G4 when we measured it. It\u2019s only bested in that regard by the Samsung S95D elsewhere in this guide, and the Z95A\u2019s anti-reflection screen coating similarly makes it a great choice for bright room viewing. The Z95A\u2019s Filmmaker Mode picture preset delivers highly accurate picture quality out of the box, though its Normal preset will be a better option for viewing content like sports. (There\u2019s also a special Netflix Calibrated picture mode for subscribers to that streaming service.) In our review, we noted that the Z95A\u2019s \u201cbold, detailed color reproduction is beautiful for movies.\u201d Its contrast and black detail are also everything you\u2019d expect from a flagship OLED TV, with even the darkest TV shows and movies looking detailed and clear.\nWe\u2019ve selected the Z95A as the best TV for sound in this guide for a good reason: few TVs can even approach the power and clarity of its built-in 5.1.2-channel, 160W speaker system. The sound here is good enough that you won\u2019t even need to use a soundbar, and there\u2019s even good bass \u2013 a difficult feat for a TV to pull off. In our Z95A review, we noted that \u201cAtmos soundtracks have a true sense of spaciousness,\u201d giving effects like falling rain a convincing sense of height. We also appreciated the Z95A\u2019s sophisticated audio processing, which includes a Space Tune feature that effectively equalizes the TV\u2019s sound output for your room, and Sound Focus, which adjusts the directionality of sound to compensate for off-center seating.\nThe Z95A uses Amazon Fire TV as its smart TV platform. The UI is generally busy, but there is comprehensive streaming app support, and plenty of content recommendations that are particularly relevant to Amazon Prime subscribers and users of its Freevee free TV portal. A Live screen lets you populate the program guide grid with channels pulled in by the TV\u2019s built-in ATSC 3.0 tuner, and a Fire TV Ambient experience can be set up to display artworks, photos, and even AI-generated images when the TV is in standby mode. Panasonic provides an extensive range of picture and sound settings in the TV\u2019s menus, something that is good news for tweakers, though viewers who prefer a simpler, set-and-forget experience may find it off-putting.\nGaming support on the Z95A includes 4K 144Hz, VRR (including Nvidia G-Sync and AMD Freesync Premium), and Dolby Vision gaming (up to 144Hz). That\u2019s a comprehensive set of gaming features, and while the Z95A only has two HDMI 2.1 ports, that shouldn\u2019t pose a problem for dual console gamers since the TV\u2019s built-in sound is good enough that you won\u2019t need a third HDMI 2.1 port to connect a soundbar. A Game Control Board pop-up menu lets you easily adjust gaming-related settings on the Z95A, which has a low 12.9ms input lag when in Game mode.\nAt its current price, the Panasonic Z95A is a good value for an OLED TV this feature-packed. You\u2019ll spend around the same amount for other premium OLED TVs such as the Samsung S95D and LG G4 in a 65-inch screen size, and those won\u2019t have the Z95A\u2019s powerful built-in speaker array. That\u2019s the key thing that increases the value of Panasonic\u2019s flagship OLED TV, since you won\u2019t necessarily have to buy a soundbar, which, depending on the model, can add quite a bit to the total price.\nSony Bravia 8 test results\nThe best TVs 2025: comparison charts\nHere's a summary of our scores for the key areas we rate TV in \u2013 you can read more about each TV's individual scores in their respective entries in this guide. You can sort the table above by the different categories by clicking the column headers.\nWe measure the objective performance of TVs using as part of our testing process, using these figures to help us make a judgment on the picture quality that we're seeing. The following measurements were all taken by our labs or testers, using professional-level equipment and software. You shouldn't judge a TV based solely on test numbers, but it can be useful to make quick comparisons between them while decided what to buy, so here are the results for all the TVs we rate here together. First is brightness, measured using both HDR and SDR video, in small areas and fullscreen (which makes a big difference).\nHere are our test results for measuring how close the TVs come to supporting 100% of the P3 color range, which used in HDR video. The BT.2020 range is also used in pro video work, but is less important in general use.\nInput lag is the time it from when an image enters the TVs HDMI port, to when it appears on-screen. This is important for gaming, because you want action to happen immediately after you press the button, not with a delay. We measure it using a piece of specialist equipment that rapid-fires a blinking image on the screen, and detects the delay.\nMore TVs to consider\nLG G4: A fantastic TV that delivers phenomenal picture quality and LG's brightest-ever OLED images by a major margin. It's very hard to fault as a TV\u2026 but we prefer the Samsung S95D, which is why that's in this list as the best premium OLED. The S95D has an anti-reflective coating that makes it more versatile, as well as its One Connect box for a sleeker design, and a better built-in sound system. But you should read our five-star LG G4 review because it really is a special TV.\nTCL QM851G: TCL\u2019s top TV offers much of the same picture performance and features as our best mid-range selection, the Hisense U8N. The main reason it didn\u2019t make the cut for our guide is it\u2019s only available in a 65-inch and up screen size, while the U8N has a 55-inch size option. In our TCL QM851G review, we admired its very bright and punchy picture, and also its clean upscaling of lower-resolution sources. It\u2019s also a great TV for sound, with a powerful Onkyo-designed 80-watt, 2.1.2-channel speaker system.\nSamsung Q60D: Samsung's cheapest QLED is a good-looking TV that we said offers \"refined detail\" and \"better than expected contrast\" in our review, given that it doesn't use mini-LED tech. For its low price, it's a rich, enjoyable image\u2026 but the pressure is really on it from the likes of the Roku Pro Series in this list or the Hisense U6N, which both offer a big step up in brightness and contrast for not a lot more money. We liked using this TV, but as we said in our full Samsung Q60D review, \"it faces tough competition from budget mini-LED TVs that offer more gaming features and better pictures for a similar price.\"\nSamsung QN85D: Ah, the poor QN85D. A perfectly lovely TV that simply pales in comparison to the better value and ridiculous brightness of the TCL QM851G and the Hisense U8N when it comes to movies and sports. Having said that, gamers might choose the QN85D over these models, because of its four HDMI 2.1 ports, all equipped for 4K 120Hz gaming with variable refresh rate. So if you've got both next-gen consoles and a soundbar, it gives you the connection flexibility that the TCL and Hisense lack. And it's a great TV in general, as our full Samsung QN85D review explains \u2013 it's just that for non-gaming use, the rival mini-LEDs offer better bang for your buck.\nAmazon Fire TV Omni Mini-LED: Amazon\u2019s top Fire TV model is a relative bargain for what if offers, with good overall picture quality and impressive gaming specs (including 4K 144Hz support) and performance, as we noted in our Amazon Fire TV Omni Mini-LED review. It would be a leading contender to replace the Roku Pro Series TV as the best budget option in this guide if the Roku also didn\u2019t have good picture quality and gaming performance, plus great sound quality and physical design. The cluttered Fire TV interface also takes a backseat to Roku, which is among the cleanest and easiest-to-navigate smart TV interfaces around. All that said, the Omni Mini-LED can be had for an attractive price, especially during big sales events like Amazon\u2019s own Prime Day.\nHisense U9N: Hisense\u2019s flagship mini-LED TV offers even better picture and sound quality than the Hisense U8N, our pick for the best mid-range TV in this guide. Why didn\u2019t the U9N make the cut? Because the Hisense U8N is also a seriously impressive TV, and it can be found for substantially cheaper than the U9N. Even so, in our Hisense U9N review, we noted its superior overall performance compared to the U8N, especially its local dimming and exceptional color gamut coverage, which measured 98.9% for UHD-P3 and 81.5% for BT.2020 in Filmmaker Mode, results that \u201cbest other premium mini-LED TVs we\u2019ve tested.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt that the U9N is a great TV; it\u2019s just pricey compared to the also great U8N.\nNew TVs coming in 2025\nMany new TVs were announced a the CES 2025 trade show in Las Vegas, and we fully expect to see some of them added to this guide as they become available to us for review over the course of the year. LG announced the LG C5, the successor to the LG C4 that serves as our current top pick. We have favorably reviewed the LG C5, but have also determined that it offers only an incremental improvement on the C4, which remains our top pick for this guide.\nSamsung announced two new OLED TV series: the S95F, a flagship model that features next-gen Glare Free screen tech that has since been added to this guide, and the mid-range S90F. The company also announced a range of mini-LED and regular LED TVs. These include two 8K series, the QN990F and QN900F, with the former getting the same Glare Free screen as the S95F OLED along with a new 8K wireless One Connect Box for a wireless connection from sources, with support for 8K 120Hz at up to 10 meters. Samsung\u2019s top 4K mini-LED model for 2025 will be the QN90F, which will also get a Glare Free screen plus 165Hz support for gaming, and it will be accompanied by the mid-range QN80F series and entry-level QN70F series mini-LED TVs.\nOther brands showing new TVs at CES include TCL, which announced its QM6K mini-LED Series. The company says that the new TVs will be significantly brighter than last year\u2019s models and feature 144Hz refresh rate along with 288Hz VRR support for gaming. Hisense announced the 116\u201d TriChroma LED TV, a high-end model with a 116-inch screen size and a new RGB mini-LED backlight that\u2019s said to be capable of 10,000 nits peak brightness. Both TCL and Hisense will be announcing additional TV series as we get deeper into 2025.\nFinally, Panasonic unveiled a new Z95B OLED TV with a 'Primary RGB Tandem Panel\u2019 that uses similar tech as the new LG G5 OLED. Unlike last year\u2019s Z95A, which was only available in a 65-inch size, it will be sold in 55-, 65- and 77-inch sizes and features a re-designed sound system tuned by Panasonic\u2019s sister brand Technics. It also announced the W95B series, which it says has an improved mini-LED panel with up to 2.5x more dimming zones compared to last year's W95A, along with a new entry-level W70B LED TV series.\nThe best TV brands 2025\nThe best TV brand landscape has shifted somewhat over the past few years, with top brands shifting places to a degree on the power rankings chart, and upstart brands such as Hisense and TCL gaining traction. Along with these, we saw the re-introduction of Panasonic to the US TV market in 2024, along with new TV brands like Roku and Amazon putting out increasingly higher-quality sets. What follows is a summary of the various TV brands ordered according to their performance in TechRadar\u2019s TV tests.\nJudged by its overall performance in TechRadar\u2019s recent TV reviews, Samsung is the leading TV brand, scoring two each 5-star, 4.5-star, and 4-star overall ratings in reviews we\u2019ve conducted over the past year. We rate Samsung TVs highly for their picture quality, though we regularly cite the lack of Dolby Vision HDR support as a downside. Samsung TVs are also the strongest when it comes to gaming performance and features, and each yearly iteration introduces new cutting-edge design innovations.\nLG scored one 5-star, two 4.5-star, and one 4-star overall ratings in our TV reviews last year, trailing directly behind Samsung. Like Samsung TVs, LG TVs earn strong praise for picture quality and features in our reviews, and they also provide one of the best smart TV platforms in webOS. Gaming performance and features are also regularly cited in our LG TV reviews, though the company lags behind competitors when it comes to mini-LED TV development, leaning instead on OLED for its top TV brand status.\nSony shifted its focus from OLED to mini-LED tech for its flagship TVs last year, managing to earn one five-star and two 4.5-star overall ratings in our reviews. The company\u2019s flagship TVs are the ones that provide the best picture quality, though they are generally pricier than equivalent flagship models from Samsung and LG. Sony TVs also provide excellent built-in sound quality, though they lag behind the competition when it comes to gaming features and performance despite providing PS5-centric settings.\nHisense and TCL fit into the middle of our overall TV brand rankings, with Hisense edging out TCL with two 4.5-star and two 4-star overall ratings in our reviews last year. Both brands provide a range of high-value TVs with the top models providing excellent overall picture quality and sound quality. Performance tends to drop as you move down the range for each respective brand, however, and the gaming features on their TVs aren\u2019t as extensive as what you\u2019ll get from Samsung and LG.\nLast but not necessarily least, Roku and Amazon both made good showings in our recent reviews, with Roku scoring one 4.5-star and Amazon one 4-star overall rating. Both of these were for the company\u2019s first mini-LED TVs, which offer impressive picture quality at a budget price. We generally praise Roku TVs for their excellent smart TV interface, which is easy on the eyes and intuitive to navigate, while Amazon Fire TVs earn marks for good overall performance and high value.\nHow to choose the best TV for you\nThere are lots of complicated terms you'll see when buying a new TV, including in this guide \u2013 so to start our generlized buying advice, here's a glossary of the big terms you'll see often.\n120Hz/144Hz: This is the \u2018refresh rate\u2019 of the TV, meaning how many image frames it can show each second. 120Hz means 120 frames per second maximum. Classified as high frame rate (HFR), 120Hz is ideal for next-gen gaming consoles such as PS5 and Xbox Series X, and can also benefit sports viewing. While consoles are capped at 120Hz, some TVs can support 144Hz for PC gaming.\n4K: Also known as Ultra HD (UHD), a 4K image consists of roughly 4,000 horizontal pixels \u2013 3,840 in the UHD standard specs used by streamers and 4K Blu-ray, to be precise \u2013 by 2,160 vertical pixels, which is four times the amount found in Full HD TVs. Most streaming services now support 4K as do most 43-inches and larger TVs.\nALLM (auto low latency mode): A feature primarily used for gaming where a TV will switch to the optimal game picture mode/settings when it detects a connected gaming console.\nATSC 3.0: Also known as \u201cNextGen TV,\u201d it is a broadcast TV standard created by the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) that supports 4K resolution, high dynamic range, and immersive audio formats such as Dolby Atmos. ATSC is used by broadcast TV stations in the US, and it requires a TV with an ATSC 3.0-compatible tuner.\nARC: Audio Return Channel. This feature allows for audio signals to be sent from a TV to an HDMI ARC-supported device such as a soundbar or AV receiver via an HDMI connection.\nBacklight: The light source that sits behind the display panel in an LED-based TV. Various backlight types include edge-lit, direct, and full-array.\nColor gamut: The range of colors that can be displayed by a device within a particular color space such as REC.709, BT.2020 and UHDA-P3. Supporting a wider color gamut means the TV should be able show images closer to the original material.\nDirect backlight: A type of backlight that sits directly behind a TV\u2019s panel. Direct backlights can offer better dimming control and black uniformity (the ability to display black tones evenly across a screen) than edge-lit backlights\nDolby Vision: A High Dynamic Range (HDR) format that\u2019s used to dynamically optimize image contrast on a scene-by-scene or frame-by-frame basis . Dolby Vision is widely used in movie theaters, 4K Blu-ray releases, streaming services and video games.\nDolby Atmos: A 3D sound format that incorporates height channels to create a dome-like immersive effect. Dedicated speakers produce the most authentic Atmos sound, though some soundbars and built-in TV speakers can produce good \u2018virtual\u2019 Atmos sound as well.\neARC: Enhanced Audio Return Channel. An improved version of HDMI ARC that allows for transmission of higher-quality, uncompressed Dolby and DTS audio formats over HDMI from a TV.\nFull Array Backlight: An advanced backlight design that improves local dimming by partitioning the backlight into small zones, each of which can have their light levels controlled individually. This results in better contrast, higher brightness and reduced backlight blooming effects.\nHDMI: A cable standard used to transmit audio and video from a source to a display device. It stands for High Definition Multimedia Interface, and is the standard connector for TVs now.\nHDMI 2.1: The latest HDMI version, and one that allows for transmission of higher-quality, uncompressed Dolby and DTS audio formats, 8K video, and higher video frame rates such as 4K at 120Hz for gaming.\nHDR: High Dynamic Range. A video format that allows for images with improved brightness, contrast and color detail. Most newer TVs support some format of HDR, which is used for video games, 4K Blu-ray discs and streaming services.\nHDR10: A common, widely used HDR format on 4K Blu-ray players, game consoles, TVs and streaming services.Basically any TV device with HDR will support this\nHDR10+: A less commonly supported HDR format with similar capabilities as Dolby Vision. HDR10+ is supported by TVs from Samsung, Panasonic, TCL, and Hisense, and is used by streaming services such as Prime Video.\nHLG: Hybrid-Log Gamma. A HDR format developed by the BBC and NHK broadcasting services that was designed to simultaneously transmit both SDR and HDR signals. It is used for live HDR broadcasting, and is supported on effectively every TV.\nInput lag: The time delay between a video or audio signal being sent and actioned by a relevant device. In the case of TVs, it refers to the time between when the TV receives an image from, say, a games console, and when that image is shown on-screen. Input lag is measured in milliseconds (ms), with the lower the number the better. This specification particularly is useful in gaming, where a measurement below 15ms is considered optimal.\nLocal Dimming: LED and mini-LED TVs with full array backlights may dim darker areas on the screen and accentuate brighter areas, resulting in better contrast by using this \u2018localized\u2019 dimming.\nMini-LED: A backlight tech that uses small, almost microscopic LEDs for more efficient and improved dimming and lighting performance over regular LED backlights.\nNits (brightness): A unit of measurement used to evaluate brightness. The peak brightness of LED TVs is typically around 500 nits, QLED TVs roughly 1,000 nits, OLED TVs between 600 and 1500 nits, and mini-LED TVs may hit 2,000-plus nits.\nNeo QLED: Samsung\u2019s name for its range of mini-LED TVs, which combine a QLED display panel with a mini-LED backlight.\nOLED: Organic Light Emitting Diode. A type of display panel that contains self-emitting pixels that generate their own light, eliminating the need for a backlight. OLED TVs typically have deeper, more accurate black levels than other TV types, because they can dim the light from each pixel individually\nQLED: Quantum Light Emitting Diode. An LED display panel with a coating of \u2018nanocrystals\u2019 that can achieve higher brightness and brighter, more vivid colors than the ones used in standard LED TVs.\nSDR: Standard Dynamic Range. A video production and display standard with more limited brightness, contrast and color gamut coverage compared to HDR. Anything from before the HDR era can be considered SDR.\nVRR (variable refresh rate): A tech used primarily in gaming where the display will adjust its frame rate to match the rate of the source device, such as a console or PC, to avoid judder and screen-tearing effects. VRR is particularly useful during high frame rate gaming.\nHow do I choose the best TV for me?\nThere are tons of things you could consider when buying a new TV, but not everyone needs to get stuck in the technological weeds. Here's the advice our editors tend to give the (many) people who ask this of them in real life.\nFirst, set your budget and your size. Choose a maximum amount you're willing to spend, and the size of TV you want, and then narrow your search to only models that fit both of those criteria. You will find that already you're down to looking at only a handful of options, making it much easier to get a grip on things. If you have quite a high budget, set yourself a minimum budget too to help narrow things \u2013 maybe 30% below your maximum budget.\nWhen considering the size of the TV, think about where you'll be installing it; it can make all the difference if you're using one of the best TV wall mounts to mount your TV, or just placing it on a stand, as the same TV can look different on both these places.\nSo now you'll need to make a few further decisions. If you're looking at the mid-range or premium end of things, do you want an OLED TV or an LED/mini-LED TV? In sizes 55 inches and up, LED TVs tend to be brighter than OLEDs, and so are great for watching sports or TV during the day in bright rooms. But for movie nights, OLED TVs are the best, thanks to their unrivaled contrast \u2013 they just don't go as bright as LED TVs unless you get the most expensive models.\nIf you're buying a mid-range set, you'll need to decide if you need a 120Hz screen or not. This is great for gamers (especially those with a PS5 or Xbox Series X), and also good for movies because it can show more natural motion. But if you want to save cash, getting a 60Hz TV might be a better idea, because 120Hz TVs always cost more.\nAnd then, spare a thought to sound. Most of today's thin TVs have weak built-in sound. If you don't mind buying one of the best soundbars too (or if you already have one), then don't worry about this. But if you don't want extra boxes in your setup, then focus on the TVs we've recommended where we mention the audio is stronger. Sadly, it tends to be higher-end sets that do this better \u2013 but even then, not all are created equal. Sony and Samsung are usually strong for audio, though, so are a good place to start.\nWhich TV is the best quality?\nThat depends on how you define quality. We define it as the ultimate mix of picture quality, features, design and price \u2013 when recommending the TV that's best for most people at any given price, that's what we're looking for. And that's why the Samsung S90C is at the top of our list \u2013 some TVs do individual things better, but nothing else does so much stuff so well, for the same kind of price (thanks to price cuts, because it's a TV from 2023).\nThe best premium OLED on the market for us is the Samsung S95D, which is an extremely high-end option, but is worth every penny when you see the results from its super-bright screen combined with its amazing anti-reflection panel.\nWhich brand is best for TVs in 2025?\nNo one brand does TVs better than the others, but there are definitely some TV makers that excel in certain areas more than their rivals.\nSome of the best brands on our list are Hisense, LG, Samsung, Sony, and TCL. They all tend to be the top-performing brands at the premium end, though all bring out a wide range of models each year.\nLG also makes excellent OLED TVs \u2013 in fact, LG Display makes the OLED panels for most other brands. We like that LG offers a wide range of TVs, including different budgets and sizes \u2013 the LG C4 goes from 42 inches all the way up to 83 inches and delivers on every front, and that's why it's at the top this list. LG's webOS is one of our favorite smart TV platforms, and is an easy to use operating system that feels intuitive. LG's LED TVs aren't great value, though, again compared to Hisense and TCL.\nWith steps into the QD-OLED world, Samsung has established itself as a real contender for best OLED TVs, with the also impressive Samsung S95D offering incredible picture quality and performance. There are also Samsung's dynamic mini-LEDs available that will suit most people with bright environments, though Hisense and TCL have these models beaten for sheer value in 2025.\nSony is another major player in the TV space. Its screens boast stunning picture quality and build quality. Although, like other brands in this list, there's a wide range across the board. Sony's TVs tend to cost a premium compared to the other brands here for the same kind of features, except Sony's TVs contain some of the best built-in sound in the business, so you do get something extra for that price.\nHisense and TCL are the two makers who've really crashed the party, producing mini-LED TVs for unbelievably good prices that deliver astounding brightness and impressive contrast, with good features. They both use Google TV as their smart platform, which makes them fairly easy to use and ensures all the key streaming services are there.\nWhich is better OLED or QLED?\nThis is one of the biggest and more contentious TV tech questions of the moment. Luckily we've covered all of the details in our OLED vs QLED guide.\nHowever, if you're looking for a summary we'd say that QLED is a great option for brightness if you'll watch in bright, sunlit conditions; whereas OLED TVs offer better viewing angles and superior contrast for gorgeous movie-like images, as long as you can control the room lighting.\nIs 4K better than OLED?\nLuckily, you don't need to decide whether to go with OLED or 4K \u2013 you can have both! 4K refers to the resolution (ie, the number of pixels on the screen), while OLED refers to the panel technology (ie, what the pixels are made from).\nSo you can have 4K screens that are OLED (almost all of them are, apart from some pricey 8K OLED TVs), and you can have 4K screens that are QLED, mini-LED or other tech.\nIs LG better than Samsung?\nBoth LG and Samsung are excellent TV brands and you can't really go wrong with either when it comes to OLED, but it's a different matter outside of that.\nLG's LED TVs are notably a weaker proposition than Samsung's, so if you're thinking of going for a budget TV or a mini-LED model, Samsung is the better bet of these two.\nWhen it comes to OLED TVs, we rate Samsung's S95D marginally ahead of the LG G4 equivalent thanks to its anti-reflection screen, but if you mostly watch in controlled lighting, the LG G4 is just as good.\nWe love the LG C4's versatility, coming in many different sizes and with every gaming feature you could want \u2013 it's a great mid-range model. But at the moment, we recommend the Samsung S90C over it because they're about the same for picture quality and key features, but the Samsung TV is a year older, and so has received many more price drops \u2013 it's better value.\nHow we test the best TVs\nEach TechRadar TV review involves a series of objective tests made using specialized test equipment. These are combined with extensive subjective evaluation using both test patterns and real-world sources such as 4K Blu-ray, streamed content, and broadcast TV.\nFor our objective tests, we measure a TV\u2019s peak and fullscreen brightness levels, along with its HDR color gamut coverage. We also measure color and grayscale accuracy, as well as input lag for gaming.\nAfter determining a TV\u2019s most accurate picture preset using objective tests, our subjective evaluation will be performed with that preset active to make a general assessment of picture quality, taking into account factors such as contrast, black level, screen uniformity, color, detail, and more. We also assess sound quality, features, design, smart TV and menus, gaming features and performance, and value, with individual scores for each section contributing to an overall rating.\nYou can get a fully detailed overview of our process in How we test TVs at TechRadar.\nLatest updates to our guide to the best TVs\nJuly 29, 2025\nReplaced the Samsung S95D with the Samsung S95F, a new model with an improved Glare Free screen, as 'Best OLED for bright rooms' option.\nJuly 1, 2025\nReplaced Samsung QN90D with newer model, Samsung QN90F, as 'Best TV for sports' option.\nMay 28, 2025\nReplaced Hisense U8N with a newer model, the Hisense U8QG, as 'Best mid-range' option.\nRead more updates\nApril 29, 2025\nReplaced Sony Bravia 8 with Panasonic Z95A OLED as 'Best for sound.'\nApril 1, 2025\nAdded Quick List for easier guide navigation.\nMarch 12, 2025\nAdded the Amazon Fire TV Omni Mini-LED and Hisense U9N to 'Also consider' section.\nFebruary 14, 2025\nAdded 'Best TV brands' section with ranked assessments of TV brands TechRadar has reviewed over the past year.\nJanuary 15, 2025\nAdded 'New TVs coming in 2025' section with details on new TV models announced at the CES 2025 tradeshow.\nDecember 24, 2024\nRemoved the Samsung S90C due to falling stock levels.

Here are our top picks\nThe best OLED TVs on the market today deliver beautiful image quality thanks to the self-lighting pixels that define this technology. What these pixels deliver are stunningly deep black tones and incredibly precise contrast between light and dark areas, in a way that LED or mini-LED TVs simply cannot match. Read our 'What is OLED?' guide for more on why this tech is such a big upgrade, and so sought-after.\nThe best OLED TVs include a lot of models that rank among the best TVs overall, and come from the biggest TV brands, such as LG and Sony. Even Samsung \u2013 a TV company that had rejected OLED for years, has not only joined the party, but has topped our rankings here at times.\nOur picks of the best OLED TVs here aren't just ranked from the best-looking to the weakest, because that would put all the most expensive ones at the top.

A new processor with a Brightness Booster feature is largely responsible for the picture quality step-up, yielding improved brightness along with better HDR handling and color detail. The C4 series is available in a wide range of sizes \u2013 from 42 inches up to 83 inches \u2013 which makes it an ideal option for everything from desktop gaming to home theater. I enjoyed watching movies on the C4 greatly, and particularly appreciated its new Dolby Vision Filmmaker Mode picture preset, which makes it super-easy to watch in the most cinematic way, which is what I'll always favor. It\u2019s also a gaming powerhouse, with four HDMI 2.1 ports with 4K 120Hz pass-through and the latest gaming tech. Whether it\u2019s for gaming, movies, or anything else, I found the LG C4 is a great all-purpose TV. When it comes to features and performance vs price, the LG C4 is tough to beat. We've now tested ts successor, the LG C5, and while it's a best-in-class TV, the C4 is still better value while it's around, thanks to huge price drops. Expect to see the C5 here in future though.\nRead our full LG C4 review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want a versatile OLED TV: With a vivid, detailed picture, great gaming features and an array of sizes, the C4 covers a lot of bases.\n\u2705 You want an ideal TV for movies: With improved contrast and detail and a new Dolby Vision Filmmaker Mode, the C4 is perfect for movies.\n\u2705 You want a great gaming TV: The C4's impressive picture extends to games, and its four HDMI 2.1 ports have a suite of features for console and PC gaming.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You need the best built-in audio: The C4's audio doesn't live up to the same level of its picture quality \u2013 the Samsung S95D, LG G5 and Panasonic Z95A are better.\n\u274c You want the brightest OLED available: While the C4 is much brighter than LG B4, the more premium Samsung S95D and LG G5 offers higher brightness still.\n\u274c You want the least expensive OLED: LG's new B4 OLED TV doesn't come in as many sizes, and isn't as good overall, but it's available at a lower price than the C4.\nIn-depth analysis\nWe measured the LG C4\u2019s peak HDR brightness at 1,065 nits \u2013 a substantial boost over last year\u2019s C3. This brightness increase helps to bring out the full range of detail in 4K movies with HDR and also makes colors look \"startingly vivid\", as we said in our review. OLED TVs generally excel at delivering deep and detailed shadows, and the C4 more than holds its own in that regard. The picture on OLED TVs also looks uniform over a wide viewing angle, and that quality will benefit larger C4 screen sizes when watching with a large group.\nThe LG C4 can upmix basic movie and TV soundtracks for a virtual 9.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos presentation \u2013 but still only from a limited set of speakers. In our review, we found dialogue on the C4 to be clear and that there was also a good degree of spaciousness when the TV\u2019s AI Sound Pro mode was active. Bass is constrained, making a soundbar a recommended option. If you do go that route, the C4 has several features designed to work specifically with LG soundbars, including Wow Orchestra, which combines the TV\u2019s built-in audio with the soundbar\u2019s speakers, and Wow Cast, which transmits lossless Dolby Atmos soundtracks wirelessly from the TV to the soundbar. Basically, the built-in sound here is clear, but doesn't match the scale of the pictures fully.\nLG\u2019s webOS 24 smart TV interface on the C4 has a streamlined look, with a prominently featured Quick Cards section that makes it easy to see options for storing apps and accessing settings in the Games, Music, Home Hub, Sports, and Home Office categories. There are also content recommendations, although a fair number of these are meant to steer you to the LG Channels free ad-supported TV portal. A customizable Quick Menu lets you easily access picture and sound settings, or anything else you want to be just a quick button press away, and there\u2019s even a chatbot available to help you diagnose and solve any issues with the TV.\nThe LG C4 has comprehensive gaming support. Its four HDMI 2.1 ports support 4K 120Hz, Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync, and 4K Dolby Vision gaming, and the C4 is among the first TVs to be 144Hz-certified by Nvidia. Cloud gaming is also covered on the C4, with GeForce Now, Amazon Luna, Utomik, Blacknut, and Boosteroid apps all available in the Gaming Quick Card. When the TV detects a connected gaming console, it conveniently switches into Game Optimizer mode, which enables an impressive 9.2ms input lag (in Boost mode) and also provides a game menu for making on-the-fly adjustments.\nAt $1,999 / \u00a31,899 / AU$3,299 officially for a 55-inch model, the LG C4 isn\u2019t exactly cheap, though we\u2019ve already seen it drop considerably lower in Prime Day sales. If you value the picture quality advantages that OLED TVs bring to the table \u2013 and if you\u2019re a movie fan or gamer, you should \u2013 then the C4 is a mid-range TV well worth considering, especially since it\u2019s available for much less than more premium options. Considering the quality you get, it's a great investment in future-proof TV that you'll be happy with for a long time.\nLG C4 test results\nThe best budget OLED TV\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1 minute summary: If you're looking for a cheaper way to get a 2024 OLED TV, then the LG B4 is for you. Although it's price isn't much less than the step-up LG C4, it's still cheaper, with further discounts likely to come. The B4 may be the entry-level OLED in LG's 2024 lineup, but I feel it outperforms its price, delivering a rich, colorful, accurate picture with plenty of detail. When I tested the B4, it proved to be a fantastic performer for movies, but also an accomplished gaming TV, with its four HDMI 2.1 ports supporting many features found in the best gaming TVs such as 4K, 144Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, VRR and more. I found its during testing that its sound isn't the strongest, with limited bass and average virtual surround reproduction, and its picture brightness pales compared to more premium OLED TVs, but the B4 is still an excellent entry-level set.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want an OLED on a budget: The B4 is cheaper than any other 2024 OLED TV on the market and mostly covers all the bases.\n\u2705 You want a cheaper OLED for gaming: The B4 is an excellent gaming TV, with four HMDI 2.1 ports supporting 4K, 144Hz, VRR and more.\n\u2705 You want a detailed picture: The LG B4's crisp detail, rich contrast and bold colors suggest a more premium OLED.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want great sound: The B4's built-in sound doesn't match the quality of its picture, with limited bass and Dolby Atmos effects.\n\u274c You want the brightest OLED: Compared with step-up OLED models, the B4's brightness is average, peaking at 656 nits.\n\u274c You need full HDR support: The B4 supports Dolby Vision HDR, but not HDR10+.\nIn-depth analysis\nThe B4's picture impressed during our testing, with its deep black levels, strong contrast and vibrant colors in particular standing out. In our review, we praised the B4's \"exceptional shadow detail\" and its Dolby Vision Filmmaker Mode, which provided an accurate picture with ease. We did find that its lower brightness made its picture less dynamic than what you'll find in step-up OLEDs such as the LG C4, but the B4's picture is still very good, especially for an OLED at this price.\nThe B4's sound is average and while it does the job, it won't beat TVs like the Sony Bravia 8 anytime soon. While it delivers clear dialogue and has a good balance, its bass is limited and virtual surround sound effects lack impact. At higher volumes, it can even sound \"thin and edgy\" as we said in our review. For casual viewing, the B4's sound will most likely be fine, but if you're looking for a more cinematic experience, you'll want to add a soundbar.\nThe B4 uses LG's own smart TV platform, webOS, and it's easily one of the best smart interfaces on the market. Quick Cards organize apps into easy to navigate categories and a Quick Menu, which we praised in our review, means useful settings can be adjusted easily without moving away from what's on screen. There is a large banner ad at the top of the home page, but this is becoming commonplace on smart TV platforms and is really the only criticism we have of the user-friendly webOS.\nWith four HDMI 2.1 ports supporting 4K 144Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, VRR (including AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia GSync), HGiG, ALLM and Dolby Vision gaming, the B4 has things more than covered when it comes to gaming. Its Game Optimizer is a useful feature that allows for easy adjustments to gaming settings and there's also cloud gaming app support. A 9.1ms input lag time (with Boost Mode activated) means the B4 delivers exceptional gaming performance and combined with the features listed above, the B4 comes out as a superb gaming OLED with a cheaper price tag.\nThe 65-inch B4 costs roughly $1,499 / \u00a31,699 / AU$2,795. When compared to the $1,599/ \u00a31,899 / AU$3,495 you'll pay for the LG C4, which provides higher brightness and a performance boost thanks to a faster processor, the B4 doesn't offer the greatest value overall. Still, it is a well-featured and high quality OLED TV that more than justifies its price.\nLG B4 test results\nThe best premium OLED TV\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-minute summary: The LG G5 is the company's flagship OLED for 2025, and when I tested it, with its next-gen OLED panel, I could barely have been more impressed. Not only does this new panel bring spectacular color and contrast, but high brightness levels I didn't though would be possible on OLED a few years ago. Not only does it bring incredible picture quality, but it also comes loaded with the full suite of features I've come to expect from LG's OLEDs in both gaming and smart-based applications. I also found that the new AI-based tools in LG's latest smart TV platform, webOS 25, should give some users real help when navigating their new OLED TV. While it may be a pricier option than its step-down counterpart, the LG C5, I said in my review it still serves as \"a best-in-class OLED TV option for 2025\". It's easily the premium OLED to beat this year.\nRead our full LG G5 review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want an OLED fit for all rooms: With higher fullscreen brightness levels and a new Filmmaker Ambient Light Mode, the G5 is ideal for all viewing situations.\n\u2705 You want a TV for wall-mounting: With a slim-fit, wall-hugging design, the G5 will look perfect on your wall.\n\u2705 You want a premium OLED for gaming: 4K, 165Hz, AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync and a low 9.1ms input lag make the G5 one of the best gaming TVs around.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want HDR10+ support: While it supports Dolby Vision, the G5 does not support HDR10+, which is used on some 4K Blu-rays and streaming services.\n\u274c You don't want to use a soundbar: The G5's built-in speakers are more than adequate, but don't match the level of its picture quality. It deserves a soundbar or speaker system.\n\u274c You want to save money: The step-down LG C5 doesn't deliver the same brightness or color depth, but it's significantly cheaper while delivering basically the same features.\nIn-depth analysis\nThe LG G5 introduces a new OLED panel called Primary Tandem RGB or 'four-stack', that delivers incredible brightness and amazing color and contrast. Now holding the distinction of the brightest OLED we've tested so far (it hit 2,268 nits in Filmmaker Mode), the G5 is superb in all viewing conditions with no need to adjust lighting. As we pointed out in our review \"contrast, color saturation, and shadow detail all held up nicely even with my room\u2019s overhead lighting on\". A new Filmmaker Ambient Light Mode also effectively adjust gamma to suit your room's lighting conditions, meaning you never need to alter your settings. It also delivers fantastic motion for both sports and movies.\nThe G5's built-in 4.2 channel speaker system delivers clear speech and effective positioning of spatial sound effects, especially when using the AI Sound Pro mode. A new Sound wizard also allows you to create your own sound profile (in a similar vein to the TV's picture Wizard) which could be useful for some users. While the G5's sound is perfectly good, it deserves a robust Dolby Atmos soundbar to match its picture prowess.\nAlready one of the best smart TV platforms on offer, webOS 25 introduces new AI-based tools such as AI Search and AI Concierge that make browsing for and finding recommended movies and TV shows a breeze. Its Quick Card and Quick Menu remain useful staples of the webOS interface that make navigation user-friendly and easy. Plus, it runs smoothly with fast, lag-free performance.\nAs we said in our review \"LG TVs have fantastic gaming credentials\" and the G5 is no different. Four HDMI 2.1 ports all support 4K, 165Hz, VRR (AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync), HGiG and Dolby Vision gaming, plus it boasts an ultra-low 9.1 ms input lag time when Boost mode in the Game Optimizer menu is activated. Its Game Quick Card also has access to a wealth of cloud based gaming portals such as Luna and Nvidia GeForce Now. When it comes to gaming TVs, it doesn't get better than the G5.\nThe G5 is a premium priced TV, but it delivers premium features and performance. That being said, the step-down LG C5 delivers a lot similar features and excellent performance for a lower cost and the G5 is priced higher than some of its rivals, including the Samsung S95F at launch. Still, given what the G5 does deliver, its pricing isn't surprising or unfair.\nLG G5 test results\nThe best OLED TV for sound\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-minute summary: Panasonic models consistently rank among the best OLED TVs, and the Panasonic Z95A, the company\u2019s flagship model for 2024, continues that tradition. Notably, the Z95A is among the first Panasonic TVs to be sold in the United States in over a decade, and it\u2019s an impressive offering for US consumers to become reacquainted with the brand. Our selection of the Z95A as the best OLED TV for sound is based on its built-in 5.1.2-channel, 160W Dolby Atmos speaker system, which features both side and top-firing drivers that deliver powerfully immersive sound for a TV. There\u2019s even a subwoofer output jack for connecting a sub for extra bass, and Space Tune and Sound Focus modes that let you automatically EQ the sound for your room, and adjust it for off-center seating, respectively. Featuring an OLED MLA panel that delivers impressively high brightness, the Z95A also delivers on the picture quality front, and it has special picture modes such as Netflix Adaptive Calibrated that optimize pictures when viewing with that streaming service. Panasonic\u2019s top OLED TV resides at the upper tier of the OLED TV price range, but its excellent performance, and effective built-in speakers, which are a perfectly adequate alternative to an external soundbar, strongly enhance its value.\nRead our full Panasonic Z95A review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You\u2019ll be watching in a bright room: The Z95A\u2019s picture is bright enough to hold up in well-lit rooms, and its anti-reflection screen helps to reduce screen reflections from lamps.\n\u2705 You want great sound, but not a soundbar: A built-in 5.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos speaker system on the Z95A delivers powerful and surprisingly immersive audio. It\u2019s good enough that you don\u2019t need a soundbar.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want the best possible gaming TV: The Z95A has a great suite of gaming features, but unlike some competitors, it has only two HDMI 2.1 ports and no built-in cloud-based gaming.\n\u274c You want the best smart TV interface: The Amazon Fire TV interface used by the Z95A is an improvement over the smart TV system used by earlier Panasonic TVs, but it\u2019s overly busy and focused on Amazon\u2019s Prime Video streaming offerings.\nIn-depth analysis\nWhen I tested the Panasonic Z95A, I was impressed with its rich color reproduction and strong contrast. What sets the Z95A apart from other OLED TVs, however, is the high brightness yielded by its OLED MLA (Micro Lens Array) panel, which delivered a peak brightness of 1,495 nits on a 10% white window pattern when I measured it. That level of brightness ranks it among other top OLED TVs such as the LG G4 and in my viewing brought out a full level of detail in high dynamic range sources, which popped visually on the Panasonic\u2019s screen. The Z95A also displayed exceptional shadow detail even in challenging movies and TV shows like The Penguin on Max, and its impressive motion handling made all manner of sports and games look smooth and blur-free.\nThe Z95A is designed to be used without a soundbar, and its 160W, 5.1.2-channel built-in speakers deliver the immersive audio goods when watching movies or shows with Dolby Atmos soundtracks. With up-firing drivers located at the top of the TV\u2019s frame, height effects in soundtracks come across as surprisingly vivid for built-in TV speakers, and the front-firing left, right and center channel drivers deliver clear dialogue and accurate effects placement. This is one TV that can play loud, and its Space Tune automatic EQ feature ensures that bass effects sound smooth and bloat-free in your room while a Sound Focus feature lets you optimize the sound delivery for your chosen seating position.\nPanasonic TVs for 2024 get an upgrade to the Fire TV smart TV interface, and it\u2019s a big improvement over the company\u2019s previous my Home Screen interface used for streaming. The screen is a bit on the crowded side, though mostly asy to navigate and also provides unique features such as an Ambient mode that lets you generate images using AI. There are extensive adjustments for tweaking both picture and sound, so if you want to go to town making your TV look and sound perfect, you\u2019ll find all the tools you need in the Z95A\u2019s setup menus.\nThe Z95A has extensive gaming features, including two HDMI 2.1 ports with 4K 144Hz, VRR (including Nvidia G-Sync and AMD Freesync Premium), and Dolby Vision gaming support. There\u2019s also a Game Control Board pop-up menu that lets you makes tweaks to gaming-related settings without having to exit the main screen. I measured input lag in Game mode on the Z95A as a very respectable 12.6ms when I tested it. All considered, the Z95A is an excellent TV for gaming, and although we typically look for four HDMI 2.1 ports on the best gaming TVs, this Panasonic\u2019s excellent built-in sound means you won\u2019t need to sacrifice one of those ports for a soundbar.\nPanasonic\u2019s Z95A is undoubtedly an expensive TV, though it\u2019s priced in the same approximate range as other flagship OLED TVs such as the LG G5 and Samsung S95D. The same feature that put the Z95A on this list as the best OLED TV for sound \u2013 its impressive built-in 5.1.2-channel speaker array \u2013 goes far to enhance its value, however, since the sound is good enough that you can get away with not using an external soundbar, which will save you money.\nPanasonic Z95A test results\nThe best OLED TV for bright rooms\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1-minute summary: The Samsung S95F has the reflection-beating matte screen of its predecessor, the S95D, but improves on it by maintaining more accurate black levels even in bright conditions. It also delivers spectacular colors and realistic textures. The S95F is a gamer's dream, with 4K 165Hz, VRR (AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync), ALLM and HDR10+ gaming support across four HDMI 2.1 ports and is a good-looking TV, with a razor-thin profile. While its sound could be better and there is still some black crush in darker scenes, the S95F is still undeniably one of 2025's best TVs.\nRead our full Samsung S95F review\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want an OLED fit for all rooms: With OLED Glare Free anti-reflection tech, the S95F's impeccable picture can be viewed in the brightest of rooms.\n\u2705 You want the QD-OLED experience: Contrast, brightness and color are all fantastic on the S95F, proving the advantages of its QD-OLED display panel.\n\u2705 You want an OLED that looks premium: A trim profile, razor-thin depth, and an external connections box to keep things neat make the S95F one of the best-looking TVs around.\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want full HDR support: Despite covering nearly all the bases, the S95D does not support Dolby Vision HDR.\n\u274c You want the absolute best black levels: The S95F's anti-reflection screen is useful, but it does compromise on black levels, which look raised compared to the competition.\n\u274c You're on a budget: Elite performance does come with an elite price tag, and the S95F sits near the top end of the OLED market.\nIn-depth analysis\nI described the S95F as \" a sight to behold even compared to the best OLED TVS\" in my review, thanks to its stunning brightness levels, gorgeous, vibrant colors and solid contrast. The real star of the show is its OLED Glare Free 2.0 screen, which eliminates pesky mirror-like reflections even in the brightest of rooms. Its motion handling is also responsive with a bit of tweaking, making it great for viewing sports. While there are instances of black crush, the S95F's picture is staggeringly good and it's easily one of the best I've seen in 2025.\nTizen has never been the best smart TV platform, but Tizen 9.0, the 2025 version, is the best one yet. With a useful quick menu, access to every major app and hubs for app organisation \u2013 Game, Home, Daily+ and Ambient \u2013 Tizen is now in a better place. Yes, some settings are still buried in deep menus and are a pain to access, but that is my only real gripe with this now-great smart TV system.\nThe S95F's built-in sound delivers punchy bass, effective placement and tracking of sound thanks to Samsung's Object Tracking Sound+ feature, and speech is clear throughout. Where the S95F comes up short is in its narrow-feeling soundstage, which isn't as immersive as the sound on TVs from the likes of Sony and Panasonic. Some people will be pleased with the S95F's sound, but others may want a soundbar for a more cinematic experience.\nGaming is another area where the S95F shines. It's packed with gaming features, including 4K 165Hz, VRR with AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync, ALLM and HDR10+ gaming, along with four HDMI 2.1 ports. It also delivers an ultra-low 9.5ms input lag time as well as Samsung's Gaming Hub with cloud gaming options for those without a console. Picture-wise, the S95F benefits any game played on it. The S95F is a phenomenal gaming TV that gamers will love.\nAs always, judging a flagship OLED's value is tough. While the S95F more than delivers for the money with its features, picture quality and premium design, its price tag ($2,499 / \u00a32,499 for the 55-inch model I tested) will outstretch most budgets. The S95F is an elite TV after all, so its hefty price tag is to be expected.\nSamsung S95F test results\nHow to choose an OLED TV\nHow to choose the best OLED TV for you\nOLED TVs tend to be premium TVs, which means you're getting a certain level of features in almost all of them \u2013 they're all 4K, they're mostly 120Hz for gaming, for example, and they tend to all have four HDMI ports, and premium smart TV software.\nBut they're absolutely not all the same. Some are much brighter than others (around twice as bright, in some cases), some have more HDMI 2.1 ports for next-gen gaming, some have better sound systems, and they don't all come in the same size options.\nIt's important to consider what size TV is best for you, and to do that you'll literally need to measure the space you have to work with. Remember a TV that fills every available scrap of space in your living room might sound like a great idea, but you'll need to consider viewing angles, screen brightness and whether you'll be able to sit a decent distance from the TV to fully appreciate it. The LG C4 has the widest range of sizes of any TV we feature, so if you need something smaller, that's a great place to start.\nWhen it comes to HDR support, we recommend mostly that people choose TVs with Dolby Vision, because it's the most commonly used advanced HDR format on the best streaming services. Samsung TVs only use HDR10+, which is similar technology, but not as well supported. It's not a dealbreaker that Samsung's TVs don't support Dolby Vision, but as you'll see in our list, we prefer sets that include it.\nWhat new OLED TVs are coming soon?\nAt the start of the year, at the big CES 2025 technology show, we got our first look at the new OLED TVs coming during 2025.\nLG has released the LG G5, which has taken a top-level spot on this list as our choice for 'Best premium OLED.' We've also reviewed the mid-range LG C5 OLED, though the LG C4 remains our pick as the 'Best for most people' due to its ongoing availability and excellent value. The LG B5 budget TV should comes a little later, though this year the B5 is only coming in two sizes, sadly.\nThe Samsung S95F, the successor to the S95D in our list (despite the jump in letters), was also unveiled at CES, and massively impressed us in our first S95F hands-on, thanks to its next-gen anti-reflection tech. This TV also comes in an 83-inch model for the first time \u2013 though that size will use a new-gen W-OLED panel (the same as the LG G5) instead of the QD-OLED panel used for the 55-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch sizes. Samsung also announced the S90F mid-range OLED TV, in sizes from 42 inches to 83 inches. Finally Samsung will have a cheaper S85F OLED TV option, which is expected to be less bright. The Samsung S95F is again likely to launch in early spring, with the other models several weeks behind.\nSansui has announced that it will have a budget range of OLED TVs from 55 to 77 inches in the US, which we expect will start from about $800 based on last year's models \u2013 that's massively cheaper than the equivalent from LG.\nPanasonic announced that it will launch a new range of OLEDs, led by the flagship Panasonic Z95B. We expect this to launch later in the year, as is common for Panasonic's OLEDs. We loved the Z95B when we got to try it at CES, though it will probably be very expensive.\nHisense will have some OLED TV options in some countries, but we're waiting on confirmation of what those TVs will be in terms of size and specs.\nSony has announced the new Sony Bravia 8 II OLED, and Philips will likely announce new OLED TVs for the UK and Europe, also closer to spring.\nWe don't have prices or confirmed release dates for some of these TVs, but we're able to predict the above based on experience with these companies in previous years, and contacts within the industry.\nHow much do OLED TVs cost?\nThe cost of OLED TVs varies hugely depending on what technologies are thrown in with an OLED panel, such as the resolution, processor, build quality, built-in speakers, and more. But suffice to say that entry-level models sit around (or, more recently, just under) the $1,000 / \u00a3900 / AU$1,500 mark.\nMore mid-tier OLEDs at larger sizes (65 inches and above) can double that figure, or triple it when you're looking at the cutting-edge high-end panels. You might also notice that you don't get that much of a lower price with the smaller 42-inch sizes of OLED TV \u2013 that's because making them so small relies on relatively new tech, so they're not quite such good value per inch.\nSales periods such as Prime Day or Black Friday tend to include lots of discounts on OLED TV models, though \u2013 especially from LG and Samsung.\nShould I buy OLED or QLED?\nOLED isn't the only option for savvy TV buyers. Samsung's competing QLED televisions outperform for brightness, while the introduction of Mini LED backlights has only improved peak light output and overall contrast \u2013 the areas that OLED generally has the upper hand with, thanks to its per-pixel brightness control.\nIt's a tighter race than ever, then, though it's worth assessing secondary characteristics for OLED and QLED screens. An OLED with a cheap processor may cause more artefacts and video noise, while a QLED with edge-lighting won't get the true benefit of its enhanced color and contrast. Format or feature support can be crucial if you're hooking up your TV to a PC, a games console, or a 4K Blu-ray player too.\nWhat is the lifespan of an OLED TV?\nAccording to LG Display, the makers of the OLED panels that go into every OLED TV on the list - around 100,000 hours. For most folks that's about 10 years of TV watching and far exceeds the 40,000 to 60,000-hour lifespans of most LED-LCD TVs. That said, OLED TVs can experience something called burn-in when a static image is left on the screen for prolonged periods of time - so be sure to change the channel every few days.\nBest OLED TV competitors: what else is out there?\nOLED is, for many, the premium TV tech of the moment. Though once weighed down by inaccessible price points, a flurry of cheaper mid-range OLEDs and smaller panel sizes has helped bring OLED closer to the mass market.\nSamsung and Sony's current TV lineups include QD-OLED hybrids (they combine OLED panels with quantum dot tech, utilising the self-emissive properties of the former and color enhancements of the latter) \u2013 we have a separate guide to whether you should buy a Samsung OLED TV, if you want to read more about them.\nFor those with cash to splash, you'll be choosing between a high-end OLED TV and Micro LED \u2013 a self-emissive panel technology that Samsung has leant into in recent times, but which has proved difficult to offer either affordably or at mainstream sizing (88-inch is the smallest we've heard about so far, as of 2024).\nIt's a more complicated picture than simply OLED, then, though for deep blacks and true-to-life color \u2013 at a size you can actually get into the average living room \u2013 OLED may still be the best choice.\nIs burn-in a problem in OLED TVs?\nBurn-in, also known as screen burn or permanent image retention, is a visual artefact that sometimes appears when a TV has shown the same thing in the same place for a long time. It definitely happens on some OLED TVs, but manufacturers have come up with lots of ways to minimise the likelihood of it happening to yours.\nThere are three main ways in which OLED TVs can minimise the likelihood of burn-in. They can use image analysis to identify static images \u2013 TV channel logos, for example \u2013 and subtly dim them. They can gently shift the image around by a few pixels, something that your OLED probably does already without you noticing it.\nAnd there's a more brute-force approach, where the TV automatically dulls the brightness of the whole display when it detects a bright and potentially burn-in item. That latter one is the least popular because if it isn't implemented well it can be quite dramatic and quite annoying. More modern TVs with this tech, known as ABL (Auto Brightness Limiting) are much more subtle about it than older ones.\nLast but not least, you can take the DIY route. The default modes such as Vivid Mode on some TVs can be ridiculously bright, so changing them or using less blazing settings will make your eyes happy and reduce the risk of burn-in even further.\nUltimately burn-in is all about heat, hence the name. And the best way to reduce the risk of it and perhaps eliminate it altogether is to manage heat better in OLED TVs. And manufactures are doing just that. You'll find clever heatsink technology and heat dissipation design in OLEDs from Panasonic, LG, Sony and more.\nWe're not saying burn-in doesn't exist. It does. But the advances in OLED TV tech in recent years means it's much less of an issue than it was in early OLEDs, and for most of us it's something we don't really need to worry about too much.\nWhich OLED TVs are best for gaming?\nArguably, all OLED TVs are ideal for gaming as they typically have a fast, 120Hz or higher refresh rate and pixel-level brightness control that helps fast-motion images look solid. Even so, there are differences between the various OLED TVs in this guide that can make them better suited for different gaming scenarios.\nHigh dynamic range support varies among the different TV brands, and that can have an impact on gaming. Samsung TVs, for instance, support the HDR10+ format, but not Dolby Vision. So, if you\u2019re using an Xbox Series X console, you won\u2019t be able to take advantage of its Dolby Vision gaming capabilities when playing on a Samsung TV. LG TVs, in contrast, do have Dolby Vision HDR support, but not the competing HDR10+ format. That\u2019s not as much as an issue for gaming, however, as the availability of games with HDR10+ is very limited compared to Dolby Vision. Panasonic TVs support both the Dolby Vision and HDR10+ formats.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a maximum 4K 144Hz refresh rate for PC gaming, you\u2019ll find broad support for that feature among the TVs in this guide. In fact, the only TV that doesn\u2019t offer 4K 144Hz support is the LG B4, which maxes out at 4K 120Hz.\nThe Samsung and LG TVs in this guide each provide four HDMI 2.1 ports with 4K 120Hz pass-through. Having four HDMI ports on a TV used for gaming is important because it allows you to connect both PS5 and Xbox One X gaming consoles and take advantage of their high refresh rate capability while also connecting a soundbar to the TV. Like many other TVs, the Panasonic TV in our guide maxes out at two HDMI 2.1 ports. That\u2019s not so much of an issue in this case, however, since the Panasonic\u2019s excellent built-in speaker system is powerful enough that you don\u2019t necessarily need a soundbar.\nHow bright are OLED TVs compared to other TVs?\nOLED TVs in the past lagged behind QLED TVs with regular LED and mini-LED backlights when it came to brightness. The most recent crop of high-end OLED TVs has changed the game, however, by using new technologies such as QD-OLED (a Samsung-developed tech that combines an OLED display panel with quantum dots which is used in specific Samsung and Sony OLED TVs) and Micro Lens Array (an LG-developed tech combining a layer of microscopic lens elements with an OLED panel that\u2019s used on specific OLED TVs from LG and other brands, including Panasonic). LG has also introduced the Primary Tandem RGB (four-stack) panel to the mix, adding even more brightness and more accurate black levels and color to deliver brightness like we've never seen in an OLED before.\nThese new technologies have now made OLED competitive on the brightness front, with new models such as the Samsung S95D, LG G5 and even the LG G4 delivering peak brightness levels that even exceed some mini-LED TVs, which are typically the brightness champs. The LG G5 and G4 and especially the Samsung S95D also use anti-glare screen coatings, which, combined with the TV\u2019s high brightness levels, make them a reasonable option for viewing in well-lit living rooms.\nHow we test the best OLED TVs\nWhen testing the best OLED TVs, we use the same criteria that we consider in all of our TV reviews, which focuses on picture quality, audio quality, smart TV platform, design, gaming features and value for money. Our testing is not only made up of subjective opinions about each of criteria, but also on objective measurements taken using specialized equipment \u2013 you can read our full guide to how we test TVs at TechRadar, or read on for a summary.\nUsing different AV sources, including broadcast, streaming and Blu-ray, we\u2019ll run in every TV whilst cycling through its picture preset modes, such as Sport, Movie and Standard, to determine which settings are the most accurate for different types of media. We do this to determine what the best settings are for watching movies and TV shows or a sports match for example. Once we have established which picture modes are best suited for different types of content, we then analyze aspects of the display such as its colors, contrast, black levels and more using reference scenes we have specifically chosen to best evaluate these.\nWhen testing an OLED\u2019s picture quality, we\u2019re looking for deep black levels and contrast, which should be better than many other TVs on the market thanks to the screen\u2019s ability to dim individual pixels over local dimming found in LCD TVs \u2013 often this is determined by zones and the backlight\u2019s ability. We\u2019ll also look at the color\u2019s vibrancy and punchiness compared to textures and details, particularly sharpness and true-to-life accuracy.\nUsing lower-resolution sources such as broadcast and DVD, we\u2019ll also test a TV\u2019s upscaling, looking to see how effectively that TV\u2019s processing can enhance lower-res images to be displayed on a larger, 4K screen. During these tests, we also consider the viewing angle from off-center seats, which \u2013 again with the OLED panel\u2019s ability to self-dim \u2013 should maintain strong contrast levels and picture quality even from the most awkward of viewing positions.\nAfter these subjective tests, we then take specialized equipment \u2014 a colorimeter, test pattern generator and Portrait Displays\u2019 Calman calibration software \u2013 to perform objective tests and record the results, taking measurements of brightness, color and grayscale accuracy, gamut and more.\nThe first test we usually do is of the TV\u2019s brightness. Using different sized white window patterns, we measure the the TV\u2019s peak brightness on windows including 10%, which will show the maximum brightness we can expect from the TV itself, and 100% to test full screen brightness, which will demonstrate how the TV can handle consistent levels of brightness across the whole screen (this is key when viewing sports). Full screen brightness also gives an idea of how well a TV will manage reflections.\nOLED TVs have often been known to offer lower levels of brightness when compared to QLED and mini-LED. But in recent years, the introduction of OLED EX panels and micro-lens-array (MLA) tech means we expect higher peak brightness levels, but still lower full screen brightness when compared to other LCD panels. We use light controlled environments when testing brightness to make sure any other light sources, environmental or otherwise, does not affect results.\nWe also test color color reproduction in both SDR and HDR to compare its accuracy when displaying different source materials and the maximum color gamut it can show on screen. We do the same for grayscale as well, testing just how accurately a TV displays gray tones from black to white. With OLED TVs, we expect color accuracy to be among the best in the TV market, along with grayscale.\nGaming is another important aspect of TVs nowadays, so we make sure to test a TV\u2019s gaming performance by analyzing response time, graphics and latency \u2014 all of which are areas OLED TVs often excel at. We also look out for features such as a Game Mode (for adjusting a TV\u2019s settings to the most optimum for gaming), 4K 120Hz, VRR and more. We measure response time by using a Leo Bodnar 4K HDMI input lag tester to see what latency is added by a TV\u2019s processing.\nWe always aim to keep our testing as consistent as possible, but it\u2019s important to note that some of our writers\u2019 setups and testing environments do vary. We do, however, make sure that all tests conducted use the same criteria between all of our writers, also making sure that the equipment is similar enough to achieve the same level of accuracy.\nMore OLED TVs we've tested\nWhy is the Samsung S90F series not in this guide?\nThe Samsung S90F series OLED TV received a five-star rating in our Samsung S90F review, but isn\u2019t included in this guide. The main reason for this is that the 65-inch model Samsung sent us for review features a QD-OLED display panel, while other screen sizes in the S90F series are subject to a \u2018panel lottery\u2019 where either a QD-OLED or a regular W-OLED display panel may be used in the TV.\nThis means that our Samsung S90F ratings apply to the 65-inch model and don\u2019t necessarily extend to other screen sizes in the S90F series. Our review praised the S90F for its impressive brightness, richer color than its Samsung S90D predecessor, and its crisp 4K upscaling of HD sources. The only areas where we found its picture lacking were a tendency to crush shadow detail in some presets, and a slight gray cast to blacks when watched in rooms with bright ambient lighting \u2013 a limitation you won\u2019t find on OLED TVs with higher peak light output, such as the LG G5 (included in this guide as 'The best premium OLED.'\nOtherwise, S90F series TVs are an excellent option for gaming, with 4K 144Hz support across all four HDMI 2.1 ports, AMD Freesync Premium Pro format and Nvidia G-Sync, Samsung\u2019s Gaming Hub for cloud-based gaming, and an ultra-low 9.2ms measured input lag. The 65S90F model we tested is also a great value for a QD-OLED TV, coming in around \u00a3700 / $800 cheaper than the 65-inch version of Samsung\u2019s S95F flagship OLED for 2025.\nOther OLED TVs that we've tested\nLG G4: One of LG's flagship OLEDs for 2024, the LG G4 delivers superb picture quality and comes with all the features you'd need; both gaming and smart. It earned five out of five stars in our LG G4 review as it really is the complete package. It's not on our list as it's been replaced by its successor, the LG G5, which delivers everything the G4 does but with added brightness and even better picture quality. Don't get us wrong; the G4 is still a fantastic TV and if you can get a good deal on it, it's absolutely worth the investment!\nLG C5: The successor to the #1 TV in this guide, the LG C4, the LG C5 continues the LG C-series legacy of delivering arguably the best picture, features and performance for its competitive price in the mid-range OLED market. Earning five out of five stars in our LG C5 review, the only reason it's not on this list is because the C4 is still available for far lower prices. The C5 isn't enough of an upgrade to warrant knocking off the C4 yet, but once the C4 is no longer available, the C5 is likely to take its place.\nSony Bravia 8: Sony's only 2024 OLED TV, the Bravia 8 impressed us during testing with its lifelike details and vivid colors, thanks to a brightness boost over its predecessor, the Sony A80L, that make HDR images pop. It's also a solid gaming TV with 'perfect for PS5' features and it has brilliant built-in sound. While it's a great TV, it doesn't hit the right price point like the LG C4, but if you want a more mid-range option with sound good enough to not need a soundbar, it's a very strong option, as our full Sony Bravia 8 review really digs into.\nPanasonic Z85A: A mid-range OLED TV, the Panasonic Z85A still showcases the superb picture quality we've come to know from Panasonic's OLEDs. Plus, it delivers a good array of gaming features and solid built-in sound. Unfortunately, it has to contend with a crowded mid-range OLED TV market that's dominated by the LG C4, which offers a lot of the same plus points of the Z85A at a much cheaper price, though otherwise our Panasonic Z85A review is pretty glowing.\nPhilips OLED809: It's no secret that we here at TechRadar adore Philips' OLED TVs, mostly for their unique Ambilight feature; a series of lights around the frame of the TV that project bold colors around and onto the wall behind. The OLED809 delivers excellent picture quality for a mid-range OLED, but is slightly beaten on overall value by the LG C4 \u2013 it's also only available to our UK and European readers. Read our Philips OLED809 review if you like the idea of a TV that feels much bigger than it is, though.\nPhilips OLED909: This is a high-end TV, using the same elite panel as the LG G4, delivering stunningly bright and HDR-rich picture, aided by the Ambilight feature. The built-in Bowers & Wilkins sound system is also a nice addition, adding real meat compared to other built-in TV speakers, and replacing the need for a smaller soundbar. We think the Samsung S95D is a little more versatile and better value for most people, but it's an excellent TV, no question, as our full Philips OLED909 review digs into.\nPhilips OLED959: This is a truly elite TV, but puts itself in quite a niche bracket by coming in very specific sizing, and with a giant metal stand as part of the package. It's also pricier than the competition \u2013 and its 'upgraded' version of Philips' Ambilight tech was too busy for us, and doesn't actually feel like a higher-end version. Still, you get amazing image quality and top-tier built-in sound, so if you like the idea of a freestanding TV with awesome AV skills, it's well worth reading our Philips OLED959 review.\nThe latest updates to this best OLED TVs guide\nJuly 1, 2025\nReplaced the Samsung S95D with the Samsung S95F due to the latter's higher brightness and improved black levels.\nJune 3, 2025\nAdded 'Why is the Samsung S90F series not in this guide?' entry to 'More we've tested' section.\nApril 17, 2025\nAdded in Quick List with summary for each entry on this list.

The S95C is cheaper than the new model after price drops, but because it's still high-priced, and the S95D has the new anti-glare screen, we think the model is worth paying up for.\nApril 11 2024\nRewrote introduction and updated information throughout to ensure all advice is up-to-date.\nMarch 14 2024\nAdded graphs with data from our testing to each TV's write-up, to make it easy to read and compare that information.\nMarch 6 2024\nExpanded the How We Test section with more in-depth information on how testing procedure works and what tests are carried out.\nFebruary 5 2024\nReplaced the LG A2 with the LG B3 as 'best budget OLED TV.'\nJanuary 5 2023\nAdded the LG G3 as the 'best OLED TV for wall mounting' due to its high review score and special wall-mount bracket.\nDecember 21 2023\nRemoved the Sony A95K and 'best for picture quality' category.

With one of the top soundbars, you get bigger, forward-facing speakers that deliver better speech clarity and immersion in movies. The best bit is they\u2019re sleek and slim, often fitting below your TV on a cabinet, or mounted on the wall.\nSome TVs may not need a soundbar, but plenty of the best TVs you can buy today benefit hugely from an external soundbar for better audio \u2013 especially cheaper ones. The best soundbars tend to come in three styles: all-in-one units with just a single soundbar, soundbars with subwoofers, and soundbars with subwoofers and rear speakers for surround sound. The first is ideal for people who want a minimal setup, the second is great for big sound on a budget, and the third is perfect if you want a real home theater audio experience.\nWe\u2019ve tested a huge number of soundbars and speaker systems over the years, ranging from elite units with Dolby Atmos 3D sound, through to bargain soundbars that boost speech and add depth for very little cash. We're looking for natural sound in all cases that doesn't come across as overblown, and where individual effects can stand out from the overall mix. We want to see ease of use too, no matter how many different speakers are included and in the case of higher-end soundbars we're looking for extra features such as wireless support and HDMI passthrough (including at 4K 120Hz) to justify the pricing.\nSome soundbars include extra features when used with a particular TV, so we'll highlight those where appropriate, and we do test them \u2013 but they don't make or break our recommendations. We test soundbars as if you're buying them as a neutral, so you can get a great upgrade no matter what TV brand you have.\nThe quick list\nIn a hurry but need to find the best soundbar for you? Take a look at our quick list below which covers a soundbar that will suit every budget and situation. You can still check out more detailed reviews of each soundbar below.\nBest overall\nThe best soundbar for most people\nThe Samsung HW-Q800D offers great cinematic sound, Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support at a strong price, for a great range of screen sizes, with HDMI passthrough.

He has been writing about the latest soundbars and TV audio since 2017, and has very strong opinions about the correct ratio of HDMI ports to price.\nAugust 6, 2025\nReplaced the Samsung HW-Q990D with the Samsung HW-Q990F as 'best for Dolby Atmos'. Removed the Sony HT-A7000 and 'best for gaming' category. Added in a table with scores for each soundbar on this list labelled 'Comparison Chart'. Updated 'Other soundbars to consider' and 'New for 2025' sections.\nThe best soundbars you can buy\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best soundbar overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the best-value soundbar: The Q800D delivers a dynamic and punchy sound with impressive Dolby Atmos positional effect for a very good price.\n\u2705 You want a powerful sound: The Q800D is imposing, powerful and immersive, despite being limited to a soundbar and subwoofer in-the-box.\n\u274c You're after 4K 120Hz passthrough: If you have a next-gen console such as a PS5, you'll have to look at other soundbars for 4K 120Hz passthrough.\n\u274c You own the Samsung HW-Q800C: The Q800D doesn't offer much in the way of upgrades over its predecessor, the Samsung HW-Q800C, so if you own the latter, there's no point in upgrading.\nWhat you need to know: The Samsung HW-Q800D is the mid-range soundbar in Samsung's 2024 soundbar lineup, but it delivers a premium performance for the price. It delivers 5.1.2 channels, totaling 360W of power for a sound that's dynamic, engaging and downright impressive. It supports Dolby Atmos and DTS:X surround formats as well as Samsung-centric features such as Q-Symphony, which uses the speakers of compatible Samsung TVs for extra immersion. It also supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for audio streaming. It also has gaming features, but does unfortunately lack 4K 120Hz passthrough to make the most out of consoles. But this is one of the very few downsides to a fantastic soundbar, and it won't matter to everyone, anyway.\nAudio performance: When we heard the Q800D in action, we were blown away by just how sonically impressive it is. A rich, expansive and powerful sound comes through the Q800D, whether its movies or video games. Dolby Atmos and DTS:X surround is immersive, engaging and fully-fledged, which is impressive for a soundbar comprised of two units (a soundbar and subwoofer). Its wide soundstage also means it handles music well, which is no guarantee with soundbars.\nDesign: In terms of looks, the HW-Q800D isn't very visually appealing, with a chunky design and angular look that some find dull. But, it does have a solid build quality and a metal mesh grille that make it feel more premium. While you can get better-looking soundbars, the Q800D is still a perfectly fine looking soundbar.\nValue: The Q800D is exceptional value and while it's not going to beat the likes of the more premium Samsung HW-Q990D in terms of sheer power, #4 on this list, or the Sonos Arc Ultra for looks, #3 on this list, it delivers a level of quality and performance way above its price range. So, it's no wonder that it's easily the best soundbar on the market for most people.\nRead our full Samsung HW-Q800D review\nThe best budget soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an affordable soundbar: The Sony HT-S2000 launched with a higher price than the next cheapest offering at #7 in this list but is now regularly reduced for less.\n\u2705 You want immersive sound: The HT-S2000 offers 3.1 channels of surprisingly powerful sound, with support for virtual Dolby Atmos, for a reasonable price.\n\u274c You own a next-gen console like a PS5: Without 4K 120Hz passthrough, the HT-S2000 isn't the best for gamers. Instead look at #5 in this list.\n\u274c You want a home audio system: The HT-S2000 does not have Wi-Fi so you won't be able to link it up to a multi-room wireless speaker system.\nWhat you need to know: When it comes to sound quality and features vs price, we think the Sony HT-S2000 is the best budget choice around. Although it's a little basic in terms of connectivity, the sound you get from this soundbar is impressive for the money and is certainly a good choice for those looking for an upgrade to their TV sound without breaking the bank.\nAudio performance: While the Sony HT-S2000's sound isn't the biggest, the sound you do get for your money is impressive. Clear dialogue levels and a spacious, virtual surround sound are two of the HT-S2000's highlights. Bass levels are also punchy enough, but it's the Sony HT-S2000's ability to reproduce Dolby Atmos effects that's surprising. It's not going to beat a soundbar with height channels, but for a 3.1 soundbar, it offers plenty.\nDesign: Design wise, the Sony HT-S2000 feels and looks more expensive than it is, with a solid, mesh metal grill on the front and a sturdy black plastic casing housing the speakers. The soundbar also produces visual feedback to remote control commands, something rare on budget soundbars.\nValue: Yes, the HT-S2000 isn't going to set the world alight with its sound and certainly isn't the best soundbar for sound on this list, but when you're paying roughly $349 / \u00a3299 / AU$695 for a soundbar with this good a sound quality, it's hard to argue against.\nRead our full Sony HT-S2000 review\nThe best all-in-one soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want expansive sound from an all-in-one: The Heston 120\u2019s 5.1.2-channel speaker array delivers surprisingly immersive audio and deep bass for an all-in-one unit\n\u2705 You want a unique design: With its guitar-amp-like looks, the Heston 120\u2019s design is certainly unique, making it stand out from the sea of boring, black soundbars.\n\u274c You want the best surround-sound experience: One-box offerings like the Heston 120 can only simulate a true surround experience. You\u2019ll need actual surround speakers to get the real deal.\n\u274c You\u2019re on a tight budget: There are more budget-friendly options that can provide a satisfactory Dolby Atmos experience for less money.\nWhat you need to know: The Marshall Heston 120 is the best all-in-one soundbar you can buy for its asking price. The other soundbars in this list feature additional surround speakers and a subwoofer to deliver a cinematic sound experience, or they skimp out on immersion and bass by opting for a limited speaker array and compact design. The Heston 120, in contrast, features a 5.1.2-channel speaker array with dual active woofers and four passive radiators. With support for both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X soundtracks, the presentation is impressively wide and tall for an all-in-one, and there\u2019s no shortage of deep, powerful bass.\nAudio performance: The Heston 120\u2019s booming bass filled our TV testing facility when we reviewed it, and even managed to convey deep sub-bass in Atmos movie soundtracks. Height and surround effects are conveyed with spatial precision, which lends a true sense of realism to the proceedings, and we even got a sense of sound moving past our shoulder when we tested it. The same qualities that make the Heston 120 great for movies also work for Atmos and stereo music playback. Stereo music in particular sounds smooth and has clear channel separation \u2013 a rare feat for an all-in-one soundbar.\nDesign: Marshall\u2019s design for the Heston 120 unsurprisingly mimics that of its famous guitar amps, with big, golden-hued metallic control knobs, and a white Marshall logo plastered across the front. It\u2019s surely making a statement in the otherwise bland, black world of soundbar design, and those extra elements can be visually distracting when watching movies in dimmed lighting. Bottom line: you\u2019ll either love the design or you won\u2019t. At over a meter in width, the Heston 120 is also on the large side for a soundbar, and there\u2019s no remote control option outside of Marshall\u2019s app, which provides everything you need to get this soundbar up and running.\nValue: At $999 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,799, the Heston 120 is undoubtedly pricey, and you\u2019ll pay the same price for the also impressive Sonos Arc Ultra, our choice as the best option for expandability in this guide. But the Heston 120\u2019s build quality, performance, and features make it a solid, if not exceptional, value, especially if you\u2019re interested in an all-in-one bar that doesn\u2019t make any sonic compromises.\nRead our full Marshall Heston 120 review\nThe best soundbar for Dolby Atmos\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want immersive surround sound: The Q990F delivers a fully immersive, powerful, and tightly controlled sound that not many other soundbar systems can compete with.\n\u2705 You want a compact subwoofer that doesn't compromise: The Q990F's newly designed compact subwoofer is easier to hide, but doesn't skimp on sheer power and control.\n\u274c You're on a budget: The Q990F is a premium soundbar system that unavoidably costs more than budget Dolby Atmos soundbars like #4 in this list.\n\u274c You own the Samsung HW-Q990D: While the Q990F's new subwoofer is great, elsewhere the Q990F is only a slight upgrade over its predecessor, the Q990D.\nWhat you need to know: Samsung\u2019s Q990F is a complete surround sound system in a soundbar package. It has 23 drivers spread across 11.1.4 channels and comprises four units: a soundbar, a subwoofer, and two rear speakers. It delivers engaging, expansive and punchy sound, as well as 4K 120Hz pass-through support for gaming consoles.\nAudio performance: Dolby Atmos soundtracks are reproduced with superb precision and pinpoint accuracy, putting you right into the heart of the action. Speech is clean and clear, and its newly designed, smaller subwoofer doesn't skip out on bass, delivering plenty of hefty rumble while still maintaining control and nuance. Q-Symphony is a bonus for Samsung TV owners, adding even more speakers to the action.\nDesign: The headline here is the newly designed, compact subwoofer, which is sleeker, sharper and much more versatile in terms of space. The Q990F has a similar matte gray/navy finish to its predecessors for a minimalist look, but uses a grille design that isn't as appealing as its predecessors. Still, it has a premium look and feel with a reassuring heft. Its front display continues to be difficult to read, however\nValue: A soundbar system that's this powerful and complete necessarily comes with a high price tag. And while we think that the Q990F's performance justifies the price, you can save some money by picking up its predecessor, the Q990D. Or if you're looking for a budget alternative, check out the Hisense AX5125H at #5 in this list for a cheaper Atmos alternative.\nRead our full Samsung HW-Q990F review\nThe best budget soundbar for Dolby Atmos surround\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want 'real' Atmos sound\nWith 5.1.2 channels, including two surround and two up-firing Atmos speakers, you're getting actual immersive sound rather than virtual processing.\n\u2705 You want to save money\nAt around $350 / \u00a3350 / AU$449, you\u2019re getting a full surround sound speaker package with a subwoofer for the price of many standalone soundbars.\n\u274c You want high-quality music playback\nHisense\u2019s budget bar uses Bluetooth exclusively for music streaming, and that\u2019s a lower-quality option than the Wi-Fi tech used by other soundbars like the Sonos Beam.\n\u274c You want to experiment with EQ\nWhile the Hisense has preset sound modes plus bass and treble controls, its sound adjustments are very basic compared to other soundbars that offer extensive EQ settings and room correction using apps.\nWhat you need to know: The Hisense AX5125H is a 5.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos soundbar system with a wireless subwoofer and surround speakers that sells for under $350 / \u00a3350 / AU$450. What you\u2019re getting here kit-wise for the money is pretty much unbeatable considering the system\u2019s punchy sound and \u201creal\u201d as opposed to virtual, Dolby Atmos effects delivery.\nAudio performance: Hisense\u2019s budget soundbar system punches well above its price class when it comes to sound quality, with clear dialogue, accurate effects placement and good surround immersion. Even music sounds good, though, streaming is limited to Bluetooth quality. The one complaint we have about its sound is that the compact rear speakers can occasionally get overwhelmed by aggressive surround sound mixes.\nDesign: The AX5125H\u2019s build quality falls short of premium \u2013 something to be expected at this price \u2013 though its metal mesh speaker grilles give it a somewhat upscale look. Importantly, the soundbar has a front panel alphanumeric LED display, which provides clear visual feedback when making volume or EQ adjustments with the system\u2019s remote control.\nValue: Given its low price for a 5.1.2-channel soundbar system, the Hisense AX5125H\u2019s value is almost over the top. You\u2019ll pay more than four times as much for the Best soundbar for Dolby Atmos choice on our list, the Samsung HW-Q990D, and while that 11.1.4-channel system will undoubtedly provide a greater sense of sound immersion, many people will be satisfied with the Hisense\u2019s sound for the money.\nRead our full Hisense AX5125H review\nThe best super-cheap soundbar for surround sound\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want surround sound for cheap: The Poseidon D50 offers 5.1 channels of clear, punchy sound for cheaper than most soundbars.\n\u2705 You want a straightforward soundbar: The Poseidon D50 opts for a no-nonsense, plug-in-and-play approach over apps and features.\n\u274c You want the best quality sound: The Poseidon D50's sound can be tinny at times, and rear speakers can get lost in the mix.\n\u274c You want the best looking soundbar: Unsurprisingly, the Poseidon D50 has a plain, plasticky look due to its super-cheap price.\nThe Ultimea Poseidon D50 is the best way to get surround sound for your living room for a low price. Its sound may not be the most dynamic and it's light on features, but at such a low price for a full 5.1 system, it's hard to argue against what it does deliver: clear, punchy and occasionally spacious audio.\nIn our review of the Ultimea Poseidon D50, we enjoyed its clarity of speech and relatively punchy, powerful surround sound. While watching Top Gun: Maverick, we were \"impressed at the three-dimensional sound of soaring aircraft\", especially considering the lack of Dolby Atmos. While the Poseidon D50 doesn't deliver the most cinematic of experiences, with audio sometimes veering on tinny and the rear speakers sometimes struggling to keep up, we said \"for the price you pay, the surround sound certainly surpassed expectations\" and that's all we ask for from this cheap soundbar.\nLight on features due to its budget price, including a lack of Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support (check out the Hisense AX5125H further up the list for a budget Atmos surround soundbar), the Poseidon D50 does still support Bluetooth streaming for music and come with HDMI ARC, optical and 3.5mm ports for connections. There are also three distinct sound modes \u2013 Movie, Dialog and Music \u2013 to cater to what you're watching.\nUltimately, you get what you pay for, and the Ultimea Poseidon D50 delivers solid (but not mind-blowing) surround sound for under $150 / \u00a3150 (we've seen it as low as $119 / \u00a3139). At that price, it's difficult to be disappointed in the Poseidon D50. If you want surround sound for cheap, the Poseidon D50 should be on your list.\nRead our full Ultimea Poseidon D50 review\nThe best super-cheap soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a cheap, but good soundbar: A 2.0-channel soundbar like this is an easy way to upgrade your TV\u2019s sound without incurring a high cost.\n\u2705 You want easy setup: The limited features of Amazon\u2019s soundbar are a benefit if you\u2019re looking for a super-easy model to connect, set up, and use.\n\u274c You want Dolby Atmos support: Dolby Atmos support generally isn\u2019t available on low-cost soundbars like Amazon\u2019s. To get that feature, you\u2019ll need to step up to the Sony HT-S2000, the best budget model on our list.\n\u274c You want bass: The Amazon\u2019s compact design doesn\u2019t permit much in the way of bass, so if that\u2019s important, look for a different model with a separate subwoofer.\nWhat you need to know: Amazon\u2019s first and only soundbar is a basic, compact model that delivers decent sound quality for the price. A 2.0-channel design, it keeps things simple by limiting wired connections to a single HDMI input for a hookup to a TV\u2019s HDMI eARC/ARC port, along with an optical digital connection. Bluetooth is additionally supported for wireless music streaming from a phone or tablet.\nAlthough Amazon\u2019s soundbar lacks Dolby Atmos support, it has Movie, Music and dialogue-boosting EQ modes as well as DTS Virtual:X processing to add a spacious quality to surround-encoded soundtracks. There\u2019s no front-panel alphanumeric display to provide visual feedback \u2013 something you wouldn\u2019t expect to see in a soundbar at this price \u2013 but ergonomics are otherwise good, and with limited connections and features, setup of Amazon\u2019s soundbar is incredibly easy.\nThe Amazon Fire TV soundbar\u2019s main selling point is its price. Amazon lists it for $119.99 / \u00a3199.99 on its site, but regularly lets it go for under $100 in the US. If you\u2019re looking for a basic, super-cheap bar that does a decent job and is easy to set up, Amazon\u2019s soundbar is the one we\u2019d recommend.\nAudio performance: While you can\u2019t expect a 2-channel soundbar like this to work magic with movie soundtracks, Amazon\u2019s bar will provide an instant upgrade over your TV\u2019s built-in speakers, boosting dialogue clarity and adding heft to sound effects. In our review, we found it provided the best sound balance with the Bass setting at Medium, which made voices sound natural and not overly heavy. DTS Virtual:X processing was effective at amping up movie soundtracks and did so without any negative effect to other elements in the mix.\nDesign: At 24 inches wide by 2.5 inches high and 3.5 inches deep, Amazon\u2019s compact soundbar is a good match for smaller TVs. A row of control buttons is provided on top and a remote control is also included. The main design limitation is the LED indicator lights instead of an alphanumeric display for visual feedback, which is common at this price point.\nValue: Given the sound quality, effortless usability, and sturdy design of Amazon\u2019s Fire TV soundbar, it\u2019s a great value and easy recommendation. You\u2019ll have to spend several hundred more to get better performance and features, and many people will be perfectly satisfied with Amazon\u2019s low-budget bar.\nRead our full Amazon Fire TV soundbar review\nThe best premium soundbar for LG TVs\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want immersive, home theater sound: With 9.1.5 channels here along with AI room calibration, you're in for a surround sound treat.\n\u2705 You have an LG TV: It works well whatever you pair it with, but you get access to better features with certain models of LG TVs.\n\u274c You don't have much space: This soundbar system is large, so if you don't have room to spare opt for a smaller alternative like #5 in this list.\n\u274c You're saving money: This isn't a budget buy. You'll have to make sacrifices, but you can find a similar soundbar for less. Check out #2 in this list.\nWhat you need to know: The LG S95TR brings you the convenience and straightforward setup of a soundbar system but with the immersive power and performance of a home theater speaker setup. It works well with everything, but LG TV owners can unlock the best features. The only thing that lets it down a little is its high price. If you're on a budget but still want Atmos and surround sound, take a look at our cheap soundbar pick, the Hisense AX5125H at #4 in this list. But if you can afford it, the features, performance and design of the LG S95TR make it worth every penny.\nAudio performance: With this soundbar's 9.1.5 channels, along with some very impressive AI room calibration, you'll experience a great home theater setup with surround sound and spatial audio (Dolby Atmos and DTS:X). In our review, we described the sound on offer here as \"immersive, engrossing, and engaging\" and with 810 watts of power, the LG S95TR can reach great volumes.\nDesign: This soundbar looks very basic with a subwoofer and two wedge-shaped rear speakers. Unfortunately, there's no LED display, just LED indicator lights, which is disappointing considering how many features are on offer here. You'll need to open LG's control app to find what you need, which is a little annoying. This is also a big system. So if you want to put it in a small room, it might not be the best choice for you.\nValue: The LG S95TR\u2019s $1,499 / AU$1,699 (about \u00a31,200) price feels expensive, but when you compare it with the competition, the fact you're getting a 9.1.5-channel system and the performance on offer here, it's still good value. If you want real surround sound, check out #3 in this list, the Samsung HW-Q990D.\nRead our full LG S95TR review\nThe best compact Atmos soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want great sound from a standalone soundbar: The Smart Soundbar delivers the Bose audio quality one expects. The bass and soundstage width are a bit light, but clarity and dynamics are good.\n\u2705 You want real Dolby Atmos: The soundbar\u2019s two upward-firing speakers let it deliver a real spatial audio experience. Also, a TrueSpace feature can upscale non-Dolby Atmos tracks for spatial audio.\n\u274c You want full surround sound: Adding Bose Ultra Open Earbuds can give a great surround sound experience, but just for one person. If you want full surround sound for around the same price, other options are available.\n\u274c You\u2019re on a tight budget: The Smart Soundbar has a premium price for a single soundbar. You can find similar compact soundbars for less, but you will compromise on both sound quality and features.\nWhat you need to know: The Bose Smart Soundbar is a compact model with real upfiring speakers to properly deliver Dolby Atmos soundtracks. It has built-in Wi-Fi for streaming music, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast support, and can be paired with optional Bose wireless surround sound speakers and a subwoofer if you one day get an urge to upgrade your system. Alternatively, the Smart Soundbar\u2019s Personal Surround Sound feature, which requires Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds, can give you surround sound without having to muck with extra speakers.\nAudio performance: When we reviewed the Bost Smart Soundbar, we noted that it \u201csounds about as good as a soundbar can.\u201d Dialogue is \u201cconsistently intelligible,\u201d and there are level and EQ controls in Bose\u2019s app that let you boost it on an as-needed basis. Because of its compact form factor, both bass and soundstage width are limited, but the Smart Soundbar\u2019s upfiring Atmos speakers, which can also be engaged for non-Atmos movies and music using the TrueSpace feature, help quite a bit to expand the soundfield.\nDesign: At 27 inches wide by 2 inches high and 4 inches deep, it\u2019s a fairly sleek and compact design for an all-in-one unit and a perfect choice for smaller homes or screens. While it only has a single HDMI port, it makes up for this by packaging everything into an attractive all-in-one form.\nValue: This soundbar impressed us in several ways during our testing, and we also appreciated its Personal Surround Sound and TrueSpace features The Bose is also a good value \u2013 as one of the few soundbars that sell for under $500 / \u00a3500 / AU$700, it offers a lot more features than the Sony HT-S2000 at #2 in this list and Amazon Fire TV Soundbar at #8 in this list.\nTo save money on Bose products, check out our Bose discount codes.\nRead our full Bose Smart Soundbar review\nThe best soundbar for flexibility\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need multiple HDMI ports: The JBL Bar 1300X comes with four HDMI ports so multiple devices can be connected.\n\u2705 You want rear speakers with no wires: Supplied with wireless rechargeable speakers, there's no wires to keep things neat and tidy.\n\u274c You want to keep the rear speakers charged: The JBL Bar 1300X's rear speakers need regular recharging, unlike a more traditional setup like the HW-Q800D at #1 in this list.\n\u274c You want the cheapest soundbar: The JBL Bar 1300X is not budget-friendly, even compared to other soundbars in its price range.\nWhat you need to know: The JBL Bar 1300X provides a fantastic level of flexibility. With Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support and a big, beefy sound aided by its larger than average subwoofer, its the connections and features packed into this soundbar that make it so versatile compared to other soundbars on the market. The one downside? This soundbar isn't going to suit serious gamers. While there are multiple HDMI ports here, none of them have 4K 120Hz pass-through to support that resolution and frame rate when playing games on PS5 or Xbox Series X, a feature you can find on our choice on the best soundbar for gaming, the Sony HT-A7000 at #5 in this list.\nAudio performance: We think the JBL Bar 1300X would suit anyone looking for a powerful and immersive soundbar option, but particularly those who are after the visceral excitement that the best home theater systems effortlessly deliver, while also being relatively easy to setup and not becoming a burden on your living room.\nDesign: Although the JBL Bar 1300X doesn't take up too much space, it is designed to fill larger rooms with sound so we wouldn't recommend it in smaller homes. There are also multiple HDMI inputs here, meaning you can connect a stack of extra sources without worry, and the system\u2019s rechargeable rear speakers can also be used as portable Bluetooth speakers. That might be a \"so what?\" feature for some people, but to us it's a design flex that heightens the Bar 1300X's overall value.\nValue: Priced in line with the likes of the Sonos Arc Ultra at #3 in this list, the JBL Bar 1300X is not cheap but does deliver a lot flexibility to make up for it. From the rechargeable rear speakers that can also be used as bluetooth speakers and number of HDMI ports to the easy setup and immersive sound, this is one of the most flexible soundbars we've found. (Note: in some countries, you get the JBL Bar 1300 \u2013 without the X \u2013 which has a smaller 10-inch subwoofer driver instead of the 12-inch in the X version. This is a relatively small difference, and doesn't alter our overall opinion.)\nRead our full JBL Bar 1300X review\nThe best soundbar for expandability\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want big and cinematic sound: The Arc Ultra's special bass driver sounds excellent, and its sound balance is excellent, especially the dialogue.\n\u2705 You want an expandable soundbar: You get great Dolby Atmos effects from a single box here , and it can be easily expanded with Sonos surround speakers and subs.\n\u274c You want high-end DTS:X support: Fans of Blu-rays or streaming IMAX Enhanced movies may be annoyed by this \u2013 you won't get the full power.\n\u274c You struggle to have enough HDMI ports on your TV: There's no HDMI passthrough here, so you simply lose the use of whichever port it's connected to.\nWhat you need to know: The Sonos Arc Ultra is the best soundbar for expandability. It sounds great on its own, but the flexible nature of the Sonos ecosystem lets you easily add surround speakers and a subwoofer as your needs and budget change. Other soundbars here deliver more immersion by filling your room with multiple boxes, but if you want deep, expansive, expertly balanced movie audio from one slender bar, with the option to add to it later, this is the way to go.\nAudio performance: The Sonos Arc Ultra is a very impressive piece of audio design, thanks partly to its 'Sound Motion' bass driver, which is a very small speaker that produces decent bass without a separate subwoofer. It helps the overall sound balance of the Arc Ultra to be absolutely superb, with great impact, very clear yet natural dialogue, and effects that jump right out of the mix. The Dolby Atmos 3D sound is excellent for a single-box soundbar as well, really adding motion and layers to individual sounds. A massive upgrade over any TV's built-in sound.\nDesign: This is small for a powerful one-box soundbar \u2013 but that's relative! It's pretty wide, though will work for TVs of 55 inches and up, but it's not too tall or deep (though may be too tall for some very low-slung TVs). It feels really well made, and the simple, hard-shell black or white design disappears nicely into your decor. The connections are in a recess in the back \u2013 as is the Bluetooth pairing button, annoyingly (but you can use the Sonos app to pair too). It's wall-mountable, too.\nValue: This is strong value, simply because it sounds so good for under $1000 / \u00a31000. It's also great that it works as part of the Sonos ecosystem, and can be expanded with Sonos' wireless speakers as rear speakers, or with a dedicated, more powerful subwoofer. However, its lack of DTS-HD/DTS:X support and not having an HDMI passthrough port when all of its key rivals do mean it's less-than-perfect on value \u2013 but if you don't care about those things, then they're not a problem!\nRead our full Sonos Arc Ultra review\nThe best soundbar for wall-mounting\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a versatile design: It\u2019s our top choice for wall-mounting, but it\u2019s just as happy on a tabletop. If you want flexibility for both, you\u2019ll find it here.\n\u2705 You want more powerful sound than a standard TV can muster: You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the low profile of this soundbar means it doesn\u2019t pack a punch, but no built-in TV sound is anywhere near this good.\n\u274c You\u2019d prefer a full surround sound experience: You\u2019ll get a pleasingly large soundstage here, but with no rear speakers, it won\u2019t wrap sound around you like the best systems can.\n\u274c Wall-mounting is only a \u201cnice to have\u201d: Pretty sure you won\u2019t wall-mount it? Look elsewhere. It\u2019s still a great choice, but if it\u2019ll always sit on your TV table, its versatility won\u2019t matter.\nWhat you need to know: The Samsung HW-QS700F soundbar blends the performance of Samsung\u2019s Q series with the sleek, lifestyle-friendly design of its S series. Its standout feature is the ability to automatically optimize its 3.1.2-channel speaker setup depending on whether it\u2019s mounted horizontally or vertically. In vertical mode, its flatter profile pairs neatly with a slim, wall-mounted TV. Sound quality is solid for the price, with support for Dolby Atmos, DTS and Bluetooth. It comes with a Samsung wireless subwoofer and can also be paired with surround speakers \u2013 but it\u2019s the wall-mounting versatility that really sets this model apart.\nAudio Performance: Despite its affordable price, this soundbar\u2019s 3.1.2-channel configuration delivers an impressive level of power, detail, and staging. Most of that top-performing sound holds up regardless of its orientation, though there are some minor niggles depending on how you use it. Then again, as we noted in our review, it still outperforms the vast majority of rivals. You\u2019ll also get to enjoy Dolby Atmos playback, DTS:X support and compatibility with a broad range of file formats.\nDesign: The design is where the HW-QS700F truly shines. It features gyro sensors that automatically adjust the speaker configuration for optimal performance whether it\u2019s placed on a table or wall-mounted. The long, angular bar and its compact, cubic wireless sub are surprisingly space-efficient for such a powerful system. It\u2019s slender enough to slide beneath most TV screens or can easily be mounted on the wall underneath one, yet long and deep enough to promise potent sound and a premium finish.\nValue: Considering its blend of performance and features, the Samsung HW-QS700F is a compelling choice. While many soundbars can either be wall-mounted or tabletop-set, few adjust their speaker configuration to optimize performance for both setups. It\u2019s a great option in its own right, but it\u2019s our top pick for wall-mounting \u2013 ideal if you want to take full advantage of that versatility or simply love the option to move it around.\nRead our full Samsung HW-QS700F review\nBest soundbars: comparison chart\nBelow, you'll find a chart showing the scores of every soundbar featured on this list, based on the criteria on which we review them: Features, Performance, Design, Setup & usability and Value. You can sort each column by clicking on its header.\nHow to choose the best soundbar\nThere are several things to consider when you\u2019re looking for the best soundbar.\nThe first is the size. You\u2019ll want to make sure that your soundbar fits under\u2014or next to, depending on your set-up\u2014your TV. For example, the long Sonos Arc soundbar is designed specifically for large screens, so won\u2019t look right with a smaller 50-inch TV. You\u2019ll need to know the size of your current TV and the size of the space you have to fit it and compare those figures to the dimensions listed alongside the soundbar you want to buy.\nYou\u2019ll also want to consider whether you need a Dolby Atmos speaker or not. Dolby Atmos is surround sound technology, placing sounds and voices all around you so that whatever you\u2019re watching or listening to is more immersive. The thing is, Dolby Atmos-enabled soundbars tend to be more expensive. You\u2019ll need to weigh up whether Dolby Atmos sound is worth it for you. Otherwise, consider a capable but cheaper option, like the Sony HT-S2000, our choice for best budget soundbar.\nAnother thing you\u2019ll want to watch out for is the kind of connection you need. You\u2019ll find most modern soundbars have HDMI connectivity, but there's also optical connectivity\u2014so what's the difference? These are two ways that audio is passed from your TV to your soundbar, but HDMI passes high-resolution audio, including Dolby Atmos.\nIf you want a premium, immersive listening experience you\u2019ll want to be sure you have an HDMI connection to use from your soundbar and an HDMI ARC (that's audio return channel) or eARC (enhanced audio return channel, a higher-resolution connection) port on your TV for it to connect to.\nBut this means one of your TV's HDMI ports is used up by the soundbar, so some bars come with HDMI 'passthrough' ports, meaning you can connect a console/set-top box/etc to the soundbar, and it passes the visuals back to your TV. If your TV has few HDMI ports, you'll want a soundbar with this feature.\nThere\u2019s more to think about, but getting the size, audio features and connectivity nailed down early on should make finding the best soundbar for you much easier.\nWhat connection do I need for a soundbar?\nThe best way to connect a soundbar to your TV is with an HDMI cable. You'll need to make sure you have an HDMI port on your soundbar and an HDMI ARC or eARC port on your TV. This allows you to use a cable to connect them.\nAn HDMI port means that the highest quality audio can pass from your TV to your soundbar, like Dolby Atmos.\nIf your TV or soundbar doesn't have HDMI ports, the second best option is an optical. This can still transfer digital sounds, but not the high-resolution ones you'd get with HDMI.\nHowever, you will still get quality audio and an optical connection does work with soundbars and surround sound systems.\nWhat size soundbar should I get?\nYou need to get a soundbar that fits in the space you have available. Some people have their TV mounted and a soundbar could happily be mounted underneath. Others have their TV on a stand and the soundbar can sit in front of it.\nConsider the space you have free but also the size of your TV. A compact soundbar might look silly with a massive screen and vice versa. There are many different-sized soundbars available to suit your TV, so make sure you check the dimensions and match them up.\nCan soundbars do surround sound?\nTrue surround sound means speakers are positioned around you. Some soundbars on this list, like the Samsung Q990D and Hisense AX5125H, also come with a subwoofer and two smaller rear channel speakers, meaning you can place them around your room.\nHowever, other devices with only one soundbar claim to offer surround sound. What this means is they deliver a stereo effect, which seems more like sound is coming from different directions, but isn't.\nMany of the high-end soundbars in this list also have Dolby Atmos built-in. Again, this isn't technically surround sound, but the audio tech is advanced and creates the illusion of immersive sound by bouncing sounds off the walls and ceiling around you.\nAre Dolby Atmos soundbars really worth it?\nAlthough not all the soundbars on this list capture Dolby Atmos as well as a home theatre system, more and more soundbars are supporting Dolby Atmos, making it available to people with all budgets.\nYes, the level of detail you get from a full home theater system compared to soundbars with 'virtual' Atmos or surround soundbars isn't quite as high, Dolby Atmos soundbars are becoming more sophisticated and provide an extra level of immersion to your cinema experience.\nAre soundbars worth it?\nAbsolutely. Even if you don't consider yourself a hardcore cinephile, the best soundbars make a world of difference to your TV watching experience\u2014even the built-in speakers that come with the best TVs just don't do your favorite films, TV shows, and games justice.\nHow much should I spend on a soundbar?\nIt depends on what you're looking for. If you want the very best soundbar technology has to offer, you might be looking at prices of $800 / \u00a3800 / AU$1,000 and upwards.\nHowever, there are lots of fantastic budget soundbars on the market, with some costing less than $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$150. Just bear in mind that you generally get what you pay for, and these budget models probably won't come with premium features like Dolby Atmos, included rear speakers, and hi-res audio support.\nBut, the mid-range market is getting more competitive and it really is easy to get a lot of bang for your buck, with soundbars (on our list above) providing Dolby Atmos and a subwoofer for under $400/\u00a3400/AU$650 becoming more and more common.\nWhere should I put a soundbar?\nYou generally have two options when it comes to soundbar placement: wall-mounting it, or placing in below your TV on your TV cabinet. If your soundbar is quite tall, wall-mounting may be the best option, as it could obscure the IR receiver on your TV, rendering your remote control useless.\nDoes my soundbar brand need to match my TV?\nQuick answer: No, any soundbar can be used with any TV. That\u2019s because all TVs made over the past decade feature HDMI (ARC or eARC) and optical digital connections that output audio signals, and virtually every soundbar will feature both HDMI and optical digital inputs to accept that output. And even if you\u2019re mixing brands, a TV\u2019s HDMI-CEC feature will conveniently let you control the soundbar's volume level using the TV remote control.\nHaving said that, there are instances where combining soundbar and TV brands will yield benefits. Many Samsung soundbars, such as our best overall pick, the Samsung HW-Q800D, for example, support a feature called Q-Symphony that lets you combine the sound output of the TV\u2019s built-in speakers with the soundbar\u2019s output for an enhanced, more spacious audio presentation. And LG soundbars support a similar feature called Wow Orchestra that automatically integrates the soundbar and TV speakers when connected to a compatible LG TV. In both cases, you will experience more powerful, immersive soundstage than you would from just the soundbar working alone.\nAnother benefit to using the same-brand soundbars and TVs is the ability to make a lossless wireless audio connection between the two \u2013 no HDMI cables required. Once again, this feature is supported by select TVs and soundbars from Samsung, which simply calls it Wireless Dolby Atmos, and LG, which calls its version WowCast.\nWhat is Eclipsa Audio, and does my soundbar need it?\nAt the recent CES 2025 trade show, Samsung announced a new immersive audio format meant to compete with Dolby Atmos. Eclipsa Audio was jointly developed by Samsung and Google, and it will be supported by new Samsung TVs and soundbars coming out in 2025. Other TV and soundbar brands didn\u2019t announce any new products with Eclipsa Audio support at CES, but since Google is involved, the format will certainly be supported on future TVs that run the Google TV smart TV platform (Hisense, Sony, TCL, among others).\nEclipsa Audio differs from Dolby Atmos in that it\u2019s a channel-based format. Dolby Atmos soundtracks are \u201cobject-based\u201d mixes comprised of audio \u201cobjects\u201d positioned in 3D space that are scaled to a specific speaker configuration (e.g., 7.1.4 Atmos, 5.1-channel surround, 2-channel stereo). Eclipsa Audio, in contrast, supports up to 28 input channels, which Samsung and Google say is sufficient to provide an immersive 3D audio experience on systems ranging from headphones to multichannel home theaters.\nWhile its license-free status should make it appealing to hardware manufacturers (Dolby, in contrast, charges licensing fees for Dolby Atmos), a key challenge that Eclipsa Audio faces is streaming services support. Dolby Atmos is firmly entrenched in the streaming ecosystem, while Eclipsa Audio is currently only supported by Google-owned YouTube. Given that situation, it\u2019s safe to say that Eclipsa Audio support on soundbars is a non-issue for now, though it\u2019s something to keep an eye on for the future.\nOther soundbars to consider\nWe\u2019ve reviewed several soundbars recently that didn\u2019t make this guide for various reasons, though they are also worth considering.\nBose Smart Ultra Soundbar: An all-in-one competitor to the Sonos Arc, but with a slight lack of heft to its sound and a limited sense of height, this soundbar isn't great enough value to make it into the list. You can read our full Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar review to learn more.\nSennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus: This soundbar really earns its keep with superior delivery of Atmos effects and extended bass. It's well worth consideration if you're looking for something that's a single-unit and if price isn't a worry, but it's expensive, and that's why it hasn't made our list here. Give our full Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus review a read if you want big sound without multiple boxes.\nSennheiser Ambeo Mini: If the price of the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus is too much for your budget, this is a more compact and lower-cost model that provides a \u201cbig\u201d sound, but doesn\u2019t match the Plus when it comes to bass extension and Atmos height effects. It's a similar size to the Sonos Beam Gen 2. We'd choose that model over this one for overall audio quality, but you can read our Sennheiser Ambeo Mini review to learn more.\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 6: Sony's entry-level bar in its Theater lineup for 2025 delivers a powerful performance with awesome bass and full, clear and precise sound. It's also great value for money, but cheaper alternatives keep the Theater 6 off our list: for now. Read our Sony Bravia Theater 6 review for more info.\nNew soundbars arriving in 2025\nBelow are soundbars that we're either in the middle of testing or anticipate testing as 2025 rolls on. Some of these may even make it onto our list!\nFirst up, the Creative Stage Pro 2.1 is a budget-friendly, 2-channel soundbar that has a premium-looking design for cheap. This review is currently in progress.\nThe KEF XIO was recently announced and shown at Audio Advice Live 2025 and delivers a 5.1.2-channel configuration with a sleek, premium design. From what we heard, we were impressed. The KEF XIO joins a competitive all-in-one soundbar market with Marshall and Sonos, but it could be a real winner.\nFrom JBL, we have two entries: the JBL Bar 1000 MK2 and the JBL Bar 1300 MK2, the latter of which is the successor to the JBL Bar 1300X on our list. Two Dolby Atmos packages with rear speakers and wireless subwoofer included, JBL's standout feature is the detachable rear speakers, which can also be attached to the soundbar for easy movement and sound customization. We look forward to testing these out after having raved about the JBL Bar 1300X.\nHow we test the best soundbars\n\u2611\ufe0f More than 2,600 TV and home theater reviews\n\u2611\ufe0f 16 years of product testing\n\u2611\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2611\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWhen we test the best soundbars, we look at categories such as audio performance, design, setup and usability, value for money and features - the same criteria we use for our reviews of soundbars.\nSources: After connecting the soundbar to a TV, we play not only streaming and 4K Blu-ray sources through the TV into the soundbar using the TV\u2019s HDMI eARC connection (as 4K Blu-ray provides better audio quality than streaming), but also music over a Bluetooth wireless connection.\nAudio overview: For audio performance, there are several factors we look at when testing. Soundbars are often used to upgrade a TV's built-in sound, so dialogue clarity and volume are key, as that\u2019s where built-in TV speakers usually struggle the most. We also test bass, mids and trebles by listening to how each range sits within a mix, and also whether the soundstage is wide or narrow.\nSpatial audio: Dolby Atmos spatial audio and surround sound (both virtually and physically through extra speakers) have become common features on soundbars, so we will test the effectiveness and spaciousness of the surround sound, as some people will want a room-filling home theater feel without all the boxes needed for a full AV setup.\nHDMI passthrough: When it comes to higher-end soundbars, we expect 4K 120Hz passthrough on HDMI ports and will test that feature if available. Gamers specifically look for this feature as some TVs don\u2019t have the four HDMI 2.1 ports needed to cover both games consoles and a soundbar.\nMusic: Bluetooth streaming is more commonly being featured on soundbars as manufacturers look to offer an \u2018all-in-one\u2019 solution for movies and music. So, if a soundbar offers that feature, we\u2019ll be sure to test its performance with streamed music. On more premium soundbars, we expect to see Wi-Fi streaming, although this is not always the case.\nSetup and ease-of-use: This is another area we test, as some soundbars carry a plug-in-and-play philosophy whilst others require more in-depth calibration. More soundbars are featuring auto-calibration features to adjust the sound for the room they\u2019re installed in, and this can make a big difference in sound quality. As part of our tests, we\u2019ll listen to a soundbar before and after this calibration to see just how much of a difference it makes.\nConsistency: While we strive to maintain consistency in testing conditions, some of our writers have different setups they\u2019ll be listening in. However, the tests carried out and the testing criteria are the same for all our reviews.\nLatest updates\nAugust 6, 2025\nReplaced the Samsung HW-Q990D with the Samsung HW-Q990F as 'best for Dolby Atmos'.

  "argos_summary": "The LG G5 and Panasonic Z95B, both utilizing the same advanced OLED panel technology, were compared in a recent showdown, revealing notable differences in performance. The LG G5 outshone the Z95B in brightness, achieving peak HDR brightness of 2,268 nits compared to the Z95B's 1,028 nits, although the latter displayed richer colors and deeper blacks when adjusted. While both TVs excelled in color reproduction and contrast, the G5's superior brightness made it more vibrant in default settings, whereas the Z95B required adjustments to match its brightness but offered a more accurate picture overall.",
