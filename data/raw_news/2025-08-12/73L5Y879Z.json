  "description": "Brittney Marie Jones worked for Kelly Clarkson when Brandon Blackstock was the singer\u2019s manager.",
  "content": "Surprising new details are coming to light following the death of Kelly Clarkson\u2019s ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock, last week at 48.\n\nAn obituary for the late talent manager revealed that Blackstock was \u201cbuilding a life\u201d with Clarkson\u2019s former assistant, Brittney Marie Jones, as he lost his battle with cancer.\n\n\u201cBrandon, along with his beautiful and loving partner in life and business, Brittney Marie Jones, started building a life, building companies, and working tirelessly to create Headwaters Livestock Auction and what will live on as his legacy, The Valley View Rodeo in Bozeman, Montana,\u201d his obituary read.\n\nClarkson, meanwhile, was not even mentioned in the lengthy obit \u2013 although her and Blackstock\u2019s two children, daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9, were.\n\n\u201cTo say he was devoted seems clich\u00e9. It feels like an overused word, but it is the correct word. He was a devoted father. His four children were and will always be his greatest love and his greatest legacy,\u201d the obituary continued.\n\n\u201cHe was the son, brother, father, friend, and love you prayed to have in your life,\u201d it added. \u201cAbove all, he was a dreamer.\u201d\n\nBesides River and Remington, Blackstock shared daughter Savannah, 23, and son Seth, 18, with his first wife, Melissa Ashworth, who, like Clarkson, was not mentioned in the obit.\n\nJones was previously married to Greg Goose LaPoint, according to wedding photos on her Facebook page dated September 2021. It is currently unclear when the pair separated.\n\nAs for Blackstock and Clarkson, they married in 2013 and stayed together until the \u201cSince U Been Gone\u201d singer filed for divorce in 2020.\n\nClarkson and her ex settled in 2022 following a long and nasty legal battle and a fight for custody of their children.\n\nAlthough Blackstock initially refused to leave the \u201cStronger\u201d singer\u2019s Montana ranch, the court ordered that he vacate the property in June 2022.\n\nHe purchased a $1.8 million ranch in Butte, Montana, shortly after, per Us Weekly, and founded Valley View Rodeo with Jones working as his executive assistant.\n\n\u201cI successfully assistant managed day to day for artist, Kelly Clarkson under manager, Brandon Blackstock in Los Angeles for music and television,\u201d Jones\u2019 LinkedIn profile read at the time, according to The Sun.\n\n\u201cAfter a change in management for Ms. Clarkson I transitioned to Executive Assistant for Mr. Blackstock\u2019s cattle operation in Montana where I currently run the office and administration work,\u201d it continued. \u201cI also currently fulfill personal assistant duties for Mr. Blackstock.\u201d\n\nBlackstock passed away on Aug. 7 following a lengthy battle with melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer.\n\nHis family announced the devastating news in a statement obtained by The Post.\n\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years,\u201d Blackstock\u2019s loved ones said.\n\n\u201cHe passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d they added. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\n\nSilver Bow County Coroner Dan Hollis later confirmed that the talent manager \u201cpassed away peacefully\u201d from melanoma at his home in Butte, Montana.\n\nBlackstock\u2019s eldest son, Seth, recently remembered his late father as his \u201cbest friend\u201d and \u201chero\u201d in a touching Instagram tribute.\n\nShelby Blackstock, the late talent manager\u2019s half-brother, also broke his silence and remembered Blackstock as \u201cfunny, bright, and full of life.\u201d\n\nClarkson is said to be \u201cdevastated\u201d for two kids after her ex\u2019s tragic passing.\n\n\u201cWhen she found out that he was sick, she remained protective of him for their sake,\u201d an insider told People after his death.\n\n\u201cKelly has always tried to keep things classy,\u201d the source added. \u201cIt became clear earlier this year that Brandon was not doing well. She\u2019s been devastated for the kids.\u201d",

      "text": "Narvel Brandon Blackstock peacefully passed to be with the Lord on the morning of August 7th, 2025, after a brave and courageous 3-year battle with cancer. He was surrounded in his home by his family, who comforted him and lovingly handed him off to his grandparents in heaven, who welcomed him home.\nBrandon was born in Ft. Worth, Texas, on December 16, 1976, to Narvel and Elisa Blackstock. He spent his early childhood in Burleson, Texas before moving to Big Piney, Wyoming for his high school years.\nIn his early adult years, Brandon moved to Nashville and began his career in the music business. He played important roles in shaping the careers of many larger-than-life celebrities and left a lasting impact on everyone who met him. He always had his hand out to pull others up the ladder, to open a door, to make a connection. Many industry insiders have Brandon Blackstock to thank for their opportunities.\nTo know Brandon was to love Brandon. He was a strikingly handsome man\u2026 and if you failed to notice \u2026 he was always happy to remind you!\nAfter more than 20 years in the music business, Brandon found his way back to the mountains and the cowboy way of life he always wanted to live. He found a homestead and a love in Butte, Montana.\nBrandon, along with his beautiful and loving partner in life and business, Brittney Marie Jones, started building a life, building companies, and working tirelessly to create Headwaters Livestock Auction and what will live on as his legacy, The Valley View Rodeo in Bozeman, Montana.\nBrandon didn\u2019t do anything halfway. He charged into life with both guns blazing. He was a cowboy\u2026 and valued the cowboy way of life. He drove a big truck, rode a good horse, and removed his hat when he introduced himself. He was a sharpshooter, a man\u2019s man, and a true gentleman. He loved a hard day\u2019s work that started early and finished late.\nHe had no schedule for when it was time for a cold Coors Light, and his Wrangler jeans were no stranger to a Copenhagen can ring. He rode bulls, but he did not take any. There were no elk, deer, or fish who weren\u2019t slightly afraid of him. He was honest and earnest. He was loyal, hardworking, and loved hard.\nBut never did his star shine brighter than in his role as a father. Nothing mattered to Brandon more than his four beautiful children, Savannah, Seth, River, and Remy. To say he was devoted seems clich\u00e9. It feels like an overused word, but it is the correct word. He was a devoted father. His four children were and will always be his greatest love and his greatest legacy.\nThen came his grandchildren\u2026 Lake, Julie, and LouCasey- who is on the way. They made him a \u201cPa\u201d \u2026 and he was born to be a \u201cPa.\u201d\nHe was the son, brother, father, friend, and love you prayed to have in your life. Above all, he was a dreamer. His passion for his dreams changed lives, whether he was working in Nashville or Montana. He changed lives. He changed communities. He changed us all.\nDeath leaves a heartache no one can heal, but love leaves a memory no one can steal.\nMay our beloved Brandon rest in peace.\nThis is when the cowboy rides away.\nBrandon was preceded in death by his loving grandparents: Gloria and Narvel Leroy Blackstock, Mary Helen Davis and Walter Ritter, and Jacqueline and Clark McEntire.\nBrandon is survived by his four beautiful children, Savannah Blackstock Lee, Seth Blackstock, River Rose Blackstock, and Remington Blackstock. His son-in-law, Quentin Lee. His parents, Narvel Wayne Blackstock and Elisa Gayle Ritter Gilbert. His Stepparents, Reba Nell McEntire, Laura Putty Blackstock, and Daniel Eugene Gilbert. His grandparents Karen and Terry Beattie. His siblings: Shawna Blackstock Meyers and Jason Meyers, Chassidy Blackstock Standefer and Scott Standefer, Shelby McEntire Blackstock and Marissa Blackstock. And his other lifelong brother, Brian Pittman. His grandchildren: Lake Easton Lee, Julianna Rae Lee, and the soon-to-arrive LouCasey Lee.\nIn addition, he had cherished aunts and uncles, beloved nieces and nephews, a slew of cousins\u2026 and countless friends. All of whom are terrified to walk in front of a vehicle for fear of the horn honking.\nAll of Brandon\u2019s friends and loved ones are invited to join the family for his celebration of life on Sunday, August 17th. Please reach out to a family member for service details.\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Brandon Blackstock Memorial Fund at the Montana Stockgrowers Foundation. Link is Here.\nAxelson Funeral & Cremation Services is privileged to care Brandon and his family.\nPlease visit below to leave a condolence or share a memory of Brandon.\nTami O\u2019Connell says\nGod bless to all of you! Working with Brandon, when he bought his home here was nothing short of an extreme pleasure. We are deeply saddened with the loss of such a great man !\nM says\nA life lost too soon.\nLynn McLean says\nI never knew Brandon, but he must have been a man you could never forget. I just wanted his family to know that all of you are in my prayers and I am sending my deepest condolences for your loss. May God help you thru this difficult time. Sending love from NC \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf39\nAllen Brunette jr says\nCondolences to his family and friends. May he rest in peace. Nola\nKim Walters says\nReba, Kelly, River and Remington, my heart is with you all. Prayers are with you in the days ahead."

      "text": "Miss independent, indeed. Kelly Clarkson wanted a \u201cfresh start\u201d following her divorce from Brandon Blackstock \u2014 and New York City seemed to be the perfect place.\nThe \u201cBreakaway\u201d singer, 41, opened up about her recent move to relocate \u201cThe Kelly Clarkson Show\u201d during an interview with USA Today.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be real honest: I thought I was making a horrible decision,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cI knew I needed a fresh start and couldn\u2019t be in L.A. I really wanted to be in Montana, but you can\u2019t really do a show from there quite yet. So I was like, \u2018The only other option would probably be New York.'\u201d\nThe TV personality filed for divorce from Blackstock in June 2020 after nearly seven years of marriage. Their two children River Rose, 9, and Remington, 7, moved with Clarkson as she was awarded primary custody in March 2022.\n\u201cI genuinely love it, and I love that my kids love it,\u201d she continued. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m not living here unless it\u2019s right by the park and really nice for the kids.\u2019\u201d\nThe trio are currently living in a new rental that is \u201csomething nice.\u201d\nClarkson and Blackstock went through a messy split after citing \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d for the reason behind the divorce.\nIn March 2022, a judge approved their divorce settlement, granting Blackstock $115,000 each month in spousal support until January 2024. He will also receive a monthly amount of $45,600 in child support.

Despite their difficult divorce, he\u2019s still the man she loved and still her kids\u2019 father.\u201d\nThey also noted that Clarkson took time off to help care for her ex-husband in his time of need.\nBefore Clarkson, Blackstock was married to Melissa Ashworth from 2001 to 2012. The pair had two kids: daughter Savannah, who\u2019s in her 20s, and son Seth, 18.\nSavannah and her father appeared in several photos together on social media in March, taken during a family outing that included his brother Shelby Blackstock, 35; his mother, McEntire, 70; and her longtime partner, Rex Linn.\nBlackstock\u2019s children with Clarkson also appeared in some of the pictures.\nClarkson and her ex met at a rehearsal for the Academy of Country Music Awards in May 2006 when his dad was her manager and he was married to Ashworth.\nThey reconnected years later at the Super Bowl.\nAfter their wedding, Brandon became Clarkson\u2019s manager. He also managed her former \u201cVoice\u201d co-star Blake Shelton\u2019s career until his divorce from the star.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have hired Brandon to be my manager if I didn\u2019t see first-hand how great he is at that and how much he cares about Blake,\u201d Clarkson told Marie Claire in 2018. \u201cAnd the way that [Blake\u2019s] career has blown up, I would have hired Brandon regardless. He\u2019s really talented at what he does and his mind really does work in a completely different way.\u201d\nThe \u201cBecause of You\u201d singer, who had primary custody of their two children, has opened up about the emotional toll she faced after their split.\n\u201cI think the thing about divorce \u2014 especially having it publicized, and people thinking they know the whole thing \u2014 the hardest part of that is, like, it wasn\u2019t an overnight decision,\u201d she revealed in 2023, a year after the divorce was finalized. \u201cI wanted to make [our marriage] beautiful. I wanted to make it awesome. I wanted to make it everything it possibly could be, and sometimes that just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nClarkson also got brutally honest, telling Apple Music that same year, \u201cI did not handle [the divorce] well.\u201d\nBlackstock became a grandfather in 2022 when Savannah welcomed her son.

Is this his lab or his residence?\u201d Stoner wrote, although they did not reveal their alleged abuser\u2019s name in their memoir.\n\u201cIt was common for entrepreneurs and creatives to have live-work spaces, but this looked nothing like the setup from the photos he showed me,\u201d the Disney Channel alum added.\nStoner claimed that \u201cthere were no chairs to sit on\u201d in the man\u2019s room, and the pair ended up sitting on the floor.\nThey also wrote that the man\u2019s \u201ceyes focused on my crotch,\u201d and they immediately felt \u201cuncomfortable\u201d as things quickly began to escalate.\n\u201cHis eyes burned a hole in my body as he calculated his next move,\u201d Stoner recalled. \u201cSuddenly, his hand reached to grab my crotch, and I swatted him away.\u201d\n\u201cStill on the floor, he wrestled me toward the back corner of the room as I fought back tears,\u201d they continued. \u201cWith one arm, he lifted my whole body onto his bed, which was tucked into a recessed nook with three walls enclosing it.\u201d\nAfter the alleged assailant tried to \u201cremove\u201d Stoner\u2019s clothes, their \u201clegs fused together and I didn\u2019t move.\u201d\n\u201cI briefly exited my body to go into analytical survivor mode: Stay present and list your options,\u201d Stoner detailed. \u201cYou know what might happen. How can you get out of this alive? Your phone is out of reach. If you scream, be might muffle you.\u201d\n\u201cIf you run for the door, he\u2019s massive and will beat you there and maybe make it more painful,\u201d they added.\nDespite feeling a sense of \u201cdread\u201d and \u201cmore and more trapped and unable to function,\u201d the \u201cStep Up\u201d star was able to momentarily get their alleged attacker to stop his sexual assault.\n\u201cLike a child trying to fool his parents, he stopped communicating and pretended to fall asleep instantly, though his body was visibly charged with energy,\u201d they wrote. \u201cI tried to match his nonchalance and deescalate the situation.\u201d\nBut the \u201cSuite Life of Zach and Cody\u201d alum claimed the man then continued his alleged assault.\n\u201cThere was no reasoning or physically fighting my way out. My defenses waned as his hands pulled my pants to my knees, flipping me to the side where I could momentarily see his bare body in my periphery,\u201d Stoner wrote.\n\u201cHe separated my legs like I was an inanimate object,\u201d they added.\nBefore breaking their silence on the alleged sexual assault in their new memoir, Stoner detailed how they were allegedly fired from a kids\u2019 show after first coming out as queer in a 2018 Teen Vogue interview.\nAlthough Stoner did not specify which show they were allegedly fired from, the former Disney Channel star said that it was \u201cdefinitely discrimination.\u201d\n\u201cI did end up getting fired from a children\u2019s show because they felt that I was unsafe, now that they knew I was queer, to be around kids,\u201d they said during the \u201cI\u2019m Literally Screaming\u201d podcast in June 2023.\n\u201cThe, like, beauty far outweighs the hate comments and death threats,\u201d Stoner added at the time. \u201cIt was intimating and also liberating.\u201d"

His brother, race car driver Shelby Blackstock, 35, was one of the first in the family to publicly address his passing.\nTaking to his Instagram on Friday, August 8, Shelby shared several photos of Brandon with his family and doing what he loved.\nSome pictures showed them swimming, while others displayed the tight-knit family on vacation or Brandon on horseback with a smile and an iced cold beer in hand.\n\u201cWords cannot begin to capture the tremendous loss our family has endured. Yesterday, we lost a brother, a father, a grandfather, and a son,\u201d Shelby\u2019s heartfelt post read.\nCalling his half-sibling \u201can irreplaceable part of our family\u2014funny, bright, and full of life,\u201d Shelby said, \u201che will be deeply missed.\u201d\nBrandon and Shelby shared the same father, Narvel Blackstock, 68, but different mothers.\nNarvel had Brandon and two other children with his first wife, Elisa Gayle Ritter, before marrying Reba McEntire in 1989 and welcoming Shelby in 1990.\nNarvel \u2014 who was a talent manager \u2014 and McEntire divorced in 2015.\nDespite their age gap, Shelby said that Brandon \u201ctaught me so much, leaving behind countless cherished memories that I will hold onto forever.\u201d\nHe continued to speak about their bond while paying tribute to his brother.\n\u201cFor every treasured moment we shared, there are so many more we\u2019ll never get to make together, but I know you\u2019ll still be there. Every hunt, every flight, and in the everyday moments of life, I\u2019ll feel your presence,\u201d Shelby told his late sibling. \u201cAnd although it may annoy you, you\u2019ll have to watch me do it all just a little better, a little smoother, and \u2014let\u2019s be honest\u2014 looking far more handsome than you ever could in the process. \ud83d\ude0f.\u201d\nHe concluded: \u201cWe will always miss you, Brandon, and we will never stop loving, remembering and celebrating you.\u201d\nClarkson, who was married to Brandon from 2013 until they split in 2020, and the family kept Brandon\u2019s cancer battle close to the chest.\nHowever, the singer shared that he was suffering from an illness just hours before his passing when she abruptly canceled the August shows of her Las Vegas residency on Wednesday, telling fans she needed to be there for her kids.\nClarkson and Brandon shared two children: daughter River, 11, and son Remington \u201cRemy,\u201d 9.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,\u201d Clarkson wrote on her Instagram, just two days before she was set to take the stage.\n\u201cWhile I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children\u2019s father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them,\u201d the singer added.\n\u201cI am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.\u201d\nThe following day, Brandon\u2019s family announced his death.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years,\u201d his family said in a statement obtained by The Post.\n\u201cHe passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family. We thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time,\u201d they concluded.\nThe singer-songwriter, whose career Brandon managed during their marriage, is said to be \u201cdevastated\u201d for her kids.\nHowever, the show must go on.\nAfter sparking concern with her mystery absences from her talk show earlier this year, \u201cThe Kelly Clarkson Show\u201d will begin filming its seventh season the fall, according to TMZ.\nInsiders familiar with the situation told the outlet that new episodes of Clarkson\u2019s syndicated program are still slated to air in September, with separate sources telling Page Six that the singer\u2019s absences this past season were due to Blackstock\u2019s illness.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been exhausting and so sad,\u201d an insider shared. \u201cKelly has been working so hard, as well as looking after Brandon. Despite their difficult divorce, he\u2019s still the man she loved and still her kids\u2019 father.\u201d\nClarkson filed for divorce in 2020 after nearly seven years of marriage.\nTheir legal battle was messy, with the exes fighting over everything from custody of their children to their Montana ranch.\nClarkson and Brandon\u2019s divorce was finalized in 2022.\nHe was awarded $115,000 each month in spousal support until January 2024 and a monthly amount of $45,600 in child support despite the Grammy winner being granted primary custody of their kids.\nClarkson relocated their children from Los Angeles, Calif., to New York for \u201cThe Kelly Clarkson Show,\u201d while Brandon moved to Butte, Mont.\nThe \u201cSince U Been Gone\u201d singer was dedicated to making sure River and Remy had a good relationship with their father, especially before his death.\n\u201cWhen she found out that he was sick, she remained protective of him for their sake,\u201d a source told People after his passing.\n\u201cKelly has always tried to keep things classy,\u201d they added. \u201cIt became clear earlier this year that Brandon was not doing well. She\u2019s been devastated for the kids.\u201d\nBrandon also leaves behind two adult children \u2014 Savannah, 23, and Seth, 18 \u2014 from his first marriage to Melissa Ashworth, whom he divorced in 2012.\nOne month before his death, Savannah revealed she was pregnant with her second child."
