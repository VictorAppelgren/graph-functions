  "title": "Check out this great movie before it leaves Amazon Prime Video next week (August 2025)",
  "description": "Judgment at Nuremberg is one of the best courtroom dramas in the long history of Hollywood entertainment.",
  "content": "One of the best ways to figure out what to watch next on a streaming service is to see which movies are leaving soon. Amazon has a deep bench, but titles leave the service every month, making it difficult to keep track of which movies are available where.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for something to watch before the end of August, you should start with Judgment at Nuremberg. The movie, released 15 years after the end of World War II, is about the trial at Nuremberg that determined whether those in the Nazi regime could be prosecuted for following orders. Here are three reasons you should check it out.\n\nWe also have guides to the best new movies to stream, the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best movies on Amazon Prime Video, the best movies on HBO Max, and the best movies on Disney+.\n\nIt remains as timely as ever\n\nThe movie is careful to remind viewers of just how horrific World War II was, but what\u2019s just as important here is how a person\u2019s individual morality should weigh against the orders they\u2019ve been asked to carry out. If you are told to do something you know is wrong, what is your recourse? And what does it mean for a country itself to have been complicit in horrific acts?\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable thing about Judgment at Nuremberg is the sheer tonnage of star power that\u2019s on display in the film. In addition to Spencer Tracy, the film\u2019s star, the cast also includes Maximillian Schell, Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, and William Shatner. Some of the actors play smaller parts, but each one delivers some of the best work of their careers, especially Tracy and Lancaster. No actor feels out of place in the entire ensemble.\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable thing about Judgment at Nuremberg is the sheer tonnage of star power that\u2019s on display in the film.

No actor feels out of place in the entire ensemble.\n\nIt\u2019s more riveting than you might expect\n\nJudgment at Nuremberg is a three-hour courtroom drama, it\u2019s true, which means that most of its scenes take place in small rooms, and the topics they discuss in those rooms are often fairly legalistic.\n\nThanks to a slew of outstanding performances, though, Judgment at Nuremberg is pretty gripping, in part because its central character, Judge Daniel Heywood, seems to be genuinely torn about whether these men should be blamed for the crimes they carried out while serving their country. It\u2019s a fascinating question, and one that Judgment at Nuremberg works hard to present every side of.\n\nYou can watch Judgment at Nuremberg on Amazon Prime Video.",

      "text": "Max continues to flesh out its library to ensure its place as an ideal mainstream platform for streaming the best movies. Diversity in its movie selection remains the service\u2019s greatest asset, giving audiences virtually limitless hours\u2019 worth of movies spread across every genre imaginable.\nThere are bound to be handfuls of movies available for every type of fan, from gangster dramas and sci-fi to comedy and romance. Still, Max\u2019s diverse selection could overwhelm newcomers with the sheer number of choices. This guide is updated monthly to help alleviate the choice paralysis and highlight recent additions of some of the best movies on Max.\nIn need of some more streaming recommendations? We also have guides to the best new movies to stream, the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best movies on Amazon Prime Video, and the best movies on Disney+ that are worth looking through.\n-\nThe Shining1980\n-\nThe Goonies1985\nThe Shining (1980)\nThe Shining received retrospective acclaim as one of the best horror movies for its visceral mix of supernatural terror and Jack\u2019s unraveling psyche. It\u2019s one of the best examples of a character profile in the genre, largely thanks to Nicholson\u2019s performance, which makes the protagonist\u2019s deeply disturbing turn feel convincing.\nThe Goonies (1985)\nNostalgic audiences wanting a lighter cult-classic movie don\u2019t need to look much further than The Goonies. Richard Donner\u2019s film sees a group of kids from Astoria, Oregon, find themselves on a sweeping treasure hunt for a 17th-century pirate\u2019s treasure.\nThis ambitious adventure is sparked by the group\u2019s efforts to save their houses from foreclosure, but a criminal family looks to beat them to One-Eyed Willy\u2019s fortune. The Goonies has all the upbeat, adventurous atmosphere that audiences would expect from the Superman director. That\u2019s emphasized further by Steven Spielberg\u2019s involvement as a writer, and it\u2019s all grounded by lively performances by its young ensemble cast.\nLogan (2017)\nMax isn\u2019t typically known for having Marvel movies, but subscribers can stream the acclaimed Logan on the platform. James Mangold (Ford v Ferrari, A Complete Unknown) directs this X-Men tale set within a continuity in a not-so-distant future. The titular Logan (Hugh Jackman) finds his Wolverine past calling him, as he and a sickly Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) must protect a young mutant named Laura from being hunted by the head of a biotech corporation.\nLogan is beloved as the best X-Men movie to date. Jackman and Stewart give some of the most emotionally impactful and nuanced performances as their characters, and they\u2019re backed by top-notch direction and cinematography. The movie adopts elements of dystopic sci-fi, neo-noir, and Western genres for an appropriately gritty yet heartfelt finish to Wolverine\u2019s arc.\nAftersun (2022)\nFans of Paul Mescal (Gladiator II) can see him in an emotional and touching light in Aftersun. Directed by Charlotte Wells in her feature film debut, it tells the story of an 11-year-old Sophie (Frankie Corio) on vacation with her father (Mescal) in a Turkish resort. In the present, Sophie (Celia Rowlson-Hall) recalls the heartwarming and somber memories with him while struggling to come to terms with her memories and the sides of her father she didn\u2019t know.\nAftersun garnered critical acclaim for its deeply moving and grounded story, complemented by Mescal and Corio\u2019s mesmerizing dynamic. Director Charlotte Wells bases the plot loosely on her own childhood experiences, using them to convey how difficult it is to grapple with the imperfections of memories one has of one\u2019s parents and who they truly were.\nThe Terminator (1984)\nDirector James Cameron is responsible for some of the best Hollywood sci-fi movies. The original Terminator still stands as a cinematic milestone, following Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s cyborg killing machine as he\u2019s sent back to 1984 from 2029. He\u2019s tasked with preventing Sarah Connor\u2019s (Linda Hamilton) future son from stopping Skynet\u2014a hostile A.I.\u2014from wiping out humanity.\nThe Terminator received critical acclaim, particularly in retrospect, for the tense action set pieces and Schwarzenegger\u2019s chilling performance as the cybernetic villain. The action\u2019s relentless pacing and the sense of dread the titular Terminator creates on-screen help the movie stand the test of time as one of the best sci-fi thrillers.\nFriday (1995)\nFor a breezy, entertaining movie night, Friday should get plenty of laughs from audiences. The F. Gary Gray-directed comedy revolves around the antics of Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and Smokey (Chris Tucker). The pair find themselves in trouble in more ways than one, as the unemployed friends owe money to a drug dealer while faced with their neighborhood\u2019s bully.\nFriday is a great \u201890s buddy-comedy movie carried by the liveliness of its co-lead performances. Their oddball misadventures are perfect for fans of stoner comedies, and it\u2019s hard not to get on board with Tucker\u2019s frenetic energy.\nGoodFellas (1990)\nMartin Scorsese\u2019s catalog is an embarrassment of riches for crime-drama fans, and Goodfellas is among his best works. The movie sees Ray Liotta in the role of Henry Hill, a real-life mobster who joined the mafia from a young age and rose through its ranks. However, as Hill navigates the criminal organization\u2019s cutthroat hierarchy, his life begins to unravel painfully.\nPacked with a tremendous ensemble, including the legendary Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in supporting roles, Goodfellas is an epic gangster-themed drama in scope. Scorsese once again depicts the ruthlessness of organized crime, making Hill\u2019s inevitable fall from grace much more visceral.\nGhostbusters (1984)\nFor an 1980s throwback, director Ivan Reitman\u2019s original Ghostbusters more than warrants a watch today. Starring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis, this story sees the trio go around New York as ghost catchers. The group is in for a massive undertaking, as cellist Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) hires them to rid her of supernatural entities.\nGhostbusters undoubtedly satisfies as a nostalgia trip for affectionate fans, but the film still stands on its own comedic and visual merits. The zany special effects and endlessly quotable dialogue make this a must-watch sci-fi comedy.\nCarrie (1976)\nIf movie fans are feeling brave, Max is also home to plenty of terrific horror movies. Among them is Brian De Palma\u2019s Carrie, an adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s book, telling the story of an ostracized teenage girl. All of her tormenters would come to rue this soon enough, as Carrie begins to develop formidable supernatural powers.\nCarrie is one of the best movies of the \u201870s, regardless of genre. It\u2019s also one of the most influential supernatural horror films. The movie is ruthless and gruesome, creating one of the most iconic bloodbath sequences in horror. However, it also touches on darker coming-of-age themes with a humanized perspective.\nFinal Destination (2000)\nMoviegoers should check out the original Final Destination on Max now that the sixth film, Final Destination Bloodlines, is set for release this May. Directed by James Wong, the story revolves around a group of teenagers who manage to cheat death after a would-be-lethal plane crash.\nThey survive thanks to Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) having a premonition of the disaster, but now Death itself is set to claim the lives of the teenagers meant to die in the accident. Final Destination received mostly negative reviews upon release, but it eventually became a 2000s horror cult classic. The cheesy teen-themed horror feel was seen as charming, along with its inventive premise of Death returning to claim what\u2019s been promised.\nDredd (2012)\nDredd is one of the most underrated comic book movies of the 2010s, adapting the grim antihero for the big screen. The story is set in the year 2080, with most of the U.S. plunged into a hellish dystopia after a nuclear war. The titular Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) acts as judge, jury, and executioner of Mega-City One. Alongside his rookie partner Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), Dredd must take down the resident drug lord (Lena Headey) of a 200-story apartment complex.\nWhile the movie was unfortunately a box office dud, Dredd is a gripping comic book film and dystopic sci-fi thriller. As fans can see now in The Boys, Karl Urban has the acting chops to portray the grit of a character like Judge Dredd.\nTaxi Driver (1976)\nOne of auteur director Martin Scorsese\u2019s most revered movies, Taxi Driver, is a must for fans of crime movies. Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, the Marine veteran and taxi driver with a bleak perspective on life as he works night shifts. As the nights go on, Travis\u2019 mental state steadily erodes, and he feels compelled to become a violent vigilante.\nTaxi Driver is widely acclaimed as one of the best neo-noir films in cinema history, giving audiences an intense character-driven story from Travis\u2019 POV. It\u2019s easy for viewers to get engrossed and feel the dread of his inevitable descent into madness.\nBatman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993)\nOne of the most important movies in Batman\u2019s mythos, Mask of the Phantasm, is back on Max. Co-directed by Batman: The Animated Series creators Eric Radomski and Bruce Timm, it sees the Dark Knight track down an elusive vigilante picking off Gotham\u2019s mob bosses one by one. Meanwhile, the story alternates with Bruce Wayne\u2019s attempts to reconcile with his old flame, Andrea Beaumont, who is back in the city.\nBatman: Mask of the Phantasm is widely beloved and makes a case for being DC\u2019s best animated movie \u2014 DCAU continuity or otherwise. Supported by masterclass performances by Kevin Conroy as the hero, Mark Hamill as the Joker, and Dana Delany as Andrea, the film delves into the nuances of Bruce\u2019s motives while mixing action and tragic romance.\nMad Max (1979)\nThe first in what would become one of the best dystopian film series, Mad Max remains a late-1970s classic today. In a not-so-distant-future Australia, director George Miller depicts a world where society has collapsed and violent gangs rule the landscape. Enter \u201cMad\u201d Max Rockatansky, a former police officer who attempts to fight the forces that laugh in the face of justice.\nWhile Mad Max initially received polarizing reviews for its brand of over-the-top violence, retrospective reception praised Miller\u2019s gritty, imaginative take on a postapocalyptic Australia. Accompanied by elaborate stunts and action sequences that hold up, Mad Max is a must-watch for action movie fans.\nThe Usual Suspects (1995)\nDirected by Bryan Singer and written by current Mission: Impossible director Christopher McQuarrie, The Usual Suspects is a riveting crime story. The plot centers around the recount of con man Roger \u201cVerbal\u201d Kint (Kevin Spacey) as he tries to convince the feds that a legendary figure dubbed Keyser S\u00f6ze drew his crew into a daring heist job.\nWhat follows is a twisting tale about how most of Verbal\u2019s crew were killed in a boat explosion and massacre. The Usual Suspects is a gripping story from beginning to end, largely praised for its unique narrative approach. Through flashbacks and narrated scenes, Usual Suspects\u2019 clever use of non-linear storytelling builds up to one of the best plot twists in the medium.\nSuper/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story (2024)\nCreature Commandos on Max may have soft-launched James Gunn and Peter Safran\u2019s DC Universe, but Warner Bros.\u2019 superhero division already has a powerful documentary film to its name. Co-directed by Ian Bonh\u00f4te and Peter Ettedgui, Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story chronicles the eponymous Superman actor\u2019s rise to fame, tragic injury, and compassionate activism.\nAside from playing one of the most aspirational characters in pop culture, Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story does a superb job of recounting the late actor\u2019s heroics off the silver screen. From his loving family to social activism for disability health care research and rights, Super/Man is one of the most sincere documentaries of 2024.\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice (2024)\nSequels to decades-old movies are far from novel at this point, but Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is worth the watch. On top of Tim Burton returning to the director\u2019s chair, this sequel sees Winona Ryder\u2019s Lydia Deetz, now grown and a mother, struggle to keep her family together in the aftermath of a tragedy.\nThe story takes a zanier turn when her daughter Astrid (Jenna Ortega) accidentally opens a portal to the afterlife \u2014 all while Michael Keaton\u2019s Beetlejuice still haunts Lydia. It would have been easy for a movie like Beetlejuice Beetlejuice to become nothing more than nostalgia pandering, but this sequel feels like a welcome comeback. Burton\u2019s eye for ghoulish, practical visuals and larger-than-life characters shines even 30-plus years after the original.\nDune: Part Two (2024)\nFollowing director Denis Villeneuve\u2019s successful first adaptation of Frank Herbert\u2019s sci-fi novel, he raises the bar with Dune: Part Two. Adapting roughly the second half of Herbert\u2019s book, this sequel sees Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica, become more intertwined with the Fremen people of Arrakis. Together, they mount an offensive against the incursions of the ruthless House Harkonnen.\nDune: Part Two elevates everything that made the first movie successful, from its breathtaking scope, visuals, drama, and stellar ensemble performances. Villeneuve continues to demonstrate his intimate knowledge of the acclaimed source material, vividly giving this gritty sci-fi world life.\nUnstoppable (2010)\nFor some high-octane action, 2010\u2019s Unstoppable is a must-watch highlight from that decade. Starring Chris Pine as train conductor Will Colson and Denzel Washington as railroad engineer Frank Barnes, it follows the pair\u2019s attempts to stop a runaway freight train.\nUnstoppable is a great example of a movie that excels in its simplicity. The straightforward premise offers plenty of high-stakes thrills, and it\u2019s led by the magnetic performances of its co-leads. Unstoppable knows exactly what it wants to be \u2014 a loud, nerve-wracking thriller \u2014 which is always an admirable quality in an action movie.\nIt (2017)\nLooking for more Stephen King-inspired movies for the Halloween season? Wedl, 2017\u2019s It adaptation is a fitting choice. Directed by Andy Muschietti (The Flash, Mama), the story follows seven kids stalked by the horrific titular entity (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) that takes the form of \u201cPennywise the Clown.\u201d\nOn top of the supernatural terror the children endure, they\u2019ll also be forced to do some serious introspection. Muschietti\u2019s, It is praised as one of the best Stephen King adaptations, with the visuals and Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s chilling performance being the highlights. In addition, the movie\u2019s young ensemble does a great job of being the story\u2019s emotional core.\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)\nThe Harry Potter franchise remains a blockbuster property, and the film series holds up. Director Chris Columbus\u2019 sophomore entry, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, chronicles the young protagonist\u2019s (Daniel Radcliffe) second year at Hogwarts.\nWith Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) by his side, Harry faces a monstrosity unleashed from the chamber by the Heir of Salazar Slytherin. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was well-received for its tasteful adaptation of the book and the young cast\u2019s endearing performances. The story is notably darker than its predecessor, but thanks to the aforementioned cast, Columbus\u2019 deft direction, and stunning visuals, Chamber of Secrets remains accessible to all audiences.\nThe Martian (2015)\nBizarre comedy-centric accolades aside, The Martian is a compelling sci-fi movie. The Ridley Scott movie stars Matt Damon as astronaut Dr. Mark Watney as he struggles to survive amid Mars\u2019 grueling environment. The astronaut and botanist is left behind to fend for himself and is presumed dead for a time by NASA.\nThe Martian is one of director Ridley Scott\u2019s best movies of the modern era, lauded for its breathtaking visuals and gripping plot. Even with a solid premise, it\u2019s hard to imagine this sci-fi drama without Damon\u2019s tension-filled performance, which sells Watney\u2019s dire situation.\nSherlock Holmes (2009)\nBetween his Oscar-winning performance in Oppenheimer and his upcoming MCU return as Dr. Doom, Robert Downey Jr. remains among the biggest names in Hollywood. Outside of historical figures and comic book icons, he also played Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s detective in 2009\u2019s Sherlock Holmes. Directed by Guy Ritchie, Sherlock Holmes follows the eccentric detective and his companion Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) as they attempt to stop a seemingly supernatural conspiracy.\nSerial killer Lord Henry Blackwood (Mark Strong) attempts to use occult magic to control all of Britain. Sherlock Holmes\u2019 character invites countless revisions, and Ritchie\u2019s take balances the right amount of action, mystery, and humor to stand out. It\u2019s the perfect combination for Downey Jr., which is why it\u2019s no surprise this is one of his most memorable roles.\nHow to Train Your Dragon (2010)\nWhile DreamWorks doesn\u2019t quite have the same prestige status as Pixar, movies like How to Train Your Dragon prove it\u2019s still a big name in animation. Directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, and based on Cressida Cowell\u2019s children\u2019s book, the movie is set in a fantasy world where Vikings have a hostile dynamic with dragons.\nThat changes when the teenage Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), in trying to become a dragon slayer, befriends one he names Toothless. How to Train Your Dragon earns its acclaim and is one of DreamWorks\u2019 best movies to date. The film\u2019s animation quality holds up remarkably, and its story is surprisingly dramatic and insightful thanks to its theme of humanity\u2019s relationship with wildlife.\nLady Bird (2017)\nGreta Gerwig earned mainstream success with last year\u2019s summer blockbuster Barbie, but her earlier catalog has other terrific movies like Lady Bird. Directed and written by Gerwig, the story follows a high school senior named Christine McPherson (Saoirse Ronan) who has a dysfunctional relationship with her mother, Marion (Laurie Metcalf).\nThe strong-willed and artistic Christine sees her dynamic with her mother further strained as she prepares to attend college. Lady Bird received critical acclaim for its deeply resonating plot. Gerwig\u2019s direction and writing combined with Ronan and Metcalf\u2019s charged performances make this an impactful coming-of-age drama.\nThe Iron Claw (2023)\nA24\u2019s The Iron Claw is a tense biographical sports drama. Directed by Sean Durkin, it depicts the successes and tragedies of the Von Erich family in their pursuit of glory in professional wrestling. Starring Zac Efron as Kevin, The Bear\u2018s Jeremy Allen White as Kerry, Harris Dickinson as David, and Stanley Simons as Mike, the movie portrays the brothers\u2019 collective suffering from their father Fritz\u2019s (Holt McCallany) grooming for the sport.\nThe Iron Claw earned immense praise for its emotionally raw storytelling and tasteful dramatization of the Von Erich family\u2019s heart-wrenching story. Zac Efron\u2019s performance was particularly lauded, cited as his career-best role and one of the most passionately played in the movie.\nThe Lighthouse (2019)\nDirector Robert Eggers\u2019 The Lighthouse is one of the most inventive dramas in recent years. The plot follows 19th-century lighthouse keepers Ephraim Winslow (The Batman 2\u2032s Robert Pattinson) and Thomas Wake (Poor Things\u2018 Willem Dafoe). The two find themselves stranded on a remote New England outpost after a devastating storm, with their mental faculties deteriorating from the isolation.\nThe Lighthouse earned widespread acclaim for its brutally tense atmosphere and commanding co-leading performances from Pattinson and Dafoe. The movie is an inspired mash-up of various genres, ranging from drama and thriller to psychological horror.\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001)\nThe Harry Potter franchise\u2019s global juggernaut status is partly due to the film series\u2019 critical success. Directed by Chris Columbus, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone \u2014 or Philosopher\u2019s Stone, alternatively \u2014 adapts the first book in author J.K. Rowling\u2019s acclaimed series. After living in his abusive uncle and aunt\u2019s house, young Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) discovers he\u2019s a powerful wizard and embarks on his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\nHe meets various characters, including his endearing friends Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint). Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone was praised for its tasteful balance of faithfulness to the book and condensing it to fit into a satisfying feature-length runtime. More than that, its main cast was lauded for their charm and heartfelt performances.\nScott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010)\nWhile it was a box-office bomb when it released in 2010, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World developed into a cult classic thanks to its strong critical reception. Director Edgar Wright\u2019s take on this universe does justice to Bryan Lee O\u2019Malley\u2019s comic book series, telling the story of musician Scott Pilgrim\u2019s (Michael Cera) efforts to win a music competition and a record deal.\nAt the same time, Scott has to fend off the seven evil exes of his girlfriend, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Though it has a straightforward plot, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World elevates it with colorful comic book-like imagery and lively performances. The movie leans into its larger-than-life nature and is complemented by its quirky humor.\nRoboCop (1987)\nArguably actor Peter Weller\u2019s most iconic theatrical role, 1987\u2019s RoboCop is a classic sci-fi action movie of the era. The Paul Verhoeven-directed story follows police officer Alex Murphy (played by Weller) in a crime-infested Detroit set in a dystopic sci-fi future. The officer is murdered in a gang attack but is later revived by the corporation Omni Consumer Products to experiment with their titular \u201cRoboCop\u201d initiative.\nTogether with Ridley Scott\u2019s 1982 film Blade Runner, RoboCop helped bolster the cyberpunk subgenre, with the movie having an impressive level of nuance. While the cartoonishly over-the-top action certainly draws appeal on its own, RoboCop uses its titular cyborg protagonist to explore themes of what it means to lose one\u2019s humanity, as well as a bold critique of corporate corruption and the real-world economic policies driving the U.S. at the time.\nThe Lego Batman Movie (2017)\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)\nCementing the series\u2019 status as one of the most outstanding film trilogies ever made, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a triumphant finish for Peter Jackson\u2019s tenure in Middle-earth. The film continues with Bilbo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) journeying to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom.\nMeanwhile, the remaining heroes, including Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and Legolas (Orlando Bloom), amass an army to battle with Sauron. Winning an astonishing 11 Academy Awards out of 11 nominations, The Return of the King was emphatically acclaimed for its faithfulness to Tolkien\u2019s source material, stunning visuals, and powerfully emotional payoff."

      "text": "Idris Elba and John Cena starred in Heads of State, an action comedy that premiered on Prime Video last month. Elba and Cena are billed as the film\u2019s top stars. However, AI tools showed that the film\u2019s third lead, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, was the real force behind the movie\u2019s success.\nAmazon MGM Studios bypassed theaters for Heads of State and released it directly to Prime Video on July 2, 2025. The decision to head to streaming paid off. Per Deadline, the action comedy registered over 75 million worldwide Prime Video viewers in just over one month.\nHeads of State is the fourth-most-watched Amazon MGM Studios film on Prime Video of all time, behind Red One, The Accountant 2, and The Tomorrow War.\nOne could assume that global stars like Elba and Cena would be the reason behind the surge in viewership. According to AI tools, Chopra Jonas was the biggest draw.\nPer Variety, representatives for Chopra Jonas used Grok and ChatGPT to measure and analyze viewer sentiment. Using an AI breakdown based on volume, headlines, and quoting intensity, Chopra Jonas had a buzz rate of around 50% to 60% on the film. The same formula had Elba and Cena between 20% and 25%, nearly half the amount generated by Chopra Jonas.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she would normally be credited for [the film\u2019s success] because she\u2019s not the lead. She\u2019s not a \u2018Head of State,'\u201d Anjula Acharia, Chopra Jonas\u2019 manager, said to Variety. But in this case, the data doesn\u2019t lie.\u201d\nThe data support Chopra Jonas\u2019 huge crossover appeal thanks to her career as a Bollywood actress.\nAI is changing how Hollywood operates. Saying AI around someone in the business will almost always generate a negative reaction. Most people fear that increased AI will lead to the loss of jobs.\nAcharia, conversely, believes AI can help gather data points to use during contract negotiations for future roles.\n\u201cYou can really see where the cultural heat is building, and it gives you that data really fast,\u201d Acharia added about using AI tools to help her client.\nHeads of State is now on Prime Video."

The duo is ambushed by master criminal Zoe (Keke Palmer) and her team of goons.\nZoe forces Russell and Travis to help execute a casino heist that will net her $60 million. For Russell, getting through the shift with Travis is difficult enough. Add in the fact that he must work for a thief, and Russell is in for a long day of surprises.\nThe Map That Leads to You (2025)\nOuter Banks\u2019 Madelyn Cline and Riverdale\u2019s KJ Apa play two young lovers on a European excursion in The Map That Leads to You. While on a train with her two best friends, Heather (Cline) meets the handsome Jack (Apa). The two hit it off and embark on a journey to visit a list of places Jack\u2019s grandfather wrote about in a journal.\nAs their time together comes to an end, Heather and Jack must decide if their connection can survive while separated halfway across the world. The Map That Leads to You premieres on August 20 on Prime Video.\nPulp Fiction (1994)\nQuentin Tarantino changed cinema forever with his groundbreaking crime saga Pulp Fiction. Told via nonlinear narrative, Pulp Fiction depicts several interconnected stories scattered across Los Angeles.\nOne of the vignettes follows two hitmen, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), who work for gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). In another segment, Vincent must take Marsellus\u2019 wife, Mia (Uma Thurman), to dinner. Meanwhile, boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) finds himself in a precarious situation.\nThe Accountant 2 (2025)\nOne of the world\u2019s most brilliant minds, who moonlights as a vigilante, returns for a sequel in The Accountant 2. Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is an accountant for some of the world\u2019s most nefarious criminals. When the body of Raymond King (J.K. Simmons) is found with \u201cfind the accountant\u201d on his arm, U.S. Treasury Deputy Director Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) asks Christian to help find the killer.\nKing was trying to track down a Salvadoran family and went to an assassin for help.

Wicked is the first of a two-part adaptation. Part two, Wicked: For Good, premieres later in 2025.\nThe Fire Inside (2024)\nThe Fire Inside is based on the true story of Olympic gold medalist, Claressa \u201cT-Rex\u201d Shields (Ryan Destiny), the first American woman to do so in boxing\u2026 twice. That\u2019s not a spoiler for the movie, because Claressa\u2019s Olympic triumph isn\u2019t the ultimate destination, it\u2019s just a stop along the way. The film movingly conveys Claressa\u2019s connection with her coach, Jason Crutchfield (Bryan Tyree Henry), and there\u2019s an understated bond between them. As much as Claressa has to fight her battles in the ring, she\u2019s got a lot of struggles in her daily life as well. Winning Olympic gold hasn\u2019t given Claressa the access to endorsements or lucrative deals that could pull her up to another level. All she ultimately has is her faith in herself and the support of the people closest to her.\nHomefront (2013)\nJason Statham doesn\u2019t always get surrounded by a strong supporting cast in his action flicks, but he\u2019s got a good lineup of colleagues with him in Homefront. Statham plays Phil Broker, a former DEA agent who has retired to raise his daughter, Maddy Broker (Izabela Vidovic), in peace.\nThat peace doesn\u2019t last long as Phil runs afoul of Cassie Bodine (Kate Bosworth), the mother of one of Maddy\u2019s classmates. Cassie enlist her brother, Morgan \u201cGator\u201d Bodine (James Franco), to get Phil out of the way. And through Gator, Phil\u2019s location is leaked to some of the most dangerous men he put away in the DEA.\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (2023)\nEthan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and Grace (Hayley Atwell) have a meet-cute in Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning that\u2019s worthy of any rom-com. They might have even had a romantic spark if she wasn\u2019t trying to steal something he needs to save the world. Regardless, Ethan and Grace spend a lot of time joined at the wrist \u2014 sometimes literally \u2014 because Ethan\u2019s racing against time to stop an AI known as The Entity.\nThis time, even the U.S. government doesn\u2019t want Ethan and his team to succeed, because if America can control The Entity then it will control the future. All of the other countries have the same mentality, but The Entity is the one really in control. And its reach extends to the real world, where it forces Ethan to make life-and-death decisions. He knows The Entity needs to be destroyed, but it may already be too late for that.\nThe Peanut Butter Falcon (2019)\nShia LaBeouf has one of his most moving performances in The Peanut Butter Falcon, which casts him as a crab catcher named Tyler. After literally burning his bridges with his former colleagues, Tyler hides out in the wilderness for their retribution. That\u2019s where he meets Zak (Zack Gottsagen), a young man with Down syndrome who is also on the run after escaping a facility.\nZak and Tyler emotionally bond, and they decide to stick together to help the former achieve his dream of learning how to wrestle under the legendary Salt Water Redneck (Thomas Haden Church).

And when she sees how well Zak and Tyler are together, she has to question whether bringing Zak home is the right move.\nAnother Simple Favor (2025)\nAfter the events of A Simple Favor, Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick) would have to be crazy to have anything to do with Emily Nelson (Blake Lively) ever again. Crazy or desperate. Stephanie\u2019s blip of fame since sending Emily to prison is largely burned out in Another Simple Favor. When Emily is released from prison and invites Stephanie to her destination wedding in Italy, she reluctantly accepts.\nStephanie isn\u2019t the only one from Emily\u2019s old life invited to the wedding. Emily\u2019s ex-husband, Sean Townsend (Henry Golding), and her mother, Margaret McLanden (Elizabeth Perkins), also made the trip. Regardless, Stephanie is expecting a double cross from Emily. And she\u2019s right to be suspicious, but the dangerous twist won\u2019t necessarily come the way she expects.\nConclave (2024)\nThe pope is dead in Conclave, meaning his successor must be chosen. Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes), the dean of the College of Cardinals, will oversee the election of the next pope. And it\u2019s more than just a choice between the four major candidates. Whoever is chosen will shape the future of the Catholic Church itself.\nThe election may take place behind closed doors in Vatican City, but the secrets that emerge could end the careers of some and potentially spark more scandal in the church. There\u2019s a surprising amount of intrigue in the selection process, and the film also boasts a stellar supporting cast that includes Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, and Isabella Rossellini.\nGladiator II (2024)\nIt only took 24 years for a sequel to Gladiator to reach theaters. Russell Crowe\u2019s character remains dead, but Lucius Verus Aurelius (Paul Mescal) carries on the tradition of losing his family and being sold into slavery in Gladiator II. Connie Nielsen reprises her role as Lucilla from the first film, and she was the one who sent Lucius away for his own safety.\nIn Lucius\u2019 absence, Rome is ruled by not one but two mad emperors: Geta (Joseph Quinn) and Caracalla (Fred Hechinger). As Lucius climbs the ranks of the gladiators, a former slave named Macrinus (Denzel Washington) wants to use him to get the emperors out of the way. But Lucius is his own man, like his father before him.\nG20 (2025)\nAction hero Presidents aren\u2019t a new thing, but Viola Davis\u2019 character in G20 might be the first female action hero president. As far as President Danielle Sutton (Davis) knew, this year\u2019s G20 summit in South Africa was supposed to be an ordinary meeting of leaders from across the globe.\nThe Boys\u2018 Antony Starr co-stars in the film as Rutledge, the leader of the terrorists who take the security team by surprise and capture the world leaders. President Sutton manages to get free. And if she wants to save her family and her fellow leaders, then she\u2019ll need to get her hands dirty and do it herself.\nVal (2021)\nEven years before Val Kilmer became a star in Hollywood, he kept home movies from his childhood to his teens and beyond. It was the story of Kilmer\u2019s life that no one had seen until directors Ting Poo and Leo Scott put it all together as Val.\nThis documentary is also a family affair for Kilmer, his ex-wife Joanne Whalley, and their children, Mercedes and Jack. Since Kilmer had lost his voice during his battle with throat cancer, Jack Kilmer stepped in to read the words written by his father as he looked back at everything he went through to become the man he wanted to be.\nHolland (2025)\nWhat\u2019s eating Nancy Vandergroot (Nicole Kidman) in Holland? She\u2019s got a great thing going in this small town with overtly Dutch roots. Nancy\u2019s got a fine husband, Fred Vandergroot (Matthew Macfadyen), and their son, Harry (Jude Hill), is unusually well-behaved.\nIt\u2019s so perfect that the slightest imperfection alerts Nancy that maybe things aren\u2019t so rosy after all. For an optometrist, Fred sure takes a lot of out-of-town trips. Nancy\u2019s pretty sure that means Fred\u2019s having an affair, and she turns to her new friend, Dave Delgado (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal), to help her prove it. What they find isn\u2019t what Nancy expected, which turns her world upside down.\nTransformers One (2024)\nTransformers One is the origin story of the franchise\u2019s leading hero and villain: Optimus Prime and Megatron. At this point in their history, Optimus is known as Orion Pax (Chris Hemsworth), while the future Megatron is D-16 (Brian Tyree Henry). Both are miners on Cybertron, and good friends as well.\nAfter befriending B-127 (Keegan-Michael Key) and their former boss, Elita-1 (Scarlett Johansson), Orion and D-16 discover that Cybertron\u2019s ruler, Sentinal Prime (Jon Hamm), has betrayed the planet to their enemies. Orion and D-16 are both outraged by this revelation, but they aren\u2019t on the same page about how to handle it. That leads to the beginning of a rift between them that will have dire consequences for the future.\nTwisters (2024)\nThe new Superman, David Corenswet, has a small role in Twisters, which may be significant years down the line. But he\u2019s not the prime attraction here, and neither are Daisy Edgar-Jones or Glen Powell, the two topline stars who have top billing. Instead, it\u2019s the tornadoes themselves that are the stars of Twisters, especially when the film veers into cartoonish levels of destruction.\nYears ago, storm chaser Kate Carter (Edgar-Jones) had a radical idea that tornadoes could be potentially weakened through her experimental method. When the experiment fails, Kate and Javi (Anthony Ramos) are the only survivors from their team. In the present, Javi lures Kate out of retirement to retry her experiment. While back in the field, Kate encounters a YouTube storm chaser, Tyler Owens (Powell), whom she initially dislikes. When the chips are down and the winds are blowing, Kate will be glad to have Tyler on her side.\nThe Accountant (2016)\nThe Accountant 2 is coming very soon, so it\u2019s worth revisiting the original film ahead of time. Ben Affleck plays the unnamed title character in The Accountant, and he\u2019s the best criminal accountant that the underworld can buy. The Accountant\u2019s autism helps his mind crunch numbers and detect fraud inside criminal organizations. In other words, he can sniff out a rat who\u2019s stealing money from his fellow crooks.\nHis latest client is Living Robotics, after an internal client, Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick), uncovers startling irregularities in the company\u2019s records. Co-owner Rita Blackburn (Jean Smart) hired the Accountant to sort things out, but what he discovers is a deadly conspiracy that won\u2019t only target him. Dana will also become a target because she knows too much about the fraud.\nSmile 2 (2024)\nSmile 2 is an unusual sequel in that the events of the first film aren\u2019t really necessary to understand what\u2019s happening in this one. Skye Riley (Naomi Scott) has no idea who Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) is or what happened to her in Smile, and the person who unintentionally connects them is a police officer named Joel (Kyle Gallner). Before long, Skye finds herself plagued by the same curse that afflicted Rose and Joel, and she doesn\u2019t know what to make of all of the creepy smiles she sees on everyone\u2019s faces.\nSkye isn\u2019t just some random woman; she\u2019s a pop star on the verge of even greater stardom. But the curse has a way of getting under its victims\u2019 skin and driving them insane. Skye is no exception, and as the curse stalks her wherever she goes, she rapidly loses the ability to tell what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t.\nPicture This (2025)\nBridgerton\u2018s Simone Ashley leads the cast of Picture This as Pia, a young woman struggling to keep her photography business afloat as her family prepares for the month-long build-up to the wedding of her younger sister, Sonal (Anoushka Chadha).\nDuring one of the wedding events, a spiritual advisor tells Pia that she will find the love and career success that she has always wanted somewhere in the next five dates that she goes on. Pia doesn\u2019t necessarily believe in that prediction, but the thought of it hangs over her head with every romantic encounter that she has. She also has to deal with her ex-boyfriend, Charlie (Hero Fiennes Tiffin), who is part of the wedding party on the groom\u2019s side. Seeing Charlie again makes Pia reexamine their relationship, and it\u2019s hard not to wonder if the prediction about her love life was wrong.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie was such a massive hit both in theaters and on streaming that it\u2019s kind of redeemed everything that happened after the first Super Mario Bros. movie. Animation was clearly the way to go for this adaptation, as Mario (Chris Pratt), Luigi (Charlie Day), and Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) look like they stepped out of a Nintendo Switch and into a breathtaking video game world.\nThe story serves as an origin for the Mario brothers, as they accidentally find themselves transported to the Mushroom Kingdom just as it\u2019s under attack by Bowser (Jack Black) and his army of Koopa Troopas. When Luigi gets captured by Bowser, Mario has to discover his inner hero alongside Peach and Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) as they search for allies in their struggle.\nBlink Twice (2024)\nAlthough she doesn\u2019t have an on-screen role in Blink Twice, Zoe Kravitz made her directorial debut with this movie. Naomi Ackie headlines the cast as Frida, a young woman who scores an exclusive invitation from billionaire Slater King (Channing Tatum) to visit his private island alongside her best friend, Jess (Alia Shawkat).\nFrida and Jess are lavished with gifts and attention alongside the other female guests on the island. However, Frida notices that she\u2019s experiencing gaps in her memories. When Jess goes missing, Frida is the only one left who remembers her friend. There\u2019s something sinister going on, and this may not be Frida\u2019s first time on Slater\u2019s private island.\nIn the Land of Saints and Sinners (2023)\nLiam Neeson\u2019s action thrillers are kind of a dime a dozen, but In the Land of Saints and Sinners is one of his best. Neeson plays Finbar Murphy, a World War II veteran living in Ireland during \u201cthe Troubles\u201d in the \u201970s. To support himself, Finbar has started working for a crime boss, Robert McQue (Colm Meaney), as an assassin.\nFinbar also befriends a younger contract killer named Kevin (Game of Thrones\u2018 Jack Gleeson), but one of their mutual targets is the brother of Doireann McCann (Kerry Condon), a formidable woman who won\u2019t back down from her revenge. Doireann is determined to avenge her brother, no matter who she has to kill to do it.\nThe Fall Guy (2024)\nStunt man Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) is burned out on Hollywood in The Fall Guy. It\u2019s hard to blame him after witnessing the injuries he suffers early in this movie. Unfortunately, Colt ruined his relationship with Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt) while he was torching his bridges to the entertainment industry. Nearly two years later, Colt reenters Jody\u2019s life when she\u2019s gotten the chance to direct her own movie.\nJody isn\u2019t exactly happy to see her ex again, but she needs her help. Her star, Tom Ryder (Kraven the Hunter\u2018s Aaron Taylor-Johnson), has gone missing, and this is more than just an actor on an extended bender. Without Tom, there is no movie to be made, and Jody\u2019s career will be over before it starts. Thus, Colt is drawn into a bigger mystery as he tries to locate Tom and make amends with Jody.\nA Quiet Place: Day One (2024)\nTypically, alien invasion movies involve humanity putting up a fight. But in A Quiet Place: Day One, the battle is over before it even begins, as humans can\u2019t withstand an attack by sightless alien hunters. Sam (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) witnessed the carnage herself while on a day out with her cat in the city.\nSam quickly realizes that her survival hinges on her ability to be quiet. Another survivor, Eric (The Fantastic Four: First Steps\u2018 Joseph Quinn), might be the last friend she ever makes. Sam and Eric must stick together if they want to escape New York City and evade the hunters now roaming the Earth.\nThe Bikeriders (2024)\nThe Bikeriders is loosely based upon the experiences of author Danny Lyon, a character portrayed by Mike Faist in this adaptation. But the film is largely reworked into an original story that focuses on three characters: Kathy (Jodie Comer), her lover, Benny (Austin Butler), and the leader of the Vandals Motorcycle Club, Johnny (Tom Hardy).\nJohnny had high-minded ideals when he founded the club in the 1960s. Over the course of the next decade, Johnny and his friends are almost unrecognizable in what they\u2019re willing to do for the club. Despite Benny\u2019s love for Kathy, he keeps getting drawn back into Johnny\u2019s vision for the club, even when it may destroy him.\nKnives Out (2019)\nDaniel Craig sheds his James Bond persona like a separate skin in Knives Out. Craig steps into the role of Southern sleuth Benoit Blanc, a man whose accent is just shy of Foghorn Leghorn territory. However, the voice somehow works for this comedic murder mystery. Ana de Armas has a standout turn as Marta Cabrera, the loyal housekeeper of a wealthy author, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer).\nAfter Harlan dies, his spoiled extended family is stunned to discover that his entire fortune has been left to Marta. The family does not know that Harlan was murdered. Plus, Marta is horrified to discover that the evidence points back to her just as Blanc begins his investigation.\nAbigail (2024)\nScream\u2018s Melissa Barrera reunites with directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett for Abigail, a film that is very much unlike her previous genre movies. Barrera plays Joey, a military veteran who has hit hard times. That\u2019s why she agreed to work with Frank (Dan Stevens) and a group of other criminals to kidnap a young girl named Abigail (Alisha Weir).\nJoey tries to form a connection with Abigail to assure the young girl that she will remain safe before learning that the latter is the daughter of a dangerous crime lord, Kristof Lazaar (Matthew Goode). However, the greatest threat to the kidnappers is Abigail herself, because she\u2019s more than she appears to be. When Abigail strikes, it\u2019s lethal.\nMonkey Man (2024)\nDev Patel made his directorial debut with Monkey Man, a film in which he also stars as the main character. And despite the title, Patel\u2019s character doesn\u2019t actually transform into a monkey or even go by that name. The audience only knows him as Kid, a man who will do anything to get his revenge on Rana Singh (Sikandar Kher), the corrupt police chief who murdered his mother.\nKid does wear a monkey mask when he\u2019s in the ring for an underground fighting circuit. However, his real disguise is pretending to be an ordinary waiter at a high-end brothel so he can rise through the ranks and get close enough to assassinate Rana no matter what his vengeance costs him.\nTerrifier 2 (2022)\nArt the Clown (David Howard Thornton) is back for another round of terror in Terrifier 2. Some evil entity has resurrected Art yet again, and he goes on another rampage. A teenager named Sienna Shaw (Lauren LaVera) is haunted by dreams of Art and she\u2019s convinced that her late father knew how to stop the clown once and for all.\nArt must sense the same thing, since he kidnaps Sienna\u2019s brother, Jonathan (Elliott Fullam), and terrorizes their family. Now, Sienna has to save her brother, but first, she must live through her encounter with Art.\nChallengers (2024)\nYou may have to pay close attention to Challengers, because the story doesn\u2019t take place in chronological order. Zendaya stars as Tashi Duncan, a rising tennis star romantically drawn to two other players on the pro tour: Patrick Zweig (Josh O\u2019Connor) and Art Donaldson (Mike Faist).\nBoth young men want Tashi for themselves, but only one of them is willing to play dirty to get her. Even when one of them wins Tashi\u2019s heart, it doesn\u2019t end the romantic entanglement between this trio as their lives unfold and intersect over several years. Ultimately, the battle between these two men is going to come back to the place where it all began: on the tennis court.\nSnack Shack (2024)\nSnack Shack is a coming-of-age comedy set in 1991. A.J. Carter (Conor Sherry) and his friend, Moose Miller (Gabriel LaBelle), are 14-year-olds whose schemes to get money almost always backfire on them. At least until they hit upon the idea of running the local Snack Shack for the summer.\nTheir bond of friendship is tested when A.J. meets Brooke, his attractive new neighbor. Because Moose makes the first move on Brooke, this creates tension between him and A.J., who isn\u2019t willing to simply back off. As Brooke begins to reciprocate A.J.\u2019s feelings, his friendship and lucrative partnership with Moose may come crashing down.\nBob Marley: One Love (2024)\nBob Marley: One Love is a music biopic that takes place late in the life of reggae superstar Bob Marley (Kingsley Ben-Adir). After Bob and his wife, Rita Marley (The Marvels actress Lashana Lynch), narrowly survive an assassination attempt in his native Jamaica, it sends him into a creative tailspin that threatens to derail his dreams.\nBefore Bob can resume his message of peace, he has to face his own inner demons and work out his issues with Rita. Bob Marley didn\u2019t have a lot of time in this world, but the film shows that he made the most of what he had and left a lasting legacy of music behind.\nAmerican Fiction (2023)\nAmerican Fiction casts The Batman Part Two\u2019s Jeffrey Wright as Dr. Thelonious \u201cMonk\u201d Ellison, a college professor and a novelist whose books sell very poorly. Monk is also upset that another writer, Sinatra Golden (Issa Rae), has found massive success while seemingly pandering to Black stereotypes. So Monk writes his own novel as a satire of Golden\u2019s books before submitting it for publication.\nMuch to Monk\u2019s surprise and horror, his satire is embraced by the publisher and the general public. The satire of the piece goes unnoticed, as the book becomes so popular that it starts taking over Monk\u2019s life, even though he made sure that his real name wasn\u2019t listed as the author. But once the book is out and Hollywood comes knocking, it may be too late.\nThe Idea of You (2024)\nThe irony of the premise of The Idea of You is that the romantic entanglement of Sol\u00e8ne Marchand (Eileen\u2018s Anne Hathaway) with boy band lead singer Hayes Campbell (Nicholas Galitzine) would probably be more of a fantasy for Sol\u00e8ne\u2019s daughter, Izzy (Ella Rubin), than for Sol\u00e8ne herself. But one unplanned encounter between Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes soon leads to several others.\nThere is an age gap between Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes that does come up in the film, but the bigger issue between them is the celebrity gap. As long as Hayes is a world-famous musician, he and Sol\u00e8ne may never be able to enjoy a normal romance without being hounded by the press.\nRoad House (2024)\nIn this remake of the popular 1989 movie starring Patrick Swayze, Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Elwood Dalton as a former UFC fighter who has fallen on some hard times. Road House gives Elwood a chance for redemption when Frankie (Jessica Williams) recruits him to be the bouncer at her bar, which shares its name with the title of the film.\nElwood\u2019s fighting skills go a long way towards keeping order at The Road House, much to the anger of a local mobster, Ben Brandt (Billy Magnussen). Elwood took care of Brandt\u2019s regular goons with ease, but he\u2019ll have a much harder time handling Knox, an enforcer for Brandt who is played by an actual UFC fighter, Conor McGregor.\nThe Other Zoey (2023)\nThe Other Zoey is not a remake of the Sandra Bullock rom-com While You Were Sleeping. But romantic comedy fans may notice some similarities between the two. Josephine Langford stars as Zoey Miller, a high school student who is definitely not the girlfriend of soccer star Zach MacLaren (Drew Starkey), whose girlfriend is also named Zoey (Maggie Thurmon).\nWhen Zach suffers a head injury that gives him partial amnesia, he mistakes Zoey for his girlfriend, and his doctors warn her not to upset him with the truth. So Zoey carries on the deception and gets closer to Zach on a lavish vacation. At the same time, Zoey also feels attracted to Zach\u2019s cousin, Miles Maclaren (Archie Renaux), who shares many of her views about love and life. So, which guy does Zoey really want? You\u2019ll have to watch the film to find out."

      "text": "Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age is a legendary time in film history. Modern audiences consider it a period of unparalleled luxury, class, elegance, and talent and the birthplace of some of the best films ever, brought to life by a seemingly endless parade of charming and exceptional performers. These actors hold a privileged place in our collective subconscious, flawless stars forever frozen in amber, icons rising high above the clouds, untouched by time, legends in every sense of the word.\nIt\u2019s tricky how we treat these classic Hollywood performers; every aspect of their lives enthralls us. Their victories, their defeats, their smiles, their tears, their heartache, their joy. In our eyes, they can\u2019t do wrong; their mistakes become misunderstood actions, their struggles provoke sympathy rather than condemnation, and their lives transform into blueprints of achievement and success. However, the sword cuts both ways. Most disturbingly, their pain and suffering become a source of entertainment; the sheer amount of yearly biopics about Hollywood icons with tragic lives says a lot about the way we view this particular time in film history.\nStill, there\u2019s no denying that classic film actors are more than stars for modern audiences. LGBTQ+ viewers are especially inclined to relate to and appreciate figures from Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age, the Crawfords and Monroes and Newmans of film history. But why? Why do LGBTQ+ fans hold these figures to a higher standard? What compels them to celebrate these icons, and what\u2019s behind this devotion?\nLife as the other\nWe LGBTQ+ people know what it\u2019s like to be the \u201cother,\u201d the one on the outside looking in. Even when we can fit more easily in a traditionally heteronormative space, we know the feeling of distance, of foreignness that comes with living half a lie, half a life.\nSome of the LGBTQ+ community\u2019s most beloved icons \u2014 Judy Garland, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Marilyn Monroe, Katharine Hepburn, Vivien Leigh \u2014 were trailblazers in more ways than one. They walked lonely paths towards stardom, often dealing with multiple personal issues at once \u2014 from mental health struggles to sexist institutional behavior that pushed them over the edge. Their private lives were interesting at the time and remain so today, but it\u2019s their complexity of mind and character that make them so fascinating.\nWe know of the deeper issues lurking beneath a seemingly flawless surface, but we still can\u2019t help but be enthralled by such a striking veneer. It would be futile to deny these ladies remain appealing to members of the LGBTQ+ community because of their more obvious qualities; endless grace to go with unparalleled beauty and unbreakable composure. Think of Crawford, stoic and intact, walking to her doom during the final moments in Humoresque, Monroe singing Diamonds Are a Girl\u2019s Best Friends in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Davis returning home after her makeover in Now, Voyager, Leigh\u2019s perpetually arched eyebrow in just about everything she did, or Hepburn\u2019s larger than life persona, on and off-screen.\nAbove all, we love these women because of the injustice that surrounded their lives. Garland\u2019s manipulation at MGM and Louis B. Mayer\u2019s hands is especially and notoriously egregious, as is her Oscar loss for A Star Is Born, quite possibly the best female performance in film history. Davis and Crawford\u2019s treatment at the end of their careers, Monroe\u2019s exploitation at the hands of the Hollywood machine, and Leigh\u2019s isolated life while dealing with a misunderstood mental illness contribute to our shared sympathy towards them. We identify with their loneliness and sympathize with their struggles, knowing full well what it means to walk a path with no others around.\nClassic Hollywood stars also represent some of our first examples of what it means to be different, to stand out because of who we are, how we look, dress, and act. Iconic images like Marlene Dietrich wearing a tux in Morocco, Crawford\u2019s architectural hair and impossibly large shoulder pads, Davis\u2019 unconventional beauty \u2014 at least by Hollywood\u2019s sexist standards \u2013, and Stanwyck\u2019s timeless femme fatales contributed to our ideas of class, beauty, femininity, and pride.\nLife in the closet\nCloseted actors were common during Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age. We know of several who were indeed part of the community, although their coming-out stories aren\u2019t exactly pleasant. Icons like Montgomery Clift and Rock Hudson were heartthrobs during the Golden Age, famous for their roles as leading men opposite some of the most beautiful women of the time \u2014 curiously, both were close with Elizabeth Taylor, another beloved figure for the LGBTQ+ community. Clift\u2019s sexuality remains subject to debate, although Taylor famously declared he was gay during her speech at the 2000 GLAAD Awards, a claim Clift\u2019s brother supported.\nHowever, Hudson\u2019s homosexuality is well-documented, for better and worse. One of the most successful stars of the 1950s, Hudson became synonymous with manliness through his work in films like Giant and the many romantic comedies he made with Doris Day. Hudson\u2019s sexuality was well-known around Hollywood, although it was expertly hidden and masqueraded by his agent, the infamous Henry Wilson. Hudson\u2019s homosexuality became public after becoming one of the first prominent stars to contract AIDS in the 1980s; Hudson died in 1985 from an AIDS-related illness.\nThe charm and fantasy surrounding certain Hollywood actors make it easier to wonder about their sexualities. Although considered a gay icon for years, James Dean\u2019s ambiguous and seemingly experimental take on sexuality has transformed him into a queer legend, particularly in recent years. Randall Riese\u2019s book The Unabridged James Dean: His Life and Legacy from A to Z quotes the screen legend as saying he was not a homosexual but was \u201ccertainly not going through life with one hand tied behind (his) back.\u201d Nicholas Ray, director of Rebel Without a Cause, went on record to say Dean \u201cwas not straight, he was not gay, he was bisexual.\u201d\nDean\u2019s notorious audition for East of Eden opposite Paul Newman has launched a thousand fanfics, cementing his place as an LGBTQ+ icon \u2014 and carving a place of honor for Newman in the rainbow community. Other well-known figures of the time, including legendary film director George Cukor, silent star Ramon Novarro, and 1950s heartthrob Tab Hunter were also gay, with their sexualities playing varying degrees of importance in their legacies.\nSeveral female stars are also suspected to be part of the LGBTQ+ community, even if their sexualities remain ambiguous. Many authors have speculated that screen legend Greta Garbo was bisexual, with Barry Paris claiming in his 2002 book Garbo that she was \u201ctechnically bisexual, predominantly lesbian, and increasingly asexual.\u201d Katharine Hepburn, widely famous during her time for her masculine energy and behavior, is now believed by many to have been a lesbian. Columnist Liz Smith, the Grand Dame of Dish and a close friend of Hepburn\u2019s, attested in the 2017 documentary Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood that this was indeed the case. And Joan Crawford\u2019s queer identity has become increasingly prominent in recent years. The actress apparently had relationships with men and women alike, with many even claiming the beginning of the Divine Feud between her and Bette Davis came from Crawford\u2019s lingering attraction toward Davis.\nForever icons\nHollywood\u2019s queer icons will always have a place of honor in our community. Nostalgia will always make everything seem brighter, bigger, and inherently better. However, our respect and appreciation of these figures and their legacies go beyond simple admiration. History has seldom been kind to queer figures, a sad yet undeniable fact that remains true today. Thus, we find comfort in those we relate to, rooting for their success and suffering along with their pain.\nWe may not be able to change their stories or improve their situations, but we can keep their memories alive and introduce new generations to their work. Their legacies aren\u2019t always simple to explain; there will always be traumas and painful stories lurking under the bed, secrets, poor choices, and clumsy commentaries that might be difficult to understand, let alone justify; Mommie Dearests waiting to happen. Indeed, these figures aren\u2019t perfect, far from it, but that is part of their legacy. Queer figures do not owe perfection to anyone, and appreciation is not glorification. We can see their flaws and understand their mistakes while celebrating their complexity and recognizing their influence in our community.\nWhether they were actually part of the LGBTQ+ community or just allies whose support would later become invaluable, these icons spoke to us through their showmanship and cinematic language. Their private struggles and strength to continue and prevail against all odds, sometimes against entire institutions hellbent on stopping them from thriving, are inspiring, especially for a group of people living in a society that moves the goalpost every day.\nPerhaps that\u2019s why Judy Garland is the ultimate gay icon. Judy had a legion of gay followers, a closeted gay father, two potentially queer husbands, and a slew of gay friends. Judy\u2019s trademark song, Over the Rainbow, launched a thousand dreams and a movement that would eventually change the LGBTQ+ community forever. Judy represents everything a queer icon should be, not because of the tragedy of her life but because of the strength of her will, a powerful hunger to be seen and heard even when everyone around her tried to make her disappear. In the end, we really are friends of Dorothy, and proudly so."

      "text": "Disney+ continues to be a reliable crowd-pleaser for streaming some of the best movies available. Whether it\u2019s the brand\u2019s usual kid-friendly flicks to content for all ages, the platform has plenty of variety on hand. Fans have more than enough to keep them busy between the service\u2019s plethora of Star Wars content, Marvel Studios superhero blockbusters, and National Geographic\u2019s intriguing educational content.\nStill, audiences might struggle to settle on something for a movie night with that level of depth in front of them. Thankfully, this monthly updated guide takes some of the pressure off by focusing on some of the best movies on Disney+ right now.\nIf you want to expand your search, we\u2019ve also rounded up the best new movies to stream, the best shows on Disney+, the best family movies on Disney+, the best movies on Amazon Prime, and the best movies on Hulu.\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023)\nWhile MCU fans are still eagerly awaiting Spider-Man: Brand New Day, Miles Morales\u2019 Spider-Verse adventures are just as engaging. In Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, co-directors Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin Thompson take Miles (Shameik Moore) on even bolder multiverse exploits. The young hero teams up with Spider-Woman (Hailee Steinfeld) to confront the portal-hopping villain, the Spot (Jason Schwartzman). Across the Spider-Verse improves upon its already terrific predecessor, from animation to character development. Miles\u2019 coming-of-age journey gets even more meaningful revelations, but Steinfeld\u2019s Spider-Woman receives a welcome focus in this sequel. Having Oscar Isaac as Spider-Man 2099 gives the movie another compelling personality, too.\nThe Abyss (1989)\nDirector James Cameron (Avatar) was making a name for himself in the 1980s, and The Abyss was another worthy standout. The plot sees a group of Navy SEALS team up with an oil platform crew to recover a nuclear sub that mysteriously sank deep into the ocean. The group finds themselves in a race against time to reach it before Soviet vessels do, but they\u2019ll discover an even more mysterious and powerful presence 25,000 feet underwater.\nEven with movies like Cameron\u2019s Terminator and Aliens dominating \u201880s science fiction, The Abyss is also an incredibly riveting sci-fi thriller in its own right. Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and Michael Biehn bolster a story filled with a tense, claustrophobic atmosphere and plenty of intrigue.\nPets (2025)\nBryce Dallas Howard continues to flex her directorial muscles with Pets on Disney+. A documentary film, Howard gives audiences a look at a series of people and the heartwarming connections they maintain with the animals in their lives.\nFrom dogs and cats to goats and pigs, viewers will be kept thoroughly entertained through the movie\u2019s mix of interviews, stories, and viral videos. Pets will make a delightful watch for any animal lover. The documentary will tug at the heartstrings as much as it will leave the audience laughing as it explores these loving relationships.\nSolo: A Star Wars Story (2018)\nThough it bombed at the box office, Solo: A Star Wars Story was a solid space adventure on its own merits. The Ron Howard-directed movie tells the origin story of the iconic smuggler Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich). From barely getting by on the streets of Corellia with his friend Qi\u2019ra (Emilia Clarke) to joining a daring heist for a crime boss alongside Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), these early capers shape the scoundrel fans know in the Original Trilogy.\nSolo: A Star Wars Story managed a moderately positive reception thanks to its high-octane and heist-themed premise. It\u2019s also rounded out by an excellent supporting cast, including Woody Harrelson as Han\u2019s mentor and Donald Glover as the smooth-talking Lando Calrissian. The story\u2019s pacing is better suited to TV, but Solo remains a fun sci-fi adventure with flavors of the Western genre.\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (2017)\nFans can rewatch the Tom Holland\u2019s original trilogy on Disney+ while they wait for his next appearance, starting with director Jon Watts\u2019 Spider-Man: Homecoming. The hero\u2019s most recent live-action reboot sees high schooler Peter Parker juggling the increasing responsibilities of his Spider-Man persona under Tony Stark\u2019s (Robert Downey Jr.) mentorship.\nMeanwhile, disgruntled salvage company owner Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) turns to weapons trafficking after Stark\u2019s company takes over the city-wide cleanup in the aftermath of The Avengers. Spider-Man: Homecoming was well-received as an introduction to Holland\u2019s take on the hero, presenting a relatable young man forced to deal with larger-than-life problems. It also overcomes the usual MCU critiques of lackluster villains, with Keaton portraying a menacing and creative version of the Vulture.\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)\nPerhaps the most polarizing installment in the Indiana Jones franchise, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is now available on Disney+. Set nearly two decades after The Last Crusade, director Steven Spielberg\u2019s sequel sees Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in a race against the KGB led by agent Spalko (Cate Blanchett) for a mysterious ancient artifact.\nIndy must uncover the sinister conspiracy led by the Soviet agent with the help of his former lover Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and son Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf). Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull received mixed reactions from audiences. While the premise was far from novel, Crystal Skull\u2019s globetrotting sense of adventure made it a worthy excuse to see Ford don the iconic hat and whip again.\nCaptain America: The First Avenger (2011)\nWith Captain America: Brave New World in theaters spotlighting Sam Wilson\u2019s next-generation hero, following it with the original movie is fitting. Directed by Joe Johnston, Captain America: The First Avenger was the original story for Steve Rogers (Chris Evans). Originally a fragile but lion-hearted young man, Rogers takes the Super Serum to become Captain America and leads the fight against the Nazi and Hydra leader Red Skull (Hugo Weaving).\nCaptain America: The First Avenger may not be a standout MCU movie, especially compared to its direct sequel, but it\u2019s a triumphant introduction for Evans\u2019 beloved take on the hero. Even with the standard \u201csuperhero origin\u201d formula, it follows it with a simple effectiveness that gives fans plenty of action-packed entertainment.\nStar Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005)\nThe Star Wars prequel trilogy may have been a general missed opportunity, but the finale was the bright spot. Directed by George Lucas, Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith chronicles the waning days of the Clone Wars and sets the stage for the Galactic Empire.\nFollowing the master-apprentice duo of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), the young prodigy finds himself at a moral crossroads, with the fate of the galaxy hanging in the balance. Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith is packed with fast-paced action choreography and intense character drama. The trilogy closer does well to capture the operatic tone the sci-fi franchise is known for.\nThor: Ragnarok (2017)\nWhile Taika Waititi\u2019s latest MCU endeavor with Thor left much to be desired, Thor: Ragnarok is still a worthy watch. Also directed by Waititi, the plot sees the titular God of Thunder (Chris Hemsworth) forced to escape bondage on the alien planet Sakaar. Alongside the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor must make it in time to prevent the villainous Hela (Cate Blanchett) from ushering in Ragnarok.\nWhere 2022\u2019s Love and Thunder leaned far too hard on the campiness, Thor: Ragnarok was praised for striking the right balance of humor and larger-than-life action. Aside from Hemsworth\u2019s spirited performance as the hero, stylized visuals and Blanchett\u2019s electric presence make Ragnarok stand out even today.\nDeadpool & Wolverine (2024)\nThe MCU\u2019s multiverse saga has seen highs and lows, but Deadpool & Wolverine was a welcome addition. A sequel to the main Deadpool series and Fox\u2019s broader X-Men movies, Shawn Levy\u2019s feature sees Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) team up with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) for a timeline-hopping mission.\nAfter discovering the TVA plans to destroy Wade\u2019s universe, he convinces a jaded and reluctant Logan from another continuity to stop the organization. Deadpool & Wolverine revels in the fact that it gets away with its raunchiness, offering a refreshing change of pace from the usual MCU output. Reynolds and Jackman\u2019s chemistry is hysterical, perfect for the bombastic tone of the former\u2019s antihero.\nFrozen (2013)\nCo-directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, Frozen became a cultural sensation for Disney in 2013. Set in a fantasy world, the plot revolves around the princess of Arendelle, Anna (Kristen Bell), and her sister, Elsa (Idina Menzel). The latter is now isolated in the North Mountain and accidentally plunges the land into a perpetual winter.\nThis leads Anna and her companions Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), the reindeer Sven, and the snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) to find the estranged magical sister. Thanks to its winter-themed visuals and broad appeal, Frozen is lauded as the best Disney animation movie of the 2010s. Comedy, infectious music, and a lovable cast back up a resonating story fitting for the holiday season.\nAvatar (2009)\nFew can match director James Cameron\u2019s blockbuster-level influence on the film medium, and 2009\u2019s Avatar was the start of a juggernaut franchise. Set in a sci-fi world in the mid-22nd century, humans are aggressively colonizing the planet Pandora for its extremely valuable mineral resource. This colonization threatens the homes and lives of the native Na\u2019vi tribe.\nBut when former Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) empathizes with their plight, he joins Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and her fellow Na\u2019vi in the fight against the human mining operation. Avatar\u2019s core premise doesn\u2019t score points for originality. However, the story is elevated by masterful special effects and a cast of characters that the audience can invest in. Worthington and Saldana\u2019s characters are perfect points of view for this imaginative sci-fi universe.\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008)\nDirector Andrew Adamson returns to adapt the second book in C. S. Lewis\u2019 Chronicles of Narnia series, Prince Caspian. Set one year after the events of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund, (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) find themselves thrust back into the world of Narnia.\nThe siblings must help the eponymous Prince Caspian, whose life is on the line from the threat of his uncle King Miraz. Much like its predecessor, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian was praised for its stunning visual effects, bringing Lewis\u2019 high-fantasy world to life. The notably darker storyline is anchored by a strong performance from the young ensemble, with Liam Neeson\u2019s voice for Aslan serving as another welcome return.\nInside Out 2 (2024)\nFollowing up on an acclaimed predecessor is never easy, but Inside Out 2 lives up to expectations and beyond. Directed by Kelsey Mann, the movie takes place two years after 13-year-old Riley Anderson\u2019s (Kensington Tallman) move to San Francisco.\nThe returning cast of anthropomorphic emotions includes Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, and Lewis Black, but they\u2019re faced with new emotions trying to dominate Riley\u2019s mind. Inside Out 2 builds on what made the original so beloved with its emotional sensitivity and nuanced portrayal of a child\u2019s growing pains. Combined with vivid animation and a sense of humor, Inside Out 2 is relatable and entertaining for all audiences.\nWest Side Story (2021)\nWhile musicals aren\u2019t as prominent as they were decades ago, the West Side Story remake is a worthwhile watch for fans of the genre. Directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg, the movie is set in 1957 New York and retells the classic story of a fierce rivalry between two teenage gangs \u2014 the Jets and the Sharks.\nTensions rise when Tony (Ansel Elgort), a reformed Jets gangster, falls in love with Maria (Rachel Zegler), the sister of a Shark leader. Spielberg\u2019s remake of West Side Story received critical acclaim for the spectacle of its cinematography and engaging musical numbers. It proudly wears the musical genre\u2019s roots on its sleeve, and it\u2019s all backed by spirited performances from Elgort and Zegler.\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)\nBased on C. S. Lewis\u2019s classic books, the first film adaptation of The Chronicles of Narnia is a solid watch. Directed by Andrew Adamson, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe sees four children escaping the German Blitz in England into a world otherwise thought of as wild imagination.\nThe children stumble upon a wardrobe that transports them to a once-peaceful high-fantasy world now plagued by war due to the White Witch\u2019s eternal winter. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was critically well-received for being a visually stunning and narratively faithful adaptation. Liam Neeson\u2019s voice performance as the lion Aslan is a major highlight, but the overall story and impressive special effects make this a great movie for all audiences.\nInside Out (2015)\nConsidering the sequel\u2019s resounding success and recent arrival on Disney+, revisiting the first Inside Out would make for a great movie night. The story focuses on young Riley, an 11-year-old girl who is struggling to adapt to their family\u2019s big move to another city.\nHer anthropomorphic team of emotions tries to help manage this massive change, but things get complicated when Joy (Amy Poehler) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) get lost. Inside Out is easily one of Pixar\u2019s best movies of the 2010s, thanks to its creative premise, impressive voice cast, and colorful animation. Like its sequel, the story also handles its coming-of-age themes with emotional maturity.\nYoung Woman and the Sea (2024)\nThe sports drama Young Woman and the Sea was originally a Disney+ original movie until the company opted for a theatrical release following successful test screenings. Directed by Joachim R\u00f8nning (Kon-Tiki, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales), the story follows the journey of real-life competitive swimmer Gertrude \u201cTrudy\u201d Ederle.\nThe movie chronicles her life, from overcoming a near-fatal case of measles as a child to her rise as an Olympic athlete. Young Woman and the Sea received a strong critical reception for its inspirational retelling of Ederle\u2019s life. Bolstered by Daisy Ridley\u2019s lively lead performance, Young Woman and the Sea is a must-watch for fans of biographical sports dramas.\nX-Men: First Class (2011)\nFor audiences wanting more mutant action after Deadpool & Wolverine, X-Men: First Class is essential. Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass, Kingsman: The Secret Service), this origin story mainly follows the growing bond and eventual rift between Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender).\nWhile Xavier and Magneto\u2019s recruited mutants gradually take sides, Hellfire Club leader Sebastian Shaw is dead set on sparking nuclear war amid the Cuban Missile Crisis. X-Men: First Class remains one of the best live-action portrayals of the mutant team thanks to its terrific ensemble cast. It juggles its characters well, and using the 1960s as a backdrop makes First Class an excellent superhero-themed period piece.\nX-Men: Days of Future Past (2014)\nMatching First Class was no easy task, but X-Men: Days of Future Past achieved that and more. Directed by Bryan Singer (X-Men, Bohemian Rhapsody), this sequel sees Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) travel back to 1973 to prevent a global catastrophe.\nJoining the past versions of the heroes from First Class with the classic iterations from the 2000s movies, the team fights to prevent a dystopic future where robot Sentinels slaughter humans and mutants alike. X-Men: Days of Future Past received strong reviews for its striking visuals, exciting action sequences, and the increased scope of its story. It raised its stakes to postapocalyptic levels without feeling derivative and did justice to Chris Claremont and John Byrne\u2019s acclaimed comic book arc of the same name.\nThe Princess Bride (1987)\nThe Princess Bride is a 1980s classic that\u2019s aged incredibly well. Directed by Rob Reiner and adapted from William Goldman\u2019s 1973 novel, it tells the tale of the farmhand Westley (Cary Elwes) and Buttercup (Robin Wright) \u2014 the titular bride \u2014 who fall in love and go to great lengths to reunite.\nWestley and his group of adventurers must rescue her from her arranged marriage to the evil Prince Humperdinck. The Princess Bride is a timeless, acclaimed movie that has the perfect mix of fantasy, romance, comedy, action and adventure. Despite its seemingly simple premise, it\u2019s a story that can appeal to anybody and gives the otherwise tired \u201cdamsel-in-distress\u201d trope a colorful spin.\nFantastic Mr. Fox (2009)\nDirector Wes Anderson is known for his unique visual style and eccentric storytelling, and his 2009 adaptation of Roald Dahl\u2019s Fantastic Mr. Fox is no exception. The plot revolves around the adventures of a fox (Wolfs\u2018 George Clooney) working as a newspaper columnist tempted by his past as a thief.\nAfter a string of heists on a group of farmers goes wrong, Mr. Fox, his family, and his community find themselves hunted. Fantastic Mr. Fox earned critical acclaim partly for its impressive stop-motion animation and art direction. The story was similarly praised for using the animation medium and anthropomorphic cast to convey themes of class struggles and societal norms.\nJim Henson Idea Man (2024)\nJim Henson was one of the most influential puppeteers for creating now-iconic franchises like The Muppets, Sesame Street, and The Dark Crystal. Directed by Ron Howard, Jim Henson Idea Man recounts the creator\u2019s early career years, developing those beloved properties, and his relationship with his wife and Muppets, Inc. co-founder Jane Henson.\nJim Henson Idea Man received positive reviews for its affectionate overview of Henson\u2019s professional and personal life. One part documentary and one part tribute movie, Idea Man shows how Henson\u2019s drive made him a pioneer in this art form.\nBig (1988)\nTom Hanks is one of the most celebrated actors in film history, with Big regarded as one of his breakout hits. Directed by Penny Marshall, it tells the story of a boy named Josh Baskin (David Moscow) who makes a wish at a carnival machine to be \u201cbig.\u201d\nThe next morning, Josh discovers that he\u2019s aged into an adult body (Tom Hanks) but retained his 13-year-old mind. Big earned widespread acclaim as one of the best comedies of the 1980s. Thanks to its charming premise and Hanks\u2019 hilarious and lively performance, it holds up well today as a comedy classic.\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean movies are still the studio\u2019s most lucrative attempts at adapting iconic Disney park rides. Directed by Gore Verbinski, The Curse of the Black Pearl sees eccentric 18th-century pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) set off to rescue Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the daughter of Port Royal\u2019s governor.\nCaptain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his crew aboard the Black Pearl kidnap her as they attempt to undo a curse placed on them after stealing an Aztec treasure. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl stands as the series\u2019 best, taking advantage of the novelty behind building an engaging story around a theme park ride. The movie was well-received for its swashbuckling tone and spirited performances by the main cast.\nThe Amazing Spider-Man (2012)\nThough Sony\u2019s post-Sam Raimi reboot didn\u2019t pan out as hoped, Marc Webb\u2019s first take in The Amazing Spider-Man was a promising start. Led by Andrew Garfield as the titular hero, it follows Peter Parker\u2019s struggles to balance his new dual life while attempting to uncover a conspiracy surrounding his parents\u2019 disappearances,. This leads to a violent clash against Dr. Curt Connors\u2019 (Rhys Ifans) beastly persona the Lizard. Peter\u2019s love interest Gwen Stacy (Poor Things\u2018 Emma Stone) also gets caught in the crossfire.\nThe Amazing Spider-Man features a passionate performance by Garfield, as he carries a convincing coming-of-age story amid the action. Similarly, Stone\u2019s casting as Gwen Stacy is pitch-perfect. She\u2019s convincing character on her own merits while maintaining an electric chemistry with Garfield\u2019s Peter.\nToy Story 2 (1999)\nEven with the first Toy Story\u2018s acclaim, the sequel more than lived up to its expectations. Directed by John Lasseter, the movie follows Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the rest of the original crew\u2019s attempt to rescue Woody (Tom Hanks) from an obsessive toy collector.\nHowever, things get complicated when Woody considers staying in the collector\u2019s glorified museum with his new friend Jessie (Joan Cusack). Toy Story 2 accomplishes the rare feat of surpassing its iconic predecessor. It continues the winning formula of exploring original cast\u2019s relationships while introducing endearing new characters. Cusack\u2019s Jessie is a particular highlight, as she seamlessly cements her place as one of the franchise\u2019s most beloved characters.\nThe Space Race (2023)\nCo-directed by Diego Hurtado de Mendoza and Lisa Cort\u00e9s, The Space Race is a standout documentary film from National Geographic. The movie tells the story of the first Black astronauts who broke through racial barriers during the early days of the Civil Rights movement to become key figures within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, including Guion Bluford, Ed Dwight, and Charles Bolden.\nIt\u2019s an enlightening and fascinating watch that revisits this story through a combination of decades\u2019 worth of film archives and interview materials. The Space Race is a compelling documentary movie that covers a lesser-known aspect of American history.\nX2 (2003)\nThe early 2000s continued to be kind to one of Marvel Comics\u2019 most iconic superhero teams with X2: X-Men United. Bryan Singer returned to the director\u2019s chair for this sequel, telling a thrilling story that forces Professor Charles Xavier\u2019s gifted students to team up with Magneto\u2019s Brotherhood of Mutants to put an end to Colonel William Stryker\u2019s genocidal plans.\nThe villain leads an onslaught on Xavier and his school of mutants in an attempt to reprogram the Professor\u2019s tracking computer, Cerebro, to assassinate every known mutant on the planet systematically. As with the first movie in this series, X2: X-Men United was critically praised for balancing a well-rounded ensemble cast bolstered by commendable performances. Its engaging plot and impressive action set pieces further complemented what was one of the best superhero sequels of that decade.\nX-Men (2000)\nWhile fans are still waiting on the X-Men to make their proper MCU debut, the original 2000 live-action movie is still an entertaining watch. X-Men details how several of the iconic Marvel mutants joined Professor Charles Xavier (Star Trek: The Next Generation\u2018s Patrick Stewart) and his titular team while focusing particularly on Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin).\nXavier and his mutant allies find themselves in the middle of a violent conflict with the more extreme Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Magneto (played by Ian McKellen). Director Bryan Singer\u2019s X-Men is a nostalgic watch in the modern age, filled with action and a packed ensemble cast. It contains just the right amount of early 2000s campiness to be an engaging story even today.\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023)\nThe beloved Harrison Ford closes out his tenure as the adventurous archeologist in director James Mangold\u2019s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. In this final outing, Indy and his estranged goddaughter Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) team up in a race against time to find a dangerous ancient artifact.\nNazi scientist J\u00fcrgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) intends to uncover this mysterious tool to change the outcome of World War II. Though the movie had a comparatively lukewarm reception when looking at more celebrated features like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Dial of Destiny still shows why Ford succeeded in making the swashbuckling action hero a household name.\nDeadpool (2016)\nA spinoff X-Men movie from the Fox era of the franchise, director Tim Miller\u2019s Deadpool was a surprise hit for the superhero genre. Led by the funny and charismatic Ryan Reynolds as the titular antihero, the movie follows the tragic origins of Wade Wilson and his relentless hunt for the man who ruined his life.\nAs tragic as his origins are, Deadpool seamlessly weaves in the character\u2019s signature raunchy comedic edge from the comic book source material. The movie\u2019s success further popularized the idea of R-rated superhero productions, with Reynolds\u2019 casting proving to be a match made in heaven.\nDeadpool 2 (2018)\nDirector David Leitch takes the reins for Deadpool 2, which sees the beloved Merc With a Mouth take on a wider array of threats from the X-Men universe. Wade forces the X-Force superhero team to help save a young mutant boy from a ruthless time-traveling soldier named Cable (Josh Brolin).\nOverall, Deadpool 2 doubles down on the action and comedic elements that made the original such a hit, and it largely pays off. Reynolds\u2019 performance as the foul-mouthed mercenary with a heart of gold is as charismatic as fans would hope, and his chemistry with Brolin\u2019s Cable is effortlessly entertaining.\nLogan (2017)\nPerhaps one of the best superhero movies in general, director James Mangold brought to screen Wolverine\u2019s best theatrical outing in Logan. Set in an alternate canon separate from the mainline X-Men movies, this gritty tale sees a punished and battered Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) in a post-apocalyptic countryside where mutants are vehemently persecuted, killed, and experimented on for nefarious purposes.\nAlong the way, the aged pair ends up defending a young mutant girl named Laura from the mutant-hunting Reavers. A masterful blend of the superhero, neo-noir, and Western film genres and bolstered by Oscar-worthy performances from Jackman and Stewart, Logan is one of the most impactful comic book movies since The Dark Knight.\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)\nAfter an extended delay, James Gunn finally came back to put his finishing touch on the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy with Vol. 3. Set after the events of Avengers: Infinite War and Endgame, Quill and the rest of the misfit superhero crew are still dealing with the death of their timeline\u2019s Gamora.\nNow joined by an alternate version of Gamora introduced in Endgame, the Guardians take off on a mission to rescue Rocket Raccoon from the High Evolutionary (played by Chukwudi Iwuji), an alien cyborg scientist who seeks to create his twisted idea of a perfect society. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 has been praised for its relentlessly emotional approach and sendoff for this beloved team of underdog superheroes.\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)\nGuardians of the Galaxy (2014)\nAvatar: The Way of Water (2022)\nRaiders of the Lost Ark (1981)\nIn preparation for Harrison Ford\u2019s last hurrah as Indiana Jones, Disney+ is adding the series\u2019 beloved classics. Directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg, Raiders of the Lost Ark marks the debut of the fan-favorite adventurer trying to stop Nazi forces from securing a dangerous treasure.\nThe movie was revolutionary for its time, pushing the boundaries for action set pieces and the evolution of the pulpy adventure genre. Indiana Jones is still an iconic character, with the swashbuckling archeologist\u2019s first theatrical outing holding up well even today.\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)\nDirector Steven Spielberg followed up on the blockbuster hit that was Raiders with the solid Temple of Doom. The plot follows Harrison Ford\u2019s treasure-hunting adventurer arriving in India to retrieve a mystical stone and stop a bloodthirsty cult. The local villagers are desperate for Indy\u2019s help, as the Thugee cult indulges in ritual sacrifices, sacrifices, and blood magic.\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was well-received for its intense new story and darker approach, though, it was more controversial in the \u201980s for its comparatively bleak atmosphere to Raiders.\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)\nOnce again helmed by Spielberg, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was a strong finish to the original three movies. While Temple of Doom was technically a prequel to Raiders, Last Crusade moves the timeline forward as Indy travels around the world to rescue his missing father Henry Jones (played by Sean Connery).\nJones Sr. went missing on a hunt for the Holy Grail and was held hostage by Nazis. Temple of Doom retroactively received the positive reception it deserved, but Last Crusade does well to reintegrate the lighter, swashbuckling atmosphere of the first movie.\nAvengers: Endgame (2019)\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe built itself into a wildly lucrative property since 2008\u2019s Iron Man. 11 years later, Avengers: Endgame was released to become a pop-culture phenomenon and the crossover event of the decade.\nReeling from the catastrophic events of Infinity War, the Avengers gather who remains to lead a final assault on the galactic conqueror Thanos. The Russo brothers managed to make Endgame a satisfying payoff to 11 years\u2019 worth of mythos and cap off the Infinity Saga.\nAvengers: Infinity War (2018)\nOne of the biggest comic book movie events in recent years, Marvel Studios\u2019 Avengers: Infinity War is a jam-packed crossover event. The first in a two-part story with the sequel Endgame, Infinity War finally sees the cosmic threat Thanos \u2014 played menacingly by Josh Brolin \u2014 take his universe-wide fight to Earth and its mightiest heroes.\nIt delivers a long-awaited series of clashes and interactions between various heroes and villains, and is a major bright spot in the MCU\u2019s catalog. Infinity War is constantly tense with action and revelations, setting the stage for this universe\u2019s biggest narrative payoff.\nCaptain America: Civil War (2016)\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)\nSince the tragic passing of actor Chadwick Boseman, the sequel to Black Panther was always going to have a somber atmosphere about it. However, Ryan Coogler\u2019s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever succeeds in being a tasteful and touching tribute that advanced the story from this corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nIn the wake of King T\u2019Challa\u2019s death, the leaders of the nation need to rally together as Namor \u2014 the king of an ancient underwater civilization \u2014 leads an assault on Wakanda. Angela Bassett, in particular, leads the film with a commanding performance.\nReturn of the Jedi (1983)\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)\nStar Wars (1977)\nForty -five years ago this week, the original Star Wars hit theaters and changed the movies forever. It was subsequently given the \u201cEpisode 4: A New Hope\u201d name, but to the first generation of fans, it all starts here. In a desperate bid to keep Darth Vader (David Prowse with James Earl Jones as Vader\u2019s voice) from retrieving the plans for a super weapon called the Death Star, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) hides them with two droids. From there, destiny awaits a restless young man named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), an exiled Jedi called Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), the Wookie Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and the scoundrel known as Han Solo (Harrison Ford). Even after all of these years, it\u2019s still a rousing space adventure."

That\u2019s not a spoiler for the movie, because Claressa\u2019s Olympic triumph isn\u2019t the ultimate destination, it\u2019s just a stop along the way.

Emily\u2019s ex-husband, Sean Townsend (Henry Golding), and her mother, Margaret McLanden (Elizabeth Perkins), also made the trip. Regardless, Stephanie is expecting a double cross from Emily.

Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes), the dean of the College of Cardinals, will oversee the election of the next pope. And it\u2019s more than just a choice between the four major candidates. Whoever is chosen will shape the future of the Catholic Church itself.\nThe election may take place behind closed doors in Vatican City, but the secrets that emerge could end the careers of some and potentially spark more scandal in the church.

Russell Crowe\u2019s character remains dead, but Lucius Verus Aurelius (Paul Mescal) carries on the tradition of losing his family and being sold into slavery in Gladiator II.

President Sutton manages to get free. And if she wants to save her family and her fellow leaders, then she\u2019ll need to get her hands dirty and do it herself.\nVal (2021)\nEven years before Val Kilmer became a star in Hollywood, he kept home movies from his childhood to his teens and beyond.

Since Kilmer had lost his voice during his battle with throat cancer, Jack Kilmer stepped in to read the words written by his father as he looked back at everything he went through to become the man he wanted to be.\nHolland (2025)\nWhat\u2019s eating Nancy Vandergroot (Nicole Kidman) in Holland? She\u2019s got a great thing going in this small town with overtly Dutch roots. Nancy\u2019s got a fine husband, Fred Vandergroot (Matthew Macfadyen), and their son, Harry (Jude Hill), is unusually well-behaved.\nIt\u2019s so perfect that the slightest imperfection alerts Nancy that maybe things aren\u2019t so rosy after all. For an optometrist, Fred sure takes a lot of out-of-town trips. Nancy\u2019s pretty sure that means Fred\u2019s having an affair, and she turns to her new friend, Dave Delgado (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal), to help her prove it. What they find isn\u2019t what Nancy expected, which turns her world upside down.\nTransformers One (2024)\nTransformers One is the origin story of the franchise\u2019s leading hero and villain: Optimus Prime and Megatron. At this point in their history, Optimus is known as Orion Pax (Chris Hemsworth), while the future Megatron is D-16 (Brian Tyree Henry). Both are miners on Cybertron, and good friends as well.\nAfter befriending B-127 (Keegan-Michael Key) and their former boss, Elita-1 (Scarlett Johansson), Orion and D-16 discover that Cybertron\u2019s ruler, Sentinal Prime (Jon Hamm), has betrayed the planet to their enemies. Orion and D-16 are both outraged by this revelation, but they aren\u2019t on the same page about how to handle it. That leads to the beginning of a rift between them that will have dire consequences for the future.\nTwisters (2024)\nThe new Superman, David Corenswet, has a small role in Twisters, which may be significant years down the line. But he\u2019s not the prime attraction here, and neither are Daisy Edgar-Jones or Glen Powell, the two topline stars who have top billing. Instead, it\u2019s the tornadoes themselves that are the stars of Twisters, especially when the film veers into cartoonish levels of destruction.\nYears ago, storm chaser Kate Carter (Edgar-Jones) had a radical idea that tornadoes could be potentially weakened through her experimental method. When the experiment fails, Kate and Javi (Anthony Ramos) are the only survivors from their team. In the present, Javi lures Kate out of retirement to retry her experiment. While back in the field, Kate encounters a YouTube storm chaser, Tyler Owens (Powell), whom she initially dislikes. When the chips are down and the winds are blowing, Kate will be glad to have Tyler on her side.\nThe Accountant (2016)\nThe Accountant 2 is coming very soon, so it\u2019s worth revisiting the original film ahead of time. Ben Affleck plays the unnamed title character in The Accountant, and he\u2019s the best criminal accountant that the underworld can buy. The Accountant\u2019s autism helps his mind crunch numbers and detect fraud inside criminal organizations. In other words, he can sniff out a rat who\u2019s stealing money from his fellow crooks.\nHis latest client is Living Robotics, after an internal client, Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick), uncovers startling irregularities in the company\u2019s records. Co-owner Rita Blackburn (Jean Smart) hired the Accountant to sort things out, but what he discovers is a deadly conspiracy that won\u2019t only target him. Dana will also become a target because she knows too much about the fraud.\nSmile 2 (2024)\nSmile 2 is an unusual sequel in that the events of the first film aren\u2019t really necessary to understand what\u2019s happening in this one. Skye Riley (Naomi Scott) has no idea who Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) is or what happened to her in Smile, and the person who unintentionally connects them is a police officer named Joel (Kyle Gallner). Before long, Skye finds herself plagued by the same curse that afflicted Rose and Joel, and she doesn\u2019t know what to make of all of the creepy smiles she sees on everyone\u2019s faces.\nSkye isn\u2019t just some random woman; she\u2019s a pop star on the verge of even greater stardom. But the curse has a way of getting under its victims\u2019 skin and driving them insane. Skye is no exception, and as the curse stalks her wherever she goes, she rapidly loses the ability to tell what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t.\nPicture This (2025)\nBridgerton\u2018s Simone Ashley leads the cast of Picture This as Pia, a young woman struggling to keep her photography business afloat as her family prepares for the month-long build-up to the wedding of her younger sister, Sonal (Anoushka Chadha).\nDuring one of the wedding events, a spiritual advisor tells Pia that she will find the love and career success that she has always wanted somewhere in the next five dates that she goes on. Pia doesn\u2019t necessarily believe in that prediction, but the thought of it hangs over her head with every romantic encounter that she has. She also has to deal with her ex-boyfriend, Charlie (Hero Fiennes Tiffin), who is part of the wedding party on the groom\u2019s side. Seeing Charlie again makes Pia reexamine their relationship, and it\u2019s hard not to wonder if the prediction about her love life was wrong.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie was such a massive hit both in theaters and on streaming that it\u2019s kind of redeemed everything that happened after the first Super Mario Bros. movie. Animation was clearly the way to go for this adaptation, as Mario (Chris Pratt), Luigi (Charlie Day), and Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) look like they stepped out of a Nintendo Switch and into a breathtaking video game world.\nThe story serves as an origin for the Mario brothers, as they accidentally find themselves transported to the Mushroom Kingdom just as it\u2019s under attack by Bowser (Jack Black) and his army of Koopa Troopas. When Luigi gets captured by Bowser, Mario has to discover his inner hero alongside Peach and Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) as they search for allies in their struggle.\nBlink Twice (2024)\nAlthough she doesn\u2019t have an on-screen role in Blink Twice, Zoe Kravitz made her directorial debut with this movie. Naomi Ackie headlines the cast as Frida, a young woman who scores an exclusive invitation from billionaire Slater King (Channing Tatum) to visit his private island alongside her best friend, Jess (Alia Shawkat).\nFrida and Jess are lavished with gifts and attention alongside the other female guests on the island. However, Frida notices that she\u2019s experiencing gaps in her memories. When Jess goes missing, Frida is the only one left who remembers her friend. There\u2019s something sinister going on, and this may not be Frida\u2019s first time on Slater\u2019s private island.\nIn the Land of Saints and Sinners (2023)\nLiam Neeson\u2019s action thrillers are kind of a dime a dozen, but In the Land of Saints and Sinners is one of his best. Neeson plays Finbar Murphy, a World War II veteran living in Ireland during \u201cthe Troubles\u201d in the \u201970s. To support himself, Finbar has started working for a crime boss, Robert McQue (Colm Meaney), as an assassin.\nFinbar also befriends a younger contract killer named Kevin (Game of Thrones\u2018 Jack Gleeson), but one of their mutual targets is the brother of Doireann McCann (Kerry Condon), a formidable woman who won\u2019t back down from her revenge. Doireann is determined to avenge her brother, no matter who she has to kill to do it.\nThe Fall Guy (2024)\nStunt man Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) is burned out on Hollywood in The Fall Guy. It\u2019s hard to blame him after witnessing the injuries he suffers early in this movie. Unfortunately, Colt ruined his relationship with Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt) while he was torching his bridges to the entertainment industry. Nearly two years later, Colt reenters Jody\u2019s life when she\u2019s gotten the chance to direct her own movie.\nJody isn\u2019t exactly happy to see her ex again, but she needs her help. Her star, Tom Ryder (Kraven the Hunter\u2018s Aaron Taylor-Johnson), has gone missing, and this is more than just an actor on an extended bender. Without Tom, there is no movie to be made, and Jody\u2019s career will be over before it starts. Thus, Colt is drawn into a bigger mystery as he tries to locate Tom and make amends with Jody.\nA Quiet Place: Day One (2024)\nTypically, alien invasion movies involve humanity putting up a fight. But in A Quiet Place: Day One, the battle is over before it even begins, as humans can\u2019t withstand an attack by sightless alien hunters. Sam (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) witnessed the carnage herself while on a day out with her cat in the city.\nSam quickly realizes that her survival hinges on her ability to be quiet. Another survivor, Eric (The Fantastic Four: First Steps\u2018 Joseph Quinn), might be the last friend she ever makes. Sam and Eric must stick together if they want to escape New York City and evade the hunters now roaming the Earth.\nThe Bikeriders (2024)\nThe Bikeriders is loosely based upon the experiences of author Danny Lyon, a character portrayed by Mike Faist in this adaptation. But the film is largely reworked into an original story that focuses on three characters: Kathy (Jodie Comer), her lover, Benny (Austin Butler), and the leader of the Vandals Motorcycle Club, Johnny (Tom Hardy).\nJohnny had high-minded ideals when he founded the club in the 1960s. Over the course of the next decade, Johnny and his friends are almost unrecognizable in what they\u2019re willing to do for the club. Despite Benny\u2019s love for Kathy, he keeps getting drawn back into Johnny\u2019s vision for the club, even when it may destroy him.\nKnives Out (2019)\nDaniel Craig sheds his James Bond persona like a separate skin in Knives Out. Craig steps into the role of Southern sleuth Benoit Blanc, a man whose accent is just shy of Foghorn Leghorn territory. However, the voice somehow works for this comedic murder mystery. Ana de Armas has a standout turn as Marta Cabrera, the loyal housekeeper of a wealthy author, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer).\nAfter Harlan dies, his spoiled extended family is stunned to discover that his entire fortune has been left to Marta. The family does not know that Harlan was murdered. Plus, Marta is horrified to discover that the evidence points back to her just as Blanc begins his investigation.\nAbigail (2024)\nScream\u2018s Melissa Barrera reunites with directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett for Abigail, a film that is very much unlike her previous genre movies. Barrera plays Joey, a military veteran who has hit hard times. That\u2019s why she agreed to work with Frank (Dan Stevens) and a group of other criminals to kidnap a young girl named Abigail (Alisha Weir).\nJoey tries to form a connection with Abigail to assure the young girl that she will remain safe before learning that the latter is the daughter of a dangerous crime lord, Kristof Lazaar (Matthew Goode). However, the greatest threat to the kidnappers is Abigail herself, because she\u2019s more than she appears to be. When Abigail strikes, it\u2019s lethal.\nMonkey Man (2024)\nDev Patel made his directorial debut with Monkey Man, a film in which he also stars as the main character. And despite the title, Patel\u2019s character doesn\u2019t actually transform into a monkey or even go by that name. The audience only knows him as Kid, a man who will do anything to get his revenge on Rana Singh (Sikandar Kher), the corrupt police chief who murdered his mother.\nKid does wear a monkey mask when he\u2019s in the ring for an underground fighting circuit. However, his real disguise is pretending to be an ordinary waiter at a high-end brothel so he can rise through the ranks and get close enough to assassinate Rana no matter what his vengeance costs him.\nTerrifier 2 (2022)\nArt the Clown (David Howard Thornton) is back for another round of terror in Terrifier 2. Some evil entity has resurrected Art yet again, and he goes on another rampage. A teenager named Sienna Shaw (Lauren LaVera) is haunted by dreams of Art and she\u2019s convinced that her late father knew how to stop the clown once and for all.\nArt must sense the same thing, since he kidnaps Sienna\u2019s brother, Jonathan (Elliott Fullam), and terrorizes their family. Now, Sienna has to save her brother, but first, she must live through her encounter with Art.\nChallengers (2024)\nYou may have to pay close attention to Challengers, because the story doesn\u2019t take place in chronological order. Zendaya stars as Tashi Duncan, a rising tennis star romantically drawn to two other players on the pro tour: Patrick Zweig (Josh O\u2019Connor) and Art Donaldson (Mike Faist).\nBoth young men want Tashi for themselves, but only one of them is willing to play dirty to get her. Even when one of them wins Tashi\u2019s heart, it doesn\u2019t end the romantic entanglement between this trio as their lives unfold and intersect over several years. Ultimately, the battle between these two men is going to come back to the place where it all began: on the tennis court.\nSnack Shack (2024)\nSnack Shack is a coming-of-age comedy set in 1991. A.J. Carter (Conor Sherry) and his friend, Moose Miller (Gabriel LaBelle), are 14-year-olds whose schemes to get money almost always backfire on them. At least until they hit upon the idea of running the local Snack Shack for the summer.\nTheir bond of friendship is tested when A.J. meets Brooke, his attractive new neighbor. Because Moose makes the first move on Brooke, this creates tension between him and A.J., who isn\u2019t willing to simply back off. As Brooke begins to reciprocate A.J.\u2019s feelings, his friendship and lucrative partnership with Moose may come crashing down.\nBob Marley: One Love (2024)\nBob Marley: One Love is a music biopic that takes place late in the life of reggae superstar Bob Marley (Kingsley Ben-Adir). After Bob and his wife, Rita Marley (The Marvels actress Lashana Lynch), narrowly survive an assassination attempt in his native Jamaica, it sends him into a creative tailspin that threatens to derail his dreams.\nBefore Bob can resume his message of peace, he has to face his own inner demons and work out his issues with Rita. Bob Marley didn\u2019t have a lot of time in this world, but the film shows that he made the most of what he had and left a lasting legacy of music behind.\nAmerican Fiction (2023)\nAmerican Fiction casts The Batman Part Two\u2019s Jeffrey Wright as Dr. Thelonious \u201cMonk\u201d Ellison, a college professor and a novelist whose books sell very poorly. Monk is also upset that another writer, Sinatra Golden (Issa Rae), has found massive success while seemingly pandering to Black stereotypes. So Monk writes his own novel as a satire of Golden\u2019s books before submitting it for publication.\nMuch to Monk\u2019s surprise and horror, his satire is embraced by the publisher and the general public. The satire of the piece goes unnoticed, as the book becomes so popular that it starts taking over Monk\u2019s life, even though he made sure that his real name wasn\u2019t listed as the author. But once the book is out and Hollywood comes knocking, it may be too late.\nThe Idea of You (2024)\nThe irony of the premise of The Idea of You is that the romantic entanglement of Sol\u00e8ne Marchand (Eileen\u2018s Anne Hathaway) with boy band lead singer Hayes Campbell (Nicholas Galitzine) would probably be more of a fantasy for Sol\u00e8ne\u2019s daughter, Izzy (Ella Rubin), than for Sol\u00e8ne herself. But one unplanned encounter between Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes soon leads to several others.\nThere is an age gap between Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes that does come up in the film, but the bigger issue between them is the celebrity gap. As long as Hayes is a world-famous musician, he and Sol\u00e8ne may never be able to enjoy a normal romance without being hounded by the press.\nRoad House (2024)\nIn this remake of the popular 1989 movie starring Patrick Swayze, Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Elwood Dalton as a former UFC fighter who has fallen on some hard times. Road House gives Elwood a chance for redemption when Frankie (Jessica Williams) recruits him to be the bouncer at her bar, which shares its name with the title of the film.\nElwood\u2019s fighting skills go a long way towards keeping order at The Road House, much to the anger of a local mobster, Ben Brandt (Billy Magnussen). Elwood took care of Brandt\u2019s regular goons with ease, but he\u2019ll have a much harder time handling Knox, an enforcer for Brandt who is played by an actual UFC fighter, Conor McGregor.\nThe Other Zoey (2023)\nThe Other Zoey is not a remake of the Sandra Bullock rom-com While You Were Sleeping. But romantic comedy fans may notice some similarities between the two. Josephine Langford stars as Zoey Miller, a high school student who is definitely not the girlfriend of soccer star Zach MacLaren (Drew Starkey), whose girlfriend is also named Zoey (Maggie Thurmon).\nWhen Zach suffers a head injury that gives him partial amnesia, he mistakes Zoey for his girlfriend, and his doctors warn her not to upset him with the truth. So Zoey carries on the deception and gets closer to Zach on a lavish vacation. At the same time, Zoey also feels attracted to Zach\u2019s cousin, Miles Maclaren (Archie Renaux), who shares many of her views about love and life. So, which guy does Zoey really want? You\u2019ll have to watch the film to find out."

      "text": "War has always been one of the most consistent sources of inspiration for filmmakers around the globe, with World War II, in particular, becoming the subject of numerous movies showcasing a variety of perspectives. These films attempt to capture one of the most devastating conflicts in history in historically accurate and often deeply personal ways, with many being hailed as timeless pieces of cinema that have gone on to educate and move countless viewers.\nFrom the unbelievably disturbing Come and See to the heart-wrenching Schindler\u2019s List, the best WWII movies portray unimaginable atrocities with profound sensitivity. These award-winning works successfully depict critical stories and moments from one of the most pivotal periods of the 20th century, ensuring that the cost and horrors of war are never forgotten.\n10. Fires on the Plain (1959)\nSet in the final days of World War II, Fires on the Plain tells the story of a tubercular Japanese soldier who, after being dismissed from his unit and hospital, wanders the desolate Philippine island of Leyte. Private Tamura (Eiji Funakoshi) struggles to survive during the waning period of the war, and he meets fellow soldiers with much worse predicaments, including insanity and starvation that leads to cannibalism. Tamura flees his own troop in a desperate bid to stay alive, only to find more horrors as he wanders around the foreign country.\nDirected by Kon Ichikawa based on Sh\u014dhei \u014coka\u2019s 1951 novel titled Nobi, the 1959 Japanese war film initially received mixed reviews but has been re-evaluated as a critical entry in the genre. Fires on the Plain asks what happens when the dust settles and the soldiers find themselves dying far from home, with the slow-burn drama film\u2018s focus on Tamura\u2019s story making it a standout WWII movie that deserves more recognition.\n9. Dunkirk (2017)\nDunkirk chronicles the titular evacuation of World War II, using three perspectives \u2014 land, sea, and air \u2014 to tell various stories about the chaos unfolding across France. The 2017 film doesn\u2019t use the typical narrative structure, choosing instead to show a variety of situations to capture the soldiers\u2019 collective struggle for survival. These moments include desperate characters trapped in a sinking boat as well as RAF pilots risking their lives to protect soldiers on the beach.\nPrimarily relying on music and cinematography and featuring little dialogue, director Christopher Nolan masterfully builds suspense and dread over the film\u2019s nearly two-hour runtime. Hans Zimmer\u2019s Oscar-winning score helps heighten that tension, with the composer\u2019s work on Dunkirk among the greatest in his career. The film thrusts audiences into the mess and unpredictability of war, with its overlapping timelines intentionally crafted to highlight the raw fear and confusion the soldiers felt during the evacuation.\n8. Casablanca (1942)\nIn director Michael Curtiz\u2019s legendary romantic drama Casablanca, Rick Blaine\u2019s (Humphrey Bogart) life changes when his former lover Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) unexpectedly enters his bar in the titular Moroccan city. Ilsa arrives with her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a Czech resistance leader being hunted by the Nazi regime. Initially reluctant to help, Rick is soon roped into their predicament when he has a passionate affair with Ilsa. He soon has to make an iconic, difficult choice at the airport.\nCasablanca is a beloved classic for a reason, with its flawless screenplay and mesmerizing performances still discussed and referenced today. Aside from being one of the best romance movies of all time, the 1942 film is also an important work in the war genre. Beyond being filmed and set during World War II, Rick\u2019s final decision underscores a powerful message about refusing to stay on the sidelines, even if it is the more comfortable choice.\n7. The Cranes are Flying (1957)\nThe Cranes Are Flying is a Soviet war film that follows the young couple Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) and Boris (Aleksei Batalov), whose lives are shattered when Boris volunteers for the army. As war devastates Moscow, Veronika\u2019s life is upended amidst the bombings and other emerging threats, notably from Boris\u2019 opportunistic cousin, Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin). After years of hardship, a guilt-inducing relationship, and an unexpected new family member, Veronika learns the terrible truth she didn\u2019t want to accept about Boris\u2019 fate on the front lines.\nGeorgian-born Soviet director Mikhail Kalatozov captures the war\u2019s widespread damage to the Soviet psyche, which was known as the Great Patriotic War in the Soviet Union. A critical haunting scene from the film contrasts the overhead flight of cranes, symbolizing hope, with Veronika\u2019s despair, questioning the cost of victory in the war. The Cranes Are Flying would have a historic win at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival, becoming the only Soviet film to take home the Palme d\u2019Or.\n6. The Pianist (2002)\nBased on the harrowing true story of Holocaust survivor W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman, director Roman Polanski\u2019s adaptation of the autobiography recounts how the gifted Polish-Jewish pianist (played by The Brutalist\u2019s Adrien Brody) lived through the Nazi occupation in Warsaw. The Pianist portrays how Szpilman, once a celebrated musician, barely survives after his family is sent to the death camps. The protagonist then scrapes by in the ruins of the ghetto that was once a thriving community, getting by on what he can find, with some help from kind-hearted individuals around him.\nThere are no overt heroes in The Pianist, with the film avoiding sentimentality in favor of a raw and intimate glimpse into one man\u2019s struggle for survival amidst overwhelming odds. Szpilman\u2019s journey is heartbreaking, especially given the stark change in his position as a beloved pianist in his city who is then forced into dehumanizing circumstances. Adrien Brody took home the Oscar for Best Actor for his performance, which he prepared for by isolating himself for months, breaking up with his girlfriend, letting go of his apartment and car, losing 30 pounds, and even taking piano lessons for four hours per day.\n5. The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai tells the gripping story of British POWs forced to construct a railway bridge over the titular river by their Japanese captors in Burma. The stoic British officer Colonel Nicholson (Star Wars\u2019 Alec Guinness) leads his men with the same discipline and rigor they trained for to be in the military, all while clashing with the equally determined Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa). Despite their captor-captive relationship, Nicholson becomes obsessively committed to building the bridge as a symbol of British strength, inadvertently aiding the enemy. Meanwhile, Shears (William Holden), an American prisoner who escaped the camp, is coerced into returning with a mission to destroy the bridge, leading to a tense showdown.\nNicholson\u2019s final realization \u2014 accompanied by a dramatic \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d \u2014 reflects his loss of perspective, which the film builds up to with its almost three-hour runtime. Director David Lean is a master of epics, and he infuses the 1957 movie with the ambitious sets and meticulous attention to detail he became known for. The Bridge on the River Kwai may tell a fictional story, but it\u2019s a riveting one that explores the madness and obsession that comes with war, especially before an inevitable defeat.\n4. Grave of the Fireflies (1988)\nThe most recognizable animated film in the war genre, Studio Ghibli\u2019s Grave of the Fireflies tells the heart-wrenching story of two siblings, Seita (Tsutomu Tatsumi) and Setsuko (Ayano Shiraishi). Directed by Isao Takahata, the movie depicts the siblings\u2019 experiences during the final months of World War II in Japan, where they\u2019re left to fend for themselves after their mother dies in an air raid. As they move from one frightening location to the next, the siblings can only rely on each other. But with food becoming more scarce and structures collapsing around them, things look grim.\nGrave of the Fireflies has earned a reputation for being among the saddest animated movies ever, especially thanks to its unforgettable and tear-jerking ending. Ghibli\u2019s signature hand-drawn gorgeous frames make the emotional events in the film even more hard-hitting, easily cementing it as the studio\u2019s most tragic tale. The 1988 movie points out the human cost of war, especially those young innocent lives who are left forgotten in the destruction.\n3. Saving Private Ryan (1998)\nSteven Spielberg\u2019s Saving Private Ryan starts with one of the most brutal and realistic depictions of war ever captured on film: the D-Day invasion at Omaha Beach. Amid the deaths and disarray, Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his team survive, only to be given the daunting task of tracking down a lone survivor somewhere in war-torn France. Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) is alone in hostile territory after his three brothers died in combat, and it\u2019s up to Miller\u2019s squad to find and rescue him before the enemy combatants run into him first.\nSaving Private Ryan is among the most popular war movies that showcased painfully accurate graphic portrayals of D-Day and what it\u2019s like to be a soldier. Spielberg would spend a considerable amount of time and money perfecting that infamous opening sequence, using $12 million of the $65 million production budget and employing around 1,500 to get it right. The 1998 movie would be a massive success, becoming a box-office hit and influencing numerous subsequent works in the genre.\n2. Schindler\u2019s List (1993)\nAnother masterpiece from Spielberg that\u2019s never absent from any discussion of the best war movies of all time is Schindler\u2019s List. Based on the astonishing true story of Oskar Schindler (played by Liam Neeson), the film follows the German industrialist\u2019s transformation from a war profiteer into a brave humanitarian. Schindler is horrified by SS-Untersturmf\u00fchrer Amon G\u00f6th\u2019s (Ralph Fiennes) cruelty in the P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp. The protagonist decides to help, and Schindler saves more than a thousand refugees by having them work in his factories during the Second World War.\nThe film\u2019s unsettling story is fittingly told in black-and-white, with Spielberg approaching it like a documentary to make it feel more authentic. Neeson is impeccably cast as the courageous Schindler, whose performance became a worthy tribute to the real-life figure. After its premiere in 1993, the film would shock the world, with countless tears shed for the young girl in the red coat and several other moments that underscored both the unbelievable loss and awe-inspiring bravery in Schindler\u2019s story.\n1. Come and See (1985)\nCome and See is a one-of-a-kind anti-war film centered on the Nazi German occupation of Belarus. Directed by Elem Klimov, it follows a boy named Florya (Aleksei Kravchenko), who discovers a rifle and naively joins the Soviet resistance against his family\u2019s wishes. Florya then finds himself in one traumatizing situation after another, including a ruthless massacre of a village where people are burned alive, as well as the demise of his own family.\nAside from exploring a side of World War II not often seen in cinema, Come and See stands out for its use of hyper-realism and surrealism to create a visceral viewing experience that replicates the deep fear and helplessness Florya experiences. His torturous arc that shows the jarring ways his youth and naivety are ripped from him is almost too disturbing to watch at times, driving home the film\u2019s anti-war message. The Soviet-era movie was banned for eight years before Klimov could fully produce it, and time has done nothing to take away from the provocative and powerful work that any fan of the genre should see at least once."

It has also been engaged in a legal battle with NASA over NASA\u2019s decision to award its lunar lander contrast to the company\u2019s competitor, SpaceX.\nThese issues aside, many people are excited about the launch and about the inclusion of William Shatner in the crew in particular, thanks to his status as a sci-fi icon."
