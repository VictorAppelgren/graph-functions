      "summary": "On August 14, 2025, Wall Street experienced a mixed day as most stocks fell following a worse-than-expected inflation report at the wholesale level, which indicated a 3.3% price increase. Despite this, gains from major tech companies like Amazon helped the S&P 500 inch up to an all-time high. Meanwhile, in the gaming industry, over 160 Blizzard Entertainment workers voted to unionize, joining a growing trend in the sector driven by concerns over job security and working conditions. Additionally, Habit Burger & Grill continued its marketing rivalry with In-N-Out by updating a billboard to reflect In-N-Out's drop in national rankings.",
