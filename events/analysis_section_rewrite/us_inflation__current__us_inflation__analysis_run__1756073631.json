      "feedback": "The draft already salients a multi‑source, near‑term stress picture but it fails to deliver a crisp 0–3 week scenario with explicit catalysts, thresholds, and invalidation rules. Actionable edits to upgrade to world‑class quality:\n\n- Structure into a tight, three‑part 0–3 week frame: (a) immediate drivers (policy/news/data), (b) near‑term catalysts/positioning, (c) expected reaction function and what levels matter. Ground each pillar to a concrete datapoint (tariffs >10% of imports; record June deficit near $692B; AC cost add‑on ~$1,500 per system; replacement price ~$13k–$14k; refrigerant R‑454B shortage; exports‑to‑imports ratio ~37%). Cite each datum at the point it’s used (IDs: 0J41Q7KTX, LLN6N4H3Z, U6HXAJR4J, LLN6N4H3Z again, 0J41Q7KTX, and the trade data reference from Forbes, if you attribute a numeric point there).\n- Build a first‑principles causal chain and make it explicit: how tariff shocks feed through import prices and consumer inflation, how energy/industrial costs influence services inflation and discretionary demand, and how central‑bank credibility (Lagarde) shapes policy responses given data momentum. Tie the chain to observable channels in the sources (tariffs/data imply policy lag; central‑bank independence supports credibility despite political pressure). Anchor this with quotes or paraphrases tied to Lagarde’s point (U6HXAJR4J) and the tariff/trade data (0J41Q7KTX, Forbes synthesis).\n- Introduce a explicit three‑scenario setup (baseline, risk‑off, risk‑on) with trigger thresholds and invalidation rules for each: baseline uses the already signaled Sep rate cut with tepid inflation; risk‑off triggers if the trade data deteriorates further or if tariffs escalate beyond the 10% threshold or the Fed pushes back on near‑term cuts; risk‑on triggers if inflation cools and market prices in a material, credible cut. State invalidation rules clearly (e.g., if CPI surprises to the upside, or if tariff data shows rerouting that keeps inflation sticky, or if the Fed signals no-cut expectations moving higher).\n- Tighten data usage and quantification: replace broad statements with discrete numbers and ranges from the sources, and keep close to the IDs: AC cost impact ≈$1,500 per system and replacement price ≈$13k–$14k (LLN6N4H3Z); tariff share >10% of imports in Q2 (Forbes/0J41Q7KTX); trade deficit ≈$692.15B (Forbes/0J41Q7KTX); export ratio ≈37% (Forbes/0J41Q7KTX); EV depreciation under 60% over five years in D‑list brands (CDBMWIUTB). Where ranges exist, present plausible bands (e.g., tariffs: 10–12% baseline; 12–15% upside). Avoid vague “costs rising” language; specify the dollar/macro channels.\n- Expand the watchlist and near‑term monitoring: Fed communications/minutes and Powell commentary (0J41Q7KTX); tariff announcements and enforcement progress (Forbes/0J41Q7KTX); Census trade data and export ratio dynamics (Forbes/0J41Q7KTX); AC/remanufacturing cost data and refrigerant supply (LLN6N4H3Z); consumer‑level cost signals in services (Las Vegas anecdote is illustrative but should be balanced with broader consumer sentiment/price data; mention 6OOEK8TUR as anecdotal if kept). Reconcile conflicts between sources by noting where one cites firm costs (LLN6N4H3Z) and another focuses on depreciation/auto dynamics (CDBMWIUTB) and why both matter for the 0–3 week path.\n- Improve transmission and invalidation logic: clearly map how the tariff shock and the Fed’s credibility path feed asset prices and risk premia in the next few weeks; explain how independence rhetoric (Lagarde) buffers policy credibility if data weakens, but could fail if inflation surprises; specify what would invalidate the constructive path (e.g., a sustained rise in core inflation, a worse‑than‑expected trade trajectory, or a dovish misstep reversing rate‑cut expectations).\n- Citation discipline and coverage: attach each concrete data point to its in‑source ID; ensure coverage of all critical sources (LLN6N4H3Z for cooling costs; 0J41Q7KTX for trade/policy; U6HXAJR4J for Lagarde/independence; 6OOEK8TUR for Vegas signal as context; CDBMWIUTB for auto depreciation). Where numbers conflict across sources, acknowledge the discrepancy and use the most relevant, timely figure with a brief note on why you trust it for the 0–3 week horizon.\n- Presentation polish: replace the single paragraph with a razor‑focused structure: one short intro sentence; three bullets (drivers, catalysts, transmission) tied to data; a concise threshold/invalidations box; a 1–2 line conclusion with the monitoring docket. If you keep a paragraph form, ensure every data claim is immediately followed by its ID in parentheses and avoid aggregating disparate threads without explicit links.\n\nThis will yield a sharper, data‑driven, credibility‑aligned 0–3 week view with actionable levels, explicit triggers, and a transparent reconciliation of conflicting strands.",
