  "title": "Phillies' Zack Wheeler Breaks Silence on Velocity Drop After Injury",
  "description": "The Philadelphia Phillies' starting rotation is stacked, and led by Zack Wheeler. Wheeler talked about his surprise shoulder injury.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies' starting rotation has been among the best in baseball this season, and Zack Wheeler is leading the way.\n\nWheeler's last start was pushed back, but he was able to start on Sunday against the Texas Rangers. His start was pushed back due to shoulder discomfort, and Wheeler noted that he had been dealing with it for \"a while,\" according to MLB.com's Paul Casella.\n\nWheeler's fastest pitch on Sunday, a four-seam fastball, clocked in at 95.5 mph, per Baseball Savant. His average velocity on that pitch this season is 96.1 mph. Wheeler spoke on the drop in velocity after the game.\n\nARLINGTON, TX - AUGUST 10: Zack Wheeler #45 of the Philadelphia Phillies pitches against the Texas Rangers during the second inning at Globe Life Field on August 10, 2025 in Arlington, Texas. ARLINGTON, TX - AUGUST 10: Zack Wheeler #45 of the Philadelphia Phillies pitches against the Texas Rangers during the second inning at Globe Life Field on August 10, 2025 in Arlington, Texas.\n\n\"I'm not concerned,\" Wheeler said, per The Athletic's Charlotte Varnes. \"I've pitched at that velo before. It will come back.\"\n\nWheeler has a 2.68 ERA in 23 starts this year. He also has a league-leading 189 strikeouts, and if his injury is something that is going to linger, it could directly affect the Phillies' World Series dreams. However, manager Rob Thomson also did not express too much concern.\n\n\"I'm not concerned,\" Thomson said, per Varnes. \"They're working at some stuff, and he just looks a little bit out of sync. The velocity's not there, but his secondary stuff was good. He got a lot of whiffs.\"\n\nWheeler finished the game with seven strikeouts, three walks and allowed just two earned runs. However, it was just the fifth time all season he had issued more than two walks, and it was tied for his shortest outing of the year.",

days due to some shoulder soreness following his last outing, Wheeler's velocity was down across the board on Sunday -- including on a first-inning cutter that Joc Pederson smashed for a two-run homer. Wheeler's usual pinpoint control -- something that has been missing of late -- also eluded him once again.\nAs it turns out, that soreness actually popped up well before last week.\n\u201cHonestly, it's been a while,\u201d Wheeler said when asked when he first felt it. \u201cIt finally just got to that point to where we wanted to go get an image of it so we could treat, specifically, what needed to be treated and not just guess.\u201d\nAnd the treatment worked?\n\u201cToday I felt perfectly normal,\u201d Wheeler said.\nWheeler clearly didn\u2019t have his best stuff in the Phillies' 4-2 victory over the Rangers at Globe Life Field. All of his pitches were down more than a full mile per hour. The most significant dropoff was with his sinker, which averaged just 93.0 mph -- down 2.5 mph from his usual 95.5. His splitter (2.2 mph), four-seamer (2.0 mph) sweeper (1.8 mph), cutter (1.8 mph) and curveball (1.3 mph) were also down.\nZack Wheeler grinded his way through 5 innings to get his 1st win in more than a month ... but his velocity was down significantly and his fastball command continued to elude him.\n\"I'm not concerned,\u201d Thomson said when asked about the velocity. \u201c ... He just looks like he's a little bit out of sync, that's all.\"\nAdded Wheeler: \u201cI'm not concerned. It'll come back.\u201d\nEven if they truly aren\u2019t concerned long term, it still affects Wheeler in the short term. Unlike rotationmate Ranger Su\u00e1rez, who has routinely proven he can be effective with diminished velocity, a big part of Wheeler\u2019s game is the ability to simply overpower hitters with his fastball.\n\"It's harder to pitch at that velo than, say 95, 96,\u201d Wheeler admitted. \u201cYou don't get as many swings and misses or as many foul balls, it's a little easier to hit.\"\nBut Wheeler did what aces do: He simply found a way to get the job done. Wheeler held the Rangers scoreless after Pederson\u2019s first-inning homer, working around three walks and three hits while striking out seven over five innings.\n\u201cThat's the type of pitcher he is,\u201d said catcher J.T. Realmuto. \u201cEven when he doesn't have his best stuff, he's going to give us a chance to win the game. He's going to go out there and compete, and he's going to find a way to get it done.\u201d\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t just Wheeler\u2019s velocity that was missing.\nWheeler uncharacteristically left a lot of fastballs up and had a number of non-competitive misses. During this recent rough patch (by Wheeler\u2019s standards), it\u2019s been the lack of fastball command that has frustrated Wheeler the most.\nThat changes things behind the plate for Realmuto, who said calling a game for Wheeler all starts with his fastball command. When it\u2019s \u201ca little erratic,\u201d as Realmuto called it on Sunday, the catcher has to pivot on the fly -- and that\u2019s not as easy with Wheeler as other pitchers.\nWhile most pitchers have a go-to breaking ball, Wheeler\u2019s go-to breaking pitch changes start to start. On Sunday, for instance, that pitch was the splitter -- the pitch he had thrown the fewest of all season.\nBut those were the type of things Wheeler, Thomson and Realmuto were focused on postgame. Command, mechanics, approach -- nothing physical.\n\u201cFelt good, felt healthy,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cStill just a little off, so just got to keep working at that.\u201d\nWheeler doesn\u2019t have all the answers for what\u2019s throwing off his command right now, but he insists it has nothing to do with the shoulder.\n\"If you've been around baseball for a while, you know guys go through different times in the season where guys might not have their best stuff for a few starts in a row,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cThat's just it for me right now. It'll come back around.\"\nThe Phillies could have skipped Wheeler\u2019s turn in the rotation had they wanted to, thanks to Thursday\u2019s off-day before the series in Texas. They won\u2019t have that luxury this time around, as they\u2019re in the midst of playing 13 games in 13 days.\nAaron Nola could be back next Sunday. Maybe the Phillies skip Wheeler at that point. Maybe they go to a six-man rotation for a while.\nFor now, they aren\u2019t worried.\n\u201cNot at this point,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cWe'll see how he feels tomorrow. That'll be the tell-tale sign. We'll just have to wait and see.\u201d"

      "text": "ARLINGTON, Texas \u2014 The fourth pitch to Joc Pederson was well inside, a fastball forcing him to lean back in the box so it would not hit his legs.\nIt was Zack Wheeler\u2019s fourth straight throw that did not get near the target catcher J.T. Realmuto set. The count turned 4-0. Pederson reached first. But the third inning ended on the next pitch, a sweeper turned flyout.\nAdvertisement\nIt was that kind of day for Wheeler. There was trouble. His velocity tumbled. He walked three batters, his most since June 25. But Wheeler, as he often does, got out of it and still struck out seven as the Phillies beat the Texas Rangers 4-2 on Sunday, completing a series sweep.\n\u201cI\u2019m not concerned,\u201d Phillies manager Rob Thomson said of Wheeler. \u201cThey\u2019re working at some stuff, and he just looks a little bit out of sync. The velocity\u2019s not there, but his secondary stuff was good. He got a lot of whiffs.\u201d\nWheeler\u2019s final line \u2014 five innings, three hits, two earned runs, three walks, seven strikeouts \u2014 seems competitive, not worrisome. But that\u2019s only if you ignore the spotty command, the falling velocity and complaints of right shoulder stiffness after his last start that prompted two extra days of rest.\nThe shoulder had been bothering him awhile, Wheeler said, so the Phillies had imaging done to find what specifically needed to be treated. He felt normal Sunday.\nBut Wheeler\u2019s velocity has fallen across all of his pitches except his splitter over the past month. His fastball averaged 96.7 mph in June. The pitch did not reach more than 95.5 mph Sunday. His sinker, which hit 95.9 mph in June, topped out at 94.1 mph against Texas.\n\u201cI\u2019m not concerned,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cI\u2019ve pitched at that velo before. It will come back.\u201d\nWheeler has not been quite right since his complete game against the Cincinnati Reds in early July. Before then, his season ERA was 2.27. Entering Sunday, he had a 4.94 ERA in the four starts after the complete game. Fastball command has been the biggest struggle, with diminished velocity playing a role as well. Still, \u201cstruggling\u201d for Wheeler remains relative; in his last multi-walk game (July 27) before Sunday, he struck out eight.\nA strong rotation has been the Phillies\u2019 calling card. Should Wheeler need to fully skip a start, they have options. They were already considering a six-man rotation upon Aaron Nola\u2019s return from the injured list. Taijuan Walker has been serviceable, finding success as the Phillies\u2019 fifth man. Nola could come back in a week\u2019s time. The Phillies could turn to a six-man or skip Wheeler, if necessary, without issue at that point.\nAdvertisement\nThomson said the extra time off could have affected Wheeler\u2019s velocity versus the Rangers. There was no plan to pull him early Sunday, but Thomson did so after 83 pitches because he felt Wheeler looked out of sync.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how he feels tomorrow,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cThat will be the telltale sign.\u201d\nA case for Harrison Bader\nWheeler\u2019s near-middle fastball sounded sharp off Corey Seager\u2019s bat in the fifth, hurtling toward right-center. Harrison Bader and Nick Castellanos backed toward the wall, where Bader jumped and extended his left arm at the wall for the catch.\n\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Thomson said.\nWE\u2019D LIKE TO REPORT A ROBBERY pic.twitter.com/Ivy3tveVTq\n\u2014 Philadelphia Phillies (@Phillies) August 10, 2025\nIt was a play that, arguably, no other current Phillies outfielder could have made. This is why the Phillies acquired Bader: not just to spark the offense, but also to provide solid defense. The 2021 Gold Glove Award-winning center fielder has delivered.\nAfter sitting in his first game with the organization, Bader has played seven games with the Phillies. He has hit .150/.261/.300 in 23 plate appearances and scored four runs. Overall this season, he\u2019s hitting .251/.333/.430 for a .763 OPS.\nHis performance is one datapoint in the outfield roulette, which the Phillies continued to play over the weekend. Thomson gave each outfielder a game off, citing the hard turf at Globe Life Field. But he said he also wanted to see everyone play to determine \u201cwho\u2019s hot, who\u2019s not.\u201d\n\u201cTo me, I\u2019m not so sure why everybody keeps talking about the outfield because it\u2019s been doing OK,\u201d Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski told The Athletic. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me who plays where or who plays versus who as long as they do well. (Brandon) Marsh has been doing well. Castellanos has been solid. Bader\u2019s part of it now at this point.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBut there is an argument to be made for Bader seeing everyday playing time. He has reverse splits this season, with a .704 OPS against lefties and a .789 OPS against righties. There is a difference there, but less volatility in how he hits same-handed pitchers compared with Marsh or (Max) Kepler. Castellanos, whom Thomson views as an everyday player, also has relatively similar splits against lefties and righties (.711 OPS against righties, .767 against lefties).\nBader\u2019s defense is a difference-maker. He ranks in the top 20 among MLB outfielders in outs above average with five. Castellanos is last with minus-11. Kepler has minus-1. Marsh has zero. It is similar with defensive runs saved, as Bader ranks sixth among outfielders with 13. Castellanos is second-to-last with minus-14. Marsh is fifth worst with minus-8. Kepler has minus-1.\nWhat\u2019s happening in Allentown?\nIt has been a busy couple of weeks for Triple-A Lehigh Valley.\nDavid Robertson came and went. Jos\u00e9 Alvarado began an assignment with the IronPigs on Thursday, ramping up as he nears the completion of his 80-game suspension for using a performance-enhancing drug. Alec Bohm (left rib fracture) began a rehab assignment Sunday. Nola has made two rehab starts and will make a third Tuesday, potentially rejoining the big-league rotation afterward.\nWhat does it all mean? Well, the Phillies are nearing a level of roster strength they haven\u2019t seen all season.\nNola has been on the IL since May 16. Alvarado was suspended May 18. Bohm was slashing .278/.324/.391 with a .715 OPS before hitting the IL on July 19.\nThey will rejoin a roster that now features closer Jhoan Duran and Bader, along with one of baseball\u2019s top rotations and Kyle Schwarber slugging his way into the MVP conversation. And the Phillies, now 5 1/2 games up on the Mets in the division, have more help on the way soon.\n(Top photo of Harrison Bader: Ron Jenkins / Getty Images)"

Inconsistencies may occur.\nThe New York Mets entered Monday having lost seven straight games and 11 of their last 12 games.\nThe team is clearly not living up to expectations right now, and the Philadelphia Phillies are starting to pull away in the National League East. Carlos Mendoza pointed at the starting rotation as one of the keys to getting back on track.\n\"We gotta get our starters going,\" Mendoza said, per The Athletic's Will Sammon.\nThe Mets' starting rotation playing better will have a positive effect on the entire team. The offense will not have to be perfect and the bullpen will be less taxed. However, the Mets will need their offense to play better at some point as well.\nThe rotation has dealt with some injuries, but the starters are going to have to start going deeper in games at some point. Against the Milwaukee Brewers, no starter completed five innings. Frankie Montas did not have a traditional start, but pitched three innings behind an opener.\nThe Mets will play two series against the Atlanta Braves, a series against the Washington Nationals and a series against the Seattle Mariners before they take on the Phillies in a critical series.\nThe Phillies entered Friday with a 5 1/2-game lead over the Mets, but Mendoza thinks the team does not need to be worried about the standings right now.\n\"We haven't played well in quite a bit now,\" Mendoza said, per Sammon. \"That's what happens. We can't be looking at the standings. We gotta start getting the job done. It's that simple.\"\nThe clock is ticking on the Mets' season, and they will need to start playing better if they want to make a deep run in October.\nMore MLB: Yankees Roster Shake-Up?
