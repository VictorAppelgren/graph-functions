  "description": "How to build a proactive and adaptive cyber defence ecosystem",
  "content": "The first half of 2025 has undeniably showcased the devastating power of data breaches and ransomware attacks. High-profile brands such as Marks & Spencer, Harrods, and Qantas Airlines have all been through cyber shockwaves, with countless amounts of employee and customer information lost to hackers. This has not only eroded brand trust but also raised serious questions about the solidity of overall business security infrastructure.\n\nThe breaches were primarily caused by social engineering attacks targeting IT help desks, which allowed attackers to gain access to systems and deploy ransomware. According to the latest insights, hackers impersonated employees to trick IT staff into granting access by requesting to reset passwords, ultimately leading to the compromise of sensitive data.\n\nAll evidence shows hackers' deep understanding of human psychology, enabling them to exploit social norms and complacency to bypass some of the most robust data security systems. Affected businesses have responded swiftly to attacks and offered timely support to those impacted; however, it\u2019s clear all businesses need to improve their cybersecurity if they are to stay safe in this ever-evolving world of cyber threats.\n\nWhile some businesses may think that investing in advanced technology will be enough to address this, it will be useless if they don't equally invest in human elements to strengthen cyber resilience and ensure long-term data security.\n\nUnderstanding how tackling human-led vulnerabilities can build a smarter, stronger, and more adaptive cyber defense system will help businesses to transform their approach to cyber resilience.\n\nElevating password security: The human element of your first line of cyber defenses\n\nAs recent data breaches have shown, password-granted access is often the breakthrough hackers need to compromise systems. Introducing key changes to how businesses manage passwords can help in the fight against nefarious actors.\n\nFirstly, small changes to password policies can add an extra layer of protection, making it more difficult for hackers to gain access. As you inspect your existing policies, DON\u2019T forget the basics! For example, personal information in passwords should be avoided as it\u2019s easy for hackers to get user logins if names, birthdays, or other personal information is directly included in passwords.\n\nIt seems simple, yes, but some of the largest organizations in the world have been breached because of the omission of basics like this. Once hackers gain access to the targeted systems, the risks of data breach is all but certain, raising the likelihood that confidential information will be exposed on malicious websites.\n\nBusinesses should therefore implement clear password policies, including setting rules for password length and complexity, and make sure you\u2019re following NIST best practices for password generation. Take scheduled password resets, NIST no longer recommends forced password changes unless there is evidence of breach. This is due to the fact that users would make highly serialized passwords in an attempt to remember them, which ultimately lowers operational security..\n\nIn addition to the password hygiene rules, the strict application of multi-factor authentication (MFA) across organizations, including their external partners, is necessary to maintain cybersecurity.\n\nHere, PINcodes and biometric authentication that require verification via a physical device (like FIDO2) help prevent unauthorized users from accessing accounts, even when passwords have been stolen. Deploying MFA across business and personal accounts enhances protection against common security threats such as malware, phishing, and ransomware attacks.\n\nWarning: while MFA helps, it isn\u2019t a catch-all safeguard. Social engineering, or the use of reverse-proxy style toolkits, allows threat actors to account for MFA during the login process. This enables the attacker to capture the target\u2019s authentication token regardless of MFA being enabled on the account.\n\nTo counter this, technologies like Passkeys should also be adopted by businesses to create additional safeguards against cyber attacks. Operated by using public key cryptography, Passkeys generate a public/private key pair whenever a new passkey is established with an online service.\n\nThe authentication response is unique for each login, which means there are no passwords to be stolen on the service end of the login process. Passkeys are also typically URL-bound, rendering reverse-proxy phishing kits useless for threat actors.\n\nStrict practices of password hygiene and the adaptation of evolving password technologies will strengthen businesses\u2019 data protection and bolster cybersecurity against unverified attempts to access accounts.\n\nWhile password security is important, to foster truly robust cyber resilience, more steps need to be taken across organizations in their day-to-day operations to maintain safety.\n\nTo embed cyber resilience into organizational culture, it is crucial to upgrade data security policies and ensure employees can implement them daily. These will foster a full-scale ecosystem of accountability and vigilance.\n\nBusinesses should implement ongoing tiered cybersecurity awareness training for their employees. Successful completion of a round of tests and simulations will automatically unlock progressively more challenging ones.\n\nThose who don't pass initial tests receive opportunities for further practice and re-testing at that difficulty level until they succeed. This approach fosters progressive cybersecurity training and rewards successful employees with less frequent testing.\n\nAdditionally, regular feedback loops, surveys or user-friendly polls can ensure the current security training stays up-to-date with cybersecurity trends, covering key topics such as phishing and ransomware.\n\nA particular focus should also target the cyber vulnerabilities faced by organizations implementing remote and hybrid work. While implementing strategies for protecting devices and networks beyond the traditional office perimeter, such as applying MFA and role-based data access, businesses should make sure there are regular software updates and enhanced firewall configurations.\n\nCISOs and IT teams should enforce a Zero Trust approach, ensuring that each user has no more than the access they need and that every connection and communication, no matter how trustworthy it may seem, is vetted for authenticity.\n\nTo stay safe from attacks, businesses must consistently refine and manage their cybersecurity strategy. Strengthening data security across all accounts is essential to minimizing data breaches and safeguarding sensitive information.\n\nAdditionally, businesses should prioritize other critical areas based on their specific risk profiles. This means a careful, case-by-case assessment of where vulnerabilities lie and where the greatest impact can be made. Focusing on the following key actions is vital:\n\n- Enforce strong password hygiene across the organization, and mandate the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Passkeys to secure the first line of defense without exception\n\n- Encourage progressive learning by implementing an ongoing, tiered cybersecurity testing program that adapts to roles, responsibilities, and knowledge\n\n- Embrace regular feedback through employee surveys and polls to keep the current cybersecurity training relevant and effective\n\n- Enhance remote and hybrid work settings by applying technical safeguards alongside a Zero Trust approach to limit data exposure and risk\n\nThe path forward requires a holistic view, a commitment to continuous adaptation, and the firm understanding that the strongest defense isn't just about tech, but the informed and vigilant human element that underpins it.\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

Now, in the digital world, heists look starkly different and cybersecurity threats are constant, with banks like NatWest facing a \u201ccontinuous arms race\u201d with around 100 million cyber-attacks every month. What used to be gangs of robbers digging tunnels and smuggling deposit boxes full of cash are now groups of hackers sending phishing emails and holding some of the most notable companies to ransom for hundreds of millions of dollars.\nThis transition from physical to digital theft is evident. No longer confined to vaults and getaway cars, today's high-stake heists are executed remotely, by online threat actors. These modern-day criminals operate across borders, targeting vulnerabilities in systems and human behavior to extract data and money. The sheer volume and relentless nature of these digital assaults, as exemplified by financial institutions battling millions of cyber-attacks monthly, highlight a new era of crime.\nSecurity Evangelist at Hornetsecurity.\nThe growing problem of cyber-attacks\nCyber-attacks are a growing problem, amongst a growing number of sectors, and confronting this escalating issue is vital. It\u2019s not just banks that are facing the constant threat of cyber-attacks; cyber threats are growing at an exponential rate, while becoming increasingly sophisticated and targeted.\nData breaches have hit a myriad of industries: from luxury brands like Dior and supermarkets like M&S, to cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and UK government organization Legal Aid.\nThe dangers to personal data are being felt across all sectors, at all digital touchpoints. Amid this battleground of immediate cyber threats comes a growing demand for robust security solutions that address company concerns.\nFrom advanced antivirus technologies to endpoint backup software, AI-powered security is evolving rapidly to stay ahead of such attacks - and it\u2019s essential that companies invest in these defenses in order to stay more than one step ahead.\nEvolution of technology\nAs technology evolves at a rapid pace, companies must keep up with advancements made by cyber-attackers. As businesses of all sizes continue to embrace digital transformation, the need to strengthen their cybersecurity grows increasingly critical.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nThe UK Government\u2019s recently published Cyber Governance Code of Practice highlights that management of cyber risks is vital for modern businesses to function, and effective management requires collective input from across an organization. This Code of Practice and governance framework package guides boards and directors in managing digital risks and safeguarding their businesses and organizations from cyberattacks.\nThe framework encourages companies to take four employee-focused actions: foster a cybersecurity culture; ensure clear policies support a positive cybersecurity culture; improve their own cyber literacy through training; and use suitable metrics to verify the organization has an effective cybersecurity training, education, and awareness program.\nThe report is a clear reminder that the human firewall, that is, the employees who encounter an attack and respond, is just as important as technological defenses.\nMore than a simple fix, a culture shift is needed\nIt\u2019s not enough to roll out generic training. The reality is that in today\u2019s world, one wrong click can bring a business to a complete halt. According to the latest insights, the approximate amount of ransoms paid globally in 2024 reached $813.55 million.\nWhen requested to pay a ransom, companies know that refusing to do so runs the risk of their customers\u2019 personal information being leaked publicly, which would additionally require them to pay the associated financial penalties and legal payouts, not to mention reputational damage.\nAddressing the threat of cyber-attacks must be embedded in a company\u2019s culture, given the fact that if threat actors are successful, the impact of their actions would be felt not only company-wide but also by the ecosystem within which the organization operates.\nLeadership and security\nOrganizations can bolster their security by cultivating strong leadership, providing tailored training, and building a proactive security culture to create a \u2018human firewall\u2019 of colleagues armed with know-how.\nEmployees of all skillsets and seniorities should undergo comprehensive and ongoing cyber awareness training, whatever their role and seniority, to drive the defenses forward and cultivate a mindful culture.\nWhen employees are provided with the knowledge and tools to maintain awareness of the dangers their company is facing, they can be the most effective method to keep the business secure.\nBuilding a mindful culture\nBuilding a mindful culture can be complemented by a Zero Trust approach, which creates a robust defense against evolving cyber threats. This strategic approach mandates rigorous verification for all access requests, irrespective of their origin or the user's location within the network, thereby yielding exceptionally strong results that effectively eliminate a significant portion of potential threats.\nFor example, when an employee receives an email requesting sensitive information or a link to a suspicious website, they should be trained to recognize it as a potential phishing attempt right away, verify the sender's identity, and report the email to the IT department for further investigation.\nThis proactive stance, ingrained through a Zero Trust philosophy and continuous education, significantly reduces the likelihood of successful breaches. It\u2019s better safe than sorry, and in the realm of cybersecurity, this means being diligent about taking the extra steps to fortify an organization's digital defenses.\nDon't stop at basic protections\nDon't stop at basic protections, make ongoing training a priority. Defenses can\u2019t stop at antivirus technology and endpoint protection, and training isn\u2019t a one-time solution. While these are the necessities, they are simply not enough for the twenty-first century heist as businesses continue to battle millions of cyber-attacks each month.\nAs threats advance or teams become complacent, ongoing phishing simulations, tests and education are key in maintaining a robust human firewall. Companies must invest in technology and ongoing training to equip employees across all roles and levels with the skills and awareness to stay alert. A company\u2019s greatest weapon can be its workforce, if leveraged.\nCybersecurity needs tech, but it's nothing without people who are well trained to understand the latest attack methods and protect against the digital transition's inherent risks.\nWe list the best ransomware protection.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "The Human Firewall: even with AI, humans are still the last line of defense in cybersecurity\nIs AI-enhanced threat detection everything it is cracked up to be?\nEven with today\u2019s vast arsenal of cybersecurity tools and AI-enhanced threat detection, attackers continue to succeed \u2013 not because the technology is failing, but because the human link in the defensive chain remains exposed. Cybercriminals almost always take the path of least resistance to execute a breach, which often means targeting people rather than a system.\nAccording to McKinsey, a staggering 91% of cyberattacks have less to do with technology, and more to do with manipulating and taking advantage of human behavior. In other words, despite technologies like AI advancing at break-neck speed, cybercriminals are still more likely to hack people than machines.\nFrom a cybercriminal\u2019s perspective, this makes sense. It\u2019s the path of least resistance. Why spend resources hacking your way through a high-tech, AI-secured front door when there\u2019s an open window around the back? This isn\u2019t news to CISOs \u2013 according to a 2024 IBM survey, almost three-quarters (74%) now identify human vulnerability as their top security risk. They\u2019re aware of the open window, and now they\u2019re trying to secure it.\nSenior Manager, Presales Engineering at One Identity.\nEasier said than done\nThat\u2019s easier said than done, however. Whether it\u2019s a well-timed phishing email, a spoofed call, a deepfake video, or a barrage of authentic-seeming push notifications designed to wear down a user\u2019s judgment, attackers are adapting faster than defenses can compensate.\nThe reality is that while security vendors race to outpace attackers with smarter algorithms and tighter controls, the tactics that most reliably lead to breaches are psychological, not technical. Threat actors are exploiting trust, fatigue, social norms, and behavioral shortcuts \u2013 tactics far more subtle and effective than brute-force code.\nIt\u2019s not a lack of technology leaving organizations vulnerable to these techniques, it\u2019s a lack of alignment between those tools and the way people actually think and operate. In fast-paced, high-pressure environments, employees don\u2019t have the bandwidth to second-guess every request or scrutinize every prompt.\nThey rely on instincts, familiarity, and patterns they\u2019ve learned to trust. But those very instincts are what attackers hijack, turning help desk tickets into access exploits, or mimicked CFOs into multi-million-dollar heists. As generative AI accelerates the realism and reach of these tactics, organizations face a critical question: not just how to keep the bad actors out, but how to better equip their people within. Because when breaches hinge on human decisions, cybersecurity isn\u2019t just a technology issue \u2013 it\u2019s a human one.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nTrust, bias, and the psychology of security breaches\nHuman behavior is a vulnerability, but it\u2019s also a predictable pattern. Our brains are wired for efficiency, not scrutiny, which makes us remarkably easy to manipulate under the right conditions. Attackers know this and design their exploits accordingly. They play on urgency to override caution, impersonate authority figures to disarm skepticism, and drip-feed small requests to trigger consistency bias. These tactics are ruthlessly calculated, and they work not because people are careless, but because they\u2019re human.\nIn early 2024, a finance worker at a Hong Kong firm was tricked into transferring $25 million after attending a video call with what appeared to be the company\u2019s CFO and other colleagues \u2013 each one a convincing AI-generated deepfake. The attackers used publicly available footage to clone faces and voices, creating a seamless illusion that exploited trust and familiarity with devastating effect.\nThe eye-opening part is that these deepfake tools are now readily available. Modern social engineering doesn\u2019t rely on obvious red flags. The emails aren\u2019t riddled with typos, and the impersonations don\u2019t sound robotic. Thanks to generative AI, deepfake technology, and access to vast training data, attackers can now create incredibly convincing personas that mirror the tone, behavior, and language of trusted colleagues. In this environment, even the most well-trained employee can fall victim without fault.\nHeuristics \u2013 mental shortcuts \u2013 are frequently exploited by attackers who know what to look for. \u201cAuthority bias\u201d leads people to follow instructions from perceived leaders, like a spoofed email from a CEO. The \u201cscarcity principle\u201d ramps up pressure by creating false urgency, making employees feel they must act immediately.\nAnd \u201creciprocity bias\u201d plays on basic social instincts \u2013 once someone has received a seemingly benign gesture, they\u2019re more likely to respond positively to a follow-up request, even if it\u2019s malicious. What so often looks like a lapse in judgment is often just an expected outcome of cognitive overload and the common, everyday use of heuristics.\nWhere policy meets psychology\nTraditional identity and access management (IAM) strategies tend to assume that users will behave predictably and rationally \u2013 that they\u2019ll scrutinize every prompt, question every anomaly, and follow policy to the letter. But the reality inside most organizations is far messier. People work quickly, switch contexts constantly, and are bombarded with notifications, tasks, and requests.\nIf security controls feel too rigid or burdensome, users will find workarounds. If prompts are too frequent, they\u2019ll be ignored. This is how good policy gets undermined \u2013 not out of negligence, but because the design of the system clashes with the psychology of its users. Good security mechanisms shouldn\u2019t add friction; they should seamlessly guide users towards better choices.\nApplying principles like Zero Trust, least privilege, and just-in-time access can dramatically reduce exposure, but only if they\u2019re implemented in ways that account for cognitive load and context. Automation can help here: granting and revoking access based on dynamic risk signals, time of day, or role changes without requiring users to constantly make judgment calls.\nDone right, identity management becomes an invisible safety net, quietly adapting in the background, rather than demanding constant interaction. Humans shouldn\u2019t be removed from the loop, but they should be freed from the burden to catching what the system should already detect.\nBuilding a security culture\nTechnology may enforce access policies, but culture determines whether people follow them. Building a secure organization has to be about more than simply enforcing compliance. That starts with security training that goes beyond phishing drills and password hygiene to address how people actually think and react under pressure. Employees need to recognize their own cognitive biases, understand how they\u2019re being targeted, and feel empowered \u2013 not penalized \u2013 for slowing down and asking questions.\nEqually important is removing unnecessary friction. When access controls are intuitive, context-aware, and minimally disruptive, users are more likely to engage with them properly. Role-based and attribute-based access models, combined with just-in-time permissions, help reduce overprovisioning without creating frustrating bottlenecks in the form of pop-ups and interruptions. In other words, modern IAM systems need to support and empower employees rather than make them constantly jump through hoops to get from one app or window to another.\nThe human firewall isn\u2019t going anywhere\nThe biggest takeaway here is that cybersecurity isn\u2019t just a test of systems, AI-driven or not \u2013 it\u2019s a test of people. The human firewall is arguably an organization\u2019s biggest weakness, but with the right tools and policies in place, it can become its greatest strength. Our goal should not be to eliminate human error or change the innate nature of humans, but to design identity systems that make secure behavior the default \u2013 easy, intuitive, and frictionless.\nWe list the best employee recognition software.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

After two weeks, it reverts to the basic free version. This has to be activated manually, but is still a top-notch security tool. We recommend running it at least once a week to check for any nasties that you haven't noticed, or if you notice that your web browser has suddenly started acting strangely (likely a result of adware).\nThe app also includes the Browser Guard extension (for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) that protects you from phishing scams, blocks annoying ads, and tracker and more. It\u2019ll also review the security settings of your operating system, and can check if credentials associated with your email address have been leaked as part of a known data breach.. Malwarebytes Premium starts at $7/year for the personal edition, and goes all the way up to $ 799.99/year for protecting 20 devices.\nMalwarebytes also offers AdwCleaner, which targets and removes annoying programs that hijack your browser by changing your homepage, resetting your default search engine, or adding unwanted toolbars. It\u2019s also available for free, and along with Anti-Malware, is a great addition to your security toolkit.\nRead our full Malwarebytes Anti-Malware review.\nBest malware removal for detection rates\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAvast offers one of the most competent internet protection suites out there. While the company is famous for providing free antivirus software, it's worth noting that this now comes bundled with an anti-malware feature that uses behavioral monitoring to spot rogue programs.\nWhat's even better is that not only are Avast's basic products free, but they are also available for mobile devices as well as for desktops, which makes Avast a particular ideal choice if you have multiple devices you need to check. The app can also optionally install the free Avast Secure Browser with built-in protection from online ads, phishing scams, and more.\nWhile the basic Avast service is second-to-none, the company also provides paid-for anti-malware software that includes things, such as fine-tuning your PC to run better, to anti-ransomware software and secure file shredding.\nFor business users, there are paid-for internet security options to cover a range of needs and options.\nFor home users, though, the Avast free antivirus should keep your PC very well protected, though do note you'll be periodically prompted to update for one of Avast's other services.\nBoth the Premium (phishing protection, and more) and Ultimate (VPN, and more) versions can protect up to 10 devices. They cost $69.48 the first year, following which Premium renews at $99.99/year and Ultimate at $139.99/year.\nRead our full Avast antivirus review.\nBest malware removal for money value\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTrend Micro Antivirus+ Security is a very capable package that's easy to use with above average anti-spam and an effective \u2018Folder Shield\u2019 module to block ransomware. And, it seems to get better as time goes on.\nHow good is it exactly? The top testing labs all rate it highly for protection, even though there\u2019s a bit of disagreement on the details. In particular, AV-Comparatives says it gives a high number of false positives, which could be a real nuisance. On the other hand, AV-Test reports high levels of accuracy and no issues with false positives at all.\nOur experiences with the product is that protection levels look similar to Bitdefender, false positives are only marginally higher, and the system itself doesn't slow down our system noticeably more than anything else.\nStandout features include ransomware protection, advanced AI learning, email scam safeguarding, and Pay Guard to protect financial transactions. It costs $19.95/year for one Windows computer. The app also includes a free browser extension (for Chrome, Edge, Firefox) that can block ads, protects against phishing attacks, and more.\nWe'd recommend running the trial for its full 30 days before you buy, then, to see if you notice any problems. But if you're unaffected, its high levels of detection and excellent bonus features make Trend Micro a good choice.\nRead our full Trend Micro Antivirus+ Security review.\nBest malware removal for ease of use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nF-Secure Internet Security is a great collection of antivirus tools, and while it's a bit pricier than some of the other antivirus software on this best of list, the number of features you get certainly makes that high price tag worthwhile.\nWith F-Secure Internet Security, you get the brilliant antivirus software from F-Secure, alongside banking protection for safe online shopping, a password manager, an unlimited VPN, and a device finder that lets you track your lost Android or iOS device, and if needs be, remotely lock or wipe it as well.\nThe package typically receives maximum marks for protection from AV-Test, and generally scores highly with AV-Comparatives. They also say it can generate significantly more false positives than most of the competition, but how that affects you will vary depending on how you use your computer.\nThe interface is a major advantage, as it's extremely easy to use, lightweight, and for the most part, you can just leave the app to work alone looking after your PC. The program has minimal effect on your system performance, and if you do need to intervene, you can generally solve any issues in a couple of clicks.\nAvailable for Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, F-Secure Internet Security remains an appealing package: fast, lightweight, and able to run alongside many other security tools without conflict. Standout features include banking protection, and ransomware protection.\nF-Secure Internet Security costs $49.99/year for one device, or $89.99 for two years. To protect three devices, you\u2019ll need to pay $64.99/year, or $114.99 for two years. Similarly, for up to five devices, the app costs $69.99/year or $124.99 for two years. Helpfully, there\u2019s a 30-day free trial to help you explore all the nooks and crannies of the app.\nRead our full F-Secure review.\nBest free malware removal\nBest free malware removal overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBitdefender Antivirus Free Edition is a straightforward security tool that offers essential protection without the complexity or clutter of a full security suite. Designed primarily for Windows users, you can use the free edition to protect up to three devices.\nThe app is very user friendly as it has a minimalistic interface, and an efficient background scanning engine. In fact, simplicity is one of Bitdefender Free\u2019s strengths. The interface is clean and the software requires little to no user intervention after installation. It scans files automatically, blocks suspicious activity in real time, and keeps out of the way unless a threat is detected.\nIn terms of malware protection, the free edition performs well since it shares the same core technology and signatures found in Bitdefender\u2019s paid products, which is a definite plus.\nOn the downside, the free edition doesn\u2019t have features, such as a firewall, a VPN, ransomware file recovery, secure browsing tools, and more, which are reserved for Bitdefender\u2019s paid products.\nOverall, Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition is a strong option for anyone who wants a set-it-and-forget-it style antivirus with solid malware protection and minimal hassle, backed by a trusted name in the antivirus market.\nRead our full Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition review.\nBest free malware removal for feature variety\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Avira Free Security Suite provides one of the most comprehensive free security packages available on the internet.\nAs well as providing the standard anti-virus protection, the Avira Free security suite also provides a software updater, as well as scanning your network for vulnerabilities and helps you fix them.\nThere are also safe browsing and safe shopping options, as well as a system optimizer to speed up your PC which is normally charged for in other packages.\nIf that's not enough, there's also a free VPN included for up to 500 MB per month, as well as a password manager (although we recommend using the best password manager for more advanced features) and privacy settings manager.\nHowever, you actually have a choice of which features you want to install. This is a great plus as while the Avira suite is generous some users may want to run one or more features through a different suite.\nThere is an upgrade option, of course, but this is priced toward installation across 5, or 25 devices, and involves such features such as removing the VPN limit.\nIf there's one negative, it's that there's no anti-ransomware protection, but aside from that the Avira Free Security Suite is a very generous package indeed.\nRead our full Avira antivirus review.\nBest free malware removal for configuration\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBacked by Avast, AVG Antivirus Free blends strong malware detection with a sleek, approachable interface that caters well to non-technical users. The app provides real-time protection against viruses, and other forms of malware.\nScans are reasonably fast, and it offers several of these including deep scans, USB scans, and performance scans. The performance scan though mainly functions as a teaser for its paid cleanup tool as many of the fixes it suggests require upgrading.\nAVG also includes web and email protection. It blocks dangerous links in browsers, warns about unsafe websites, and scans incoming and outgoing emails for malware.\nThe paid-for Pro model has more security options - it has more robust download protection, offers data encryption and includes a firewall - but the free version offers decent protection for most PC users. Most importantly though since AVG and Avast share backend technology, choosing between them often comes down to personal preference.\nRead our full AVG Antivirus Free review.\nBest free malware removal for portability\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMost security software tries to stop malware and spyware getting onto your system. Emsisoft Emergency Kit doesn't: it's the 911 call of security software, the app you use when your PC's been poked by something unpleasant.\nUnlike traditional antivirus programs that run continuously in the background, Emsisoft Emergency Kit is entirely portable. The installation process actually just uncompressed it to a folder, which can be either on the local disk, or a portable USB one. Then you run the scanner manually. This makes the app especially useful for cleaning computers that are already compromised or sluggish due to malware.\nThe interface is minimal and utilitarian, and provides Quick, Malware, and Custom scan options. Once a scan is complete, you can quarantine or delete the detected threats.\nHowever, because it lacks real-time protection, scheduled scans, or automatic updates, the Emergency Kit is not a replacement for a primary antivirus solution. It also requires users to manually update the malware definitions, which can be a limitation if you're using it offline.\nRead our full Emsisoft Emergency Kit review.\nBest free malware removal for ease of use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSpybot Search & Destroy Free Edition is a long-standing anti-malware tool that specializes in detecting spyware, adware, and other privacy-invasive threats. A popular option in the early 2000s, Spybot has since evolved to include broader protection tools, though its core functionality in the free version remains focused on manual detection and removal of malware.\nThe Free Edition of Spybot is intended as a supplement to your main antivirus program, rather than a complete security solution. It doesn\u2019t offer real-time protection, automatic updates, or full antivirus capabilities. These capabilities are reserved for its paid versions.\nWhen you install the program for the first time, it asks you whether you want to manually adjust the settings or let the software automatically configure its settings. This flexibility is great for both beginners and experienced users.\nOne of its signature features, the Immunization module, modifies browser settings to prevent your system from accessing thousands of malicious or tracking websites.\nNote however that the last stable release of the app was back in 2021, and though there have been several incremental releases since, Spybot Search and Destroy isn\u2019t as regularly updated as its peers.\nRead our full Spybot Search & Destroy review.\nWe've also reviewed the best photo storage and sharing sites and the best free backup software.\nHonorable mentions\nThere are many vendors offering solutions to keep cyberattackers at bay, so that means there are a plethora of malware removal services to choose from. With that in mind, we took a look at many more tools than the ones listed above.\nHere are a few other honorable mentions that we tested and are worth considering:\n- ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware: Malware comes in many forms and ransomware is one of the most devastating. ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware focuses on this particular problem, detecting and eliminating ransomware attacks. It was even able to restore some of our files affected by ransomware during the detection period.\n- Webroot SecureAnywhere AntiVirus: One of Webroot's major strengths is its size. It consumes hardly any system resources because it is primarily cloud-based. Webroot monitors unknown programs, virtualizes their actions so they can\u2019t make permanent changes and decides based on that whether it's malware or not.\n- ESET NOD32: This may not be the cheapest malware removal tool on the market, nor the most user-friendly, but we did find that it delivered excellent detection results. It also works across multiple devices, with the Security Home Essential plan (starting at $59.99/year) allowing you to protect three devices per account.\n- Fortect: Although primarily a PC optimizer, Fortect also does a pretty good job at removing malware. It searches for and removes malware slowing your computer down and can even alert users if malware appears in newly downloaded files in real-time.\nBest malware removal FAQs\nWhat is malware removal?\nMalware refers to any software that is designed to disrupt the operations of your computer. It could cause many negative effects such as depriving you of access to information, leaking sensitive information to a third party, or causing your device to be unusable in its entirety.\nMalware removal is the process that scans your device to detect any malware and eliminate anyone that is found. There are specific software programs built for this process, and they make use of various processes to detect malware. Most software look for malware by checking for the signature of a known malware program on your device; the companies behind these tools have large databases of these signatures that their software runs checks against. The malware removal program scans all files on your device to detect the presence of any known signatures.\nLately, malware removal programs are also employing artificial intelligence and machine learning to fish out malware, especially the type that may get past the usual process.\nHow do I remove malware from my computer?\nThere are many guides for dealing with specific types of malware, so if you know what kind of specific malware you have, there are some handy guides on how to remove malware from your computer.\nThe easiest way, of course, is to use one of the services on our guide as they do all the hard work for you. If you're wondering how malware removal works, they often check a list of known malware variants and their likely hiding places within your system. When they conduct a scan, they will check all of the nooks and crannies that are the chosen habitats for even the most elusive of malware, and then place them in to quarantine to stop the infection.\nWhile hindsight is 20-20, the first line of defense for your device should be an antivirus service that can stop infections from happening. For example, they will warn you of malicious files hidden in downloads or email attachments.\nIs free malware removal good enough?\nFree malware removal is good for one time infections, however it is worth bearing in mind that if you've been infected once, it can always happen again. That's why having a malware removal service on hand is the best course of action. So is free malware removal worth it?\nEvery second spent trying to download another service to remove malware from your device is another potentially second spent by an attacker inside your files, photos, and personal information. Plus, paid services come with added features such as real-time scanning and protection to prevent an infection from happening in the first place.\nAnother bonus of premium malware removal services is that some will even scan your system for potentially unwanted programs that could be running in the background and slowing down your device without you knowing.\nWhat are the signs that my device is infected with malware?\nThere are several key signs that your device could be infected with malware.\nSome are fairly subtle, such as your device being slower than usual or your battery draining more quickly. Other signs that could indicate an infection include an abnormal level of data usage or the appearance of apps, browser extensions, or search engines that you don't remember installing.\nPrograms could be stuttering or crashing altogether or causing your device to overheat in normal use. You may also find than your usual security software is missing or disabled and you are locked out of your administrator account.\nThe best way to know for sure is to install a malware removal program and scanning for viruses.\nHow can I continue to keep my device secure after malware removal?\nAfter you have removed a virus, you are still just as susceptible to infection as you were before unless you use an antivirus program. There are numerous choices, such as the premium options we've ranked and reviewed in our guide to the best antivirus software, or the budget-friendly free antivirus.\nA device without any protection will be quickly infected again, as hackers use automated programs to distribute their viruses wherever they can.\nWhat does real-time scanning do?\nReal-time scanning checks common places that viruses could lurk to make sure no modifications or unwanted files have suddenly appeared.\nReal-time scanning will also check each of the files you download from the internet to check for malicious code or software hidden in otherwise legitimate downloads.\nOutside of real-time scanning, many malware removal tools and antivirus software will offer a 'deep scan' function that will check every single file on your device for malware.\nHow is malware removal different from antivirus software?\nMalware removal differs from antivirus software in several key ways.\nFirstly, malware removal is a tool most commonly used after a device has been infected to find the malicious file, isolate it, and remove it while restoring access to your device. Antivirus on the other hand is used to prevent infection in the first place.\nSecondly, malware removal sometimes doesn't offer scanning capabilities. Antivirus software will often check downloads and other online files for harmful software that could damage your device.\nFinally, malware removal is often a standalone tool, whereas antivirus software will often include a complete suite of security tools including a VPN, firewall, malware removal, antivirus, password manager, and parental control in one handy package.\nHow to choose the best malware removal tool for you\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Paid or free? | Trial period | Compatibility |\n|---|---|---|---|\nMalwarebytes | Paid | 14 days | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nAvast | Paid | 30 days | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nTrend Micro Antivirus+ Security | Paid | 30 days | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nF-Secure SAFE | Paid | 30 days | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nBitdefender Antivirus Free | Free | N/A | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nAvira Free Security | Free | N/A | Windows, macOS |\nAVG Antivirus Free | Free | N/A | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nEmsisoft Emergency Kit | Free | N/A | Windows only |\nSpyBot Search & Destroy | Free | N/A | Windows only |\nOur key buying criteria\nBudget\nMalware removal tools come in different grades. Some are free while others cost money. Among the paid ones, some are more expensive than others. Ensure you pick one that suits your budget.\nFor example, if you\u2019re a student with a tight budget, there are many free or affordable malware programs you can choose from. On the other hand, if you\u2019re a corporate worker entitled to a considerable security budget, it\u2019s wise to pick more expensive and sophisticated software. It\u2019s even more important for the latter because you might be handling sensitive data that\u2019s worth a lot to your employer; being infected by malware can cause considerable damage for corporate employees, so it\u2019s worth it to invest in a good removal program.\nEffectiveness\nA good malware removal tool should be able to detect and remove threats on your device with speed and accuracy. We don\u2019t advise this, but it\u2019s possible to test the program by deliberately infecting an unused computer with malware and seeing how good it is at identifying it. You can load many malware samples and measure how quickly each program you\u2019re testing identifies and removes the samples. Look out for important statistics like the number of files it caught and how well the program could recover a device after an infection. Another key metric is the CPU load of the software; does it consume considerable resources and slow down your computer?\nExtra Features\nMany malware removal programs include extra features to entice users. For example, some include a VPN service (virtual private network) that lets you surf the web privately and anonymously. You may also find a password manager to help you manage your online accounts or a tool that monitors the dark web for leaked credentials and reports back to you if your credentials have been compromised. Either way, it's preferable to choose a program that offers extra features than those that do not. This way, you may not have to pay separately for a VPN, password manager, etc.\nEase of Use\nIt's important for any cybersecurity program to be easy to use. Most users aren\u2019t technical people, so you must not be tech-savvy to know how to navigate your way around the program. When testing a program, try to cover all its features and see if you found it easy to navigate. If not, the program could give you problems in the future. Bitdefender was the most user-friendly out of the programs we tested, and you\u2019ll likely find it easy to use.\nCustomer Support\nThings can go wrong at any time, and you should be able to contact someone for help if that happens. A lot of cybersecurity programs have customer support teams that you can contact through email, telephone, and live chat. If you have the time, you can test multiple programs to measure their response times to support inquiries.\nNote that customer support is usually reserved for paid users which makes sense because support reps cost money to train and employ. If you\u2019re a free user, you\u2019ll likely only have access to FAQs, forums, and online communities for support, which can be also valuable.\nHow we test\nTo test for the best malware removal we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service.\nWe then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nWe also referenced how well each platform scored for malware detection, and also for false positives.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nTested by\nMike is a lead security reviewer at Future, where he stress-tests VPNs, antivirus and more to find out which services are sure to keep you safe, and which are best avoided.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

In theory, you can create passwords that are as long as you want. During our testing, we were able to easily generate a random string up to a million characters long in a matter of seconds\u2014not that you would ever need one of this length.\nIn addition, you can specify what type of characters you want your password to include. Choices include alpha upper (A\u2013Z), alpha lower (a\u2013z), numbers (0-9), and symbols. Each new password comes with a unique QR code so you can transfer it to a phone or tablet as required.\nBest free password generator\nWe've also featured the best password recovery solutions.\nThe best password generator FAQs\nHow to choose the best password generator\nWhen you're looking for the best password generator to use, the first thought should be about what your needs are. If you just need just the basics for generating solid passwords to use in your internet life, then you probably won't get much use out of the higher end, more expensive platforms with advanced tools. If you require a more powerful software with added features, then consider which you'd find most useful before choosing.\nPassword Cracking vs Password Recovery. What's the Difference?\nDenis Gladysh, co-owner and head of Passcovery, a supplier of high-speed GPU-accelerated software solutions for recovering passwords of popular file formats, gave us his insight into the differences between password cracking and password recovery:\nTo date when breaking secure passwords, one uses password guessing attacks. It is as if you were actually entering all trial passwords one by one until you find the one that fits to open the file. Only in this case a program does it for you at a rate of tens-hundreds-thousands-millions-billions of passwords per second. Such a guessing technique is referred to as brute-force attack.\nHow long you'll have to wait depends on two factors: the number of words to test and the speed of brute-force attack. The longer the charset that may include the right password is, the more trial passwords there will be. As the password length is increased, the number of trial passwords will grow exponentially, for example:\nnumber_of_passwords = charset_length^password_length\nSo, in order to guess a password of only 1 lowercase Latin letter 26^1=26 trial passwords will be generated. For a 2-character password - 26^2=676. 3-character password \u2013 26^3=17576, etc.\nCracking a 1-character password of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters will require testing of 26*2=52^1=52 passwords, and in order to crack a 3-character password 52^3=140608 passwords will be generated and tested, etc.\nOur programs give perfect visualization of these calculations when you configure a brute force attack. As you change input parameters, the program estimates in real time the number of generated passwords and approximate time to completion. Now that we have covered passwords settings and the range of trial passwords, it is time to crack the password. How long will it take?\nBad news. It's going to take a while. A pretty long time actually. Remember I said that data security vendors use their own methods to deal with password hacking attacks? For example, they slow down the rate of password checking.\nMore often than not, the delay will go unnoticed (or it may leave a positive impression: \"it is taking so much time - the security level must be really high!\") when you enter one correct password, but it does slow down the speed of searching during a brute force attack.\nWhen you enter a password, a special algorithm called hashing algorithm converts the password into an encryption key, and passes the key on to the data encryption algorithm. A little too simple. And too fast. Inadequately fast. (the guys behind protection algorithms in Adobe Acrobat 9 should know what it's all about :)\nThat is why the hashing algorithm does not immediately release the encryption key. First, it hashes the key itself. Then hashes it again. And again. And again. And it goes on and on ... hundreds, thousands and even tens of thousands times. This trick is called key stretching; it is an easy way to make brute force search more time consuming by requiring repeated hashing.\nOne moment delay when checking one password turns into years of waiting when checking billions of passwords. For example, with the release of iOS 10.2 by Apple has ruled out the possibility of cracking iOS backup passwords by using 10,000,000 (ten million!) hashing iterations. Hence, the rate of brute-force search has almost dropped to zero, and GPU acceleration has become useless.\nIn this context, it becomes next to impossible to crack a random someone else's password that is completely unknown to the attacker. Especially when there is no high-performance hardware. Although it should be noted that there is always room for foolishly easy passwords that might be found in a dictionary.\nRecovering your own password is a different story. You sure have been in a situation when you promised to do something and clean forgot about it. Or some may have experienced amnesia which returned their brain to a sort of a tabula rasa state. When it comes to forgetting passwords it is never the case.\nThe password or its structure or the words of the passphrase will still be revolving in your head. The correct password will be looming somewhere within reach. It will be flickering in the dark and feebly hovering over among similar ones. Just like those glittering winged keys in the underground chambers of Hogwarts School.

      "text": "Best business password manager of 2025\nSecure Your Business Credentials\nWe've tested and ranked the best business password managers, to make it simple and easy to improve your business security with password management.\nPassword management is increasingly essential for ordinary internet users with so many passwords to remember from so many websites, it's impossible to remember them all. Additionally, it's easy to fall into the bad habit of using the same password for multiple accounts, which ensures that if one account is compromised then the rest can also potentially be hacked.\nWhen it comes to running a business, though, the issue becomes amplified, with tens, hundreds, even thousands of employees all having to use passwords that must not be compromised. This can be even more of an issue when employees may be working outside the office, such as at home, but still require secure access to workflows.\nThis is where the best business password managers come into play, adding an essential layer of security while also making it easy to control employee security.\nOf course, password security is important for any individual user and their personal accounts, but as a business, basic protection against fraud and malware attacks is paramount: these risks are only becoming more pronounced as small and medium-sized companies are increasingly being targeted by threat actors.\nFortunately, there are many highly secure, innovative, and affordable password managers designed for organizations to use. So here we have compared the best business password managers on their pricing structures, interface, ease of use, and overall robustness of security, taking into account important aspects such as end-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication, TLS protocols, and more.\nAlso, see our verdict for the best password manager overall.\nReader Offer: Get 30% off on the Business plan for 1 and 2 year subscriptionNordPass provides an easy-to-use and highly secure solution that most businesses will love, according to Techradar editors. Click on the link and proceed to checkout, the coupon code is automatically pre-applied.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nThe Best Business Password Managers of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest overall business password manager\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNordPass is a very strong contender when you're considering the best business password management software out there. It is highly secure, easy to use, widely supported, and more affordable than some other providers.\nSome of the features we like most about NordPass include biometric authorization and support for various multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms including authenticator apps, and security keys. Password sharing is another business-oriented feature that makes the platform ideal for organizations. All these features are available in all the three pricing tiers.\nWe also like the platform\u2019s zero-knowledge security architecture, which uses the end-to-end XChaCha20 encryption algorithm to ensure data is never compromised.\nNordPass is a good value proposition, and a compelling option for a password management solution. However, while it can provision users and groups from directory services like Entra ID and Okta, this feature, along with support for single-sign on (SSO) is only available to users of the top-tier Enterprise plan, which isn\u2019t ideal.\nFor great savings, take a look at the NordPass promo codes currently available.\nRead our full Nordpass password manager review.\nBest business password manager for general use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDashlane is one of the biggest names in password management, and the company has three plans aimed at businesses: Standard, Business, and Omnix. All plans benefit from what Dashlane describes as its \u2018best in class security architecture\u2019 with AES 256-bit encryption plus two-factor authentication.\nThe lower-tier Standard plan, designed for small businesses with up to 10 users, equips them with all the basic features they need to inculcate good password hygiene. Users can store and share credentials and more, and you as admins can manage everything from a centralized console.\nFor midsize organizations, Dashlane\u2019s upper-tier Business plan offers granular sharing controls, and can ease user management with support for SSO and System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) provisioning. All your users get a free friends & family plan, and a free VPN thanks to Dashlane\u2019s tie-up with Hotspot Shield.\nLarger organizations with over 100 users can contact Dashlane for a custom quote for the Omnix plan, which they claim offers \u2018advanced credential risk insights\u2019.\nDashlane comes equipped with a commendable user-friendly interface, which is always good \u2013 and in our eyes it looks sleeker than many of its peers. Perhaps the main downside here is that it\u2019s not the cheapest password management system out there by any means, demanding slightly more of an outlay than, for instance, NordPass.\nOn the upside, there is a 14-day free trial available right now so you can get a good idea of exactly what the service will do for your business (and you can benefit from our exclusive 20% discount if you use the code TechRadar20Off when signing up).\nRead our full Dashlane password manager review.\nFind the best deals on Dashlane products with our Dashlane promo codes.\nBest business password manager for administrators\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRoboform offers a robust and powerful business password management solution that boasts of all the features you\u2019d expect from a product designed to protect your business credentials. Password generation, sharing, and syncing are included, as is account provisioning from major IdPs, as well as SSO technology.\nThe platform also enables admins to enforce strong security policies, and exercise control over password management through an easily navigable, and well documented web-based admin interface.\nOne of RoboForm's key benefits for businesses is the ability to grant role-based permissions, which helps ensure that your users have access only to the credentials and passwords relevant to their role within the organization. Roboform supports all the popular desktop and mobile operating systems, and you can also restrict access based on device type for additional security.\nAs is the norm, the cost of RoboForm depends on the number of licenses you are purchasing, as well as the length of the subscription. Additionally, it offers discounts of 25% and 33% for three-year and five-year memberships, respectively.\nRead our full Roboform password manager review.\nBest business password manager for scalability\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nKeeper is a top-notch password management solution for businesses with subscription plans to suit every company, from smaller outfits up to enterprise plans.\nAll of Keeper\u2019s business plans give each staff member a private vault to manage their passwords, and the ability to share encrypted folders across users or teams. All users also get a free family plan, which is a definite plus.\nAdmins can manage user groups, enforce password security or data security policies across the organization, as well as perform security audits (with robust reporting tools at their disposal). It also lets users create shared team folders, and offers several two-factor authentication mechanisms, as well as biometric passwordless logins.\nAll this power is backed with an intuitive interface so it doesn\u2019t feel like a chore to use the password manager, and Keeper provides tight security in the form of strong encryption and a strict zero-knowledge policy (with regular independent audits to back the latter up).\nRounding everything off is the fact that customer support is excellent, with quality chat support and some sterling video and help articles.\nHowever, one of its biggest downsides is that it offers some essential business features like AD and LDAP sync, SCIM provisioning, and SSO authentication only as part of the Enterprise tier, which doesn\u2019t have a fixed pricing.\nAlso, some of the features that are built-in in some of its peers, like secure file storage, or the ability to monitor the dark web for breached credentials, are offered as extra add-ons with Keeper. So, while the Business Starter, and Business plans are competitively priced, throwing in some of these add-ons can make them a little more expensive.\nRead our full Keeper Password Manager review.\nBest business password manager for versatility\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWe\u2019ll say this right away: ManageEngine Password Manager Pro is not the tool to buy if you want small business password management or a family product. It\u2019s a high-end tool for enterprises and large businesses, and both its price and feature set reflect that status.\nIf you\u2019ve got the budget and you need a high-end password management tool, though, there\u2019s not much better than this. It\u2019s just as good as its rivals, and you only need to consider which of its three editions has the features and integrations that your organization needs.\nThe Standard Edition, which starts at $595, has tons of password and user management features including active directory integration. The Premium Edition, starting at $1395, adds more enterprise-class password management features such as remote password resets, session recording, and more. To access every feature though you\u2019ll need the top of the line Enterprise Edition, which starts at a whopping $3995.\nAlso, unlike a majority of its peers, Password Manager Pro is a self-hosted password management solution. While this ensures your business credentials stay under your control, it also adds the overhead of setting up and managing your own server.\nOverall, it\u2019s not cheap, but ManageEngine Password Manager Pro delivers superb performance and versatility for enterprises.\nRead our full ManageEngine Password Manager Pro review.\nBest open source business password manager\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe one unique aspect that separates Bitwarden from other business password managers is its open source nature. In addition to leveraging industry-standard security mechanisms, the platform\u2019s open source nature means anyone can review and scrutinize it for vulnerabilities. This transparency will help build trust and provide peace of mind for businesses using Bitwarden.\nIn terms of features, Bitwarden\u2019s two business plans offer enough to help organizations of all sizes manage their credentials efficiently.\nCentral to the platform is the organization vault that houses company-wide credentials. Credentials in this vault can be assigned to specific collections, which can then subsequently be shared with groups, departments, or teams.\nThe platform enables you to assign roles to users, and also define collection permissions. Between the two you get fine-grained control over the use and sharing of credentials, and other sensitive information in your organization.\nIn addition to this shared vault, all users also get a personal vault that only they can access. Users of the Enterprise plan also get a complimentary family plan to secure the credentials of up to six family members.\nThen there\u2019s the Bitwarden Send feature that enables your users to encrypt and share sensitive information, such as text or files, with people both inside or outside your company.\nOne downside of the platform, and though it\u2019s a matter of personal choice, we aren\u2019t really impressed by the platform\u2019s interface. It feels outdated and drab as compared to the dashboards you get with some of its peers. Also while the platform lets you define all kinds of security policies, it does lack some features such as the ability to restrict access based on apps, or location.\nRead our full Bitwarden password manager review.\nBest business password manager for SMBs\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLogMeOnce offers a good balance of features between its plans for business users, especially for SMBs.\nThe Team plan is good for small setups and covers all the essentials like a secure vault for each user, two-factor authentication, passwordless logins, and the ability to share credentials and other secure data.\nMid-sized organizations get the convenience of automatic user provisioning and management thanks to the support for hosted and online directory services, and SAML-based SSO services.\nWe are particularly impressed with its role-based access control and delegated administration capabilities that ensures the right people have just the right amount of access to the privileged information housed in the platform.\nThe platform also offers a couple of interesting features that we think would make sense to SMBs. There\u2019s Cloud Encrypter that\u2019ll encrypt your files and photos in your favorite cloud storage platform, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, and others. It also offers its own encrypted file storage service. One of LogMeOnce\u2019s stand out features is its support for a wide range of 2FA options, including its home-brewed mechanism called Selfie-2FA.\nThe only real drawback of the platform is that it\u2019s relatively expensive as compared to many of its peers. NordPass\u2019 Enterprise plan, for instance, is cheaper and is a close match in terms of features.\nRead our full LogMeOnce review.\nBest business password manager for data security\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOne of the best things about Proton Pass is that it\u2019s built by a company that has built a reputation for delivering secure, privacy-focussed products like Proton Mail. The company is headquartered in Switzerland, a country that\u2019s well-recognized for their stringent data protection laws. To top it all up, Proton Pass is open source, which allows businesses and the security community to review, inspect, and verify the platform for any vulnerabilities.\nProton Pass is a very capable business password manager. It can help your users create organization-wide, or department, and team-specific vaults to share credentials, and other secure data. It also enables them to share the vault with other users in the same team or department, with granular access permissions.\nTalking of sharing, your users can also use Proton Pass to share with non-Proton users via the Secure Links feature. This enables them to create unique, expirable links to your login credentials, secure notes, and other items.\nOne unique feature is its Proton Sentinel program that\u2019s available to all business users. The Sentinel program helps thwart unauthorized attempts to break into your account, even if the attackers have the correct password.\nAll things considered, the only real downside of the platform is that it isn\u2019t the cheapest option on offer.\nRead our full Proton Pass password manager review.\nBest business password manager for security\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n1Password is a password management solution that provides protection for individuals, families and businesses. While the company does offer a consumer version, organizations that sign up for 1Password Business also get access to free family accounts for all of their team members (much like Dashlane's Business plan).\nThere are three plans available depending on the size of your organization. 1Password Business' Teams plan is best suited to startups and small businesses while its Business plan will likely appeal to larger organizations. It's worth noting that you will have to sign up for the Business plan or higher to claim the free family accounts for your team. There is also an Enterprise plan available but you will need to contact the company for a custom quote.\nBusinesses will appreciate the platform\u2019s shared vault system. It also enables admins to exercise granular control over who can view, edit, copy, share, or export items within the vaults.\nFor additional security, you can also restrict access to the vault by apps. So you can block access via mobile apps, if you only want your users to access the vaults from their Windows, macOS, or Linux machines.\nAnother business-friendly feature is the support for guest users, who are allowed limited access to specific vaults. This feature is ideal for businesses that work with external contractors, and freelancers.\nThat said, depending on the features you need, the price of the platform can be a hindrance. For instance, it offers SSO integration in the $7.99 Business plan, though you can get it with RoboForm Business for half that price.\nTo ensure you're getting the best deal, browse our 1password promo codes.\nRead our full 1Password password manager review.\nBest affordable business password manager\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you are looking for a business password manager for a small team of users, Sticky Password offers a compelling option.\nThe platform includes all the essential features such as password generation, password autofill, automatic syncing, dark web monitoring, and encrypted storage of credit cards and digital notes.\nThere\u2019s also a password sharing feature that businesses will appreciate. Sticky Password also enables you to select users who can access critical accounts in case of emergencies. We also like its local Wi-Fi sync feature, which allows users to share passwords over the local Wi-Fi network, ensuring the data stays within your network.\nAnother attractive feature of the platform is its pricing. Sticky Password is one of the cheapest password managers around, which makes it an ideal option for smaller businesses.\nThat said, if you are a larger organization and features such as active directory and single-sign on integration are essential for you, it\u2019s better to look elsewhere.\nRead our full Sticky Password review.\nWe've featured the best password generators.\nBusiness password manager FAQs\nHow do I choose the best business password manager?\nWhen choosing from the best business password managers for yourself, start with assessing the size of your business and the kind of tools that'd be best suited for the work you do. If you run a small business, a simple business password management solution may be apt, but larger businesses will need more robust and reliable solutions.\nLook out for features like end-to-end encryption, TLS protocols, single sign-on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication. You'll also want to evaluate the password management solution's pricing plans and opt for a suitable tier for your business needs.\nCustomer support is another vital consideration. Some password managers will offer 24/7 live chat or telephone support in their plans, while others may only offer email based support with no reply timeframe.\nWhy should I use a business password manager?\nBusiness password managers provide your security teams with granular insight into your organizations overall security posture, and are one of the best ways to enhance your business security strategy. Most business password managers will have a dashboard that displays the strength of your organizations' passwords as a whole, as well as granular insight into individual employees. Password managers can also point out weak and reused passwords that could put your business at risk of a breach.\nBusiness password managers can also help your organization with compliance, especially for regulations that require your business to demonstrate data access control. Failure to meet the requirements set by these regulations can result in fines and reputational harm. Common regulations that US-based businesses may need to comply with include HIPAA (patient data), SOX (financial reporting), GLBA and PCI DSS (consumer financial data), and even GDPR for business that handle data from the EU.\nJust like a personal password manager, business password managers reduce the need for employees to constantly remember unique and lengthy passwords that slow down business operations when logging in. By providing employees with a password manager that has autofill capabilities and passkey support, you can reduce the friction experienced by employees and improve productivity.\nEmployees can also benefit from using a password manager by learning about the importance of credential security, especially when it comes to common cyberattacks that businesses face such as phishing. Phishing attacks are one of the biggest causes of business compromise, but a business password manager can stop these attacks in their tracks by recognizing malicious login attempts using stolen credentials. Additionally, the use of two-factor authentication or passkeys can make remote phishing attacks redundant as the attacker would need access to an employee's physical device and/or biometrics (such as a facial or fingerprint scan) in order to access an account, even with the correct password and username combination.\nMany of the best business password managers offer integrations with other security tools. For example, many of the password managers listed above offer integrations with Identity Management and Single Sign-On (SSO) tools such as Entra ID and Okta. Businesses looking for a full suite of secure office software could also consider Proton's Business Suite, which includes a secure email client, calendar, secure business VPN, password manager, and cloud storage in one subscription.\n\"How to choose a strong password\"\nCraig Lurey, CTO and Co-founder of Keeper Security, provided with his views on how to create a solid password below.\n\u201cUnique passwords are an essential component of enterprise security. It\u2019s imperative for today\u2019s workforce to keep in mind the heightened risks that result from weak passwords, which can operate as a skeleton key to every access point within an organization\u2019s network. There are a few rules of thumb to note when creating a password that cannot be overlooked.\nMost importantly, do not recycle passwords. This is a common habit that serves hackers well. When one account is hacked, a cybercriminal has the login information attached to every account you own. Instead, find ways to ensure variety across your passwords. Rather than pulling from personal information like your birthday, your name, or the names of family members -- use a long list of random words chained together, making sure to incorporate numbers, alternating cases and symbols.\nHowever, remembering and properly storing passwords can be very difficult. A password management platform closes the authentication and encryption gaps across the entire enterprise, on every single device.

If you go monthly, the price rises to $15 per month per seat. The Starter plan adds more to everything that was available with the free option, in addition to new features such as simple ticket automation, conversation routing, and email and in-app chat support.\nLarger teams or businesses might want a more comprehensive solution, which starts at $90 per month per seat for annual billing, or $100 per month per seat for monthly billing.

      "text": "Best online cybersecurity course of 2025\nLearn how to secure your IT\nWe list the best online cybersecurity courses, to make it simple and easy to access cybersecurity online courses for free or at reasonable prices.\nWe've listed both free and paid-for courses, proving that it doesn't need to be expensive to become qualified in cybersecurity.\nFor long-term career development, while you will ideally need to take a degree or other accredited course in computer science, in which you can choose networking and security topics to suit your career path, there are other options available that you can try in order to test the waters and see whether the industry really is for you.\nOne of the best ways to do this is by signing up for a free online taster course, which introduce some of the basics. These are a great way of seeing if this is the sort of career you'd like.\nEven still, some of the free providers do also provide paid courses which are often cheaper than undergraduate study, and may allow not just for suitable training but also industry connections to help on your path.\nTherefore if you really are interested in exploring cybersecurity, try some of these featured courses to get an idea of whether you might suit the industry, and vice versa, but do be aware that any free training will generally be quite limited.\nAdditionally, check our featured best free VPN.\nReader offer: Top courses from $14.99 when you first visit Udemy\nUdemy is an online learning platform where you can access over 25,000 courses all taught by professionals. Choose from a vast course catalog with topics ranging from programming to lifestyle.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nThe best online cybersecurity courses of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest online cybersecurity course overall\nReasons to buy\nLike Future Learn, Coursera offers a range of short courses for distance learning, including a number of cybersecurity ones such as \"Cybersecurity Specialization\" which was created by the University of Maryland to bring the underlying concepts of the construction of secure systems directly to your web browser.\nIt consists of five courses in total, each of which can take several weeks to complete. These range from Usable Security to a Cybersecurity Capstone Project, so it\u2019s safe to say that they'll require you to already have some intermediate cybersecurity know-how under your belt.\nThere are additional cybersecurity courses available, though, covering everything from the basics to more advanced specializations.\nThere are also online degrees available in either computing and IT or data science, although none are focused specifically on cybersecurity, you can be assured that cybersecurity will be a significant part of the curriculum.\nOverall, Coursera isn't so well-presented as Future Learn, but there are potentially more accredited options for study through it.\nRead our full Coursera learning platform review.\nBest budget online cybersecurity course\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTypically, courses on Udemy cost money, but we\u2019ve found a few worth checking out that won\u2019t put a dent in your bank account.\nThe \"Cyber Security Course for Beginners - Level 01\" could also be advantageous to take, not only for cybersecurity enthusiasts but for anyone who want to learn more about the subject. This particular course offers free video content, but you will not receive a Certificate of completion, instructor Q&A or direct messages.\nHowever, Udemy's real selling point is that not only does it offer some very in-depth courses, many of these courses are extremely cost-effective.\nPaid courses worth looking for for include \"Cyber Security Crash Course for Beginners: Learn From Scratch\" but there are also others to consider such as \"The Data Science Course 2020: Complete Data Science Bootcamp\" which will help provide an insight into the intricacies of computer science.\nIt's worth underlining just how comprehensive and intensive the paid courses can be, and while they may not carry any traditional educational accreditation they could be excellent options if you wanted to consider working as a freelancer to build up some experience, and in a very cost-effective way, too.\nRead our full Udemy learning platform review.\nBest short online cybersecurity courses\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFuture Learn offers a wide range of short and free online sources, with the opportunity to pay for certificates of participation either at the course level or else access all content for a set fee. The courses themselves are well-presented in short and easy to work sections that make learning simple and interesting.\nThe \"Introduction to Cyber Security\" offers a free taster to the subject, and is accredited by UK Government intelligence organization GCHQ, global accreditation and examination institute APMG International, and The Institute of Information Security Professionals. However, there are also a small number of accredited degrees available in IT and computer science which includes a masters degree in cybersecurity.\nOverall, while Future Learn is more focused on general introductory short courses, there are paid-for and accredited learning opportunities available through the platform.\nRead our full FutureLearn learning platform review.\nBest military-grade online cybersecurity course\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNexGenT was created by two US Air Force veterans with extensive experience teaching and training network engineering and cybersecurity.\nThe cybersecurity track features two courses: Basic Training, which serves as a prerequisite, and Cyber Security Specialization. Experienced candidates, however, can skip Basic Training by taking a series of tests to prove their skills.\nBasic Training prepares you for both Full-Stack Network Associate (FSNA) and Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certificates. No prior experience is necessary, and the course is self-paced, so you can start and finish at any time.\nThe \"Cyber Security Specialization\" training course takes place over 22 weeks, covers everything you need to know to protect businesses from cyberthreats, and includes access to NexGenT\u2019s Career Services, which helps students enter the workforce upon completion.\nThe base tuition for the Cyber Security Specialization Program is costly up front at $10,500, or you can choose zero-fee tuition and pay 10% of your salary only once you have a job with a $40,000 salary. After seven years, all remaining debt is forgiven, even if you haven\u2019t paid a cent. That\u2019s how confident NexGenT is that you\u2019ll find a job and earn a living. (Although, the zero-fee tuition option seems not to be available at the moment)\nThat confidence is backed up with some impressive figures: more than 50,000 enrolled students, 460,000 classes taught, and a number of success stories attesting to the effectiveness of their training.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a solid and structured way to enter the professional world of cybersecurity, this may be the right course for you.\nFor more information, read our full NexGenT review.\nBest accredited online cybersecurity course\n5. Open University\nReasons to buy\nThe UK's Open University (OU) is a leader when it comes to distance learning, having spent decades developing its courses, and it serves an international range of students. The online portal for students is excellent with information clearly laid-out, with different modules having clear timetables to work to.\nEven better is that the courses are tailored toward people of all abilities, and do a fantastic job of easing the inexperienced and unqualified into what can be quite deep and advanced topics, while actively trying to prevent students from feeling overwhelmed.\nThe OU offers a dedicated online degree in cybersecurity, as part of its wide range of flexible Computing and IT honors degree courses, where you can choose to focus in different areas, all of which will show a concern for security issues. The OU also offers a dedicated degree in Data Science.\nFor the full 3 year course, the cost is around $21,500.\nThe big advantage of the OU is that it can deliver an accredited degree in computing internationally, and aims to embrace all learners while allowing them to define their own learning path. Additionally, you can take up to 16 years to qualify for your degree through part-time learning.\nBest free online cybersecurity courses\nBest extensive online cybersecurity course\n1. Cybrary\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAs the name suggests, Cybrary is an online library for cybersecurity, IT and other InfoSec-related study materials. After creating a free account, you get access to almost 500 courses, each ranked by their difficulty and all of them free.\nYou can filter classes by level \u2013 Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced \u2013 or by vendors like Cisco, (ISC)2 and Microsoft. Whether you want to learn the fundamentals of malware or the art of the Jedi mind trick, both of those curriculums are given equal prominence in Cybrary\u2019s extensive course catalog.\nWhat is especially good about Cybrary's courses is that they tend to focus on specific aspects of IT, which means if there are areas you'd prefer to specialize in then you can focus on that rather than have to take a larger course to access it.\nBest government online cybersecurity course\n2. CISA\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCISA (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency) is part of the US Department of Homeland Security, and is an obvious source of cybersecurity expertise.\nHowever, you may not have been aware that you don\u2019t have to travel all the way to the United States to benefit from the vast experience of US government security experts, or that you can do so for free.\nThe DHS has a calendar full of training events you can attend in Idaho Falls, but for everyone who doesn\u2019t live in the midwestern US there\u2019s an entire portal of online courses available to those involved in the security of industrial control systems.\nBest general online cybersecurity course\n3. Open Security Training\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIts website looks like what you'd get if you took all the slideshows and teaching materials from a university cybersecurity department and uploaded them to a domain sporting the most minimalist user interface of all time, but Open Security Training is host to a range of intermediate and advanced classes, along with a swath of beginner lessons that any newbie would be a fool to pass up.\nThere\u2019s a whole rundown on the x86 and x64 architectures wielded by Intel processors, along with introductions to topics along the lines of cellular security, network forensics and vulnerability assessment.\nBest online cybersecurity course for beginners\n4. Heimdal Security\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFrom the same firm that brought you The Daily Security tip comes Heimdal Security\u2019s Cyber Security Course for Beginners. Although this, too, is email-based, its syllabus is significantly more extensive than that of The Daily Security Tip.\nThe Cyber Security Course for Beginners delivers a new lesson every two days for five weeks, and all without the need to pay back any tuition loans. In terms of content, it aims to give you step-by-step advice for keeping your personal data out of nefarious hands.\nBest basic online cybersecurity course\n5. Sans Cyber Aces Online\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIt\u2019s undeniably basic, and yet SANS Cyber Aces provides a nice little introduction to online IT and cyber security that's easy to follow and understand.\nAfter reading through a series of comprehensive entries about operating systems, networking and system administration, you can register for a quiz that puts your expertise to the test. Should highlighted talking points such as installing Linux virtual machine software or basic PHP, Bash and PowerShell web scripting pique your interest, you\u2019ll be in for an engaging lecture.\nWe've also featured the best password manager.\nBest online cybersecurity course FAQs\nWhich online cybersecurity courses is best for you?\nWhen deciding which of the best online cybersecurity courses to use, first consider what level of competency you are currently at. If you've not learned cybersecurity before then it would definitely be recommended to start with the beginner courses, as these will break you into the basics you'll need before you cover more advanced tools. However, if you already have a decent amount of experience with cybersecurity then feel free to try your hand with the more advanced courses.\nHow we tested the best online cybersecurity course\nTo test for the best online cybersecurity courses we searched for a range of popular options as well as took recommendations from people we know who are learning cybersecurity or who are already competent with it. Then we followed the tutorials to get an idea of how easy they were to follow, how easy it was to learn essential tools and processes, and additionally what sort of user level the courses were aimed at, such as beginner, medium, or advanced-level users.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "The resilient retailer\u2019s guide to proactive cyber defense\nReactive security is no longer viable in an age of rising cyber threats\nRecently, a spate of high-profile, malicious cyberattacks on the retail sector has thrust the risks of a breach into the spotlight once more.\nIn April, Co-op disabled its IT systems to prevent attackers from installing malware. Since then, the company has faced problems with ordering and stock management, although spokespeople say they avoided the worst outcomes of the breach.\nAttackers hit fellow retailer M&S even harder. M&S stopped accepting online orders, leaving shelves bare, following a successful cyberattack. The company is still navigating the aftermath of the breach, estimating business operations won\u2019t return to normal for months.\nThe common thread between these high-profile retail breaches? Attackers used employee data to execute SIM swaps and gain system entry\u2014a tactic that\u2019s growing in popularity at an alarming rate.\nField CISO, Expel.\nSIM swapping involves attackers using stolen personal information to impersonate individuals and contacting their mobile carriers, fraudulently claiming to need a new SIM card due to loss or damage.\nIf they\u2019re successful, the mobile carrier then transfers the victim\u2019s mobile number to the new SIM card and delivers it to the attacker, allowing the attacker to bypass two-factor authentication and gain access to the victim\u2019s accounts.\nThe National Fraud Database reports a 1,055% increase in SIM swapping attacks in 2024. Unsurprisingly, SIM swapping falls under the \u201cidentity-based\u201d attack umbrella, which is consistently the largest threat organizations face year-over-year, accounting for 66.2% of all security incidents among Expel customers in Q1 2025 alone.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nWith M&S confirming that human error caused the fallout, it's clear attackers continue to exploit human\u2014and credential-based vulnerabilities\u2014leaving organizations at risk for potentially catastrophic financial and reputational loss.\nThe rise of vulnerabilities in internet-facing network appliances\nOut of the threats Expel observed in Q1 this year, 20.9% were non-targeted malware attacks\u2014many of which were delivered through misconfigured or exposed appliances, such as firewalls and VPNs.\nExploited appliances are likely used as broad entry points, not just in targeted attacks, but also through mass scanning and opportunistic exploitation of common misconfigurations or vulnerabilities. These appliances normally create a protective barrier for systems, but can provide a springboard for attackers when compromised.\nElsewhere, ClickFix techniques\u2014where attackers manipulate users into executing malicious code via fake update-prompting pop-ups\u2014contributed to 51% of all malware incidents and 78% of all infostealer malware incidents that we observed in Q1 this year. This includes the likes of CAPTCHA and QR codes, which trick users into infecting their own computers.\nThe increased use of these techniques reveals how relatively easy vulnerable endpoints can be turned against an organization. Even seemingly small user interactions, or passing appliance misuses, can result in code execution, turning protective systems like VPNs and firewalls into liabilities.\nEnhancing security hygiene and reducing risks\nRobust security hygiene is vital for protecting critical systems, as it only takes one lapse to create critical access points for threat actors.\nRegularly updating systems and emphasizing security hygiene among employees can reduce exposure to threats. For example, organizations should enforce the use of the best password managers for all employees, including contractors or freelancers. Exercising security best practices helps ensure that the org isn\u2019t an easy target for attackers, and could even encourage them to move on to different targets.\nBusinesses can also consider using managed detection and response (MDR) services to ensure that threats can be identified, prioritized and resolved efficiently, whilst any suspicious activity can be spotted, flagged and dealt with. It\u2019s now more a matter of when, not if, attackers get in, and having the ability to identify and neutralize threats quickly is critical for minimizing business disruption.\nThis is so true that when I was at Microsoft, we had a mantra in everything we did in cyber. \u201cAssume breach. Design your environment with the assumption that attackers will succeed.\u201d This changes the perspective of cybersecurity completely.\nTo stay ahead of threats, it\u2019s imperative that security and IT management sets aside time to run tabletop simulations of real-world cyber incidents, bringing key stakeholders across the business\u2014think CFOs, communications managers, CEOs\u2014 come together to practice incident response in a collaborative way.\nThis focuses on decision-making and processes, and tests an organization's response plan by identifying gaps, reinforcing team roles and enhancing communication. These exercises help an organization build and develop its own incident response muscle, helping tame the intense stress that can be seen during an actual cyber incident.\nWhy businesses need a cybersecurity playbook\nRegardless of the layered protection organizations put in place, the ever-increasing threat of credential-based attacks means that a cyberattack can\u2014and most likely will\u2014still occur.\nTherefore having concrete and stress-tested plans for incident response in place is pivotal. This means having visibility into the affected systems, and the ability to both contain and mitigate successful attacks.\nThese recent incidents are a reminder of the potentially devastating, long-term business impacts that result from successful attacks.\nM&S, for example, estimated that its loss of profits from this security incident would total approximately \u00a3300 million once it fully restores its services.\nCo-op reacted quickly, taking its IT systems offline when its security team detected attackers in their system. As a result, Co-op is reportedly recovering faster than M&S, proving that a proactive, coordinated, and predetermined security plan can save companies millions.\nThese recent examples of UK retailers emphasize the pressing need for organizations to be prepared for abnormal access behaviors and credential misuse.\nAct now, save later\nThe data shows that attackers are targeting identity tools, exploiting misconfigured systems, and using automation to scale their attacks. In a new age of cyber threats, reactive security is no longer viable.\nBusinesses must ensure that their networks are protected, maintained, and consistently patched to quell the rise of cyberattacks before they get worse. It\u2019s time businesses treat network security as a strategic and operational priority, not simply an exercise in compliance.\nWe list the best online cybersecurity courses.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

Plus, there's a password manager which auto-completes credit card details in web forms - although if you require more advanced features, you'll probably want the best password manager. It also scores high for its excellent anti-phishing module, which alerts you to malicious links in your search engine results and blocks access to dangerous sites.\nThat\u2019s not all: of course, there's also the multi-layer ransomware protection that heuristically learns the behavior of such threats to keep you safe as well as the ability to scan all your linked devices via the Bitdefender Central mobile app.\nThere are one or two issues \u2013 it grabs more resources than average, and might conflict with some programs \u2013 but Bitdefender Antivirus Plus is still a likeable package which offers excellent detection rates, great performance, and more than enough bonus features to justify the price.\nBitdefender Internet Security builds on AVP and triples the number of devices covered plus offers anti-spam, firewall, parental advisor and file encryption features.\nFor a little bit more you can purchase the Bitdefender Total Security edition.

The dashboard is user-friendly, there's protection not just from downloadable threats, but from dodgy links too, and you can use your mobile to scan your PC remotely, which is pretty clever.\nAlthough the free version offers basic antivirus protection, you really need to upgrade to the paid version to get the full-featured protection against ransomware, as well as additional security software protections such as data encryption options as well as a firewall.\nRead our full AVG Antivirus Free review.\nBest ransomware protection for multiple device protection\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAvast Antivirus is one of the most competent internet protection suites out there. While the company is famous for providing free antivirus software, it's worth noting that this now comes bundled with an anti-malware feature that uses behavioral monitoring to spot rogue programs.\nWhat's even better is that not only are Avast's basic products free, but they are also available for mobile devices as well as for desktops, which makes Avast a particular ideal choice if you have multiple devices you need to check.\nEven better is that ransomware protection is included in the free version of the Avast Antivirus platform, so you don't even need to pay to upgrade for this, though additional security features are available if you do.\nFor business users, there are paid-for internet security options to cover a range of needs and options.\nRead our full Avast Antivirus review.\nBest ransomware protection for a lightweight solution\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nJust about every antivirus tool claims to be \u2018lightweight\u2019, but Webroot Antivirus is really the only one to deliver on this front. Installation takes seconds, the program files barely use 2MB of your hard drive, RAM footprint is tiny, and there are no bulky signature updates to tie up your bandwidth.\nConsidering this, there's no compromise on features, which makes it all the more impressive. Along with the core protection, there's smart behavior monitoring, accurate real-time anti-phishing, a firewall and network connection monitor, enhanced anti-ransomware, and other interesting bonuses.\nIt's not easy to compare Webroot's accuracy with the competition, as the big testing labs rarely evaluate the company's products. However, when they are reviewed, they generally score high, and our own tests show solid and reliable protection.\nFeatures include always-on security, identity protection, real-time anti-phishing, firewall monitor.\nRead our full Webroot Antivirus review.\nFind the best deals on Webroot products with our Webroot promo codes.\nBest ransomware protection for experts\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you judge antivirus software on the length of its feature list, ESET NOD32 Antivirus might be a bit of a disappointment. There\u2019s no firewall, password manager, file shredder, vulnerability scanner or any of the bundled bonuses you'll often find in its rivals.\nThis doesn't mean the package is short on power, however. It's just more focused on the fundamentals. ESET NOD32 Antivirus comes with real-time malware protection, some of the best heuristic detection around, an anti-ransomware layer, exploit protection, URL filtering to block malicious websites, and modules to prevent attacks using PowerShell and malicious scripts.\nA Device Control module limits the risk of infection from other devices by controlling access to USB sticks, external hard drives, optical storage media, even devices connecting by Bluetooth and FireWire. It's an unusual addition, but could make a difference if others are regularly plugging devices into your PC.\nJust bear in mind that ESET NOD32 Antivirus isn't aimed at beginners. The interface is clumsy sometimes, some features are very advanced, and even the Help isn't always helpful.\nExperienced users will appreciate ESET\u2019s power and configurability, however. Above-average protection does a good job of keeping you safe, and a lightweight design ensures the package won't slow you down.\nESET Internet Security builds on NOD 32 and triples the number of devices covered plus offers firewall, botnet protection, webcam protection, antispam and more. Alternatively, you can purchase the ESET Smart Security Premium edition for not much more. It adds all of the above as well as password management and secure data.\nRead our full ESET NOD32 Antivirus review.\nBest ransomware removal software\nThe best malware removal software available right now is: Malwarebytes Premium\nIf you're suffering from a malware infection and free software isn't getting the job done, Malwarebytes Premium could be the silver bullet you need. It uses heuristic analysis to identify new strains of malware, cleans up existing infections, helps protect you from phishing scams, and helps stop you downloading further malicious software in the future, including ransomware.\nBest ransomware removal software overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you have a ransomware infection, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware should be your first port of call. It\u2019s updated daily, so you can trust it to identify and remove new threats the minute they appear.\nThe first time you install Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, you\u2019re given a 14-day trial of the premium edition, which includes preventative tools like real-time scanning and specific protection from ransomware. After two weeks, it reverts to the basic free version. This has to be activated manually, but is still a top-notch security tool. We recommend running it at least once a week to check or any nasties that you haven't noticed, or if you notice that your web browser has suddenly started acting strangely (likely a result of adware).\nRecently, Malwarebytes bought Adwcleaner, which \u2013 as its name suggests \u2013 targets and removes annoying programs that hijack your browser by changing your homepage, resetting your default search engine, or adding unwanted toolbars. It\u2019s also available free, and along with Anti-Malware, is a great addition to your security toolkit.\nRead our full Malwarebytes Anti-Malware review.\nBest free ransomware removal software\n2. Avast Free Ransomware Decryption Tools\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNot all ransomware encrypts data in the same way, so security software providers have to create specific solutions as new threats emerge. At the time of writing, the security experts at Avast have developed Free Ransomware Decryption Tools to tackle 21 different strains of file-locking ransomware.\nTo help you work out which one you need, Avast has provided a detailed description of how each form of ransomware works, what extension you\u2019ll see on the encrypted files, and an example of the type of message the virus creators have prepared for their victims.\nOnce you\u2019ve downloaded the appropriate tool, it will guide you through the process of wiping out the ransomware without paying the criminals. You\u2019ll need to provide two versions of the same file \u2013 an encrypted one, and the original.\nThis will be easiest if you made a backup before the infection, but Avast also suggests locations where you might be able to find unaffected original files. The tool will then compare the two and use the results to determine the password.\nWe've listed the best endpoint protection software.\nBest ransomware protection FAQs\nWhat is ransomware?\nAdam Kujawa, Director of Malwarebytes Labs:\n\u201cThe term malware, or \u2018malicious software,\u2019 is an umbrella term that describes any malicious program or code that is harmful to systems, including ransomware. Hostile, intrusive, and intentionally nasty, malware seeks to invade, damage, or disable computers, computer systems, networks, tablets, and mobile devices, often by taking partial control over a device\u2019s operations. Like the human flu, it interferes with normal functioning. The motives behind malware vary - it can be about making money off you, sabotaging your ability to get work done, making a political statement, or just bragging rights.\"\nHow to choose the best ransomware protection for you?\nWhen deciding which ransomware protection to use, first consider what your actual needs are, as budget software may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a more expensive platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, higher-end software can usually cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your ransomware protection.\nHow we test\nTo test for the best ransomware protection we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, then we tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each ransomware protection platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nWe've also rated the best identity management software.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?
