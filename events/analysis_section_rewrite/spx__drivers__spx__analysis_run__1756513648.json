      "feedback": "The draft is empty – it contains no substantive analysis, causal chain, or handle mapping. To meet the review criteria, rewrite the piece to include:\n\n1. **Explicit handle mapping** – e.g., “US 10‑year yield (ust10y) will rise 10–15 bp over the next 3 months.”  \n2. **Causal transmission path** – explain how Fed policy tightening (fed_policy) pushes yields up, compresses spreads, and lifts the S&P 500 (spx) by 0.1–0.2 %.  \n3. **Catalyst window** – specify a dated range (e.g., “Fed policy meeting on 2025‑09‑15” or “Q3 earnings season, 2025‑10‑01 to 2025‑10‑15”).  \n4. **Quantified direction/magnitude** – use concrete ranges (bp, %), horizon, and mention fragility (e.g., “if the Fed signals a pause, yields could stall”).  \n5. **Inline citations** – attach IDs from the source material (e.g., (H86O3XRUJ)) for every claim.  \n6. **Avoid generic platitudes** – replace vague statements with data‑driven insights.  \n\nEnsure the revised paragraph is concise, follows the “action over prose” style, and satisfies both acceptance gates.",
