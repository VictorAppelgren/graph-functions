  "content": "Robert Keele said this week that he has stepped down as xAI\u2019s head of legal after just over a year, saying he wants to spend more time with his children. In his announcement, Keele also acknowledged \u201cdaylight between our worldviews\u201d with boss Elon Musk, who hasn\u2019t commented on Keele\u2019s exit.\n\n\u201cI love my two toddlers and I don\u2019t get to see them enough,\u201d Keele wrote, posting the news on both X and LinkedIn. Despite calling his time at the AI startup \u201cincredible\u201d and working with Musk \u201cthe adventure of a lifetime,\u201d he said he couldn\u2019t keep \u201criding two horses at once \u2014 the family and the job.\u201d\n\nKeele\u2019s news prompted an outpouring of support on social media from xAI colleagues as well as parents. When he joined xAI in May 2024 as its first legal head, he had just launched his own, very short-lived fractional legal outfit. \u201cKeele Law had a good run (~3 weeks!), but I couldn\u2019t pass up an opportunity to run legal at xAI,\u201d he wrote at the time, calling himself \u201cbeyond stoked, and insanely lucky.\u201d\n\nKeele arrived just before xAI announced a massive $6 billion Series B funding round in May 2024, backed by heavy hitters like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, valuing the company at $24 billion. Soon after, xAI began experiencing rapid growth and, in March of this year, acquired X, Musk\u2019s social media company, in a deal that, said Musk at the time, valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion.\n\nBefore his entrepreneurial stint, Keele had been head of legal at autonomous aircraft maker Elroy Air and general counsel at Airbus\u2019s Silicon Valley innovation center.\n\nTaking over is Lily Lim, who, before becoming a lawyer, was a rocket scientist at NASA, working on spacecraft navigation for the project that mapped Venus\u2019s surface. She joined xAI in late 2024 as a privacy and IP specialist after legal stints at numerous firms and companies like ServiceNow.\n\nKeele\u2019s departure fits an ongoing pattern of executive turnover across Musk\u2019s empire. X CEO Linda Yaccarino left last month, and Tesla has lost several top executives recently. Musk \u2014 who also has numerous longstanding lieutenants \u2014 openly expects employees to work long hours, even if it means sleeping at the office, as happened when he acquired X, formerly Twitter.\n\nSome newer companies appear to have adopted a similar mentality to get ahead of rivals, including AI coding startup Cognition, which is looking to aggressively shrink its team. In fact, its CEO recently told employees in an email that he doesn\u2019t believe in work-life balance.",

The report said workers fear they could lose their jobs if they\u2019re unable to complete the project by the end of the week.\nMusk infamously slept on the factory floor as Tesla initially struggled to meet its production targets.\nCrawford followed up on the photo with a series of tweets after the post drew some alarmed responses on social media.\n\u201cSince some people are losing their minds I\u2019ll explain: doing hard things requires sacrifice (time, energy, etc),\u201d Crawford said. \u201cI have teammates around the world who are putting in the effort to bring something new to life so it\u2019s important to me to show up for them & keep the team unblocked.\u201d\n\u201cI work with amazingly talented & ambitious people here at Twitter and this is not a normal moment in time,\u201d Crawford continued. \u201cWe are less than 1wk into a massive business & cultural transition. People are giving it their all across all functions: product, design, eng, legal, finance, marketing, etc.\u201d\n\u201cWe are #OneTeam and we use the hashtag #LoveWhereYouWork to show it, which is why I retweeted with #SleepWhereYouWork \u2014 a cheeky nod to fellow Tweeps. We\u2019ve been in the midst of a crazy public acquisition for months but we keep going & I\u2019m so proud of our strength & resilience,\u201d she added.\nThe Information reported this week that Crawford \u201cappears to be rising in prominence\u201d at Twitter since Musk took over the company.\nTwitter, Crawford and Jones did not immediately return requests for comment.\nThe photo drew a series of sharp responses on Twitter from users who felt sleeping on the office floor was excessive.\n\u201cA manager who values you or your skills won\u2019t make you #SleepWhereYouWork to keep your job,\u201d TechCrunch editorial manager Walter Thompson replied.\n\u201cWhen you take pride in a glaring failure of management,\u201d one user wrote."

Her departure also comes on the same day that Musk is supposed to reveal Grok 4.\nYaccarino joined the company just months into Musk\u2019s ownership, leaving her longtime role as chairwoman of global advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal.\nGiven her stature as an advertising executive, Yaccarino was brought in as X CEO to maintain relationships with advertisers amid a massive shift in platform leadership when Musk bought Twitter.\nHer job was not easy. Within the first six months of her tenure, Musk used his personal X account to endorse the antisemitic \u201cgreat replacement\u201d conspiracy, as well as other debunked conspiracy theories like Pizzagate. He went on to sue nonprofit research groups like Center for Countering Digital Hate and Media Matters, which published a report that highlighted X\u2019s display of extremist content beside advertisements for companies like IBM and Apple, leading them and other major advertisers to depart the platform.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Onstage at the DealBook conference in November 2023, Musk was asked about these pauses in advertising, to which he replied, \u201cGo f\u2014 yourself,\u201d then waved to the audience and said \u201cHey, Bob,\u201d referring to Disney CEO Bob Iger, who was in attendance.\nMusk apologized for these remarks, and Yaccarino stood by him.\n\u201cX is enabling an information independence that\u2019s uncomfortable for some people,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re a platform that allows people to make their own decisions. And here\u2019s my perspective when it comes to advertising: X is standing at a unique and amazing intersection of Free Speech and Main Street \u2014 and the X community is powerful and is here to welcome you.\u201d"

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.

      "text": "Cognition, the AI coding startup that acquired rival company Windsurf three weeks ago, laid off 30 employees last week and is offering buyouts to the roughly 200 remaining employees on the team, reports The Information.\nThis is the latest bout of whiplash that Windsurf employees have faced after a tumultuous stretch for the company. The startup was initially almost acquired by OpenAI, then lost its CEO, co-founder, and research leads to Google in a $2.4 billion deal known as a reverse-acquihire (where Google hired the key talent rather than buying the company), before ultimately getting acquired by Cognition.\nAt the time of the acquisition, Cognition stated that 100% of Windsurf employees would receive financial compensation as part of the deal and stressed that the company was excited to bring on Windsurf\u2019s \u201cworld-class people\u201d to develop top-notch coding tools.\nNow, it\u2019s becoming clear that Windsurf\u2019s intellectual property, not its talent, was the real buy.\nAccording to an email The Information viewed, employees were given until August 10 to decide whether they want to take the buyout, which amounts to nine months of salary. Those who choose to stay are reportedly required to spend six days at the office and clock more than 80-hour weeks \u2014 draconian conditions that have become table stakes among workers at top AI firms.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe in work-life balance\u2014building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn\u2019t possibly separate the two,\u201d wrote Cognition CEO Scott Wu in the email.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Cognition for more details.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

His departure follows a trend of executive turnover within Musk's companies, including the recent exit of X CEO Linda Yaccarino. Keele's role will be taken over by Lily Lim, a former NASA rocket scientist, as xAI continues to grow rapidly after significant funding and acquisitions.",
