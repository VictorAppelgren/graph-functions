  "title": "D.C. is not what the president thinks it is",
  "description": "Readers respond to Trump\u2019s attacks on D.C., Confederate memorials and statues returning, and other local issues",
  "content": "To his point on crime, U.S. News and World Report recently compiled a list of the 25 cities with the worst stats for property crimes and murder, per 100,000 people, using FBI crime reports. Given those numbers, perhaps Trump should try to take over Memphis (No. 1); Cleveland (No. 7); Kansas City, Missouri; (No. 20); or Milwaukee (No. 24)? D.C. didn\u2019t even crack the list.\n\nOf course, we know what\u2019s different. Congress (not the president) does have a special legal relationship with the District. But Congress also understood about 50 years ago that it could not and should not run the city, thus gradually giving over the authority to do so to an elected mayor and council that represent the city\u2019s 700,000 residents.\n\nThe bottom line is that there are many cities with similar problems to D.C., and at least 25 others have worse crime issues than the capital. Should Congress help D.C. by investing in it? Sure. But the president should stick to his job, while the D.C. mayor and council stick to theirs. Congress should pay more attention to the authority it keeps relinquishing to the president than to the running of a complicated city \u2014 one in which many of its members do not even reside, let alone possess the understanding, democratic legitimacy or expertise to \u201cfix.\u201d\n\nAs I\u2019m retired, I have the luxury of having a lot of free time. Weather permitting, I love taking the Metro into D.C. and then walking around. I usually have no plan, and I often don\u2019t know at which station I\u2019ll get off. There are so many vibrant neighborhoods, warm and friendly people, magnificent churches, and beautiful parks. The city is vibrant, safe and incredibly clean.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth proposed on Aug. 5 to return to Arlington National Cemetery in 2027 Moses Ezekiel\u2019s metal paeon to the Confederacy often referred to as \u2014 with spectacular hypocrisy \u2014 \u201cThe Reconciliation Monument.\u201d Returning this glorification of enslavement and treason to Arlington would be a desecration of the final resting place of hundreds of thousands of loyal Americans who stepped forward to defend our nation. They include my late wife, who was an Army Reserve lieutenant colonel.\n\nHowever, there is another exhibit from the museum\u2019s earliest days that I wish it would bring back. When it opened in 1976, the museum had a gallery featuring Charles and Ray Eames\u2019s nine-minute film \u201cPowers of Ten.\u201d The film, with Elmer Bernstein\u2019s quirky score, took the viewer on a journey that began with an aerial view of a man lying asleep on the ground. As the viewer moved away, the frame of view expanded by a power of 10 every 10 seconds. City blocks, continents, Earth, the solar system, stars and galaxies successively appeared and disappeared, until the viewer reached the outmost-known limits of the universe. Then the journey reversed, as the viewer returned to the person, then plunged into the microscopic world at the same exponential rate. The journey concluded in the nucleus of a carbon atom in the DNA of a cell in the sleeping man\u2019s hand.\n\nPresident Donald Trump recently reestablished the presidential fitness test, which ran from the late 1950s to 2013. Do you remember taking the test? Did it help you lead an active lifestyle into adulthood? What are your thoughts on its reimplementation? Share your response, and it might be published as a letter to the editor: wapo.st/fitness-test",

      "text": "2025 Topps Series One Dylan Crews and James Wood Updates\nMuch has been made of Dylan Crews and James Wood, the pair of highly-touted prospects the Washington Nationals hope will bring the organization back to the top of the National League. We took a look at the array of intriguing rookie cards from both Crews and Wood shortly after the release of 2025 Topps Baseball Series 1. Now that the regular season is just a couple of weeks away, let's take the chance to check in on these top prospects, how they've fared so far, and how their card markets are holding up.\nRELATED: 2025 Topps Baseball Series 1: Dylan Crews Rookie Cards Arrive\nDylan Crews has appeared in 13 Spring Training games at writing, batting an impressive .306 to go along with an OBP of .419. 11 hits, 4 RBI, 3 SB, and 7 BB. While Crews has shown the ability to hit to all fields, there has been a lack of power that would have to go down as the primary concern so far. Crews is slugging only .361, with an OPS of .780. He still projects to be a phenomenal defensive player, but the power at the plate does not seem to have made real strides as of yet.\nRELATED: 2025 Topps Baseball Series 1: James Wood Rookie Cards Are Here\nLuckily for Washington, they have two bites at the phenom cherry, and if it's power you're looking for in the nation's capital this year, James Wood looks like he can provide it. In 10 Spring Training games, Wood has launched 4 homers, to go with 9 RBI. Batting average? .379. OBP? .455. OPS? 1.386. The young slugger leads the Nationals in home runs, RBI and OPS so far this spring. Wood has shown power to all fields, including launching a 3-run homer to opposite field last Thursday. With these two prospects showing poise and production, along with 2024 All-Star shortstop CJ Abrams, it's clear that the future at the top of the order in Washington is bright.\nUnsurprisingly, these two prospects remain the most valuable in early 2025 Topps Baseball Series 1 trading. Both have multiple four-figure sales on the secondary market. At writing, Wood's top sale is $1,721 for his Flagship Real One Auto /10. More recently, a March 8 sale of a Wood Topps Baseball Series 1 Auto /10 sold for $1,426. Wood's 1/1 1990 Topps Baseball Auto has been pulled, and is currently listed on Ebay for $3,500. Wood 2025 Topps Series 1 autos are currently listed on Ebay priced $20 and up.\nDylan Crews has the top 2025 Topps Baseball Series 1 rookie card sale listed on Card Ladder at writing. A 1990 Topps Baseball Auto /5 sold for $1,899 on February 24. A recent March 13 sale of a Major League Materials Auto Relic 1/1 sold for $1,700. The lowest-price Crews 2025 Series 1 auto currently listed on Ebay is $10.27, but from there, autos are listed for $25 and up.\nThere have also been a couple of big sales of earlier Crews and Wood cards of late. March 16 saw the sale of a 2024 Bowman Chrome Prospect Autographs Gold Refractor RC /50 PSA 10 for $3,179. A /25 auto orange refractor of the same card sold for $4,835 in late February. As to Wood, since March 15 alone, there have been four sales of his 2022 Bowman cards ranging from $2,250 - $5,150. The top sale of $5,150 was on March 16, for Wood's 2022 Bowman Chrome Orange Refractor Auto /25.\nRELATED: James Wood & Dylan Crews' 2025 Topps Series One 1/1 Dual Patch Auto pulled\nCrews/Wood dual autos can also be found in 2025 Topps Series 1, and have fetched four-figures on three separate occasions per Card Ladder. The top sale of a Crews/Wood dual auto is, at writing, is $1,383 for a Major League Materials Dual Auto Relic /25.\nCrews will open the season as the second-favorite to take home NL ROY honors, and it seems like there's every possibility that Wood could put up very impressive power numbers in his first full season. The market for these two rookies has been solid, and their Spring Training performance has only helped."

      "text": "Ten U.S. Army bases are still named in honor of Confederate generals. Donald Trump has strenuously resisted any effort to rename these bases, saying that they are \u201cpart of a great American heritage.\u201d But what heritage are they commemorating exactly?\nNaming these bases was one of the crowning achievements of those who sought to perpetuate the Lost Cause. A revisionist history that gained popularity in the 1890s, the Lost Cause recast the Confederacy\u2019s humiliating defeat in a treasonous war for slavery as the embodiment of the Framers\u2019 true vision for America. Supporters pushed the ideas that the Civil War was not actually about slavery; that Robert E. Lee was a brilliant general, gentleman, and patriot; and that the Ku Klux Klan had rescued the heritage of the old South, what came to be known as \u201cthe southern way of life.\u201d\nA principal goal of the Lost Cause was to reintegrate Confederate soldiers into the honorable traditions of the very American military they had once fought against. Members of the Lost Cause movement had lobbied to have newly built military bases named after Confederate generals several times without success. But during Woodrow Wilson\u2019s second term as president, they found a more hospitable reception. Thanks to Wilson, the Lost Cause ideology came fully into the mainstream, reaching the apex of its influence as America entered the First World War.\nBorn and raised in Virginia, Wilson was the first American president to hail from the South since the Civil War. He was 8 years old when Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House. Though Wilson grew up to become a northeastern Ivy League academic, the president of Princeton, and later governor of New Jersey, his southern political base saw him as a champion of the Lost Cause. And he didn\u2019t let them down.\nAs president, Wilson imposed Jim Crow\u2013style segregation on the federal civil service and the Navy, which had been integrated for the previous century, and when he hosted the first-ever screening of a feature film in the White House, the honor went to The Birth of a Nation. An adaptation of the Thomas Dixon Jr. novel The Clansman, the film brought the myth of the Lost Cause to the silver screen in a racist paean to the defeat of Reconstruction through the terrorist violence of the KKK.\nIn 1916, Wilson narrowly won reelection. Most political historians attribute his success to his promise of isolationism\u2014his slogans were \u201cAmerica First\u201d and \u201cHe kept us out of war\u201d\u2014as Europe burned itself to the ground in what was then called the Great War. Within a few months of his reelection, though, following a renewed wave of German belligerence, Wilson mobilized the nation for war.\nWhile the Great War was more politically popular than it had been just months before, the United States simply did not have a military capable of fighting in it. The National Guard and Army totaled little more than a quarter-million men combined. Needing to build an army quickly, Congress enacted the first federal draft since the Civil War. On June 5, 1917, every American man from the ages of 21 to 31 was legally obliged to register for conscription, with the expectation that 2 million of them would be imminently called to serve.\nIncreasing the size of the Army tenfold created a massive logistical problem. Where could so many men train before shipping off to Europe?\nThe solution was to quickly build 32 new encampments\u2014now called bases\u2014distributed over 14 states. Sixteen were to be located in the South, a decision justified on the grounds that the warmer climate would allow for year-round training outdoors. But the choice of the South was a sensitive political matter, and not only because it had believed in Wilson\u2019s campaign promises of \u201cAmerica First\u201d isolationism.\nOnly 40 years earlier, President Rutherford B. Hayes had withdrawn the Army from the former Confederate states, marking the end of Reconstruction and the return of white supremacy under the guise of Redemption. In 1878, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act to forbid the deployment of the Army to assist in law enforcement, which really meant federal civil-rights-law enforcement. Ever since, the Army had maintained a light footprint below the Mason-Dixon line.\nReestablishing a large Army presence in the former Confederate states risked touching a still-raw historical nerve. But Wilson was the Lost Cause president, and he put that mythology to full use to bolster support for the war effort. During the first week of June 1917, the United Confederate Veterans hosted their 27th reunion, in Washington, D.C., the first such reunion outside the former states of the Confederacy. Nearly 100 Confederate soldiers were welcomed into the Capitol building, where they held a mock session of the Senate. And a parade of Confederate veterans, dressed in gray uniform jackets and waving the Stars and Bars, marched down Pennsylvania Avenue to the tune of \u201cDixie\u201d as Wilson welcomed them from the grandstand.\nA Sons of Confederate Veterans newsletter described the scene as \u201cthe men who made history half a century ago saluted the man who is making history to-day and who stands for the principles for which they gave their lives.\u201d At Arlington National Cemetery, Wilson and the first lady appeared for a solemn commemoration held in the shadow of the Confederate Memorial\u2014a landmark that the United Daughters of the Confederacy had fought for and built in 1914. An honor roll of Confederate veterans was read, religious songs were sung, and, as one local paper reported, \u201cthousands crowded the grounds and heard the eulogies pronounced on those who died for the Lost Cause.\u201d\nThe main event was a celebration at Washington\u2019s Arcade Auditorium, where thousands came to hear their president speak. Wilson sat as the guest of honor on a dais flanked by American and Confederate battle flags. His address was a full-throated embrace of the Lost Cause: \u201cThere are many memories of the Civil War that thrill along the blood and make one proud to have been sprung of a race that could produce such bravery and constancy.\u201d To a standing ovation of applause and rebel yells, Wilson warmly recalled how \u201cheroic things were done on both sides.\u201d\nWith the deadline to register for the draft that very day, Colonel Robert E. Lee, a grandson of the Confederate general, took his turn at the podium. Lee assured the president that the sons of the South could be relied on to \u201cforget all local animosities\u201d and mobilize to fight in the Great War just as they had for the Confederacy.\nWhen it came time to name the new Army bases, just a month later, Brigadier General Joseph E. Kuhn, who was tasked with setting up the camps and leading a naming committee, followed Wilson\u2019s lead. In announcing the plan for the bases, Kuhn said that every \u201ceffort has been made to select names of federal commanders for camps of divisions from northern states and of Confederate commanders for camps of divisions from southern states.\u201d Among them were Camp Beauregard, Fort Gordon, and Fort Lee.\nThe cover of the August issue of the magazine Confederate Veteran crowed that \u201cfor the first time since the War between the States, the United States government officially paid a tribute to the military genius of noted Confederate war chieftains in naming four of the training camps, where the selective draft army and national guardsmen will be prepared for service in France.\u201d\nThe peculiarity of naming Army bases after Confederate generals did not go unnoticed at the time. A pointed op-ed in The Cleveland Gazette lamented, \u201cSince 1861 to 1865, the South has won back all that it lost in that memorable struggle except its slaves.\u201d And The Boston Globe reported the announcement of the new bases with a raised eyebrow: \u201cIn the list of names announced tonight, Lee, Gordon, Beauregard, and Wheeler take their places beside Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Meade and more than a score of others who fought for the Union.\u201d\nThe Lost Cause had won. Fort Bragg and Fort Benning were established the following year. Then, in the mobilization for the Second World War, new Army bases built in the states of the former Confederacy were christened with the names of Confederate generals\u2014including Fort A. P. Hill, Fort Hood, Fort Pickett, Fort Polk, and Fort Rucker.\nTrump is correct when he says that the names of the 10 Army bases that honor Confederates are a question of heritage. But is that a heritage the Army should be commemorating? After Kuhn\u2019s plan was adopted, Confederate Veteran published an essay titled \u201cWhy Did the Confederate States Fight?\u201d Its conclusion was that the war was not about slavery. Instead, \u201cevery Confederate soldier, however poor in worldly goods, cherished in every fiber of his nature this sense of race superiority as his patent of nobility, and instinctively he felt that he was fighting to maintain that superiority against a party intent on making the negro his equal. He cared nothing for slavery, but he fought for his own race standing.\u201d\nThe premise of the Lost Cause was that this worldview was as worthy as the proposition that all men were created equal. Continuing to commemorate that cause, most especially within the institution of the military, is an act of political neutrality on the question of white supremacy. It insists, to borrow Wilson\u2019s (and later Trump\u2019s) phrase, that equal respect is owed to both sides."
