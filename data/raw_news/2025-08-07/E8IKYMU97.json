  "content": "How Long Do DeWalt Tools Last? Here's How Long The Warranty Is Good For\n\nNo matter how they're used, power tools are an investment. They're expensive in most cases, and you want to get as much use time out of them as possible as a result. Fortunately, there are plenty of strong, reliable power tool brands on the market, making it easy to choose one you can count on. Many customers would agree that longtime power tool giant DeWalt is one such brand, offering a wide assortment of tools and batteries. In fact, some non-DeWalt tools can even use DeWalt batteries, proving how versatile the company's offerings can be. Still, that's not to say these tools are invincible. Over time, DeWalt tools will wear out and will have to be repaired or replaced. If you're looking to give the brand a shot, what can you expect in terms of longevity? Overall, you should expect to get multiple years out of your average DeWalt tool, but this isn't a guarantee. At the end of the day, there are several factors that can and will impact the lifespan of your tools. Which tool is being discussed, how often and how hard they're used, how they're stored, and how they're handled can all influence how many use hours a DeWalt tool can give you. Digging a bit deeper, though, the brand does hint at roughly how long its tools should last. DeWalt tools tend to come with a warranty of some kind. Looking into these and how long they apply, we can get an idea of how long the company anticipates its tools will last before needing to be fixed or replaced.\n\nConveniently for DeWalt buyers, the company has several warranty options available, including a three-year limited warranty and a limited lifetime warranty. Though these are all options for different tools and situations, the bulk of DeWalt power tools come with the three-year limited warranty. Therefore, it's no stretch to assume that around three years is the average lifespan DeWalt anticipates most of its tools to see out. It should be noted, of course, that your tools may survive much longer than the intended warranty, though. Ideally, this warranty \u2014 one of DeWalt's several warranties that compare to those of Milwaukee and other brands \u2014 will prove enough to get a worn-down tool repaired, but DeWalt is specific about where it applies. The terms of the warranty state that the company will repair, without any charge to you, any defects due to faulty materials or workmanship for three years from the date the tool was purchased, or the date it was delivered to the buyer. Any damage the brand deems beyond these specifics means the warranty will not be honored. If you are hoping to get a tool replaced once it runs down, that's where the one-year free service contract comes in. This will allow replacement of the tool for free on the same terms within one year.\n\nGetting the most time out of your DeWalt tools It doesn't hurt to take the steps to extend the life of your tools as long as possible. One of the biggest elements to all this is work habits. The last thing you want is to overwork your tools, which harms the internal components and eventually causes failure. Take breaks while on the job, and if your tool runs hot, give it time to cool down and try to avoid bringing it to that level again. During said break, make sure they're not in a position to fall or have things dropped on them. It goes without saying that this can lead to serious damage. As for when they're not in use, make sure your tools are clean. Dirt, sawdust, and more can make their way inside the tool, constricting cooling air flow and potentially harming sensitive parts within. Wiping them down with a clean cloth and using compressed air to remove debris from nooks and crannies should serve you just fine. Once they're cleaned, you want your DeWalt tools stored in an ideal environment. This should be somewhere that is consistently cool and dry, and if you're able, somewhere your tools are sealed away. This way, any unexpected moisture, dirt, and dust don't make their way to your tools. Whether you're an experienced tool user or someone looking for beginner DeWalt tools, getting the most from these investments is crucial. So long as you're smart with your power tools, there's no reason why you shouldn't get years of use out of them.",
