  "content": "Need a gaming laptop upgrade? If you're looking for lots of power and longevity, I'd recommend getting one of the latest graphics cards with it. Thankfully, you can get just that with this Gigabyte Aero X16 Gaming Laptop at Best Buy for $1,299.99 (was $1,649.99).\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card belongs to its latest series and it is known for its excellent performance, which means it isn't cheap. However, this is one of the lowest prices I\u2019ve seen for an RTX 5070 gaming laptop that isn't weighed down by compromises like low RAM or storage, so it's something I'd at least consider getting if you want a powerful gaming laptop right now.\n\nThe Gigabyte Aero X16\u2019s biggest draw is its value for the price with the RTX 5070 graphics card, 32GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD for under $1,300. It also comes with a AMD Ryzen 7 AI 350 processor, which launched earlier this year, just like the RTX 50 series. The Aero X16's powerful processors help seamlessly support AI-friendly features like Gigabyte's GiMATE smart AI and Copilot, too.\n\nGigabyte is a Taiwanese company known for PC hardware, including motherboards, gaming PCs and laptops. We've reviewed a few Gigabyte laptops in the past, such as the Gigabyte Aero 14 and Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG, and were generally impressed with what we saw \u2013 even though better battery life would've been appreciated.\n\nIf you're not completely sold, I get it. I'd recommend comparing with our best Labor Day laptop deals and best gaming laptops.",

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG might be one of the best values in gaming laptops that I\u2019ve seen recently, as it offers great performance and internals for a very, very good price. Of course, it comes with some serious compromises such as a weak battery life, loud fans, and a display that, while blazing fast, has fairly poor color coverage.\nPros\n- +\nVery good price for what you get\n- +\nSleek, minimalist slightly-gaming centric design\n- +\nVery solid performance\nCons\n- -\nFans get fairly loud\n- -\nColor coverage and accuracy not great\n- -\nWeak battery life\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nGigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG: One-minute review\nBefore I got my hands on the Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG, I thought I was done being surprised by how good the best budget gaming laptops have become. And I absolutely slot this model in that category.\nHowever, the value on this model sporting an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 is very impressive, especially considering that much of the competition priced similarly seems to sport the slightly weaker 4050 GPU, which is still fairly powerful.\nIn fact, these 4050 and 4060-equipped laptops can handle most gaming duties so the current difference between the best gaming laptops out there is not that huge unless you want to hook up a giant monitor or want something with a 4K OLED screen or something else that\u2019s a QoL upgrade, but not all that necessary for something that\u2019s going to be sitting two feet from your face. That said, we might start to see more pronounced performance differences when newer games take advantage of the power this generation of GPUs can provide.\nLooking beyond the value here as well as the power of the current-gen GPUs, the Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG is a smart-looking laptop that looks like a gaming laptop without being in your face about it. It also comes with some AI functionalities that, while interesting, are enough in their infancy that they don\u2019t make a noticeably huge impact on the experience.\nSince it is a budget laptop, there are some sacrifices. Even though the display has a fast refresh rate, the colors aren\u2019t that great (so no editing on this). And, the battery life is pretty weak. But, if you\u2019re a gamer on a budget, you probably won\u2019t care and you probably shouldn\u2019t.\nGigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG: Price & availability\n- How much does it cost? Starting at $1,249.00 / \u00a3998.31 / AU$1,899.00\n- When is it available? Available now\n- Where can you get it? Available in the US, UK and Australia\nThe Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG might just redefine value for gaming laptops. Or, maybe not. Regardless, it\u2019s a damn good deal as you get a 14th-gen i7 CPU and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU, along with 16GB of RAM, for $1,249.00 / \u00a3998.31 / AU$1,899.00.\nAnd, if you\u2019re in Australia, you can find an even cheaper related version, known as the G6X 9MG, that is mostly differentiated by the fact that it boasts a less-powerful 4050 GPU for AU$1,699.00.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nNow, Gigabyte is not alone in this mid-range performance meets budget pricing (well, budget for gaming) category but is one of the best values. The Acer Nitro 16 AMD I reviewed earlier this year, provides some very good 1080p performance and goes for a similar $1,199.99 / AU$2,099.99 (about \u00a3945) price tag. Of course, it comes with that less powerful 4050 GPU.\nAnother good comparison is the Lenovo LOQ 15 (AMD), which goes for $1,379.99 / \u00a31,300 (about AU$2,162), when you get the AMD Ryzen 7 CPU and 4060 GPU. As much as I like Lenovo\u2019s designs and found their pricing to be good, the Gigabyte still offers better pound-for-pound value, especially since you can get a version with 32GB and 2TB of storage for just slightly more at $1,499.00 / AU$2,157.00.\n- Value: 5 / 5\nGigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG: Specs\nIf you don\u2019t count the slightly cheaper G6X 9MG, which comes with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU, the only real variation in configuration comes in how much RAM and storage space you order, ranging from 16GB to 32GB and 1 to 2TB.\nOf course, this laptop\u2019s RAM slots and M.2 SSD slots are easily swappable so you can upgrade to 64GB and some retailers in Australia offer upgrades during purchase to both the RAM and storage.\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG review configuration | Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG max configuration |\n|---|---|---|\n| Price: | $1,249.00 / \u00a3998.31 / AU$1,899.00 | $1,499.00 / AU$2,157.00 |\n| CPU: | Intel Core i7-13650HX | Intel Core i7-13650HX |\n| Graphics: | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU |\n| RAM: | 16 GB DDR5 | 32 GB DDR5 |\n| Screen: | 16.0\" 16:10 WUXGA (1920 x 1200) 165Hz FHD | 16.0\" 16:10 WUXGA (1920 x 1200) 165Hz FHD |\n| Storage: | 1 TB SSD | 2 TB SSD |\n| Ports: | 2x USB-C, 2x USB-A, HDMI 2.1, RJ-45 Ethernet, Audio jack | 2x USB-C, 2x USB-A, HDMI 2.1, RJ-45 Ethernet, Audio jack |\n| Wireless: | Bluetooth, WiFi 6E 802.11ax | Bluetooth, WiFi 6E 802.11ax |\n| Camera: | 720p webcam | 720p webcam |\n| Weight: | 8.7 pounds | 8.7 pounds |\n| Dimensions: | 14.21 x 10.2 x 1.13 inches | 14.21 x 10.2 x 1.13 inches |\nBeyond that, there\u2019s only one choice when it comes to the screen, which is a 16:10 16-inch panel with a 1920 x 1200p resolution (essentially 1080p but in that 16:10 aspect ratio) and speedy 165Hz refresh rate.\nGigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG: Design\n- Sleek, subdued gaming design\n- Decent keyboard and mouse\n- Thermals are pretty good except underneath\nPhysically, the Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG is fairly smart looking. Its all-black colorway with some subtle gray designs on the lid and body\u2019s top plate, both of which are aluminum, are the main indicators that this is a gaming laptop.\nOtherwise, it\u2019s a somewhat subdued, almost minimalist look that won\u2019t rat you out if you pull it out at a cafe to work on (though once we get to battery life, you might think twice about doing this anyway).\nThe panel is basically a 1080p one but in a 16:10 aspect ratio (1920 x 1200p) and runs at a blazing-fast 165Hz refresh rate. It also provides a decent amount of screen space as this is a 16-inch laptop.\nSince there is plenty of space, the keyboard is a full-sized one, complete with a separate numpad. There are plenty of hotkeys for different shortcuts as well as a dedicated key to pull up Window\u2019s new AI Copilot.\nSince this is a gaming laptop, there\u2019s also RGB backlighting. Unfortunately, it\u2019s as basic as it comes as you can just pick one color for the whole thing. At least you can create macros for the keyboard, which is pretty cool. More importantly, typing on the keyboard is a nice experience, if nothing special.\nThe touchpad works well and is fairly sizable. The only minor complaint is its center-left placement \u2013 something that\u2019s not unique here but that I never quite understood. Of course, that\u2019s me being nit-picky, not to mention the fact that you\u2019ll still need to use an external mouse for any gaming you do.\nAs far as ports go, the selection is decent with two USB-C and two USB-A along with an HDMI 2.1 port so you can keep a fast refresh rate with an external monitor. My only issue is that some of the ports are on the back \u2013 a design choice I\u2019ve always disliked when I come across it.\nWhen it comes to thermals, there\u2019s a lot going on internally from heat piping and thermal intakes and outtakes to the two fans that get pretty loud whenever the laptop is under duress. While those fans can get distracting if you\u2019re not using headphones, there aren\u2019t too many issues with heat as long as you\u2019re not touching the bottom of the laptop.\n- Design: 4 / 5\nGigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG: Performance\n- Very solid gaming performance\n- Screen is not the best for colors\n- Audio is not bad for a laptop\nHere is how the Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG performed in our suite of benchmark tests:\n3DMark Speed Way: 2,422; Fire Strike: 25,197; Time Spy: 10,228\nGeekBench 6.3: 2,596 (single-core); 14,287 (multi-core)\n25GB File Copy: 19.1 seconds\nHandbrake 1.6.1: 4:40 Minutes\nCrossMark: Overall: 1,996 Productivity: 1,894 Creativity: 2,114 Responsiveness: 1,966\nF1 23 1080p (Ultra) 39 fps\nCyberpunk 2077: 1080p (Ultra) 32.13 fps\nWeb Surfing (Battery Informant): 3:43:53 hours\nPCMark 10 Battery Life (Gaming): 1:11 hours\nI was duly impressed with the performance on the Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG. And if you\u2019re okay adjusting some settings or taking some slight performance hits, you\u2019ll be very happy with what this laptop can do.\nPowered by a 14th-gen i7 \u2013 specifically, one of the new HX chips with AI capabilities \u2013 and a Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 (and 32GB of RAM for the test unit), I never felt inhibited by the hardware, whether I was playing Hogwarts Legacy, Cyberpunk 2077, or Battlefield 2042. Now, the hardware included is meant to power that 1920x1200p screen at 165Hz and it certainly does.\nWhile I mentioned earlier that I feel there\u2019s not a huge difference performance-wise between a laptop like this and something sporting more powerful internals, you are going to have to adjust settings a little bit, particularly on the ray-tracing front. As you can see with the benchmarks below, it\u2019s not going to touch something like the Acer Predator Helios 18 and its Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080.\nWhether it\u2019s from some of the backend AI functions closing the gap, my actual subjective experience, as opposed to just looking at the number, felt like I wasn\u2019t missing anything. Sure, there was some texture popping here and there or light screen tearing, especially when the POV has moved around quickly, but anyone who\u2019s limited by their budget is not going to be frustrated with the experience here.\nOn top of that, the screen looks good enough. However, you\u2019re not going to be able to leverage that under-the-hood power for video or photo-editing. At least not if you want accurate results. The sRGB coverage is 67% while the DCI-P3 is 48. This also means that games aren\u2019t going to pop with as much vibrancy as with some other laptops. Also, there\u2019s no HDR on hand.\nRegarding sound, Gigabyte advertises this laptop to simulate a 5.1.2 system using Dolby Atmos. While you still end up with that somewhat boxy audio that almost all laptops seem to end up with, there is a little more of a soundstage and a tiny bit more space to what I hear when playing, say, Cyberpunk 2077, thanks to the virtual spatial audio.\n- Performance: 4 / 5\nGigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG: Battery life\n- Not very good battery life\n- Charging is okay\nWe\u2019ve seen some gaming laptops start to break the mold in terms of battery life. That\u2019s not the case here. The battery life is, to speak plainly, not very good. Yes, this is the case for a lot of gaming laptops still, but you still get under four hours of regular use per our web surfing benchmark and just a little over an hour of gaming per the PC Mark 10 battery life benchmark.\nIf you do have to use the Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG untethered, charging it back up is not going to be a speedy affair. It\u2019s not slow necessarily as you\u2019ll get 10% more battery every ten minutes or so, but this is not fast charging.\n- Battery Life: 3 / 5\nShould you buy the Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG?\n| Value | This might be one of the best values in gaming laptops right now. | 5 / 5 |\n| Design | A sleek look, a full keyboard and fairly good thermals make for an attractive gaming laptop proposition. | 4 / 5 |\n| Performance | There might be some compromises, but you\u2019ll be able to play just about anything on here. Just don\u2019t expect the most vibrant screen. | 4 / 5 |\n| Battery Life | The battery life is not very good here. | 3 / 5 |\n| Total | There are some cut corners, but if you\u2019re on a budget, this is a laptop that will probably make you very happy. | 4 / 5 |\nBuy the Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG if...\nYou\u2019re on a budget\nUnless one of the cut corners are a dealbreaker for you, you might not find a better deal in gaming laptops right now, especially for that 4060 GPU.\nYou want a gaming laptop that looks good\nThe Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG does not scream gaming laptop. Instead, it quietly whispers it when you take a closer look. In essence, this laptop looks good in a more traditional sense.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou need wide color coverage\nIf you care about having an accurate screen for any reason \u2013 maybe you also need to do some photo editing \u2013 this is not the laptop for you.\nYou want to game on the road\nThe battery life here is bad enough that you\u2019ll always want an outlet close by when you plan on using it. If you want something when you\u2019re commuting or remote, you should probably look elsewhere.\nAlso consider\nAcer Nitro 16 AMD\nThe Acer Nitro 16 AMD has a lot in common with the G6X 9KG reviewed here. It offers excellent performance and a fast refresh rate for not a lot of money. It does come with a weaker GPU (4050) but it has better color coverage.\nRead our full Acer Nitro 16 AMD review\nLenovo LOQ 15 (AMD)\nThe Lenovo LOQ 15 (AMD) falls into a similar camp with its value proposition. Of course, you\u2019re getting a 4050 instead of a 4060 GPU, but the battery life when not gaming is much better, making this a better option if you want your gaming laptop to also be your work laptop while on the go.\nRead our full Lenovo LOQ 15 (AMD) review\nHow I tested the Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG\n- Tested for a week\n- Pushed it as hard as possible gaming-wise\n- Played with various settings\nI used the Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG for a week, playing a number of demanding games like Hogwarts Legacy, Battlefield 2042 and Cyberpunk 2077. While doing so, I ran the games at various settings, particularly at the highest ones with ray tracing on wherever possible, and took note of the results. I also tested each aspect of the laptop from the keyboard and touchpad to the webcam and speakers.\nAfter spending time with the Gigabyte Aorus G6X 9KG, it\u2019s clear that this is ideal for any gamer on a budget, as it delivers a lot of performance for its price tag.\nI\u2019ve spent the last few years reviewing tech gear for gaming and otherwise, where I\u2019ve gotten a feel for what to look for and how to put a piece of kit through its paces to see whether it\u2019s worth the recommendation.\nWe pride ourselves on our independence and our rigorous review-testing process, offering up long-term attention to the products we review and making sure our reviews are updated and maintained - regardless of when a device was released, if you can still buy it, it's on our radar.\n- First reviewed July 2024\nJames Holland loves checking out gadgets of all sorts, whether it's audio equipment, laptops, or vacuums (especially of the robot variety), and does so for a number of Future Publications including TechRadar, Top Ten Reviews, Homes & Gardens, and T3.

      "text": "Labor Day laptop sales 2025: best early deals and what to expect next month\nExcellent 'back-to-school' laptop deals are already available this week\nThis year's Labor Day laptop sales are quickly approaching now and we're already starting to see excellent deals at major retailers. Best Buy, Dell, and a few others have excellent 'back-to-school' sales that are absolutely worth checking out if you're looking to get a cheap laptop ahead of September.\nBoth the back-to-school sales and Labor Day sales are great for laptop deals. They sit half-way between Amazon Prime Day in July and Black Friday in November, so we usually see plenty of options at major retailers.\nThis week, you can get record-low prices on Apple MacBooks, plenty of excellent cheap Windows machines at Dell, and some superb gaming laptop deals at Best Buy. We've laid out this week's best early deals just down below - and we'll have plenty more as we head through to September, so don't hesitate to bookmark and revisit.\nIf you're planning to do more shopping over the holiday then do check out our main Labor Day sales page. This comprehensive hub page covers deals on everything from TVs and headphones to appliances and mattresses. Consider it your one-stop shop for all of this event's top bargains.\nToday's best laptop sales ahead of Labor Day\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 3-7320U\nRAM: 8GB DDR5\nStorage: 512GB SSD\nIf you're looking for a cheap machine to handle the basics, then this Dell 15 laptop is almost unbelievably affordable thanks to the Dell Back to School sale this week. Although it's only got a combination of a Ryzen 3 chipset and 8GB of RAM, these should suffice if you're just looking to do simple tasks like browsing, answering emails, or streaming content.\nProcessor: Intel Core 7-150U\nRAM: 16GB DDR5\nStorage: 1TB SSD\nIf you want a relatively small laptop on a budget, the Dell Inspiron 14 is a fantastic choice. While it's a little pricier than some options, the combination of an Intel Core 7 chipset, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB SSD makes this one great for even relatively demanding applications. At 14-inches, it's also much more portable than some 16-inch and bigger options.\nProcessor: Snapdragon X Elite\nRAM: 16GB DDR5\nStorage: 512GB SSD\nDell's XPS 13 laptops are always worth keeping an eye out for during official sales for deals just like this fantastic clearance deal on the entry-level Snapdragon model. At just $749, this one is an absolute steal considering you get great performance, a 512GB SSD, and almost unbeatable battery life out of this model. Note, however, it does lack the Thunderbolt 4 ports that are exclusive to Intel versions.\nProcessor: Intel Core Ultra 7-258V\nRAM: 32GB DDR5\nStorage: 1TB SSD\nThe Dell 14 Plus is one of our favorite mid-range Windows laptops thanks to its excellent design and competitive specs. This particular configuration is a bit on the pricey end, but you do get an Ultra 7 chipset, 32GB of RAM, and a 2.5K display, meaning it's absolutely stacked with features. If I were looking for a decent everyday laptop for everything from work to demanding productivity applications, then I'd be very tempted by this deal.\nDisplay - 13.3 inches\nProcessor - Apple M1\nRAM - 8GB\nStorage - 256GB\nThe cheapest MacBook you can buy is exclusively available at Walmart. You can get the Apple MacBook Air M1 for just $599. Not only is this an outstanding price for such a powerful laptop that still holds up great for 2025, but this could be the last chance to pick one up now that it's officially discontinued. Don't miss this incredible deal if you're looking for a great bang for the buck MacBook.\nDisplay - 13.6 inches\nProcessor - Apple M2\nRAM - 16GB\nStorage - 256GB\nNewer M3 and M4 models are now available, but this is an incredible price for the 13-inch MacBook Air with an M2 chip. While it's an older version, this is still an incredibly powerful laptop for those who need a premium powerhouse for school, productivity, coding, or creative work. We highly rated it in our MacBook Air M2 review, thanks to its stylish design, clear display, impressive performance, and long 18-hour battery life.\nProcessor: Apple M4\nRAM: 16GB\nStorage: 256GB\nAmazon has a $200 discount on the latest MacBook Air - a fantastic deal if you're looking for an everyday laptop. While this particular model is a relatively iterative upgrade over the previous 2024 M3 version, it remains more powerful and more power-efficient, and features 16GB of RAM right out of the box. Overall, it's an excellent purchase for students looking to upgrade to a MacBook laptop.\nProcessor - Apple M4\nRAM - 16GB\nStorage - 256GB\nIt may essentially be just a larger version of the MacBook Air 13-inch, but if that's what you want, then that's what you get \u2013 and it's now reduced to its lowest-ever price on Amazon. Our MacBook Air 15-inch review praised the display, performance, design and speaker array, although we did think the jump in size hurt one of the MacBook Air's key selling points \u2013 its portability. Nevertheless, this is still an impressive and powerful laptop.\nGraphics card: RTX 5070\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 9\nRAM: 32GB DDR5 RAM\nStorage: 1TB SSD\nThis Asus TUF is one of the cheapest gaming laptops I've ever seen to carry the latest RTX 5070 graphics card. That alone should get you superb performance, but this machine also features an AMD Ryzen 9 chipset and 32GB of RAM. That means no glaring upgrades are needed to get great gaming and productivity performance right out of the box.\nGraphics card: RTX 5070\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen Al 7 350\nRAM: 32GB DDR5 RAM\nStorage: 1TB SSD\nThe Gigabyte Aero X16 is a new model that we haven't tested, but it looks to be a fantastic premium RTX 5070 gaming laptop. Specs-wise, it's not quite as strong as the Asus above, but you get a thin, lightweight design with premium build quality and an excellent 1600p display.\nGraphics card: RTX 5070 Ti\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 9 HX\nRAM: 16GB DDR5 RAM\nStorage: 1TB SSD\nThe Asus G16 is one of our favorite higher-end gaming laptops, and Best Buy has a great price on this RTX 5070 Ti configuration right now. With a Ryzen 9 chipset, this machine melds superb performance with a beautiful premium design. The only downside? This machine only comes with 16GB of RAM, which is a relatively easy DIY upgrade, to be fair \u2013 especially with this machine's new toolless design.\nLabor Day laptop sales 2025: FAQ\nWhen do Labor Day laptop sales start?\nLabor Day falls on Monday, September 1st for 2025 but we expect plenty of laptop sales to be available before that date. Not only do retailers generally start their retail events a few days early, but we're also in prime 'back-to-school' sales season right now.\nA lot of retailers will be looking to cash-in before college and school students head back in September so there should be plenty to check out in the run-up to the big day itself. We'll be sure to include any decent early deals right here on this page.\nIs Labor Day a good time to buy a laptop?\nLaptop sales tend to be best around Black Friday in late-November and Amazon Prime Day in mid-July but Labor Day is an important mid-point between those two events. You can definitely expect good laptop deals at the major retailers like Best Buy, Dell, and HP, as well as sales on other categories like appliances, TVs, headphones, and much more. If you're interested in seeing last year's best sales, then we've preserved a number of them just down below.\nLast year's best Labor Day laptop sales\n- Amazon: cheap laptops starting at $169.99\n- Apple: students get a $150 gift card with MacBooks\n- Best Buy: save up to $500\n- Dell: up to $700 off Inspiron and XPS\n- HP: up to 75% off latest laptops\n- Walmart: Apple MacBook from $649\nAcer Chromebook 315: was $199 now $149 at Best Buy\nDisplay - 15.6 inches\nProcessor - Intel Celeron N4020\nRAM - 4GB\nStorage - 64GB\nOS - ChromeOS\nThis Acer Chromebook 315 is a basic device but it's ridiculously cheap, making it a great buy for light use such as general browsing and schoolwork. It also boasts full-day battery life thanks to the lean but perfectly functional Chrome OS from Google, meaning it's best suited for students or those always on the move. If you have around $150 to spend and need a cheap laptop then you won't find a better option right now.\nAcer Chromebook Plus 515: was $499 now $279 at Best Buy\nDisplay - 15.6 inches\nProcessor - Intel i3\nRAM - 8GB\nStorage - 128GB\nOS - ChromeOS\nThis Acer Chromebook Plus is great value for money if you need a basic everyday device but don't want to compromise too heavily on performance like you would with a sub-$200 laptop. An Intel i3 processor and 8GB of RAM is a decent pairing with the lightweight ChromeOS, so it's capable of general tasks and light use, such as web browsing, sending emails, word processing and watching videos. Just be aware it's missing some advanced features of a Windows machine and has limited storage, but benefits include better performance with cheaper components and excellent battery life.\nDell Inspiron 15: was $379.99 now $329.99 at Dell\nDisplay - 15.6 inches\nProcessor - Intel i5\nRAM - 8GB\nStorage - 512GB\nOS - Windows 11\nIf you want a cheaper Windows option then this configuration of the Dell Inspiron 15 is an excellent buy and terrific value for money. You get an Intel i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and a large 512GB SSD to ensure good overall performance and lots of speedy storage for the price. It's a top buy right now if you're on a budget and need a laptop for general everyday use, admin tasks and light work or schoolwork.\nLenovo IdeaPad Duet 5: was $499 now $369 at Best Buy\nDisplay - 13.3 inches\nProcessor - Snapdragon 7c Gen 2\nRAM - 8GB\nStorage - 256GB\nOS - ChromeOS\nWe're big fans of the Lenovo Chromebook Duet at TechRadar so definitely want to share this significant $130 reduction on the flexible 13.3-inch laptop. In our very positive Lenovo Chromebook Duet 5 review, we thought it offered an excellent balance between tablet portability and Chromebook flexibility. This version boasts a crisp OLED touchscreen display, 8GB of RAM for good performance and a healthy 256GB of storage. Plus, the day-long battery life, slim form factor and handy keyboard cover case are a huge boost for those who are always on the go, making it one of the best Chromebooks for students.\nDell Inspiron 15: was $699.99 now $499.99 at Dell\nDisplay - 15.6 inches\nProcessor - Intel i7\nRAM - 16GB\nStorage - 1TB\nOS - Windows 11\nDell's latest set of laptop deals feature this slightly older but excellent value all-around device. With an Intel i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a large 1TB, it's a terrific buy if you have a reasonable budget and need a device that will comfortably handle your day-to-day computing jobs and general work. Expect solid performance, good multitasking capabilities, and speedy load times, but be aware of the bulky 15.6-inch size and battery life of around 6-8 hours that hamper its portability. Altogether, though, this is an impressive laptop for the price.\nHP Victus 15: was $879.99 now $529.99 at Best Buy\nDisplay: 15.6 inches\nProcessor: Intel Core i5-12450H\nGraphic card: Nvidia Geforce RTX 3050\nRAM: 8GB\nStorage: 512GB\nIf you're looking for a budget gaming laptop to cover the basics, then you'll find plenty of value with this super-cheap HP Victus at Best Buy. As the price suggests, this one is appropriate for basic 1080p gaming only but you might just be surprised at how many titles this HP will be able to play as long as you're willing to tweak a few graphical settings here and there. Don't expect to run all the latest games at Ultra settings, however.\nHP Envy 2-in-1: was $1,049.99 now $599.99 at Best Buy\nDisplay: 14 inches\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 7-8840HS\nRAM: 16GB\nStorage: 1TB\nOS: Windows 11\nThis HP has the distinct advantage of being a 2-in-1 laptop, meaning you can fold it into a tablet if you want to make use of its handy touchscreen. Specs-wise, this machine is also extremely strong for the money, featuring one of the latest Ryzen 7 chips, 16GB of RAM, and an expansive 1TB SSD. When it comes to versatility and power, this one is a strong option if you're looking for a mid-range Windows machine.\nApple MacBook Air M1 (2020): was $999 now $649 at Walmart\nDisplay - 13 inches\nProcessor - Apple M1\nRAM - 8GB\nStorage - 256GB\nOS - MacOS\nWalmart is offering the MacBook Air M1 for a new record-low price of $649, which is a steal for the device that sat atop our best laptop guide for many months. It may be a little dated now but this is still a powerful Apple device that holds up well in 2024. It can handle the computing needs of most users: be that work, browsing, video calls and even some creative tasks such as video and photo editing. Just be aware that Apple has ceased production on this model, so while it's still being supported, it may be your last chance to snag one of the best laptop deals ever before it disappears from the digital shelves for good.\nDell Inspiron 14 (2-in-1): was $949.99 now $649.99 at Dell\nDisplay - 14 inches\nProcessor - Intel Core 7\nRAM - 16GB\nStorage - 512GB\nOS - Windows 11\nHistory shows that 2-in-1 laptops usually cost a premium so the fact that this new and high-performance model has a $300 discount is not to be ignored. Specifically, this Dell Inspiron 14 has a powerful Intel Core 7 processor and 16GB of RAM for excellent overall performance, as well as a large 512GB SSD for storage. Altogether, that's a lot of power in a flexible machine that makes it great for all your computing needs, plus the tablet mode is ideal for doodlers, watching videos, or lazily browsing.\nAcer Nitro V 15: was $779.99 now $649.99 at Amazon\nDisplay: 15.6 inches\nProcessor: Intel Core i5-13420H\nGraphic card: Nvidia Geforce RTX 4050\nRAM: 8GB\nStorage: 512GB\nThough this is definitely a budget gaming laptop with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage space, it still comes with the excellent RTX 4050 GPU and a solid 13th-Gen Intel Core CPU. Its display features a snappy 144Hz refresh rate as well.\nDell Inspiron 16: was $999.99 now $699.99 at Dell\nDisplay: 16 inches\nProcessor: Intel Core 7 processor 150U\nRAM: 16GB\nStorage: 1TB\nOS: Windows 11\nMoving up in price a bit gets you this Dell Inspiron 16 with a slightly larger display and a newer chipset. Again, though, this is a solid mid-range option with plenty of power for nearly every task you could imagine, save intensive gaming applications. Overall, the Inspiron 15 above is a little bit better value than this particular listing but the 16-inch model could be a good option if you want that bigger display and a slightly flashier looking design.\nMacBook Air 13-inch (M2, 2022): was $999 now $799 at Amazon\nDisplay - 13.6 inches\nProcessor - Apple M2\nRAM - 8GB\nStorage - 256GB\nOS - macOS\nAmazon has the MacBook Air M2 for its lowest-ever price right now. Even though a newer M3 version is available, we concluded that this is still one of the best laptops you can buy in our MacBook Air M2 review, thanks to the stylish design, clear display, impressive performance, and long 18-hour battery life. For those needing a premium powerhouse for creative apps such as photo editing, video editing and more intense workloads, this is worth the investment.\nLenovo LOQ gaming laptop: was $999 now $799 at Best Buy\nDisplay: 15.6-inch\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 7-7435HS\nGraphics card: RTX 4060\nRAM: 16GB\nSSD: 512GB\n$799 is a great price to pay for an RTX 4060 gaming laptop, especially one that's also featuring a decent Ryzen 7 chipset, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD like this Lenovo LOQ. For sheer bang for the buck, it's really hard to beat this one right now as long as you're happy with playing games at 1080p resolution.\nMacBook Air 13-inch (M3): was $1,099 now $899 at Amazon\nDisplay: 13 inches\nProcessor: Apple M1\nRAM: 8GB\nStorage: 256GB\nOS: MacOS\nThe latest MacBook Air is down to $899 at Amazon \u2013 that's just $50 more than the historic low price. The brand-new model was released earlier this year and runs on the powerful M3 chipset, making it a great buy for creatives and anyone after a high-end device. Our five-star MacBook Air 13-inch M3 review praised its excellent performance, lengthy 18 hours of battery life and slick fan-less design. We think it's the best laptop you can buy right now if you've got a decent budget for a portable and powerful machine.\nMSI Cyborg 14: was $1,099.99 now $899.99 at Best Buy\nDisplay: 14 inches\nProcessor: Intel Core i7-13620H\nGraphic card: Nvidia Geforce RTX 4060\nRAM: 8GB\nStorage: 512GB\nLooking for a lightweight gaming laptop you can take anywhere? This MSI Cyborg is a rare example of a smaller 14-inch machine that still manages to pack-in some respectable specs for the price. The combination of a Core i7 and RTX 4060 are going to set you up great for 1080p gaming, although you'll want to upgrade the RAM to 16GB if you want to get the most out of this machine.\nDell Inspiron 16 Plus: was $1,099.99 now $899.99 at Dell\nDisplay - 16 inches\nProcessor - Intel Core Ultra 9\nRAM - 16GB\nStorage - 512GB\nOS - Windows 11\nIf display size is important to you, then you can upgrade to this brand-new Dell Inspiron 16 Plus, which sports a 16-inch screen and one of the latest high-end Intel Core Ultra 9 processors. You also get a generous 16GB of RAM and a decent 512GB SSD for storage, making it a powerful device that will handle anything you throw at it, though you do sacrifice portability with the larger chassis. That's likely worth it, though, if you need the extra screen real estate and high-performance components for more advanced workloads and creative tasks.\nDell XPS 13: was $1,299 now $999.99 at Dell\nDisplay - 13.4 inches\nProcessor - Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite\nRAM - 16GB\nStorage - 512GB\nOS - Windows 11\nThis is the biggest discount yet on one of the brand-new Dell XPS 13 models. As a Copilot Plus PC, it comes with one of the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon processors that boast fantastic all-around performance and exceptional battery life of around 17 hours. These are things we called out as the main positives in our Dell XPS 13 review, alongside the gorgeous OLED display and sleek overall design. It's a high-end premium device for users who need speed, performance, and responsiveness for coding, multitasking, and creative tasks.\nDell XPS 14: was $1,499 now $1,199 at Dell\nDisplay - 14 inches\nProcessor - Intel Core Ultra 7\nRAM - 16GB\nStorage - 512GB\nOS - Windows 11\nHere's an awesome high-end laptop deal in the Dell Labor Day sale: one of the newest and well-built XPS 14 devices is a healthy $300 off, bringing it back down to the record-low price we last saw in July. This is a great offer for a stylish and stunning 2024 machine that we awarded 4.5 out of five in our Dell XPS 14 review. This baseline configuration features a powerful Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD that will comfortably handle the majority of your computing needs.\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G16 Gaming Laptop: was $1,599.99 now $1,199.99 at Best Buy\nDisplay: 16-inches\nProcessor: Intel Core i7\nGraphics card: RTX 4070\nRAM: 16GB\nStorage: 512GB\nThe Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 is the 16-inch version of Asus' slimmest gaming laptop. It comes equipped with a 13th-generation Intel core and RTX 4070, Nvidia's latest mid-range graphics card. That, plus its 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage space, make it a respectable option for anyone looking for their first gaming laptop or for those looking to trade in an older machine for something more futureproof.\nAcer Predator Helios Neo 18: was $1,999.99 now $1,699.99 at Amazon\nDisplay: 18 inches\nProcessor: Intel Core i9-14900HX\nGraphics card: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070\nRAM: 32GB\nStorage: 1TB\nThis is a high-end gaming laptop with some shiny new specs ready to handle any game sent its way. It has an Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. It also features a 240Hz refresh rate and is G-Sync compatible.\nAfter more deals from the event?

We've tested each one extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\nThe best gaming laptop overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the very best gaming experience on a laptop: Packed with cutting-edge mobile gaming technology, this laptop is an absolute beast that will play the latest PC games with ease.\n\u2705 You want something to take to work: The powerful components mean this is also a great workstation laptop, and thanks to its subtle and classy design, you could take this into the office without raising eyebrows.\n\u274c You\u2019re on a budget: Razer doesn't make budget devices, and while for the high asking price for the Blade 16 you get incredible performance, there are some great affordable alternatives out there.\n\u274c You value portability: The Razer Blade 16 is impressively thin for a gaming laptop, but the 16-inch screen does mean that this isn't the easiest laptop to lug around.\nRazer's iconic gaming laptop is back for 2025 and better than ever. We reviewed the high-end model with Nvidia's mighty RTX 5090 laptop GPU, and we were blown away by the performance, with the Razer Blade 16 easily handling anything we threw at it. This included playing games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Red Dead Redemption 2 at their highest settings. With help from Nvidia's DLSS and Multi Frame Generation (MFG) features, we got Alan Wake 2, a graphically-intensive game, running at around 200fps (frames per second) - an incredible result. Meanwhile Cyberpunk 2077, one of the best looking games of recent times, hit a whopping 217fps even with ray tracing set to max. Basically, you'll be able to play any game at its highest settings for a long, long time to come.\nThe design of the Razer Blade 16 (2025) is stunning, with a sleek thin and light design that puts other gaming laptops to shame. Build quality is excellent, and while there's no 4K option for the display, at 16-inches with a 240Hz refresh rate and OLED technology, games look absolutely gorgeous when played - we're still reeling from walking the neon-drenched streets of Cyberpunk 2077's Night City. This all comes at a cost, however, with the Blade 16 starting at a rather intimidating $2,999.99 / \u00a32,699.99 / AU$4,899.95, which means it simply won't be an option for a lot of people. If that's the case, read on for some much more affordable gaming laptop picks that will still provide an excellent gaming experience. However, if you have the money and want the very best gaming laptop that's on sale right now, then the Razer Blade 16 (2025) is the laptop to get.\nRead the full Razer Blade 16 (2025) review\nTake a look at our Razer discount codes for the best Razer offers and savings.\n\ud83d\udcbb The Razer Blade 16 (2025) delivers power and style in spades, offering best-in-class performance in games and even managing to hold its own as a day-to-day work laptop thanks to the improved battery life. Nvidia RTX 5000 GPU options bring DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation to the party, and some small but smart design tweaks from the previous model help make this an even better high-end laptop. Read the full review: Razer Blade 16 (2025)\nThe best affordable gaming laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You\u2019re a competitive gamer: The RTX 4050 GPU and 165Hz refresh rate are great for eSports.\n\u2705 You're on a tight-ish budget: You won\u2019t spend a lot to get decent gaming performance, especially at 1080p.\n\u274c You value portability: This is one very bulky gaming laptop.\n\u274c You\u2019re tired of the 'gamer' aesthetic: A lot of great laptops have dated, 'gamer' designs, but this one is a bit more dated than some others.\nWith an outstanding mix of specs, speedy display, and fantastic price for its midrange configuration, the Acer Nitro 16 is one of the best laptops for gaming for those with enough money to do a midrange machine, but only just barely.\nThe Nitro 16 will get you excellent 1080p gaming performance, especially thanks to a speedy 165Hz display that makes it perfect for esports and other competitive titles. Not a lot of gaming laptops for under $1,500/\u00a31,500/AU$2,100 can say that.\nStill, there are trade-offs, and the more aggressive 'gamer' design on the Nitro 16 really could have used more innovation rather than stick with what gaming laptops have been doing for the past several years. It's webcam isn't great either, and it's a rather bulky machine to the point where it might have been a desktop replacement if it had better specs. Still, if you're looking just past the 'budget' horizon for your next gaming laptop, this is an excellent choice.\nRead the full Acer Nitro 16 review\n\ud83d\udcbb The Acer Nitro 16 offers solid gaming performance at a budget-friendly price, featuring a 165Hz refresh rate and a robust keyboard with RGB backlighting. While it does not excel in aesthetics and is somewhat bulky, its overall functionality and affordability make it a commendable choice for competitive gamers on a budget. Read the full review: Acer Nitro 16\nThe best premium gaming laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the best-designed gaming laptop money can buy: The Alienware 16 Area-51 is one gorgeous-looking gaming laptop with an exceptional build quality.\n\u2705 You want premium gaming performance: The Alienware 16 Area-51 comes with some of the most powerful mobile components you can get in 2025, offering excellent gaming performance no matter what title you're playing.\n\u274c You want the best screen: The Alienware 16 Area-51's screen isn't the best out there, with colors sometimes looking washed out. If screen quality is essential, check out the Razer Blade 16 (2025) above, which is our pick as the best gaming laptop overall.\n\u274c You want long battery life: Most gaming laptops offer poor battery lives due to the powerful components they use, and sadly the Alienware 16 Area-51 is no different. There are gaming laptops out there that offer better battery life, so if that's important look elsewhere.\nAlienware has a fine reputation for creating gorgeous gaming laptops that don't just look great, they are also packed with cutting-edge hardware, and the Alienware 16 Area-51 continues this fine tradition - in fact, we'd say this is the best gaming laptop Alienware has ever made, and that's high praise indeed.\nIn our review we highlighted the design, especially the multi-zone customizable lighting, smart port placement, clever ventilation, and clear glass panel on the bottom to show of the internals as particularly impressive. The mechanical keyboard feels amazing to play on (as well as work on), and gaming performance in general was incredibly impressive, with demanding games like Cyberpunk 2077, Black Myth: Wukong, Forza Motorsport (2023), and Doom: The Dark Ages all easily hitting over 60fps at their highest settings.\nThis results in the best premium gaming laptop your money can buy. Speaking of which, with a price starting at $1,999.99 / \u00a32,149.01 / AU$4,198.70, this is an expensive laptop, especially if you go for one of the higher configurations.\nThere are some flaws, however. There's no escaping the fact that the screen quality is a tad disappointing, with colors failing to 'pop' as much as more vibrant screens found in some gaming laptops. Battery life is also disappointingly short at just over three hours, but that is par for the course for gaming laptops, sadly.\nRead the full Alienware 16 Area-51 review\n\ud83d\udcbb The Alienware 16 Area-51 stands out with an eye-catching design that sets a tough standard for competitors. Underneath, it delivers impressive gaming performance, an excellent keyboard, and capable speakers. While the 240Hz display offers fast refresh rates, the overall image quality doesn\u2019t quite live up to expectations, and battery life during non-gaming use is lackluster.

Resembling the bold designs of pre-pandemic gaming laptops, it focuses on essential gaming performance. It's a top choice for budget gamers, despite some style and battery compromises. Priced starting at $999, it features a 13th-Gen Intel Core i7, 16GB of RAM, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050, and a 1TB SSD, outperforming similarly priced laptops with older specs.\nAlternatives like the Acer Nitro 5, with slightly older components, offer cheaper but less powerful options. The MSI Katana 15 also has pricier versions, with the highest model at $1,899, offering an Intel Core i9, 32GB of RAM, and an Nvidia RTX 4070, though still limited to a 1080p display. Configurations vary by region, with different processor generations and price points.\nDespite its bulk and dated design, the Katana 15 prioritizes gaming performance. Its thermal design effectively cools both CPU and GPU. Performance-wise, it impresses, handling demanding games like Control and Far Cry 6 smoothly, with minor adjustments needed for games like Cyberpunk 2077. The Katana 15, while not without its limitations, offers a balanced gaming experience, showcasing how it effectively blends power and affordability.\nRead the full MSI Katana 15 review\n\ud83d\udcbb The MSI Katana 15 provides solid 1080p gaming performance at an affordable price, making it a strong entry-level option for gamers. It features decent specifications for the price but compromises on aspects like battery life and trackpad quality, making it less ideal for portable use. Read the full review: MSI Katana 15 (2023)\nThe best large-screen gaming laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want desktop-level performance, but portable: Sure, the MSI Titan 18 HX AI isn't the most portable laptop, but it beats lugging around a desktop gaming rig, without sacrificing performance.\n\u2705 You want great performance: Performance scores high on every benchmark with high frame rates at highest settings thanks to the cutting-edge components you'll find within.\n\u274c You want something affordable: The MSI Titan 18 HX AI comes with high-end hardware, and that means that the price is also very high. There are plenty of great gaming laptops on this list that are almost half the price.\n\u274c You want to travel lots with your laptop: The MSI Titan 18 HX AI is more portable than a desktop PC, but it's still very large and bulky, so if you want a laptop to game on while travelling, this probably isn't the best choice.\nA while ago, if you wanted the very best gaming experience, you had no option but to buy (or build) a gaming desktop PC, but these days, laptops like the MSI Titan 18 HX AI have proved that you can get desktop-level performance in a reasonably portable laptop form factor.\nThe MSI Titan 18 HX AI offers the most powerful mobile components, with a top-of-the-range Intel Core Ultra 9 200HX series processor, and the Nvidia RTX 5090 laptop GPU with a huge 24GB of GDDR7. While gaming PCs with the desktop version of the 5090 will still be more powerful (the laptop 5090 is a cut-down version), the MSI Titan 18 HX AI will likely out perform the vast majority of gaming PCs. It also features a huge 18-inch display, so even if you don't have it hooked up to a gaming monitor or TV, you're still getting a very immersive experience.\nThat large screen does mean this isn't the most portable of gaming laptops, but even so, it's still far easier to carry around than a gaming PC, making it a great choice for students or people who like to take part in LAN parties and esports. Performance-wise the MSI Titan 18 HX AI delivers in spades, with even graphically-demanding games like Metro: Exodus and Cyberpunk 2077 hitting well over 60fps on their highest settings. Whack on DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation and you can get some fantastic results that fully make use of the 120Hz refresh rate of the large screen. Unfortunately, the ultra-powerful components mean battery life isn't that great - and the price is also very, very high.\nRead the full MSI Titan 18 HX AI review\n\ud83d\udcbb The MSI Titan 18 HX AI isn't your typical gaming laptop. Rather than focusing on portability and good-enough performance, the Titan brings serious power to the table - where it'll stay most of the time. It's not without faults, like loud fans and a touchy trackpad, but when you consider the capabilities of an RTX 5090 paired with a gorgeous 4K display, the MSI Titan 18 HX is easy to recommend as a large-screen desktop replacement if you have the scratch. Read the full review: MSI Titan 18 HX AI\nThe best desktop replacement gaming laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a high refresh rate display: For fast-paced games where reaction speeds can make a big difference to winning or losing, the 240Hz screen on the MSI Vector A18 HX A9W is ideal, especially paired with the RTX 5080 GPU.\n\u2705 You want a laptop that acts as a desktop replacement: Thanks to the powerful components sitting within the portable laptop form factor, the MSI Vector A18 HX A9W is a great desktop replacement laptop that gives you far more portability than a standard PC.\n\u274c You need a laptop with long battery life: Yes, this is a gaming laptop, and yes we're complaining about battery life. The MSI Vector A18 HX A9W, like many on this list, has a very short battery life, so you'll need to plug it in when playing.\n\u274c You want something portable: This laptop isn't just heavy, its 18-inch display means it won't fit in just about any backpack.\nWe fell in love with the MSI Vector A18 HX A9W while reviewing it, mainly thanks to the excellent performance it delivered in some of our favorite games, including Cyberpunk 2077, Indiana Jones: The Great Circle, and the Resident Evil 4 remake. Making full use of the powerful RTX 5080 GPU, even the most demanding of games hit over 100fps, and with DLSS and Multi Frame Generation turned on, some games were even north of 200fps - giving the 240Hz refresh rate of the screen an opportunity to truly shine.\nBuild quality is excellent, though this is a large gaming laptop, which means it's best suited as a desktop replacement, which gives you gaming PC-like performance in a more portable laptop design, though if you want a gaming laptop that's comfortable to carry around, I recommend you consider the Razer Blade 16 instead.\nOne of the things we loved the most about the MSI Vector A18 HX A9W is the ECO-Silent mode, which is enabled via the MSI Center software. This mode reduces the power sent to components, which in turn lowers their temperatures and minimizes fan noise. Thanks to an excellent set of customization options, including setting whether the ECO-Silent mode sticks to using the less powerful integrated graphics of the AMD Ryzen 9955HX processor, or making use of the RTX 5080 graphics card (which means more power is used, but also gaming performance is much better), the ECO-Silent mode did a fantastic job of reducing fan noise with minimal impact to gaming performance.\nFor people (like me) who get frustrated by gaming laptops that sound like they are about to take off when playing games, the ECO-Silent mode is a real game changer, and an all-too-rare example of a manufacturer's pre-installed software offering genuinely useful tools to improve the experience of the user.\nOn the downside, battery life is short, and it can take a while to fully charge. As a desktop replacement, you'll be wanting to use this while plugged in for the most part, especially as gaming performance drops significantly when just using the battery (a feature that lowers the power sent to the components to maximize the battery life).\nAlso, with the MSI Vector A18 HX A9W starting at $2,999.99 / \u00a33,199 / AU$6,599 for the RTX 5080 model, this is also a very, very expensive machine. You'll not need to buy a new one for many years to come, but that doesn't make that high initial outlay any easier to stomach.\nRead the full MSI Vector A18 HX A9W review\n\ud83d\udcbb The MSI Vector A18 HX A9W is easy for me to recommend to people buying a gaming laptop, with a powerful RTX 5080 mobile GPU acting as the driving force for high-quality gaming. At its native 2560x1600 resolution, it storms through the most demanding triple-A games like Cyberpunk 2077 without much effort. However, it is very expensive, so I know it won't be for everyone. Read the full review: MSI Vector A18 HX A9W\nThe best laptop for video editing and gaming\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a powerful laptop for gaming and creative work: Thanks to the powerful components and excellent desktop-level performance, plus a gorgeous OLED screen, the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i is a brilliant choice for people who want a laptop for not just gaming, but also doing creative work such as photo and video editing.\n\u2705 You want the best-looking display on a gaming laptop: The Lenovo Legion Pro 7i's screen is easily the best you can get on a gaming laptop in 2025 thanks to a stunning OLED panel that makes colors bright and vibrant, HDR support and an incredibly fast 240Hz refresh rate.\n\u274c You have a tight budget: This is another very expensive gaming laptop, and while for the money you're getting cutting-edge components and the best display you'll find on a gaming laptop, it also means this will be out of reach for a lot of people.\n\u274c You want a long battery life: If you want a laptop, even a gaming one, that you can use for long periods of time without needing to plug it in, then this won't be for you. The powerful components and demanding screen tech mean battery life is particularly low.\nSpending a large amount of cash on a new gaming laptop can be hard to justify, but if the laptop, like the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i, can also double as a device to work on, those high prices become much easier to swallow.\nThe reason why I've picked the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i as the best laptop for both gaming and working on is in part due to the incredibly powerful components which don't just make playing the very latest AAA games on it a joy, but also means demanding creative projects, like 3D modelling, video editing, and content creation can be completed quickly. If your income depends on completing projects for clients, being able to turn them around more quickly and take on more work could actually mean that buying the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i is a wise investment - and the fact that it can play games is the icing on the cake.\nAnother reason why I think this is the best gaming laptop for also doing creative work in is because of the gorgeous OLED screen with HDR support and 100% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage. This means that colors don't just look bright and vibrant, they are also accurate, which can be essential for people working in the creative industry.\nOf course, that OLED screen also makes games look incredible, and the 240Hz refresh rate means that titles feel fast and responsive. Even if you don't need a laptop for creative work, the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i is an excellent gaming laptop that handles the latest games with ease. Our only reservations in the review are the very high price and short battery life.\nRead the full Lenovo Legion Pro 7i review\n\ud83d\udcbb Yes, the battery life of the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i isn't great, but this is a gaming laptop, and a powerful one at that. It can handle just about anything gaming-wise, comes with a gorgeous OLED screen, and has more than enough ports for all your gaming needs. Just be ready to spend quite a good chunk of change on it. Read the full review: Lenovo Legion Pro 7i\nbest gaming laptop: FAQs\nWhat are the best gaming laptop brands?\nThere are several major brands for gaming laptops to look out for from several manufacturers.\nAcer: Acer makes some of the best gaming laptops for those on a budget thanks to its Nitro line, but its Predator brand of gaming laptops are for more high-end and enthusiast users.\nAsus: Asus has a number of gaming laptop brands that are very popular with gamers, including its budget-friendly TUF Gaming brand, its midrange Republic of Gamers (ROG), and its high-end Strix brand.\nDell: Dell has two main gaming brands under two different company names, Dell and Alienware. Dell gaming laptops like it's G-series are more budget-friendly offerings, while Alienware has two major brands, the x-series and m-series, with the former being more midrange, while the latter is more high-end.\nGigabyte: Gigabyte's main gaming brand is its Aorus line of laptops, which can range from budget-friendly to high-end, but it also sells budget gaming laptops under the stand-alone Gigabyte imprint.\nHP: HP currently has two gaming brands, the lower-end Victus series and the high-end Omen line. While Omen laptops can dip into the near budget category, depending on the specs, you won't ever see a Victus laptop loaded with top-of-the-line specs like RTX 4080 GPUs.\nMSI: MSI has been a gaming laptop mainstay almost since the form factor's beginnings, and so it has several gaming laptop brands like its high-end Titan, its midrange Vector, and more affordable Katana and Cyborg laptops.\nOrigin: Origin's main gaming laptop brand is its EON like, but Origin is more of a custom gaming laptop builder, and it is one of the few companies where you can custom-build your laptop, offering many different aesthetics as well.\nRazer: The OG gaming laptop maker, Razer released the original gaming laptop, the Razer Blade, in 2011, and continues to produce different sizes and configurations of the Blade, all of which are generally excellent.\nWhich component matters most for gaming laptops?\nWhile all components play their part in your gaming experience, the GPU is the one component most directly tied to how many frames per second you'll be able to get for a given resolution, so this should be your focus, with RAM and CPU following after, then storage. You won't need more than a 1440p display for the most part, and a 1080p display on a laptop is more than enough for a great gaming experience.\nIs it worth it to get a gaming laptop?\nDefinitely. The gap between gaming PCs and mobile devices has significantly narrowed, as laptops have become both more compact and more powerful. If you're looking for a device that saves space and offers portability, yet still packs enough power to handle everything from less demanding games to the most graphically-intensive titles, one of the top gaming laptops should be on your list.\nAre gaming laptops good for video editing?\nThanks to their powerful dedicated graphics cards, which are often paired with powerful processors and plenty of RAM, gaming laptops make excellent devices for video editing. Nvidia even releases 'Studio' drivers for its laptop graphics cards which focus on creative applications, rather than the usual 'Game Ready' drivers which, as the name suggests, focus on maximizing gaming performance. Many gaming laptops also offer best-in-class displays, often with support for the DCI-P3 wide color gamut for professional-class color accuracy.\nAre gaming laptops as good as desktops?\nA few year's ago the answer to the question of what's better, a gaming laptop or a gaming PC, was pretty clear cut: a gaming PC is the way to go for pure performance. These days, the answer isn't quite as easy thanks to mobile components coming along in leaps and bounds, so you can often find high-end gaming laptops that can beat many desktop PCs. However, gaming desktop PCs remain the most powerful way to play the best PC games, as desktop components still have the edge compared to their laptop counterparts. Gaming PCs also aren't as constrained when it comes to cooling, as you can fit in more fans and liquid cooling loops into the larger designs - which also benefit from better airflow. Because gaming laptops need to be relatively thin and light, keeping components cool under load is more tricky. Desktop PCs can also be cheaper, and due to their modular nature they are easier to upgrade when the time comes. However, gaming laptops are better for people who need flexibility and portability as they are much easier to carry around. Check out our guide to the best gaming PCs for our pick of the ultimate gaming rigs.\nHow to choose the best gaming laptop for you\n1080p: Nvidia RTX 5050/5060 or AMD Radeon 7600M XT\n1440p: Nvidia RTX 5070/5070 Ti or AMD Radeon 7800M\n2160p: Nvidia RTX 5080 / 5090 or AMD Radeon 7900M\nSelecting the best gaming laptop is straightforward if you have a substantial budget, but finding a high-quality gaming laptop becomes more challenging with limited funds. Fortunately, the market now offers more budget-friendly CPUs and GPUs that don't skimp on power.\nFor all resolutions, 16GB RAM and at least 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD storage is recommended. Increasingly, 8GB RAM isn't going to be enough for gaming, and many modern PC titles can use up 100GB of storage, so 512GB might not be enough for your game library. You'll also need an Intel Core i5 or Core 5 Ultra processor, or an AMD Ryzen 5 processor, at minimum, but an Intel Core i7/Core 7 Ultra processor or the AMD Ryzen 7 equivalent is recommended.\nFor 1080p gaming, to get 60 fps on most games at their highest settings, you'll need at least an Nvidia RTX 5050 or AMD Radeon RX 7600M XT GPU, though an Nvidia RTX 5060 is preferred. If the video memory (VRAM) of the GPU is 8GB, then 1080p is the best resolution to play at (you certainly don't want less than 8GB).\nFor 1440p gaming, to get 60 fps on most games on max graphical settings, you'll need to make sure you have at least an Nvidia RTX 5070 GPU, though an RTX 5070 Ti is better, and for AMD, a Radeon RX 7800M will be enough for 1440p gaming. You'll want to make sure that the VRAM for the GPU is 12GB at a minimum.\nFor 2160p (4K) gaming, you'll need a bare minimum of an Nvidia RTX 5080 or AMD RX 7900M GPU, but to ensure that you're getting consistent 60 fps on most modern PC titles, you may want to invest in a gaming laptop with an RTX 5090 graphics card. You'll certainly want a GPU with no less than 16GB of VRAM. Remember, even if a gaming laptop doesn't come with a 4K screen (few do), you can still connect it to a 4K monitor or 4K TV.\nHow we tested these gaming laptops\nEvaluating a gaming laptop is more complex than it might seem, much like the process of choosing the right one. We approach this task with the utmost seriousness, even if it involves extensive gaming \u2013 a necessary sacrifice, of course.\nIn our rigorous testing process, every gaming laptop undergoes thorough evaluation to ensure it lives up to its promises and justifies your investment. This involves not only playing the latest and most popular games to assess gaming and thermal performance but also conducting synthetic benchmarks like PCMark 10, 3DMark, and Geekbench 6, along with battery life tests.\nCurrently, as of July 2025, these are the games we use to benchmark the gaming laptops we review. Recently, we've included both native game performance as well as looking at how upscaling technology, particularly DLSS, impacts performance. While native gameplay remains the best way to judge the raw power of a gaming laptop, most PC gamers play with upscaling enabled, so we want our benchmarks to reflect the experience many gamers will have.\nGame | Settings |\nCivilization VII | Balanced Upscaling, Max Resolution, High | Max Resolution, High | 1080p, Medium |\nShadow of the Tomb Raider | Balanced Upscaling - Max Resolution, Highest | Max Resolution, Highest | 1080p, Medium |\nTotal War: Warhammer III: Mirrors of Madness | Max Resolution, Ultra | Max Resolution, Ultra | 1080p, Medium |\nCyberpunk 2077 | Balanced Upscaling - Max Resolution, Ultra | Max Resolution, Ultra | 1080p, Medium |\nBlack Myth: Wukong | Balanced Upscaling [50%] - Max Resolution, Cinematic | 1080p, Cinematic |\nMonster Hunter Wilds | Balanced Upscaling [50%] - Max Resolution, Max Quality | 1080p, Max Quality |\nDune: Awakening | Balanced Upscaling [50%] - Max Resolution, Max Quality | 1080p, Max Quality |\nCounterstrike 2 | Max Resolution, Very High | 1080p, Low |\nRed Dead Redemption 2 | Balanced Upscaling [50%] - Max Resolution, Max Quality | 1080p, Max Quality |\nMetro: Exodus | Max Resolution, Extreme | 1080p, Extreme |\nAssassins Creed: Shadows | Balanced Upscaling [50%] - Max Resolution, Max Quality | 1080p, Max Quality |\nHorizon: Zero Dawn Remaster | Balanced Upscaling [50%] - Max Resolution, Max Quality | 1080p, Max Quality |\nF1 2024 | Balanced Upscaling [50%] - Max Resolution, Max Quality | 1080p, Max Quality |\nWe are continually revising the list of benchmarked games to ensure we're testing gaming laptops with a mix of the very latest games alongside ever-popular games, with a mix of genres. While most of the games we benchmark are used to test the capabilities of a laptop's GPU, we also include titles such as Total War: Warhammer III, which are more CPU-intensive to make sure the processor of the gaming laptop we're reviewing can keep up without causing performance bottlenecks.\nWhen benchmarking these games, we're evaluating the average frame rate the gaming laptop achieves. This is measured in frames per second (fps), and the more frames per second the game hits, the better the performance.\nAnother very important factor to consider when buying any laptop is the battery life. Due to the power-hungry components inside the best gaming laptops, their batteries don't last nearly as long as standard laptops. It's also worth noting that many gaming laptops will reduce the performance of the GPU and CPU (a process sometimes known as 'throttling') when on battery power, so for the best gaming performance, you'll usually want it plugged in anyway.\nOf course, when you're not gaming, you'll still want to use your laptop when away from a plug socket, so we extensively test out each gaming laptop's battery with a series of benchmarks designed to run the battery down and record the times.\nThese benchmarks replicate real-world use such as web browsing (our Web Surfing Battery Informant benchmark), general use, and gaming (PCMark 10), and video playback (where we run a looped 1080p video with screen brightness set to 50% until the battery dies). We combine this with real-world experience during the review,s where we use the laptop on battery power throughout a work day and see how fast the laptop takes to fully charge its battery to get the best possible idea of how long a laptop's battery lasts.\nWe also scrutinize the laptop's peripherals. This includes checking the display's quality and response time, the comfort and responsiveness of the keyboard, the availability and variety of ports, the overall design, and the webcam's performance for potential game streaming use.\nFinally, we weigh all these factors against the laptop's price. We assess if its performance and features justify the cost and whether it offers the best value to customers.\nToday's best gaming laptop deals\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.\nNamed by the CTA as a CES 2020 Media Trailblazer for his science and technology reporting, John specializes in all areas of computer science, including industry news, hardware reviews, PC gaming, as well as general science writing and the social impact of the tech industry.\nYou can find him online on Bluesky @johnloeffler.bsky.social\n- Matt HansonManaging Editor, Core Tech"

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Gigabyte Aero 14 is a powerful creative workstation with one of the best screens I\u2019ve seen on a laptop, but it has a few serious caveats. It\u2019s competitively priced in the US, but it costs almost the same as the MacBook Pro in Australia, and it's hard to find in the UK. A sub 5-hour battery life makes work on the go a challenge and the speakers aren\u2019t as loud and full as other devices in its class.\nPros\n- +\nBrightest OLED screen\n- +\nCompetitive US price\n- +\nLight and portable\nCons\n- -\nPoor battery life\n- -\nExpensive in US/AU\n- -\nSpeakers underwhelming\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nGigabyte Aerop 14: Two Minute Review\nThe Aero 14 has long been the most work-focused offering from Taiwanese PC component and gaming laptop manufacturer Gigabyte, but while this business Ultrabook is thin and light, it\u2019s got plenty to offer under the hood.\nThe 14-inch 3K OLED display is one of the brightest screens we\u2019ve seen on a laptop, OLED or otherwise, so it\u2019s no surprise that it\u2019s capable of extreme vibrancy and contrast. Add to this a pro video color gamut with precise color accuracy and it\u2019s more than capable of handling creative workloads.\nThe 14-core Intel 13th generation CPU and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU combine to provide more than enough grunt for more demanding creative workflows. If you need a lot of RAM you might need to look elsewhere since the 16GB of DDR5 is non-upgradable, but for most this should be enough and is balanced well with the rest of the machine\u2019s capabilities.\nThe physical design is great, with a lot of attention to detail in the CNC unibody chassis and port selection. I also liked Gigabyte\u2019s Control Center software which offers the unique benefit of a driver update centre that helps you keep on top of software updates outside of Windows 11\u2019s remit.\nUnfortunately, the CPU is around 20 percent behind Apple\u2019s M2 Pro or Max processors and the 90W maximum power draw drains the 63Wh battery in 4 to 5 hours depending on the task. This poor battery life makes it a harder sell as a portable creative device and so while it\u2019s one of the thinnest and lightest creative workstations around, it\u2019s really only suitable for those that have access to power where they work.\nGigabyte Aero 14: Price and availability\n- $1599 / \u00a32,384 / AU$2,999\n- Available now\n- Available in the US and AU, limited availability in the UK\nWhile the US is clearly Gigabyte\u2019s preferred market selling the Aero 14 OLED for just $1599, the UK and Australia get hit with a massive tax with the device going for \u00a32,384 and AU$2,999, respectively.\nIt\u2019s pretty disappointing to see such wild differences in price across markets so keep in mind that the scores are reflected for the US market only, with about a half mark deduction required for Australia and a 'don\u2019t bother' ticket for the one place I could see it available in the UK.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n- Price score: 3.5 / 5\nGigabyte Aero 14: Specs\nThere is only one version of the Gigabyte Aero 14 OLED (2023) available globally. It can be differentiated from its predecessor by the 13th generation Intel Core processor.\nYou can see the specs for the available model below.\n| Component | Gigabyte Aero 14 OLED (2023) |\n|---|---|\n| CPU | Intel Core i7-13700H |\n| GPU | Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 6GB GDDR6 |\n| RAM | 16GB DDR5 |\n| Storage | 1TB SSD |\n| Ports | 3x USB 3.2 Gen 1 (Type-C), 1x USB 3.2 (Type-A), 1x HDMI, MicroSD card reader, 1x 3.5mm audio jack |\n| Screen | 14-inch OLED (2880 x 1800),90Hz, 100% DCI-P3, Display HDR 600 True Black; Delta E 1 |\n| Wireless | Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax) |\n| Camera | FHD 1080p |\n| Weight | 3.28 lbs (1.49 kg) |\n| Dimensions | 12.3 x 8.7 x 0.67 inches (311 x 220.8 x 1.7mm) |\nGigabyte Aero 14: Design\n- Amazing OLED screen\n- Tough aluminum chassis\n- Good port selection\nIt\u2019s been a minute since we last covered an Aero from Gigabyte and it seems the range that was once defined by its pops of orange and green on the cover has matured into a sleek silver workhorse that won\u2019t rock the boat in an office setting.\nStill, it\u2019s nice to see that the company is forging its own path in laptop design with unique little details, including an HDMI port at the rear of the device that looks like the exhaust of a sports car and a fast-looking set of thermal vents.\nThe laptop is covered in a CNC milled aluminum chassis that offers a lot of strength for its thin and light design. We would\u2019ve probably preferred a slightly more subdued silver coloring over the gaudy platinum on offer, but it\u2019s still an elegant overall finish.\nThe most striking design feature is undoubtedly the screen. The device has been fitted with an OLED panel that offers Vesa HDR 600 True Black certification, making it the brightest of its kind that I\u2019ve seen. The Apple MacBook Pro 14 (M1) offers 1000nit peak brightness and the new M2 powered Pros feature an impressive 1600nit peak brightness, but they are not OLED panels which makes it difficult to make a direct comparison.\nNevertheless, the smooth 90Hz display on the Aero 14 OLED offers a sharp 2880 by 1800 pixel resolution and a full DCI-P3 colour gamut commonly used in professional video production, which pushes this bright OLED into being an exceptionally vibrant screen that is perfectly suited to creative work.\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking the Aero 14 only packs 'modern' ports, with its array of three Thunderbolt / USB-C ports, one microSD card reader and one headphone jack on the sides, but it also sneaks in a legacy USB-A port on the back next to the HDMI, which is bound to come in handy.\nGigabyte Aero 14: Performance\n- Decent CPU performance\n- Solid GPU performance\nHere's how the Gigabyte Aero 14 performed in our suite of benchmark tests:\n3DMark: Port Royal: 3,579; Time Spy Extreme: 3,054; Time Spy: 6,696; Port Royal: 4,834\nGeekBench 5: 1,669 (single-core); 12,375 (multi-core)\nCinebench R23 Multi-core: 12,239 points\nCyberpunk 2077 (1080p, Ultra): 70.92 fps;\nRDR2 (1080p, Ultra): 66.35 fps;\nCrystal DiskMark 8 (Read/ Write): 6,965/5005 MB/s\nPCMark 10 (Home Test): 6,696 points\nBattery Life (TechRadar movie test): 4 hours, 45 minutes\nThere\u2019s a few different ways to look at performance of the Gigabyte Aero 14 OLED device, but the most straightforward is that it's got a powerful CPU and GPU that combine to mean you'll breeze through demanding creative workloads.\nWhen you look at it against the competition, it\u2019s hard not to compare it to the MacBook Pro 14, especially in Australia where they\u2019re priced very similarly. The Intel Core i7-3700H is about 20 percent behind the Apple M2 Pro or Max processors in comparable CPU tasks. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 is however capable of keeping up with graphical performance from the top MacBook Pro processor.\nAnyone hoping to play games after their creative work can expect 60 frames-per-second and above on modern titles at 1080p Ultra settings. You can even utilise the slightly higher 90Hz refresh rate for smoother visuals on less demanding titles.\nGigabyte Aero 14: Battery life\n- 3h38min work lifespan\n- 4h45min movie playback\nEven if Gigabyte went with a processor like the AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS, it wouldn\u2019t have been able to achieve battery life like what you get on the Apple MacBook Pro devices without sacrificing performance further, so it can only take so much responsibility for the disappointing battery life. That said, it could have easily added another half a pound (200g) to the battery to take the edge off the 3 hours and 38 minutes it\u2019ll last during standard work benchmarking.\nThis equates to just 4 hours and 45 minutes in movie playback, which is more than enough to watch a movie and is even ok for a gaming laptop, but it\u2019s around half to a third of what you\u2019ll get from Apple silicon.\nShould you buy the Gigabyte Aero 14 OLED?\n| Attributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\n| Price | Great price in the US, fair in AU and expensive in UK. | 3.5 / 5 |\n| Specs | Just one configuration, RAM not upgradable. | 4 / 5 |\n| Design | Great OLED screen, lightweight. | 4 / 5 |\n| Performance | Decent CPU and good GPU performance. | 4 / 5 |\n| Battery | Terrible battery life for a work laptop. | 2.5 / 5 |\n| Average total | Overall, this is a great gaming laptop that offers some solid performance and specs for its price point. A few flaws hold it back from true greatness, however. | 3.5/ 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou need a powerful Windows laptop\nThe sleek, portable design is one of the lightest available and the discrete graphics card makes it capable of more demanding workloads .\nYou want the best 14-inch screen\nThe Aero 14\u2019s 3K OLED panel is exceptionally bright and offers full DCI-P3 colour with Delta E < 1 accuracy. It comes with a bonus 90Hz refresh rate for smoother visuals and a naturally quick response rate for anyone wanting to dabble in games outside of hours.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou need something that runs on battery\nThe Aero 14 is realistically only going to last a few hours at most if you\u2019re working with the graphics card running, so if you need to work away from power this probably isn\u2019t the laptop for you.\nYou Need a lot of RAM\nThe device comes with a maximum 16GB of RAM that can not be upgraded, which will present a challenge for anyone with more intensive workflows.\nGigabyte Aero 14: Also consider\nApple MacBook Pro 14\nThe main competition for the Gigabyte Aero 14 OLED is the Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch device. With better battery life and slightly better performance at a similar price, it\u2019s a compelling alternative.\nRead the full Apple MacBook Pro 14\nGigabyte Aero 16\nI you need a bigger screen and even more power than what you get on the Aero 14, it might be worth considering the bigger sibling.\nRead the full Gigabyte Aero 16 review\nHow I tested the Gigabyte Aero 14\n- I tested it using both benchmark tests and video game benchmarks\n- I stress-tested the battery using the TechRadar movie test\nI ran the Gigabyte Aero 14 through our standard suite of benchmarks to get a feel for the laptop's peak performance and to see how it compares with the best on the market.\nIn addition to our standard suite of testing, I also tested the device using it for a day of work to see how it fares when typing, web browsing, working and for light photo and video editing tasks.\nThe screen was analysed using TechRadar's standard movie test and was compared against other screens running standard web browsing and movie editing software.\nThe battery life was benchmarked with two tests to simulate different battery life scenarios.\nFirst reviewed August 2023\nJoel Burgess is one of the Senior Writers on the TechRadar Australia team with over 9 years experience testing and reviewing laptops, gadgets and kitchen accessories from coffee machines to pizza ovens.
