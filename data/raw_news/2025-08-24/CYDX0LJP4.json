  "description": "He will have plenty of time to think about his actions - in prison",
  "content": "\u2022 A software developer sabotaged his employer after being demoted\n\u2022 Davis Lu created a \"kill switch\" that would lock out all users\n\u2022 He was sentenced to four years in jail and additional three years of supervised leave\n\nA disgruntled worker has been sentenced to four years in prison after installing \u201ckill switch\u201d malware on his employer\u2019s network which was set to trigger if he ever lost network access.\n\nAccording to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release, a Chinese national named Davis Lu was working for an unnamed software company between November 2007 and October 2019. In 2018, he was demoted and lost system access, after which he \u201cbegan sabotaging his employer\u2019s systems\u201d. By early August 2019, he introduced malware that crashed systems and prevented other users from logging in.\n\nCourt documents also revealed he created \u201cinfinite loops\u201d that crashed servers, deleted coworker profile files, and ultimately built a \u201ckill switch\u201d that would lock out all users if his access to Active Directory was revoked. In early September 2019 he was asked to surrender his laptop, after which the kill switch was triggered.\n\nHundreds of thousands of dollars in damages\n\nInvestigators found plenty of incriminating evidence on that laptop, including that on the day he turned his device in - he deleted encrypted data.\n\nAn analysis of his search history showed he was looking for ways to escalate privileges, hide processes, and quickly delete files. Finally, the kill switch code was named IsDLEnabledinAD, short for \u201cIs Davis Lu enabled in Active Directory\u201d.\n\nA month after the malware ran, Lu was arrested, and later stood trial in front of the jury.\n\nDuring the trial, it was shown that Lu\u2019s employer suffered \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars\u201d in losses, as a direct consequence of his actions. Now, Lu will spend four years in prison, with an additional three years of supervised release.\n\n\"The FBI works relentlessly every day to ensure that cyber actors who deploy malicious code and harm American businesses face the consequences of their actions,\u201d said Assistant Director Brett Leatherman of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division.\n\n\u201cI am proud of the FBI cyber team\u2019s work which led to today\u2019s sentencing and hope it sends a strong message to others who may consider engaging in similar unlawful activities. This case also underscores the importance of identifying insider threats early and highlights the need for proactive engagement with your local FBI field office to mitigate risks and prevent further harm.\u201d\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 British Museum forced to partly close following cyberattack by ex-worker\n\u2022 Take a look at our guide to the best authenticator app\n\u2022 We've rounded up the best password managers",

NordLayer\u2019s Threat Protection delivers comprehensive defense with real-time scanning, DNS filtering, and Deep Packet Inspection.

Benedict updates and maintains a wide ranging collection of security guides on everything from Antivirus to ZTNA.\nThe Best Malware Removal of 2025 in Full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best malware removal overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMalwarebytes is updated daily, so you can trust it to identify and remove new threats the minute they appear.\nThe first time you install Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, you\u2019re given a 14-day trial of the premium edition, which includes preventative tools like real-time scanning and specific protection from ransomware. After two weeks, it reverts to the basic free version. This has to be activated manually, but is still a top-notch security tool. We recommend running it at least once a week to check for any nasties that you haven't noticed, or if you notice that your web browser has suddenly started acting strangely (likely a result of adware).\nThe app also includes the Browser Guard extension (for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) that protects you from phishing scams, blocks annoying ads, and tracker and more. It\u2019ll also review the security settings of your operating system, and can check if credentials associated with your email address have been leaked as part of a known data breach.. Malwarebytes Premium starts at $7/year for the personal edition, and goes all the way up to $ 799.99/year for protecting 20 devices.\nMalwarebytes also offers AdwCleaner, which targets and removes annoying programs that hijack your browser by changing your homepage, resetting your default search engine, or adding unwanted toolbars. It\u2019s also available for free, and along with Anti-Malware, is a great addition to your security toolkit.\nRead our full Malwarebytes Anti-Malware review.\nBest malware removal for detection rates\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAvast offers one of the most competent internet protection suites out there. While the company is famous for providing free antivirus software, it's worth noting that this now comes bundled with an anti-malware feature that uses behavioral monitoring to spot rogue programs.\nWhat's even better is that not only are Avast's basic products free, but they are also available for mobile devices as well as for desktops, which makes Avast a particular ideal choice if you have multiple devices you need to check. The app can also optionally install the free Avast Secure Browser with built-in protection from online ads, phishing scams, and more.\nWhile the basic Avast service is second-to-none, the company also provides paid-for anti-malware software that includes things, such as fine-tuning your PC to run better, to anti-ransomware software and secure file shredding.\nFor business users, there are paid-for internet security options to cover a range of needs and options.\nFor home users, though, the Avast free antivirus should keep your PC very well protected, though do note you'll be periodically prompted to update for one of Avast's other services.\nBoth the Premium (phishing protection, and more) and Ultimate (VPN, and more) versions can protect up to 10 devices. They cost $69.48 the first year, following which Premium renews at $99.99/year and Ultimate at $139.99/year.\nRead our full Avast antivirus review.\nBest malware removal for money value\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTrend Micro Antivirus+ Security is a very capable package that's easy to use with above average anti-spam and an effective \u2018Folder Shield\u2019 module to block ransomware. And, it seems to get better as time goes on.\nHow good is it exactly? The top testing labs all rate it highly for protection, even though there\u2019s a bit of disagreement on the details. In particular, AV-Comparatives says it gives a high number of false positives, which could be a real nuisance. On the other hand, AV-Test reports high levels of accuracy and no issues with false positives at all.\nOur experiences with the product is that protection levels look similar to Bitdefender, false positives are only marginally higher, and the system itself doesn't slow down our system noticeably more than anything else.\nStandout features include ransomware protection, advanced AI learning, email scam safeguarding, and Pay Guard to protect financial transactions. It costs $19.95/year for one Windows computer. The app also includes a free browser extension (for Chrome, Edge, Firefox) that can block ads, protects against phishing attacks, and more.\nWe'd recommend running the trial for its full 30 days before you buy, then, to see if you notice any problems. But if you're unaffected, its high levels of detection and excellent bonus features make Trend Micro a good choice.\nRead our full Trend Micro Antivirus+ Security review.\nBest malware removal for ease of use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nF-Secure Internet Security is a great collection of antivirus tools, and while it's a bit pricier than some of the other antivirus software on this best of list, the number of features you get certainly makes that high price tag worthwhile.\nWith F-Secure Internet Security, you get the brilliant antivirus software from F-Secure, alongside banking protection for safe online shopping, a password manager, an unlimited VPN, and a device finder that lets you track your lost Android or iOS device, and if needs be, remotely lock or wipe it as well.\nThe package typically receives maximum marks for protection from AV-Test, and generally scores highly with AV-Comparatives. They also say it can generate significantly more false positives than most of the competition, but how that affects you will vary depending on how you use your computer.\nThe interface is a major advantage, as it's extremely easy to use, lightweight, and for the most part, you can just leave the app to work alone looking after your PC. The program has minimal effect on your system performance, and if you do need to intervene, you can generally solve any issues in a couple of clicks.\nAvailable for Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, F-Secure Internet Security remains an appealing package: fast, lightweight, and able to run alongside many other security tools without conflict. Standout features include banking protection, and ransomware protection.\nF-Secure Internet Security costs $49.99/year for one device, or $89.99 for two years. To protect three devices, you\u2019ll need to pay $64.99/year, or $114.99 for two years. Similarly, for up to five devices, the app costs $69.99/year or $124.99 for two years. Helpfully, there\u2019s a 30-day free trial to help you explore all the nooks and crannies of the app.\nRead our full F-Secure review.\nBest free malware removal\nBest free malware removal overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBitdefender Antivirus Free Edition is a straightforward security tool that offers essential protection without the complexity or clutter of a full security suite. Designed primarily for Windows users, you can use the free edition to protect up to three devices.\nThe app is very user friendly as it has a minimalistic interface, and an efficient background scanning engine. In fact, simplicity is one of Bitdefender Free\u2019s strengths. The interface is clean and the software requires little to no user intervention after installation. It scans files automatically, blocks suspicious activity in real time, and keeps out of the way unless a threat is detected.\nIn terms of malware protection, the free edition performs well since it shares the same core technology and signatures found in Bitdefender\u2019s paid products, which is a definite plus.\nOn the downside, the free edition doesn\u2019t have features, such as a firewall, a VPN, ransomware file recovery, secure browsing tools, and more, which are reserved for Bitdefender\u2019s paid products.\nOverall, Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition is a strong option for anyone who wants a set-it-and-forget-it style antivirus with solid malware protection and minimal hassle, backed by a trusted name in the antivirus market.\nRead our full Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition review.\nBest free malware removal for feature variety\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Avira Free Security Suite provides one of the most comprehensive free security packages available on the internet.\nAs well as providing the standard anti-virus protection, the Avira Free security suite also provides a software updater, as well as scanning your network for vulnerabilities and helps you fix them.\nThere are also safe browsing and safe shopping options, as well as a system optimizer to speed up your PC which is normally charged for in other packages.\nIf that's not enough, there's also a free VPN included for up to 500 MB per month, as well as a password manager (although we recommend using the best password manager for more advanced features) and privacy settings manager.\nHowever, you actually have a choice of which features you want to install. This is a great plus as while the Avira suite is generous some users may want to run one or more features through a different suite.\nThere is an upgrade option, of course, but this is priced toward installation across 5, or 25 devices, and involves such features such as removing the VPN limit.\nIf there's one negative, it's that there's no anti-ransomware protection, but aside from that the Avira Free Security Suite is a very generous package indeed.\nRead our full Avira antivirus review.\nBest free malware removal for configuration\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBacked by Avast, AVG Antivirus Free blends strong malware detection with a sleek, approachable interface that caters well to non-technical users. The app provides real-time protection against viruses, and other forms of malware.\nScans are reasonably fast, and it offers several of these including deep scans, USB scans, and performance scans. The performance scan though mainly functions as a teaser for its paid cleanup tool as many of the fixes it suggests require upgrading.\nAVG also includes web and email protection. It blocks dangerous links in browsers, warns about unsafe websites, and scans incoming and outgoing emails for malware.\nThe paid-for Pro model has more security options - it has more robust download protection, offers data encryption and includes a firewall - but the free version offers decent protection for most PC users. Most importantly though since AVG and Avast share backend technology, choosing between them often comes down to personal preference.\nRead our full AVG Antivirus Free review.\nBest free malware removal for portability\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMost security software tries to stop malware and spyware getting onto your system. Emsisoft Emergency Kit doesn't: it's the 911 call of security software, the app you use when your PC's been poked by something unpleasant.\nUnlike traditional antivirus programs that run continuously in the background, Emsisoft Emergency Kit is entirely portable. The installation process actually just uncompressed it to a folder, which can be either on the local disk, or a portable USB one. Then you run the scanner manually. This makes the app especially useful for cleaning computers that are already compromised or sluggish due to malware.\nThe interface is minimal and utilitarian, and provides Quick, Malware, and Custom scan options. Once a scan is complete, you can quarantine or delete the detected threats.\nHowever, because it lacks real-time protection, scheduled scans, or automatic updates, the Emergency Kit is not a replacement for a primary antivirus solution. It also requires users to manually update the malware definitions, which can be a limitation if you're using it offline.\nRead our full Emsisoft Emergency Kit review.\nBest free malware removal for ease of use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSpybot Search & Destroy Free Edition is a long-standing anti-malware tool that specializes in detecting spyware, adware, and other privacy-invasive threats. A popular option in the early 2000s, Spybot has since evolved to include broader protection tools, though its core functionality in the free version remains focused on manual detection and removal of malware.\nThe Free Edition of Spybot is intended as a supplement to your main antivirus program, rather than a complete security solution. It doesn\u2019t offer real-time protection, automatic updates, or full antivirus capabilities. These capabilities are reserved for its paid versions.\nWhen you install the program for the first time, it asks you whether you want to manually adjust the settings or let the software automatically configure its settings. This flexibility is great for both beginners and experienced users.\nOne of its signature features, the Immunization module, modifies browser settings to prevent your system from accessing thousands of malicious or tracking websites.\nNote however that the last stable release of the app was back in 2021, and though there have been several incremental releases since, Spybot Search and Destroy isn\u2019t as regularly updated as its peers.\nRead our full Spybot Search & Destroy review.\nWe've also reviewed the best photo storage and sharing sites and the best free backup software.\nHonorable mentions\nThere are many vendors offering solutions to keep cyberattackers at bay, so that means there are a plethora of malware removal services to choose from. With that in mind, we took a look at many more tools than the ones listed above.\nHere are a few other honorable mentions that we tested and are worth considering:\n- ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware: Malware comes in many forms and ransomware is one of the most devastating. ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware focuses on this particular problem, detecting and eliminating ransomware attacks. It was even able to restore some of our files affected by ransomware during the detection period.\n- Webroot SecureAnywhere AntiVirus: One of Webroot's major strengths is its size. It consumes hardly any system resources because it is primarily cloud-based. Webroot monitors unknown programs, virtualizes their actions so they can\u2019t make permanent changes and decides based on that whether it's malware or not.\n- ESET NOD32: This may not be the cheapest malware removal tool on the market, nor the most user-friendly, but we did find that it delivered excellent detection results. It also works across multiple devices, with the Security Home Essential plan (starting at $59.99/year) allowing you to protect three devices per account.\n- Fortect: Although primarily a PC optimizer, Fortect also does a pretty good job at removing malware. It searches for and removes malware slowing your computer down and can even alert users if malware appears in newly downloaded files in real-time.\nBest malware removal FAQs\nWhat is malware removal?\nMalware refers to any software that is designed to disrupt the operations of your computer. It could cause many negative effects such as depriving you of access to information, leaking sensitive information to a third party, or causing your device to be unusable in its entirety.\nMalware removal is the process that scans your device to detect any malware and eliminate anyone that is found. There are specific software programs built for this process, and they make use of various processes to detect malware. Most software look for malware by checking for the signature of a known malware program on your device; the companies behind these tools have large databases of these signatures that their software runs checks against. The malware removal program scans all files on your device to detect the presence of any known signatures.\nLately, malware removal programs are also employing artificial intelligence and machine learning to fish out malware, especially the type that may get past the usual process.\nHow do I remove malware from my computer?\nThere are many guides for dealing with specific types of malware, so if you know what kind of specific malware you have, there are some handy guides on how to remove malware from your computer.\nThe easiest way, of course, is to use one of the services on our guide as they do all the hard work for you. If you're wondering how malware removal works, they often check a list of known malware variants and their likely hiding places within your system. When they conduct a scan, they will check all of the nooks and crannies that are the chosen habitats for even the most elusive of malware, and then place them in to quarantine to stop the infection.\nWhile hindsight is 20-20, the first line of defense for your device should be an antivirus service that can stop infections from happening. For example, they will warn you of malicious files hidden in downloads or email attachments.\nIs free malware removal good enough?\nFree malware removal is good for one time infections, however it is worth bearing in mind that if you've been infected once, it can always happen again. That's why having a malware removal service on hand is the best course of action. So is free malware removal worth it?\nEvery second spent trying to download another service to remove malware from your device is another potentially second spent by an attacker inside your files, photos, and personal information. Plus, paid services come with added features such as real-time scanning and protection to prevent an infection from happening in the first place.\nAnother bonus of premium malware removal services is that some will even scan your system for potentially unwanted programs that could be running in the background and slowing down your device without you knowing.\nWhat are the signs that my device is infected with malware?\nThere are several key signs that your device could be infected with malware.\nSome are fairly subtle, such as your device being slower than usual or your battery draining more quickly. Other signs that could indicate an infection include an abnormal level of data usage or the appearance of apps, browser extensions, or search engines that you don't remember installing.\nPrograms could be stuttering or crashing altogether or causing your device to overheat in normal use. You may also find than your usual security software is missing or disabled and you are locked out of your administrator account.\nThe best way to know for sure is to install a malware removal program and scanning for viruses.\nHow can I continue to keep my device secure after malware removal?\nAfter you have removed a virus, you are still just as susceptible to infection as you were before unless you use an antivirus program. There are numerous choices, such as the premium options we've ranked and reviewed in our guide to the best antivirus software, or the budget-friendly free antivirus.\nA device without any protection will be quickly infected again, as hackers use automated programs to distribute their viruses wherever they can.\nWhat does real-time scanning do?\nReal-time scanning checks common places that viruses could lurk to make sure no modifications or unwanted files have suddenly appeared.\nReal-time scanning will also check each of the files you download from the internet to check for malicious code or software hidden in otherwise legitimate downloads.\nOutside of real-time scanning, many malware removal tools and antivirus software will offer a 'deep scan' function that will check every single file on your device for malware.\nHow is malware removal different from antivirus software?\nMalware removal differs from antivirus software in several key ways.\nFirstly, malware removal is a tool most commonly used after a device has been infected to find the malicious file, isolate it, and remove it while restoring access to your device. Antivirus on the other hand is used to prevent infection in the first place.\nSecondly, malware removal sometimes doesn't offer scanning capabilities. Antivirus software will often check downloads and other online files for harmful software that could damage your device.\nFinally, malware removal is often a standalone tool, whereas antivirus software will often include a complete suite of security tools including a VPN, firewall, malware removal, antivirus, password manager, and parental control in one handy package.\nHow to choose the best malware removal tool for you\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Paid or free? | Trial period | Compatibility |\n|---|---|---|---|\nMalwarebytes | Paid | 14 days | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nAvast | Paid | 30 days | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nTrend Micro Antivirus+ Security | Paid | 30 days | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nF-Secure SAFE | Paid | 30 days | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nBitdefender Antivirus Free | Free | N/A | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nAvira Free Security | Free | N/A | Windows, macOS |\nAVG Antivirus Free | Free | N/A | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nEmsisoft Emergency Kit | Free | N/A | Windows only |\nSpyBot Search & Destroy | Free | N/A | Windows only |\nOur key buying criteria\nBudget\nMalware removal tools come in different grades. Some are free while others cost money. Among the paid ones, some are more expensive than others. Ensure you pick one that suits your budget.\nFor example, if you\u2019re a student with a tight budget, there are many free or affordable malware programs you can choose from. On the other hand, if you\u2019re a corporate worker entitled to a considerable security budget, it\u2019s wise to pick more expensive and sophisticated software. It\u2019s even more important for the latter because you might be handling sensitive data that\u2019s worth a lot to your employer; being infected by malware can cause considerable damage for corporate employees, so it\u2019s worth it to invest in a good removal program.\nEffectiveness\nA good malware removal tool should be able to detect and remove threats on your device with speed and accuracy. We don\u2019t advise this, but it\u2019s possible to test the program by deliberately infecting an unused computer with malware and seeing how good it is at identifying it. You can load many malware samples and measure how quickly each program you\u2019re testing identifies and removes the samples. Look out for important statistics like the number of files it caught and how well the program could recover a device after an infection. Another key metric is the CPU load of the software; does it consume considerable resources and slow down your computer?\nExtra Features\nMany malware removal programs include extra features to entice users. For example, some include a VPN service (virtual private network) that lets you surf the web privately and anonymously. You may also find a password manager to help you manage your online accounts or a tool that monitors the dark web for leaked credentials and reports back to you if your credentials have been compromised. Either way, it's preferable to choose a program that offers extra features than those that do not. This way, you may not have to pay separately for a VPN, password manager, etc.\nEase of Use\nIt's important for any cybersecurity program to be easy to use. Most users aren\u2019t technical people, so you must not be tech-savvy to know how to navigate your way around the program. When testing a program, try to cover all its features and see if you found it easy to navigate. If not, the program could give you problems in the future. Bitdefender was the most user-friendly out of the programs we tested, and you\u2019ll likely find it easy to use.\nCustomer Support\nThings can go wrong at any time, and you should be able to contact someone for help if that happens. A lot of cybersecurity programs have customer support teams that you can contact through email, telephone, and live chat. If you have the time, you can test multiple programs to measure their response times to support inquiries.\nNote that customer support is usually reserved for paid users which makes sense because support reps cost money to train and employ. If you\u2019re a free user, you\u2019ll likely only have access to FAQs, forums, and online communities for support, which can be also valuable.\nHow we test\nTo test for the best malware removal we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service.\nWe then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nWe also referenced how well each platform scored for malware detection, and also for false positives.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nTested by\nMike is a lead security reviewer at Future, where he stress-tests VPNs, antivirus and more to find out which services are sure to keep you safe, and which are best avoided.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

Lu unwisely responded to that setback by installing a \"kill switch\" that would activate if the company revoked his network access.\nThe package was a Java program that generated increasing numbers of non-terminating threads in an infinite loop that would eventually use enough resources to crash the server.\n\"The defendant breached his employer\u2019s trust by using his access and technical knowledge to sabotage company networks, wreaking havoc and causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses for a US company,\" said acting assistant Attorney General Matthew Galeotti of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division in an email. \"However, the defendant\u2019s technical savvy and subterfuge did not save him from the consequences of his actions.\"\nNot that he had much technical savvy. Lu labeled his malware IsDLEnabledinAD\n, for \"Is Davis Lu enabled in Active Directory.\" Furthermore, after developing the software he uploaded it using his corporate credentials \u2013 hardly clean OPSEC, to quote the US Defense Secretary.\nEaton terminated Lu\u2019s position on September 9, 2019, and cut off his network access, which caused the Java program to fire up, overloading the network, preventing login access for thousands of Eaton's global staff, and deleting some corporate data.\nBut when it came time for Lu to turn in his corporate laptop, it turned out he'd been using it to execute his plan. His search history showed he'd been looking up how to delete data, escalate privileges, and conceal process trails. He also deleted a large chunk of encrypted data.\n- Ex-school IT admin binned student, staff accounts and trashed phone system\n- Holy smokes! Ex-IT admin gets two years prison for trashing Army chaplains' servers\n- US military battling cyber threats from within and without\n- The choice: Pay BT megabucks, or do something a bit illegal. OK, that's no choice\nLess than a month after his malware ran, federal agents arrested Lu. He admitted to his crime but still opted for a jury trial. That didn't work out so well for him, and a federal jury in Cleveland found him guilty of intentionally damaging a protected computer. On Thursday he received a four-year sentence and an additional three years of supervised release.\n\"I am proud of the FBI cyber team\u2019s work which led to today\u2019s sentencing and hope it sends a strong message to others who may consider engaging in similar unlawful activities,\" said assistant director Brett Leatherman of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. \"This case also underscores the importance of identifying insider threats early.\"\nAs The Register has pointed out time and time again, insiders can cause the most damage with ease.

      "text": "Best Authenticator App for 2025: Features and Security Reviewed and Compared\nAdd an extra layer of online security with the best authenticator app\nAuthenticator apps are security tools that enhance the security of your online accounts. They work by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA), which adds an extra layer of verification beyond just a username and password. Since passwords alone can be easily stolen, guessed, or leaked in data breaches, authenticator apps help ensure that even if someone has your login credentials, they still can\u2019t access your account without a second form of authentication.\nAuthenticator apps typically work by generating time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs), which are unique codes that refresh every 30 seconds. When you log in to an account protected by 2FA, you'll be prompted to enter the current code displayed in your authenticator app. Because the code changes constantly and is tied to your device, it\u2019s virtually impossible for a hacker to guess. In some cases, authenticator apps can also send push notifications that you simply approve to confirm your identity.\nMany authenticator apps go a step further by offering biometric verification, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to open the app or to approve a login request. This adds another layer of protection, ensuring that even if someone has access to your device, they still can\u2019t bypass authentication without your physical presence. Overall, authenticator apps provide a simple yet powerful way to safeguard your digital identity and reduce the risk of account takeovers.\nOur security experts have been testing and evaluating authenticator apps for years, looking at how each one verifies your identity, its compatibility across devices and platforms, adherence to security and compliance standards, overall usability, and the range of additional security features it offers.\nWe've also listed the best security keys and the best password managers.\nReader Offer: Save 61% on NordPass for Business\nNordPass provides an easy-to-use and highly secure solution that most businesses will love, according to Techradar editors. Plans start at less than $1.79 per user per month - plus get 3 months extra.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nThe best authenticator apps of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest authenticator app overall\n1. Authenticator App by 2Stable\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Authenticator App by 2Stable delivers a robust suite of features for users who value both privacy and convenience.\nOne area where the app excels is in secure cloud sync, which works through iCloud. This helps sync your 2FA codes across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, and even your Apple Watch. For users embedded in the Apple ecosystem, this significantly enhances the user experience. It also includes biometric authentication features adding yet another layer of protection.\nWe also like the app\u2019s backup and restore functionality that stores 2FA tokens in an encrypted format, which helps reduce the risk of being locked out if you change or lose your device.\nOther thoughtful touches include Apple Watch support, widgets for quick access, multiple import options, the ability to use the app without creating an account, and a lot more.\nThe app\u2019s biggest limitation is that it isn\u2019t available on Android devices, though the developers claim this is in the works. The $50 annual price tag could be another hindrance for many, though the app offers a feature-restricted free version that can manage two accounts.\nAll things considered, 2Stable\u2019s Authenticator app is best suited for users who view security and convenience as equally important, and don\u2019t mind paying a premium for both.\nBest authenticator app for security\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDeveloped by the makers of NordVPN, NordPass Authenticator benefits from the company\u2019s established reputation in digital security. That said, NordPass Authenticator isn\u2019t a general-purpose authenticator app. Instead the app is built for companies that already rely on NordPass Business for their password management needs.\nUsing NordPass Authenticator saves NordPass Business users the effort to copy codes from a separate app, as it allows all your employees to generate and use TOTP codes directly within the NordPass Business vault. This simplifies the login process for enterprise users and reduces friction in daily workflows.\nAlso, because it\u2019s part of the NordPass Business infrastructure, admins can enforce policies around 2FA usage, monitor access logs, and maintain visibility into how 2FA is being used within your organization. That level of control simply doesn\u2019t exist in standalone authenticator apps.\nOn the downside though, NordPass Authenticator lacks the robust backup and recovery features found in other authenticator apps. There\u2019s no option for cloud backups, like you get with 2Stable\u2019s authenticator app, nor the ability to restore your tokens on a new device. In the same vein, it also lacks any ability to sync tokens across multiple devices.\nNordPass Authenticator is bundled along with the NordPass Business product, plans for which start from $1.99/user/month when paid for a year, or $1.79/user/month when subscribed for two years.\nBest cross-platform authenticator app\n3. Authy\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAuthy is a popular 2FA app that\u2019s developed by Twilio. The app stands out for its ease of use and advanced features despite being available for free, and has a clean, responsive, and easy to navigate user interface.\nNot only does Authy support both Android and iOS, it also doesn\u2019t restrict you to a single device. Thanks to its multi-device sync you can access your 2FA tokens across your smartphones, and tablets.\nAlso, unlike many other apps in the genre, Authy offers more than just basic 2FA functionality. One of its most popular features is the encrypted cloud backup system. This helps you access your 2FA token even if you lose or replace your phone. You can also lock Authy behind a PIN, fingerprint, or facial recognition, which adds an extra layer of protection.\nYet, despite its strong feature set, Authy isn't without drawbacks. For starters, your Authy account is tied to your phone number. This makes you vulnerable to SIM swap attacks and also means you\u2019re sharing personal information with Twilio.\nAlso, once you\u2019ve set up 2FA tokens in Authy, moving them to another app isn't straightforward as there\u2019s no mechanism to export your data. So, if you ever want to switch to another authenticator, you\u2019ll have to laboriously first disable 2FA on each of your online accounts and then re-enable it using the new authenticator app.\nBest authenticator app for ease of use\n4. Google Authenticator\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMany folks have a love/hate relationship with Google and if you're in the latter category, you probably want to move on to the next option on this list. For everyone else, say hello to the easiest and most basic authenticator app on the planet.\nGoogle Authenticator has been around for over a decade, is free, and will work with virtually every service that supports TOTPs. The app is as streamlined as it gets. There are no bloated menus, and you don\u2019t need to set up an account to use the app.\nFor a long time that was the extent of Google Authenticator\u2019s capabilities. But the app has received significant updates in 2025. The biggest news for Google Authenticator users is the introduction of cloud syncing. You can now backup your codes to your Google account and sync it across all your devices, whether they're Android phones, iPhones, or iPads, as long as they are logged into the same Google account. The app now also has a Privacy Screen feature, which helps protect access with your device's screen lock, PIN, or fingerprint, and facial recognition.\nDespite the improvements, there are a few areas where it lags behind some of its peers. For instance, while there is a search facility to find specific accounts, you don\u2019t get any organization features that you get with some other apps like Authy. Also, Google Authenticator remains a mobile-only app, and while it does work on iOS devices as well, unlike Duo Mobile, it can only backup and sync to a Google account.\nBest authenticator app for enterprise\n5. Duo Mobile\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDeveloped by Cisco, Duo Mobile is best known for its use in corporate environments. Duo Mobile does more than just generate time-based TOTPs. It's built to work as part of a broader identity and access management system, but many of its core features make it a solid 2FA app even for personal use, especially since it\u2019s available for free.\nDuo Mobile works on Apple and Android phones, and tablets, as well as on smart watches. The app has a straightforward interface that makes it easy to manage multiple accounts.\nOne of the standout features of Duo Mobile is push-based approval. Instead of typing in a 6-digit code, supported services can send you a push notification on your phone when trying to log in. Simply tap \"Approve\" and you're in. It\u2019s fast, intuitive, and eliminates the need to manually input codes.\nThat said, the app also supports standard TOTP codes, so you can still use Duo Mobile to generate codes just like you would with other authenticator apps. The app also supports account recovery through secure cloud backups, via iCloud on iOS and Google Drive on Android.\nBut while you can back up and restore accounts, you can\u2019t actively sync the codes between devices like you can with Authy or 2Stable\u2019s Authenticator app. Similarly, Duo Mobile is a mobile-only app. So if you're looking to access your 2FA tokens from a computer or browser, you'll need to look elsewhere.\nBest authenticator app for LastPass users\n6. LastPass Authenticator\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLastPass Authenticator is a good enough 2FA app, but it works best as an add-on for LastPass password manager users, rather than as a top-tier general-purpose authenticator on its own.\nThe app has a clean, user-friendly interface, and the process to add, remove, and view tokens is pretty straightforward. Like most 2FA apps, LastPass Authenticator works with virtually any online service that supports TOTPs. The app also scores for supporting fingerprint, and PIN protections, which helps keep your tokens secure if someone gets access to your unlocked phone.\nThat said, while it works as a general 2FA app, many of its interesting features are tied to your LastPass account.\nFor instance, unlike some of its peers, like Authy, which allows real-time sync across multiple devices, LastPass Authenticator only backs up and restores tokens through your LastPass account.\nIt also supports push notification for login approval, but again only when paired with the LastPass password manager. While it works on both Android and iOS, the app is strictly mobile-only, and doesn\u2019t have a desktop or browser extension.\nAll things considered, while LastPass Authenticator is functional as a standalone 2FA app, it doesn\u2019t offer much for non-LastPass users.\nBest authenticator app for Microsoft users\n7. Microsoft Authenticator\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMicrosoft Authenticator is a good authenticator app, but it's primarily designed with Microsoft account users in mind. The app is available for both Android and iOS, works with any service that supports 2FA, and is fairly intuitive to use. It also offers a search function to sort through your 2FA accounts, which is helpful if you\u2019ve enabled it for several services.\nThe app also by default locks itself behind the device\u2019s biometric and PIN to add an extra layer of protection if someone gets access to your phone.\nAnd that\u2019s the extent of its non-Microsoft account linked features. The app offers an encrypted cloud backup of your 2FA tokens, but this is linked to your Microsoft Account, or iCloud for iOS users.\nAlso, if you use Microsoft services, you\u2019ll benefit from push-based logins that you can approve with a tap. Like many of its peers, Microsoft Authenticator too is a mobile-only app.\nFor a long time, Microsoft Authenticator has offered password autofill and even some basic password management functions. However, as of August 2025, these features are being deprecated to make the app a streamlined authenticator app, which further limits its appeal to non-Microsoft account users.\nBest authenticator app for Apple users\n8. Step Two\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nStep Two is a good authenticator app that\u2019s designed specifically for the Apple ecosystem. While it\u2019s not the most feature-rich authenticator out there, it offers a clean, distraction-free interface that works well across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. If you regularly use multiple Apple devices, Step Two ensures your codes are available on all of them without any manual setup.\nTokens are automatically and securely synced via iCloud. This means your 2FA tokens are always backed up and restored across devices tied to your Apple ID cutting out the risk of losing access to them if you upgrade your phone.\nYou can use the app for free to manage up to 10 accounts/services. For a one-time purchase of $10, you can use Step Two to handle any number of accounts.\nThe biggest drawback of the app is that it is made exclusively for Apple platforms. This means that if you ever switch to Android, there's no way for you to transfer your tokens from Step Two.\nThe app also falls short of 2Stable\u2019s authenticator app in terms of features. For starters, it only supports the Safari browser, unlike 2Stable\u2019s that supports all the best web browsers.\nAuthenticator app FAQs\nHow to choose the best authenticator apps\nWhen deciding which authenticator app to use, first consider what your actual needs are, as sometimes free and budget software may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a paid platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, higher-end software can really cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your authenticator app.\nHow do authenticator apps work?\nWithout fail, one of the easiest ways to begin using 2FA is by using your smartphone's camera and scanning a QR code provided by the company or website. Once you do, the authentication app gets to work by issuing an ever-changing unique code. That code is valid as the second form of identification for just a few seconds before the authentication app refreshes it.\nYou only have to scan the QR code once on a device. If you're using sync and backup (like many of the apps below), you probably won't have to scan a QR code during setup on another device. Otherwise, you will.\nThe codes are generated using a standard HMAC-Based One-Time Password (HOTP) algorithm developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). However, at no time does the IETF gain access to the codes.\nIs 2FA all the protection we need?\nWhen 2FA options first arrived, many thought online vulnerability would finally end in the tech world. But, unfortunately, that isn't the case. 2FA, like every other form of online security, isn't 100% secure. Try as they might, a hacker or two will figure out a way to gain access to something they shouldn't. In January 2022, for example, Crypto.com was attacked. Nearly 500 accounts were compromised, and the thieves made off with more than $31 million in cryptocurrencies.\nDespite its imperfections, 2FA still provides better protection than passwords alone.\nHow we tested the best authenticator apps\nTo test for the best authenticator apps we first set up an account with the relevant platform. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations.

      "text": "Best Password Manager of 2025: Reviews, Insights, Expert Recommendations\nNordPass, Dashlane, and RoboForm are excellent password managers that provide great features at a highly affordable price point\nIn a world full of constant cyber threats, password are the main point of entry for most cybercriminals.

The free tier is lacking somewhat, but the prices for the premium plans represent good value considering what you get.\nBest for security\nBest password manager for security\nAnother popular and well-loved password manager, Dashlane is keen to pitch its strong security credentials as a leading feature. While all the managers here have a good reputation in this regard, Dashlane also prides itself on its easy to use interface, so it isn't a chore to navigate.\nBest for mobile\nBest password manager for mobile\nRoboForm works great on mobile (both Android and iPhone), and the free version includes cloud syncing, which is a nice bone to be thrown. Multi-device syncing is for paid users only, though, but prices are good.\nLoad the next 7 products \u2193\nBest for free\nBest free password manager\nBitwarden\u2019s free tier alone should cater to most users\u2019 needs. Unless you\u2019re a serious power user who requires some very advanced features, it is more than capable of storing all your passwords securely across all your devices - all without paying a penny.\nBest for syncing and sharing\nBest password manager for syncing and sharing\nKeeper offers unlimited password storage with unlimited syncing and sharing across all of your accounts. It also includes some great features for businesses including GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC2 compliance, and granular admin controls too.\nBest for familes\nBest password manager for families\n1Password works well for families and businesses, with its sharing functionalities and some great security features that protect users from phishing and keylogging attacks.\nBest for privacy\nBest password manager for privacy\nBest known for its secure email service and VPN, Proton has now thrown its hat into the password management ring, and acquitted itself very well thus far. Its lack of pedigree in this area may deter some users, though.\nBest passwordless\nBest passwordless password manager\nOne of the notable features of this manager is the option to log in without a master password - you can use your fingerprint, a QR code or even a selfie instead. The overall package from LogMeOnce isn\u2019t bad either, making it a strong contender.\nBest for small business\nBest password manager for small business\nAs the name suggests, this is a solid password manager, but the price is high for what you get, and the lack of admin features makes this suitable only for small businesses. Individuals may look elsewhere.\nBest for Apple users\nBest password manager for Apple users\nA boon for Apple users, this password manager can integrate with iCloud and even has an app for Apple watch. Its sleek interface is right at home on the Cupertino giant\u2019s pristine devices too.\nThe best password managers of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest password manager overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want great performance: NordPass has a modern, intuitive interface and proved to have excellent performance in our testing. The app offers a seamless user experience.\n\u2705 You want it on every platform: NordPass has apps for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android, as well as extensions on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Brave, and Safari.\n\u274c You won\u2019t use it much: NordPass might offer too many features for casual single user that won't make use of the many additional features.\n\u274c You want one subscription for family and business: NordPass doesn't offer a combined plan for your business and family, so you'll have to buy them separately.\n\ud83d\udd12 NordPass is a great password manager option for many individuals, families, and organizations, thanks to its array of advanced features and professional interface. It might be a bit too much for the needs of some, though. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nThe vendors of one of the best VPN services around, NordVPN, have now made a password manager.\nNordPass Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Unlimited password storage\n\ud83d\udd35 Data breach scanning\n\ud83d\udd35 Free 30 day premium trial\n\ud83d\udd35 Email masking\n\ud83d\udd35 Secure credential sharing\n\ud83d\udd35 Login monitoring\nNordPass Usage:\nNordPass is best suited for individuals, families, and businesses of all sizes. The interface is modern, smooth, and well suited for both beginners and professionals.\nNordPass offers some of the best security features out of all the password managers we have tested. It is the only password manager to use xChaCha20 encryption which offers better performance over AES-256 bit encryption used by Dashlane and RoboForm.\nNordPass has also added the ability to store and manage passkeys, further improving its functionality in an age where passwords may soon be a thing of the past.\nWhile not as cheap as Bitwarden, NordPass is one of the most affordable options with all features included at a single price point.\nNordPass Plans & Pricing:\nUnlike some competitors such as Keeper and 1Password, NordPass offers a free tier which provides storage for an unlimited number of passwords. The one downside being that only one active session can be used at a time.\nThe premium plan offers the same features as the free tier, with password strength detection, credential leak monitoring, and trusted password sharing included at $1.89 per month.\nThe family plan allows six users to access all of the features offered on the free and premium plan, with the two year commitment at $2.79 per month. There are also NordPass promo codes to bring down the cost.\nIf you are looking for a business password manager that includes family access, 1Password would be better suited to your needs.\nRead our full NordPass review.\nBest password manager for security\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to prioritize security: Dashlane is one of the highest rated password managers for security, offering features such as real-time phishing alerts, dark web monitoring, a VPN, and secure notes storage.\n\u2705 You want a great user experience: Dashlane offers AI-powered autofill options to help you log in to your accounts faster, and offers syncing across all your devices.\n\u274c You're on a budget: With all its premium features, Dashlane doesn't exactly come cheap, and its miserly free version only lets you use a single device.\n\u274c You want extra 2FA options: Dashlane only offers two-factor authentication through the app, and doesn't offer SMS or biometric support (yet?).\n\ud83d\udd12 Dashlane is very close to its main rival NordPass, but it puts a bit more emphasis on security features. Its premium plans can be expensive, but it is one of the go-to choices for millions of users for a reason. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nDashlane's password manager is one of the best on the market, and has some top features for the security-conscious.\nDashlane Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 AI autofill\n\ud83d\udd35 Passkey support and storage\n\ud83d\udd35 Passwordless login\n\ud83d\udd35 Digital wallet\n\ud83d\udd35 VPN included\n\ud83d\udd35 Secure notes storage\nDashlane Usage:\nDashlane's user reviews pitch it as one of the best password managers for user experience with a very simple and intuitive interface across the apps and browser extensions, and other features aimed at making using the app as simple as possible.\nOur testing certainly supports this, with the sign up process being very simple, and the extension automatically offering to import passwords from web browsers and other password managers.\nThe security settings also set Dashlane apart from the competition, and while it uses the industry standard AES-256 encryption (unlike NordPass), it also provides users with in-app two-factor authentication and secure storage for payment information and notes. Dashlane also supports passkeys, which are fast becoming a more secure alternative to passwords.\nDashlane also includes a VPN in its premium plan. Other password managers such as NordPass require your to sign up for the more expensive NordVPN Plus plan to include both a VPN and password manager. This Nord plan is $6 per month for one year, compared to Dashlane's $5 for both a password manager and VPN, showing a significantly better value for money in this regard.\nIts important to note that Dashlane's 2FA is only supported in app, with no biometric or SMS support available which is a shame, and something I would like to see expanded in the future.\nDashlane Plans & Pricing:\nOverall, Dashlane is one of the more expensive options on the list, but it does offer a free plan that allows you to store up to 25 passwords on a single device, and provides secure password sharing. NordPass' free plan is a better option, as it provides unlimited password storage, multi-factor authentication including biometrics, and 24/7 live chat support.\nThe Dashlane Premium plan sits at $5 per month and gives you unlimited storage for passwords and passkeys across an unlimited number of devices. You also receive phishing alerts, dark web monitoring, and a VPN. For those looking to couple a password manager and VPN on one plan, Dashlane Premium offers superior value for money, but may be a bit expensive for those just wanting a password manager.\nThe Family plan is $7.50 per month and includes 10 accounts with all of the features in the Premium tier, but only the admin will have access to the VPN. Dashlane offers more accounts in its family plan than any other password manager, making it an excellent choice for large families.\nRead our full Dashlane review.\n\"Password managers manage all the complexity (of storing many passwords) behind one master password\" - JD Sharman, former CEO of Dashlane\nBest password manager for mobile\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want easy autofill: RoboForm has some great autofill capabilities, making it easy to complete login forms.\n\u2705 You want advanced 2FA: RoboForm's 2FA supports email, SMS, authenticator app, passkey, trusted device, and hardware security key authentication.\n\u274c You want free device syncing: Syncing your passwords between devices is one of the most basic functionalities all good password managers should have, but the free version of RoboForm omits this.\n\u274c You want a VPN included: Unlike some of the other password managers, RoboForm doesn't offer a VPN which I see as an essential in this day and age.\n\ud83d\udd12 RoboForm is a well-priced password manager that has great autofill and mobile functionality, but device syncing isn't available on the free version. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nRoboForm's pricing fills the gap between NordPass and Dashlane, but offers a superior 2FA app and mobile functionality.\nRoboForm Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Two-factor authenticator\n\ud83d\udd35 TOTP authenticator\n\ud83d\udd35 Breach & compromise monitoring\n\ud83d\udd35 Cloud backup\n\ud83d\udd35 Emergency access\n\ud83d\udd35 Local-only mode\nRoboForm Usage:\nRoboForm has some of the best multi-platform support I have seen from any password manager, working across Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux, and Chrome OS. But when it comes to mobile devices, RoboForm really shines.\nThe app allows you to automatically sync your data between the mobile apps and your browser, and includes highly granular control over accounts settings and privacy, which is particularly handy for those on the go.\nRoboForm's 2FA offers support across email, SMS, authenticator app, passkey, trusted device, hardware security key, making it far superior to Dashlane's 2FA app - plus, RoboForm's advanced authenticator is available even at the free tier. As an added bonus, RoboForm's free account will even notify you about your passwords it has detected in data breaches.\nOne issue with the RoboForm free tier is that you aren't able to access your password manager via the web or any other devices - something that NordPass' free tier allows you to do even if it is only one active session at a time. So if you're looking for a free web-based account, NordPass is probably the better option.\nAs for paid features, RoboForm Premium gives you data breach monitoring for 5 email accounts, a local only mode that means all your data is stored purely on your device and not on RoboForm's servers (very handy for the privacy-conscious). You can also securely share files and folders from the RoboForm app.\nRoboForm doesn't offer a VPN, which might be a sticking point for those looking for the ultimate password security package. However, you are already getting some decent features at a very attractive price point, which I'll discuss below.\nRoboForm Plans & Pricing:\nAs I mentioned, RoboForm offers a feature-rich free tier. But how much does a Premium account cost? RoboForm is very reasonable in its pricing, with the password manager currently available for $1.87 per month for the first year ($22.44).\nAt this price point, RoboForm is sandwiched between Dashlane and NordPass. You could opt for the cheaper pricing from NordPass and lose out on RoboForm's advanced 2FA and excellent mobile functionality, or opt for Dashlane's more expensive plan to grab a VPN. RoboForm therefore fills a niche between some of the best password managers.\nAlternatively, if you want accounts for whole household, the RoboForm Family plan is $2.98 for the first year ($35.76), which again places it firmly between NordPass and Dashlane's family pricing.\nOverall, RoboForm is definitely worth considering if you're constantly on the go and want advanced account settings control and need an advanced 2FA app.\nRead our full Roboform review.\nBest free password manager\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You don\u2019t want to pay anything: There isn\u2019t another password manager on the market that gives away so much without demanding any of your money.\n\u2705 You want open source software: Being open source means it can\u2019t really get away with hiding any major flaws or inconvenient truths.\n\u274c You value a slick interface above all else: Although its UI is perfectly usable, there are occasions where it isn't as seamless as we'd like.\n\ud83d\udd12 Bitwarden is absolutely stellar when it comes to value, giving away a very competent password manager with features that its rivals usually closet behind a paywall. Some minor UI issues are the only real drawbacks. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nBitwarden offers a feature rich and near-unbeatable free tier, ands its Premium plans are some of the cheapest around.\nBitwarden Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Exceptional free plan\n\ud83d\udd35 Self hosting options\n\ud83d\udd35 Breach monitoring\n\ud83d\udd35 Unlimited devices\n\ud83d\udd35 Passkey support\n\ud83d\udd35 Open-source\nBitwarden Usage:\nBitwarden really switches things up when it comes to password management. The free tier beats the offerings of NordPass and even rivals the paid plan, offering storage across an unlimited devices, breach monitoring, passkey support, email aliases, and even the option to self host on your own network.\nAdditionally, the free tier includes a password and username generator, payment and identity storage, free sharing with one other user, and the ability to securely export your data from the app.\nWhen it comes to the paid plans, things just keep getting better. Premium improves two-step login from the Hardware Security Key, Email, and Authenticator App included in the free tier by adding Yubico OTP to the mix. You also get a TOTP integrated authenticator, priority support, encrypted sharing for text and files, and a up to 1GB encrypted file attachment.\nIt would be nice to see even more added to the Premium line up, such as a VPN, but the pricing more than makes up for this.\nBitwarden Plans & Pricing:\nBitwarden's free plan is more than capable of offering everything you could need for password management, but if you do decide to upgrade, Bitwarden's Premium plan is one of the most cost effective around.\nThe Premium plan is $10 per year. Yes, $10. Less than $1 per month. Alternatively, you can opt for the Family plan, which includes 6 Bitwarden Premium accounts for less than the cost of a single Dashlane Premium account. The Family plan is $3.33 per month, or $40 for the year, and includes everything in the Premium tier, plus a family vault for securely storing and sharing important files and data.\nBitwarden is the top pick if you're looking for a free password manager, offering a feature set that beats some of the paid plans on this list.\nRead our full Bitwarden review.\nBest password manager for syncing and sharing\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want plenty of features: Keeper has a lot of features to get your hands on, making it a great choice for all users.\n\u2705 You want a customizable plan tailored to you: RoboForm's bolt-on business features make it great for customizing a plan that suits your needs.\n\u274c You want everything included: While great for customization, the add-on prices quickly mount up.\n\u274c You want a free option: True to its premium stylings, there is no free version of Keeper, only a free trial for 30 days.\n\ud83d\udd12 Keeper is a good pick for those looking for great password syncing and sharing options, and has plenty of features available. However, you do have to pay extra for those add-ons, and there isn't a free tier. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nKeeper offers some of the best syncing and storage options from any password manager, and some great business features too.\nKeeper Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Unlimited syncing and sharing\n\ud83d\udd35 Great security compliance\n\ud83d\udd35 Emergency access\n\ud83d\udd35 Identity and payment secure storage\n\ud83d\udd35 Autofill\n\ud83d\udd35 24/7 support\nKeeper Usage:\nKeeper has some excellent features that make it a highly intuitive and easy-to-use password manager. Firstly, login can be done quickly and securely thanks to Keeper's support for biometric authentication, meaning a simple facial scan or fingerprint can grant you access to your account.\nUnlimited is a word that you'll see frequently on the list of Keepers features. You get unlimited password storage across an unlimited number of devices, with unlimited syncing for passwords as well as your identity and payment information (which is super easy to autofill).\nUnfortunately, Keeper's list of included features is fairly short compared to other solutions in this guide. For example, if you want breach monitoring or a secure cloud backup, you're going to have to spend extra on top of Keeper's already fairly expensive pricing.\nKeeper's features are far better on the business side of things, with some highly customizable plans with excellent optional extras, great security compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2), and an admin dashboard that makes access management and security checks a breeze - but if you want to read more about that, you might want to check out the best business password managers.\nKeeper Plans & Pricing:\nKeeper doesn't offer a free plan, which is a shame considering many of Keeper's premium features can be accessed as part of the free plans from Bitwarden, NordPass and Roboform.\nCompared to the other password managers I've discussed, Keeper costs almost as much as Dashlane but without as many features. For example, Keeper is $4 per month for the first year ($47.99), but doesn't include a VPN, breach monitoring, or phishing alerts, making it a relatively expensive choice when you consider what you're missing. Even NordPass and RoboForm include breach monitoring for half the cost.\nThe Keeper Family plan improves things slightly with the inclusion of a 10GB cloud storage, 5 private vaults, and some control over sharing. But at $8.50 per month for the first year ($101.99), there are definitely more budget friendly options with a greater range of features to choose from.\nKeeper is definitely a better choice for business users than as a personal solution.\nRead our full Keeper Security review.\nBest password manager for families\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're a family: 1Password is great for family use, thanks to its sharing features.\n\u2705 You want good security: 1Password has a lot of useful security features, such as keylogging and phishing protection.\n\u274c You want a free password manager: 1Password is another manager that doesn't have any free options available.\n\u274c You want live chat support: 1Password only offers support through email, forum, and social media.\n\ud83d\udd12 1Password is another popular choice among the third-party password managers, with a good track record and useful features for families and the security conscious. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n1Password offers excellent family-friendly features at an affordable price point, making it the best password manager for families.\n1Password Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Credential strength checks\n\ud83d\udd35 Autosave + autofill\n\ud83d\udd35 Unlimited vaults (family plan)\n\ud83d\udd35 Admin dashboard (family plan)\n\ud83d\udd35 Third-party support\n\ud83d\udd35 Free 14 day trial\n1Password Usage:\n1Password can be accessed from across a very wide range of devices, platforms and browsers. Support is offered for macOS, iOS, watchOS, Windows, Android, and Linux, as well as the Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox, and Brave web browsers.\nDuring installation, there is a guided setup that will walk you through the steps to install 1Password on your chosen platform, making it very user friendly users, both new and experienced.\nAlmost everything you share or store through 1Password is protected by AES 256-bit encryption, with the option to add additional Two-Key Derivation for additional account security, and the option to use secure remote password (SRP) protocol to encrypt your data while in transit.\nOne unique feature 1Password offers compared to other providers is the ability to hide selected 1Password vaults while travelling or crossing borders, making it a particularly attractive option for journalists or other who regularly travel.\nNow, you may be wondering why you would opt for 1Password over Bitwarden's far cheaper family plan. This comes down to how much your care about security and privacy - Bitwarden's security tools are good, but 1Password provides far more control over the level of security and privacy you would like on your account.\nWhat makes 1Password particularly suited for families is how easy it is to use, and the guidance offered by 1Password along the way. While lacking a 24/7 live chat, 1Password does offer support through other channels, such as email and support forum.\nThe Family dashboard is also extremely helpful when managing accounts, with easy account recovery options. You can even share 1Password data securely with anyone, including those without a 1Password account. The pricing isn't anything to turn your nose up at either, as I'll discuss below.\n1Password Plans & Pricing:\nThe 1Password Premium plan is $35.88 for a year, working out at $2.99 a month - placing it in the middle of the road when compared to the likes of NordPass, Dashlane, and RoboForm. But the price is certainly worth it for the security features if you are that way inclined.\nAs for 1Password Families, you'll get 5 Premium accounts and an admin dashboard for $59.88 per year, or $4.99 per month, OR $1.39 per user per month, making it a very reasonably priced plan for families who will make full use of the five accounts.\nRead our full 1Password review.\nBest password manager for privacy\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 Privacy is a priority for you: Proton's track record in the online privacy market is second to none, and this focus has carried over into its password manager as well.\n\u2705 You don't want to pay anything: Like Bitwarden, Proton Pass has a very well-rounded free version, although Bitwarden has the edge in terms of features and pedigree.\n\u274c You want free breach monitoring: Proton Pass doesn't include breach or dark web monitoring at the free tier, reserving this feature for its paid plans.\n\u274c You're on a budget: Other options such as NordPass and Roboform beat Proton on price by quite some margin.\n\ud83d\udd12 Proton Pass is a very competent password manager, with some great features, including email aliasing and a 2FA authenticator. Although it is relatively new to the field, the company's ethos and reputation are reasons to be positive about this one. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nProton Pass has emerged as an excellent password manager over the passed two years, and seems determined to rival the top providers with better features and competitive pricine.\nProton Pass Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Swiss privacy laws\n\ud83d\udd35 Integrated 2FA\n\ud83d\udd35 Dark web monitoring\n\ud83d\udd35 Passkey support\n\ud83d\udd35 Proton Sentinel\n\ud83d\udd35 Custom email aliases\nProton Pass Usage:\nProton Pass is the newest password manager to grace this guide, produced by the privacy-gurus at Proton. You may have heard of some of Proton's other products, such as Proton VPN and Proton Mail. Just like their other offerings, Proton Pass is all about privacy.\nFirstly, as a Swiss-headquartered company, everything that passes through Proton's servers is protected by some of the strongest privacy legislation in the world. Secondly, Proton Pass uses 256-bit AES-GCM encryption for its vaults, meaning that only you can create new vault keys, and not even Proton can see them.\nProton offers a free tier that rivals even Bitwarden's solution, with automatic syncing across devices and browsers, 1GB encrypted storage, passkey support, unlimited logins, and 10 email aliases, plus access to all of the free features included in Proton's portfolio of other products.\nAs for Pass Plus, you get everything included at the free tier with an upgraded 10GB of storage, unlimited credit card storage, 50 vaults for organized storage, integrated 2FA, unlimited email aliases with custom domains, dark web monitoring, and access to Proton Sentinel (more on that below). Pass Family includes everything you see above across 6 user accounts with a shared 50GB encrypted storage.\nNow, the thing that makes Proton Pass the best password manager for privacy is the Proton Sentinel program. Sentinel was developed for people who frequently handle highly-sensitive data or comms, such as journalists, activists, executives. Sentinel enables additionals security protection, and adds strict challenges for suspicious login attempts, along with enhanced visibility into login attempts and account changes. Senintel is included in both the Plus and Family plan.\nProton Pass Plans & Pricing:\nProton Pass is another reasonably priced password manager that offers an excellent range of functionality and privacy features. Obviously, the free tier is a very strong contender for the best free password manager, but misses out to Bitwarden due to the lack of breach monitoring and self hosting options, but it is still a fantastic free product.\nOn to Proton Plus, which has a monthly cost of $2.99, or $35.88 per year, matching the premium pricings of 1Password, but costing slightly more than other providers such as NordPass and RoboForm. But as they say, privacy comes at a premium, and if privacy is what you want, Proton Pass is what you should get.\nThe Family plan is currently $4.99 per month, or $59.88 for the year, making it cheaper than Dashlane's single user plan and again matching 1Password's Family pricing. It's still unable to compete with the pricing offered by NordPass and Roboform, but that doesn't detract from the quality that Proton has managed to build in to its password manager in the last two years.\nRead our full Proton Pass review.\nBest password manager for small business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're a small business: With its good password sharing features, we think KeepSolid Passwarden would make a great choice for small teams.\n\u2705 You have a big family or lots of friends: Passwarden's family plan includes 7 premium accounts, making it perfect for busy households.\n\u274c You're not willing to spend: KeepSolid Passwarden is relatively expensive compared to the competition, so be warned.\n\u274c You're larger than a small team: With a lack of admin features, centralized management and SSO, KeepSolid Passwarden wouldn't really be suitable for large businesses or enterprises.\n\ud83d\udd12 KeepSolid Passwarden offers all the features you could want from a password manager if you're an individual, family, or small team, but if you're anything bigger, then this probably isn't for you. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nPasswarden offers an excellent family plan with great security features, making it a good budget alternative for SMBs looking for credential protection that doesn't break the bank.\nPasswarden Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Duress mode\n\ud83d\udd35 Security dashboard\n\ud83d\udd35 AES-256 and \u0415\u0421 \u0440-384 encryption\n\ud83d\udd35 2FA\n\ud83d\udd35 Offline mode\n\ud83d\udd35 Secure sharing\nPasswarden Usage:\nFirst and foremost, lets talk about a feature I don't think I've seen any other password manager include. For situations where someone may force you to open the app to steal your credentials, Passwarden offers a 'Duress' mode which is activated by entering a dedicated password that will hide any passwords or data that you choose to be hidden when Duress mode is activated.\nPasswarden also inlcudes a dedicated security dashboard that displays all the metrics and data you could possible want relating to your account. It will show weak, reused, and compromised passwords, and offer guidance on how to change them to be more secure. It also offers guidance on how to avoid falling prey to scams and fraud, and will notify you if it detects any of your personal info floating around on the dark web.\nAdditonally, Passwarden includes vault sharing that allows you to securely pass on important data, such as the Wi-Fi password or company credit card information, to other users without exposing that data to prying eyes thanks to 256-bit AES-GCM encryption.\nYou can also choose to protect your Passwarden account with 2FA that supports PINs, passwords, hardware tokens or authentication codes, and even biometrics.\nFor the personal plan, you will have a single account that supports usage across an unlimited number of devices that includes everything mentioned above, and more. The family plan includes 7 premium accounts, making it perfect for large families or small business teams.\nPasswarden Plans & Pricing:\nPasswarden is somewhat unique in its pricing structure. You can either do a monthly subscription that is billed annually, or pay a one time fee to gain access to a Passwarden lifetime license.\nFor the personal plan, the monthly cost is $1.66, or $19.92 per year, making it a fairly affordable choice compared to other more expensive alternatives such as Dashlane, Proton Pass, and even NordPass. Alternatively, you can pay the lifetime fee of $199.99 and never have to spend another penny.\nFor the family plan, the monthly cost is just $3.33 ($0.47 per account), or $39.96 per year, making it a close rival to some of the single account plans on this list, such as those offered by Dashlane and 1Password. The lifetime fee is $249.99, so if you are planning on using Passwarden for more than 6 years is probably worth the investment.\nRead our full Passwarden review.\nBest for Apple users\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're use Apple devices: mSecure offers iCloud syncing, and even has an Apple Watch app, making it a great choice for Apple fans.\n\u2705 You frequently forget passwords: mSecure not only includes auto-fill and a password generator, but can also show you your password history.\n\u274c You dont use Apple devices: mSecure doesn't offer full functionality for other devices that aren't part of the Apple ecosystem.\n\u274c You want a decent free tier: mSecure's free tier is very limited in its features, so you might be better placed turning to Bitwarden or Proton Pass for a free password manager.\n\ud83d\udd12 mSecure is a great password manager for Apple users, given its iCloud support and Apple Watch app. It also makes regular improvements to its service, based on what we've seen so far. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nmSecure offers great integrations and apps for Apple lovers, but it's free tier is slightly lacking.\nmSecure Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Password history\n\ud83d\udd35 Apple Watch app\n\ud83d\udd35 iCloud syncing\n\ud83d\udd35 Biometric authentication\n\ud83d\udd35 Securiy center\n\ud83d\udd35 Vault organization\nmSecure Usage:\nRight out of the gate, if you're looking for a free plan then mSecure is not the choice for you. However, if you're an Apple lover looking for integrations across all your devices with some great features, then this could be the password manager for you.\nThe free plan includes unlimited password storage - and thats it.\nmSecure is best used on Apple devices, as it has a dedicated Apple Watch app and can be set up to sync via iCloud. This is a double edged sword however, as mSecure doesn't offer the same levels of functionality across other platforms. In testing, we found mSecure's support for Windows and Android to be fairly laclustre.\nmSecure confusingly offers two paid tiers, an Essentials plan and and a Premium plan, with the only differences between the two being the inclusion of 2FA, secure file attachments, and some organizational and sharing options, with the difference in cost being less than $3 per year.\nmSecure does offer biometric authentication and a secure center that will helpfully point out weak or reused passwords, and will provide analysis on how best to secure your accounts.\nIf you're an organizational nut, mSecure makes a good case. With the Premium plan, you can apply custom tags, templates, images, filers and usernames to your vault data to help you sort and find what you're looking for faster.\nmSecure Plans & Pricing:\nOutside of the very basic free plan, mSecure has four paid tiers. The first two, Essentials and Premium, are basically the same apart from the differences pointed out above. Essentials is $1.66 per month when charged anually ($19.92), while the premium plan is $1.87 per month on the annual charge ($22.44).\nThe Family plan is $3.74 per month when charged annually ($44.88), and includes 5 Premium accounts with a basic admin dashboard. The Teams plan is $19.90 per month on the annual charge ($238.8), and includes 10 premium accounts with the option to add more for additional cost.\nRead our full mSecure review.\nBest passwordless password manager\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You don't want a master password: LogMeOnce lets you do away with a master password and instead just use your fingerprint, PIN, a QR code, or even a selfie.\n\u2705 You want excellent 2FA support: LogMeOnce supports Selfie-2FA, SMS Message, Voice Call, Email Message, Google Authenticator / TOTP, USB Flash Drive, X.509 Certificate, and YubiKey Security Key authentication.\n\u274c You dark web monitoring: LogMeOnce doesn't include dark web monitoring as standard in any of its plans, and you'll have to pay extra to get it.\n\u274c You're on a budget: Both the Professional and Ultimate plans are comparatively expensive to other solutions in this guide.\n\ud83d\udd12 LogMeOnce is a competent password manager that offers convenience in the form of passwordless access to your vault. Its lack of support for browsers outside the mainstream is the only real negative. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nLogMeOnce\nLogMeOnce Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Great 2FA and MFA support\n\ud83d\udd35 Beneficiary support\n\ud83d\udd35 Password tracking\n\ud83d\udd35 Emergency access options\n\ud83d\udd35 Login audit and activity tracker\n\ud83d\udd35 Unlimited devices\nLogMeOnce Usage:\nThere are two main talking points for LogMeOnce, the first being the passwordless login, and the second being the range of 2FA methods.\nLogMeOnce, as the name suggests, prides itself on not needing a master password, and offering numerous other secure login methods that are often quicker and easier than using a password.\nOn the 2FA side of things, LogMeOnce supports more authentication methods than any other password manager, providing authentication via Selfie-2FA, SMS Message, Voice Call, Email Message, Google Authenticator / TOTP, USB Flash Drive, X.509 Certificate, and YubiKey Security Keys.\nThe free account is fairly well featured, offering unlimited password storage, unlimited autofill, and unlimited syncing across devices. You also get three secure notes, three stored credit cards, and can send and recieve secure passwords a total of five times. The free tier also includes a password generator with a security score calculator, as well as security audits and 2FA through email and Google Authenticator.\nAs with mSecure, LogMeOnce also offers two tiers for its individual plan, Professional and Unlimited. Professional includes everything at the free tier, but bumps up the secure notes and secure sharing to 50 of each and adds unlimited credit card storing. You can also set a beneficiary for your apps and accounts, so that if you lose access you can have someone you trust maintain access to your accounts. The Professional plan also adds a few extra 2FA methods as well as MFA and some other nice-to-haves.\nThe Unlimited Plan includes all of this, but with unlimited secure notes and password sharing, access to all the 2FA methods, along with other security-oriented features such as remote logout, emergency access, and comprehensive security reporting. You also get access to priority email and live chat support.\nLogMeOnce Plans & Pricing:\nThe Professional plan is priced at $2.50 per month, making it a middle of the road option compared to other password managers in this guide. Ultimate will set you back $3.25 per month, and the family plan is $4.99 with 6 Premium accounts and a family dashboard included.\nIf you want to include dark web monitoring, which I would say is a fairly essential part of any password manager, you'll have to spend an extra $1.67 per month for the individual plans, or an extra $3.34 for the family plan, making it a comparatively expensive service.\nRead our full LogMeOnce review.\nD\u00e9sir\u00e9 has been musing and writing about technology during a career spanning four decades.

But the advantages of using one are quite clear.\nRather than being tied to the first-party managers offered by the likes of Apple and Google, using a standalone password manager means that you can access your credentials no matter what platform or device you are on.\nThey also give you the ability to organize your passwords how you like, by letting you create folders and grant different levels of access to certain items in your vault. Some come with additional tools, like a VPN in some cases, too.\nHow does a password manager work?\nA Password manager is a very simple and easy to use utility that requires minimal user interaction, since most of its actions are automated. They will work across numerous platforms, and they should feature a browser extension for use on desktop computers, as well as an app for smart devices such as your mobile phone. The passwords you use on each platform will synchronize across all the devices you use the password manager with.\nOnce you set up your password manager, you can go ahead and create whatever digital accounts you want. They will usually throw up a prompt to create a strong password for you when doing so - this is the password generation feature of the manager. Once you accept, it will then store the password and username for you in its vault, so when you next go to log in, you should find your credentials already filled out for you.\nIf you ever want to change or update your password for an existing account, you can do this too. Again, a prompt will usually appear from the password manager, confirming whether you want to overwrite the existing password with the new one you have created, ensuring your password manager remains up to date. Some password managers even have a version history, so you can see the previous passwords you have used.\nAs for importing your existing passwords stored on another manager, this should be a fairly straightforward process. Many managers will give you the option to import and export your passwords as a csv file, or any one that can be opened with spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. This allows you to export them out from your old manager and import them into your new one.\nIf you have your passwords stored manually in a spreadsheet, you can also import that into your new manager too, providing you follow the correct formatting for the manager in question.\nWhat are the most secure password managers?\nUnderstandably, this is one of the most important questions to ask of a password manager. You would expect any password manager worth its salt would be secure as a given, but no one is perfect and some have had issues. LastPass, for instance, although a very reputable and popular choice, did suffer a security breach, and although the company reassured users that no passwords were accessible, it is still a cause for concern.\nThe managers offered by big tech companies, mainly Google and Apple, are generally very secure, as you might expect. Not only do they have the pockets deep enough to maintain the best protection possible, it would also be a huge PR disaster should they incur any major breaches, and companies of that size have an awful lot to lose.\nHow safe are password managers?\nAll the best password managers are very safe, using the best encryption methods to store your passwords securely.\nZero-knowledge architecture is one of the core principles for managers to keep your passwords as safe as possible. This means that no one but the user has access to the passwords contained in the encrypted vault. Even the vendor and providers of the cloud backup service for your passwords are unable to see what your passwords actually are - only you have the power to decrypt your stored passwords, using your master password, or biometric data if you have this set up on supported password managers.\nComplex algorithms are used to encrypt passwords, and there are different methods. Some managers, such as NordPass, use something called XChaCha20, which is military grade and considered to be at the cutting edge of current encryption technology. It is also favored by big tech companies like Google, and is faster than more traditional methods such as AES-256.\nAlso, NordPass claims that such methods may be crackable with new technologies - for instance, quantum computing could put traditional methods of encryption at risk - but it believes XChaCha20 is resistant to these dangers.\nAll good password managers will also allow for biometric login and feature multi-factor authentication, two aspects which most people will be familiar with by now. The former involves technologies that recognize the physical aspects of the user, such as fingerprint scanners and facial recognition cameras, to authenticate them as the legitimate user.\nMulti-factor authentication is an added layer of security on top of your password to make sure that it\u2019s actually you who has entered your password on a given site or service, usually by sending a text message code on your phone that you have to input to make sure it is you. There are also separate authenticator apps you can have on your phone that give you a code to authenticate your login instead, if you\u2019d rather not receive an SMS code.\nAnd as with any piece of digital tech, how it is used by an individual or business goes a long way in determining how secure it remains. At the very least, make sure you are accessing your manager on a secure and protected network - always be cautious when using them in spaces with public wifi - and make sure you're using the best malware removal tools and the best antivirus software for your system.\nSmartphones are generally very secure in this regard, although you should always be careful when downloading apps to make sure they are trustworthy - the Google Play store, for instance, has had its fair share of malicious apps doing the rounds recently.\nAlso, if you are using a master password to secure your password vault, then make sure it is a strong one. This will be one that you will have to remember yourself, so a long and complex string of various random characters will probably be out of the question.\nCurrent expert advice suggests that for passwords you choose yourself, a string of three random words together is quite strong, as it will be hard to guess and easy to remember for yourself. Whatever you use, just make sure to avoid ones that are easy to crack, like your mother\u2019s maiden name, your birthday, or \u2018password1234\u2019.\nCan a password manager be hacked?\nIn a word: yes - in the sense that virtually any computer system can be hacked in theory. But the password managers in our list have a great safety record and utilize industry-standard encryption methods to protect your most valuable of assets. If we ever catch wind of any compromises to their security posture, we\u2019ll be sure to let you know straight away.\nOf course, many of you will probably be aware by now of the breach suffered by LastPass, one of the most popular password managers around, where users\u2019 password vaults were stolen. The company did assure them that they remained encrypted, so unless the hackers also guessed their master passwords too, they should remain safe. However, other personal data that were stolen, including names, payment information and the addresses of their IP, email and physical location, were not encrypted. For these reasons, LastPass no longer makes it onto our list of the best password managers.\nSpeaking of encryption, all good managers will use the strongest methods available when storing user passwords in their databases, which are extremely difficult to crack without the digital keys needed to unlock them. So the question then becomes can a hacker obtain these keys? In the case of LastPass, its subsidiary, GoTo, recently announced the encryption keys for its users\u2019 accounts were stolen in the same attack that affected the password manager, but it is yet to confirm whether the same is true for its service.\nLastPass isn\u2019t the only password manager to succumb to a breach, however. Many Norton LifeLock users had their accounts hacked in late 2022 via a credential stuffing attack, with the company warning them that unwarranted access to the suite\u2019s password manager may have occurred.\nPasswordstate also saw its users fall victim to a devious fake software update that stole their stored passwords. Unsurprisingly, none of these password managers made it onto our list.\nShould you use your browser to manage your passwords?\nIt of course makes sense from a convenience perspective to use your browser\u2019s integrated password manager, such as that in Google Chrome. And although it is a perfectly solid choice, there are various reasons why you may want a dedicated password manager instead or in addition to your browser\u2019s.\nFirstly, your browser\u2019s password manager will likely not work with other devices quite so easily.\nIf you use Google Chrome on a desktop and have an iPhone, then passwords associated with apps will not be saved to the manager in Chrome - by default they will be saved to Apple\u2019s own password manager, Keychain. Keychain and Chrome password managers will not sync together, and there is no browser extension for Keychain that will work on Chrome. Therefore, you will be running two managers concurrently, one used for mobile app passwords, and the other for website passwords. If you have an account for a service that has both a website and an app, then they will be saved to both managers separately.\nAs you can imagine, things can start to get messy and disorganized fast. The solution would be to have a dedicated, third-party manager like those on this list, so they can centralize and sync all your passwords for both websites and apps across all your devices. They will usually have an app for mobile and for desktop, as well as an integrated extension compatible with most common web browsers, so no matter what platform you\u2019re on, you\u2019ll always have access to your passwords.\nSecondly, dedicated password managers often come with a lot more useful extras. For instance, a small but useful feature of many password managers is the ability to give a nickname to your account passwords, so you can locate them easily. Sometimes, you will find that searching for your account credentials by username or by the URL that the account is stored on may not yield the results you're looking for.\nWhere to find the password manager on Chrome\nGoogle Chrome is the most popular web browser in the world right now, so there\u2019s a good chance you're using its integrated password manager already.\nOn desktop platforms, you\u2019ll find it under settings - autofill - password manager. You can see all your passwords here, and search for them via their username or the web page they are used on. It will also show you any passwords that have been compromised, based on known data breaches and leaks.\nThere is also the Google Password manager, which is the official password manager for Android, and has now taken over the integrated manager in Chrome as well. This means it now stores passwords you use on Android apps as well, not just website passwords.\nDo password managers work with apps?\nAll the best password managers will have an app associated with them, and will work on both Android and Apple iOS devices. This means that passwords you use for other apps will be able to be stored in your password manager and easily accessible on your device, allowing for instant login.\nThey will be cross-platform, so can be used across all your different devices, as well as having an extension you can download to allow them to work in popular browsers, such as Google Chrome and Apple's Safari.\nHowever, as many smart devices now have biometric login capabilities, such as using fingerprint scanners and facial recognition, a lot of apps will simply require this to log in instead, without the need to input a password every time. This biometric data is stored on the device itself, such as your iPhone or Android phone, so a password manager isn\u2019t used in these cases.\nHowever, many password managers now support biometric data too, so you can save it to the manager as well.\nHow to choose the top password managers\nChoosing the best password manager comes down to your personal needs, and whether others will be using it in addition to yourself, such as your family or the rest of your business.\nThe top two on our list, NordPass and Dashlane, are arguably the best all-round password managers available, more than capable of servicing anyone from single users to large organizations. But if you don\u2019t want to pay a penny for a password manager, then there\u2019s only one choice in our view: Bitwarden.\nHere are some key considerations when choosing a password manager:\n1. Security: This is of course one of the most important aspects of any password manager. We have done our best to check every manager featured in this guide adheres to best practices in terms of securing your vault and personal data.\nThey will use industry standard encryption methods to ensure that no one knows what your passwords are. Some will also offer biometric login in addition to or instead of a master password, and many will also offer two-factor authentication (2FA) to help prevent hackers accessing your account if they somehow manage to steal your master password.\nMany are also starting to support passkeys as a way of logging in too, which are thought to be both easier and more secure than using a master password.\n2. Synchronization: Although many other vendors will offer free versions of their managers, be aware that oftentimes, some fairly basic features will be omitted, such as cross-platform synchronization and unlimited storage and devices. Bitwarden does include these, though.\n3. Compatibility: We\u2019ve also indicated what platforms and browsers each manager is compatible with, which is another very important consideration when choosing a password manager. In fact, it is one of the main advantages of using a third-party password manager in the first place, since managers integrated with Apple, Google and Microsoft products will usually only work within their respective ecosystems.\nThe managers in this list, though, will work across at least some of them, since they will be compatible with Windows and Mac (and even Linux in some cases), as well as Android and iPhone.\nFor those who value the utmost privacy when online, you should look for a password manager that has a browser extension for specialist privacy browsers, like Brave. Again, we\u2019ve done our best to inform you which browsers and platforms each manager works with.\n4. Price: When it comes to price, bear in mind that while many will show monthly costs, they will often bill you annually, so keep in mind that you will have to part with a larger sum rather than spreading the cost throughout the year.\nMost managers on the market today will charge anywhere from $10 to $60 a year for individual plans, with family plans being somewhat more expensive. Business plans, on the other hand, can be more costly, and some even offer tailor-made enterprise plans that will require consultation before getting a quote.\nHow we tested the best password managers\nWe tested close to 30 of the most prominent password managers around, and picked out the very best to feature in this guide. During our testing, we made sure to try them out on every platform possible, to make sure they offered a consistent experience across all manner of devices and browsers.\nWe spent a considerable amount of time with each password manager to ensure that there were no nasty surprises that wouldn't necessarily crop up during a brief run through. We also tried to use them in every kind of situation we could think of, again in an effort to reveal any shortcomings that may have otherwise gone unnoticed.\nThe last thing you want to do is to change your password manager after discovering major flaws or aspects that you personally can\u2019t live with, so we do our best to be as thorough as possible and consider all the different types of users that will deploy password managers for their specific wants and needs.\nHowever, it is worth noting that good password managers usually offer easy ways to export your vault from one manager to another, so if you don\u2019t personally like a manager after spending a lot of time with it, don\u2019t feel you\u2019re stuck; most vendors offer easy-to-follow guides on switching to their manager from others - they want to win your custom, after all.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?
