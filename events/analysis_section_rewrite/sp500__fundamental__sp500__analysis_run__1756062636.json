      "feedback": "This draft would become world-class with a regime‑map, a single causal chain from policy to prices, and tightly quantified takeaways, all anchored in the provided sources; concretely, replace broad statements with a multi‑year regime framework (Regime A: universal tariffs with accelerated domestic capex in chips/AI; Regime B: tariff normalization/realignment with slower capex; Regime C: policy shocks or escalation) and state explicit transition conditions (e.g., tariff deadlines, chip‑capex announcements, energy‑cost trajectories) that would shift pricing; build a clean causal chain: tariff/reshoring push and allied supply‑chain realignment (SGB2PAZGK) lift domestic capex in semis/AI and power infrastructure (data centers) using baseload energy (Wyoming example) → tighter global supply chains and higher domestic ROIC/wacc differentials → re‑rating of capital‑intensive, high‑ROIC leaders vs. cyclical autos/retail; map Ford specifically to this regime: EV losses and modest revenue growth (Q2 4.3% margin, 10.1% ROIC per 65UUBU0OR; 17% YTD gain; 5.18% dividend; forward P/E ~10) versus tech/APM leaders, yielding a test of the regime’s pricing dynamics (22PL3Q360,65UUBU0OR); augment the Ford example with the CEO‑pay/readiness signal (median pay $19M, up 7.7% in 2024, per O4ZEED2EB) to illuminate how governance incentives align with capital allocation under the regime; resolve conflicts by choosing a transparent baseline tariff scenario drawn from SGB2PAZGK (and the Fox pieces) and present a sensitivity range (e.g., baseline 10% universal; China differential 34%–145% depending on stage) with explicit inflection points; quantify transmission: near‑term inflation risk from tariffs, expected capex acceleration in chips/energy, and longer‑run productivity via ROIC/WACC shifts; add a concise watchlist: tariff deadlines, chip/EV capex announcements, AI/data‑center deployments, ROIC trends, and energy costs; maintain tight formatting for a horizon of several years with base case, upside/downside regimes, key catalysts, invalidation triggers, and a clear confidence level, with citations after each factual assertion (SGB2PAZGK, 22PL3Q360, 65UUBU0OR, O4ZEED2EB); and keep the prose compact by synthesizing these into one coherent paragraph that ends with a concrete base case and the main risks to monitor.",
