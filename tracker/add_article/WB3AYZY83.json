      "summary": "Tron slashed its transaction fees by 60% on August 29, cutting energy unit prices from 210 to 100 sun to counter the erosion of its competitive edge caused by rising TRX prices. The reduction lowers USDT transfer costs from $1.64 to $4.28, but is expected to drive volume growth and add roughly 12 million users, offsetting the short‑term revenue hit. Despite the fee cut, Tron remains dominant with $24.6 billion in daily USDT volume and a 98.56 % share of the stablecoin ecosystem. The fee policy will be reviewed quarterly, linked to TRX price movements and network activity to balance profitability and market position.",
