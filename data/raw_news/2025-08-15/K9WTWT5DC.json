Actresses Regina Hall and Anna Faris confirmed their return to the Scary Movie franchise for the sixth film installment, according to an exclusive report from Deadline.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait to bring Brenda and Cindy back to life and be reunited with our great friends Keenen, Shawn and Marlon \u2014 three men we\u2019d literally die for (in Brenda\u2019s case, again),\u201d exclaimed the women in a joint statement.\n\nBrenda and Cindy were first introduced in 2000 in the first Scary Movie and are the only characters to appear in every release up until 2013\u2019s Scary Movie 5.\n\nLast year, Faris shared her enthusiasm to reunite with Hall on the silver screen before the film or casting was confirmed.\n\n\u201cI would love to work with Regina again. I just love her so much,\u201d she detailed. \u201cWe would make each other giggle all day long. Regina Hall would be my answer [regarding a reprise]. And money. But mostly all Regina!\u201d\n\nThat same year, Hall reflected a similar sentiment after the Wayans brothers confirmed the revival of the franchise.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just very excited to know that the Wayans, who actually started the project out of their idea, are back on board and at the helm again. I\u2019m excited for them. We\u2019ll see if Brenda is in this new world. I\u2019m thrilled at the possibility that the band could get back together again. That would be fun.\u201d\n\nBrenda and Cindy are not the only originals set to return for the sixth Scary Movie. Shawn Wayans, Keenan Ivory Wayans, and Marlon reunited with Miramax, the producers of the first two Scary Movie films.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to be a part of the new Scary Movie and work with each other again,\u201d the brothers shared in a statement. \u201cThis is a franchise we created more than 20 years ago. We remember people laughing in the aisles and hope to see that happen again. We look forward to working with Jonathan Glickman and his team at the new Miramax to bring these laughs to theaters, where they belong. It\u2019s a double reunion.\u201d\n\nScary Movie 6 is due in theaters on June 12, 2026.\n\u2022 None Regina Hall Says 'Girls Trip 2' Is \"Closest To Being In The Works\" Than It's Ever Been\n\u2022 None Regina Hall And Ice Spice Tapped For 'The SpongeBob Movie: Search For SquarePants' Cast\n\u2022 None Regina Hall Is \"Thrilled At The Possibility\" Of Returning For 'Scary Movie' Reboot\n\nSign up for Vibe's Newsletter.

Scary Movie is prepping for an October shoot in time for a June 12, 2026 global theatrical release via Paramount. Miramax has a first-look deal with Paramount.\nTiming is everything in comedy, and a new Scary Movie couldn\u2019t arrive at a better time in theaters when horror movies have hit saturation this year. The genre is screaming for a pie to be thrown in its face.\nWatch on Deadline\nThe near $900 million-grossing Scary Movie film franchise was developed by Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans and Keenen Ivory Wayans. The latter wrote and directed the first two films, and will return to produce the upcoming chapter. Marlon and Shawn wrote and starred in the first two films.\nThis will be the sixth film in the franchise, with Michael Tiddes set to direct. Tiddes is a longtime Wayans collaborator, starting as an assistant on White Chicks. He directed a trio of Wayans films \u2013 the satirical horror comedy A Haunted House and the Netflix hit movies Naked and Sextuplets. Tiddes is repped by Artists First and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher.\nMiramax\u2019s Jonathan Glickman, Alexandra Loewy and Thomas Zadra are executive producing.\nThe Scary Movie comedies span fives movies, the first being in released in 2000 when it was one of the highest-grossing R-rated horror movies of all time back in the day. The original also set the box office opening record for an R-rated horror movie at $42.5 million.\nThe Independent Artist Group-repped Hall next stars in Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s Warner Bros movie One Battle After Another with Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro, hitting theaters on September 26. She\u2019s also starring in Nick Stoller\u2019s Judgment Day with Will Ferrell and Zac Efron. She is currently in production on The Five Star Weekend for Peacock, opposite Jennifer Garner, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Gemma Chan and Timothy Olyphant. Additionally, she\u2019ll lead her voice to the upcoming The SpongeBob Movie: Search for Squarepants alongside Sherry Cola, Arturo Castro, George Lopez and Ice Spice.\nFaris is repped by Gersh, Range Media Partners and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern. Following her breakout in the Scary Movie series, she went on to star in and produce The House Bunny and Greg Araki\u2019s Smiley Face. She will next star in Spa Weekend. Other feature credits include The Dictator with Sasha Baron Cohen, Overboard, Just Friends and Oscar-winning titles Brokeback Mountain and Lost in Translation. Faris starred for eight seasons in the hit CBS sitcom Mom opposite Allison Janney and had memorable arcs on Friends and Entourage. She also penned the New York Times bestselling memoir Unqualified.\nMarlon Wayans teased Hall and Faris\u2019 casting on IG:\nI\u2019m 19 and have zero interest in this reboot. I love horror not comedy. The world today is too dangerous to waste time with comedy\nBros a bot for sure.\nNice! Cannot wait. They could also bring back Pam Anderson as Becca. She survived Scary Movie 3 after all.\nYes!!!!\nWe won.\nThat\u2019s amazing! These two have great chemistry together. Also would love to see Wayans brothers making fun of multiverse thing with Simon Rex coming back as both his characters. The one from SM3 & 4 and the one from SM5."
