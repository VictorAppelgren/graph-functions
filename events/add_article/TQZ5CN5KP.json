      "summary": "Apple is set to unveil the iPhone 17 lineup on September 9, with rumors of an A19 chip, Dynamic Island, a 6.1‑inch OLED display, a 48‑MP rear camera, and a slimmer iPhone 17 Air featuring a titanium frame and a 2,800‑mAh battery. Analysts expect a $50 price increase across the range, potentially offset by higher storage options, while iOS 26 will ship with a new Liquid Glass UI and AI‑driven features. The event also coincides with speculation that Apple will continue to navigate tariff pressures by expanding U.S. manufacturing and may introduce additional hardware such as AirPods Pro 3 and a new Apple TV.",
