  "title": "\u2018A paradigm change\u2019: black hole spotted that may have been created moments after big bang",
  "description": "Sighting by James Webb space telescope of black hole with sparse halo of material could upend theories of the universe",
  "content": "An ancient and \u201cnearly naked\u201d black hole that astronomers believe may have been created in the first fraction of a second after the big bang has been spotted by the James Webb space telescope.\n\nIf confirmed as a so-called primordial black hole, a theoretical class of object predicted to exist by Stephen Hawking but never before seen, the discovery would upend prevailing theories of the universe.\n\nUntil now, the mainstream view has been that stars and galaxies appeared first and that black holes were created only when the earliest stars ran out of fuel and collapsed under their own gravity.\n\nBut the latest observations by the space telescope, which reveal a gargantuan black hole with only a sparse halo of surrounding material dating back to the dawn of the cosmos, appear incompatible with this sequence of events.\n\n\u201cThis black hole is nearly naked,\u201d said Prof Roberto Maiolino, a cosmologist at the University of Cambridge who is one of the team behind the observations. \u201cThis is really challenging for the theories. It seems that this black hole has formed without being preceded by a galaxy around it.\u201d\n\nPrimordial black holes are hypothesised to have been formed in the first fraction of a second after the big bang by denser and hotter regions collapsing in on themselves. In this scenario, black holes of varying sizes were stitched into the fabric of the cosmos from almost the beginning and acted as gravitational pockets around which the dust and gas that formed the first galaxies began to cluster. Hawking pioneered the theory in the 1970s, but with no observational proof in the decades since they have come to be viewed as speculative or \u201cexotic\u201d.\n\nThe latest observations focus on a \u201clittle red dot\u201d known as QSO1 dating back more than 13bn years to when the universe was just 700m years old. It is one of a scattering of such dots found by the JWST that are so red, so compact and so bright that astronomers have concluded they must be ancient supermassive black holes.\n\nGiven that black holes are typically assumed to start small and snowball over time by gobbling up stars, scientists have been puzzled about how these black holes got so big so early in the universe\u2019s history.\n\nDespite QSO1\u2019s extreme distance, astronomers were able to track the orbital speed of the swirling halo of gas and dust. This measurement gave the mass of the central black hole as 50m solar masses, with the total mass of the surrounding material being less than half of this value, according to the findings posted on the preprint Arxiv website.\n\n\u201cThis is in stark contrast with what we observe in our local universe, where the black holes at the centre of galaxies [like the Milky Way] are about a thousand times less massive than their host galaxy,\u201d said Maiolino.\n\nIn a separate analysis, the glowing material around the black hole was found to be chemically \u201cpristine\u201d, comprising almost exclusively of hydrogen and helium, the two elements left over after the big bang. The absence of heavier elements, which are forged in stars, adds to evidence that there is no significant star formation in the black hole\u2019s vicinity.\n\n\u201cThese results are a paradigm change,\u201d said Maiolino. \u201cHere we\u2019re witnessing a massive black hole formed without much of a galaxy, as far as we can say from the data.\u201d\n\nAnother way this could have occurred is through a vast cloud of gas and dust in the early universe collapsing directly into a black hole rather than fragmenting and forming stars. But \u201cdirect collapse\u201d is predicted to require very specific environmental conditions that are not evident in the observations, leading the scientists to have a slight preference for the primordial black hole scenario.\n\nProf Andrew Pontzen, a cosmologist at University of Durham who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cA confirmed primordial origin for black holes would have profound implications for fundamental laws of physics.\n\n\u201cThe researchers behind this study use new JWST observations to strengthen the case for primordial origins, but it\u2019s an indirect argument and it will take time for the debate to be settled. A decade from now the next generation of gravitational wave detectors, perfect for sniffing out black holes across the entire universe, will settle the matter.\u201d",

These findings have prompted the development of several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes, which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift 7.04, hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the [OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow Hbeta emission indicates an extremely low chemical enrichment, less than 0.01 solar. We argue that such properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations, although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in rare cases. Models invoking \"primordial black holes\" (i.e. putative black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment associated with this black hole.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Roberto Maiolino [view email][v1] Wed, 28 May 2025 16:43:24 UTC (1,296 KB)\n[v2] Thu, 29 May 2025 11:08:39 UTC (1,296 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\nastro-ph.GA\nChange to browse by:\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

      "text": "Astrophysics > Astrophysics of Galaxies\n[Submitted on 29 Aug 2025]\nTitle:A direct black hole mass measurement in a Little Red Dot at the Epoch of Reionization\nView PDFAbstract:Recent discoveries of faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the redshift frontier have revealed a plethora of broad \\Halpha emitters with optically red continua, named Little Red Dots (LRDs), which comprise 15-30\\% of the high redshift broad line AGN population. Due to their peculiar spectral properties and X-ray weakness, modeling LRDs with standard AGN templates has proven challenging. In particular, the validity of single-epoch virial mass estimates in determining the black hole (BH) masses of LRDs has been called into question, with some models claiming that masses might be overestimated by up to 2 orders of magnitude, and other models claiming that LRDs may be entirely stellar in nature. We report the direct, dynamical BH mass measurement in a strongly lensed LRD at $z = 7.04$. The combination of lensing with deep spectroscopic data reveals a rotation curve that is inconsistent with a nuclear star cluster, yet can be well explained by Keplerian rotation around a point mass of 50 million Solar masses, consistent with virial BH mass estimates from the Balmer lines. The Keplerian rotation leaves little room for any stellar component in a host galaxy, as we conservatively infer $M_{\\rm BH}/M_{*}>2$. Such a ''naked'' black hole, together with its near-pristine environment, indicates that this LRD is a massive black hole seed caught in its earliest accretion phase.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Ignas Juod\u017ebalis [view email][v1] Fri, 29 Aug 2025 16:20:50 UTC (1,262 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\nastro-ph.GA\nChange to browse by:\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

      "text": "Why Is Hydrogen the Most Common Element in the Universe?\nThis story was updated April 4 at 12:24 p.m. EDT.\nHydrogen is the most common element in the universe, but why is that?\nTo answer this question, \"we need to go back to the Big Bang,\" said May Nyman, a professor of chemistry at Oregon State University.\nThe Big Bang created the elements on the periodic table, building blocks that help make up the universe. Each element has a unique number of subatomic particles: protons (positively charged), neutrons (neutral) and electrons (negatively charged). [What Are the Ingredients of Life?]\nHydrogen \u2014 with just one proton and one electron (it's the only element without a neutron) \u2014 is the simplest element in the universe, which explains why it's also the most abundant, Nyman said. (However, an isotope of hydrogen, called deuterium, contains one protron and one neutron, and another, known as tritium, has one proton and two neutrons.)\nIn stars, hydrogen atoms fuse to create helium \u2014 the second most common element in the universe, according to Encyclopedia.com. Helium has two protons, two neutrons and two electrons. Together, helium and hydrogen make up 99.9 percent of known matter in the universe, according to Encyclopedia.com.\nEven so, there is still about 10 times more hydrogen than helium in the universe, Nyman said. Oxygen, the third most common element, is about 1,000 times less abundant than hydrogen, she added.\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!\nIn general, the higher the atomic number, the less abundant is the element is, Nyman said.\nEarth's composition, however, is different from that of the entire universe. For instance, oxygen is the most common element by weight in Earth's crust, followed by silicon, aluminum and iron, according to HyperPhysics, a site run by Georgia State University.\nIn the human body, the most common element by weight is oxygen, followed by carbon and hydrogen, according to HyperPhysics.\nHydrogen has a number of key roles in the human body. Hydrogen bonds help give DNA its signature twist, and it helps the stomach and other organs maintain the correct pH, or how acidic or basic it is, Nyman said.\n\"If your stomach gets too basic, hydrogen will be released to what it's bonded to,\" she said. \"If it's too acidic, [hydrogen] will bond to something.\"\nIn addition, hydrogen allows ice to float on water (H20) because the hydrogen bonds push the frozen water molecules apart, making them less dense.\n\"Usually, substances are more dense when they're solid than when they're liquid,\" Nyman said. \"Water is the only substance that is less dense than when it's [a] solid.\"\nHowever, hydrogen can also be dangerous. Hydrogen gas reacting with oxygen led to the Hindenburg blimp catastrophe that killed 36 people in 1937, according to Airships.net. Moreover, hydrogen bombs can be incredibly destructive, although they have never been used as a weapon, \"just demonstrated by the United States, USSR, Great Britain, France and China in the 1950s,\" Nyman said.\nHydrogen bombs, like atomic bombs, use a combination of nuclear fusion and fission reactions to cause destruction, and release both radiation and mechanical shock waves when detonated, she said.\nEditor's Note: This article has been updated to include information about hydrogen isotopes and to say that H-bombs can release radiation.\nOriginal article on Live Science.\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!
