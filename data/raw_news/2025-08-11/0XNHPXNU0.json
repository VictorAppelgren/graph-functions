  "title": "JPMorgan's Hui on China's Anti-Involution Drive",
  "description": "JPMorgan's Asset Management APAC Chief Market Strategist Tai Hui describes China's attempts to reduce excessive competition as \"adventurous\" and suggests the impact needs to be assessed sector by sector. Hui speaks as China\u2019s electric vehicle makers and food delivery giants are locked in a fierce price war, prompting government concern over deflationary pressures and long-term sustainability. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "You guys mentioned the anti-evolution drive just now. How to reduce excess competition. I do think we have to be quite careful with this theme because if you think of the whole supply chain where they spat fees or eaves or any other products, the demand is the ultimate driver of profitability. If the demands are the end, consumers are not spending more. You're basically just reshuffling earnings along supply chain. So you might benefit one part of supply chain, but the other pocket squeezed. So again, I think it's not going to benefit everyone. It's going to be more a sector by sector or different segment of supply chain drive to choose from. Okay. And is it a good to chase some parts of those sectors, though, now and this rally that seems to be you're seeing it, right? It's it's a solar. You know, it's it's basically commodities one day and then it's food delivery. Do you chase it? I think it's going to be quite challenging, especially with policies coming out, you know, every other day. But at the same time, I think you have to ask the question if, for example, even your battery technology, what is the role of pricing and volume and technology? For example, in battery technology, the market leaders are there not because they produce the most, but because they've got they've got the best technology that can carry the industry forward in EV. Obviously, you've got the giant iconic names, but you know who this? And then the question then becomes who will benefit if the level of competition does come down, I suspect is going to be the one level down, not the small companies that are struggling right now. Those who are struggling today could still face elimination one, two, three years down the line. So I think it's going to be a case by case sector, by sector selection when it comes to looking for opportunities, when seeking to reduce excessive competition. And the reality is anywhere in the world, much of the policy have been tried to promote competition. There's been a lot of research or academic work done on how to regulate or reduce competition. So I think these are a right call, but is also quite an adventurous call in managing this type of competition.",

  "summary": "The article discusses the significance of China's anti-evolution drive, which aims to reduce excess competition and address the issue of demand in the supply chain. However, it suggests that it may not benefit all sectors of the industry, with some arguing that demand is the ultimate driver of profitability, rather than profits. The author suggests that while some sectors may benefit from this strategy, others may face elimination due to the lack of competition. The article also mentions the challenge of chasing sectors such as solar, food delivery, and pharmaceuticals.",
