  "title": "I tested Synology's BeeStation Plus - and this subscription-free NAS could replace your cloud storage",
  "description": "Synology is known for its Network Attached Storage solutions, now they have the perfect simple solution for small businesses, even those without a super technical need, all without a subscription.",
  "content": "The BeeStation Plus is an easy to use cloud storage solution that has zero subscription cost, gives you control of your 8TB of storage, allows for advanced integrations and control over where your data is and how it is accessed, and while it is not as configurable as a full-fledged DiskStation, it is the perfect balance between power users and ease of use.\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test.\n\nI've used Synology for a while now, both personally and professionally. I've worked with DiskStations, the original BeeStation, and many other NAS devices, too. As someone who juggles many businesses, clients, and a ton of storage at any given time, even with great internal storage on my primary laptop, access to more on others that I am testing, and external drives all around me, there is something simple and so helpful about cloud storage.\n\nBut, as many of you have also noticed, subscriptions are getting ridiculous these days. Everything has moved to subscriptions, and with that, when you want to expand further, the cost continues to skyrocket. That's why I started paying attention to Synology a few years back, recognizing that while some things I can keep on SSDs, having everything accessible no matter what company I am with, if I am home or away, or no matter what device, was something that I still desired in my daily workflow.\n\nThe ease and ability to pull up any number of documents, photos, videos, diagrams, and so on for any of my clients at any time, all without cluttering my internal storage or having to rummage through several external hard drives, is hard to pass up.\n\nThe frictionless action of searching in Finder (on my Mac) to grab the file I want and have it ready on my machine without having to store it there is always spectacular. And, with how fast I move these days, that is the kind of flexibility I need. That's where the BeeStation Plus comes in. It's got a few key upgrades from the original BeeStation, the first and foremost being that it doubled in storage from 4TB to 8TB.\n\nThe Synology BeeStation Plus is available the official website by clicking here. Right now, it's being sold for around $400 for the 8TB of NAS.Right now, it's being sold for around $400 for the 8TB of NAS.\n\nIt's also available from other online retailers including B&H Photo, Amazon.com, and Amazon.co.uk.\n\nUnboxing and setting up the BeeStation Plus could not have been easier. I opened up the box, chose a spot in my home office where I wanted it to live, and plugged it into my monster of a desk setup with battery backup from my Anker Power Station with UPS. Lastly, to ensure I had the best download and upload speeds possible, I plugged the included Ethernet cable in from the Synology BeeStation Plus to my network switch, which then routes up to my TP-Link Deco XE75 Pro system. One power cable, one Ethernet cable, that's all.\n\nAfter that, I jumped in and set up the BeeStation Plus via the IP address and web interface and began setting up sync folders, shared folders, a Plex Server, backups to my DiskStation (review coming soon), and more. I also added one right-angle USB-C adapter, but more on that later. All around, this setup took a matter of minutes, and probably took longer for me to cable manage one more thing into my monster of a desk setup than it did actually to set up the BeeStation Plus itself.\n\nThe BeeStation Plus has a sleek matte plastic shell with its modern and clean design. It blends in, and it fits in with my office setup. I don't feel like I need to hide it, so I didn't. It's got a visible spot in my setup, but I barely notice it, which is excellent.\n\nEven when this NAS is up and running, I can't hear it at all. The only reason that I know it is on, other than being able to access my files, is because of the status lights.\n\nThe only ports on here are the Ethernet port, a USB-C port, and the power port. The BeeStation Plus keeps it simple while packing a lot of power in a simple package.\n\nSynology BeeStation Plus: In use\n\nI've had the BeeStation Plus set up in my home office for 75 days at the time of writing this review. In that time, the BeeStation Plus has been my primary storage solution for the many clients that I work with, for all of the files, content, and assets that I have created for each client, as well as working files I have received from clients. All of them are stored on the BeeStation Plus and accessed from my many devices via the files/finder integrations or from the web or mobile apps.\n\nThanks to the Ethernet port, I have not noticed any downtime or issues with network speeds, and because my entire workspace is backed up with a power station from Anker, I don't worry about losing any data either. Even in a power outage, I could access my files locally from my computer over local Wi-Fi or Ethernet. Alternatively, if my internet line is still active but power is out, my whole home battery backup system will kick in, and I can access files from anywhere.\n\nIf you don't have a battery backup, though, that is not the end of the world; you will want to have a plan in place in case of a power outage if you have critical client files stored on the BeeStation Plus.\n\nAnother critical way that I utilize the BeeStation Plus is to offload files from any drives I am working with. Occasionally, I have a role where I need to transfer data from external drives or SD Cards. With the BeeStation Plus' USB-C port, I can plug in an SSD directly to that port, or I can use an SD Card reader with a USB-C port and plug that in to access an SD Card directly through my BeeStation Plus.\n\nThe benefit to this, of course, is that I never have to take up internal storage, nor do I have to ingest files, to upload them to a cloud service, to then share. Instead, I can plug in, choose where to move the files to, such as a previously shared client folder, and then I am good to go. I can walk away, work on something else, and so on.\n\nAnother thing that makes the BeeStation Plus super helpful, mainly when used as a business storage tool, is the ability to sync in multiple different ways, with multiple different servers. I work across Google Drive, Dropbox, and others daily.\n\nFor those folders that I want to make sure I don't lose anything, or that I have what I need, without having to jump in and out of folders every day, logging in and out of accounts and trying to remember where I have each file. Instead, I set up cloud sync preferences so that my folder structure on my BeeStation Plus will automatically stay in sync with some folders, one way download other folders, and auto upload to others\u2014making my file management a breeze. Setting something like this up right from the start makes it feel like I have an admin helping me manage my file management, without the need for an admin or a monthly subscription cost.\n\nAll in all, the Synology BeeStation Plus is a welcome upgrade from the previous model. I haven't even gone into depth on the Plex integrations and other TLC updates that Synology has made. This is the perfect storage solution if you need terabytes of secure storage and don't want to pay an absurd monthly charge to access your files on another big-name cloud storage service. Power users may still need something more robust like the DiskStation, but for small businesses, freelancers, contract workers, and fractional guys like me, this is a spectacular option.\n\nFor more storage solutions, we've reviewed the best NAS hard drives you can get right now.",

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe TP-Link Deco XE75 Pro is a top Wi-Fi 6E mesh system that offers high-speed, low-latency performance for large homes. With multi-gig support, AI-driven optimization, and seamless roaming, it provides a reliable network for virtual meetings, streaming, and smart devices. While it lacks USB ports and has subscription-based security features, its performance and easy setup make it one of the best options on the market.\nPros\n- +\nFast tri-band Wi-Fi 6E speeds\n- +\n2.5GbE WAN port\n- +\nSeamless roaming with AI-driven mesh\n- +\nCovers up to 7,200 sq. ft.\n- +\nConnects up to 200 devices\n- +\nEthernet ports on the extra points for wired connectivity over Mesh\nCons\n- -\nNo USB ports for external storage or printers\n- -\nHomeShield Pro features require a subscription\n- -\nLacks some advanced customization settings for power users\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe TP-Link Deco XE75 Pro is an impressive mesh Wi-Fi system that works in large spaces, can easily connect up to 200 devices, and has some pretty impressive features. As Wi-Fe 6E adoption continues to grow, and some manufacturers are even up to a Wi-Fi 7, mesh systems like the TP-Link Deco XE75 Pro offer incredible wireless speeds and stability for users in a very accessible fashion. This system is easy to set up, can stretch to 7,200 sq. feet of coverage without a problem, and boasts a 2.5GbE port.\nI've been running this system at my home/home studio/home office for the last few months to get comfortable with how well it operates. I've had a few hiccups, but this Wi-Fi system has been a massive upgrade from my previous Google Nest Wi-Fi mesh Wi-Fi routers (one of the best Wi-Fi mesh systems for everyday use) and has brought some enhancements I now cannot live without.\nLike many people post-COVID, I work from home quite a bit. And, when I am not working from home, I still have things like my client server through Synology's BeeStation, my Plex Server, and other processes running on a Mac Mini Server I have in my home office that I need to access. All this and more can run easily in my 1990s house without ethernet cables running through my walls -- but more on this later.\nTP-Link Deco XE75 Pro: Price and Availability\nThe TP-Link Deco XE75 Pro comes in a couple of options: a two-pack and a three-pack offering. The two-pack is rated at 5,500 sq. ft. and usually sells for around $400. My three-pack variant covers up to 7,200 sq. ft. and usually retails for around $600. You can pick this up at Amazon, Best Buy, or through TP-Link's official website by clicking here.\nTP-Link Deco XE75 Pro: Unboxing and First Impressions\nI'm a fan of minimalist tech. I like things to be simple and sleek. I also like things to work well. When I first opened the Deco XE75 Pro box, I was happy to see that the router was a sleep and sharp white dome that did not look bad. I've never been a fan of the black spider-looking routers that were so popular for so long, which is partially why I had stuck with a Google Nest Mesh Wi-Fi system for so long up until now. The units are compact and well-designed, with a beautifully designed point and an easy line of ports on the back, running up the height of the cylindrical design. The nodes, if you will, are all identical, meaning it's super easy to grab one and have it be the central unit -- something I later realized I could also change in the app if I needed to.\nIn the box comes the nodes, power adapters, and an ethernet cable to connect whichever node you want to be the primary node to your modem. The setup was super easy. I downloaded the companion app and followed the instructions. I had everything operational in a matter of 10 minutes at most.\nTP-Link Deco XE75 Pro: Design and Build Quality\nWi-Fi Speeds:\n6 GHz: 2402 Mbps\n5 GHz: 2402 Mbps\n2.4 GHz: 574 Mbps\nDimensions (W\u00d7D\u00d7H):\n4.1 \u00d7 4.1 \u00d7 6.7 in (105 \u00d7 105 \u00d7 169 mm)\nIncluded:\n3 Deco XE75 Pro units\n1 RJ45 Ethernet cable\n3 Power adapters\n1 Quick Installation Guide\nThe design of the XE75 Pro is simple and aesthetically pleasing. Normally, I hide away my routers, but in two instances in my house, I have left them out in the open. One was on purpose, and the other was because I didn't need to hide it. These nodes stand about 6.7 inches tall and 4.1 inches wide and are cylindrical. They have a matte white finish with a black top, and the ports are all located on one side, running up the node's height. There is a 2.5Gbe WAN port, 2x 1GbE LAN ports, a power jack, and a reset button. One thing to note that's missing is any USB ports; however, this was not a huge loss for my use case. I've had them in the past, and they are helpful, but with my Synology BeeStation and Mac mini server, I didn't miss it in this rendition of my home office setup.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nTP-Link Deco XE75 Pro: In use\nI could get into a spec sheet and talk for a few hundred words about the performance of this router, but that wouldn't be as exciting as talking about my real-life use case. I set this router up several months ago, and it works well. I could connect with all my devices in my home and office as I needed to. The Wi-Fi was solid, I could reach my correct speeds, and the stability was pretty good. Nothing incredible and nothing terrible. That was until I dug into what this router could do, and everything changed for me.\nOne day, when I was contemplating running CAT 6 through the walls of my 1990s house so I could get both a more stable internet connection for my work and a wired connection to test some PCs that were in the queue that didn't have Wi-Fi antennas built in (shocking, I know), I remembered the ethernet ports on the back of the router that was sitting on my desk looking like a modern art piece. After some basic research, I learned that this could serve not just as ports on the central unit but could be something I plug a device into on the points connected over Mesh and connect as though I was wired to my modem.\nWhen I figured this out, I took things a step further and bought a small network switch that I mounted under my desk (photo below). Now, I had multiple ports that I could connect to and get a stable internet connection, even without having a Wi-Fi antenna or relying on Wi-Fi. This was perfect for my BeeStation, my old Mac Mini Server (that I'm shocked is still kicking it, even without a reliable Wi-Fi antenna), and some smart home access points (Phillips Hue, Flic, etc). Next up, I wanted to make my connection as perfect as possible. At this time, my central unit was behind a Christmas tree and started having some issues. So, I looked it up; sure enough, Christmas trees can cause interference. So, I moved my main router to a different part of my living room and voila, I had a near-perfect connection to my other two access points running full Wi-Fi channels for 6GHz, 5GHz, and 2.4GHz connecting to nearly 80 devices at any given time (yes, my house has a lot of smart technology). The Deco app also has a built-in optimizer to help with this; with one click, I could change the channels to cause less interference, strengthening my network even more.\nHaving those ethernet ports on the back of my points and being able to act as an extension from the central unit has been something I didn't know I needed, but now, legitimately, I cannot live without it. It has allowed me to connect even dated or limited devices to blazing-fast internet without having to poke holes in my walls and traverse between floorboards to bring a CAT6 Ethernet cable from my main floor down across the footprint of my home to my basement home office/studio. Further, it has helped me speed up my testing process, allowing me to run updates and download testing software without having to take another step to connect to my Wi-Fi manually. I can plug into a \" wired \" dock to my modem, and I'm automatically connected to the internet.\nAnother massive win for the Deco XE75 Pro Wi-Fi system is that I can have my own built-in VPN to connect back to my home network without paying some absurd fee or having some crazy tech added to my network. I could set this up with limited knowledge of VPN creation and only a few minutes. Now, anywhere in the world, I can connect to my home network and access printers, local cameras, local storage, computers on my home network, and so on.\nLastly, if I did want to pay, I could get a host of AI-enhanced features that TP-Link has that could give me even more ability through this incredible router.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Beautiful Design | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nMaterial quality | Great Materials | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Easy to use -- Follow Instructions | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPracticality | Practical for Most | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPrice | Pricy, but quality | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nTP-Link Deco XE75 Pro: Final verdict\nThe TP-Link Deco XE75 Pro is an excellent Wi-Fi 6E mesh system for those seeking high-speed, low-latency performance with wide coverage. The AI-driven mesh technology and seamless roaming make it ideal for large spaces with multiple devices, and the extra ethernet ports allow the ability to turn a wireless network into a place to plug in wired devices. While it lacks USB ports and some security features require a paid subscription, its performance, ease of use, and future-proofed design make it one of the best Wi-Fi 6E mesh options available.\nFor more for home networking, we reviewed the best Wi-Fi routers around.\nFormer TechRadar Pro B2B Hardware Editor, Collin has been in journalism for years, with experience in small and large markets, including Gearadical, DailyBeast, FutureNet, and more.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Anker Solix F3800 Smart Home Power Kit is a powerful and versatile home energy solution with industry-leading features, but the high initial cost may deter budget-conscious buyers.\nPros\n- +\nScalable up to 53.8kWh for prolonged outages.\n- +\nSeamless integration with grid and solar systems.\n- +\nApp-based intelligent energy monitoring and control.\n- +\nQuick solar recharge with 2,400W input (80% in 1.5 hours).\n- +\nReliable 5-year warranty and 10-year component lifespan.\nCons\n- -\nHigh upfront cost despite ongoing discounts.\n- -\nRequires additional accessories for full solar functionality.\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nJust over a year ago, I reviewed the Anker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station, which is great; the only issue was that it was huge and heavy. So, while technically portable, it was not pleasant to move around. Since then, I have doubled my usage of the F3800, got another one, and had an electrician install the Smart Home Power Panel from Anker, plus a sub-panel that Anker offers to create a fully backed-up home/studio.\nThe F3800 is now offered in a package with just that, two F3800s with a smart home panel, and you can add on the sub panel depending on your use case. This package is designed to meet the rising demand and plea for electrical backup and sustainable power in this digital world.\nNot only is this a residential power backup solution, but it also acts as the inverter and does all the heavy lifting if I want to add solar panels and cut back on my grid usage. All around, the F3800 was impressive, and one of the best portable power stations I've reviewed. Where it lacked is mitigated when you add another and the home power panel and shove this in your storage area behind your office, granting peace of mind for your home in case of severe weather or power outage, plus the opportunity to throw solar panels on your roof to collect some extra power from none other than the sun.\nAnker Solix F3800 Home Power System: Price and Availability\nThis package from Anker is typically priced just north of $9,000. However, they are currently discounted to $5,599 with the code WSTDQR0929. There are options for installment payments through several different providers through Anker's website if needed, which is lovely as these are offered exclusively via Anker's website and have limited-time promotions.\nAnker Solix F3800 Home Power System: Unboxing & first impressions\nSince I already had one F3800, I was familiar with what it would be like to receive another. Nothing was different; the only new part was getting the power panel and the sub-panel. The Smart Power Panel was smaller than I expected, but I'm not upset because it fits better than I thought on the wall I picked.\nRight now, I only have two F3800s. However, in the future, I will probably expand my battery capacity by adding a BP3800, which is just a battery unit that one of the F3800s could utilize. I could add up to 12 (6 per F3800) BP3800 batteries, each at 3840Wh capacity, totaling a whopping 53.8kWh battery capacity stored for my home.\nAnother thing I will add is solar panels. This time around, I did not grab any. However, I will probably add these in the future, especially since all I need are the panels and the cable to get down to my basement since I already have the inverter and batteries installed.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nThe setup process was straightforward; I called an electrician. In all seriousness, though, the electrician also had a pretty straightforward setup. He located my breaker in my basement, tailed off of that to connect to the Smart Home panel, and then integrated a sub-panel as well, so if I do have to power my home via these batteries, I can designate where that power is even able to go, prioritizing the essentials, and not having to worry about if there is something in my home that was left on that is not essential that would be a waste of battery.\nAfter installing these, I could plug the cables from the power panel down to the F3800s, tuck them away, and then set them up through the app. I added my home, connected the unit to Wi-Fi, and then it registered that the F3800s were connected. From that point, I could see what I was pulling off the grid and set how much capacity I wanted the batteries to fill to (I chose a standard of 90%, with the ability to trigger \"storm guard\" that will quickly fill the batteries to 100% when I get an alert that there is a storm coming and then go back to my standard after that storm has passed) and the ability to set up other safety and battery preservation settings.\nAnker Solix F3800 Home Power System: Design & build quality\nOutput: 12kW (dual system) with 120V/240V split-phase support.\nCapacity: 7.68kWh per unit, expandable to 53.8kWh with additional batteries.\nSolar Input: Up to 2,400W, compatible with MC4-based solar panels.\nBattery: LFP with an expected lifespan of 10+ years.\nCharging: AC (1,800W) and solar (80% in 1.5 hours).\nThe overall design of this setup is quite sleek. I've seen some significant and cumbersome setups, and they always need to be placed outside because they have exhaust systems from gas generators.\nThe reasonably sized power panel can be mounted to the wall with two simple brackets. Lastly, the sub-panel can be mounted on identical cross beams to the power panel, making installation easy.\nAnker Solix F3800 Home Power System: In use\nSo far, having my entire home backed up with battery power has been fantastic. It's freeing to know that, with my three kids and my wife, we can ensure that our house and what we need for the children are okay in a power outage. Any sound machines, heaters, fans, night lights, monitors for their rooms, security alarms, and so forth are all backed up in an emergency, storm that knocks out power, or grid outages.\nPreviously, in the \"prepare for the worst\" mindset that I have and my unique situation where I have a multitude of power stations on hand at any given time, I would have power stations set up around the house at key areas ready for a power outage as a UPS, or I knew that if I ever needed to, I could run down to my office and drag one of the big ones up to plug in the fridge, a heater, or whatever else I needed in the moment. Now, however, I don't have to do any of that. Granted, I still have the Solix C1000 running my main desk in my office, but that's simply because I chose not to include the finished part of the basement in my sub-panel so I could focus the battery on more important things that I don't already have a solution for such as the heat, stage one of my AC, fridges, kids rooms, primary bedroom, and the microwave. I also chose to have my living room backed up, knowing that my central unit for my mesh router system (review coming soon) and the modem is there.\nBecause of the draw of my stage one AC unit for my house, I opted for two F3800s to get the 12kW, as opposed to the 6kW that I could get with just one F3800.\nAnother great feature is that I can output at 120V or 240V, depending on the demand of the equipment. This means that if I wanted to, I could run my electric dryer, charge my not-so-real-but-maybe-in-the-future Tesla, or even run another stage on my HVAC.\nAll of this \"preparing for the worst\" is great, but what might be the coolest part of this setup is something that I haven't even mentioned yet. It's the fact that I could throw some solar panels on my roof or even in my yard if I wanted to, and I could harvest the sun to not only refill my batteries but help run my house in a power outage or even offset my grid usage. I could set this up to where, in peak hours (if I lived in an area with peak hours for electrical), I could pull from solar and battery power and then recharge in the lower hours, utilizing solar when I can and then pulling from the grid last, saving money on electricity. All of this could be set automatically, meaning that without even thinking about it or changing anything I am doing, I could save real money on electricity with this Anker SOLIX Smart Home Power Kit.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Simple and minimal design | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Easy for an electrician to install | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPracticality | Highly practical for professionals | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPrice | Well priced | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAnker Solix F3800 Home Power System: Final verdict\nThe Anker Solix F3800 Smart Home Power Kit offers a near-perfect blend of performance, scalability, and sustainability. While its steep upfront cost may give potential buyers pause, its ability to be both a backup solution and a solar powerhouse, saving you money on electricity every day, makes this an incredible two-birds-one-stone solution.\nFormer TechRadar Pro B2B Hardware Editor, Collin has been in journalism for years, with experience in small and large markets, including Gearadical, DailyBeast, FutureNet, and more.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

Now, we're rounding up the best NAS drives - with an emphasis on speed, capacity, and value for money.\nFor that reason, the Seagate Ironwolf Pro is my top pick overall, with a hard drive that offers good speeds, plenty of storage capacity, and a price-point that makes it more accessible than most on the market right now. You can check out the review below, alongside alternative picks for your budget and use-case.\nNeed more storage? We've also tested the largest SSD and hard drive available.\nThe best NAS hard drive: quick list\nBest overall\nThe best NAS drive overall\nThis high-capacity HDD is perfect for NAS servers thanks to its accessible price and endurance for the long haul, though it has a lower yearly workload limit than some enterprise options.\nBest budget\nThe best budget NAS hard drive\nWhile the performance on this drive might not match the best NAS drives out there, this drive is all about maximizing storage capacity at a low price, and here it succeeds brilliantly.\nBest enterprise\nThe best NAS hard drive for enterprise\nEnterprise clients need more than most hard drive users, including high capacities and speeds, and the Seagate EXOS had drive is as fast as a hard drive can get while offering up to 20TB.\nThe best NAS hard drive overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAmazingly, cramming ten 2TB platters and 20 heads into a 3.5-inch drive package is possible. But Seagate achieved this using CMR technology and replacing the atmosphere inside the drive with Helium.\nOn the plus side of this equation, the new IronWolf Pro 20TB is 2TB bigger than the 18TB model, about 25MB/s faster at reading and writing, and it's more power-efficient. All these advantages come at a price that is only marginally more than the 18TB option. So it's a no-brainer for commercial and enterprise NAS to support the needs of creative professionals and large businesses, indeed?\nThe blot on this landscape is the yearly workload limit of 300TB, which could quickly be eaten by regular integrity testing, not to mention actual use. With data center drives offering 550TB workload limits at a very similar price and nearly identical performance, the IronWolf Pro might not be the best drive for the job, depending on your NAS profile.\nRead our full Seagate IronWolf Pro 20TB review\nThe best budget NAS hard drive\n2. Western Digital Red\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIt was only a few years ago that Western Digital\u2019s 6TB NAS was the pack leader, offering more storage space than you could get from competing models. While that\u2019s no longer the case, it\u2019s still a unit with capacious storage space. Designed for businesses and consumers, it offers fast performance, especially in multi-drive environments with strong large-block sequential read and write speeds.\nFind the best deals on Western Digital products with our Western Digital promo codes.\nThe best NAS hard drive for enterprise\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAnother Seagate drive with ten 2TB platters in the classic 3.5-inch form factor to sit alongside the new IronWolf Pro 20TB. The only significant difference on the outside is that the EXOS comes in a SAS flavor in addition to a conventional SATA variety model.\nThe EXOS drive beats the IronWolf Pro with a workload limit of 550TB, a significant improvement over the 300TB of its brother mechanism. These are the same workload limits as the Western Digital UltraStar DC HC560 20TB and WD Gold 20TB.\nTuned for data center use, the EXOS 20TB is designed for high-capacity servers, enterprise NAS systems, and bulk storage. While the cost is higher than the 18TB models, it is slightly faster and offers enhanced rack space efficiency. Until the rumored microwave-assisted switching (MAS-MAMR) drives come along, the EXOS 20TB is as big a hard drive as you can buy.\nRead our full Seagate EXOS 20TB review\nHow to choose the best NAS hard drive for you\nWhen selecting a NAS hard drive, it is important to consider the capacity, speed, and connectivity options that best meet your needs. Larger capacity hard drives can store more data, while faster hard drives can improve data transfer speeds. It is also important to consider the connectivity options, such as whether the hard drive supports Ethernet or WiFi, as well as the type of data interface (e.g. USB, SATA).\nBest NAS hard drives: Frequently Asked Questions\nWhat is a NAS drive?\nA network attached storage (NAS) drive is a physical storage unit that lets multiple users and devices access data around the clock. Sitting at the center of a data storage spider web, NAS drives are a good option for businesses and enterprises who need to reliably and securely serve up lots of data to lots of users all at once.\nWhat are the benefits of using a NAS hard drive?\nThere are several benefits to using a NAS hard drive, including the ability to access and share stored data from any device on the same network, automatic data backup, and improved data security. NAS hard drives also offer the convenience of being able to access stored data remotely, as long as you have an internet connection.\nCan I use a NAS hard drive as a primary storage device?\nWhile NAS hard drives can be used as a primary storage device, they are typically used as an additional storage option or for file sharing. They may not be suitable for use as a primary storage device for larger files or for high-performance applications, as they may not have the same level of speed and performance as a local hard drive. If you'd like to know more about the different options for primary storage, check out our 'What is an SSD' and 'Is an SSD a hard drive?' explainers for a deeper breakdown.\nCan I use my NAS hard drive for backup purposes?\nYes, many NAS hard drives offer automatic backup capabilities, allowing you to easily and securely store important data as a backup. Some NAS hard drives also offer cloud backup options, allowing you to store data. It's a good idea to supplement any existing with the best cloud storage or the best cloud backup. We also recommend additional backups via any of the best SSD options for faster performance, or the best external hard drives.\nToday's best NAS drive deals\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.\nNamed by the CTA as a CES 2020 Media Trailblazer for his science and technology reporting, John specializes in all areas of computer science, including industry news, hardware reviews, PC gaming, as well as general science writing and the social impact of the tech industry.\nYou can find him online on Bluesky @johnloeffler.bsky.social\n- Collin Probst\n- Desire AthowManaging Editor, TechRadar Pro\n- Luke HughesStaff Writer"
