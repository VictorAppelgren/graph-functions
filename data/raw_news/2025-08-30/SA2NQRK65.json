  "description": "These Ryobi gadgets, while not necessarily tools, are affordable, will provide plenty of utility and are highly rated by the brand's customer base.",
  "content": "5 Cool Ryobi Gadgets That Are Highly Rated By Users\n\nRyobi is constantly churning out new tools, tech, and gadgets, each one building on the brand's stalwart legacy. Decked in its iconic green and black color scheme, Ryobi gadgets offer customers tons of functionality at a lower price compared to higher-end brands like Bosch and Milwaukee. The company has expanded well beyond hand and power tools to include lifestyle gear and outdoor gadgets, ideal for the average homeowner or DIY'er. And, as with all tool brands, some items in the company's product range are more highly celebrated than others. One thing that keeps Ryobi customers coming back is its interchangeable batteries. Many of its tools and gear are part of the ONE family, where you can use the same rechargeable batteries for different gadgets. This gives you more value and use from your purchases, encouraging customers to give more Ryobi products a chance. Whether you have a few items in your Ryobi collection or want to start building one, here are five of the coolest Ryobi gadgets that its fans swear by, based on star ratings and user reviews.\n\nRyobi's 18-volt ONE+ Whisper Series 7.5-inch Bucket Top Misting Fan Kit cools up to 14 feet with a whisper-quiet fan and misting function. It's one of the most useful Ryobi products that doesn't classify as a tool. It fits directly onto a standard five-gallon bucket, which you can find at any home improvement store (or the Firehouse Subs pickle bucket). Just fill the bucket with water and drop in the attached hose on the fan, and you'll have hours of fine, cool mist. Ryobi claims its bucket-top fan is 44% quieter than previous versions, earning it a spot in its Whisper Series product lineup. If you don't have a bucket or don't want to deal with the heft and weight of a water-filled basin, the fan includes a hose attachment for a limitless supply of water. It fits any standard garden hose, and you can control the level of mist with two separate settings. Since it's part of the ONE+ series, you can use any 18-volt ONE+ battery, which is handy if you already have some Ryobi tools in this family. The fan head pivots up or down to let you direct the airflow. It's a great companion for tailgates, baseball dugouts, sports field sidelines, family cookouts, or anywhere where you appreciate a little cooling. The Bucket Top Misting Fan Kit is available on the Ryobi website for $99, which includes one rechargeable battery.\n\nAnother Ryobi 18-volt ONE+ family member, this battery power source and charging kit is a game-changer for anyone who is frequently on the move. The average power bank typically offers USB and USB-C charging outlets, which limits you as far as what you can charge. This battery power source doesn't stop there. It includes two standard USB outlets, a USB-C port, and a traditional 120-volt AC outlet for charging larger devices, such as a laptop. It delivers up to 150 total watts of power, with a battery life long enough to charge your phone up to six times before needing a replacement battery. In addition to multiple outlets that let you power multiple devices at once, it also includes an onboard LED light to brighten work areas, camp sites, or other spaces. It's a productivity tool that regular power banks can't compete with. Plus, the charger comes with a wall adapter, allowing it to charge your Ryobi battery without a separate device. You can get the power inverter and a battery from the Ryobi website for $129, or just the power inverter for $79.97.\n\nBluetooth speakers are a dime a dozen these days, but Ryobi's speaker with Bluetooth offer a few perks you won't find with other speakers. First and foremost, it runs on the Ryobi 18V ONE+ batteries that you may already have, giving you up to 10 hours of runtime. You get a 125-foot range too, so even if you have to walk away from the party, the music can keep going. Also included are a USB charging port so you can charge your phone or tablet from the speaker, voice prompts that tell you when your speaker is on or off or connected to Bluetooth, a top handle for easy carrying, and two three-inch speakers for better sound coverage. It comes in the classic green and black Ryobi color scheme and features real buttons (not touchscreen) on the top. All this comes in a package under four pounds, making it a portable option for your next adventure. You can get this speaker on Ryobi's website for $89, not including the battery or charger. The brand also has other Bluetooth speakers in varying sizes and price points, depending on your preferences.\n\nSociety has come a long way from the days of hand pumping bicycle tires and basketballs. Nowadays, digital inflators do all the heavy lifting and remove the guesswork from the process. Ryobi's lineup includes a high-pressure digital inflator, where you can use the digital screen to set the exact PSI you need and let the tool take over. This gives you precise filling up to 160 PSI, and it usually takes just seconds to do. The digital inflator uses the 18-volt ONE+ battery system to complement your other Ryobi tools and gear. The tool kit also includes a sports ball needle, a presta valve adaptor, and a pinch valve adaptor, each of which clips onto the inflator so all the pieces are in one spot. You can get the digital inflator for about $30 on the Ryobi website, or get the inflator with a battery and charger for under $70.\n\nGood lighting always comes in handy, which is why this 360-degree LED light is a no-brainer. It features four panels of LED lights, one on each side, for a total of 3,800 lumens that light all directions simultaneously. Each panel can pivot to direct light where you need it. It's the brightest light in Ryobi's extensive lighting collection, plus it uses the 18V ONE+ battery system for long-lasting power. You can choose from four different brightness modes (low, medium, high, or single panel) to control the intensity of the light and preserve your battery life. On top, you'll find a handle for easy carrying as well as a hook for hanging, in case you need to go hands-free. It's a favorite product for job sites, tailgates, campsites, or anywhere that a flashlight or traditional light source won't cut it. The 360-degree LED light is on the Ryobi website for $99, with the battery and charger sold separately.",

      "text": "9 Ryobi Tools And Gear You Need For The Perfect Tailgate\nTailgating is a cornerstone of sports culture, giving fans a place to celebrate before, during, and after a big game. Whether you have a ticket or just plan to hear the cheers from the parking lot, tailgating has become a social phenomenon just as vibrant and essential as the game itself. It's a time to grill up burgers, blast your favorite tunes, make new friends, and even play a little parking lot cornhole. To craft the perfect tailgate, you'll need a few essential tools and tech, and Ryobi has you covered.\nRyobi is known for its budget-friendly gear in a bright green color scheme. The brand has evolved beyond power tools to cover lifestyle gear and portable tech that makes your life easier. Plus, you don't have to spend a fortune to get decent products, which makes them great assets for an afternoon of tailgating. Stock up on these Ryobi essentials that will help you create the perfect tailgate setup.\n18V ONE Hybrid VERSE LINK Bluetooth Stereo\nMusic has a way of bringing people together (just like tailgating), which is why the Ryobi 18V ONE+ Hybrid VERSE LINK Bluetooth Stereo makes a great addition to your tailgating lineup. It's designed to deliver better sound in outdoor spaces with dual speakers and the option to connect additional VERSE speakers. The stereo has a Bluetooth range of up to 250 feet. And similar to non-portable stereo systems, you can control your sound experience with treble, bass, and voice equalizer features.\nThe Hybrid Verse Link uses the 18V ONE+ rechargeable battery system, which is handy if you have other Ryobi tools in this family. It's ideal for tailgating because of its long battery life, with up to 12 hours of continuous runtime with a 6Ah battery. Or, you can plug in an extension cord for unlimited runtime if you're near a power source. It's small and lightweight enough to carry to your tailgating site without breaking a sweat. You can get Hybrid VERSE LINK Bluetooth Stereo at The Home Depot for $199, with the 18V ONE+ battery and charger sold separately.\nUSB Lithium VERSE Compact Speaker Kit\nIf you like the idea of bringing a portable Bluetooth speaker to the tailgate but don't want to splurge on the Hybrid VERSE LINK stereo, the USB Lithium VERSE Compact Speaker Kit offers an attractive alternative. Smaller, lighter, and less expensive, this compact Bluetooth speaker offers high-quality sound in a compact footprint. It's dustproof and waterproof, which makes it ideal for outdoor situations like tailgates.\nDespite its small size, this speaker has the same Bluetooth range as the Hybrid VERSE LINK stereo \u2014 up to 250 feet. Compared to the larger speaker, it lacks the customizable sound features and long run time. It also uses a rechargeable lithium battery, rather than the 18V ONE+. However, the compact speaker does have the option to connect multiple VERSE speakers together to amplify your sound. It also includes a lanyard so you can hang your speaker from your tailgate, chair, table, or wherever suits you. The speaker kit includes the Bluetooth speaker, a rechargeable lithium battery, and a charging cable.\n40V HP Brushless Hybrid Whisper Series 20-inch Air Cannon\nIn many parts of the country, fall tailgates can feel like summertime. To keep the party cool, Ryobi's Air Cannon delivers an impressive breeze in a relatively lightweight design. The cordless fan sits on a sturdy frame with two wheels and an angled handle for easy rolling into your tailgate site. It uses a 40V rechargeable battery that gives you up to 34 hours of runtime. The fan can pivot 180 degrees to direct air anywhere you need it, and it's quiet enough so that it doesn't drown out the music or the cheers from the stands.\nIf you forgot to charge your fan beforehand or just want to conserve your battery, you can plug in an extension cord for all-day power. A 20-inch fan diameter covers a wide area and can keep your entire party cool. Choose from three different speed settings to control air flow and maximize your battery life. The 40V HP Brushless Hybrid Whisper Series 20-inch Air Cannon retails for $229, with the battery and charger sold separately.\n18V ONE Whisper Series 7.5-inch Bucket Top Misting Fan\nIf you prefer a personal-sized fan instead of (or in addition to) the Air Cannon, Ryobi's Bucket Top Misting Fan is a sound choice. It's smaller and also lighter, plus it won't take up as much space in your vehicle. It uses the popular 18V ONE+ battery system, which gives you several hours of runtime.\nSimilar to the Air Cannon, this smaller fan pivots up and down to allow you to point the air where you need it. The bucket fan is designed to fit the top of a 5-gallon bucket (not included), which you can fill with water and use the attached fan hose to create mist. The hose also attaches to a standard garden hose if you have one available at your tailgate. You can choose between two fan speed settings and two mist settings to give you as much cooling as you desire. You can buy the fan only for $69, or get the fan, a battery, and a charger for $99. On a hot day, it definitely feels like one of the most useful Ryobi products that isn't a power tool.\n18V ONE 24-quart Hybrid Power Cooler\nFor tailgaters who like to keep their beers as cold as they can, Ryobi's 18V ONE+ 24-quart Hybrid Power Cooler doesn't disappoint. This Ryobi's new smart cooler is more like a portable fridge and freezer on wheels. It's powered by an 18V ONE+ rechargeable battery and keeps food and drinks cold for up to 35 hours. Even better, it keeps your goods cold without ice, so there's no need to drain the cooler or restock on ice.\nOne of the many lesser-known high-tech products from Ryobi, this is the Swiss army knife of tailgating coolers. You can set the temperature depending on what you're cooling, with options ranging from -4 degrees to 68 degrees Fahrenheit. It includes an onboard battery indicator light so you can see when you need to swap out power sources. If you run out of battery power, you can plug in an extension cord for unlimited cooling power. A folding handle and wheels make it easy to bring this heavy-duty cooler to your tailgate. It also features a built-in bottle opener, a USB-A charging port to charge small devices, and enough space to cool a whole case of beer (or sodas, waters, whatever your preference). Get the cooler, a 12V car power port adaptor, and a 120V power adaptor for $399.\n80V 1000W Power Source\nFrom outdoor speakers to phones and lighting, there's no end to the need for power when you're tailgating. Ryobi makes several options for portable power, including the 80V 1000W Power Source. It's compact enough to fit in the storage pocket behind your vehicle's driver's seat, yet powerful enough to fuel your grill, TV, or other devices that contribute to your tailgating experience.\nThis product from Ryobi includes multiple outlet types on one device: 1 USB-C port and 2 USB-A ports for small devices like your smartphone, tablet, rechargeable fans, or similar devices, and 2 AC ports for items you didn't think you could bring to a tailgate. Things like refrigerators, slow cookers, air fryers, or corded fans are no longer off limits. You're not at the mercy of a fixed power source at your tailgate site to get the comfort and convenience you crave. And when you're not tailgating, the power source also comes in handy during power outages \u2014 you can even use it indoors without the risk of emissions. It's also super quiet compared to generators and can operate for up to 20 hours on certain devices. You can get the new 80V 1000W Power Source for $279.\nMesh basket\nWhen you're tailgating, there's no end to the number of odds and ends you need for a good time. A good storage system will help you stay organized so you can find what you need when you need it. If you're a fan of Ryobi and want to stick to the green-and-black theme, Ryobi's mesh basket gives you a solution. Part of the modular LINK tool storage system, the mesh basket has a weight capacity of 20 pounds, making it ideal for storing your loose tailgate items and preventing them from getting lost in your trunk or backseat.\nTechnically, the mesh basket is designed for tool storage in your garage. It's one of many products in the LINK modular lineup, which also includes hard-cased storage boxes, tool cabinets, wire shelves, and accessories. But if you're looking for a durable, convenient solution that matches your other Ryobi gear, this basket works in a pinch. It's made of reinforced polyester and includes two side pockets to make smaller items more accessible. Use it to pack your picnic supplies, snacks, paper goods, extra 18V ONE+ batteries, bug spray, sunscreen, or anything else you need for your tailgate.\nLINK 17-inch soft sided cooler\nIf you don't need the size and power of the hybrid cooler, Ryobi's 17-inch soft-sided cooler gives you a decent alternative. It's smaller and more lightweight, which makes it easier to move and carry. While it doesn't use the battery power of the Hybrid cooler, its insulation can hold ice for up to 24 hours, which is more than enough time to cool your drinks and snacks for a tailgate.\nThe soft sided cooler includes a shoulder strap with a comfort pad so you can carry it with you pretty much anywhere. It's roomy enough to hold up to 24 12-ounce cans of your favorite drink. And unlike some soft-sided coolers, this one doesn't sweat or leak. It also features a hidden top storage pocket where you can hide your keys, wallet, or other small items. Or, you can use it to separate your food and drink while still keeping your food chilled. There's another pocket on the front in case you need extra storage. You can get the soft-sided cooler for about $60 on Ryobi's website.\nUSB Lithium LED Magnetic Clamp Light Kit\nTailgates can start in the early mornings and last until the wee hours of the night. When things go late, good lighting will make or break the experience. Ryobi's lineup of portable lighting give you more ways to keep the party going. One option is the Lithium LED Magnetic Clamp Light Kit. The clamp design lets you attach the light virtually anywhere and adjust the head to shine light wherever you need it most.\nThe light includes three brightness modes, giving you more flexibility based on the time of day, your location, and how much battery power you have. The light is dustproof and water resistant, so you can use it in just about any type of weather. With the rechargeable lithium battery, you can get up to 10 hours of continuous runtime (brighter settings may lower the total battery runtime). The kit includes the clamp light, a rechargeable battery, and a charger for about $50."

      "text": "6 Of The Most Useful Ryobi Products That Aren't Tools\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nThe Ryobi hardware brand, as you'd expect, specializes in hardware. The brand is well known for its battery-backed power tools and workshop helpers, from power drills to lawnmowers to pressure washers. Ryobi is a consistently good brand to visit the hardware store for if you're in the market for helpful and reliable tools. Even if you're not in the market for tools, though, don't go walking out the door just yet.\nIn addition to its workshop and job site power tools, Ryobi also offers various more mundane products, including household helpers, convenient everyday implements, and even gadgets that won't go amiss at your next camping trip or lawn party. Not only can these products be helpful in various situations, but since they're built by a hardware company, you can bet that they'll stand the test of time and whatever dirty work you can throw at them.\nWe've selected six non-tool Ryobi products for you to peruse, all available at your local Home Depot and backed up by product users and hardware professionals. More information on our selection process is available at the bottom of the page.\n18V ONE+ 150-Watt Power Source\nOne of Ryobi's major claims to fame is its line of heavy-duty rechargeable battery packs, collectively known as the ONE+ system. These batteries are designed primarily with Ryobi's power tools in mind, providing clean, consistent electricity and easy recharging. But what if you could put that power toward something a little more practical, like charging your phone?\nEnter the 150-watt Power Source. This compact and convenient device features a standard 120V AC outlet, as well as a pair of USB-A ports for charging small electronics. Just snap a Ryobi 18V battery pack onto the bottom, and you've got enough juice to power a laptop for an entire day or recharge your phone six times over. This power capacity, paired with the built-in LED light, makes the Power Source indispensable for sudden power outages.\nThe Ryobi 150-Watt Power Source is available at Home Depot for $49.00, where it has a 4.7 out of five-star rating. The device comes highly recommended by disaster readiness site Bug Out Bag Builder, which applauded its small size and cable-less design. This makes it great for trips off the grid, as it easily fits into a travel bag.\nHobby Station\nWhen you create your own hobby workshop at home, things can quickly dissolve into a state of semi-organized chaos. Tools and batteries lay scattered around the table, and a thin layer of sawdust always seems to cover everything. If you need a linchpin for your burgeoning hobby spot, try Ryobi's Hobby Station.\nThe Hobby Station is designed to work with Ryobi's various rotary tools, giving you a sturdy and convenient way to hold a tool in place while you drill, sand, and otherwise work with soft materials like craft wood. The center gauge has a thread to hold your rotary tool, as well as two inches of adjustment for ideal precision. You can also rotate the gauge 90 degrees for angled work and hang other tools from the telescoping top hook. What's especially cool is the bottom panel, which features a built-in vacuum port for easy sawdust cleanup and two covered nooks for accessory storage.\nThe Ryobi Hobby Station is available at Home Depot for $99.00, where it has a user score of 4.4 out of five. YouTube channel Shop Tool Reviews notes that while the Hobby Station isn't quite sturdy enough for professional-grade work, its convenience and reliability make it excellent for hobby-grade work, especially since it's compatible with any cordless rotary tool from Ryobi or other brands.\nUSB Lithium LED Magnifying Light\nOftentimes in life, whenever you need to light up a small space, you also want to get a better look at it, such as when you're trying to find something small in a dark basement or reading an old book in the early hours. A traditional flashlight, on its own, provides light but no clarity, plus it can be a bit bulky. Give your eyes the help they need with Ryobi's LED Magnifying Light.\nThis convenient and compact inspection device is a seamless combination of a handheld magnifying glass and an LED light. The lens boasts crystal-clear 3X magnification, while the circular light provides 200 lumens of light right at whatever you're looking at. The included USB lithium battery, when fully charged, can power the light for up to 16 hours consecutively. As a bonus, it comes with a microfiber bag for carrying the magnifier and cleaning the lens.\nThe Ryobi Magnifying Light is available at Home Depot for $39.97, where it has a user rating of 4.6 out of five. Users have called it an excellent addition to a toolbox, workshop, or office. Several users added that it's great for reading small print on tiny electronics manuals, such as those included with chargers.\nWhisper Series 7.5-Inch Bucket Top Misting Fan\nWhen it gets hot out, the first things to come out of storage are the portable personal fans. A little extra breeze is certainly nice amid a scorcher, but just moving air around won't give you the cool relief you really need. Why not supplement that breeze with some refreshing mist?\nThe Ryobi Bucket Top Misting Fan is your best summer pal, combining a powerful standing fan with a refreshing spritz of mist. This 840 FPM fan features a built-in hose, allowing it to draw water from either a standard garden hose or a bucket beneath the fan. The water is sprayed from two front nozzles, creating a lovely mist with up to 14 feet of coverage. With the power of a Ryobi 18V battery pack, you can run the fan continuously for up to five hours, adjusting your preferences with two fan speeds and two misting settings.\nThe Ryobi Misting Fan is available at Home Depot for $99, where it has a user rating of 4.6 out of five. Kenny Koehler of Pro Tool Reviews called the fan \"must-have summer gear,\" praising its efficient water usage and wide-reaching mist spray. He also complimented the device's relatively quiet 52 decibels of operating sound, fitting for a device in Ryobi's Whisper series.\nLINK 17-Inch Soft-Sided Cooler\nThe age of the classic plastic or metal lunchbox is long since passed. A little hard-material box just doesn't cut it when it comes to keeping your snacks and drinks cool for an entire day. What you really need is something that'll preserve your lunch as long as necessary, with a few convenient options for transportation.\nRyobi's Soft-Sided Cooler will be at your side whether on your way to work or off to the beach. This 17-inch over-shoulder cooler is large enough to fit up to 24 soda cans, which means it's more than big enough to hold some sandwiches and water bottles. The outside of the cooler features sweat-wicking fabric for those traveling on foot in the sun, while the inside features strong enough insulation to retain ice for up to 24 straight hours. Plus, the bottom of the cooler features a slot for Ryobi's LINK system storage products. If you've got a stack of bins going, just clip the cooler to the top.\nThe LINK Soft Cooler is available at Home Depot for $59.97, where it has a user rating of 4.9 out of five. Buyers have said that the cooler can keep both ice and food perfectly cool for an entire day or more, whether at a worksite or in the home. One user noted that the molded LINK base is great for keeping the cooler upright and steady on any surface.\nONE+ Bug Zapper\nOne of the biggest barriers to enjoying the great outdoors is the ever-present annoyance of bugs. It's hard to appreciate the autumn breeze, for instance, when said breeze delivers mosquitos into your face. To keep bugs out of your or anyone else's face, give them something a little spicier to go flying into.\nThe Ryobi Bug Zapper is perfect for all kinds of outdoor settings, including your backyard, a campsite, a farm, and more. With the power of an 18V battery pack, this mighty tower delivers an electric punch of 2,550 volts to any bug that flies into its mesh, attracted by the built-in UV light. Beneath the mesh is a removable disposal tray, catching any zapped bugs for convenient cleanup. The zapper provides bug-busting coverage to a full acre of land, ensuring nothing will get near you or your stuff.\nThe Ryobi Bug Zapper is available at Home Depot for $132, where it has a user rating of 4.3 out of five. YouTube channel Tools & Stuff called the zapper its favorite Ryobi product, as not only is watching bugs get zapped helpful and entertaining, but the included handle has it conveniently double as a lantern.\nSelection methodology\nThe preceding Ryobi products were chosen amongst high-ranking offerings on both Home Depot and Ryobi's own digital storefronts. Preference was given to items with professional reviewer recommendations and/or at least a four out of five rating on one or both storefronts."

      "text": "How To Find The Right Battery For Your Ryobi Tool\nOne of the Ryobi hardware brand's best selling points is its wide array of rechargeable battery packs. Whether you're using handheld power tools or driving around on an electric ride-on lawn mower, Ryobi has a battery pack for the job, providing clean energy and consistent performance with less rumbling and fume-belching than a gas-powered tool. While Ryobi's batteries are designed to be highly adaptable, they're not quite universal in their applications.\nDifferent Ryobi tools need different Ryobi battery packs based on their size and output. You can purchase Ryobi tools standalone from retailers like Home Depot if you already have a battery pack at home, but if it ends up being the wrong battery pack for that particular tool, you'll have to drag yourself back to the store to buy the one that you actually need. To prevent these kinds of battery mismatches from occurring, learn here about the differences between Ryobi's various battery ecosystems, how to identify them at a glance, and perhaps most importantly, which kinds of batteries can snap onto which kinds of tools.\nRyobi battery pack types\nBefore we get into identification, let's broadly cover Ryobi's battery pack types. Ryobi maintains four separate ecosystems for its battery-powered products, differentiated by the size and output of the batteries in question, as well as the size and application of their relevant tools.\nThe smallest Ryobi batteries are the USB lithium packs. These pen-sized packs are used for portable, low-power tools like small flashlights and hobby crafting tools. They can be recharged by plugging them into an ordinary USB charger or port.\nThe second system is the ONE+ line, Ryobi's most prominent battery ecosystem. These 18V battery packs are used to power the lion's share of handheld Ryobi tools, from power drills to vacuum cleaners and pruning chainsaws, as well as fun devices like music speakers and coolers. These batteries require a dedicated charging cradle to juice up.\nFor larger, professional-grade tools, Ryobi uses the 40V battery line. These heftier battery packs are designed to output a level of power comparable to a gas-powered engine. They are used on appliances like leaf blowers, power washers, and full-sized chainsaws. Like the ONE+ line, these batteries need a particular charger.\nFinally, the biggest boys on the block are the 80V batteries. These packs are used exclusively for pushing and ride-on lawnmowers, providing the highest power output possible to match a gas mower. The 80V batteries need a specialized, wall-mountable charger.\nCheck the box and manual\nWhen attempting to identify a match between a Ryobi tool and a battery pack, the brand provides plenty of identifying information on the product packaging. If you've just purchased a new Ryobi tool or battery pack, or are still looking at one in the store, take a good look at the box it comes in. If it's part of the ONE+ line, for example, the word \"ONE+\" should be featured prominently on the front of the box. The same goes for the USB lithium, 40V, and 80V lines; check the box, and you should find the answer.\nIf you've already disposed of the box, you can also find identifying information in the item's user manual. While the manual may not have the big, flashy logo for its relevant battery line printed on the cover, it should say which battery type it uses in plain text. If you have a Ryobi stick vacuum, for example, the cover of the manual should have \"Ryobi ONE+ HP Stick Vacuum\" printed in large font. Even if it doesn't say \"ONE+,\" as long as the name of the tool has \"18V\" in it somewhere, you've got a ONE+ tool on your hands.\nCheck the tool itself\nIf you've lost all the packaging and the manual for your Ryobi tool or battery pack, don't worry. The tools and packs can still tell you everything you need to know. For one thing, in a nifty bit of branding, all Ryobi battery packs have their relevant system printed somewhere on their body. Whether it's a USB lithium, ONE+, 40V, or 80V, the system name should be clearly visible on a printed sticker on the battery.\nIf the sticker is missing or worn out, then you can determine what kind of battery you're using by inspecting the battery's connectors, as well as the connector ports on your tools. Every Ryobi battery system has a completely distinct connector shape; you can't even plug the wrong battery into a tool from a different system.\nUSB lithium tools have a small compartment slot that the battery pack can slide right into, usually with some kind of closable cover. ONE+ batteries are square-shaped with a distinctive peg jutting out of the top, which should plug into a cylindrical slot on the tool with the rest of the pack still sticking out. 40V batteries are bulky rectangles with connecting rails on the bottom, which slide and snap into place on an external battery slot on the tool. 80V packs look like little suitcases and need to be wholly inserted into a dedicated battery compartment on a Ryobi lawnmower. Obviously, these wouldn't even fit on any handheld Ryobi tools.\nCan you use current Ryobi batteries with older tools?\nIt's worth noting that the current framework of Ryobi battery packs has only existed for around 20 years, while the brand itself has existed for much longer. Prior to Ryobi's current lithium-ion-powered ONE+ system, it used nickel-cadmium batteries for its 18V tools.\nThat said, Ryobi has used the same connector shape for all of its rechargeable 18V tools from the start. While the precise location and efficacy of the connectors do differ between generations, it is possible to power an older Ryobi tool with a new Ryobi battery, though the reliability of the output may be lessened. The other battery pack types were introduced at the same time or since the ONE+ line, so there aren't any older USB lithium, 40V, or 80V packs to worry about.\nOn a similar note, outside of the United States, Ryobi's battery brandings are a bit different. In Australia, for example, there's a 36V system instead of a 40V. However, the 36V Ryobi battery pack has the same connectors as a 40V pack and can be used with the same tools. Just remember to be careful if you're plugging an Australian charger into an American outlet due to voltage differences.\n[Image by Greg Hume via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY-SA 3.0]"

      "text": "10 Ryobi Tools That Are No-Brainers At Their Price\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nWhether you own your own home or you're a renter, there's a good chance you are going to need some power tools at some point. Whether it's routine maintenance around the house, a small upgrade or two, or just a project you want to work on, a solid power tool is something you'll come back to over and over.\nRyobi has been making power tools since the 1960s and has become one of the more common names in the category. They're well-built, reliable, and cover a wide range of categories, which is important because when you're picking up a new tool, you'll often want to stay within the same ecosystem since batteries and chargers won't be interchangeable between brands.\nIf you're on team Ryobi, you probably already have a few batteries and chargers already, and if you don't, we recommend the 4.0 Ah batteries for their great combination of longevity and weight. As of this writing, there's a 2-pack of batteries with charger for $99. As for what they'll be powering, here are five tools we recommend that are no-brainers at their price.\nRyobi One 18V Cordless \u00bd-inch Drill/Driver Kit\nIf there is such a thing as a \"classic\" tool that everyone needs to have, it's probably a drill/driver. It's a tool that is used on just about any project you can think of. A drill can be used for drilling holes, screwing and unscrewing screws and bolts, putting things together, taking them apart, and just about anything in between.\nThe drill/driver we selected is currently priced at $59 as of this writing, and it comes with one 1.5Ah battery and a charger. That battery will be interchangeable with other Ryobi tools as well. If you are a woodworker, we'd recommend this 2-Tool Combo Kit that includes the drill/driver and a circular saw. It's currently $149, so the more, the merrier. This kit also includes two batteries, a charger, and a carrying bag for everything.\nRyobi also has larger combo kits with even more tools in them. It's not a bad idea to get a lot of tools as a bundle if you have the budget (and the need for them), but if you want to stick to the basics, you can't go wrong with a good drill/driver.\n12V Cordless Rotary Tool\nA rotary tool is a little more niche, but you'll be surprised how quickly this tool can pay for itself when you're working on smaller projects or even a bigger project that requires a more noble tool. A rotary tool spins its attached tips up to 35,000 rpm, and the different tips determine what kind of job you can do. There are saw blades, grinder tips, brush tips for polishing, cutting tips, and more. This kit comes with a number of different tooltips which will cover a lot of different projects, but there are so many more tips you can pick up.\nThe best part about this tool is that it's completely cordless and doesn't have a separate battery. The 12V battery is integrated into the tool and charges via USB. The downside to that is the rotary tool won't last as long as its 18V counterparts, plus the battery is not interchangeable.\nStill, it's truly wireless, making it easy to get into nooks and crannies that might otherwise be inaccessible when attached to a battery base. If you prefer a long-lasting battery with a base attachment, Ryobi makes that too. The 12V cordless rotary tool and the 18V rotary tool (with the base) are available for $79 and $89, respectively, as of this writing.\nONE 18V Cordless 1 Gallon Wet/Dry Vacuum\nThe most important part of any job is the cleanup. You can build the most beautiful bookshelf man has ever seen, but if you leave a pile of sawdust and discarded screws in the living room, nobody is going to be happy. Ryobi has a cute little 1-gallon wet/dry vac that is battery-powered, so there's no need to worry about cables. One gallon isn't a ton of volume, so you may want to spring for the 3-gallon vacuum. The 1-gallon vacuum is $49.97 and the 3-gallon is $129 as of the time of this writing.\nThe bonus that the 1-gallon vacuum gives you is storage. It comes with a bracket that allows you to hang it on a wall, which is nice for keeping it out of the way until you need it. Of course, the same batteries that power your vacuum will also work for your other Ryobi tools.\nRyobi 18V Cordless String Trimmer/Edger and Blower/Sweeper\nThis won't apply so much to the renters out there, but if you're a homeowner, you'll need a cordless string trimmer, aka weed whacker, aka weed eater. This combo comes with a blower as well for $203. The blower is useful for blowing grass trimmings off the sidewalk or blowing leaves in the fall. Basically, both tools are part of the lawn maintenance 101 package that every homeowner needs. The string trimmer can also turn 90 degrees to serve as a sidewalk edger as well if you are the sort to go for that crisp look.\nThese tools come with a 4.0 Ah battery and charger, which is great for longevity. So if you're looking for a good string trimmer and a good way to clean up after some yard work, this combo has what you need for a pretty good price.\n12-piece Ryobi Screwdriver set\nNot everything Ryobi makes is electrical, and as much as you might think you'll use a drill/driver for every project around your house, sometimes you just need a good screwdriver. Drills can be bulkier and in some cases a bit of overkill for projects like fixing a leaky faucet or adjusting the tension of a screen door.\nThis 12-piece set has a good mix of large and small drivers in Phillips head, flathead, and star bits. There are also six precision drivers for small projects. Those precision drivers have rotating caps so you can apply consistent pressure. Plus, all the screwdrivers have cushioned handles for comfort and an anti-roll design. There's nothing more frustrating than setting down a screwdriver and finding it in a different place when you come back. These screwdrivers are just $14.97 at the time of this writing, which is a good deal for this wide range of tools.\n18V One High Pressure Digital Inflator\nOne of the top-rated Ryobi air pumps is the brand's 18V One+ High Pressure Digital Inflator \u2014 on Ryobi's website, customers have rated it a near-perfect 4.9 out of five, based on over 180 reviews. It's also very affordably priced, considering you're getting a tool that can quickly inflate sports balls, balloons, and \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 small tires. The inflator can reach up to 160 psi and has an auto shut-off so you can reach the exact pressure you need. It's able to re-inflate a car tire to 32 psi in just 42 seconds.\nA digital pressure gauge on board, the tool will make it easy for you to keep track of your progress by displaying accurate measurements, as well. Also integrated into the inflator is onboard accessory storage, so you can keep the tool, as well as a hose, needle, and adapters all in one place. Its compact size makes it both easy to store and carry around with you. Plus, the 24-inch hose gives you a lot of room to work.\nThe 18V One+ High Pressure Digital Inflator (product code PCL001K1) is just $25, if not less. However, this price does not include the Ryobi 18V battery and charger you'll need to power the cordless inflator.\nUSB Lithium Desktop Vacuum Kit\nNot only does the USB Lithium Desktop Vacuum Kit have a reasonable price, but you're also getting a Ryobi Lithium battery and a USB charging cable along with the useful gadget. The battery can be used with other tools in Ryobi's USB Lithium line, such as the Ryobi USB Soldering Pen and Ryobi USB Electric Screwdriver, and can conveniently be charged via USB-C.\nThat means you can charge it right on your desk, which is great because the tool is perfect for sucking up crumbs and dust from your computer and work area. An included crevice tool can even reach those hard-to-reach spaces in your keyboard debris, as well as your couch cushions. The desktop vacuum is lightweight and has a smartly-designed compact shape that allows you to easily grip it from the top and move it across flat surfaces, like workshop benches, countertops, coffee tables, and desks.\nIts transparent dust cup allows you to see how much dirt you're collecting and if you've accidentally sucked up something important by mistake. It's also easy to remove and empty when needed. Of course, you'll want something stronger for bigger debris, and customers have noted that it's not ideal for pet hair. But, for keeping your workspace tidy, the USB Lithium Desktop Vacuum is a no-brainer.\nThe USB Lithium Desktop Vacuum Kit has product code FVH67K and is available for $59 on Amazon, though you can currently find it for $9 less on Home Depot's website.\n18V One LED Flashlight\nThere are several useful Ryobi lighting accessories that can be handy for working at night or during power outages. Older lighting products made by the brand used incandescent lights, which you can replace with LEDs. However, you can also just buy a new Ryobi 18V One+ LED Flashlight for not that much money. It's a handheld flashlight that weighs less than a pound, but conveniently has an upright design so you can also stand it on a flat surface for hands-free use.\nIts head pivots 130 degrees so you can aim the light toward where you need it most. It has a decent brightness level of 280 lumens and a beam distance of 500 feet. It runs on any Ryobi 18V battery and can last up to 22 hours before needing a recharge.\nWhen you're not using it, you conveniently store it by using the hanging loop built into its body. This loop can also be used if you want to hang the light overhead, as well. It's easy to see why this is one of the highest-rated Ryobi tools available, with a near-perfect 4.9 out of five overall customer score on the brand's website, based on over 400 reviews. The Ryobi 18V One+ LED Flashlight, which has product code PCL660B, is available for $30.\n18V One Cordless Compact Power Scrubber\nWhile it's possible to attach a scrubber to your power drill, an easier option may be to grab yourself a Ryobi 18V One+ Cordless Compact Power Scrubber. The tool has a high performance motor to scrub away tough stains and grime using either the included 6-inch bristle brush or one of many other attachments that are compatible with its triangle connector. It can spin up to 210 rpm.\nWith a Ryobi 18V 4 Ah battery, it can run up to two hours continuously, allowing you to get a good deal of cleaning done. Since the scrubber has an IPX7 water resistance rating, you won't need to worry about splashing \u2014 in fact, the tool can be submerged in up to three feet of water for up to a half hour. It has an upright design that allows you to stand it up when it's not in use, and an ergonomic pistol grip so you can comfortably control exactly where you clean.\nBased on nearly 250 user ratings, the scrubber has an overall customer score of 4.5 out of 5. Some reviews mention that the tool is heavy, though that's subjective \u2014 without a battery, its body weighs just one pound. The Ryobi 18V One+ Cordless Compact Power Scrubber (product code P4510) is at The Home Depot for $79.\nUSB Lithium Power Carver Kit\nOne of the smallest (and coolest) Ryobi tools available is the USB Lithium Power Carver Kit, which comes with the tool, battery, charger, and three different attachments that provide a range of carving options. These attachments include a quarter-inch U-Gouge that can clear large amounts of wood and a 90-degree V-Gouge ideal for relief carving, as well as a straight chisel for more detailed carving and furniture restoration.\nBased on over 180 ratings from Home Depot customers, the Ryobi USB Lithium Power Carver Kit has a solid 4.2 out of five average user score, with 83% of surveyed customers recommending the product. Ryobi calls the tool \u2014 which won a Pro Tool Innovation Award \u2014 the industry's first cordless power carver. It's lightweight and uses a pen-grip design that offers more control when carving.\nThe tool offers a 1-millimeter stroke length and up to 14,000 spm, so you'll be able to use it on many jobs and DIY projects. An onboard LED indicator lets you know the tool's battery life with the push of a button. A similar LED gauge is also included on Ryobi's USB Lithium battery, which powers the device and can be easily recharged with a USB-C cable. The USB Lithium Power Carver Kit has product code FVH51K and costs $69.\nHow these Ryobi tools were selected\nTo ensure that the recommended items in this list of affordable Ryobi tools are actually worth investing in, the reviews and user ratings of customers who've purchased and operated them were referenced. Each recommended tool in this list has a strong user score of at least four out of five stars, based on dozens \u2014 if not hundreds \u2014 of customer ratings, which were sourced from both Ryobi's website, as well as major retailers like Amazon and Home Depot. They were also selected because of their utility \u2014 especially when compared to their relatively low cost. Whether you're a woodworker, repairman, or just trying to keep your home clean, you'll almost certainly get a lot of use out of one or more of these recommended Ryobi tools."

      "text": "The 5 Best Ryobi 18V Tools, According To Users\nRyobi is one of the biggest names in powered tools and accessories, readily offered both on the brand's own online storefront and at major hardware chains like Home Depot. The sheer ubiquity of Ryobi's products has made it popular amongst hardware and D.I.Y. enthusiasts, especially the company's 18V tools and products, all powered by the same type of swappable, rechargeable battery packs.\nWhether you're looking to become a Ryobi brand faithful or just want some assorted tools to fill out your work truck, there's almost definitely at least one Ryobi 18V tool available that would meet your expectations. Of course, there are over 300 Ryobi 18V products on offer, so if you're not quite sure where to start, the best course of action is to look to the users. Luckily, when users really love their Ryobi 18V tools, they're not shy talking about it, with both experts and enthusiasts on YouTube and the casual comments of Reddit singing the praises of various products.\nONE+ 18V 18-Gauge Brushless AirStrike Brad Nailer\nWhen you're in the midst of a demanding home renovation project, it's a waste of both time and energy to manually pound nails into wooden baseboards and molding. That's what's nice about having a brad nailer on deck; you just pull the trigger, and off goes the nail into the wall. The only drawback of some nailers is that they require an attached air compressor to build up the necessary pressure, which limits your mobility. Ryobi's 18V AirStrike brad nailer doesn't need a compressor and can go wherever you need it to.\nThis nailer utilizes Ryobi's proprietary AirStrike technology, generating the necessary air pressure for powerful, penetrative nailing within the device itself, no hoses or compressors necessary. On a single charge from an attached 18V battery pack, this nailer can sink up to 2,250 nails a little over 2 inches deep into hardwood surfaces. You can also adjust the drive depth without any tools, as well as switch between single-shot and rapid-action modes for pounding in as few or as many nails as your project demands. While it's not as powerful as some brad nailers out there, YouTuber markthomasbuilder says it's great for light renovation projects like door and window molding.\nONE+ 18V 6 in. Pruning Mini Chainsaw\nAs nice as it is to have a healthy spattering of trees in your backyard, keeping them from becoming overgrown and taking over everything can be a bit of an undertaking. Thick, healthy branches are too strong to snap off with your bare hands, but breaking out a full-sized chainsaw might be a bit too excessive for simple backyard work. It's in these situations and more that a handheld pruning chainsaw might prove beneficial. As it happens, that's exactly what Ryobi offers with its 18V pruning mini chainsaw, and as pointed out by Pro Tool Reviews, it's the highest-performing pruning chainsaw the brand currently has on offer.\nThis little rascal features an oil-free brushless motor, chopping through tree limbs up to 6 inches in thickness. This makes it excellent not just for maintaining the foliage in your backyard, but also cleaning loose branches out of an off-grid campsite. It'd certainly fit in with a camping set, as it's compact enough to comfortably fit into a rucksack and doesn't need to have bar and chain oil continuously applied. Just snap on an 18V battery pack, and you get over 65 clean cuts, more than enough to saw your way through many wood-heavy situations.\nONE+ HP 18V 4-Mode 1/2 in. Impact Wrench\nIf you work regularly with cars, then an impact wrench is a borderline necessity for your tool kit. While you could technically loosen and tighten the hefty bolts on your car's wheels or engine with a regular socket wrench, it would take a lot of time and force, leaving you tired after loosening a single bolt. A powerful, resilient impact wrench reduces that multi-minute endeavor down to a few seconds and a quick trigger pull. As highlighted by YouTube channel STREET MACHINE, power and resilience is exactly what you'll find in Ryobi's 18V 1/2 inch impact wrench.\nThis portable tornado of a tool packs up to 600 lb-ft of breakaway torque and 450 lb-ft of fastening torque, more than enough to yank any errant bolts right out, then swiftly drive in a fresh one in record time. The wrench is equipped with a four-mode selector for low, medium, and high-power settings, as well as an auto mode that regulates tightening speed and force to prevent over and under-tightening. The 1/2 inch anvil on the front is also equipped with a friction ring, which makes swapping out sockets much faster and simpler.\nONE+ 18V LINK Cordless 3 Gal. Wet/Dry Vacuum\nUnless you happen to be a supernaturally coordinated individual, odds are good that sooner or later, you'll drop something on the floor that you'd rather not have down there. Every workshop, garage, and in-progress renovation should have a vacuum on standby for this precise purpose, both for dry debris like sawdust and wet messes like spilled water. For cleaning up either kind of mess, and doing so in an efficient manner, users of the Ryobi subreddit have professed a fondness for the 18V LINK 3 gallon wet/dry vacuum.\nThis vacuum looks like an unassuming little suitcase, but that's because both its suction mechanism and debris storage are all integrated into a single, convenient package. Just plug the hose in and attach your nozzle of choice, plug in an 18V battery pack, and you're ready to capture all kinds of messes. Since it's lightweight and compact, you can carry the whole thing around with you as you vacuum the entire room, then nestle it into a tight nook on your shelf afterward. What's nice about this particular vacuum is that it's part of Ryobi's LINK storage system, allowing you to clip it onto a stack of other compatible containers and devices so you always have convenient access to it.\nONE+ 18V Cordless High Pressure Inflator\nFor those who have kids, a recurring task you may not have originally considered is the constant need to inflate and deflate things. This includes pool toys and water safety devices, various kinds of balls, bike tires, and more. If you've got a particularly rambunctious child, all of the inflatables are probably going to need to be topped off fairly regularly. This is precisely why the users of the Ryobi subreddit highly recommend the 18V high-pressure inflator, with one user using it so often that it needed to be replaced with another.\nThis inflation device is small enough to comfortably fit in a discrete nook in your car, but don't write it off for being compact. Its powerful internal motor can quickly and easily inflate just about anything with a PSI rating between 0 and 150. Additionally, unlike with trying to inflate things with an old bike pump, this inflator has a programmable digital display, providing you with exactly as much air as you need, and without any physical exertion required. The inflator comes bundled with a hose, a sports needle, and a high-pressure nozzle, so it can handle anything from a simple basketball to a deflated car tire."

      "text": "10 Ryobi Tools And Gear That Will Come In Handy During The Fall Season\nFall means shorter days, colder temperatures, and lots of home and yard maintenance to prepare for the winter. But it's also a busy season of fun, from fall camping to tailgates and festivals. No matter where life takes you this autumn, Ryobi has a few tools that can make things easier.\nKnown for its budget-friendliness and bright green designs, Ryobi tools mostly cater to homeowners and DIYers. You can find a full line of power and hand tools bearing the brand's name, as well as products that go beyond construction needs \u2014 everything from soft-sided coolers to hobby stations. Whether you have a few DIY projects on your to-do list, you're planning an epic camping trip with the family, or you just want to spend some time outdoors, these 10 Ryobi finds could be great assets for your fall adventures. And given how often Ryobi sells tools at no-brainer prices, you can expect wall-friendly options.\n18V ONE 360-degree LED Light\nWith limited daylight in the fall, good lighting is in short supply. Ryobi's 360-degree light offers a solution. It uses Ryobi's 18V ONE+ rechargeable battery system so you don't need a permanent power source, and you won't have to buy a separate battery and charger if you've already got tools in the same system (just use what you have). The bright LED light gives you 360 degrees of coverage, which makes it a good companion for doing any type of work. You can control the level of brightness and choose whether to light one or all four lighting panels.\nUnlike other shop lights, the 360-degree light gives you different mounting options so you can put light wherever you need it. Use the top handle to point the light in any direction, or use the light hands-free with the attached hanging hook. A single charge will give you up to 15 hours of runtime. The light retails for $99.99, with the battery and charger sold separately.\nUSB Lithium Heated Seat Cushion\nRyobi's USB Lithium Heated Seat Cushion will keep you comfortable in cool weather. It's a cheaper alternative to heated car seats and can go with you pretty much anywhere. The 3-inch padding is comfortable to sit on for long periods of time. Three heat settings (low, medium, and high) let you control the temperature and can help you extend the cushion's battery life. Use it for long car rides, on the bleachers at sporting events, or anywhere you need a little extra warmth.\nThe cushion uses Ryobi's USB lithium battery, which you can charge again and again. A single charge will last up to five hours, depending on the temperature you choose. The power source also includes an LED indicator light so you can tell whether your batteries are fully charged or running low. As an added bonus, you can use the same power source to charge your phone or other mobile device. Take note: this is a new product and is listed as \"Coming Soon\" on Ryobi's website.\n18V ONE Storm Kit\nHurricane season isn't officially over until November, which means there's still a risk of storm-related damage, power outages, and other disruptions to your daily life. To help you get through the fall storm season, Ryobi offers its 18V ONE+ Storm Kit. This kit includes everything you need to keep your devices powered, your space illuminated, and your family informed in the event of a power outage or emergency.\nIncluded in the kit is Ryobi's Compact Radio, an LED Area Light, and a 150W Battery Power Source. The power source charges small devices (like your cell phone). As part of the 18V ONE+ family, you can use the same rechargeable batteries and chargers as other tools in this lineup. Each of the tools in the kit also includes a USB-A charging port so you can use them to keep your phones charged. The kit is available exclusively at The Home Depot and retails for $295, including one 2 Ah battery and charger.\n40V Vac Attack Leaf Vacuum and Mulcher Kit\nThe fall season means bright colors all around, but beautiful foliage quickly turns into cluttered yards. Ryobi's 40V Vac Attack Leaf Vacuum and Mulcher Kit gives you a cleaner yard in less time by turning fallen leaves into beneficial mulch. It's cordless so you can move it to all corners of your yard (and not worry about extension cords getting in the way of the blades). Just like a vacuum, you can maneuver the tool around easily to suck up the leaves, which are then shredded by a metal impeller and deposited into the attached bag.\nCompared to bagging leaves the old-fashioned way, you can turn 16 bags into just one bag with the Vac Attack system. You can also control the speed of the vacuum \u2014 using a high speed for large open yards or \"low and slow\" when working in flower beds or tighter areas. The vacuum is on wheels to save your arms and back. When you're done, you'll not only have a neat and tidy yard but also a bagful of mulch that's ready to spread. This is yet another Ryobi tool that will help deep clean you home (or at least, the outside of it). The Vac Attack system retails for $219 and includes the tool, a battery, and a charger.\n5-Ton 15 Amp Electric Log Splitter\nThe fall season means the return of outdoor fire pits, camping, and fires in the fireplace. Pre-cut firewood can be expensive, but you can save money when you cut your own. Ryobi makes a 5-ton 15 Amp Electric Log Splitter that makes cutting firewood easy. You can cut wood into perfect logs quickly and spare your back from hours of manual labor.\nThe log splitter has a push-button start and doesn't require any oil or gas mixing. Place your log on the support and get 5 tons of splitting force to quickly and precisely cut it into firewood. It can handle logs up to 20 inches long and up to 10 inches in diameter. When you're done, just roll the log splitter back to its storage place. The splitter is light enough for one person to transport and use, plus you can store it either horizontally or vertically depending on your space. The electric log splitter retails for $299.\n18V ONE Compact Camper's Kit\nIf you're planning a fall camping trip, the Ryobi 18V ONE+ Compact Camper's Kit is a must-have this fall. It gives you everything you need to stay cool and keep the party going after the sun goes down. And since it uses the 18V ONE+ rechargeable batteries, you can pair it with batteries from your other Ryobi devices for extra battery life.\nThe kit includes a compact LED area light, a compact speaker, and a clamp fan, along with a 1.5 Ah lithium battery and charger. The light offers three different settings and is small in size so you can easily pack it in a cooler, backpack, or other camping gear. The speaker can connect to your electronic devices via Bluetooth and has a connectivity reach of over 75 feet. And the clamp fan lets you put a breeze just about anywhere, clamping to anything from a tree branch to tent poles. The full kit is available from The Home Depot and retails for $194.\nUSB Lithium High Pressure Inflator Kit\nAnother addition to your complement of fall camping gadgets, the USB Lithium High Pressure Inflator Kit gives you air pressure wherever you need it. It's ideal for pumping up camping mattresses, stand-up paddle boards, mountain bike tires, and inflatable kayaks. And since it's cordless, you won't have to find a wired power source to use it.\nIf you have other USB Lithium battery products from Ryobi, you can use the same battery and charger for the inflator kit. The inflator tool includes a pressure gauge so you can see how much air you're putting into your belongings. It also has an onboard LED light so you can fix a flat in the dark. The full kit consists of the inflator, a USB Lithium rechargeable battery, USB cable for charging, a sports needle to inflate balls, and a valve adapter, with onboard storage for the accessories. The kit retails for $39.97. Or, you can upgrade to the 18V ONE+ high pressure digital inflator kit, one of Ryobi's new tools for 2024.\n18V ONE 150-Watt Battery Power Source and Charger Kit\nThe Ryobi 18V ONE+ 150-Watt Battery Power Source and Charger Kit lets you bring the fun with you, whether you're camping, tailgating, or sitting on the sidelines of your kids' sporting events. This portable power source uses the 18V ONE+ battery system and can power or charge multiple small devices at a time. You can charge your phone up to three times in just one charge. When you're done for the day, plug the power source and battery into a wall outlet to recharge the battery.\nYou can use the battery source to charge cell phones, tablets, fans, or anything else that uses a USB connection for charging. It's ideal for traveling, working remotely, power outages, or anywhere you need an extra charge. The 120-volt outlet gives you more ways to use this power source compared to other backup battery packs, such as bringing outdoor TVs, slow cookers, and air fryers on your tent camping trips. The unit includes 2 USB-A fast charging ports, a USB-C port, and a 120-volt AC outlet. You can get the power source and a rechargeable battery and charger for $99, or just the inverter for $79.\n18V ONE Dual Power LED Spotlight\nPortable yet powerful, Ryobi's 18V ONE+ Dual Power LED Spotlight gives you a light source that can reach up to 635 yards. In addition to using the 18V ONE+ battery system, it also includes a 12V automotive cord that runs off your car's power. It's a reliable option for camping, hunting, or roadside emergencies, especially with shorter days ahead. Similar in size and shape to a drill, the spotlight is comfortable and easy to hold, with a trigger-like button to light up your surroundings.\nThe Dual Power LED Spotlight has earned a 4.9 star rating across more than 416 reviews on the Ryobi website. Customers say they've used the spotlight to light up their entire home during power outages, act as a bike headlight, view wildlife at night in the woods or fields, and as an everyday (albeit super bright) flashlight. It's lightweight, cordless, and lasts several hours on a single charge. The spotlight retails for $59.97, with the battery and charger sold separately.\n14-Watt Foldable Solar Panel\nIf you like the idea of green energy, Ryobi's foldable solar panel is a great addition to your portable power collection. Solar power uses the sun's energy to fuel your devices on the go. This panel can charge small devices (Bluetooth speakers, power banks, cell phones, tablets, and so on) quickly via USB-A or USB-C port, and even restore power to your Ryobi 18V ONE+ batteries if you have the Ryobi inverter.\nWeighing just 1 pound, you can easily store the foldable panel in a hiking backpack, with other camping gear, or in your car's trunk. This way, you'll have it whenever you need to get some quick juice for your electronic devices. The folding mat includes seven attached loops around its perimeter so you can hang it at your preferred angle to charge or lay it flat on the ground or a table. The 14-watt portable solar panel retails for $79 and is sold exclusively at The Home Depot."
