Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways\n\nDoja Cat is putting her French lessons to use, as the Grammy-winning artist revealed the release date for her upcoming Vie album.\n\nDoja posted a trailer for the project on social media on Thursday (Aug. 14), which found her leaning into cosplaying a mademoiselle while speaking French (Vie translates to Live in English).\n\u2022 None Doja Cat Defends Her Position as a Rapper During Fan Debate: \u2018Please Stop Trying to Downplay My Ability\u2019\n\u2022 None 'The City Loves Him': Inside MGK's Emotional Homecoming, As Cleveland Celebrates MGK Day and His 'Lost Americana' Album\n\n\u201cJe sais que tu es ma vie Vie out 9/26,\u201d she captioned the cinematic clip, positioning her album for a Sept. 26 arrival.\n\nThe video finds Doja in various sophisticated outfits as she changes from Black lace to white fur and a sparkling diamond ballroom gown. One shot even finds Doja in couture in front of the Eiffel Tower during a recent trip to Paris.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201d she says while the camera pans to another version of herself. \u201cOf course I am,\u201d Doja replies while taking a bite of her croissant.\n\nFans were excited to hear a firm release date for the long-awaited album, which is Doja\u2019s first since 2023\u2019s Scarlet. \u201cAHH WE ARE SATTTTT,\u201d one person wrote. While another added: \u201cYesss Ms. Doja Jones!!!\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Doja Cat teased her upcoming \u201cJealous Type\u201d single, which will set the table for the album. The teaser came with a phone number for a Vie hotline, while callers were greeted by Doja playing the role of romance therapist. \u201cJealous Type\u201d is slated to be released on Aug. 21 at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nDoja Cat hasn\u2019t released any singles this year and has been tight-lipped about the project, but revealed in her V Magazine cover story in July that it\u2019s a \u201cpop-driven\u201d effort.\n\n\u201cI do want to be self-aware enough to admit the fact that this is a pop-driven project,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cI know that I can make pop music, and pop is just that it\u2019s popular. It starts to become a bit of a thing that\u2019s viewed as a sport by people who are just bystanders to it, who enjoy it, but maybe also don\u2019t respect it or what it is, which is just music \u2026 They see it as if this is some kind of football for girls and gays.\u201d\n\nWatch the trailer below and look for Vie on Sept. 26.\n\u2022 None Chart Rewind: In 1989, New Kids on the Block Were 'Hangin' Tough' at No. 1\n\u2022 None H.E.R. & Chris Brown 'Come Through' to No. 1 on Adult R&B Airplay Chart\n\nSign up for Billboard's Newsletter.

      "text": "Janet Jackson\u2019s Biggest Billboard Hot 100 Hits\nHere's a look at the pop icon's history on the chart.\nAs Janet Jackson celebrates her birthday (May 16), Billboard takes a look at the singer\u2019s history on the Billboard Hot 100.\nBorn as the youngest of 10 children to Joseph and Katherine Jackson, Janet was almost pre-destined to enter the music industry with her brothers and sisters. By her fifth birthday, five of her brothers \u2014 as The Jackson 5 \u2014 had already scored four Hot 100 No. 1 hits. Following in her family\u2019s musical footsteps, Janet made her Hot 100 debut in 1982 with \u201cYoung Love,\u201d at 16 years old. Though that single and her second career entry, 1984\u2019s \u201cCome Give Your Love to Me,\u201d both peaked outside the top 50, Jackson found her hit-making stride with 1986\u2019s Control. Among its many hits, she landed her first of 10 No. 1s on the chart with \u201cWhen I Think of You,\u201d which reigned for two weeks.\nThrough the next 15 years, Jackson remained a Hot 100 force: Her next four albums, Janet Jackson\u2019s Rhythm Nation 1814, janet., The Velvet Rope and All for You, each all generated at least one Hot 100 champ. Thanks to her decades of hits, Jackson is one of the most influential female artists to cross through the pop, R&B and dance genres, with 19 and 15 No. 1s on the Dance Club Songs and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts, respectively. She\u2019s also scored seven No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, between 1986 and 2015.\nJackson (who first broke through with TV roles on sitcoms Good Times and Diff\u2019rent Strokes) has won five Grammy Awards and has been nominated for both an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award. She was honored as the first-ever MTV Icon Award recipient in 2001 and received the MTV Video Vanguard Award in 1990.\nHere\u2019s a look at the superstar\u2019s top-performing hits on the Hot 100.\nJanet Jackson\u2019s Biggest Billboard Hot 100 Hits\n1. \u201cMiss You Much,\u201d peak position No. 1 (four weeks), peak date Oct. 7, 1989\n2. \u201cEscapade,\u201d No. 1 (three weeks), March 3, 1990\n3. \u201cThat\u2019s the Way Love Goes,\u201d No. 1 (eight weeks), May 15, 1993\n4. \u201cAll for You,\u201d No. 1 (seven weeks), April 14, 2001\n5. \u201cTogether Again,\u201d No. 1 (two weeks), Jan. 31, 1998\n6. \u201cLove Will Never Do (Without You),\u201d No. 1 (one week), Jan. 19, 1991\n7. \u201cWhen I Think of You,\u201d No. 1 (two weeks), Oct. 11, 1986\n8. \u201cAgain,\u201d No. 1 (two weeks) Dec. 11, 1993\n9. \u201cRunaway,\u201d No. 3, Oct. 21, 1995\n10. \u201cDoesn\u2019t Really Matter,\u201d No. 1 (three weeks), Aug. 26, 2000\n11. \u201cRhythm Nation,\u201d No. 2, Jan. 6, 1990\n12. \u201cAlright,\u201d No. 4, June 2, 1990\n13. \u201cControl,\u201d No. 5, Jan. 24, 1987\n14. \u201cWhat Have You Done for Me Lately,\u201d No. 4, May 17, 1986\n15. \u201cBlack Cat,\u201d No. 1 (one week), Oct. 27, 1990\n16. \u201cNasty,\u201d No. 3, July 19, 1986\n17. \u201cLet\u2019s Wait Awhile,\u201d No. 2, March 21, 1987\n18. \u201cCome Back to Me,\u201d No. 2, Aug. 18, 1990\n19. \u201cAny Time, Any Place\u201d/\u201dAnd On and On,\u201d No. 2, June 25, 1994\n20. \u201cIf,\u201d No. 4, Sept. 11, 1993\n21. \u201cWhat\u2019s It Gonna Be?!,\u201d (Busta Rhymes featuring Janet Jackson) No. 3, April 17, 1999\n22. \u201cSomeone to Call My Lover,\u201d No. 3, Sept. 1, 2001\n23. \u201cYou Want This\u201d/\u201c70\u2019s Love Groove,\u201d No. 8, Dec. 24, 1994\n24. \u201cI Get Lonely\u201d (Janet featuring BLACKstreet), No. 3, May 23, 1998\n25. \u201cScream\u201d/\u201cChildhood\u201d (with Michael Jackson), No. 5, June 17, 1995\nJanet Jackson\u2018s Biggest Billboard Hot 100 hits chart is based on actual performance on the weekly Billboard Hot 100, through the May 20, 2023, ranking.

      "text": "Chart Rewind: In 1989, New Kids on the Block Were \u2018Hangin\u2019 Tough\u2019 at No. 1\nThe Boston boy band topped the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 with its breakthrough album and the set's title cut, respectively.\nIn every era of pop music, boy bands have elicited irrepressible shrieks from adoring fans. In the \u201960s, it was the Beatles. In the \u201970s, the Jackson 5. More recently, the likes of Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, who then passed the boy band baton to One Direction and 5 Seconds of Summer.\nIn 1989, it was New Kids on the Block\u2018s turn to rule music like only boy bands can.\nAfter Boston-based producer-songwriter Maurice Starr had formed New Edition, which reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1985 with \u201cCool It Now,\u201d he followed with New Kids on the Block \u2013 brothers Jonathan and Jordan Knight, Joey McIntyre, Donnie Wahlberg and Danny Wood. While their self-titled first LP didn\u2019t hit the Billboard 200 upon its release, follow-up Hangin\u2019 Tough filled the late-\u201980s boy band void, yielding five infectious Hot 100 top 10s, including the quintet\u2019s first No. 1 in June 1989, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Loving You (Forever).\u201d The ballad followed the No. 10-peaking \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Go Girl\u201d and the No. 3 hit \u201cYou Got It (The Right Stuff),\u201d which built even more buzz.\nOn Sept. 9, 1989, New Kids\u2019 rise culminated in the set and its title track taking over atop the Billboard 200 and Hot 100, respectively. The set was a slow-burner that took 55 weeks to reach the Billboard 200 summit, completing one of the longest climbs to No. 1 in the chart\u2019s history.\nBy years\u2019 end, New Kids on the Block had charted at last on the Billboard 200, reaching No. 25, and generated its own top 10, the group\u2019s No. 8 cover of the Delfonics\u2019 \u201cDidn\u2019t I (Blow Your Mind).\u201d The group even gleaned a top 10 from a third album, the holiday set Merry, Merry Christmas, when \u201cThis One\u2019s for the Children\u201d reached No. 7. In between, Hangin\u2019 Tough\u2018s fifth single \u201cCover Girl\u201d rose to No. 2.\n(On their summer 1989 tour, New Kids on the Block \u2013 and former Billboard publisher Tommy Page, then in his teen-idol days [he passed in 2017] \u2013 set out as the opening acts for Tiffany. By the end of the tour, Tiffany and New Kids had swapped spots.)\nThe Kids\u2019 blend of street (i.e., Wahlberg\u2019s semi-rap on \u201cHangin\u2019 Tough\u201d) and sweet (Jordan Knight and McIntyre served as the voices of the band\u2019s biggest ballads) helped make them a chart, touring and merchandise powerhouse, one that continued with 1990\u2019s Step by Step. Like its predecessor, the album and its title song became respective Billboard 200 and Hot 100 No. 1s. Follow-up single \u201cTonight,\u201d which playfully name-checks several of the act\u2019s earlier hits, rose to No. 7.\nUltimately, the group earned the honor of Billboard\u2018s top artist of both 1989 and 1990.\nAs musical trends shifted from pure-pop to rap and grunge, New Kids on the Block released the No. 37-peaking Face the Music (billed as NKOTB) in 1994 before taking a hiatus. With enough time passed for nostalgia to help restore its image (along with a return to prominence for pop music), the band blew back in 2008 with the No. 2 hit album The Block (featuring a track with then-new act Lady Gaga), which yielded the quintet\u2019s first top 40 Hot 100 hit since 1992, the No. 36-peaking \u201cSummertime.\u201d Its 2013 album 10 hit No. 6. In between, the act embraced its place in boy band lineage: In 2011, it released NKOTBSB, a collaborative set with Backstreet Boys, which hit No. 7. The acts\u2019 partnership continued in the form of Nick & Knight, aka BSB\u2019s Nick Carter and New Kid Jordan, in 2014.\nMost recently, New Kids on the Block released the album Still Kids, which launched at No. 4 on the Top Album Sales chart in June. Lead single \u201cKids\u201d has hit both the Adult Pop Airplay and Adult Contemporary charts, marking the group\u2019s first appearance on the latter list in nearly 35 years.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of not wanting to let each other down,\u201d Wahlberg said when the group chatted with Billboard in New York in May. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgency that I think you can sometimes hear in the voices, of wanting to deliver the best of a performance. I think that\u2019s present in this record, even in the writing.\u201d"
