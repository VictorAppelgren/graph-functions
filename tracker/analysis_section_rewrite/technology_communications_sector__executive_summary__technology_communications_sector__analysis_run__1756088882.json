      "feedback": "The draft has a coherent regime-based thesis but needs a sharper, 4–6 sentence house view and explicit, observable triggers to reach world-class, decision-useful standard; tighten the causal chain to: liquidity from private credit (~$50B/q) and CMBS (+30% to $15.6B) funds long-dated AI infra capex, which supports long‑dated debt service and then informs pricing via credit spreads/assets (OBQMETU6O; S94YUAWG8); treat OpenAI’s trillion-dollar spend vs MIT profitability concerns as a single, long-horizon risk anchor rather than scattered prompts, ensuring sources align (OBQMETU6O); split the analysis into Base Case, Bear Case, and Invalidation with explicit, observable triggers rather than narrative breadth; relocate the Apple-centric discussion to a dedicated 3–6 month sub-section anchored by A85HNI04L (Gemini integration milestones, App Intents readiness) with clear invalidation if Gemini talks falter or rollout slows; separate near-term stock signals (NXPI/ON) as corroborative but not core drivers, cited to S94YUAWG8; tighten the watch-list to only the numbers that sources provide (private credit inflows, CMBS AI exposure, 6% PIK debt, 20–30 year tenors, and Gemini/App Intents milestones) and reconcile any contradictory signals across OBQMETU6O, S94YUAWG8, and A85HNI04L; remove repetition and filler, ensure alignment with SECTION FOCUS by delivering a concise, decision-ready brief, and ensure the final version remains within 4–6 sentences/points.",
