  "title": "Nvidia to Sell B30A to China: More Capable Than H20, But Half the Power of B300",
  "description": "This is after the US announced that it would allow the sale of more advanced technology to China, so long as the US gets a 15% cut of the proceeds.",
  "content": "Nvidia is developing a new cut-down version of its Blackwell Ultra B300 flagship AI platform for sale in the Chinese market, according to Reuters' sources. Although the B30A will be far faster than existing H20 platforms that are sold to China, it will still be around half the performance of the B300.\n\nThe sale of AI training and inference hardware from the US to China has been a major point of contention in the ongoing trade tariff war between the two nations and an example of the global drive towards semiconductor and AI self-sufficiency. However, news recently broke that Trump had approved the sale of more advanced hardware, but with an additional 15% tax on the profits companies like Nvidia and AMD made doing so.\n\nThe new Nvidia CPU would come under that tax, though it would likely be incredibly profitable anyway. Although China is looking to source more of its data center hardware from domestic sources, there's still no beating Nvidia's top chips for raw compute power. The B30A, although a far cry from what American data centers could run with the B300, would still be a considerable upgrade over what is currently available and many generations ahead of any Chinese-developed counterparts.\n\nThe B30A will reportedly use a single-die design rather than the dual-chip layout of the B300, thereby cutting performance in half at least. The final specifications for the B30A have yet to be finalized, so Nvidia may make additional tweaks to improve or curtail performance using clock speeds or adjusting available core counts, depending on the business and political environment at the time of their release.\n\nThat is a consideration that all major chip developers, and particularly chip exporters, need to consider under the current US administration. With tariffs changing at arbitrary times to arbitrary rates, as well as the potential for entire export blocks and additional taxes, it's a turbulent time to be selling high-end silicon. However, the demand is enormous, so even with these concerns, Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and other companies are all well placed to make incredible profits in the years to come.",

The new chip will fall under a 15% tax on profits from sales to China, yet remains highly profitable. China\u2019s push for domestic data\u2011center hardware cannot yet match Nvidia\u2019s compute power, and the B30A\u2019s single\u2011die design may allow Nvidia to adjust performance through clock speeds or core counts.
