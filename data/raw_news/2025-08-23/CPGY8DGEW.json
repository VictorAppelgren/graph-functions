  "content": "The Football Championship Subdivision opening kickoff game between UC Davis and Mercer ended in a rare no contest, after torrential rain and unending lightning sent the game into a delay late in the fourth quarter. With no end in sight in the forecast, the remainder of the game was called off.\n\nNo. 7 UC Davis was leading No. 11 Mercer 23-17 with 7:46 left and Mercer possessing the ball at midfield. The neutral-site game took place in Montgomery, Ala., and the game\u2019s statistics were voided.\n\nMercer trailed 23-3 in the third quarter, before rallying to pull within six points in the fourth.\n\nCanceling ongoing college football games due to weather is rare. Last year, a Division II game between Clark Atlanta and Florida Memorial ended in a tie at halftime due to weather. That went in the record books as an even rarer tie.",
