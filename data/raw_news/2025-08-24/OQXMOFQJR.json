  "title": "Following Trump\u2019s lead, Netanyahu shifts strategy on ceasefire even after Hamas accepts",
  "description": "After 18 months of agreeing only to partial, phased ceasefire deals, Netanyahu is now demanding a comprehensive agreement that would secure the release of all hostages and end the war entirely \u2013 on Israel\u2019s terms.",
  "content": "Nearly a week after Hamas accepted the latest Gaza ceasefire proposal from Qatari and Egyptian mediators, Israel has yet to respond - even as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims he is \u201cimmediately\u201d starting negotiations to release all the hostages and end the war.\n\nThe silence reflects a fundamental shift in Israel\u2019s approach that has befuddled mediators and families of the remaining hostages, who have accused Netanyahu of abandoning and sacrificing their loved ones.\n\nAfter 18 months of agreeing only to partial, phased ceasefire deals, Netanyahu is now demanding a comprehensive agreement that would secure the release of all hostages and end the war entirely \u2013 on Israel\u2019s terms. The policy reversal comes as the prime minister simultaneously accelerates plans for a massive military assault on Gaza City, pursuing a dual strategy of negotiating while waging war to \u201cdefeat Hamas.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Netanyahu declared that he had instructed his team to immediately start negotiations for the return of all the hostages and end the war in Gaza. But he did so without once mentioning the proposal currently on the table \u2013 which calls for a temporary ceasefire in exchange for the release of half of the hostages. The latest proposal is similar to the 60-day ceasefire Netanyahu agreed to last month, only with terms more favorable to Israel after Hamas showed flexibility on the number of prisoners to be released and the size of the security perimeter.\n\nAt the same time, Netanyahu made a point of continuing to advance plans for the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 (IDF) massive assault and takeover of Gaza City. Israel attributes Hamas\u2019 concessions to the threat of its imminent Gaza City offensive, and Israeli officials say they believe the renewed threat of heavy military pressure will make Hamas more flexible to accept Israel\u2019s conditions to end the war.\n\nIsrael has long claimed that military pressure will force Hamas to the table, but the terror group, while depleted, has defied defeat despite nearly two years of fighting.\n\nNetanyahu has not explained what caused this dramatic shift from a partial to a comprehensive negotiation framework, and his mixed messaging has left many in Israel and abroad confused: for a year and a half the government refused to discuss ending the war and only agreed to negotiate phased and partial ceasefire agreements. Now he\u2019s opting only for a comprehensive deal and has been reluctant to respond to the mediators\u2019 latest proposal that was accepted by Hamas,\n\nBasem Naim, a senior member of Hamas\u2019 political bureau, said in a statement, \u201cThe movement has presented everything necessary to reach a ceasefire agreement and is still ready to do so with all national responsibility and an open mind.\u201d Naim said that Netanyahu has a \u201cgreen light\u201d from the Trump administration to continue what he called a \u201cdirty game.\u201d\n\nAccording to senior Israeli sources, the answer in Netanyahu\u2019s new negotiations strategy lies not in Jerusalem but in Washington. In recent weeks, US President Donald Trump has expressed explicit public support for Israel\u2019s renewed assault in Gaza, adopting the Israeli rhetoric aiming to destroy Hamas, instead of pushing for a temporary ceasefire.\n\n\u201cWe will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!! The sooner this takes place, the better the chances of success will be,\u201d President Trump wrote on his Truth Social media platform last week.\n\nAccording to one senior Israeli source, after Hamas raised obstacles during the last round of negotiations in Qatar in July, Trump \u201clost patience and trust with the partial process and doesn\u2019t believe Hamas actually wants a deal.\u201d\n\nThis echoes remarks his envoy Steve Witkoff made after the latest round of talks collapsed, slamming Hamas as uncoordinated and not acting in good faith and saying the US would explore alternative options to secure hostage release and stabilize Gaza.\n\n\u201cIt was too bad. Hamas didn\u2019t really want to make a deal. I think they want to die,\u201d Trump told reporters outside the White House at the time. Shortly after the comments, Netanyahu\u2019s office shifted to an \u201call or nothing\u201d approach, demanding a comprehensive deal.\n\nIn the latest Israeli security cabinet meeting, during which Netanyahu\u2019s government approved the decision to expand and deepen the operation in Gaza City, five conditions were set to end the war: disarmament of Hamas, the release of all the hostages, demilitarization of Gaza while maintaining Israeli security control, and the establishment of an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority.\n\nBut Hamas has drawn a red line at any notion of disarming. Israeli analysts say Netanyahu\u2019s double-messaging \u2013 pursuing war and peace \u2013 is a political tactic to buy time. It prolongs the war and his own rule.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu is fully aware that Hamas will never accept his conditions for ending the war \u2013 and that is precisely his point,\u201d Chaim Levinson, a senior diplomatic commentator for Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper, told CNN. Netanyahu\u2019s demand for territorial control over large swaths of Gaza \u201cis likely to derail any potential agreement.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu has demanded full Israeli security control over Gaza in any post-war scenario, a scenario in which Israel would retain the right to carry out strikes in Gaza. \u201cUnder such conditions, no one will invest in Gaza, since the territory would remain trapped in a state of ongoing conflict,\u201d Levinson said.\n\nWhile repeated polling has shown that the vast majority of the Israeli public would support any deal that would bring back the hostages - Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition partners, Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, adamantly oppose any ceasefire or end to the war, and have warned more than once that it could lead to the collapse of his government.\n\nBecause of that overt threat, all of the hostage deals so far were designed as phased and gradual, according to an Israeli source with knowledge of the negotiations. The partial approach enabled Netanyahu to promise his coalition partners that Israel will resume the war eventually.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s far-right allies have pressed the Israeli leader to expand the war and ramp up the bombardment of the devastated enclave until Hamas surrenders.\n\nFormer State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the Biden administration believed Netanyahu was throwing up roadblocks to a ceasefire deal. \u201cThere were times that we very much wanted to go public and make clear that we thought the prime minister was being completely intransigent and making it tougher to get a deal,\u201d he told Israel\u2019s Channel 13. But the administration kept the disagreements private, Miller said, because former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar pulled back from negotiations when he saw a split between the US and Israel.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s latest maneuvering and perceived double messaging has escalated tensions between his government and the families of the remaining hostages in Gaza. The families, who have been ramping up public pressure since the cabinet approved the Gaza City offensive, accused the government of sacrificing the hostages by delaying or dismissing the partial agreement on the table.\n\nAfter launching some of the largest anti-war protests Israel has seen since the beginning of the conflict nearly two years ago, the hostage families are scheduling another protest for Tuesday night, trying to keep the pressure on a government they feel is deaf to their cries of pain.\n\nEinav Zangauker, the mother of Matan, who is held hostage in Gaza, blamed Netanyahu for torpedoing the negotiations. \u201cYou are setting unattainable conditions to end the war, preparing the army to conquer Gaza, you will lead soldiers into death traps,\u201d she said at a demonstration on Friday night outside the prime minister\u2019s residence. \u201cYou will sentence Matan to death, you will cause the deceased hostages to disappear forever!\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to brush off public criticism, Netanyahu\u2019s office briefed Israeli reporters over the weekend that he will be sending a negotiation team as soon as a location is set for the talks.\n\nBut without a site selected for the next attempt at ceasefire negotiations \u2013 and with the US team tied up with Ukraine and Russia \u2013 Netanyahu can pursue his dual strategy: making statements about ending the war while taking military action that escalates it.",

  "summary": "Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has changed his approach on a Gaza ceasefire proposal, despite Hamas accepting it. Despite announcing that he is starting negotiations for the release of all hostages and ending the war, Netanyahu has now demanded a comprehensive agreement that would secure the release and end the conflict entirely on Israel's terms. This shift in Israel's approach has baffled mediators and families of the remaining hostages, who accuse Netanyahu of abandoning them. The change comes as Israel increases plans for a massive military assault on Gaza City.

      "text": "Hamas says it has agreed to a new Gaza ceasefire proposal as mediators from Qatar and Egypt push to renew talks ahead of a major Israeli assault on Gaza City.\nIn a statement, Hamas said it had accepted the new proposal presented on Sunday by Qatar and Egypt.\nBasem Naim, a senior member of Hamas\u2019 political bureau, said on social media, \u201cThe movement has accepted the new proposal from the mediators. We pray that God extinguishes the fires of this war on our people.\u201d\nTwo Israeli officials told CNN that Israel had received the Hamas response from mediators. One of the Israeli officials said that the government\u2019s position had not changed, which includes calling for the release of all the hostages, the disarmament of Hamas, and Israeli security control of the besieged territory.\nThe proposal marks a renewed effort from mediators to restart negotiations that fell apart in July, extinguishing what had been the best hopes to stop the fighting in months. It also dashed chances of an imminent end to the war, and Israel\u2019s security cabinet recently voted to escalate the conflict and occupy Gaza City.\nThe newly approved operation increased pressure on mediators to renew talks and secure a deal in an attempt to avert an even worse humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.\nThe new proposal adheres closely to the last ceasefire plan discussed before negotiations fell apart last month.\nA senior Hamas official told CNN the proposal calls for the release of 10 living hostages and 18 deceased hostages. The hostages will be released in exchange for 140 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 60 serving sentences of more than 15 years. Israel will also release all Palestinian minors and female prisoners, the official said.\nAccording to a diplomat briefed on the negotiations, Qatari and Egyptian mediators secured a breakthrough that preserves 98% of the last proposal from US envoy Steve Witkoff, to which Israel had previously agreed. The mediators put pressure on Hamas to accept the proposal.\nThe proposal entails a ceasefire during which Israeli forces redeploy to the lines specified in the Witkoff proposal, while humanitarian aid flows intensively to meet the basic needs of the population in Gaza.\nThis step opens the way to reaching a comprehensive agreement in the best possible manner without endangering the lives of the hostages through further intense military operations and avoiding a worsening of the humanitarian situation for the people of Gaza, who are already suffering greatly, the diplomat said. It also marks the beginning of the road to a comprehensive solution, the diplomat added.\nA regional source involved in the Gaza talks told CNN that Hamas \u201cinsists\u201d on \u201cwritten American guarantees\u201d for a ceasefire \u201cafter 60 days.\u201d Hamas wants the US to ensure that Israel does not return to war, the source told CNN. The most recent ceasefire negotiations, which fell apart in July, focused on a 60-day ceasefire and the release of approximately half of the remaining 50 hostages.\nA second diplomat involved in the negotiations said, \u201cGiven the developments, Egypt and Qatar will extend an invitation to Steve Witkoff to come to Cairo.\u201d\nQatari Prime Minister and minister of foreign affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani arrived in Egypt for discussions about ceasefire negotiations, Egyptian officials said Monday. Qatari officials met with Witkoff last weekend in Spain.\nHardening positions\nPrior to talks collapsing in July, the most difficult issues in the negotiations included the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for the hostages, the size of the Israeli buffer zone around Gaza, and the scope of the Israeli withdrawal during the ceasefire.\nHamas also demanded a comprehensive end to the war, which Israel has refused.\nThe US and Israel indicated they would harden their positions, only accepting a comprehensive deal instead of a partial agreement, when the last round of negotiations failed.\nOn Monday, US President Donald Trump said on social media, \u201cWe will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!! The sooner this takes place, the better the chances of success will be.\u201d\nIsrael\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday evening, \u201cLike you, I hear the reports in the media \u2013 and from them, one thing is clear: Hamas is under immense pressure.\u201d\nHe did not say whether he would consider a new proposal after insisting that Israel would only agree to a comprehensive deal that achieved his maximalist positions. He has said that any agreement needs to include the disarmament of Hamas, which has been a red line for the militant organization.\nThis fresh proposal comes after hundreds of thousands of Israelis demonstrated in Tel Aviv and across the country on Sunday, demanding that Israel agree to a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages and end the war. In a series of events that lasted all day, protesters blocked major intersections across the country, carried out a grassroots strike, and held a massive rally in Hostages Square.\nNetanyahu\u2019s far-right allies, who have demanded an escalation of the war, warned the Israeli premier about accepting a ceasefire deal.\nMinister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir said in a recorded video: \u201cMr. Prime Minister, I\u2019ll make this short and simple: you do not have a mandate to go for a partial deal. The blood of our soldiers is not to be disregarded. We must go all the way \u2014 to destroy Hamas.\u201d Ben Gvir quit the government over the last ceasefire in January before rejoining when Israel resumed the war two months later.\nBut opposition politicians immediately threw their weight behind Netanyahu and behind the latest ceasefire effort.\nFormer Defense Minister Benny Gantz, who chairs the Blue and White Party, said in a statement, \u201cThe government has a clear majority and a broad safety net to bring the hostages home. Netanyahu, this is not a time to hesitate \u2014 this is a time to make the right decisions for the people of Israel and the security of Israel.\u201d\nThere have been two ceasefires and hostage-release deals in Gaza since Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks.\nIn November 2023, a weeklong ceasefire saw 105 hostages freed from Gaza and around 240 Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli prisons before it collapsed.\nA second ceasefire was not struck until January 2025. In just over 8 weeks \u2013 the first \u201cphase\u201d of the ceasefire \u2013 Hamas freed 33 hostages, with Israel releasing around 50 Palestinian prisoners for every Israeli freed.\nUnder the planned second stage, Israel was supposed to agree to a permanent ceasefire. But Israel resumed its offensive on March 18, shattering the truce and derailing the talks, saying it did so to put pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages.\nThis is a developing story and will be updated."

      "text": "Hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered around Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on Sunday night, with organizers reporting a turnout exceeding 400,000.\nIn one of the largest coordinated demonstrations since the beginning of the Gaza war nearly two years ago, protesters blocked major roads, closed private businesses, and staged rallies in big cities across Israel.\nThe nationwide grassroots strike and widespread protests grew over the course of Sunday as protesters demand the government secure the release of 50 hostages still in Gaza. People also protested outside government ministers\u2019 homes.\nThe day of protests began at 06:29 a.m., the exact time when Hamas launched its deadly attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Organizers said that throughout the day, over one million people participated in hundreds of actions held across the country.\nAt the start of the main rally at Hostages Square, a new video clip of the captive Matan Zangauker was released. The video, said to be recorded several months ago in Gaza, was recently obtained by the Israeli military during its operations and was released by Einav Zangauker, Matan\u2019s mother, as part of the intensifying campaign to free the hostages.\nIn the video, Zangauker appears with a shaved head and addresses his sisters and his partner, who was kidnapped with him from Kibbutz Nir Oz and was released after 50 days in November 2023. In the video, Zangauker appears, saying: \u201cTatu (Natali), Shani, Ilana \u2013 I miss you, and God willing, we\u2019ll meet soon. To all my acquaintances, all my friends \u2013 go out and make noise like only you know how.\u201d\nAfter the video was released, Einav Zangauker spoke at the Hostages\u2019 Square and said: \u201cYour quiet gaze at the end of the video accompanies me as I toss and turn in bed at night. My soul burns with longing; it burns that I cannot hug you, hear you, and hold you.\u201d\nIn her speech, Zangauker criticized the government\u2019s conduct.\n\u201cThey have turned the most just war into a futile war. If Netanyahu wants an agreement, let him put a comprehensive proposal on the table and agree to it; otherwise, he is simply lying,\u201d Zangauker added.\nFamily members of the hostages, leading the strike alongside the October Council, which represents bereaved families from the war, held a press conference in Tel Aviv, announcing an \u201cemergency break\u201d until the hostages are released.\n\u201cToday, we stop everything to save the lives of 50 hostages and soldiers. Today, we stop everything to remember the supreme value of the sanctity of life,\u201d said Anat Engrest, whose son Matan is held in Gaza.\nPolls have repeatedly shown a large majority in Israel support a ceasefire deal to release all of the hostages in exchange for an end to the war. The last round of negotiations fell apart in late-July, when the US and Israel withdrew their teams from talks in Doha, accusing Hamas of not negotiating in good faith.\n\u201cWe are united in one simple demand directed at the Israeli government: Put an Israeli proposal on the table today for a comprehensive deal \u2013 to end the war in exchange for the return of the last hostage. No slogans, no sabotage, no demands that we know the other side won\u2019t accept,\u201d said Vicky Cohen, whose son Nimrod is a hostage. \u201cIt\u2019s time to end the horrific nightmare the entire country has been living in for 22 months.\u201d\nThe strike was announced last week, following the Israeli security cabinet\u2019s decision to expand the war and take over Gaza City, despite the Israeli military\u2019s warning that the operations could endanger the 50 remaining hostages in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to still be alive.\nThe Israeli military says the operation will begin \u201csoon\u201d and the government says it will provide the local population in Gaza with tents before relocating them \u201cfor their protection.\u201d Almost the entire population in Gaza has been displaced, with many forced to move multiple times.\nAs of early Sunday afternoon, Israeli police say 38 protesters had been arrested across the country for disturbing the peace.\nIsrael\u2019s largest labor organization, the Histadrut, did not join the strike, though it encouraged employers to let workers participate. But many technology companies, law firms, academic institutions and private sector enterprises announced their participation and support, alongside citizens who declared they would take the day off or refrain from business transactions.\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog expressed support for the hostage families, while visiting the central gathering at Hostages Square. \u201cAll of the people of Israel are anxious, concerned, and want the hostages to come home. There is not a single Israeli woman or man who does not want them home,\u201d Herzog said.\nBut members of the Israeli government slammed the day of protests.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting: \u201cThose who are calling today to end the war without defeating Hamas not only harden Hamas\u2019s stance and delay the release of our hostages \u2013 they are also ensuring that the horrors of October 7 will repeat themselves again and again.\u201d\nItamar Ben Gvir, the far-right Minister of National Security, said the strike was a \u201ccynical political maneuver on the backs of the hostages,\u201d linking it to long-standing anti-government protest movement.\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents most of the hostages who remain in Gaza, said in response: \u201cYou can continue to hide behind spins and political calculations, but you cannot escape responsibility.\u201d\nThe Forum announced plans to set up a protest encampment on the Gaza border called \u201cWaypoint 50\u201d \u2013 representing the 50 hostages \u2013 to continue pressuring the government to secure their release."

      "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has ordered negotiations for the release of all hostages and an end to the war in Gaza \u201con terms acceptable to Israel.\u201d\nThe Israel military still intends to advance plans to take control of Gaza City, Netanyahu said.\nThe Israeli leader\u2019s remarks came in a video recorded on Thursday, ahead of a high-level security meeting Netanyahu convened with defense chiefs and cabinet ministers focused on approving the operational plans to take Gaza City and \u201cdecisively defeat Hamas.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the Israeli military is already on the outskirts of Gaza City, and local residents told CNN on Friday that the city was under under shelling all night. Multiple casualties have been reported, including several children killed in a strike on a school.\nNetanyahu stressed that Israel is now at a critical juncture.\n\u201cWe are at the decisive stage,\u201d he said, underlining that \u201cdefeating Hamas and securing the release of all hostages go hand in hand.\u201d\nThis is the first time Netanyahu has publicly addressed the Gaza war ceasefire talks since Hamas responded positively earlier this week to the latest proposal put forth by mediators from Qatar and Egypt.\nStill, the Israeli prime minister did not say to whom he had given the order to start immediate negotiations and avoided referring to the current proposal framework, which begins with a 60-day ceasefire during which half of the remaining Israeli hostages are to be released.\nIsraeli officials believe that 50 hostages remain in Gaza, at least 20 of whom are thought to be alive.\nIn his recent public statements and official briefings, Netanyahu has emphasized that Israel is seeking a comprehensive agreement that would secure the release of all hostages and meet Israel\u2019s conditions for ending the war.\nHe continues to push forward plans for a massive assault on Gaza City, and on Wednesday instructed the military to shorten the timeline of the operation \u2013 despite concern from residents of Gaza City, who have described Israel\u2019s plans as the \u201cbeginning of a new war.\u201d\nThe humanitarian situation in the city \u2013 the largest in northern Gaza \u2013 is already dire.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a UN-backed program, said on Friday that famine has been confirmed in the Gaza Governorate, which includes Gaza City.\nMeanwhile, deadly strikes continue on daily basis. At least 18 Palestinians, including several children, have been killed in a series of Israeli strikes against a school in the city on Friday morning, according to Fares Afana, who heads the emergency services in northern Gaza.\nHe told CNN that the Omar Ibn Al-A\u2019as school, which has been used as a shelter for displaced people, was targeted by artillery fire.\n\u201cThe school yard was packed with tents and residents, many of which are women and children,\u201d Afana told CNN.\nIsrael has called up tens of thousands of reservists to take part in the impending military operation.\n\u201cWe are at the stage of decision,\u201d Netanyahu said in a video address. \u201cToday I came to the Gaza Division to approve the plans that the (Israel Defense Forces) presented to me and to the minister of defense for taking control of Gaza City and defeating Hamas.\u201d\nAt the same time, Netanyahu refrained from making any official reference to the mediators\u2019 proposal, leaving open the possibility of a partial agreement.\nTwo Israeli sources say that Netanyahu is managing the developments under tight secrecy and confidentiality.\nCNN\u2019s Ibrahim Dahman and Kareem Khadder contributed reporting."

      "text": "Two years ago, Gaza\u2019s largest city was sprawling with life. Classrooms brimmed with schoolchildren, markets were full of shoppers and beachside cafes offered respite for those escaping the stresses of a besieged enclave.\nGaza City boasts a rich history, inhabited for thousands of years and shaped by successive takeovers from ancient civilizations. It served as a key landing point for Palestinians displaced during Israel\u2019s founding in 1948 and has hundreds of millennia-old sites documenting its past.\nIt was therefore no surprise that Islamist militant group Hamas chose Gaza City as its de facto capital when it seized control of the strip in 2007.\nYears of conflict, a crippling blockade and Hamas\u2019 autocratic rule made life for Palestinians hard. But the institutions set up by the militants, with help from regional governments like Qatar and a robust United Nations aid system, gave some structure to the strip\u2019s exhausted population.\nAn established underground smuggling system gave Gaza City a taste of the outside world amid the land, air and sea siege imposed by neighbors Israel and Egypt \u2013 who both designate Hamas a terror organization. While life was far from easy in Gaza City, with half the population unemployed and Hamas\u2019 police strictly patrolling the streets, you could still get a matcha latte on the way to a yoga studio, or relax in a park.\nToday, what was once the cultural and financial hub of the enclave, lies in lawless ruins, devastated by months of a brutal Israeli assault triggered by Hamas\u2019 deadly attack on Israel almost two years ago. And as Israel\u2019s plans to launch a new offensive on the densely populated area to eliminate Hamas militants hiding underground, Palestinians of the Gaza historic city reckon, once again, with mounting fears of survival.\nLife in Gaza City\nNormal life in the coastal enclave collapsed after Israel\u2019s brutal retaliation to Hamas\u2019 attack.\nHundreds of thousands sheltering in shattered buildings of the city have been left to fend for themselves after the fall of Hamas\u2019 policing apparatus. Unclear about their future, residents of Gaza City listen for news of the next food shipment, or the sudden sound of a trickle of salty water from bathroom pipes \u2013 which would give them a rare chance for a shower.\nIsrael does not allow journalists into Gaza. CNN spoke to several of Gaza City\u2019s residents to paint a picture of how the city looks amidst the war.\nTens of thousands of Israeli strikes have left the city\u2019s many towers lying in rubble as garbage and sewage water flood the streets. Black smoke from burning plastic and wood, used by residents for fuel, fill the skies and the sounds of overhead Israeli drones buzz non-stop amid sporadic blasts from airstrikes nearby.\nA chaotic web of wires from street generators supply power to those who can afford to pay. Markets display a random assortment of exorbitantly priced food items, possibly looted by criminal gangs from the few aid trucks Israel allows into the strip.\nHospitals and pharmacies no longer function, and hygiene products remain a scarcity for Palestinians, who say infestations of lice, a lack of vitamins, with no food have left them ill and weak.\nAs night falls, armed thugs roam the streets and families pick up guns to protect themselves. Cash can be transferred to Gaza through an informal banking system \u2013 but those seeking to withdraw it are forced to pay up to 50% in commission to individuals and groups controlling the money supply.\nDogs \u2018eating so many bodies\u2019\nMajdi Abu Hamdi, 40, a father of four, said dust from the explosions chokes the streets and seeps into the homes that are still standing, where blown-out windows make it hard to breathe.\nEven stray dogs have changed their behaviour, he told CNN. \u201cAt night, we hear dogs howling. They have turned wild from eating so many bodies. Their barking has changed, becoming fierce.\u201d\n\u201cThey are even dangerous to people, attacking residents savagely. Two days ago, by mistake, a cat walked near them. More than twenty dogs attacked and tore it apart,\u201d he said.\nHe continued, \u201cPeople may be thirty years old, but the exhaustion of war makes them look seventy. Hunger and poor food wear them down. We only use the bathroom every three days because of lack of food and high prices.\u201d\nHamas, once so visible on the streets of Gaza City, is now absent. Its political offices, organizational municipalities and police stations are destroyed, and its militants stay hidden.\n\u201cThe sons of bitches have no control, it\u2019s not like old times\u2026 but sometimes you find them appearing suddenly, you don\u2019t know where from,\u201d said Abu Mohamed, a resident of Gaza City who opposes Hamas.\nThe resident, who didn\u2019t provide his full name out of fear of Hamas\u2019 retaliation, said the group has no forces visibly present, and civilians do not know how the group organizes itself.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have specific places where they gather. They have their own special ways on how they communicate or how they organize\u2026 we don\u2019t know how they do that,\u201d Abu Mohamed said of Hamas.\nBashar Taleb, a journalist in Gaza City, questioned the purpose of Hamas\u2019s weapons if they fail to protect Palestinians.\n\u201cWhat is the use of the weaponry if it has not protected a single civilian, and has not prevented the hunger and the continuous death that has lasted for nearly seven hundred days among innocent civilians who have no power in this war,\u201d Taleb wrote on Facebook.\n\u201cI want one reasonable person to answer me or to give me just one benefit, even a single benefit, of Hamas\u2019s weapons.\u201d\nHamas isn\u2019t a \u2018static institution\u2019\nWhen an agreement was reached with Israel for a ceasefire and the release of some hostages in January, armed members of Hamas emerged en masse wearing their full uniform at a public square in Gaza City. It was Hamas\u2019 reminder that the group was still alive months after Israel set out to destroy it.\nIn the weeks that followed, Hamas choreographed ceremonies to parade its strength during scheduled releases of Israeli hostages captured on October 7. The ceremonies were so infuriating to Israel that it threatened to withdraw from the agreement.\nIn one of the most recent videos circulating on social media and geolocated by CNN, an armed group of masked men chanted for Hamas\u2019 armed wing \u2013 Al Qassam Brigades \u2013 while carrying automatic weapons. The video, released in August, showed masked militants setting fire to a vehicle and threatening \u201cthieves and businessmen\u201d who steal aid.\nSelf-styled as \u2018Al Rade\u2019a, or \u2018The Deterring,\u2019 the subgroup said in its first statement that it was formed by Hamas\u2019 security apparatus to \u201cdeter monopolizing businessmen\u201d and gangs who collaborate with Israel in Gaza.\nAl Rade\u2019a claimed that it executed people who belong to gangs that collaborate with Israel, including six people last month in the southern city of Khan Younis.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not forget Hamas is not a static institution or figure. They started out with a certain number of fighters on October 7, and then given the destruction and deaths inside Gaza, they\u2019ve also gone on a recruiting spree and replaced folks that were there,\u201d Alex Plitsas, a military expert and senior non-resident fellow for the Atlantic Council, told CNN.\nIt is near-impossible to establish an accurate picture of the number of Hamas militants remaining in Gaza City.\n\u201cHamas is not a uniform force, while their government was elected in Gaza and they have institutions that they\u2019re responsible for, their military wing doesn\u2019t operate like a uniform military\u2026 they effectively act like an insurgent force for an elected government that is in the middle of a war, and they don\u2019t play by the rules,\u201d Plitsas said.\n\u2018They know we\u2019re coming\u2019\nThe takeover and occupation of the largest city in northern Gaza, which Netanyahu said is one of the last Hamas strongholds, will require the Israeli military to bring in 60,000 more reserve troops and extend the service of another 20,000, in addition to those already called up.\nAn Israeli source said this week that the military will give Palestinians approximately two months to evacuate the densely populated area before the assault begins, setting a symbolic deadline of October 7, the two-year mark of the war.\nAnother Israeli military official could not provide a figure on how many Hamas forces are in Gaza City, but the official said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has not ventured deep into the area in nearly two years of war.\nThe expectation is that troops will face an enemy that has had time to dig in, using its extensive tunnel network under Gaza City\n\u201cThey know we\u2019re coming,\u201d the official said, \u201cso they prepare for that.\u201d\nThe Hamas \u201cmetro,\u201d as Israel calls it, is more than just a system of uniform tunnels, the official explained. It\u2019s far more complex than the IDF anticipated, with larger strategic hubs and branches, as well as smaller tactical tunnels for quick movement and surprise attacks.\nOnce Gaza City is evacuated, the IDF will likely strike an expanded set of targets in the dense urban area, the official added, including sites that weren\u2019t struck before because of the density of the civilian population.\nBut Israel\u2019s incoming operation is drawing warning from governments and aid groups, who remain concerned about the Israeli military\u2019s conduct over the past two years amid a high civilian casualty rate, reports of war crimes, human rights abuses and aid blockades.\n\u201cThe Israeli military would probably take a couple of months to go into every single building, clear it up and hit all the tunnels. Is it possible? Yes,\u201d Plitsas said, \u201cIs it extremely difficult and will it take a lot of troops to clear and take all the territory? Also yes.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "Netanyahu has shifted from phased ceasefires to demanding a comprehensive deal that would release all hostages and end the war on Israel\u2019s terms, while simultaneously advancing a massive assault on Gaza City. He has not responded to the latest Qatari\u2011Egyptian proposal, which offers a 60\u2011day ceasefire and partial hostage release, causing confusion and anger among hostage families and sparking protests. Hamas has accepted the new proposal, but Israel insists on disarmament and full control of Gaza, a stance that far\u2011right allies support and critics say will prolong the conflict. The U.S., especially Trump, backs Israel\u2019s hardline approach, while the Biden administration has been more cautious, leading to a split in international mediation efforts. The dual strategy of negotiating and waging war has intensified domestic and international pressure on Israel to secure a comprehensive agreement.",
