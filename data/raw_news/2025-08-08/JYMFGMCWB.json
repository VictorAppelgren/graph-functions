  "title": "SoftBank reportedly bought Foxconn's Ohio factory for the Stargate AI project",
  "description": "Foxconn spent years promising electric vehicles would be built at the former Chevy Cruze factory. Now it will make AI servers.",
  "content": "The mystery buyer of the former General Motors factory owned by Foxconn in Lordstown, Ohio is apparently SoftBank, according to Bloomberg News. SoftBank wants to use the factory to build AI servers as part of the Stargate data center project being spearheaded by the Japanese conglomerate, OpenAI, and Oracle.\n\nThe report comes just a few days after Foxconn announced it had sold the factory, along with electric vehicle manufacturing equipment that was inside of it, to a buyer it only referred to as \u201cCrescent Dune LLC\u201d \u2014 an entity that was created in Delaware in late July. Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what this means for Monarch Tractor, a California-based startup that develops electric and autonomous farm equipment. Monarch was the lone customer of Foxconn\u2019s contract manufacturing operation at the Ohio factory, after the other three of the Taiwanese tech giant\u2019s prospective customers went bankrupt. Monarch CEO Praveen Penmesta has not responded to emailed requests for comment.\n\nSoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle announced the Stargate project one day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. The effort currently involves a large data center that is being built in Texas, but the companies involved have said they want to build infrastructure in other states and countries. In May, Bloomberg reported that SoftBank was struggling to line up funding for the project, and that it was already being hampered by Trump\u2019s myriad trade wars.\n\nFoxconn bought the factory in late 2021 from electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said his company wanted to develop the site into the \u201cmost important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.\u201d\n\nThe sale closed in 2022 and, one year later, Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy. Prospective customers like Fisker Inc. and California startup IndiEV also went out of business.",

      "text": "Foxconn has sold the former GM factory it has owned for three years after failing to stand up any meaningful, large-scale electric vehicle production there.\nThe pivot marks the second major failure of Foxconn to deliver on its promises to help revive U.S. manufacturing. The iPhone-maker once promised to build a giant LCD factory in Wisconsin \u2014 a project that Donald Trump called the \u201ceighth wonder of the world\u201d during his first term \u2014 and wound up underdelivering to an extreme degree.\nFoxconn says the buyer is an \u201cexisting business partner\u201d named \u201cCrescent Dune LLC,\u201d an entity that was created in Delaware just 12 days ago, according to records filed with the state. Matt Dewine, a spokesperson for Foxconn, declined to say more about the buyer.\nFoxconn sold the factory and land for around $88 million and machinery and equipment from its EV subsidiaries for around $287 million, Taiwan stock exchange filings show.\nA Foxconn representative told Automotive News the company will remain \u201cinvolved in the manufacturing of products for customers at the Lordstown facility\u201d and claimed it is \u201ccommitted to customers and suppliers\u201d in the automotive industry. But The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Foxconn now plans to build AI servers at the factory. Dewine did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.\nFoxconn announced the deal to buy the former GM plant in 2021 for $230 million, when it was still owned by EV startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said it was going to be the \u201cmost important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.\u201d\nWhile Foxconn was developing EVs of its own in Asia, it was also focused on contract manufacturing in the United States. And, in short order, three of the electric vehicle companies Foxconn hoped would occupy the factory went bankrupt.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nFoxconn actually built a few EVs at the factory for the now-defunct Lordstown Motors. But the Taiwanese electronics giant wound up in a bitter fight with that troubled EV startup. Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy in June 2023, and accused Foxconn \u2014 which had become an investor in the startup \u2014 of \u201cstarving it of cash,\u201d and said it \u201cmaliciously and in bad faith destroyed that business.\u201d\nFoxconn also took a flier on a small EV startup called IndiEV, claiming it would build its electric SUV at the Ohio factory. IndiEV filed for bankruptcy in October 2023 with less than $3 million in the bank. Foxconn was supposed to build EVs for Fisker Inc. as well. Fisker filed for bankruptcy in June 2024.\nA fourth company, Monarch Tractor, has not had much of an impact, with Foxconn making no more than a few hundred electric tractors. Monarch\u2019s CEO, Praveen Penmetsa, did not respond to an emailed request for comment about whether its tractors will continue to be built in Ohio."
