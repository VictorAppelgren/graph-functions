These principles are designed to guide journalists working with any news platform, including newspapers, websites, mobile devices, video, social media channels and live story events.\nWE ARE COMMITTED TO:\nI. Seeking and reporting the truth in a truthful way\n- We will be honest in the way we gather, report and present news - with relevancy, persistence, context, thoroughness, balance, and fairness in mind.\n- We will seek to gain understanding of the communities, individuals and issues we cover to provide an informed account of activities.\n- We will hold factual information in editorials and other opinion pieces to the same standards of accuracy as news stories.\n- We will treat information from unofficial sources, which may include social media, with skepticism and will seek to corroborate information.\n- When considering news content created outside of the Network, we will factor the credibility of the source and weigh the value and accuracy of information provided.\nII. Serving the public interest\n- We will uphold First Amendment principles to serve the democratic process.\n- We will be vigilant watchdogs of government and institutions that affect the public, fighting to ensure that the public\u2019s business is conducted in public.\n- We will seek solutions as well as expose problems and wrongdoing in order to effect change for the good in the communities we serve.\n- We will provide public forums for diverse people and views.\n- We will reflect and encourage understanding of the diverse segments of our community.\n- We will provide editorial and community leadership.\n- We will seek to promote understanding of complex issues.\n- When sharing editorials and other opinion articles, we will encourage and promote views that foster understanding, insight and civil discourse. We seek to offer viewpoints that represent various views on a particular topic.\n- We will consider providing free access to some news coverage during public safety emergencies and as a public service when appropriate, such as elections.\nIII. Exercising fair play\n- We will treat people with respect and compassion.\n- We will correct errors promptly.\n- We will strive to include all sides relevant to a story. When news develops and we can\u2019t include important perspectives immediately, we will share updates, including additional sources, when possible. We also will share attempts to reach sources who add value to the story.\n- We will explain to audiences our journalistic processes to promote transparency and engagement.\n- We will give particular attention to fairness in relations with people unaccustomed to dealing with the news media.\n- We will use confidential sources as the sole basis for published information only as a last resort and under specific procedures that best serve the public\u2019s right to know.\nIV. Maintaining independence\n- We will remain free of outside interests, investments or business relationships that may compromise the credibility of our news reporting.\n- We will maintain an impartial, arm\u2019s-length relationship with anyone seeking to influence the news.\n- We will not support political campaigns or causes through the display of bumper stickers, signs, pins, public/private donations, participation in demonstrations, petitions or in social media posts.\n- Individual viewpoints that might cause readers to question our impartiality in news coverage should remain private. This principle does not apply to those who are paid to write and share opinion.\n- We will avoid potential conflicts of interest and eliminate inappropriate influence on content.\n- We will be free of improper obligations to news sources, newsmakers and advertisers.\n- We will not blur the line between advertising and editorial content. We will provide appropriate disclosures, exercise transparency and avoid actual or implicit commercial endorsements by our journalists.\n- When sponsorships of news are appropriate, we will not allow them to determine, change or restrict content.\nV. Acting with integrity\n- We will act honorably and ethically in dealing with news sources, the public and our colleagues.\n- We will obey the law.\n- We will observe standards of decency.\n- We will take responsibility for our decisions and consider the possible consequences of our actions.\n- We will be conscientious in observing these principles.\n- We will use technological tools with skill and thoughtfulness, avoiding approaches that skew facts, distort reality, or sensationalize events.\n- We will not plagiarize or fabricate information.\n- We will not alter photos, video or audio to misrepresent events or mislead audiences.\nEthical Guidelines and Policy for Gannett Journalists Regarding AI-Generated or Assisted Content\nPURPOSE\n- AI (Artificial Intelligence) is emerging as a helpful tool in publishing. However, before using any AI-generated content, you must discuss the purpose and how it was produced with your editor. This policy aims to provide ethical guidelines for journalists using AI-generated content: whether written, visual, or audio to ensure that their reporting is transparent, accurate, fair, and accountable.\n- If you and your editor decide AI-generated or assisted content is acceptable or warranted, these are our guidelines.\nTRANSPARENCY & DISCLOSURE\n- AI is not transparent about its own sources. Until sourcing transparency improves, journalists need to treat AI-gen content as they would \u201coff the record\u201d sources, meaning it can be used for ideas and leads, but we need to confirm whatever it tells us with an \u201con the record\u201d source.\nACCURACY & VERIFICATION\n- If AI-assisted content is approved for publication, journalists must disclose the use of AI and its limitations to their audience. AI-generated content must be verified for accuracy and factuality before being used in reporting. Journalists must ensure that the content they use is accurate and free of errors.\nEDITORIAL JUDGMENT\n- Journalists must maintain their professional judgment and decision-making abilities when using AI-generated content. They must ensure that the content they use meets our editorial standards and values.\nFAIR USE\n- Journalists must comply with the legal and ethical considerations of fair use when using AI-generated content. They must ensure that they do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nAI VISUAL TOOLS (Dall-E & Others)\n- AI-generated visual content is illustrative, does not accurately represent a real situation, and is not an accurate rendition of a genuine moment or news situation. There is an extremely high bar for the potential use of AI-generated visual content, requiring full disclosure to the viewer. Gannett does not use AI-generated photo-realistic images in our news coverage. Any use of visual AI should be approved by a managing editor or higher, the photo and video director, or the standards editor.\nPRIVACY & DATA PROTECTION\n- Journalists must ensure that the use of AI-generated content does not violate the privacy rights of individuals. They must ensure that the data used to generate content is collected and used in compliance with data protection laws.\nBIAS & DISCRIMINATION\n- Journalists must be aware of any potential biases in the AI-generated content they use. They must ensure that the content they use does not discriminate against any individual or group based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.\nSAFETY & SECURITY\n- Journalists must be mindful of the potential risks of using AI-generated content for public safety and security. They must ensure that the content they use does not contribute to disinformation or misinformation that may cause harm.\nACCOUNTABILITY & RESPONSIBILITY\n- Journalists must take responsibility for any errors or inaccuracies in the AI-generated content they use. They must be accountable to their audience and take corrective action if errors are found.\nINCLUSIVITY & DIVERSITY\n- Journalists must ensure that they are inclusive and diverse in their use of AI-generated content. They must ensure that the content they use reflects the diversity of their audience.\nTRAINING & DEVELOPMENT\n- Journalists must receive adequate training and development to use AI-generated content effectively and ethically. They must stay informed about the latest developments in AI technology and its ethical implications.\nCONCLUSION\nThese ethical guidelines and policies aim to ensure that journalists use AI-generated content in a transparent, accurate, fair, and accountable manner. Gannett I USA TODAY I USA TODAY Network journalists are advised to follow our AI guidelines when requesting access to use and/or open AI tools and services.\nJournalists must discuss the purpose and production of any AI-generated content with their editor and Gannett\u2019s AI Council before using it. They also need an executive sponsor and approval from the AI Council for a project to move forward.\nThese guidelines are provided to maintain the highest standards of journalism and to maintain the trust of our audience. Gannett takes the use of AI-generated content very seriously and has put in place several safeguards to protect our intellectual property and ensure AI is used responsibly and ethically. Gannett does not use AI-generated photo-realistic images in our news coverage.\nThe guidelines may be revised periodically to reflect the evolving ethical implications of AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology.\nV2 updated on December 4, 2023"
