  "description": "Bill Maher questioned if the View's hosts were qualified to represent the fairer sex during a conversation on his podcast, days after Donald Trump called for the show's cancellation.",
  "content": "Bill Maher suggested the female panel who host The View are an embarrassment to their gender.\n\nThe talk show host made the cutting remark during a conversation with Drew Barrymore on his Club Random podcast that aired Monday, where he questioned if the ABC show's hosts were really qualified to represent the fairer sex.\n\n'And I did [the show] like a year ago. And I like everyone,' he said. 'But I don't know if they're really, at this moment, the best advertisement for women.'\n\nHe added: 'I'm friendly with some of the ladies on [the program] and I love them, but that show's a lot.\n\n'You know, I love Whoopi and Joy. Those are the two I really know,' he continued.\n\nBarrymore countered the show merely follows 'a format', leading Maher - an ardent Democrat - to assert: 'They say some things that are, like, not helpful, to say, elections.'\n\nBarrymore, 50, replied by praising the progressive 'for seeing all angles.' The show hosted by Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin, Ana Navarro, Sara Haines, and Alyssa Farah Griffin, meanwhile, has come under fire for doing the exact opposite.\n\nJust a few days ago, a Media Research Center study found the show had welcomed 102 liberal-leaning guests this year and not a single conservative. The show is currently on hiatus until September.\n\nJust before the break, the Trump administration called for the show's cancelation after Behar claimed on-air the president was 'jealous' of his predecessor Barack Obama.\n\nBehar had been responding to Trump's insistence that Obama should be criminally prosecuted for 'treason' over what Trump has called the Russian 'hoax' during the 2016 election.\n\n'It's no surprise that \"The View's\" ratings hit an all-time low last year,' a White House spokesperson said in response. '[Behar] should self-reflect on her own jealousy of President Trump's historic popularity before her show is the next to be pulled off air.'\n\nOn Wednesday, former panelist - and outspoken Trump critic - Rosie O'Donnell weighed in.\n\nShe claimed ABC was in the midst of 'reviewing the [show's] liberal bias' following the release of the Media Research study.\n\nShe claimed the 'review' was 'code' for the show's impending cancellation and that her old network was in the process of scrubbing 'any program that doesn't align with Trumpism.'\n\n'This isn't about bias - this is about obedience,' she wrote in a post to TikTok, after years of back-and-forths with the commander in chief that go back to the early 2000s.\n\n'Because it's not enough to run the country into the ground[.] You have to control what people see[,] what they hear[,] what they think,' she said.\n\nThe View, she added, is 'a little too much woman - a little too much truth' for the conservative.\n\nMaher, meanwhile, recently took issue with an offhand comment from Goldberg that compared life as a black American to living in Iran.\n\nDuring his most recent appearance on the program in May 2024, he was grilled by Hostin over his support for Israel, amid its war in Gaza.\n\nLast week, a source pushed back on the claim the program does not welcome conservative talking points\n\n'Without going into detail about the show's booking process, there is wide outreach across the aisle,' the insider said.\n\nIn May, multiple outlets reported that Disney - ABC News' parent company - and the network had asked the hosts to tone down their political rhetoric.\n\nThe women found the requests 'silly,' the Daily Beast reported, with sources telling the publication the group ultimately decided 'they were just going to keep doing their thing.'",

      "text": "Fox News' Guy Benson slammed 'The View' as an 'insane asylum' after a study from Media Research Center's NewsBusters determined the show has welcomed 102 left-leaning guests this year.\nThe study, which looked at episodes from January 6 through July 25, also said 'zero conservatives' appeared on the daytime opinion show.\nArnold Schwarzenegger, an anti-Trump Republican, appeared last month. The former Golden State governor was discounted due to voting for Kamala Harris, NewsBusters editors said.\nBenson, a Fox News contributor, reacted live to the results on Friday's 'Fox & Friends.'\nThere, host Ainsley Earhardt joked: 'So \"The View\" only has one view?'\nCo-host Brian Kilmeade similarly lamented: 'They used to be somewhat balanced,' recalling how Barbara Walters started the show in 1997 'to get some political points of view \u2013 no script \u2013 and just get a conversation going and let us know what women talk about when they're together.\n'Then what happened? It ends up being an angry Democratic show,' he asserted, paving the way for Benson.\n'I am actually surprised by this because 102 seems a little low,' he began, eventually proclaiming, 'It's an insane asylum now.'\n'The View' has had 102 left-leaning guests this year, a study from Media Research Center's NewsBusters found. Pictured, former President Joe Biden on the program in May\nFox News' Guy Benson slammed 'The View' as an 'insane asylum' on Friday's Fox & Friends as a result, after the analysis looked at guests from January 6 through July 25\n'The left talked for years about bringing back the fairness doctrine,' he told Kilmeade, Earhardt, and Lawrence Jones. 'This was an obsession of theirs to try to clamp down on the success of [conservative] talk radio.\n'If they had succeeded and had gotten the fairness doctrine, \"The View\" would be out of business for that reason alone,' Benson argued. '[The show] would be basically illegal.'\nJones then chimed to accuse the show's co-hosts - Whoopi Goldberg, Ana Navarro, lone Republican Alyssa Farrah Griffin, Joy Behar, Sara Haines, and Sunny Hostin - of being hostile toward right-leaning guests they have had on in the past.\nKilmeade, meanwhile, called the discrepancy the 'least surprising stat ever.'\nDaily Mail has contacted ABC, which broadcasts The View, for comment.\nA source pushed back on claims the program does not welcome conservative talking points.\n'Without going into detail about the show's booking process, there is wide outreach across the aisle,' the insider told Daily Mail.\nGuests this year, meanwhile, have included the likes of former President Joe Biden, rising Congressional Democrat Jasmine Crockett, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer and Elissa Slotkin.\nJohn Fetterman, Pennsylvania's centrist Democrat senator, appeared on the program on January 27.\nGoldberg, Haines, Navarro, and Hostin went on to pepper him with questions about his relationship with Donald Trump, whom Fetterman defended.\nUpon hearing the statistics, host Ainsley Earhardt joked: 'So \"The View\" only has one view?'. Co-host Brian Kilmeade added: 'They used to be somewhat balanced'\nGuests this year have also included rising Texas Democrat and Senator Chuck Schumer, as well as several other progressive politicians and stars\nThe closest the show got to hosting a conservative was its episode with well-known California Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was not classified as a conservative by right-leaning website for voting for Kamala Harris\nA slew of left-leaning stars have appeared since, including famed feminist Gloria Steinem and actor Javier Bardem.\nStars like Mariska Hargitay and Republican Kelsey Grammer were not counted, however, due to the study not including stars whose segments did not touch on politics, the media analyst who did the research, Nick Fondacaro, said.\n'The View has undergone some major changes since last year which proves it has gotten more extreme,' he told Daily Mail Friday.\n'Prior to their winter break, the cast would defend and praise their reliance on legal notes, only to abandon the practice altogether in the latter half of the season.\n'Meanwhile, they\u2019ve gotten more comfortable with making wild, unsubstantiated actuations in the early months of the second Trump administration, which seem to not ruffle feathers in ABC\u2019s Standards and Practices division.'\nHe added how longtime Executive Producer Brian Teta has repeatedly 'defended the show\u2019s biases and legal notes by arguing it functions like the editorial pages of a newspaper.\n'But even newspapers have editorial standards that keep them from saying some of the unhinged things that The View has said this year,' he claimed.\nThe Media Research Center, meanwhile, is a conservative watchdog group started in 1987.\nNewsbusters - a team 'dedicated to exposing & combating liberal media bias,' according to its website' - was launched in 2005."

      "text": "Furious Rosie O'Donnell says ABC is preparing to cancel her old show The View\nA former host of The View thinks the daytime opinion program could soon be taken off the air.\nRosie O'Donnell made the remarks in a pointed post to TikTok Wednesday where she said ABC was 'reviewing the [show's] liberal bias'.\nDays before, a Media Research Center study found the show had welcomed 102 liberal-leaning guests so far this year and not a single conservative. The results pertained only to guests who discussed politics.\nO\u2019Donnell, in turn, claimed 'The View' does not have any bias, but that the 'review' was 'code' for the show's cancellation.\nShe claimed her old network was in the process of scrubbing 'any program that doesn't align with Trumpism.'\n'This isn't about bias - this is about obedience,' she wrote, blaming her old nemesis who she has fought with since the early 2000s.\n'Because it's not enough to run the country into the ground[.] You have to control what people see[,] what they hear[,] what they think.'\nThe View, she said, is 'a little too much woman - a little too much truth' for the conservative. O'Donnell moved to Ireland after Trump's re-election.\nRosie O'Donnell made the remarks in a pointed post to TikTok Wednesday where she said ABC was 'reviewing the [show's] liberal bias'\nDays before, a Media Research Center study determined the show had welcomed 102 liberal-leaning guests in 2025 and not a single conservative. The results pertained only to guests who discussed politics\nNearly two decades ago, she manned The View as it moderator, from 2006 to 2007.\nThe brief tenure was marred by the first of several feuds with the future president, as well as frequent on-air arguments about George W. Bush's policies during the Iraq War. She briefly returned to in 2014 before leaving again, this time for good, the following year.\nO'Donnell - just before divorcing her second wife, Michelle Rounds, in 2015 - blamed 'personal issues' at the time.\nThen, in 2015, during his first campaign, Trump brought up O'Donnell again during the Republican primary debates. Fox host Megyn Kelly had been questioning him about his history of using derogatory terms to describe women -leading him to defend the practice, 'Only [when it came to] Rosie O'Donnell.'\nO'Donnell, 63, responded by tweeting, 'Try explaining that 2 ur kids'.\nThe two have been at odds ever since.\nIn another post to TikTok, O'Donnell accused both ABC and CBS of 'capitulating' to Trump through their respective lawsuit settlements - one of which involved on-air comments from George Stephanopoulos and the other a 60 Minutes interview.\n'Apparently the truth is dangerous now. They say they want 'balance'. But what they mean is silence,' O'Donnell wrote in her Wednesday post.\nO'Donnel manned The View as it moderator from 2006 to 2007. The brief tenure was marred by the first of several feuds with the future president, as well as frequent on-air arguments about the Iraq War. She returned in 2014 before leaving again after just five months\nO'Donnell slammed Trump as a dictator this time around, renewing their years-long feud in the process\n'Silence anything that doesn't praise the orange messiah and his golden escalator of lies.\n'And listen, I've done TV[.] I've sat in boardroom where men in suits use words like \"optics\" and \"midwestern moms\" and \"brand alignment.\"\n'When what they mean is: Can You not say the things [you] say.'\nShe went on to claim, 'We are in a dictatorship with good lighting,' before concluding the lengthy post by posing a question.\n'When they cancel The View - who's gonna be left to say \"This is insane\"?' she asked.\n'Because the most dangerous sound in the world is a woman who knows that she's talking about - and refuses to stop.'\nLast week, a source pushed back on the claim the program does not welcome conservative talking points.\n'Without going into detail about the show's booking process, there is wide outreach across the aisle,' the insider said.\nDaily Mail contacted ABC for comment."

      "text": "The View's Joy Behar sparks war with MAGA women over her bold claims about the 'ladies Trump likes'\nThe View host Joy Behar boldly claimed that Donald Trump hates 'strong women,' despite the president placing several in key cabinet positions.\nThe 82-year-old comedienne made the comment on Wednesday's show while discussing Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's recent response to Trump slamming her as 'one of the dumbest people in Congress.'\n'Mr. President, don't take your anger out on me - I'm just a silly girl,' Ocasio-Cortez, 35, said in a self-filmed video.\nBehar dove into the feud on Wednesday, offering her own take on the president's preferences.\n'So, you know, my experience with him, and my observation of him, is he really doesn't really like strong women. He likes beautiful, obedient women who compliment him,' she stated.\n'So, he's not going to like [AOC],' Behar added later. 'Somehow, this type of woman really gets in his kishkas.'\nCo-host Sunny Hostin, 56, would also get in on the action.\n'Well, he projects too also, right?' the former federal prosecutor chimed in. 'He's calling her dumb and unqualified. Come on.'\nThe View host Joy Behar claimed that Donald Trump dislikes 'strong women' during a discussion about his feud with New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n'So, you know, my experience with him, and my observation of him, is he - he really doesn't really like strong women,' Behar said. 'He likes beautiful, obedient women who compliment him'\nThe hosts didn't mention any of the women Trump appointed to high-profile roles in his administration, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Defense Secretary Kristi Noem, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, among others.\nBehar relayed her own experiences with Trump to try to make her point.\n'Even back in the day when I used to do jokes about his hair, you know - but every male every male comedian did jokes about his hair, but he went after me in particular,' she said.\nBehar did ask Hostin if she believed young Democrats like AOC had any success connecting with people.\n'I think absolutely,' Hostin said, before pointing to New York's mayoral primary, where voters picked Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani over former Governor Andrew Cuomo.\n'I think you need to be an opposition party at this point in this country,' she added. 'And so, I think Democrats are finding their way with these younger voices.'\nBehar's remarks came a couple weeks after she awkwardly paused the show's conversation about riots in Los Angeles to talk up Governor Gavin Newsom's good looks.\n'Gavin Newsom brings me back to really handsome presidents,' she said, also mentioning 'JFK and Obama.'\n'Wouldn't it be nice to have an articulate gorgeous president like that again?'\nThe View hosts didn't mention any of the women Trump appointed to high-profile roles in his administration, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Defense Secretary Kristi Noem and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt\n'Mr. President, don't take your anger out on me - I'm just a silly girl,' Ocasio-Cortez, 35, said in a self-filmed video Tuesday after Trump called her 'one of the dumbest people in Congress'\nPictured, the Truth Social post that stated the tiff, where Trump took aim at the rising Democrat\nLast month, top brass at ABC News and its parent company Disney were said have asked the ladies to dial back their complaining about Trump.\nThe talk show has been filled with criticisms of the commander-in-chief and his policies, with mostly kind words for Democrats.\nThe show's usual moderator, Whoopi Goldberg, came under fire last week for comparing life as a black American to living under Iran's authoritarian regime.\nThe network has not commented on the ongoing criticism."

      "text": "Black Americans are slamming Whoopi Goldberg after she claimed on The View that living in the United States as a black person is just as bad as living in Iran.\nThe Oscar-winning actress sparked the firestorm during a segment in which co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin praised American freedoms, saying, 'The U.S. in 2025 is not as bad as Iran in 2025.'\nGoldberg, who is worth an estimated $60 million, immediately cut in: 'Not if you're Black.'\nThat single remark set off a wave of outrage online, especially from fellow black Americans who accused the Sister Act star of being completely out of touch with reality.\nTikTok user Key (@nahzfontee) was among the first to call Goldberg out, posting a passionate video criticizing her for comparing herself to people in a country where women can be jailed or even killed for basic freedoms.\n'You're a multi-millionaire black woman on national television saying this?' Key said.\n'That alone proves the difference between America and Iran. You have the freedom to say that. In Iran, women can't show their hair.\n'They have no freedom of speech, no religion, no protest. Meanwhile, you can march down the street screaming that Trump's a king and nothing happens.'\nWhoopi Goldberg sparked backlash from back Americans after claiming being black in the US is 'no different' than living in Iran\nTikToker @nahzfontee said Whoopi's comment proved her own privilege: 'You're a multi-millionaire Black woman on national TV - that alone shows the difference'\nTikTok creator Bigswol blasted Goldberg, saying, 'Not one Black American would trade places with anyone in Iran. What are you talking about?'\nTikTok creator Bigswol (@bigswol) took it a step further, accusing Goldberg of spreading false victimhood while enjoying privileges most people can't dream of.\n'Can someone tell Whoopi Goldberg she's rich and black?' he said in his video.\n'What the f**k you mean life in America is just as bad as Iran? Women in Iran can't even speak freely. You couldn't wear your favorite outfit over there.'\n'America has the most black millionaires in the world - and you're one of them. Nobody in this country would trade places with someone in Iran. And the wildest part? Nobody on The View even pushed back.'\nBut the most blistering takedown came from The Cartier Family, a group of YouTubers whose reaction video went viral.\n'She up $60 million talking about her life hard because she black,' host Brandon Rhone said. 'I'm sick of the whole black people are oppressed shit.'\n'It's more black people killing each other than the police is killing us. But nobody want to bring it up.'\n'There's no way I heard that right,' said the other host Soloman Brant, calling out Goldberg's privilege. 'You probably have security, you're Whoopi Goldberg!'\nThe Cartier Family called Goldberg's remarks 'delusional,' pointing to U.S. freedoms, wealth, and opportunity: 'This is the best place to be Black'\nSo far, Goldberg has not responded to the growing backlash. But with clips still circulating and high-profile creators weighing in, the pressure to clarify - or double down - is mounting.\nThey added that Goldberg's roles, such as in the movie The Color Purple which examines black poverty, may have distorted Goldberg's view of present-day America.\n'So do they believe America is still in like the 1940s, 30s?' chimed co-host Tahj Whitfield.\nHe continued: 'I truly believe we did not suffer as much as our great grandparents and our great great grandparents. We are so blessed right now in America, bro. I don't understand why people keep trying to push us back.'\n'If you're black and you're poor and you're born in Africa, you're going to die poor. In America, if you're born poor, you have an opportunity to become rich.'\nIran is described as by the US State Department, an 'an authoritarian theocratic republic' ruled by strict Shia Islamist laws.\nMultiple nationwide protests began in the country in 2022 after the death of Mahsa (Jina) Amini who was taken into custody by the morality police for refusing to wear a hijab.\nThe protests resulted in the deaths of more than 500 people after lethal force was used to quell the backlash.\nAlyssa Farah Griffin sparked the debate by saying the U.S. in 2025 is 'not as bad as Iran' - prompting Whoopi Goldberg's viral response\nIran is described as by the US State Department, an 'an authoritarian theocratic republic' ruled by strict Shia Islamist laws. Protests broke out in 2022 after a woman died in the custody of the country's morality police who arrested her for not wearing a hijab\nThe View's discussion came amid escalating conflict between Tehran and Israel. Pictured: damage is seen at the building and studios of the Iranian Radio and Television Broadcasting Corporation (IRIB) headquarters after it was reportedly targeted by an Israeli strike\nThe View's take on the Iran conflict comes as many of Trump's MAGA loyalists urge him to stick to the isolationist platform that first got him elected.\nOn Wednesday, Tucker Carlson released a bombshell interview where Senator Ted Cruz appeared to admit the U.S. is already involved in strikes on Iranian targets.\n'You said Israel was,' Carlson said.\n'I've said 'we'. Israel is leading, but we're supporting them,' Cruz replied.\n'You're breaking news here,' Carlson responded. 'The U.S. government just denied, on Trump's behalf, that we're acting offensively for Israel.'\nEarlier this week, both Carlson and former Trump strategist Steve Bannon warned on their podcasts that a strike on Iran would be disastrous.\nThey blamed the intelligence 'deep state' and war-hawk Republicans for swaying Trump toward military involvement \u2014 and warned it could mean 'the end of his presidency.'\nTrump brushed off Carlson's criticism at the G7, saying, 'I don't know what Tucker Carlson is saying.

      "text": "Whoopi Goldberg whined that her multimillion-dollar job co-hosting The View can 'feel like hell,' after returning from a two-week break following backlash over her controversial comments on Iran.\nThe 69-year-old delivered the self-pitying remark at the start of Tuesday's episode, as she and her fellow hosts were met with an especially raucous round of applause.\n'Let us say this to you: Thank you for that, because sometimes this gig can feel like hell,' she said, moved by the display.\n'And sometimes you feel like people are just angry at you all the time. So, to get a welcome like this this morning, we really appreciate it.'\nGoldberg had returned to The View on Monday for the first time in two weeks, following a trip overseas and the show's annual weeklong summer hiatus.\nBefore she left, she faced blowback for insisting to her fellow panelists that living in the United States as a black person is just as bad as living in Iran.\nShe appeared to shrug off the controversy by attending a ceremony in Sicily, where she discussed the 'challenges' of being a celebrity.\nWhile her salary has not been disclosed publicly, an insider told The US Sun in 2022 that she earned a cool $8million as The View's highest paid host.\n'[S]ometimes this gig can feel like hell,' Whoopi Goldberg said on The View Tuesday. 'And sometimes you feel like people are just angry at you all the time'\nGoldberg returned to The View this week following a trip overseas and the show's annual weeklong summer hiatus\nGoldberg, who has appeared on the show since 2007, is worth an estimated $60million.\nHer frequent off-the-cuff remarks have gotten her into hot water over the years, including her June 18 comments that human rights violations in Iran were on par with the treatment of marginalized groups in the US.\nThe response on social media was swift ruthless, with comics Bill Maher and Adam Carolla also weighing in to pan the star.\nAfter appearing to reference the criticism on Tuesday, viewers again tore into the star.\n'Out of touch celebrity says $8 million a year to co-host the View can be hell,' one commenter wrote on X.\n'Then donate [your salary] buffoon,' another added.\n'Of course it sometimes feels \"like hell\" for Whoopi. She thinks she's immune from feedback to the garbage takes she and her co-hosts bring to The View?' a third asked.\n'What arrogance.'\nGoldberg, who has appeared on The View since 2007, is worth an estimated $60million\nDays before, Goldberg earned widespread condemnation on social media - including calls for her firing - for telling cohost Alyssa Farrah Griffin human rights violations being perpetrated by the Iranian regime were on par with the treatment of marginalized groups in the US\nIn 2019, Goldberg told The New York Times that she viewed her hosting gig just 'a job.'\n'These are not conversations that I\u2019m having with my friends,' she said. 'If they were, we\u2019d be doing it differently. My friends and I can talk about things in-depth in a different way than you can on television.'\nIn November, she claimed she was still on The View after so many years because she needed the money, before comparing the situation to those of millions of other working Americans.\n'I appreciate that people are having a hard time,' she said. 'Me, too. I work for a living. If I had all the money in the world, I would not be here, OK? So, I'm a working person, you know?'\nThe Daily Mail contacted ABC News for comment."

  "argos_summary": "Bill Maher criticized the female hosts of 'The View,' suggesting they are not the best representatives for women, during a podcast with Drew Barrymore. This comes amid controversy surrounding the show's liberal bias, highlighted by a study showing it featured 102 liberal guests and no conservatives this year. Rosie O'Donnell expressed concern that ABC might cancel 'The View' due to its perceived bias, while Whoopi Goldberg faced backlash for comparing the experience of Black Americans to living in Iran, prompting widespread criticism on social media.",
