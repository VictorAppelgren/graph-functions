  "description": "Xi, Putin and Modi\u2019s rare show of unity holds the potential for deeper economic shifts beyond the photo ops.",
  "content": "\u201cThe classic maxim of foreign policy is unite your friends and divide your adversaries,\u201d former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said on Bloomberg Television\u2019s Wall Street Week with David Westin. \u201cWe have pursued policies that have managed to unite our adversaries and divide our friends.\u201d \u201cThis should be an occasion for some real soul-searching on the part of America\u2019s national security thinkers,\u201d said Summers, a Harvard University professor and paid contributor to Bloomberg TV. The idea of a strategic Eurasian triangle consisting of Russia, India and China dates back to the late 1990s, when Moscow sought to diversify its foreign policy away from an over-reliance on the US and Europe. The group struggled to take flight, but eventually spawned the creation of the BRICS grouping that also included Brazil and South Africa. That bloc has since expanded to include nations like Indonesia and several from the Middle East, and is set to hold a virtual call next week to discuss Trump\u2019s trade policy. Since Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, China has served as Russia\u2019s most important economic partner, even as it has been careful to appear like it\u2019s not overtly supporting his war effort. Xi\u2019s government has also become bolder in testing US sanctions: Last week, it took a single cargo of liquefied natural gas from Arctic LNG 2, a US-sanctioned project dear to Putin\u2019s heart and energy ambitions. Under the previous administration, the US was quick to slap retaliatory sanctions on any vessel or company that appeared to be circumventing restrictions on Russian LNG. It isn\u2019t clear how Trump will react, and the White House hasn\u2019t commented on the trade. \u201cRigorous enforcement of US sanctions, including against Novatek and Arctic LNG 2, has been key to maintaining pressure on the Kremlin to reverse course and accept a diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine,\u201d said Geoffrey Pyatt, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center and former US assistant secretary of state who helped craft Arctic LNG 2 sanctions under the Biden administration. It\u2019s still unclear if China\u2019s pipeline deal with Moscow is more signal than substance. China and Russia haven\u2019t agreed on a price yet \u2014 a key sticking point before the project can move forward. Beijing will likely only greenlight the pipeline if Moscow accepts a price close to what domestic Russian consumers pay, according to a report from Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy. What\u2019s more, if all the capacity is used, China would be taking more than 40% of its imported gas from Russia \u2014 a dramatic shift for a country that has long sought to keep a diverse stable of suppliers as part of its energy security drive. China also imports significant volumes of gas from Qatar and Australia. China\u2019s progress in renewable energy is also closing the window for the Russians to get more gas into the Chinese market, according to Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. \u201cThe Russians, in order to get there, will really need to accept the conditions that make China happy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so far, I think it seems that the conditions look like straight robbery.\u201d The roadblocks to closer cooperation with India are also high. Modi\u2019s trip to China is more a rebalancing away from the US orbit than an embrace of Beijing, according to an Indian official familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified. The trust deficit on both sides remains high after ties suffered following a 2020 border clash, and India is far away from easing restrictions on Chinese investment, the official said. While Modi attended the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Tianjin, he stayed away from Xi\u2019s military parade in Beijing several days later. The Indian leader also stopped in Japan, a key US ally, ahead of the China visit. \u201cModi was going to send some signals that he\u2019s going to maintain India\u2019s strategic autonomy, and to show that he has options, and won\u2019t be pushed around,\u201d said Daniel Kritenbrink, former assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs in the Biden administration. \u201cBut India is going to be careful and cautious. And I remain cautiously optimistic that because of the fundamental common interests that the United States and India hold, that there\u2019s an opportunity to bring things back together there as well.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s administration has kept up a steady barrage of verbal attacks on India in recent weeks, with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro accusing New Delhi of funding Russia\u2019s campaign in Ukraine and even calling it \u201cModi\u2019s war.\u201d New Delhi and Moscow have deep ties dating back to the Soviet era, and Russia is India\u2019s biggest supplier of weapons. The US president also accused Xi, Putin and Kim of conspiring against the US during their meeting in China. On Wednesday, he said that US relations with all of the leaders who were in Beijing was \u201cvery good,\u201d while warning that \u201cyou\u2019ll see things happen\u201d if Putin doesn\u2019t meet Trump\u2019s deadline for holding talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Western officials familiar with the matter were impressed with Xi\u2019s parade, calling it a military version of China\u2019s 2008 Olympics that signals it will soon become a US peer. They also said the events in China made them believe that Xi viewed himself as the boss of both Putin and Kim, and will only cooperate with them on favorable terms to Beijing. A goal of the parade was to showcase China\u2019s industrial prowess by featuring weaponry made with Chinese technology, according to Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University and former diplomat seen as close to the government in Beijing. The aim, he said, \u201cis to tell the world \u2018there is no need to fight a war with China anymore. You won\u2019t win anyway.\u2019\u201d Beijing often seeks to instill stability in its capital markets around major national events. Ahead of the parade, Chinese stocks jumped about 10% in August, but that rally is starting to cool. At the SCO summit, Xi also sought to extend China\u2019s influence among more than 20 leaders in attendance by taking veiled shots at the US and emphasizing that all countries should be treated equally. While the body is often dismissed as a bureaucratic talk shop in the West, the expansion of membership in recent years and shift to create a development bank helps provide a more stable partner to leaders roiled by Trump. Many of the leaders who went to Beijing aren\u2019t necessarily trying to side with China or Russia against the US, but rather to look for space to maneuver between the world\u2019s big powers and preserve flexibility. \u201cThey were hoping I was watching,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I was watching.\u201d",

      "text": "Mortgage rates hang on Bank of Canada decision\nRobert McLister: Money market traders are pricing in a two in three shot of a Bank of Canada rate cut on Sept. 17\nIf the bond market is right, mortgage shoppers could be in for some savings this month.\nAs this is being written, money market traders are pricing in a two in three shot of a Bank of Canada rate cut on Sept. 17. That may seem ludicrous with average core inflation above the central bank\u2019s three per cent inflation tolerance, but traders are unfazed.\nMuch hangs on employment and inflation data, however. They\u2019re due out Sept. 5 and 16, so we\u2019ll have to wait to see if they seal the deal. Either way, there\u2019s at least no visible threat of near-term rate hikes.\nOn the national mortgage leaderboard, pricing hasn\u2019t changed in two weeks. If we get bearish economic data, fixed rates should dip closer to \u2014 or in some cases, lower into \u2014 the high three per cent range.\nAs it stands, lenders like True North Mortgage feature fixed rates as low as 3.99 per cent for a three-year term. Some regional providers, like Butler Mortgage, advertise five to ten basis points lower.\nAs for the lowest published five-year fixed, Citadel Mortgage leads at 3.94 per cent insured and 4.04 per cent uninsured. If you\u2019re in Ontario, however, you may find more savings at Ratebuzz. Its five-year clocks in at 3.84 per cent insured and 3.94 per cent uninsured.\nLast but not least, expect floating rates to garner more interest with talk of Bank of Canada cuts \u2014 although one cut would simply bring variables in line with the lowest three-year fixed rates. And markets are only pricing in one more drop in prime after that.\nRobert McLister is a mortgage strategist, interest rate analyst and editor of MortgageLogic.news.

      "text": "3 examples show how to get the most out of an RESP\nJamie Golombek: Beyond strategy, contributing to an RESP as soon as possible is critical due to the benefits of compound investing\nReviews and recommendations are unbiased and products are independently selected. Postmedia may earn an affiliate commission from purchases made through links on this page.\nSeptember is back-to-school month, and if you\u2019ve got kids and there\u2019s any remote chance they will pursue post-secondary education, contributing to a registered education savings plan (RESP) is the best school supply you can purchase this fall.\nWhile RESPs have been around for decades, they really took off back in 1998 with the introduction of the matching 20 per cent Canada Education Savings Grants (CESGs). Yet, here we are, nearly 30 years later, and in my experience not all parents (or, in some cases, grandparents) are fully taking advantage of these plans. To this end, here\u2019s a quick refresher of RESP basics, followed by some contribution strategies worth considering this fall.\nThe RESP is a tax-deferred savings plan that helps an individual, typically a parent, save for a child\u2019s post-secondary education. Up to $50,000 of contributions can be made per child, although only the first $36,000 will attract CESGs since they are limited to $7,200 per child. The basic CESG is equal to 20 per cent of the first $2,500 of contributions made into an RESP for each year, or up to the first $5,000 in contributions if sufficient CESG carry forward room exists from prior years.\nSimilar to other registered plans, the RESP is essentially a wrapper in which you can hold various eligible investment products such as guaranteed investment certificates (GICs), mutual funds and individual stocks and bonds, depending on the type of RESP you open. Unlike registered retirement savings plans, contributions to an RESP are not tax-deductible nor are they taxable when withdrawn.\nThe main benefit of the RESP is the ability to have all earnings (capital gains, dividends and interest) on the investments inside the RESP accumulate tax-free until withdrawn. When the funds are paid out, they are included in the student\u2019s income but presumably the child will be in a low- or zero-tax bracket, on account of the various tax credits available to them. These include, most commonly, the basic personal amount ($16,129 for 2025) and the federal tuition amount (average Canadian undergrad tuition in 2025 is $7,360), meaning the first $23,500 of earnings come out tax-free.\nWhen funding an RESP, the first missed opportunity is that some parents only start thinking about contributing to their kids\u2019 RESPs well after their children are born. But contributing to an RESP as soon as possible can be much more beneficial due to the benefits of compound investing.\n- CRA denied taxpayer benefits because of his Airbnb classification\n- CRA penalizes taxpayer for failure to report the sale of residential real estate\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nLet\u2019s take a look at three funding strategies. In each case, we\u2019ll model how much money you can accumulate in an RESP over 18 years, when most kids will begin a post-secondary education and will need to begin drawing funds from their RESP. In the examples below, I\u2019m going to assume that RESP subscribers will initially invest all their RESP contributions and the CESGs in a pure equity portfolio, which will generate a six per cent rate of return annually. When the prospective student turns 16, however, with only two years or so left until funds are needed for post-secondary education, the portfolio will be switched into less volatile fixed income investments, such GICs. In this case, I prefer a laddered approach where GICs of two-, three-, four- and five-year durations are purchased, such that funds become available each year of a four-year program. We\u2019ll assume an average three per cent rate of return for those final two years of accumulation.\nExample 1: Michael starts saving for his son Robbie\u2019s education the year he is born. If he contributes the $2,500 maximum amount needed each year to maximize the CESGs until he hits $36,000 of contributions in the year Robbie turns 14, he will have accumulated nearly $81,091 in Robbie\u2019s RESP by the time he turns 18, using the rates of return above.\nExample 2: Contrast this with Jay, who only starts saving for his son Zev\u2019s education when he turns 10 by contributing $1,000 in that year and then $5,000 each year from age 11 to 17 to catch up on all prior years\u2019 CESGs. By the time Zev is 18, assuming the same rates of return, Zev\u2019s RESP would only be worth $52,387, despite Jay having contributed the same $36,000 that Michael contributed, and having received the full $7,200 in CESGs.\nFinally, for those parents who can afford to do so, consider maximizing the tax-deferred (or, most probably, tax-free) compounding by contributing beyond the annual amounts needed to maximize the CESGs. This can be done by making an additional lump sum contribution of $14,000 as early as possible, bringing the total amount contributed up to the lifetime maximum of $50,000 per child.\nExample 3: Following this advice, Gila decides to contribute to Harry\u2019s RESP using the maximum funding strategy by contributing $16,500 in the year Harry is born, consisting of the $2,500 needed to get the first year\u2019s 20 per cent matching CESG, and the extra $14,000 permitted to maximize the lifetime $50,000 contribution without passing up on future years\u2019 CESGs. In this case, using the rates of return above, Gila will be able to accumulate $118,822 in Harry\u2019s RESP by the time he turns 18.\nBut, would it ever make sense to forego the annual CESGs (beyond the first year\u2019s $500) by contributing $50,000 in Year 1? Over the years, I\u2019ve had several advisers suggest this to me, arguing that the value of the tax-free accumulation of a larger upfront lump sum RESP contribution can outweigh foregoing most of the CESGs.\nTo model this, I compared a lump-sum $50,000 investment in Year 1, which attracted the first year\u2019s CESG of $500, using the same rates of return as above. At the end of 18 years, the value of the RESP was $136,100. But while this may initially appear to be a better result than Gila\u2019s CESG-maximizing strategy, we need to take into consideration that Gila had the use of the funds she didn\u2019t contribute to the RESP during those 18 years (until they are actually contributed).\nFor example, in Year 1, Gila contributes $16,500 to Harry\u2019s RESP, but she has the $33,500 to invest personally outside the RESP. Once we take this into account, it\u2019s clear that Gila\u2019s strategy beats a lump-sum RESP contribution using the rates of return assumptions above.\nBut is this always true? Not necessarily. We calculate that if Gila were able to achieve a 6.6 per cent or higher annual rate of return for the first 16 years, her RESP would indeed be worth more with an initial $50,000 contribution, foregoing future years\u2019 CESGs.\nJamie Golombek, FCPA, FCA, CFP, CLU, TEP, is the managing director, Tax & Estate Planning with CIBC Private Wealth in Toronto.

      "text": "Xi Unites World Leaders Sick of Being Pushed Around by Trump\nXi, Putin and Modi\u2019s rare show of unity holds the potential for deeper economic shifts beyond the photo ops.\n(Bloomberg) \u2014 While Donald Trump is hard to beat when it comes to stealing the global spotlight, Xi Jinping proved this week he can also put on a good show.\nIn memorable scenes reminiscent of a family reunion, the Chinese leader embraced and riffed with some of the world\u2019s preeminent strongmen \u2014 including an impromptu conversation with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un about organ transplants and immortality.\nBut the most surprising image may have been a chummy three-way gathering between Xi, Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who made his first visit to China in seven years. Beyond the symbolism of seeing them laugh and hold hands, as well as Modi riding in Putin\u2019s limo, they also hold the biggest potential for real economic shifts that could offer the world an ability to withstand threats from Trump to impose financial pain for defying the US.\nFor the moment, the ties that bind them center primarily around energy. One of the big outcomes this week was Russia saying it has reached an agreement with China on the Power of Siberia 2, a vast pipeline that Beijing had sought to delay for years, as it neither needs the fuel nor wants the energy dependence on its neighbor. While key details over pricing are still unclear, the decision to move forward now served as a sign of deeper cooperation. At the same time, India signaled it would keep buying oil from Putin\u2019s regime, something Trump has already targeted with punitive tariffs.\n\u201cThis is a significant and serious inflection point,\u201d said Matthew Bartlett, a former State Department appointee under President Trump during his first term. \u201cIt really reveals how energy security is critical to national security in the 21st century.\u201d\nThe newfound bonhomie in China this week also raises a question of the business, economic and strategic implications if the three nations were to move closer together in other areas, even if that remains a remote possibility at the moment. The China-Russia nexus alone serves as a powerful counterweight to the US, prompting Trump and others in his administration to warn earlier this year about the dangers of their budding alliance.\nAdding India to the mix would make that an even more formidable partnership. The three nuclear powers collectively hold a third of the world\u2019s population, vast natural resources and world-beating manufacturing power. Today they account for roughly a quarter of global gross domestic product, up from about 5% at the turn of the century, and China has made steady strides in coming closer to catching up to the most cutting-edge US technology.\nWhile the obstacles to more fulsome economic integration among the three nations are vast, Trump\u2019s use of tariffs to inflict economic damage opens the door to imagine the possibilities. Beyond energy, that could include efforts to build up an alternatives to the dollar, expand investment opportunities and explore other ways to withstand US sanctions and tariffs. In China this week, Xi and Modi pledged to resume direct flights between the nations.\n\u201cThe classic maxim of foreign policy is unite your friends and divide your adversaries,\u201d former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said on Bloomberg Television\u2019s Wall Street Week with David Westin. \u201cWe have pursued policies that have managed to unite our adversaries and divide our friends.\u201d\n\u201cThis should be an occasion for some real soul-searching on the part of America\u2019s national security thinkers,\u201d said Summers, a Harvard University professor and paid contributor to Bloomberg TV.\nThe idea of a strategic Eurasian triangle consisting of Russia, India and China dates back to the late 1990s, when Moscow sought to diversify its foreign policy away from an over-reliance on the US and Europe. The group struggled to take flight, but eventually spawned the creation of the BRICS grouping that also included Brazil and South Africa. That bloc has since expanded to include nations like Indonesia and several from the Middle East, and is set to hold a virtual call next week to discuss Trump\u2019s trade policy.\nSince Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, China has served as Russia\u2019s most important economic partner, even as it has been careful to appear like it\u2019s not overtly supporting his war effort. Xi\u2019s government has also become bolder in testing US sanctions: Last week, it took a single cargo of liquefied natural gas from Arctic LNG 2, a US-sanctioned project dear to Putin\u2019s heart and energy ambitions.\nUnder the previous administration, the US was quick to slap retaliatory sanctions on any vessel or company that appeared to be circumventing restrictions on Russian LNG. It isn\u2019t clear how Trump will react, and the White House hasn\u2019t commented on the trade.\n\u201cRigorous enforcement of US sanctions, including against Novatek and Arctic LNG 2, has been key to maintaining pressure on the Kremlin to reverse course and accept a diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine,\u201d said Geoffrey Pyatt, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center and former US assistant secretary of state who helped craft Arctic LNG 2 sanctions under the Biden administration.\nIt\u2019s still unclear if China\u2019s pipeline deal with Moscow is more signal than substance. China and Russia haven\u2019t agreed on a price yet \u2014 a key sticking point before the project can move forward. Beijing will likely only greenlight the pipeline if Moscow accepts a price close to what domestic Russian consumers pay, according to a report from Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.\nWhat\u2019s more, if all the capacity is used, China would be taking more than 40% of its imported gas from Russia \u2014 a dramatic shift for a country that has long sought to keep a diverse stable of suppliers as part of its energy security drive. China also imports significant volumes of gas from Qatar and Australia.\nChina\u2019s progress in renewable energy is also closing the window for the Russians to get more gas into the Chinese market, according to Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\u201cThe Russians, in order to get there, will really need to accept the conditions that make China happy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so far, I think it seems that the conditions look like straight robbery.\u201d\nThe roadblocks to closer cooperation with India are also high. Modi\u2019s trip to China is more a rebalancing away from the US orbit than an embrace of Beijing, according to an Indian official familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified. The trust deficit on both sides remains high after ties suffered following a 2020 border clash, and India is far away from easing restrictions on Chinese investment, the official said.\nWhile Modi attended the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Tianjin, he stayed away from Xi\u2019s military parade in Beijing several days later. The Indian leader also stopped in Japan, a key US ally, ahead of the China visit.\n\u201cModi was going to send some signals that he\u2019s going to maintain India\u2019s strategic autonomy, and to show that he has options, and won\u2019t be pushed around,\u201d said Daniel Kritenbrink, former assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs in the Biden administration. \u201cBut India is going to be careful and cautious. And I remain cautiously optimistic that because of the fundamental common interests that the United States and India hold, that there\u2019s an opportunity to bring things back together there as well.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s administration has kept up a steady barrage of verbal attacks on India in recent weeks, with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro accusing New Delhi of funding Russia\u2019s campaign in Ukraine and even calling it \u201cModi\u2019s war.\u201d New Delhi and Moscow have deep ties dating back to the Soviet era, and Russia is India\u2019s biggest supplier of weapons.\nThe US president also accused Xi, Putin and Kim of conspiring against the US during their meeting in China. On Wednesday, he said that US relations with all of the leaders who were in Beijing was \u201cvery good,\u201d while warning that \u201cyou\u2019ll see things happen\u201d if Putin doesn\u2019t meet Trump\u2019s deadline for holding talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\nWestern officials familiar with the matter were impressed with Xi\u2019s parade, calling it a military version of China\u2019s 2008 Olympics that signals it will soon become a US peer. They also said the events in China made them believe that Xi viewed himself as the boss of both Putin and Kim, and will only cooperate with them on favorable terms to Beijing.\nA goal of the parade was to showcase China\u2019s industrial prowess by featuring weaponry made with Chinese technology, according to Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University and former diplomat seen as close to the government in Beijing.\nThe aim, he said, \u201cis to tell the world \u2018there is no need to fight a war with China anymore. You won\u2019t win anyway.\u2019\u201d\nBeijing often seeks to instill stability in its capital markets around major national events. Ahead of the parade, Chinese stocks jumped about 10% in August, but that rally is starting to cool.\nAt the SCO summit, Xi also sought to extend China\u2019s influence among more than 20 leaders in attendance by taking veiled shots at the US and emphasizing that all countries should be treated equally. While the body is often dismissed as a bureaucratic talk shop in the West, the expansion of membership in recent years and shift to create a development bank helps provide a more stable partner to leaders roiled by Trump.\nMany of the leaders who went to Beijing aren\u2019t necessarily trying to side with China or Russia against the US, but rather to look for space to maneuver between the world\u2019s big powers and preserve flexibility.\n\u201cThey were hoping I was watching,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I was watching.\u201d\n\u2014With assistance from Jing Li, Alex Wickham, Soo-Hyang Choi and Jasmine Ng.\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Real estate regulator proves ineffective in case involving $10.5 million in missing trust deposits\nReal Estate Council of Ontario takes credibility hit after brokerage firm iPro Realty mishandled millions of dollars\nThe watchdog overseeing Ontario\u2019s real estate industry has taken a credibility hit after a brokerage firm, iPro Realty, was found to have mishandled millions of dollars in its trust account.\nThe provincial regulator, the Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO), received heavy criticism from industry members and the public for not enforcing discipline on those responsible for the mismanagement.\nRECO faced the harshest criticism from the very registrants it regulates \u2014 the province\u2019s agents and brokers. Recognizing that trust is the industry\u2019s true currency, its members responded quickly, demanding stricter penalties for senior leadership at the brokerage firm.\nRECO is the only real estate watchdog in Ontario, overseeing approximately 100,000 agents and brokers. The council\u2019s website states that \u201cRECO administers and enforces the law that regulates trading in real estate in Ontario and enhances consumer confidence in the real estate services sector.\u201d\nThe way RECO managed iPro Realty\u2019s financial irregularities has undermined its ability to serve as a regulator.\nUntil the scandal, iPro operated 17 offices, with headquarters in Mississauga, Ont. Teagan Sliz, writing for Storeys.com, explained how the scandal unfolded:\niPro Realty informed RECO in May that $10.5 million in consumer deposits and agent commissions were missing from its trust account. RECO is expected to conduct regular inspections, including site visits, of brokerages, but in iPro\u2019s case, four years had elapsed since the regulator\u2019s first inspection. RECO undertook its second inspection in May.\nFrom May to mid-August, RECO was aware of the financial mismanagement. However, its long-standing registrar, Joseph Richer, did not notify agents working for the brokerage or their clients. Instead, it issued a press release on Aug. 14 stating that it had reached a deal with iPro for its 2,400 agents to transfer to a new company called iCloud Realty. Essentially, iPro Realty was reborn under a different name, operating from the same offices in Mississauga.\n- Is there light at the end of the tunnel for real estate markets?\n- REITs get criticized for being part of the housing affordability problem, but it turns out they aren't\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nRECO identified iPro\u2019s cofounders, Rui J. Alves and Fedele Colucci, as responsible for the missing funds. As a result, their registration with RECO was suspended, prohibiting them from practicing real estate in Ontario.\nWith millions still unaccounted for, RECO chose not to pursue further action against the accused, one of whom, Alves, had served on RECO\u2019s board of directors.\nRECO advised the affected parties to seek reimbursement from insurance. Richer faced additional scrutiny for allowing the accused to escape with only a slap on the wrist, and without any fines or charges under the Provincial Offences Act. In late August, RECO\u2019s board retained a law firm to conduct an audit of iPro and Richer subsequently departed from the council.\nThe indifferent handling of iPro Realty by RECO undermined public confidence in the profession. Many questioned whether they could trust the brokerages with their money once it had been deposited into trust accounts. The agents working for iPro were equally impacted. Millions in agent commissions were also missing from the account.\nThe real estate industry depends on trust. Buyers and sellers in Canada rely on the advice of realtors and, based on that advice, they complete about half a million transactions worth hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Before the money moves from the buyer to the seller in a transaction, a portion remains in the realtor\u2019s trust fund for weeks or even months. Later, the funds are briefly held in escrow accounts managed by lawyers representing the parties.\nA positive development in the RECO saga is the firm stand taken by the real estate industry in calling for greater transparency and stricter enforcement of discipline and regulations. The Ontario Real Estate Association (OREA) represents the 100,000-strong industry professionals in Ontario. OREA also believes that RECO \u201clacks independent oversight, transparency and the teeth to hold bad actors accountable.\u201d OREA has since asked the Ontario government to \u201cbring RECO under Ombudsperson oversight.\u201d\nWhen millions of dollars in client deposits and agent commissions vanish without a trace and the regulator fails to recover the misappropriated funds or hold the guilty accountable, the industry\u2019s trustworthiness declines. For this reason, industry representatives have adopted a stance that is much stronger than that of the regulator, who only ordered an audit after it became clear that the provincial government would intervene if the regulator did not.\nRECO\u2019s track record as a regulator is poor. A 2022 report by the Auditor General of Ontario (AGO) revealed that RECO failed in its duty to oversee the industry properly. The AGO found it was slow to conduct audits and perform regular site visits. It also neglected to follow up or act upon thousands of complaints, and when it did respond, any penalties issued were minor compared to the amounts involved.\nThe provincial minister responsible for RECO, Stephen Crawford, has warned that if he is dissatisfied with the results of the iPro audit, he will appoint an administrator to take control of RECO\u2019s operations. Considering the regulator\u2019s apparent inability to function effectively, the minister should act quickly and avoid further delay.\nMurtaza Haider is the executive director of the Cities Institute at the University of Alberta and the Radhe Krishna Gupta Executive Chair in Cities and Communities at the Alberta School of Business.

      "text": "Getting to the bottom of the Crown Royal bottling plant closure as Doug Ford pours scorn on move\nPremier empties bottle of whisky on ground to protest decision that will cost Ontario town nearly 200 jobs\nA nearly 100-year-old signature Canadian alcohol brand is closing down a bottling plant in Ontario and moving those operations to the United States. Diageo PLC said on Thursday that it will close its facility in Amherstburg, Ont., which currently bottles Crown Royal Canadian whisky products. At a press conference on Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford lashed out at Diageo, calling the company a \u201cfew fries short of a Happy Meal\u201d and poured out a bottle of Crown Royal in protest. Here, Financial Post reporter Denise Paglinawan distills the reasons behind the company\u2019s decision.\nWhat happened last week?\nThe decision to shut the plant is part of the company\u2019s efforts to improve its North American supply chain, shifting bottling volume to the U.S., according to Diageo.\nThe company said it will cease operations at the bottling plant by February 2026 \u201cto be closer to its many U.S. Crown Royal consumers.\u201d\n\u201cThis was a difficult decision, but one that is crucial to improving the efficiency and resiliency of our supply chain network,\u201d said Diageo\u2019s president of North America supply, Marsha McIntosh.\nIn an emailed statement, Diageo said the decision was made with long-term growth in mind, to ensure the company can meet consumer demand well into the future. \u201cIt is not a reaction to the current trade environment,\u201d it said.\nWho is affected?\nThe closure will affect 168 employees at the facility. In a statement on Thursday, private sector union Unifor, whose Local 200 unit represents workers at Diageo Canada Inc. (Seagrams), said its members at the plant are \u201cprepared to fight to save\u201d those union jobs following the company\u2019s \u201cshock decision.\u201d\n\u201cThe decision to close the plant makes no sense and shows no loyalty to Canadian workers,\u201d said John D\u2019Agnolo, president of Unifor Local 200.\nDiageo said Crown Royal will continue to be mashed, distilled, blended and aged in Canada, as it has been since 1939. Bottling of Crown Royal whisky for the Canadian and non-U.S. export markets will continue at Diageo\u2019s Valleyfield, Que., facility, the company noted.\n- Canada Goose investors see tailwind as private-equity backer Bain Capital considers selling stake\n- No decision on sale of HBC leases to Ruby Liu as judge says he has 'a few things to think about'\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nOn top of that, Diageo said it will maintain its significant footprint across Canada, including at its Canadian headquarters and warehouse operations in the Greater Toronto Area and other bottling and distillation facilities in Gimli, Man., and Valleyfield.\n\u201cDiageo will continue to invest in Canada through its ongoing production, local operations and contributions to local communities,\u201d it said.\nWhy is Crown Royal special?\nCrown Royal Canadian whisky was first created in 1939 and is distilled along the western shore of Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba in the small town of Gimli, where most of its operations are located.\nCanadian spirits entrepreneur Sam Bronfman originally created the blend as a gift for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the first reigning monarchs to visit Canada, on their grand tour of the country that year. It is said that Bronfman meticulously trialled more than 600 blends before he was happy with the final product.\nOriginally owned by Seagram, the Crown Royal brand was acquired by Diageo in 2000 as part of a larger acquisition of Seagram\u2019s alcoholic beverage business.\nAside from Crown Royal, Diageo owns such brands as Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, Captain Morgan, Baileys, Don Julio and Guinness.\nHow will the move impact the economy?\nThe company claims the sale of Diageo products contributes more than $300 million in annual revenue to Canadian restaurants and bars, $125 million of that in Ontario.\nUnifor\u2019s D\u2019Agnolo said the facility is the largest employer in Amherstburg, Ont. and \u201cthe heart and soul of the community.\u201d\nDiageo said it will support affected Amherstburg employees through the transition and work alongside Unifor to provide assistance to its local union members.\nLast November, the multinational alcohol company paused its plans to build a $245-million whisky distillery in St. Clair Township in Ontario. First announced in 2022, Diageo initially said the site near Sarnia would start making Crown Royal Canadian whisky brand by 2025.\nThe company had not said how long the pause might last, or whether it will continue to build the plant.\n\u2022 Email: dpaglinawan@postmedia.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Posthaste: Canadians might be surprised at just how low U.S. tariffs on Canada's exports really are\nEconomists estimate over 90% of Canadian goods are entering the U.S. tariff free, pushing down the overall rate\nThe average effective tariff that was being charged on Canadian goods going to the United States was possibly as low as 2.4 per cent to 2.5 per cent, two economic houses suggest.\nNew reports by Oxford Economics Ltd. and Capital Economics Ltd. suggest the average tariffs being charged on Canadian exports to the U.S. in June were as low as 2.4 per cent and 2.5 per cent, well off a previously forecasted rate from Capital of nine per cent for the month.\n\u201cWith one full quarter of data with new U.S. tariffs now under our belt, it\u2019s increasingly clear that a much larger portion of Canadian goods are entering the U.S. duty-free than the official data on (Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement) compliance suggests should be the case,\u201d Michael Davenport, Canada economist at Oxford Economics, said in his report.\nNorth America economist Alexandra Brown, who estimated a tariff rate on Canadian exports to the U.S. of 2.5 per cent, citing data from the U.S. International Trade Commission, said in her report that \u201ceven if that figure understates the bill, as we suspect, firms appear to be benefiting from CUSMA exemptions to a greater extent than we first assumed.\u201d\nEconomists had previously expected U.S. tariffs to come in much higher, referencing U.S. Census Bureau data that said only 56 per cent of Canadian goods were compliant with CUSMA. But it appears that a bit more than 90 per cent of Canadian products are entering the U.S. free of such levies.\nDavenport said this is happening for a variety of reasons, including a separate classification under U.S. international trade rules that covers non-CUSMA compliant goods. It\u2019s also possible the U.S. data is just incomplete, wrong or that \u201cfluid and volatile U.S. trade policy could be causing customs agents to mislabel or misclassify some imported goods.\u201d\nAs of Sept. 1, Oxford is estimating the effective tariff rate on Canadian exports to the U.S. to rise to 6.2 per cent, recalibrated from 14.2 per cent, and it expects that rate to hold into 2026, based on the rising compliance rate and an increase in the tariff rate on non-CUSMA-compliant goods to 35 per cent and a new 50 per cent tariff on copper.\n- Posthaste: There's a new force driving the Canadian dollar \u2014 and it's pure gold\n- Posthaste: Forget the mid-life crisis, youth are the most miserable now\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nThe Bank of Canada estimates the tariff rate is in the neighbourhood of five per cent, according to senior deputy governor Carolyn Rogers during a press conference on July 30.
