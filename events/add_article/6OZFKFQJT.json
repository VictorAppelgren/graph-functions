      "summary": "Energy Secretary Chris Wright said offshore wind in the U.S. is unlikely to thrive without subsidies, citing high costs and limited domestic support, and criticized European reliance on expensive wind. He explained that the Trump administration’s secondary sanctions on Russian oil aim to cut Russia’s war funding, but the impact on U.S. consumers would be mitigated by increased domestic oil production. Wright also downplayed climate change concerns, framing the Department of Energy’s climate report as a realistic assessment that does not justify costly renewable projects.",
