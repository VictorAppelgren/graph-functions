  "description": "Bullish is set to go public on Wednesday after pricing its IPO above a range that was increased during its roadshow.",
  "content": "Cryptocurrency exchange operator Bullish (BLSH) is set to go public Wednesday at a valuation north of $5 billion as the IPO market looks set to continue a strong summer.\n\nThe company, which operates a crypto exchange and owns the prominent trade publication CoinDesk, said Tuesday that it had priced its IPO at $37 per share, above the $32-$33 range the company had expected in its second shot at making a public market debut.\n\nBullish first attempted to go public via a SPAC merger in 2021 that would have valued the company at $9 billion, but the deal fell through after regulatory scrutiny and Bullish withdrew its registration.\n\nThis is the company's second range increase for its latest offering, with the previous $32-$33 per share estimate raised from an earlier range of $28-$31 per share. At 30 million shares offered, the IPO price will see Bullish raise $1.1 billion and value the fintech company at $5.41 billion.\n\nThe company will be looking to ride the outsized success of recent go-publics like Figma (FIG) and Circle (CRCL) and serve as the latest sign the IPO window remains wide open after a few challenging years for investors.\n\nThrough Wednesday, 2025 has so far seen 133 IPOs come to market worth more than $50 million, up more than 58% from the same time last year, according to IPO tracker and ETF operator Renaissance Capital.\n\nAhead of its IPO, Bullish has already garnered major institutional interest, with asset management giant BlackRock and Cathie Wood's investment firm fund Ark Invest have expressed interest in purchasing up to $200 million worth of shares in the offering, according to securities filings.\n\n\"We now intend to IPO because we believe that the digital assets industry is beginning its next leg of growth,\" said Bullish CEO Thomas Farley, previously COO and president of the NYSE Group, in a letter to investors about Bullish's offering.\n\n\"I believe that the digital assets industry is at the inflection point of institutional adoption and Bullish is uniquely positioned at the center of this market. The compliant, institutional- focused market infrastructure model is time-tested and works, and Bullish is proud to be the one bringing this proven framework to the crypto landscape.\"\n\nBullish's main business comes from its Bullish Exchange, a digital assets spot and derivative exchange geared toward institutional-sized clients. The operator processed an average $2.6 billion in daily volume through Q1, according to the company's prospectus.\n\nBullish is also riding the coattails of this year's hot streak of fintech IPOs. When USDC stablecoin manager Circle Internet Group went public in June, its shares soared by 168% in their first day of trading. And while the price has come down, the stock is still up more than 130% since inception.",

      "text": "Crypto exchange Bullish is targeting a valuation of up to $4.23 billion in its United States listing, the company said in a filing on Monday, launching its roadshow to capitalize on the momentum built by digital assets amid regulatory clarity.\nCompanies leveraging crypto and related technologies have rallied on friendly policymaking from the Trump administration, such as the recent passage of the GENIUS Act, which provides an initial regulatory framework for stablecoins.\nBullish is seeking up to $629.3 million by offering 20.3 million shares priced between $28 and $31 each, marking its second attempt to go public in four years.\nAt the top of its proposed range, the company will list at a more than 52% discount to its $9 billion valuation target in a 2021 blank check merger that it called off in 2022, citing regulatory hurdles.\n\"When an IPO begins marketing, the bankers would rather undershoot on valuation and then price up, rather than overshoot and price down,\" said Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO-focused research and ETFs.\nBullish, backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, plans to convert a significant portion of the IPO proceeds to U.S.-dollar-denominated stablecoins with the assistance of one or more issuers of such tokens, it said in the filing.\nMajor stablecoin-issuer Circle Internet CRCL.K had a blowout debut on the NYSE in June and currently trades at more than 400% of its IPO price.\nInvestor focus\nBullish, whose CEO Thomas Farley previously served as president of the New York Stock Exchange, operates a crypto-trading exchange targeting institutions.\nIt also operates crypto news website CoinDesk, which it acquired from Barry Silbert's Digital Currency Group in 2023.\nBullish swung to a $349 million loss for the quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $105 million a year earlier, reflecting a fall in fair value of its crypto holdings.\nMeanwhile, public crypto exchange Coinbase reported a drop in second-quarter adjusted profit on Friday, due to a slowdown in trading, which dragged its shares down nearly 17%, even though the company recorded portfolio gains.\nSome investors tend to overlook the impact of quarterly swings in crypto prices when evaluating such companies, analysts have said.\nAccording to Renaissance Capital's Kennedy, investors will focus on \"how efficient (Bullish is) and how profitable it is as a pure exchange, without the impact of quarterly price changes.\"\nBullish aims to list on the NYSE under the symbol \"BLSH\". J.P.Morgan, Jefferies and Citigroup are the lead underwriters."

      "text": "The Circle IPO delivered the biggest two-day \u2018pop\u2019 since 1980\u2014but the crypto company left $3 billion on the table\nBy the close of Circle Internet Group\u2019s first trading day on Thursday, June 5, its stock had rocketed to $88, a 180% jump from the price institutional investors paid for their shares in the underwriting led by JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup. The upshot: The company and insiders combined left a gigantic amount of money on the table by agreeing to a price far below what investors were willing to pay. As Fortune previously noted, that \u201cleft on the table\u201d figure was the seventh largest in the history of all IPOs since 1980, exceeded only by the debuts of Visa, Airbnb, Snowflake, Rivian, DoorDash, and Coupang, the latter nicknamed \u201cthe Amazon of South Korea.\u201d\nCircle was just revving up. On Friday, June 6, its stock jumped another nearly 30% to $107.5. That additional leap hurtled the issuer for the USDC stablecoin to a historic record. Jay Ritter\u2014a professor at the University of Florida and the world\u2019s leading expert on IPOs\u2014confirmed that for all go-public events since 1980 that raised $500 million or more, Circle\u2019s two-day moonshot of nearly 250% ranks as by far the highest. The crypto favorite\u2019s showing easily eclipsed the second place \u201cpop\u201d sounded by software provider C3.ai of 209% at its 2020 entry on the Nasdaq.\nAll told, Circle sold 39 million shares, raising $1.145 billion after underwriting fees of $67 million. Had the shares fetched the $107.5 close on June 6 instead of the $31 (excluding fees) paid in the presale by the likes of mutual and hedge funds, the company and insiders combined would have collected $4.144 billion. Hence, as of the second day of trading, the IPO had left a staggering $3 billion on the table. Put simply, for every $1 going to the sellers, $3 in two-day gains flowed to the underwriters\u2019 Wall Street clients as a windfall.\nAt a market cap of $22 billion, Circle is selling at 140 times earnings. Given that treacherous valuation and the onslaught of stablecoin rivals invading its space, Circle is the epitome of an ultrahigh-risk stock. Money that might have been sitting in its treasury as a buffer against tough times vanished in this mind-bending spectacle that only the confluence of crypto craziness and Wall Street\u2019s genius for underpricing IPOs could have staged.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"
