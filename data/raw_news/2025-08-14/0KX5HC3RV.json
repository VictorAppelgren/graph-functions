  "title": "Draft of \u2018Make America Healthy Again\u2019 Report Suggests RFK Jr. Won\u2019t Push Pesticide Regulations",
  "description": "The report is not final, but indicates good news for the food and agriculture industries.",
  "content": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., second from right, the health secretary, during a news conference at the Health and Human Services Department in Washington in April.\n\nThe report is not final, but indicates good news for the food and agriculture industries.\n\nA highly anticipated White House report on the health of American children would stop short of proposing direct restrictions on ultraprocessed foods and pesticides, which the health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has called major threats, according to a draft of the document that was reviewed by The New York Times. The report, if adopted, would be good news for the food and agriculture industries, which feared far more restrictive proposals than the ones outlined in the draft. Through his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, Mr. Kennedy has sought to overhaul the nation\u2019s diet by pushing those industries to make major changes. The draft includes an array of policy proposals calling for research into topics like electromagnetic radiation, children\u2019s oral health, the role of the microbiome and the health effects of air quality and microplastics. It also recommends government action on a wide range of issues, including initiatives to increase breastfeeding rates, address infertility, promote physical activity and educate the public on the effects of vaping. Questions about a possible push for new pesticide regulations were raised in May when the White House released an initial report, from a presidential commission chaired by Mr. Kennedy, that raised strong concerns about possible links between pesticides and childhood diseases. It also linked the dominance of ultraprocessed foods in children\u2019s diets to a range of chronic diseases.\n\nThose findings touched off tensions between Mr. Kennedy\u2019s movement and Republican lawmakers who have traditionally drawn support from powerful agriculture, food and drug lobbyists. The Times obtained the draft of the new report from a former federal official. An industry official confirmed that it was nearly identical to a copy the administration had recently shown the official at the White House. Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, on Thursday would not verify the draft. At this stage, any draft would go through a number of revisions before it is finalized. The document The Times reviewed was labeled \u201cpre-decisional\u201d and dated Aug. 6. Called the \u201cMake Our Children Healthy Again Strategy,\u201d the report comes from the commission led by Mr. Kennedy, which includes cabinet secretaries and agency heads from across the government. The White House has not said when the report will be made public, though it was to have been presented to President Trump on Tuesday, the deadline set by Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order establishing the \u201cMAHA Commission.\u201d The final report is expected to be released in the coming weeks.\n\nThe draft report says that environmental regulators will work with \u201cfood and agricultural stakeholders\u201d to ensure that the public is aware of and confident in existing pesticide review procedures. It described those procedures as \u201crobust\u201d and did not propose new restrictions. It also says the Trump administration will back research on technologies to try to help farmers reduce pesticide use and on the health effects of Americans\u2019 cumulative exposure to chemicals. After the first report was published in May, agriculture groups, including the American Soybean Association and the National Corn Growers Association, urged the Trump administration to listen to farmers as the commission prepared its follow-up report outlining a strategy. The draft reviewed by The Times does not mention how the proposed research and the new policy initiatives would be funded or how much money might be allocated to them. But it says that the Department of Health and Human Services will form a working group to evaluate \u201coverprescription trends\u201d involving mental health medications, such as S.S.R.I.s and stimulants, for children. It reiterates Mr. Kennedy\u2019s pledge to study the \u201croot causes\u201d of autism.\n\nMr. Kennedy has spent much of his tenure as health secretary characterizing modern American childhood as a state of stress and sickness, with children mainly eating ultraprocessed food, which he has called \u201cpoison,\u201d tethered to screens and reliant on pills and shots. And he has railed against the pharmaceutical industry, which he says exerts undue influence over scientific research, all while the Trump administration has decimated funding for many academic research programs. Mr. Kennedy has also condemned scientific experts. In June, he fired all the members of an influential vaccine advisory panel. The first report, from May, reflected many of Mr. Kennedy\u2019s key talking points. It was heavily scrutinized. While some scientists applauded its focus on flaws within the American food system, many noted it misrepresented the scientific consensus on issues like vaccines. The report also cited studies that did not exist. In recent weeks, Mr. Kennedy\u2019s aides and allies have publicized what they described as the administration\u2019s most significant steps to improve American health. These include persuading some food makers to phase out petroleum-based food dyes, working with several states to remove soda and candy from their food stamp programs and trying to tighten oversight of food additives. The draft reiterates that the administration will continue these efforts.\n\nUltraprocessed foods, which make up about 62 percent of the calories consumed by U.S. children, are explicitly mentioned in the draft of the second report only once, in a line about the administration\u2019s effort to define them. The near-omission of ultraprocessed foods from the draft report raises questions about the administration\u2019s appetite for regulation, which the food industry is likely to vehemently oppose. The draft does describe prioritizing \u201cwhole, healthy\u201d foods in federal programs like those providing meals in schools. It suggests offering these foods in \u201cMAHA boxes\u201d for food stamp recipients. The draft touches on a number of other topics, including vaccines, a focus of Mr. Kennedy\u2019s. It says the health department will develop a framework for \u201cEnsuring America has the Best Childhood Vaccine Schedule.\u201d Mr. Kennedy, one of the nation\u2019s most prominent vaccine skeptics, recently pledged to overhaul the nation\u2019s system to compensate people harmed by vaccines. Earlier this month, he canceled nearly $500 million in contracts for mRNA vaccines.\n\nThe draft report also suggests that the government will consider developing guidelines that would limit marketing of unhealthy foods directly to children and will more vigorously enforce restrictions around direct-to-consumer drug advertising. It says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will update its recommendations on fluoride in water. On Tuesday, Calley Means, a senior adviser to Mr. Kennedy, spoke at a Heritage Foundation event on the role of agriculture in public health, presenting farmers as key players in American health care. \u201cWe are not going to win if the soybean farmers and the corn growers are our enemy,\u201d he said. There are signs that the report, as drafted, could land with a thud among Mr. Kennedy\u2019s followers. In July, 500 people, including leaders of advocacy groups aligned with Mr. Kennedy\u2019s movement, sent a letter to Mr. Kennedy and other members of the White House commission urging them to ban pesticides like glyphosate. Hundreds of people tied to the MAHA movement, including Vani Hari, a prominent food activist and MAHA influencer, also sent a letter addressed to Mr. Trump on Monday urging him to take action against protections for pesticide manufacturers. Over the first six months of his presidency, Mr. Trump has largely supported Mr. Kennedy\u2019s decisions, after urging him during the campaign to \u201cgo wild\u201d on health. This month, though, after Mr. Kennedy canceled the contracts for mRNA vaccines, Mr. Trump told reporters that the mRNA coronavirus vaccine development initiative from his first term, Project Warp Speed, was \u201cone of the most incredible things ever done in this country.\u201d He said he had scheduled a meeting with Mr. Kennedy to discuss the cancellations.",

      "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Purpose. American life expectancy significantly lags behind other developed countries, with pre\u2011COVID-19 United States life expectancy averaging 78.8 years and comparable countries averaging 82.6 years. This equates to 1.25 billion fewer life years for the United States population. Six in 10 Americans have at least one chronic disease, and four in 10 have two or more chronic diseases. An estimated one in five United States adults lives with a mental illness.\nThese realities become even more painful when contrasted with nations around the globe. Across 204 countries and territories, the United States had the highest age-standardized incidence rate of cancer in 2021, nearly double the next-highest rate. Further, from 1990-2021, the United States experienced an 88 percent increase in cancer, the largest percentage increase of any country evaluated. In 2021, asthma was more than twice as common in the United States than most of Europe, Asia, or Africa. Autism spectrum disorders had the highest prevalence in high-income countries, including the United States, in 2021. Similarly, autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis are more commonly diagnosed in high-income areas such as Europe and North America. Overall, the global comparison data demonstrates that the health of Americans is on an alarming trajectory that requires immediate action.\nThis concern applies urgently to America\u2019s children. In 2022, an estimated 30 million children (40.7 percent) had at least one health condition, such as allergies, asthma, or an autoimmune disease. Autism spectrum disorder now affects 1 in 36 children in the United States \u2014 a staggering increase from rates of 1 to 4 out of 10,000 children identified with the condition during the 1980s. Eighteen percent of late adolescents and young adults have fatty liver disease, close to 30 percent of adolescents are prediabetic, and more than 40 percent of adolescents are overweight or obese.\nThese health burdens have continued to increase alongside the increased prescription of medication. For example, in the case of Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, over 3.4 million children are now on medication for the disorder \u2014 up from 3.2 million children in 2019-2020 \u2014 and the number of children being diagnosed with the condition continues to rise.\nThis poses a dire threat to the American people and our way of life. Seventy-seven percent of young adults do not qualify for the military based in large part on their health scores. Ninety percent of the Nation\u2019s $4.5 trillion in annual healthcare expenditures is for people with chronic and mental health conditions. In short, Americans of all ages are becoming sicker, beset by illnesses that our medical system is not addressing effectively. These trends harm us, our economy, and our security.\nTo fully address the growing health crisis in America, we must re-direct our national focus, in the public and private sectors, toward understanding and drastically lowering chronic disease rates and ending childhood chronic disease. This includes fresh thinking on nutrition, physical activity, healthy lifestyles, over-reliance on medication and treatments, the effects of new technological habits, environmental impacts, and food and drug quality and safety. We must restore the integrity of the scientific process by protecting expert recommendations from inappropriate influence and increasing transparency regarding existing data. We must ensure our healthcare system promotes health rather than just managing disease.\nSec. 2. Policy. It shall be the policy of the Federal Government to aggressively combat the critical health challenges facing our citizens, including the rising rates of mental health disorders, obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. To do so, executive departments and agencies (agencies) that address health or healthcare must focus on reversing chronic disease. Under this policy:\n(a) all federally funded health research should empower Americans through transparency and open-source data, and should avoid or eliminate conflicts of interest that skew outcomes and perpetuate distrust;\n(b) the National Institutes of Health and other health-related research funded by the Federal Government should prioritize gold-standard research on the root causes of why Americans are getting sick;\n(c) agencies shall work with farmers to ensure that United States food is the healthiest, most abundant, and most affordable in the world; and\n(d) agencies shall ensure the availability of expanded treatment options and the flexibility for health insurance coverage to provide benefits that support beneficial lifestyle changes and disease prevention.\nSec. 3. Establishment and Composition of the President\u2019s Make America Healthy Again Commission. (a) There is hereby established the President\u2019s Make America Healthy Again Commission (Commission), chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Chair), with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy serving as Executive Director (Executive Director).\n(b) In addition to the Chair and the Executive Director, the Commission shall include the following officials, or their designees:\n(i) the Secretary of Agriculture;\n(ii) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;\n(iii) the Secretary of Education;\n(iv) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;\n(v) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency;\n(vi) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;\n(vii) the Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy;\n(viii) the Director of the National Economic Council;\n(ix) the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers;\n(x) the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy;\n(xi) the Commissioner of Food and Drugs;\n(xii) the Director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;\n(xiii) the Director of the National Institutes of Health; and\n(xiv) other members of my Administration invited to participate, at the discretion of the Chair and the Executive Director.\nSec. 4. Fighting Childhood Chronic Disease. The initial mission of the Commission shall be to advise and assist the President on how best to exercise his authority to address the childhood chronic disease crisis. Therefore, the Commission shall:\n(a) study the scope of the childhood chronic disease crisis and any potential contributing causes, including the American diet, absorption of toxic material, medical treatments, lifestyle, environmental factors, Government policies, food production techniques, electromagnetic radiation, and corporate influence or cronyism;\n(b) advise and assist the President on informing the American people regarding the childhood chronic disease crisis, using transparent and clear facts; and\n(c) provide to the President Government-wide recommendations on policy and strategy related to addressing the identified contributing causes of and ending the childhood chronic disease crisis.\nSec. 5. Initial Assessment and Strategy from the Make America Healthy Again Commission. (a) Make our Children Healthy Again Assessment. Within 100 days of the date of this order, the Commission shall submit to the President, through the Chair and the Executive Director, the Make Our Children Healthy Again Assessment, which shall:\n(i) identify and describe childhood chronic disease in America compared to other countries;\n(ii) assess the threat that potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures pose to children with respect to chronic inflammation or other established mechanisms of disease, using rigorous and transparent data, including international comparisons;\n(iii) assess the prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and weight-loss drugs;\n(iv) identify and report on best practices for preventing childhood health issues, including through proper nutrition and the promotion of healthy lifestyles;\n(v) evaluate the effectiveness of existing educational programs with regard to nutrition, physical activity, and mental health for children;\n(vi) identify and evaluate existing Federal programs and funding intended to prevent and treat childhood health issues for their scope and effectiveness;\n(vii) ensure transparency of all current data and unpublished analyses related to the childhood chronic disease crisis, consistent with applicable law;\n(viii) evaluate the effectiveness of current Federal Government childhood health data and metrics, including those from the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and the National Survey of Children\u2019s Health;\n(ix) restore the integrity of science, including by eliminating undue industry influence, releasing findings and underlying data to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, and increasing methodological rigor; and\n(x) establish a framework for transparency and ethics review in industry-funded projects.\n(b) Make our Children Healthy Again Strategy. Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Commission shall submit to the President, through the Chair and the Executive Director, a Make Our Children Healthy Again Strategy (Strategy), based on the findings from the Make Our Children Healthy Again Assessment described in subsection (a) of this section. The Strategy shall address appropriately restructuring the Federal Government\u2019s response to the childhood chronic disease crisis, including by ending Federal practices that exacerbate the health crisis or unsuccessfully attempt to address it, and by adding powerful new solutions that will end childhood chronic disease.\nSec. 6. Additional Reports. (a) Following the submission to the President of the Strategy, and any final strategy reports thereafter, the Chair and the Executive Director shall recommend to the President updates to the Commission\u2019s mission, including desired reports.\n(b) The Commission shall not reconvene, following submission of the Strategy, until an updated mission is submitted to the President through the Executive Director.\nSec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nFebruary 13, 2025."

It presents the stark reality of American children's declining health, backed by compelling data and long-term trends. More importantly, it seeks to unpack the potential dietary, behavioral, medical, and environmental drivers behind this crisis. By examining the root causes of deteriorating child health, this assessment establishes a clear, evidence-based foundation for the policy interventions, institutional reforms, and societal shifts needed to reverse course. To turn the tide and better protect our children, the United States must act decisively. During this administration, we will begin reversing the childhood chronic disease crisis by confronting its root causes-not just its symptoms. This means pursuing truth, embracing science, and enacting pro-growth policies and innovations to restore children's health. Today's children are tomorrow's workforce, caregivers, and leaders\u2014we can no longer afford to ignore this crisis. After a century of costly and ineffective approaches, the federal government will lead a coordinated transformation of our food, health, and scientific systems. This strategic realignment will ensure that all Americans\u2014today and in the future-live longer, healthier lives, supported by systems that prioritize prevention, wellbeing, and resilience. But real transformation requires more than vision\u2014it requires clarity. Before we act, we must fully understand the scope of the crisis, the conditions that created it, and the mechanisms through which it continues to grow. Without this foundation, interventions risk being reactive, fragmented, or ineffective. To Make America's Children Healthy Again, we must begin with a shared understanding of the magnitude of crisis and subsequently what's likely driving it. This assessment provides that foundation-grounding future efforts in a common scientific basis that identifies four potential drivers behind the rise in childhood chronic disease that present the clearest opportunities for progress: \u25cf Poor Diet: The American diet has shifted dramatically toward ultra-processed foods (UPFS), leading to nutrient depletion, increased caloric intake, and exposure to harmful additives. Nearly 70% of children's calories now come from UPFs, contributing to obesity, diabetes, and other chronic conditions. Aggregation of Environmental Chemicals: Children are exposed to an increasing number of synthetic chemicals, some of which have been linked to developmental issues and chronic disease. The current regulatory framework should be continually evaluated to ensure that chemicals and other exposures do not interact together to pose a threat to the health of our children. Lack of Physical Activity and Chronic Stress: American children are experiencing unprecedented levels of inactivity, screen use, sleep deprivation, and chronic stress. These factors significantly contribute to the rise in chronic diseases and mental health challenges. Overmedicalization: There is a concerning trend of overprescribing medications to children, often driven by conflicts of interest in medical research, regulation, and The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON\npractice.

The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON 5\nIntroduction The health of American children is in crisis. Despite outspending peer nations by more than double per capita on healthcare, the United States ranks last in life expectancy among high-income countries \u00b7 and suffers higher rates of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.12 Today's children are the sickest generation in American history in terms of chronic disease and these preventable trends continue to worsen each year,\u00b3 posing a threat to our nation's health, economy, and military readiness.

This economic growth has been a force for technology, health and agriculture innovations that have increased U.S. life expectancy by more than 30 years compared to 1900. But the same forces of modernization and industrialization have also introduced threats to our health and revealed growing inefficiencies in our ability to respond to them. Over the past two generations, we have failed to address the alarming rise in childhood chronic disease. Federal and state policy have sometimes been guided more by corporate profit than the public interest. Many of our leading scientific and medical institutions have grown complacent, defaulting to symptom management rather than harnessing gold-standard science to prevent and reverse root causes. The U.S. food and agricultural systems have embraced ultra-processed ingredients and synthetic chemicals. Meanwhile, our healthcare system has over-medicalized children, frequently masking and compounding underlying issues. Coupled with rising screen addiction and sedentary lifestyles, these factors are converging to produce a chronically stressed, sick, and isolated generation. This crisis is undermining national resilience and competitiveness. The purpose of this report is radical transparency about our current state to spur a conversation about how we can build a world \u2013 together \u2013 where: American farmers are put at the center of how we think about health. The American healthcare system thrives when disease is prevented and reversed, not just \"managed\" in a sick-care system. \u2022 The Great American Comeback of energy dominance powers Al technology that will develop new tools and push the frontiers of science to help us better understand how to measure and reverse chronic disease. \u25cf The next ten years see a revolution in living standards and prosperity, while we understand how to better manage the increased threats to our children's health that come from industrialization. America will begin reversing the childhood chronic disease crisis during this administration by getting to the truth of why we are getting sick and spurring pro-growth policies and innovations to reverse these trends. These concerning trends persist despite decades of federal investment in nutrition standards, physical activity campaigns, chemical risk assessments, and clinical quality initiatives. Still, childhood chronic disease continues to rise. To Make America's Children Healthy Again, we must go further. This assessment begins with a shared understanding of the crisis. 6 Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. (n.d.). Gross Domestic Product [GDP]. FRED, Federal Reserve Economic Data.

The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON 14\nWhat is Driving the Increase in Childhood Chronic Disease? Rising rates of childhood chronic disease are likely being driven by a combination of factors, including the food children are eating, the chemicals they are exposed to, the medications they are taking, and various changes to their lifestyle and behavior, particularly those related to physical activity, sleep and the use of technology. This report focuses on these four major drivers. The food American children are eating The American food system is safe but could be healthier. Most American children's diets are dominated by ultra-processed foods (UPFs) high in added sugars, chemical additives, and saturated fats, while lacking sufficient intakes of fruits and vegetables. This modern diet has been linked to a range of chronic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. .44 The excessive consumption of UPFs has led to a depletion of essential micronutrients and dietary fiber, while increasing the consumption of sugars and carbohydrates, which negatively affects overall health. 45 \u2022 Nearly 70% of an American child's calories today comes from ultra-processed foods 46 (increased from zero 100 years ago), many of which are designed to override satiety mechanisms and increase caloric intake. UPFS makeup over 50% of the diets of pregnant and postpartum mothers.47 American children's exposure to environmental chemicals The cumulative load of thousands of synthetic chemicals that our children are exposed to through the food they eat, the water they drink, and the air they breathe may pose risks to their long-term health, including neurodevelopmental and endocrine effects. \u2022 Over 40,000 chemicals are registered for use in the U.S.48 Pesticides, microplastics, and dioxins are commonly found in the blood and urine of American children and pregnant women\u2014some at alarming levels. 49 50 51 Children are particularly vulnerable to chemicals during critical stages of development-in utero, infancy, early childhood, and puberty.

American children's pervasive technology use Over the past four decades, American children have transitioned from an active, play-based childhood to a sedentary, technology-driven lifestyle, contributing to declines in physical and mental health. Specifically, these declines have been driven by increased screen time, reduced physical activity, and psychosocial stressors like loneliness, chronic stress, and sleep deprivation. \u2022 55 56 Teens average nearly 9 hours of non-school screen time each day.55 Over 70% of children, and 85% of teens, fail to meet the 2024 federal guideline of 60 minutes of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. 57 58 Nearly 80% of U.S. high school students do not sleep at least 8 hours per night, up from 69% in 2009.59 Persistent sadness and hopelessness among U.S. high school students surged between 2011 to 2021 from 28% to 42%, with female students' suicidal ideation rising 58% from 19% to 30%.60 In 2024, 73% of 16-24-year-olds reported loneliness, with 15% of young men having no close friendships-a fivefold increase since 1990.61 \u2022 Teens using social media over 3 hours daily face double the risk of anxiety and depression, with a 2022 meta-analysis showing each additional hour increases depression risk by 13%, and girls face nearly four times the risk of boys.62 American children are highly medicated \u2013 and it's not working The health system has aggressively responded to these increases in childhood chronic disease with increasing rates of pharmaceutical drug prescriptions which may cause further harm to the health of American children when used inappropriately. \u2022 Stimulant prescriptions for ADHD in the U.S. increased 250% from 2006 to 2016,63 52 Elcombe, C.

While Congress is ultimately in charge of authorizing federal regulatory agency research budgets, government funding has been a small portion of the totality of research dollars being spent on chronic childhood disease. The majority is funded by the food, pharmaceutical, and chemical, as well as special interest Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and professional associations. The following examples illustrate how deep and widespread this influence has become across multiple sectors: The food industry funds the bulk of research in the field. A BMJ analysis found that industry spent over $60 billion on drug, biotechnology, and device research in nutrition science; 70 by comparison, the government spends an estimated $1.5 billion on nutrition research.71 Concerningly, industry-funded nutrition research may bias conclusions in favor of sponsors' products. 72 Government funding for nutrition research through the NIH 64 Jensen, P.

The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON 18\nSection 1. The Shift to Ultra-Processed Foods Following World War 2, much of Europe and Asia's agricultural system was destroyed, and the United States responded by increasing its agricultural output through mechanization, synthetic fertilizers, industrial-scale farming, and shelf-stable processing techniques to feed the world. An outgrowth of this shift in food production and resulting abundant food supply was the increased development of ultra-processed foods, a category of industrially manufactured food products that undergo multiple physical and chemical processing steps and contain ingredients not commonly found in home kitchens. While there is no single, universally accepted definition of UPFs, the term is most commonly associated with the NOVA food classification system, \"industrially manufactured food products made up of several ingredients (formulations) including sugar, oils, fats and salt and food substances of no or rare culinary use.' \"84 Food substances of no culinary use include additives such as flavors, colorants, non-sugar sweeteners, and emulsifiers. Although definitions vary, for the purposes of this assessment, UPFs refer broadly to packaged and ready-to-consume products that are formulated for shelf life and/or palatability but are typically high in added sugars, refined grains, unhealthy fats, and sodium and low in fiber and essential nutrients. Research suggests that the industrial processing required to create UPFS-through additives and nutritional alterations\u2014is a key contributor to their harmful health effects in children. 85 86 Though UPFS may have been created with good intentions for convenience purposes, food safety, and to allow for the ability for longer shelf life and preservation (which was important to ship food around the world), UPF consumption has gone up at an exponential rate as share of the American diet. Today, nearly 70% of an American child's calories come from UPFs, 87 a dramatic change since the 1960s when most food was cooked at home using whole ingredients. It also coincided with significant declines in food prices as a total share of American household income.88 Today, 90% of medical costs in the United States are tied to chronic conditions, 89 many of which are tied to diet.90 The production of UPFs transforms the whole and healthy food produced by America's farmers into food-like substances that have far different nutrient profiles than the original form. Farmers are the backbone of America - and the most innovative and 84 Monteiro CA, Cannon G, Levy RB, et al. Ultra-processed foods: what they are and how to identify them.

The greatest step the United States can take to reverse childhood chronic disease is to put whole foods produced by American farmers and ranchers at the center of healthcare. A Closer Look at Ultra-Processed Foods A growing body of research associates UPFs with negative health outcomes, including in children.9 91 A closer examination of the statistics, particularly over time and in comparison with our global peers, reveals a troubling reality: \u2022 Roughly 70% of the over 300,000 branded food products available in grocery stores today are ultra-processed. 92 93 Over 50% of the calories consumed by Americans come from UPFs, 94 while peer countries like Portugal, Italy, and France average UPF consumption rates of just 10-31%.95 96 97 Meanwhile, over 40% of Americans are obese, 98 compared to less than 25% of the Portuguese,99 Italian, 100 and French populations. 101 Research is beginning to point to three key reasons why UPFS are detrimental to children's health: 1. Nutrient Depletion The rise in UPF consumption has led to the dominance of three key ingredients in American children's diets: ultra-processed grains, sugars, and fats.

Analyzing each of the three ingredients reveals the severity of the nutrient depletion issue: Ultra-Processed Grains: Found in cakes, cookies, refined breads, candy, and snacks, these grains make up a large portion of the UPF calories that dominate daily intake. Processing grains involves the removal of the bran and germ, which strips away essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. The stripping of these components can lead to blood sugar spikes, 103 increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes, 104 while also displacing healthier, nutrient-rich whole grains from the diet. 108 Ultra-Processed Sugars: Found in 75% of packaged foods, 105 the average American consumes 17 teaspoons of added sugars daily, which amounts to 60 pounds annually. 106 This substantial intake, particularly of high fructose corn syrup and other added sugars, may play a significant role in childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 107 Alarmingly, 63% of the U.S. population aged 2 and older derives more than 10% of their daily calories from added sugars.1 Ultra-Processed Fats: Over the course of the 20th century, U.S. dietary fats shifted from minimally processed animal-based sources like butter and lard-rich in fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E, supporting brain and immune health-to industrial fats from refined seed oils, such as soybean, corn, safflower, sunflower, cottonseed, and canola. Industrial refining reduces micronutrients, such as vitamin E and phytosterols. Moreover, these oils contribute to an imbalanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio, a topic of ongoing research for its potential role in inflammation.109 2. Increased Caloric Intake UPFS drive increased caloric intake and weight gain. 110 Industrial processing inherent in UPF production leads to significant changes in fiber, protein, caloric density, and digestibility. Research suggests that these alterations could interfere with brain reward pathways and satiety 102 Wang, L., Steele, E. M., Du, M., Pomeranz, J. L., O'Connor, L. E., Herrick, K. A., & Zhang, F. F.

A 2019 study 114 published in Cell confined 20 adults to an NIH facility, where participants consumed unlimited UPFs for two weeks, followed by two weeks of unlimited unprocessed foods. Despite having identical caloric access, participants consumed roughly 500 fewer calories per day and lost 2 pounds on the unprocessed diet, while they gained 2 pounds on the ultra-processed diet. The researchers observed significantly higher levels of satiety hormones during the unprocessed phase, supporting the idea that UPFs may disrupt hunger signals, promote overeating, and contribute to weight gain. Multiple peer-reviewed studies demonstrate that whole foods, on the other hand, contain built-in satiety mechanisms that help regulate appetite and reduce overeating. Specifically: 115 \u2022 Whole foods rich in dietary fiber stimulate the release of key satiety hormones. A 2016 analysis found that UPFs contributed significantly fewer grams of dietary fiber per calorie compared to minimally processed foods. 11 116 Foods that require more chewing increase oral exposure time, enhancing satiety signals. 117 The texture of whole foods can influence satiety through differences in appetite sensations and gastrointestinal peptide release.1 118 \u2022 Protein is the most effective macronutrient for providing a satiating effect. In addition to stimulating the release of satiety hormones, protein requires more energy to digest than carbohydrates or fats, leading to a higher calorie burn during digestion. 119 3.

The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON 23\nOne notable example of concern around food additives is infant formula. In recent years, some American parents have turned to European formula brands, driven by supply concerns and questions regarding the number and types of additives found in U.S. formulas. 134 Additives in processed foods are consumed in complex combinations, where cumulative and synergistic effects may amplify harm beyond individual components. 135 Yet, testing often ignores these interactions, particularly in children. With dozens of additives consumed daily, these overlooked risks could be significantly impacting children's health. The Impact of Ultra-Processed Foods and the Vital Role of Whole Foods in Children's Health - Human health and biology rely heavily on dietary inputs. During gestation, fetal development depends on maternal nutrition, influencing everything from membrane composition and mitochondrial integrity to nervous system wiring and hormone regulation. This programming ultimately determines the child's long-term metabolic, cognitive, and immune resilience. UPFs make up over 50% of the diets of pregnant and postpartum mothers, 136 despite evidence that increased UPF consumption during pregnancy negatively impacts health outcomes for their children. 137 This trend is mirrored in the wider population, where the rise in UPF consumption poses threats to human health across the lifespan: \u2022 \u2022 \u25cf A recent study published in Nature Medicine estimated that sugar-sweetened beverages alone may be responsible for ~1.2 million new cases of heart disease and 340,000 deaths worldwide in 2020 alone. 138 An umbrella review of 45 meta-analyses published in the BMJ analyzing data from nearly 10 million participants, found that higher consumption of ultra-processed foods is linked to 32 adverse health outcomes, including increased risks of cardiovascular disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, mental health disorders, and all-cause mortality. 139 A study published in JAMA Internal Medicine followed over 44,000 adults and found that every 10% increase in the intake of UPFS was associated with a 14% increased risk of all-cause mortality. 140 This study adjusted for confounding factors like age, sex, physical 134 Szalinski, C.

As the consumption of UPFs has surged, children are increasingly neglecting the whole foods essential for their health. 141 142 Approximately 50% of children ages 2 to 18 skip discrete fruit entirely on any given day. 143 Research consistently shows that key micronutrients such as calcium, iron, potassium, and vitamin D, which are found in fruits and vegetables, are essential for children's physiological functioning.1 144 145 146 Research also consistently links diets centered on whole foods to lower rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, and mental illness. 147 148 This is not surprising. Diet and lifestyle significantly influence gene expression and cellular biology - ultimately determining our health outcomes. 149 150 For instance: \u2022 Leafy greens supply magnesium and folate critical for energy production and other benefits.151 Salmon delivers omega-3 fatty acids that help reduce cardiovascular risk and support brain health. 152 153 \u2022 Legumes offer fiber and resistant starch that help nourish beneficial gut bacteria. 154 155 141 Guthrie, J.

Both UPF reduction and reduced-carbohydrate diets are hypothesized to work by addressing the root cause of these diseases: insulin resistance. 165 While reduced-carbohydrate diets have been studied in several two-year trials, including one with five-year follow-up data, 166 RCTs on UPFs have typically lasted only two weeks, highlighting the critical need for more extensive research, especially with children. The Driving Forces Behind American Children's Food Crisis UPFS are built into the fabric of the post-World War 2 American society and economy. The convenience of \"fast food\" and the food processing and delivery industry that facilitates them is viewed, internationally, as a distinctly \u201cAmerican\u201d innovation. UPFS have allowed us to save money and to \"eat on the run,\u201d but today's over-reliance on UPFs is damaging the health of American children. This crisis results, in large part, from decades of policies that have undermined the food system and perpetuated the delivery of unhealthy food to our children. 156 Souza, A. C. R., Vasconcelos, A.

The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON 26\nConsolidation of the Food System Our agricultural system has historically focused on abundance and affordability. The progress we have made is largely thanks to the hard work of American farmers, ranchers, and food scientists. However, the rise of UPFs has corresponded with a pattern of corporatization and consolidation in our food system. Today's diet-related chronic disease crisis, demand a closer examination of this pattern and its broader impact. Key observations include: \u25cf \u2022 Farmers today receive a small share of consumer food spending; in 2023, only 16 cents of every dollar spent on food went to farmers, while 84 cents was absorbed by food manufacturers, marketers, and distributors. 167 A small number of corporations control a large share of food production, processing, distribution, and retail. Many of the core products of \"Big Food\" companies are UPFS and nutrient-poor foods and beverages. This trend of consolidation began in earnest in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the two largest U.S. tobacco companies transformed into major players in the packaged food industry through aggressive acquisitions. Four companies control 80% of the meat market in the U.S.1 170 168 169 The regulation of the food industry also presents challenges to smaller farmers and smaller food producers. Key regulations, such as the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) enacted in 2011, implemented rigorous compliance requirements for food safety that smaller farms often lack the resources to meet. This has inadvertently led to increased costs and burdensome paperwork that disproportionately impact family-run operations. Similarly, the implementation of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system has further complicated operations for smaller producers without the expertise or capital to navigate such comprehensive safety protocols. 172 171 Distorted Nutrition Research and Marketing The public depends on scientific research and the media for information about the food we consume. The food industry has increasingly influenced these critical sources of public information, diminishing the integrity of information available to consumers: A BMJ analysis found that while industry spent over $60 billion on drug, biotechnology, and medical device research in nutrition science, 173 the government spent $1.5 billion on 167 U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service.

Government funding by the NIH for nutrition research is only 4-5% of its total budget 175 and in some cases can be subjected to influence by food industry-aligned researchers. 176 Industry funding skews the outcomes of nutrition research. In 2018, 13% of articles in the top 10 most cited nutrition journals reported industry involvement, and 56% of these studies yielded favorable results, compared to just 10% of non-industry studies. 177 A meta-analysis further revealed that 0% of interventional nutrition studies funded by the industry reported unfavorable health conclusions regarding soft drinks, juices, and milk, while 37% of studies backed by non-industry funding did; the likelihood of reaching a favorable conclusion in studies that received industry funding was 7.61 times higher compared to studies that did not receive any industry funding. 178 \u2022 According to one study, children are exposed to 15 food ads per day, with over 90% promoting products high in fat, sugar, and sodium. 179 This constant exposure has been linked to increased cravings for and consumption of sugary beverages and other unhealthy products. 180 181 182 Compromised Dietary Guidelines The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) have been the foundation of national nutrition policy. They attempt to shape what millions of Americans eat by influencing programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the National School Lunch Program, and by setting food standards for the military, prisons, and veterans' care. The DGA also influences public health campaigns, nutrition labels, and food industry practices, making them one of the most powerful forces in the U.S. food system. 183,184 174 Toole, A.A. & Kuchler, F.

The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON 28\nWhile the DGA's do emphasize the importance of whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and unsaturated fats as well as recommend limiting added sugars, saturated fats, and excess sodium, 185 they are often presented in technical language that can be difficult for the average person to understand. This complexity may contribute to the worrying statistic that less than 10% of Americans follow a diet that aligns fully with the DGA. 186 Additionally, there are more fundamental criticisms of the DGA's approach that warrant serious consideration. Specifically, the DGA: \u2022 Maintain problematic reductionist recommendations, 187 188 such as: O Advising people to \"reduce saturated fat\u201d or \u201climit sodium\u201d instead of focusing on minimizing ultra-processed foods. \u25cb Treating all calories similarly, rather than distinguishing between nutrient-dense foods and ultra-processed products. Remain largely agnostic to how foods are produced or processed: There is little distinction between industrially processed foods and home-cooked or whole foods if their nutrient profiles look similar. Added sugars, saturated fats and sodium are treated as proxies for ultra-processed foods. For instance, a cup of whole-grain ready to eat fortified breakfast cereal and a cup of oatmeal with fruit might both count as \"whole grain servings,\" and the guidelines do not weigh in on differences in processing. \u2022 Do not explicitly address UPFs: The 2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) under the Biden Administration opted not to issue recommendations limiting UPFs. Although they concluded that a diet higher in UPFS was associated with greater risk of obesity and/or being overweight, they graded the evidence as \u201climited.\u201d189 The DGAC noted methodological discrepancies in existing studies\u2014particularly variations in defining and measuring UPFS-rather than an absence of concern or research rigor. Meanwhile, other countries explicitly urge citizens to avoid or limit UPFs: \u00b0 \u043e Brazil's guidelines explicitly advise people to \u201cavoid ultra-processed foods.\" and emphasize home cooking, shared meals, and cultural food traditions. 190 Japan's guidelines, rooted in traditional dietary culture, emphasize staple foods, side dishes, and moderation, and stress portion variety, food education in schools, and daily physical activity. 19 191 The Nordic countries' guidelines (2023) recommend \u201cminimal intake of...processed foods containing high amounts of added fats, salt, and sugar.' 185 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services & U.S. Department of Agriculture.

France's guidelines encourage cooking from scratch, enjoying minimally processed foods, limiting ultra-processed, high sugar/fat items, and seasonal, local, and organic choices. 193 194 The DGA have a history of being unduly influenced by corporate interests. For example: \u25cf The infamous 1992 Food Pyramid, which was influenced by research from the sugar industry, 195 196 197 recommended carbohydrates at the base of the pyramid and made no differentiation between refined grains and whole grains. \u25cf In 2015, the DGAC recommendation to reduce processed meat consumption faced pushback from the meat production industry, which led to these recommendations being removed from the final published guidelines. 198 \u2022 A recent analysis found that 95% of the 2020DGAC members had some form of relationship with industry actors, most often through research funding but also as board members, speakers/honoraria, or consultants. 199 Government Programs Compounding the Issue Over the past 50 years, several well-intentioned government programs have been launched to improve children's nutrition and access to food. However, as these programs have grown in size and complexity, many have drifted from their original goals: Traditional Field Crops vs. Specialty Crops: Historically, federal crop insurance programs have primarily covered traditional field crops like wheat, corn, and soybeans, while providing much less support for specialty crops such as fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and nursery plants. 200 While specialty crop coverage has been expanding, it still only accounted for 17% of the entire federal crop insurance portfolio by liability during crop year 2017, and subsidies for fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and support for organic foods account for a mere 0.1% of the 2018 Farm Bill. 201 Just over 80% of Farm Bill spending is devoted to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, described further below. 193 Delamaire, C., Escalon, E., & Noirot, L.

Roughly 60% of SNAP participants received Medicaid in 2019, highlighting the connection between healthcare costs and suboptimal nutritional services.212 SNAP currently has incentives in place to encourage increased consumption of fruit, vegetables, dairy, and whole grains. These incentive programs encourage healthy eating by making nutritious food more accessible and affordable through coupons, discounts, gift cards, bonus items, or extra funds. 213 Other countries steer food-assistance recipients toward healthier 202 Food and Nutrition Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.

For example, South Korea and Chile implement food voucher programs similar to SNAP but prioritize domestic and nutritious food products, effectively guiding recipients toward healthier eating habits. 214 215 The School Breakfast Program and National School Lunch Program (NSLP) operates in nearly 100,000 schools covering more than 30 million children,2 216 with an annual cost of $24 billion,2 217 and yet: \u2022 Schools that receive federal lunch subsidies are required to follow a meal pattern that limits added sugars, sodium, and carbohydrates, but do not set limits on UPF consumption, leading to excessive intake of sugar, processed carbohydrates, processed fats, and sodium among children.218 \u2022 To get into schools, many food companies have reformulated their products with minor ingredient adjustments to qualify for the federal Smart Snack program by meeting the school nutrition standards, which children can purchase separate from school meals.2 219 There are concerns that providing these snacks in school can confuse students' perceptions of healthy foods, 220 especially since Smart Snacks are often virtually indistinguishable from less-nutritious versions of fast food products available outside of school.221 While the U.S. has long had programs that both incentivize fruits and vegetables, other countries' school lunch programs have additional standards and guidelines. In France, schools are required to source half their products from local sources and prohibit vending machines. 222 Japanese schools typically prepare meals on-site using whole ingredients, often from local farms and school gardens. 223 Nordic countries, such as Sweden and Finland, have established guidelines that emphasize unprocessed foods while strictly limiting high-fat, high-sugar, and high-sodium processed items. 22 224 225 214 Food insecurity and food assistance programmes across OECD countries: Overcoming evidence gaps (OECD Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Papers No. 183; OECD Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Papers, Vol. 183).

In 1997, President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks, which required federal agencies to make it a high priority to identify and assess environmental health and safety risks that may disproportionately affect children and ensure effective policies, programs, activities, and standards that address them. 232 Environmental health and safety risks were defined as risks to health or to safety that are attributable to products or substances that the child is likely to come in contact with or ingest, such as the air we breathe, the food we eat, the water we drink or use for recreation, the soil we live on, and the products we use or are exposed to. The EO created the President's Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children and the Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics.24 233 234 As depicted by the figure above, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a robust risk-based approach that considers hazard and exposure for assessing the risks of chemicals, including pesticides, to human health and the environment. 232 Executive Order 13045 of April 21, 1997: Protection of children from environmental health risks and safety risks.

The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON 34 ....\nSince 2000, the EPA has been tracking indicators of children's environmental well-being through America's Children and the Environment (ACE). 235 ACE tracks chronic childhood disease in children (e.g., asthma, ADHD, autism, childhood cancers, and obesity) and summarizes trends over time for specific environmental exposures (e.g., air pollutants, drinking water contaminants, and chemicals in food). Many ACE indicators show significant improvements over time\u2014such as exposure to lead which has been reduced over 90% since the 1970s and >70% reduction in key pollutants such as carbon monoxide, ozone, particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide.236 However, in 2025-28 years after EO 13045 was signed-childhood health has largely worsened, and there is a growing concern about the link between environmental health risks, particularly cumulative risks, and chronic disease. Furthermore, in the past nearly 30 years, the chemicals children are exposed to have grown - and no country fully understands how the cumulative impact of this growth impacts health. Exposure Pathways Chemical Classes and Common Exposure Pathways Heavy Metals \u2022 Lead, Mercury Exposure: Legacy paint, pipes, dust Air Pollutants \u2022 CO, O3, Particulate Matter, NO2, SO2, ETC, PAHS \u2022 Exposure: VOCs, smog, wildfires Pesticides Atrazine, Chlorpyrifos, Glyphosate \u2022 Exposure: Food, water, dust, lawn treatment, household. sprays Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals Phthalates, BPA, PBDES \u2022 Exposure: Plastics, personal care products, packaging, textiles, dust Pb PHT Waterborne Contaminants \u2022 PFAS, Nitrates, Fluoride \u2022 Exposure: Drinking water, agricultural runoff Industrial Residues \u2022 Formaldehyde, Cleaning Products, Cosmetics \u2022 Exposure: Home surfaces, building materials, cosmetics, cleaners Persistent Organic Pollutants \u2022 PCBs, Dioxins, PBDES \u2022 Exposure: Dust, food Physical Agents \u26ab EMR; Microplastics \u2022 Exposure: Wi-Fi, mobile phones, 5G; food, water, air It is critical to recognize that chemicals are important tools that are inextricably linked to economic growth and innovations - helping to feed, shelter, and power every American and maintain food safety standards.

The rapid progression of Al technology creates new opportunities to develop tools to better evaluate the environmental exposures of chronic diseases in children. 242 The great challenge of the next decade is for government and industry around the world to understand the impacts of the cumulative chemical exposure that a child faces. This presents an opportunity for American technologic innovation to develop new risk evaluation tools and to promote solutions. The U.S. government is committed to fostering radical transparency and gold-standard science to better understand the potential cumulative impacts of environmental exposures. We must understand and ameliorate any potential links between cumulative chemical exposure and childhood chronic disease. This cannot happen through a European regulatory system that stifles growth. It will happen through a renewed focus on fearless gold-standard science throughout the federal government and through unleashing private sector innovation to understand and reduce the cumulative chemical load on our children. It is critical the U.S. evaluate the current environmental regulatory structure and determine ways to continue to promote economic growth through innovation, while also evolving our frameworks for promoting children's health. Children Are Why Chemicals Are Uniquely Vulnerable to Environmental Children are not \u201clittle adults\u201d when it comes to environmental chemicals. 243 Exposure to these substances can begin at conception and continue throughout childhood, adolescence, and into adulthood, accumulating over time. The placenta and umbilical cord do not serve as impenetrable barriers; they can allow hundreds of industrial chemicals and pollutants to reach the developing fetus. 244 Once children are exposed to these substances, several unique characteristics make newborns, children, and adolescents particularly vulnerable. Here are some key factors that heighten their risk: 237 Elcombe, C. S., Evans, Neil P. & and Bellingham, M.

In Utero (Prenatal Exposure) . Chemicals can pass through the placental barrier. \u2022 Toxicants\u2014such as heavy metals, pesticides, and industrial pollutants\u2014have been detected in cord blood and amniotic fluid. \u2022 Rapidly dividing fetal cells are highly sensitive; timing of exposure is often as important as dose. Infancy and Early Childhood \u2022 Babies' underdeveloped detox systems allow toxicants to accumulate. \u2022 Breast milk can also transfer fat-soluble toxicants. \u2022 Behaviors like crawling and playing increase exposure to contaminants. \u2022 As the brain forms neural connections, chemical exposures can produce lasting learning, behavioral, or immune issues. Adolescence (Puberty) \u2022 \u2022 Exposures can have lasting consequences on endocrine and neurological development during puberty. Hormonal changes can be disrupted by chemicals that interfere with endocrine signaling. \u2022 The immature adolescent brain undergoes rapid changes; neurotoxic exposure may have unique impacts on cognitive and mental health development. While children are uniquely vulnerable, they are also exposed to hazardous substances in different ways: Virtually every breastmilk sample (important for infant health, growth, and development) tested in America contains some level of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including pesticides, microplastics, and dioxins. 25 259 260 Breastfeeding is the top recommendation for infant nutrition but the data indicates the pervasiveness of the exposures in American life. 259 LaKind, J.

Though findings that show risk often contrast with findings that show minimal, if any, risk, this still demonstrates the need for continued studies from the public and private sectors, especially the NIH, to better understand the cumulative load of multiple exposures and how it may impact children's health, including exposures from: \u2022 \u2022 PFAS: a large group of more than 12,000 distinct synthetic chemicals widely used for water-, oil-, and stain-resistance in products, such as nonstick cookware, food packaging, textiles, cosmetics, and firefighting foam. 275 According to a recent review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, 276 high levels of certain types of PFAS exposure has been associated with a variety of health effects, including immune suppression and, changes in cholesterol in children. Announced in May 2025, EPA will implement national enforceable drinking water standards for two PFAS compounds in drinking water and consider regulatory determinations for another four PFAS compounds, in line with a new agency-wide strategy. Microplastics: plastic fragments less than 5 millimeters in size used frequently in products such as clothing, medicine, and shower gels. 277 One single-site study in 2025 showed that the concentration found in Americans' brain tissue increased by 50% between 2016 and 2024.278 Some studies have additionally found that microplastics often carry endocrine-disrupting chemicals that interfere with hormonal development and potentially trigger early puberty\u2014especially in girls-and heighten the risks of obesity, infertility, and hormone-related cancers. 279 280 281 Fluoride: an inorganic salt first added to water in 1945 to combat cavities. 282 By 2022, over 60% of Americans\u2014more than 70% of those on Community Water Systems\u2014were 273 Roberts, J.

Some studies have raised concerns about possible links between some of these products and adverse health outcomes, especially in children, but human studies are limited. 299 300 301 For example, a selection of research studies on a herbicide (glyphosate) have noted a range of possible health effects, ranging from reproductive and developmental disorders as well as cancers, liver inflammation and metabolic disturbances. 302 304 305 In experimental animal and wildlife studies, exposure to another herbicide (atrazine) can cause endocrine disruption and birth defects. 306 Common exposures include lawn care, farming, and pesticide residues; however, a large-scale FDA study of pesticide residues (2009-2017) found the majority of samples (>90%) were compliant with federal standards. 307 More recent data from the USDA's Pesticide Data Program found that 99% of food samples tested in 2023 were compliant with EPA's safety limit. 30 308 Federal government reviews of epidemiologic data for the most common herbicide did not establish a direct link between use according to label directions and adverse health outcomes, and an updated U.S. government health assessment on common herbicides is expected in 2026. 295 Braun JM, Hauser R.

The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON 42\nImportantly, the Executive Order establishing the MAHA Commission directed the involved agencies to work with farmers to ensure that United States food is the healthiest, most abundant, and most affordable in the world. American farmers are critical partners in the success of the Make America Healthy Again agenda. All the involved agencies are therefore committed to ensuring not just the survival, but the prosperity, of American Farmers. American farmers rely on these products, and actions that further regulate or restrict crop protection tools beyond risk-based and scientific processes set forth by Congress must involve thoughtful consideration of what is necessary for adequate protection, alternatives, and cost of production. Precipitous changes in agricultural practices could have an adverse impact on American agriculture and the domestic and global food supply. The federal government will continue to regularly review the safety of these important crop protection tools. Corporate Influence Scientific Research A significant portion of environmental toxicology and epidemiology studies are conducted by private corporations. 309 Reports in 2023 indicate that the largest pesticide manufacturers spent billions on research initiatives. 310 311 312 313 Limited comparisons between industry-funded research versus non-industry studies have raised concerns over potential biases in industry-funded research. These disparities are potentially due to bias in study design and reporting, along with publication bias favoring positive findings in academic research. 314 315 Such biases amplify potential discrepancies in the literature and limit the scientific publication of unfavorable results: An analysis of a common pesticide found that 50% of non-industry research found it harmful, compared to 18% of industry-funded studies, which also reported fewer significant adverse results (9% vs. 33%). 316 309 Bero, L., Anglemyer, A., Vesterinen, H. & Krauth, D.

Secondary analysis of approximately 2,500 \u201chigh production volume\u201d chemicals suggests that further toxicological studies may be necessary to ensure adequate understanding of their potential health effects. 320 321 322 Additionally, some industry leaders have engaged in promoting ghostwriting and sponsored reviews to influence the scientific literature. Notably, this ghostwriting strategy mirrors tactics used by the tobacco industry to distort scientific consensus.3 Laws and Regulations 323 Corporate influence stretches beyond extensive involvement in scientific research to include active governmental lobbying: \u2022 In 2024, the chemical-manufacturing lobby spent roughly $77 million on federal influence activities placing the industry among Washington's top spenders.\u00b3 324 In 2023, 60% of chemical-sector lobbyists previously held federal posts. 325 As a result of this influence, the regulatory environment surrounding the chemical industry may reflect a consideration of its interests. For example, more than ten thousand chemicals listed on EPA's inventory are designated as confidential and generic chemical names are used to identify them. 317 Vom Saal, F. S., & Vandenberg, L. N.

The Crisis of Childhood Behavior in the Digital Age Over the past four decades, American children have transitioned from an active, play-based childhood to a sedentary, technology-driven lifestyle, contributing to increases in chronic physical and mental health disease. Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist and co-author of The Anxious Generation, terms this shift the \"Great Rewiring of Childhood,\" driven by increased screen time, reduced physical activity, and psychosocial stressors such as loneliness, chronic stress, and sleep deprivation.\u00b3 326 The Decline of Physical Activity Physical activity, encompassing moderate-to-vigorous exercise, aerobic fitness, and reduced sedentary time, is critical for child health and well-being. 327 However, American youth have seen a steady decline in activity and cardiorespiratory fitness over decades, contributing to rising obesity, diabetes, mental health disorders, and cardiometabolic risks. 328 329 330 Studies show: . Aerobic Fitness Among U.S. Children Has Declined: U.S. children experienced a significant decline in aerobic fitness for decades; an international study ranked the aerobic fitness of U.S. children 47th out of 50.331 332 A 2020 Scientific Statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) reported that nearly 60% of American children (specifically 12- to 15-year-olds) do not have healthy cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). 33 Very Few Children Meet Daily Physical Activity Recommendations: More than 70% of children aged 6-17 (rising to 85% in teens) did not meet the 2024 federal minimum recommendation of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.3 334 326 Haidt, J.

This is marked by rising mental health disorders, significant sleep deficits, chronic stress, and pervasive loneliness, all exacerbated by the widespread influence of technology. The crisis persists despite rising therapy rates, with some suggesting it may exacerbate issues. 335 National Center for Safe Routes to School. (2011).

The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON 46\nDeclining Sleep Sleep is foundational to health, essential for children's physical, mental, and cognitive development. Yet, American children, particularly adolescents, face a nationwide sleep crisis, with up to 75% of 17-18-year-olds reporting inadequate sleep and 95% of 12th graders getting less than recommended sleep time. 347 348 While specific data before 2000 is limited, sleep duration has likely declined since the 1960s, driven by societal shifts like increased screen use and academic pressure. 349 350 351 Circadian rhythms, regulated by sunlight and disrupted by artificial light, play a critical role in sleep health. Morning sunlight synchronizes the body's internal clock, boosting mood and metabolism, while nighttime light exposure, affecting 99% of Americans due to widespread light pollution, suppresses melatonin production and increases risks of metabolic disorders. 352 353 354 \u2022 High School Students: In 2021, 78% of U.S. high school students reported sleeping less than the recommended 8 hours per night on school nights, a rise from 69% in 2009. This trend disproportionately impacted female students (81%) and 12th graders (83%). 35 356 \u2022 Younger Children: In 2020-2021, 35% of children aged 4 months to 14 years had inadequate sleep. 357 \u2022 Light Exposure: Natural sunlight can reach up to 100,000 lux, significantly brighter than typical indoor lighting (100-300 lux), yet individuals, including children, typically receive only 1-2 hours daily in environments exceeding 1,000 lux. 358 Additionally, 36% of parents, according to one study, report leaving electronic devices powered on in their children's bedrooms at night, contributing to sleep disruption through blue light exposure.359 347 Basch, C.

Chronic Stress 362 363 Chronic stress among youth has surged, particularly since 2010, with mental distress scores rising sharply in 2022.36 365 366 Stress has become pervasive, with roughly 50% of Americans reporting frequent stress, a 16% increase over the past two decades. Stress levels have likely increased since the 1980s due to growing academic and social pressures. 367 \u2022 Prevalence: In 2021, the CDC reported that 42% of U.S. high school students experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, up from 28% in 2011.368 Female students faced disproportionate impacts, with 57% reporting persistent sadness or hopelessness and a 58% increase in suicidal ideation from approximately 19% in 2011 to 30% in 2021.369 Approximately 20-25% of adolescents reported anxiety symptoms and 15-20% reported depressive symptoms, with girls showing significantly higher rates. 370 360 Spiegel, K., Leproult, R., & Van Cauter, E.

The UK's Tackling Loneliness Strategy highlights global parallels, emphasizing loneliness as a public health crisis with profound impacts on youth well-being.374 For American children, this reflects a loss of community and play, compounding mental and physical health risks: \u25cf Prevalence in young people: Over three in five Americans feel lonely, a 13% increase since 2018, with 73% of 16-24-year-olds reporting loneliness, a trend worsening since the 1970s. Young men are particularly affected, with 15% reporting no close friendships, a fivefold increase since 1990.375 376 Prevalence in children: Approximately 20% of U.S. children aged 6-11 experience social difficulties indicative of loneliness, such as trouble making or keeping friends, a condition exacerbated by reduced unstructured play. 377 Health Risks: Loneliness in children is associated with increased risks of depression and anxiety, posing significant health challenges. 378 379 380 Technology's Systemic Impact Since 2010, smartphones, social media, and gaming have reshaped childhood, and have likely helped to drive mental health declines through social deprivation, sleep disruption, attention fragmentation, and addiction. 381 American youth are increasingly tethered to digital devices, displacing physical activity and in-person interactions. 371 Liu, W., Zhang, Y., & Li, H.

In 2021, teens aged 13-18 averaged approximately 8 hours and 39 minutes of non-school screen time daily. 3 382 383 The Negative Impact of Social Media on Children's Mental Health The near-ubiquitous presence of social media in the lives of American adolescents, with up to 95% of teens regularly using at least one or more of these platforms 38 384 is increasingly correlated with a concerning rise in mental health challenges, particularly among younger users. With the vast majority of teenagers engaging with these platforms, understanding the nuanced consequences and mental health impacts of social media on their developing well-being is of critical public health importance: High Usage and Mental Health Risks: Adolescents spending more than three hours per day on these platforms may be at heightened risks of mental health issues such as anxiety and depression compared to their peers with lower usage.\u00b3 385 Dose-Response Relationship: A 2022 meta-analysis of studies on adolescents found that each additional hour spent daily on social media was associated with a 13% increase in the risk of depressive symptoms, with adolescent girls showing higher associations than boys. 3 386 Internal Industry Findings: A social media company's internal findings documented its platform's negative effects on young users, including: worsening body image issues in one in three teenage girls; links drawn by teen users between the platform and suicidal thoughts; one in five teens reporting the platform made them feel worse about themselves; aggravation of existing mental health conditions in struggling teens. 387 Emotional Distress: A randomized controlled trial involving youth with emotional distress demonstrated that limiting social media use to one hour per day resulted in statistically significant reductions in self-reported depression, anxiety, and fear of missing out (FOMO). 388 Another randomized controlled trial where participants deactivated their social media accounts for four weeks found statistically significant improvements in subjective well-being, including increased happiness and life satisfaction, and reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety. 3 389 382 Common Sense Media.

The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON 50\nCorporate Influence on Children's Social Media Use Technology corporations suggest a reach over childhood health that stretches well beyond the direct harms of screen exposure, actively shaping the contours of scientific discourse and the public-health policies that follow. The pervasive influence of major technology firms on the digital environment of children has prompted significant scrutiny, particularly regarding the alignment of corporate practices with child protection frameworks and the erosion of parental oversight: \u2022 Content Control and Censorship: During COVID-19, the tech platforms became quasi-public utilities for health messaging. Court records and Congressional research show federal agencies urged-or in some cases pressed-platforms to suppress content questioning pediatric vaccine-risk profiles or school-closure policies. 390 391 Dark-pattern purchases: An FTC settlement found a leading game platform used in-app flows that let minors carry out purchases and surrender data \u201cwithout any parental involvement.\" \" 392 These informal, largely invisible coordination between agencies and platforms\u2014coupled with undisclosed ranking algorithms-compresses the range of permissible debate on childhood-health questions and can bury legitimate scientific concerns while impacting parental supervision. Recognizing this hidden architecture is a crucial step toward improving childhood health and restoring transparency in the digital age. Family Dynamics and Socio Economics . Frequent family meals are associated with teens having lower rates of disordered eating, alcohol and substance use, violent behavior, and feelings of depression or thoughts of suicide in adolescents. 35 393 Single-family homes are associated with worse mental health outcomes in teens: 39 Double the rate of internalizing disorders (i.e. Anxiety & Depression). \u043e \u041e Triple the rates of externalizing disorders (i.e. ADHD, conduct disorder). The single-family home rate in the U.S. has increased from 9% in 1960 to 28% in 2012.3 395 Children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are two to three times more likely to develop mental health issues.396 390 State of Missouri v.

Parents have reported decreased ADHD symptoms after their children participated in activities in green areas compared to non-green areas. 399 400 In a controlled experiment, children with ADHD who took a walk in a park showed improved attention performance, compared to those who walked in urban setting.401 Balancing the Paradox: Overdiagnosis, Genuine Distress, and Intervention Risks Children's mental health in America presents a paradox for clinicians and policymakers: overdiagnosis of conditions like ADHD, depression, and anxiety coexists with a genuine rise in distress. This tension, driven by factors like screen time, social isolation, and academic pressure discussed earlier, complicates efforts to address youth mental health effectively. Data confirms a real rise in youth mental health struggles. National surveys report that the number of adolescents experiencing persistent sadness or hopelessness increased from 28% in 2011 to 42% in 2021.402 Suicide rates for ages 10-24 rose 62% from 2007 to 2021, after remaining stable from 2001 to 2007,403 and emergency department visits for self-harm among ages 10-14 surged 63% from 2009 to 2018.404 Yet, overdiagnosis remains a significant concern. Research shows ADHD has the strongest evidence of overdiagnosis, with studies noting that for youth with milder symptoms, \u201cthe harms associated with an ADHD diagnosis may often outweigh the benefits.\u201d405 Schools, eager to \"fix kids\" by addressing behavioural challenges, may inadvertently contribute to this trend by encouraging diagnoses to access support, potentially mislabelling typical developmental behaviours as disorders. Similar concerns exist for depression and anxiety, where overdiagnosis 397 Louv, R. (2005). Last child in the woods: Saving our children from nature-deficit disorder.

Some interventions may even cause harm. For example, universal school-based mental health programs can inadvertently increase distress in certain adolescents by encouraging rumination, though evidence is debated.408 Such over-pathologization may lead to interventions that fail to address root causes. Echoing these concerns, Abigail Shrier's 2024 book, Bad Therapy: Why the Kids aren't Growing Up, 40 contends that interventions like therapy and Social-Emotional Learning programs may weaken resilience by pathologizing normal emotions. This perspective raises concerns that practices like trauma-informed care and gentle parenting potentially pathologize normal emotions, undermine resilience, and contribute to rising anxiety and depression rates among children and teenagers. Though controversial and disputed by many experts, this perspective remains viable and warrants rigorous scientific investigation to either confirm or refute its validity. 406 Merten, E.C., Cwik, J.C., Margraf, J., & Schneider, S.

The Overmedicalization of Our Kids Medical overuse in children typically occurs by well-intended physicians and parents attempting to help a child. It has been estimated that roughly one-third of healthcare spending in the United States is wasteful and does not improve patient health. 410 American healthcare operates in a marketplace where incentives, when misaligned, can foster and encourage overuse by allowing stakeholders to maximize profits at the expense of consumer health and wellbeing. In recent decades, American children have, as a product of these misaligned incentives, been subject to an unprecedented period of over-prescription driven, in large part, by corporate influence, with demonstrable consequences for their health. The information below offers an assessment of how the medical system may be exacerbating the chronic disease epidemic in children and is summarized from the published scientific literature. American Children are on Too Much Medicine-A Recent and Emerging Crisis One in five U.S. children are estimated to have taken at least one prescription medication in the past 30 days, with ongoing use most pronounced among adolescents, among whom 27% take one or more daily prescription drugs. 411 Time trends suggest the current breadth of prescription drug exposure in US children is of relatively recent origin: \u2022 Stimulant prescriptions, drugs used to treat ADHD in the US, doubled from 2006-2016;412 by 2022 11% of children had an ADHD diagnosis, with boys having a rate of nearly 1 in 4 by age 17.413 Antidepressant prescriptions were written for greater than 2 million adolescents in 2022,414 a 1400% increase from 1987-2014.41 415 \u2022 Antipsychotic use in US kids rose 800% 1995-2009, 66% of which was off-label for issues like ADHD or \"aggression.\u201d416 \u2022 Antibiotics for outpatient children reached 49 million in 2022.417 It has been estimated that about 35% are unnecessary, suggesting every year about 15 million children are prescribed unnecessary antibiotics, offering only risk with no chance of benefit. 418 410 McGinnis, J.

Psychotropics for ADHD are one example, prescribed 2.5 times more in US than in British children 423, and 19 times more than in Japanese youth. 424 425 The crisis of overdiagnosis and overtreatment in children is therefore both empirically evident, and proportionally specific to American youth. While excessive medical intervention in the US healthcare system is broadly recognized, 426 there has been less attention given to direct harms experienced by Americans due to overtreatment. Despite this there exists a robust evidence base demonstrating significant and costly (both financially and in terms of human suffering) harms experienced by children due to overtreatment at the hands of American healthcare. Of note, as this report lists representative examples of demonstrably harmful practices in children, many will depend on readers' understanding of a core principle of evidence-based medicine: interventions shown to offer no benefit when compared to placebo are harmful. All medical interventions involve some risk of biological adverse effects, as well as cost, resource investment, opportunity cost, and human capital. From an evidence-based standpoint, these harms are the only potential impact when using interventions proven to have no benefit. Therefore, in some of the examples given below, the net harmfulness of a listed example is understood by virtue of the proven absence of a benefit, that is frequently learned when an undertested, but commonly used, intervention is properly evaluated in a randomized controlled trial, which is the gold standard of evidence in medicine. Examples of proven harms due to overtreatment include: \u2022 Psychiatric drugs, commonly used in children are known to cause serious, and often dangerous, short term adverse effects, such as, seizures, manic episodes, QT prolongation, discontinuation withdrawal syndrome as listed on FDA labels. 427 419 https://www.meps.ahrq.gov/data_files/publications/st341/stat341.shtml. 420 Farber, H.

The above examples represent harms that have been carefully studied and thus well proven. However, in the setting of childhood growth and development there remains an important likelihood of undetected but potentially major long-term repercussions. Established harms in children may therefore be thought of as the tip of a potentially vast iceberg representing both detectable short term negative effects, and potentially hidden negative effects with long term implications. While long term research on the developmental and adult-stage impact of most commonly used drugs for children is limited, there are contributory human data that raise important questions. Examples include: SSRIS: Used to treat depression and anxiety, SSRIs carry a black box warning 442 due to established incidents of suicidal thinking and behavior caused by the drugs in adolescents-such incidents are difficult to separate from progression of baseline disease and therefore may go largely undetected. .443 Stimulants: According to best trial data available, these widely used ADHD drugs cause long-term height loss averaging an inch;44 of note, the only long-term trial found exclusively short-term (14-month) behavior benefits, which were not found at 3 years.444 Indeed, at 3, 5, 8, and 14 years, no benefits were seen in grades, relationships, achievement, behavior, or any other measure. \u2022 GLP-1 Agonists: Increasingly common, ,445 these popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs with complicated metabolic effects lack neurodevelopmental and other long term safety data, raising the specter of unforeseen problems that interrupt, damage, or impair metabolism and growth development. \u2022 Child Chemical and Surgical Mutilation carries major risks related to puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries, including irreversible effects like infertility. 446 The AMA 447 and AAP 448 recommend these medications and procedures, however, despite an 440 Powers, S.

In many settings of pediatric care authorities, guidelines, and healthcare providers rely largely on dosing and safety profiles from adult studies. 453 Growth of the Childhood Vaccine Schedule The Executive Order establishing the MAHA Commission directed the study of any potential contributing causes to the childhood chronic disease crisis, including medical treatments, and to \"assess the threat that potential over-utilization of medication... pose[s] to children with respect to chronic inflammation or other established mechanisms of disease, using rigorous and transparent data, including international comparisons.\" Vaccines benefit children by protecting them from infectious diseases. But, as with any medicine, vaccines can have side effects that must be balanced against their benefits. Parents should be fully informed of the benefits and risks of vaccines. Many of them have concerns about the appropriate use of vaccines and their possible role in the growing childhood chronic disease crisis. Since 1986, for the average child, by one year of age, the number of recommended vaccines on the CDC childhood schedule has increased from 3 injections to 29 injections (including in utero exposures from vaccines administered to the mother).

These areas warrant future inquiry: Clinical trials: Our understanding of vaccine safety and any links to chronic disease would benefit from more rigorous clinical trial designs,4 ,462 463 including the use of true placebos, larger sample sizes, and longer follow-up periods.

Many health care professionals do not report to VAERS because they are not mandated to do so or they may not connect the adverse event to a vaccination. 468 469 The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) system, established in 1990, works with healthcare organizations to monitor and study adverse events using electronic health records, covering 15 million people.47 470 471 However, deidentified data in the VSD, paid for by taxpayers, is not generally available to scientists outside of the VSD network to conduct analyses or replicate findings using VSD data. Furthermore, the CDC has noted that VSD studies are likely prone to confounders and bias; it is also geared towards studying short-term outcomes and is not well-suited to studying associations between vaccination and longer-term chronic disease conditions.4 472 Conflicts of interest: The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 was enacted in response to liability concerns surrounding injuries linked to the three routine childhood vaccines in use at the time. 473 The law shields vaccine manufacturers from liability for vaccine-related injuries, creating a unique regulatory and legal framework. This framework creates financial disincentives for pharmaceutical companies to identify safety issues either pre- or post-licensure. Congress made HHS responsible for vaccine safety in the Mandate for Safer Childhood Vaccines.4 However, HHS also has the conflicting duty to promote vaccines and to defend them against claims of injury in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.475 In fact, HHS has faced lawsuits for failing to fulfill basic duties under the Mandate for Safer 474 464 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration.

The American Medical Association (AMA), for example, adopted a new policy aimed at \"addressing public health disinformation\" that called to \"ensure licensing boards have the authority to take disciplinary action against health professionals for spreading health-related disinformation.\" This dynamic discourages practitioners from conducting or discussing nuanced risk-benefit analyses that deviate from guidelines even when those analyses may be clinically appropriate. It also discourages physicians and scientists from studying adverse reactions. This silences critical discussion, discourages reporting to safety systems and hampers vaccine research, and undermines the open dialogue essential to protecting and improving children's health. \"478 official 476 https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/117456/witnesses/HHRG-118-JU05-Wstate-SiriEsqA-20240626.pdf. 477 Elisha, E., Guetzkow, J., Shir-Raz, Y., & Ronel, N.

The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON 61\nFrom Bench to Bedside: Mechanisms of Corporate Capture The overmedicalization of American children, characterized by escalating prescription rates, unwarranted interventions, and declining health outcomes, signals a critical policy failure where corporate profitability supersedes the health of children. While in the 1960s U.S. healthcare achieved excellent health outcomes for children while spending at a level consistent with other developed nations, today's system far outspends sister nations while delivering far worse outcomes. This phenomenon is largely propelled by \"corporate capture,\" in which industry interests dominate and distort scientific literature, legislative actions, academic institutions, regulatory agencies, medical journals, physician organizations, clinical guidelines, and the news media. The pharmaceutical industry, with its vast resources and influence, is a primary driver of this capture, though similar dynamics pervade the food and chemical industries, further exacerbating health challenges. This analysis details the mechanisms of corporate capture through a \"bench to bedside\" framework, followed by an examination of the systemic frailties that perpetuate industry dominance. At a granular level, this suggests the poor health and increased morbidity of our children is multifactorial and includes, most prominently, the corporate capture of medical knowledge. The distortion and influence of medical education, medical knowledge, and therefore clinical guidelines and practice, has led providers to over-diagnose and over-prescribe, and over-use by children, while largely ignoring the potential population-level impact of diet, lifestyle, and environment as focal points for health, healing, and wellness. Corporate capture entails the systematic distortion of scientific literature, regulatory processes, clinical practices, and public discourse by pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, all aimed at maximizing profits. These mechanisms illustrate a trajectory from initial research to pervasive market saturation and narrative control. 1. Distorting Scientific Literature In medical school, doctors are taught high quality care is based on the scientific evidence presented in peer reviewed articles published in reputable medical journals. Embedded in this dictum are several assumptions: That medical research is broadly focused on the most common and serious health challenges. \u2022 That journal articles include the most relevant findings on benefits and harms. That the publication of articles in reputable journals is tantamount to an attestation and confirmation that the reports are faithfully distilled representations of original study data. That peer reviewers are unbiased and have the biomedical, analytic, and scientific expertise to filter and curate study reports, assuring they are methodologically valid, presented fairly, and interpreted correctly. The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON 62\nThese assumptions are often incorrect In the United States, private industry funds five times as many clinical trials than all U.S. Federal agencies combined including the NIH. 479 Since 1999, 97% of the most frequently cited clinical trials received funding from industry 480 The number of citations is a measure of papers' impact, 48 suggesting nearly all of the most impactful clinical trials have been funded by industry. 481 \u2022 Medical journals often do not have access to patient-level data from pharmaceutical research and therefore cannot vouch for the accuracy or completeness of the data they see. Industry data is firewalled, and companies generally allow no one other than employees to see it 482-doctors and patients must therefore rely on the good faith of corporations to present an honest picture of their research. \u25cf Peer review, the gatekeeping attribute that defines medical journals, is ineffective and biased; reviewers at top journals are untrained, 483 ineffective when tested, 484 and many have financial ties to drug companies.485 Drug companies, therefore, exercise corporate control over the research agenda, corporate control of the research findings seen by patients and doctors, and corporate influence over the review of those findings. These are the structural components comprising the corporate capture of medical information. Despite the broad inability of scientists or journalists to obtain access to original research data from pharmaceutical companies, there is an overwhelming body of scientific evidence supporting the conclusion that pharmaceutical industry dominance of research leads to distorted and misleading information routinely published in top journals, while journals and their content are routinely manipulated and controlled by industry money: \u2022 Pharmaceutical companies often craft studies and papers designed to favor their products. Evidence shows industry studies are much more likely to report favorable outcomes, 486 exaggerating benefits and underreporting harms. 48 487 Editorials and opinion pieces in top journals are often written by biased, industry funded authors, and therefore disproportionately conclude the drugs in question are safe and effective.488 479 Ehrhardt, S., Appel, L.

The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON 63\nMedical journal economics: Medical journals rely for profitability on revenue from industry (advertising and reprints), thus journals reap handsome profits when publishing successful studies of drugs. 48 489 \u2022 More than half of top medical journal editors have been paid directly by drug companies, often as funding for research; though most payments were modest there were two notable outliers who received general payments of greater than $1M in 2014.490 \u2022 Despite incentives to favor industry, some of the world's most respected medical journal editors have publicly expressed disgust and loathing for industry's impact on the content and nature of medical journals, including:49 \u041e \u25cb \u041e .491 Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet: \u201cJournals have devolved into information laundering operations for the pharmaceutical industry.\" Marcia Angell, former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine: Criticized industry for becoming \u201cprimarily a marketing machine\" and co-opting \u201cevery institution that might stand in its way.\" Richard Smith, former editor of the BMJ: \"Medical journals are an extension of the marketing arm of pharmaceutical companies.\u201d Arnold Relman, former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine: \"The medical profession is being bought by the pharmaceutical industry, not only in terms of the practice of medicine, but also in terms of teaching and research. The academic institutions of this country are allowing themselves to be paid agents of the pharmaceutical industry. I think it's disgraceful.\" One of the world's most prestigious journals published an article critiquing pharmaceutical advertisements, and lost an estimated $1-1.5 million in advertising revenue, revealing \"the true colors of the pharmaceutical industry, which was willing to flex its considerable muscles when it felt its interests were threatened.\"492 2. Exerting Potentially Undue Influence Evidence suggests that pharmaceutical money strongly influences congressional legislation through lobbying and the manipulation of patient advocacy groups, and exerts considerable financial control over the FDA and its employees: \u2022 From 1999 to 2018, the pharmaceutical industry spent $4.7 billion on lobbying expenditures at the federal level, more than any other industry. 493 \u2022 Industry-funded patient advocacy groups often present as independent entities, pressuring regulatory bodies to prioritize rapid access to new treatments over safety. 49 489 Lexchin J, Light DW.

Widening Markets and Influencing Clinical Practice The pharmaceutical, device, and related healthcare industries have used a broad range of tactics to maximize profits, many of them explicitly untethered to improvements in child health. Such tactics typically have the impact of distorting and widening markets for industry product sales. Examples include: \u2022 In prior studies, 80% of clinical departments at U.S. medical schools and teaching hospitals are funded directly by the pharmaceutical industry.498 \u2022 Industry sponsorship of education for medical students and physicians typically promotes drugs, encourages off-label prescribing, and contributes to polypharmacy in kids.499 \u25cf Half of Continuing Medical Education courses in the U.S. are funded by the pharmaceutical industry.500 Studies find sponsored courses profoundly impact physician behavior, increasing prescribing of the sponsor's drug;501 industry studies show the return on investment for this averages $3.56 for every dollar spent. 502 Industry donations to the CDC Foundation are believed to influence federal public health campaigns, highlighting \"awareness\u201d of selected child conditions to justify more diagnosis and drug use. 503 The CDC foundation openly advertises that \"you can advance CDC's work on a specific health threat by supporting a CDC foundation program\" and have \"the ability to target investments where most needed.\u201d504 Such conflicts of interest may have influenced CDC work, related to hepatitis C screening and chronic kidney disease, as noted in a BMJ investigation. 505 Clinical guidelines written by respected professional societies and organizations provide a particularly powerful and potentially amplified influence target for industry. Studies suggests there is considerable funding and effort in this direction, with notable consequences. Examples include: 495 Pradhan R, (2025).

The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON 65\n\u25cb Studies have found the majority of clinical guideline panelists in the US have \u25cb financial ties to pharmaceutical or device companies. 506 The American Diabetes Association's (ADA) type 2 diabetes guideline, with 94% of authors reporting conflicts, recommends aggressive glucose control through drugs; research indicates this may often worsen outcomes. 507 The ADA guideline also recommends treating \u201cprediabetes\" with drugs despite limited evidence of long-term benefits, 508 consistent with marketing of \"conditions\" like pre-hypertension and pre-hyperlipidemia. The majority of the panelists who composed the DSM-5 were found to have conflicts of interest 509 and their recommendations loosened criteria for ADHD and bipolar disorder, driving a 40-fold increase in diagnoses in children 1994-2003,51 with a rise in prescriptions for antipsychotics and stimulants.511 Pharmaceutical companies have settled with U.S. government, including for major settlements of $430 million, 512 $2.2 billion, 513 and $3 billion.514 4. Influencing Media, Disincentivizing Public Criticism The corporate capture of media, primarily through lavish advertising campaigns that are uniquely targeted to American consumers (no other developed country allows direct advertising of drugs to consumers, other than New Zealand where such advertising is heavily regulated and federally controlled) 515 confers a notable level of reliance on the industry by those that benefit financially. While in the U.S. the pharmaceutical industry has the First Amendment right to have these advertisements, studies suggest that they have a strong influence on those who view them, potentially increasing inappropriate prescriptions. 506 Neuman, J., Korenstein, D., Ross, J.

The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON 67\nNext Steps \u2013 Supporting Gold-Standard Scientific Research and Developing a Comprehensive Strategy To close critical research gaps and guide efforts to better combat childhood chronic disease in America, the following research initiatives are recommended: 1. Addressing the Replication Crisis: NIH should launch a coordinated initiative to confront the replication crisis, investing in reproducibility efforts to improve trust and reliability in basic science and interventions for childhood chronic disease. 2. Post-Marketing Surveillance: NIH and FDA should build systems for real-world safety monitoring of pediatric drugs and create programs to independently replicate findings from industry-funded studies. 3. Real-World Data Platform: Expand the NIH-CMS autism data initiative into a broader, secure system linking claims, EHRs, and environmental inputs to study childhood chronic diseases. 4. Al-Powered Surveillance: Create a task force to apply Al and machine learning to federal health and nutrition datasets for early detection of harmful exposures and childhood chronic disease trends. 5. GRAS Oversight Reform: Fund independent studies evaluating the health impact of self-affirmed GRAS food ingredients, prioritizing risks to children and informing transparent FDA rulemaking. 6. Nutrition Trials: NIH should fund long-term trials comparing whole-food, reduced-carb, and low-UPF diets in children to assess effects on obesity and insulin resistance. 7. Large-scale Lifestyle Interventions: Launch a coordinated national lifestyle-medicine initiative that embeds real-world randomized trials-covering integrated interventions in movement, diet, light exposure, and sleep timing-within existing cohorts and EHR networks. 8. Drug Safety Research: Support studies on long-term neurodevelopmental and metabolic outcomes of commonly prescribed pediatric drugs, emphasizing real-world settings and meaningful endpoints. 9. Alternative Testing Models: Invest in New Approach Methodologies (NAMs), such as organ-on-a-chip, microphysiological systems, and computational biology, to complement animal testing with more predictive human-relevant models. 10. Precision Toxicology: Launch a national initiative to map gene-environment interactions affecting childhood disease risk, especially for pollutants, endocrine disruptors, and pharmaceuticals. Some of the steps to implement these research initiatives are already underway and others will begin this in the near future. In parallel, the MAHA Commission will immediately begin working on developing the strategy to make our children healthy again-due in August 2025. We invite all of America, especially the private sector and academia, to be part of the solution. The President's Make America Healthy Again Commission THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON 68"
