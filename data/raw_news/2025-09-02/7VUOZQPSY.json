      "text": "'The Summer I Turned Pretty' Season 3 is almost here. Here's when it will return.\nThe end of an era is nearly upon us.\nAnd that's because in less than two weeks, viewers will once again return to Cousins with Belly and boys for the summer. Except this trip back to Cousins will be the \"last\" one, iykyk.\nSeason 3 of \"The Summer I Turned Pretty,\" a coming-of-age romantic television series based on the popular book trilogy by bestselling author Jenny Han, premieres July 16 on Amazon Prime Video.\nThe show, which takes place over many-a summer, follows the ongoing love triangle between Belly (Lola Tung) and brothers, Conrad (Christopher Briney) and Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno) as they navigate life, growing pains and one immeasurable loss.\nAt the end of the \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" Season 2 finale, we see Belly put the past and her feelings for first love Conrad in the rearview as she focuses on her future and her budding relationship with Jeremiah.\nBut the past, specifically Conrad, has a habit of reappearing when its least convenient for Belly, who tries but might fail to keep her feelings at bay. Belly's left to make a huge decision, one that will change the course of their lives forever, by the end of the summer.\nWill Season 3 of \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" be the last time we see Belly and the boys? Here's what we know, including what best-selling author and showrunner Jenny Han has said about the possibility of a fourth season.\nWhat happens in Season 3 of 'The Summer I Turned Pretty?'\nWe're not huge fans of spoilers at USA TODAY, but what we can say with certainty is that Belly will choose someone to give her love to by the end of the summer. (Hint: You can always read the books, specifically the third book, if you're desperate to know how things will end.)\nThe new season picks up with Belly, who is looking forward to another summer in Cousins with Jeremiah after her junior year of college.\n(Everyone, including Jeremiah, knows that Conrad still has a place in Belly's heart.)\n\"Her future seems set, until some core-shaking events bring her first love Conrad back into her life,\" according to official logline for Season 3. \"Now on the brink of adulthood, Belly finds herself at a crossroads and must decide which brother has her heart. Summer will never be the same.\"\nWhile Belly's decision is the focus of Season 3, other character arcs like that of Taylor and Steven will also have their moment in the spotlight.\n'The Summer I Turned Pretty' Season 3 episode release schedule\nThe third and final season of \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" premieres July 16 on Prime Video with the first two episodes of Season 3 available to stream on premiere day.\nThe remaining Season 3 episodes, unlike the two previous seasons, will drop weekly on Wednesdays at 12:00 a.m. PT/3 a.m. ET through the Sept. 17 finale.\nHere's the full schedule:\n- Episode 3 drops Wednesday, July 23\n- Episode 4 drops Wednesday, July 30\n- Episode 5 drops Wednesday, Aug. 6\n- Episode 6 drops Wednesday, Aug. 13\n- Episode 7 drops Wednesday, Aug. 20\n- Episode 8 drops Wednesday, Aug. 27\n- Episode 9 drops Wednesday, Sept. 3\n- Episode 10 drops Wednesday, Sept. 10\n- Episode 11 (Finale) drops Wednesday, Sept. 17\n'The Summer I Turned Pretty' Season 3 cast\nIt's not summer without Belly or the boys, including Steven, of course.\n- Lola Tung is Belly, the protagonist\n- Christopher Briney is Conrad Fisher, Belly's first love\n- Gavin Casalegno is Jeremiah Fisher, Conrad's brother and Belly's boyfriend\n- Sean Kaufman is Steven, Belly's brother\n- Rain Spencer is Taylor, Belly's best friend\n- Jackie Chung is Laurel, Belly's mom and Susannah's best friend\nAdditional characters seen over the course of the show include Susannah Fisher (Rachel Blanchard), Cam (David Iacono), Skye (Elsie Fisher), Aunt Julia (Kyra Sedgwick), John Conklin (Colin Ferguson) and Adam Fisher (Tom Everett Scott).\nHow to watch 'The Summer I Turned Pretty' Season 3\nThe first two episodes of \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" Season 3 will drop on July 16 on Prime Video.

Discounted membership options for young adults and qualifying government-assistance recipients are also available.\nCustomers can purchase or rent a selection of media titles from Prime Video without having an Amazon Prime or Prime Video account.\nWill there be a Season 4 of 'The Summer I Turned Pretty?'\nThe short answer is no, but the longer answer is that Han reserves the right to revisit these characters, or this world if she ever felt like there was enough material.\nHan, herself, isn't opposed to telling more stories in the Cousins universe, telling Entertainment Weekly in a recent that she'll \"never say never \u2014 I never do.\"\nAmazon Prime Video has noted in its promotional material for the upcoming season, from imagery to the trailer, that Season 3 will be the show's last.\n\"If the story is there, then I'm there,\" Han told EW. \"As a storyteller, you just get hit with inspiration all the time. If I had a really great idea that I was excited by, that I wanted to keep telling the story, and if [the stars] were excited to do it, then I would be so pumped. It really depends on if I feel like there is more story to tell.\"\nTung, who plays Belly, is equally as excited at the thought of working with Han again in the future, whether for a sequel series or revival.\n\"I love working with this group of people and I love working with Jenny,\" Tung told EW. \"I think it's such a privilege to be any part of her cinematic universe, so if I was ever asked, I'm there.\""

      "text": "The cult of 'The Summer I Turned Pretty', explained\nBreanna Quigley thought of everything.\nFor her watch party last week for the debut of \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" Season 3, the 24-year-old in Charlotte, North Carolina, had custom cookies, matching pool floats, a popcorn machine, a custom painted banner, a big speaker, seashell place mats, a fish net table runner, blue hydrangeas ... the list goes on.\nEach item was a reference to the show about a love triangle between Belly Conklin (Lola Tung) and brothers Conrad Fisher (Christopher Briney) and Jeremiah Fisher (Gavin Casalegno) as they navigate life, growing pains and one immeasurable loss.\nBlue water appeared on Quigley's blow-up TV screen as she and her friends watched from her pool, chimes sounding as the opening credits played like a call to worship for the devout fans of Jenny Han's fan-favorite novels-turned-Amazon Prime Video series.\nQuigley, who dropped $350 on her event, is among many fans gathering at one another's homes and public venues weekly to enjoy the guilty pleasure of watching Belly navigate her love for two boys she's known her whole life \u2013 and that each present a different future for her.\nThe watch parties are pure sun-soaked indulgence for viewers who know deep in their souls whether they're Team Jeremiah or Team Conrad \u2013 and are ready to present a thesis as to why. Series creators even issued a foreboding warning imploring fans to refrain from online harassment as the angst of the season plays out.\n\"I think the show has such a following because of how it makes you feel,\" Quigley said. \"Everyone loves summer romance and I feel a lot of people can relate and love to see Belly choose between brothers. It\u2019s funny because the show can be pretty cringey but it\u2019s cute.\"\nEmphasis on the cringe. Some viewers are really embarrassed about the degree of investment they have in Season 3, despite watching these young lovers through their fingers.\n\"I'm one episode in and already cringing and very uncomfy,\" posted one audience member.\nWhen Belly and Jeremiah middle-school-style slow dance to \"Dilemma\" by Kelly Rowland and Nelly at a college frat party, one viewer physically twinged with second-hand shudders. Fans' significant others are watching from the other room, stunned and bewildered by the dynamics of a girl who loves two siblings. Bearing witness to the \"icks\" on screen are a test of endurance.\nBut why do we watch anyway, and get so invested? It reminds us so much of our own loves, the ones we lost or never had, according to Alicia M. Walker, professor of sociology at Missouri State University.\n\"Maybe we're cringing, but we might be a bit jealous, too,\" Walker said.\nWho wouldn't want to experience love for the first time against the lustful backdrop of fictional Cousins Beach, an idyllic East Coast town, Walker said. The raw unabashed relationships on screen, while we recoil, may remind viewers of any age of the significant impact of being chosen for simply being yourself, Walker said.\n\"The show doesn't just depict first love, it restores its emotional weight,\" Walker said. \"The show almost doesn't feel like fiction, it feels like memory.\"\nThe cult of \"TSITP\" is especially powerful because its ethos juxtaposes our cultural zeitgeist, one deprived of connection and defined by division, she said. We want something we can all gather around right now and root for, awkwardness included, she said.\n\"It ends up being emotional comfort food during this time,\" Walker said. \"The cult following around the show really shows how starved we are for something that we can feel, not just watch. The characters become avatars for our own longing, heartbreak, hopefulness and grief ... Whether you're 17 or 57, that hunger for connection, clarity and care is real and this show feeds that.\""

You're about to find out.\nSince the July 16 premiere of \"The Summer I Turned Pretty,\" a coming-of-age romantic TV series based on the beloved book trilogy of the same name, viewers are dying to know which Fisher is endgame.\nWill Belly (Lola Tung) stick with best friend and now fianc\u00e9 Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno), or risk everything, including her heart, for first love Conrad (Christopher Briney)?\nThe answer, unknown to those who haven't read the books, was revealed at the end of \"We'll Always Have Summer,\" the last book set in \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" universe.\n\"I think I always knew I would be Belly Fisher one day,\" bestselling author Jenny Han writes in \"We'll Always Have Summer.\" \"I just didn't know it was going to happen like this.\"\nAnd she does make a choice, one that changes her present and her future forever. If you want to know which Fisher Belly chooses, read on.\nHere's how it ends.\nWhat is 'The Summer I Turned Pretty' about?\n\"The Summer I Turned Pretty,\" at its core, is a story about \"first love, first heartbreak, and the magic of that one perfect summer.\" The show, in its third and final season, made its debut on Amazon Prime Video on July 16.\nThe story itself, which takes place over many a summer, hinges on a love triangle between Belly Conklin and brothers Conrad Fisher and Jeremiah Fisher as they navigate life, growing pains and one immeasurable loss.\nThe trio also happens to be childhood friends, the kind who have spent summer breaks together at the same place for as long as they can remember. Now, they're all grown up.\nBelly, who has just wrapped her junior year at Finch College, is feeling good about her future. She has found a friend in Anika, is still close with Taylor and has Jere by her side, just like she wanted.\nBut when \"core-shaking events\" bring first love Conrad back into her life, she finds herself at a crossroads.\n\"(Belly) must decide which brother has her heart,\" the show's official logline reads. \"Summer will never be the same\u2026\"\nWho does Belly end up with?\nBelly doesn't choose Jeremiah or Conrad because in the end, she chooses herself.\nJeremiah and Belly do not stay together, or (ever) end up having a beach wedding in Cousins. Jere goes back to live at the fraternity house, and Belly lives with Anika in her sophomore year at Finch University. (FYI: Belly is a little older in the show than she is in \"We'll Always Have Summer.\")\nBelly spends her junior year studying abroad in Spain, where she has \"lots and lots of adventures.\" Spain is also the place she hears from Conrad for the first time, following his spontaneous declaration and tearful goodbye in Cousins.\n\"Spain is where I got my first letter from him,\" Han writes. \"Real letters, written by his hand, not e-mails. I didn't write him back, not at first, but they still came, once a month, every month. The first time I saw him again, it was another year, at my college graduation. And I just knew.\"\nAnd Belly does, just like Susannah hopes, end up with a young man, whose last name is Fisher.\n\"This is our start,\" Han writes. \"This is the moment it becomes real. We are married. We are infinite. Me and Conrad. The first boy I ever slow danced with, ever cried over. Ever loved.\"\n'The Summer I Turned Pretty' cast\nIt's not summer without Belly or the boys, including Steven, of course.\n- Lola Tung is Belly Conklin, the protagonist\n- Christopher Briney is Conrad Fisher, Belly's first love and Susannah's son\n- Gavin Casalegno is Jeremiah Fisher, Conrad's brother, Belly boyfriend-turned-fianc\u00e9 and Susannah's son\n- Sean Kaufman is Steven Conklin, Belly's brother\n- Rain Spencer is Taylor Jewel, Belly's best friend\n- Jackie Chung is Laurel Conklin, Belly's mom and Susannah's best friend\nAdditional characters include Lucinda Jewel (Kristen Connolly), John Conklin (Colin Ferguson), Anika (Sofia Bryant), Agnes (Zo\u00e9 De Grand Maison), Redbird (Tanner Zagarino), Denise (Isabella Briggs) and Lacie (Lily Donoghue) among others.\nHow to watch 'The Summer I Turned Pretty'\nPrevious seasons of \"The Summer I Turned Pretty,\" including the first two episodes from Season 3, are available to stream on Prime Video.\n\"TSITP\" Season 3 premiered on Wednesday, July 16.
