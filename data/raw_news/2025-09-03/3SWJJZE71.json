  "content": "VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - September 3, 2025 (NEWMEDIAWIRE) - Norsemont Mining Inc. (CSE: NOM, OTC: NRRSF, FWB: LXZ1) (\"NOM\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that Paul Matysek has participated in an additional round of the financing first announced August 1, 2025. The Company has now closed the final tranche of a non-brokered private placement consisting of 1,000,000 units of the Company at CAD $0.60 per unit for gross proceeds of CAD $600,000 (the \"Offering\"). Each Unit will consist of one common share and one-half of one Warrant. Each Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one common share at a price of CAD $0.75 per common share for a period of two years from the date of closing (the \"Warrants\"). To date, the Company has raised aggregate gross proceeds of $6,079,199.40 under the Offering. In the event that the Company's common shares close at a price on the Exchange of CAD $1.25 or greater per common share for a period of 10 consecutive trading days after four months and one day from the closing of the Offering, the Company may accelerate the expiry of the Warrants by giving notice to the holders thereof (by disseminating a news release advising of the acceleration of the expiry date of the Warrants) and, in such case, the Warrants will expire on the ten (10th) business day after the date of such notice. For Canadian investors, there is a hold period of four months and one day from the issuance of the Units. For United States investors they will additionally be subject to hold periods as required by applicable federal and \"blue sky\" securities laws. The proceeds of the Offering are anticipated to be used for a phase 3 drill program at the Choquelimpie Gold-Silver-Copper project in Northern Chile. Use of funds will include drilling targeting the copper porphyry zone, high grade gold zones, oxide / leachable gold zone, and metallurgy, plus general working capital. The Offerings are subject to compliance with CSE policies. \"Closing over $6 million in our recent financing with support from strategic industry leaders including Rob McEwen, Crescat Capital, Dr. Quinton Hennigh and Larry Lepard, and now attracting mining entrepreneur Paul Matysek, is a powerful endorsement of our vision and the significant upside at Choquelimpie. With this backing, Norsemont is well positioned to advance drilling, metallurgy and engineering, and move toward a production scenario that can unlock substantial value for all stakeholders,\" said Marc Levy, CEO of Norsemont.\n\n\"Norsemont's Choquelimpie Project is a significant mineralized system in northern Chile, a region renowned for hosting some of the world's largest ore deposits. While only a small portion of the upper epithermal system was historically mined, the broader potential along strike and at depth remains virtually untouched. I believe a disciplined drill campaign can rapidly expand the already substantial gold and silver resources, while positioning Choquelimpie for near-term production in a strong gold market. I am very excited to invest in this opportunity as Norsemont's experienced team works to unlock the full potential of this porphyryepithermal system,\" said Paul Matysek. This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities in the United States. The securities offered have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"U.S. Securities Act\") or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons unless registered under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, unless an exemption from such registration is available. On Behalf of the Board,\n\nNORSEMONT MINING INC. \n\nMarc Levy\n\nCEO & Chairman The Norsemont team comprises experienced natural resource professionals focused on growing shareholder value and developing its flagship project through to bankable feasibility, with an initial mineral resource estimate of 2,184,000 indicated gold equivalent ounces and 557,000 inferred gold equivalent ounces for its Choquelimpie Gold-Silver-Copper project. Norsemont Mining owns a 100% interest in the Choquelimpie gold-silver-copper project in northern Chile, a previously permitted gold and silver mine with significant exploration upside. Choquelimpie has over 1,700 drill holes, with significant existing infrastructure, including roads, power, water, camp and a 3,000-tonne-per-day mill. Norsemont is committed to responsible and sustainable resource development, leveraging modern exploration techniques to unlock further value for all stakeholders.
