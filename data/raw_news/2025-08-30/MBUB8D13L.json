  "content": "Survivors of the storm that caused the deaths of eight people on Lake Tahoe in June are opening up about the weather event that sank several boats and led to eight deaths at a popular tourist destination.\n\nThe storm moved quickly on Saturday, June 21, catching many on and around Lake Tahoe by surprise. It was quiet that morning, but eight people died after a 27-foot gold Chris-Craft boat capsized \u201cdue to a large swell, the U.S. Coast Guard previously said. Two people on that vessel survived, as did others nearby.\n\nSpeaking with , Kristofer Kierce, who owns a boat salvage company in the area, was stunned by the wreckage he saw, which included other sunken boats.\n\n\u201cWe were in awe,\u201d Kierce told the newspaper. \u201cIt was like a hurricane had come through.\u201d\n\nA bachelorette party was among those caught in the dangerous storm. Judith Saldivar, 30, was on a pontoon boat in Emerald Bay with five friends when the storm whipped through.\n\n\u201cIn minutes, it turned from still water to ocean-like conditions,\u201d she recalled.\n\nThe day started off calm weather-wise. Retired TV meteorologist Mark Finan said it wasn't until Saturday morning that computer models even began detecting signs that thunderstorms and snow could impact the area, according to the Times .\n\nBut eventually, the storms rolled through and temperatures plummeted. The National Weather Service previously said wind gusts were clocked at 35 to 45 mph while temperatures plummeted 15 to 25 degrees below normal.\n\nThe Coast Guard said that at the time the 27-foot boat \u2014 called \"Over the Moon,\" according to the Times \u2014 capsized, the wind was blowing at about 30 knot winds and swells were 6 to 8 feet high.\n\nThe only people who survived the sinking were wearing life jackets, the newspaper reported.\n\n Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories \n\nThe eight victims include DoorDash executive Joshua Antony Pickles, 37, his parents Terry Pickles, 73, and Paula Bozinovich, 71, his uncle Peter Bayes, 72, and their friends Timothy O\u2019Leary, 71, Theresa Giullari, 66, James Guck, 69, and Stephen Lindsay, 63, according to a statement from Joshua\u2019s wife, previously obtained by PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cNo words can express the pain and anguish we feel knowing their lives were lost during what was meant to be a joyful time on the lake,\" Jordan Sugar-Carlsgaard said in a statement shared through a family spokesperson. \"Our hearts go out to those who tragically lost their lives and the two survivors of this unexpected and deadly storm on Lake Tahoe.\"",

The U.S. Coast Guard said in a news release that the ship Morning Midas capsized and sank in international waters approximately 450 miles southwest of Adak on Monday, June 23\u2014adding that the vessel sank to a depth of approximately 16,400 feet. The ship was delivering new vehicles to Mexico at the time of the incident, CBS News and the Associated Press reported. The sinking comes weeks after the Coast Guard received a distress alert on June 3 that a fire occurred onboard the Morning Midas. Emergency crews and three Good Samaritan vessels responded to the scene, the Coast Guard said. All 22 crew members of the Morning Midas evacuated from the ship onto a life boat and were subsequently rescued by the crew of Cosco Hellas, one of the Good Samaritan vessels, the Coast Guard added.

The exact cost of the cars isn't clear, but it's expected to be worth millions of dollars. At this time, the cause of the fire is unknown. \u201cAs the search and rescue portion of our response concludes, our crews are working closely with the vessel\u2019s manager, Zodiac Maritime, to determine the disposition of the vessel,\u201d Rear Admiral Megan Dean of the Coast Guard\u2019s Seventeenth District said at the time. \u201cWe are grateful for the selfless actions of the three nearby vessels who assisted in the response and the crew of motor vessel Cosco Hellas, who helped save 22 lives.\u201d The Coast Guard said in its latest release that there were no reports of visible signs of pollution at the present moment. The agency described the Morning Midas as a 600-foot Liberian-flagged cargo vessel managed by the London-based Zodiac Maritime. The ship reportedly carried 350 metric tons of marine gas oil (MGO) and 1,530 metric tons of very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO).

      "text": "How a Beautiful Summer Day on Lake Tahoe Suddenly Turned Deadly\nIt was a gorgeous June Saturday on Lake Tahoe, but the day turned stormy in minutes when a torrent of winds whipped up choppy waters that terrified boaters. Eight people died.\nThe Times looked at videos, radar and satellite imagery, and interviewed over 30 people, including meteorologists, local officials and boaters who were on the lake that day. The investigation revealed a rare set of circumstances that led to the unexpectedly dangerous day.\nA calm start\nA chill was in the air. Winds had pelted the Tahoe Basin the day before, prompting a wind advisory. But on the morning of June 21, puffy clouds floated across a blue sky.\nTucked in the mountains on the California-Nevada border, Lake Tahoe is popular with boaters, swimmers, hikers and skiers. Weekends are busy, and this was the first of the summer.\nBy late Saturday morning, the strong winds from the day before had calmed. A light breeze from the south blew over the lake.\nThere were no advisories from the National Weather Service that morning. The forecast warned of a slight chance for showers and thunderstorms.\nIt appeared to be a great day for boating.\nDani and Dan Johnston, 54 and 62, brought their son, Connor, and some of his friends in their boat to celebrate a college graduation. First stop: Gar Woods Grill & Pier, on the north shore.\nJoshua Pickles, 37, a Door Dash executive, and his parents hosted guests on their 28-foot-long Chris-Craft boat, Over the Moon. They were celebrating his mother\u2019s birthday.\nJudith Saldivar, 30, and five friends on a bachelorette weekend, boarded a pontoon boat. Ms. Saldivar said the weather was gorgeous, but chilly, so she and her friends bought matching layers.\nA storm forms out of sight\nAround noon, thunderstorms and showers started to develop about 20 miles northwest and began moving toward the lake.\nSnow fell over Donner Pass and throughout the region. Car crashes occurred on Interstate 80 and traffic backed up on highways around the lake.\nOn the trails surrounding a Tahoe ski resort, a 46-kilometer endurance race was cancelled when lightning got close. Hundreds of runners were brought to shelters.\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived here for 21 years, and you see that kind of aggressive weather in the winter. It\u2019s pretty rare to see it in the summer,\u201d said Brendan Madigan, a race organizer.\nMr. Madigan said the forecast for the day \u201cdid not allude to what actually happened, not even in the least.\u201d\nEven in the best conditions, meteorologists cannot predict exactly when and where a thunderstorm will develop. The Tahoe Basin\u2019s peaks and valleys add more challenges, and the June 21 storm was unusual in several ways.\nStorms there commonly form in the afternoon when the sun heats the ground, causing warm air to rise and volatile clouds to form, and they usually die off quickly.\nThat day, a different mechanism, likely a cold air mass moving in, generated the storms.\nAndrew Schwartz, with the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Central Sierra Snow Lab, said one of the storms sat over the mountains and grew for several hours while also sagging slowly toward the lake.\nForecasters\u2019 computer models failed to pick up the extreme conditions.\nIt wasn\u2019t until Saturday morning that some models started to show the potential for showers, thunderstorms and cold enough conditions for snow, said Mark Finan, a retired TV meteorologist who provided forecasting for the area for over 30 years. \u201cEven what we saw in the models on Saturday morning did not exactly match up with what happened,\u201d Mr. Finan said.\nThe lake was calm. With 10 people on board, Over the Moon dropped anchor in Emerald Bay, according to a report from the National Transportation Safety Board. The sheltered cove is known as one the world\u2019s most photographed places.\nMr. Pickles was an experienced sailor, but it was only his third time operating this boat, said Sam Singer, a family representative.\nMs. Saldivar and her group also motored to Emerald Bay.\nThe Johnstons\u2019 group soaked up the sunshine while traveling for lunch to Round Hill Pines, a resort on the east shore.\n\u201cYou could see the rain clouds to the north, but they didn\u2019t seem close,\u201d Dan Johnston said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t seem like they were moving. The normal thunderstorms usually hang there and don\u2019t come over the lake.\u201d\nStephen Henderson, who has worked as a boat captain for 22 summers on the lake, saw the same dark clouds rising to the north as he motored around the south shore with a tour group.\nHe had checked the radar before going on the water and thought the storm would be smaller and move to the east.\nWinds rush over the lake\nMany people reported that the weather on the lake changed around 2:15 p.m.\nIt was as if a faucet was suddenly turned on, and it was shooting out winds that spread across the lake\u2019s surface.\nWinds from the north traveled across the full length of the lake, creating a huge area for the waves to develop energy and grow in size.\nData from a buoy showed a change in wind direction and dramatic increase in wind speed by 3 p.m. The air temperature dipped below 40 degrees by 4 p.m.\n\u201cMy crews were reporting over eight-foot swells,\u201d said Kyle Floyd, officer in charge at the Coast Guard station in Tahoe.\nWaves spilled over the bow of the Johnstons\u2019 boat. The engine stopped.\nThey contacted 911 at 2:20 p.m.\n\u201cBoat sinking!\u201d\nThe Johnstons were being towed by a police rescue boat when all 10 people fell into the water. Everyone was wearing a life jacket. Some people were scooped up into rescue boats and others, like Ms. Johnston, swam to shore.\n\u201cI had on a sweater and puffer jacket and jeans,\u201d said Ms. Johnston, a former competitive swimmer. \u201cI think we swam 250 yards to the shore.\u201d\nLarge waves also spilled over into the boat where the bachelorette party huddled together.\n\u201cIn minutes, it turned from still water to ocean-like conditions,\u201d Ms. Saldivar said.\nTerrified, she texted her sisters.\nMr. Henderson said the waves came one right after the other.\n\u201cWaves were coming from every direction,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lot of wheel work and throttle, a lot of turning the wheel back and forth with each wave that came in.\u201d\nThe Over the Moon had left Emerald Bay, and back on the open lake it faced strong winds, marble-sized hail and waves of eight to 10 feet, with water breaking over the sides and bow of the boat. The bilge pumps, which remove water from a boat\u2019s hull, were turned on.\nThis area of the lake is steep, and with winds from the north pushing the waves toward the south shore, a sloshing motion may have developed in the water that \u201cwould have been very difficult for boating,\u201d Mr. Finan said. Just before 3 p.m., hikers saw the Over the Moon capsize and called 911. Rescue teams responded.\nIt was too late. Six bodies were recovered that day and two more were found on Sunday. Authorities identified the victims as Joshua Pickles; his parents, Paula Bozinovich, 71, and Terry Pickles, 73; and his uncle, Peter Bayes, 72. Four of their friends also died: Timothy O\u2019Leary, 71; Stephen Lindsay, 63; Theresa Giullari, 66; and James Guck, 69.\nTwo people on the boat survived \u2014 the only two who put on life jackets.\n\u201cNo words can express the pain and anguish we feel,\u201d Jordan Sugar-Carlsgaard, Joshua Pickles\u2019s wife, said in a statement.\nThe next day, damaged boats were piled up at beaches on the south shore.\n\u201cWe were in awe,\u201d said Kristofer Kierce, who owns a boat salvage company. \u201cIt was like a hurricane had come through.\u201d\nLocals said they had never seen stormy conditions unfold so suddenly.\nMany meteorologists The Times interviewed said a main cause on June 21 was the decaying thunderstorm just north of the lake. It may have generated a downdraft, a column of sinking cold air and precipitation that drops down from the storm cloud toward the ground.\nAs rain fell into dry air, some of it evaporated. This process cools the surrounding air, whipping up winds.\nWhat we know for sure is that the technology meteorologists use to predict weather failed to pick up the localized conditions that sent winds flying across the lake.\n\u201cThere was no signal on radar that would indicate a severe wind event was about to occur,\u201d said Dawn Johnson, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in Reno.\n\u201cPeople underestimate Lake Tahoe. It\u2019s a big body of water,\u201d said Neil Lareau, an atmospheric scientist with University of Nevada, Reno. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in that summer mode, thinking about this beautiful place, thinking about this carefree summer environment, and then having a storm system more akin to what you would find in April, it can quickly become dangerous.\u201d"
