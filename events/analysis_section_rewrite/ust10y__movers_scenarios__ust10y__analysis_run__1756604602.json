      "feedback": "The draft’s four lines violate several core rules: (1) each “Driver/Mechanism” must be a single, market‑relevant driver that maps to a canonical handle (spx in this case); (2) the “What to watch” section must list catalysts that directly trigger that driver, not unrelated items (e.g., defense bill passage is a catalyst for the defense‑spending driver, not for a Fed‑rate‑cut driver); (3) probabilities must reflect the base‑case outlook (spx expected to decline 1–2 % over 3–6 months, so down‑side weights should be ≥ 60 % and up‑side ≤ 30 %); (4) each factual claim (driver, catalyst, probability) should carry an inline citation (e.g., FAN5RYW6T for Fed policy, O6LHRBLFM for the defense bill, F7K7Y35U5 for the copper tariff case). Revise the lines to: (a) “Up | next 3‑6 months | Fed rate cut (FAN5RYW6T) | Fed September policy (FAN5RYW6T), early‑August CPI (FAN5RYW6T), 2‑yr/10‑yr spread (FAN5RYW6T) | 20 %”; (b) “Up | next 3‑6 months | Defense spending bill (O6LHRBLFM) | Defense bill passage (O6LHRBLFM) | 10 %”; (c) “Down | next 3‑6 months | Concentration risk (FAN5RYW6T) | Top‑ten stocks, earnings cycle (FAN5RYW6T) | 65 %”; (d) “Down | next 3‑6 months | Sticky inflation & labor softness (FAN5RYW6T) | July CPI/PCE (FAN5RYW6T), September payrolls (FAN5RYW6T), Fed September policy (FAN5RYW6T) | 70 %”. Ensure each line is a single sentence, uses the exact “Up/Down | Time window | Driver | What to watch | Probability %” format, and includes the required citations.",
