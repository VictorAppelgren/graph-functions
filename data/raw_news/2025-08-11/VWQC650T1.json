  "title": "Jon Gruden gets key legal win vs. NFL in Nevada Supreme Court ruling",
  "description": "The Nevada Supreme Court ruled that Jon Gruden's lawsuit against the NFL, first filed in 2021, cannot be arbitrated behind closed doors.",
  "content": "\u2022 The Nevada Supreme Court ruled Jon Gruden's lawsuit against the league cannot be forced behind closed doors into arbitration.\n\u2022 Gruden's lawsuit alleges that the NFL deliberately leaked disparaging emails he wrote.\n\u2022 The court sided with the former Raiders coach and found that an arbitration clause in the NFL's Constitution is \"unconscionable.\"\n\nJon Gruden has picked up a crucial victory in his yearslong legal fight with the NFL.\n\nThe Nevada Supreme Court ruled Aug. 11 that Gruden's lawsuit against the league, which alleges that it deliberately leaked disparaging emails he wrote, cannot be forced behind closed doors into arbitration.\n\nIn a 5-2 decision, the court sided with the former Las Vegas Raiders coach and found that an arbitration clause in the NFL's Constitution is \"unconscionable\" because it would effectively allow commissioner Roger Goodell to arbitrate disputes over his own conduct.\n\n\"We're very pleased with the Nevada Supreme Court's decision, not just for Coach Gruden but for all employees facing an employer's unfair arbitration process,\" Gruden's attorney Adam Hosmer-Henner said in a statement. \"This victory further vindicates Coach Gruden's reputation, and it clears the way to swiftly bringing him full justice and holding the NFL accountable.\"\n\nAn NFL spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe league's only remaining next step would be to appeal Monday's decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. But it is unclear if the league intends to make such a move \u2212 and, if it did, whether the U.S. Supreme Court would agree to hear the case.\n\nThe Nevada Supreme Court's ruling comes nearly four years after Gruden's dramatic resignation as head coach of the Raiders, amid public outcry over emails he had written when he was working as an NFL analyst for ESPN between 2011 and 2018. The emails, which were obtained as part of an investigation into the then-Washington Football Team, were published by multiple news outlets and included misogynistic and homophobic language.\n\nGruden subsequently sued the NFL and Goodell in November 2021, alleging that they had deliberately leaked the emails to news outlets in a \"malicious and orchestrated campaign\" to destroy his career. The NFL has previously described those claims as \"baseless\" and said only Gruden is at fault for the contents of emails he wrote.\n\nMost of the legal battle in the years since has been not about the details of the case, but rather where it should be resolved. Gruden has argued that his lawsuit should proceed in public view, in a Nevada district court, because he was not a team or league employee at the time of the dispute. The NFL, meanwhile, has sought to push the case into private arbitration and cited a broad arbitration clause in its constitution, which all league employees must abide by.\n\nA district judge in Nevada initially ruled in Gruden's favor, but the NFL then successfully appealed the matter to a three-judge panel of the state's supreme court. Monday's ruling, and reversal, came after Gruden requested a rehearing before the full court.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @tomschad.bsky.social.",

      "text": "NFL scores legal victory in ex-Raiders coach Jon Gruden's lawsuit against league\nJon Gruden's lawsuit against the NFL will be moved behind closed doors after the Nevada Supreme Court handed the league a significant legal victory Tuesday.\nBy a 2-1 margin, the highest court in the state reversed an earlier decision that would've allowed Gruden's lawsuit against the NFL to move forward in public, instead determining that it falls under the league's arbitration provision.\nThe ruling essentially means that, barring a successful appeal, the claims in Gruden's lawsuit will be dealt with outside of the public eye \u2212 with commissioner Roger Goodell, or someone appointed by him, overseeing the league's arbitration proceedings.\nThe NFL and Gruden's attorney did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\nGruden, the former head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, sued the league and commissioner Roger Goodell in November 2021 after multiple news outlets published excerpts of leaked emails he wrote from 2011-18, when he was working as an NFL analyst for ESPN. The emails, in which Gruden used homophobic and misogynistic language, led to his resignation as Raiders coach.\nGruden argued in the lawsuit that Goodell and the league deliberately leaked the emails, which were obtained as part of a separate investigation into the then-Washington Football Team, in a \"malicious and orchestrated campaign\" to destroy his career. The NFL called Gruden's claims \"baseless\" and wrote in a filing that \"he has no one to blame but himself.\"\nIn the years since, much of the legal fight between the two sides has centered on whether the dispute should proceed publicly in a Nevada district court or privately in arbitration. The league generally tries to keep its disputes behind closed doors by pointing to the broad arbitration clause in its constitution, to which all league employees must agree. But Gruden's lawyers have argued that the arbitration clause should not apply in this case for a variety of reasons, including that the former coach was no longer a league employee at the time of the dispute.\nGruden also argued that the notion of Goodell serving as the arbitrator in a dispute to which he is a party is \"unconscionable,\" while the NFL has noted that the commissioner has the ability to appoint a third party to oversee disputes and could do so again in this case.\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @Tom_Schad."
