  "argos_summary": "Asian equities are performing strongly, especially in China, drawing attention to growth companies with high insider ownership. TUHU Car shows solid revenue growth but declining margins and trades below its fair value. Bestechnic enjoys robust earnings growth and a high valuation, yet remains slightly undervalued relative to its fair value with a promising outlook. Ninestar is overvalued compared to fair value, carries high debt and negative earnings, but offers strong growth potential and solid shareholder returns. The screener highlights attractive opportunities, but investors should carefully assess valuation gaps and risk factors.",
