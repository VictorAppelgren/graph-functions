  "title": "The Latest: Mayor Bowser calls Trump's plan to take over DC police \u2018unsettling\u2019",
  "description": "Washington, D",
  "content": "\u201cWhile this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can\u2019t say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we\u2019re totally surprised,\u201d Bowser said.\n\nUS and China extend trade truce another 90 days\n\nTrump has extended a trade truce with China for another 90 days, at least delaying once again a dangerous showdown between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.\n\nThe previous deadline was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. Had that happened, the U.S. would have ratcheted up taxes on Chinese imports from an already high 30%, and Beijing would have responded by raising retaliatory levies on U.S. exports to China.\n\nThe pause buys time for the two countries to work out some of their differences, perhaps clearing the way for a summit later this year between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about the tariff suspension extension\n\nA federal judge is hearing arguments on whether military troops deployed this summer by the Trump administration to Los Angeles violated a federal law that bars troops from conducting law enforcement duties within the country.\n\nJudge Charles Breyer will decide whether the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act was violated when 4,700 California National Guard members and Marines were sent following protests over immigration raids.\n\nA deputy commanding general testified Monday that military forces called in were allowed to take some law enforcement actions despite the federal law that prohibits the president from using the military as a domestic police force.\n\nThe administration has argued that federal military members are allowed to protect federal property and agents as part of their mission carrying out federal operations.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about the trial that could set the precedent for how Trump can deploy the guard in the future\n\nTrump\u2019s big bill is powering his mass deportations. Congress is starting to ask questions\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what\u2019s arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.\n\nThe staggering sum is powering the nation\u2019s sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation \u2014 the cornerstone of Trump\u2019s promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.\n\nThe crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight.\n\nThe bill text provided general funding categories \u2014 almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \u2014 but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about the funding behind Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda\n\nTrump\u2019s moves toward taking over Washington are unprecedented. Here\u2019s what the law says\n\nD.C.\u2019s historically majority Black population wasn\u2019t electing its own city council and mayor until 1973, when Republican President Richard Nixon signed the Home Rule Act.\n\nThe measure still left significant power to the president and Congress, though no president has exercised the police powers before.\n\nSection 740 of the Home Rule Act allows for the president to take over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department for 48 hours, with possible extensions to 30 days, during times of emergencies. No president has done so before, said Monica Hopkins, executive director of the ACLU of Washington.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear how long the takeover might last or exactly what it might mean. It could also face challenges in court.\n\nThe law is specific to D.C. and doesn\u2019t affect other communities around the U.S. referred to as having their own \u201chome rule\u201d powers in relationship to their state governments.\n\nThe president posted on social media that he has picked E.J. Antoni, an economist at conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation to lead the agency in charge of the monthly jobs report, the consumer price index and other indicators.\n\nTrump dismissed the previous commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after the July jobs report contained dramatic downward revisions of 258,000 jobs combined in June and May, suggesting a weaker economy than what the president had claimed.\n\nThe president has said the jobs report is rigged, and Antoni has frequently criticized the report, putting him outside of mainstream economists.\n\n\u201cE.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.\n\nTrump\u2019s tax law will mostly benefit the rich, while leaving poorer Americans with less, CBO says\n\nTrump\u2019stax and spending law will result in less income for the poorest Americans while sending money to the richest, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported Monday.\n\nThe CBO estimates that the 10% of poorest Americans will lose roughly $1,200 a year as they experience restrictions on government programs like Medicaid and food assistance, while the richest 10% of Americans will see their income increase by $13,600 from tax cuts.\n\nOverall, American households will see more income from the tax cuts in the legislation, including middle income households, but the largest benefit will go to the top 10% of earners.\n\nRoughly 2.4 million people won\u2019t be eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program under new work requirements for many recipients, the CBO found. Low-income Americans could also see their income reduced through further restrictions on food aid and other types of assistance included in the law.\n\nHow the National Guard deployment in DC will work\n\nAccording to the Army, Guard troops will be deployed under Title 32, or \u201cfederal-state status\u201d authority. That means the troops can conduct law enforcement activities on the streets of the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 though, at the moment, that doesn\u2019t appear to be the plan.\n\n\u201cTheir duties will include an array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence in support of law enforcement,\u201d according to a statement from the Army, to which the District of Columbia National Guard directed all questions.\n\nAbout 500 federal law enforcement officers are being assigned to patrols in Washington, including from the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Drug Enforcement Administration; Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and the Marshals Service.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth told reporters that Guard members will be \u201cflowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.\u201d\n\nThe timeline for the troop deployment is vaguely defined. According to Trump\u2019s directive, National Guard troops will remain deployed until the president determines \u201cthat conditions of law and order have been restored.\u201d\n\n\u25b6 Read more about how Trump has deployed the National Guard to cities during his second term\n\nTrump wants his Cabinet to work with Intel CEO he had wanted fired\n\nTrump retreated from his calls for chipmaker Intel to dismiss its CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, after meeting with him on Monday.\n\nThe president on social media called the meeting \u201cvery interesting\u201d and said Tan\u2019s \u201csuccess and rise is an amazing story.\u201d\n\nTrump said Tan would meet with members of his Cabinet and bring suggestions to him next week on how to proceed.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also attended the Monday meeting.\n\nBowser works to avoid fight with Trump but can\u2019t disguise some anger\n\nThe D.C. mayor fielded multiple questions Monday designed to get her to say something harsh about Trump. But she didn\u2019t take the bait for the most part, calmly laying out the city\u2019s case that crime has been dropping steadily and Trump\u2019s perceived state of emergency simply doesn\u2019t match the numbers.\n\nShe repeatedly acknowledged that Trump has \u201cbroad authority\u201d under the law and would be difficult to challenge.\n\nThe composure slipped a bit toward the end, when she dropped a reference to Trump\u2019s \u201cso-called emergency.\u201d\n\nTrump could extend takeover of DC police for 30 days, then he needs congressional approval\n\nTrump is invoking Section 740 of the DC Home Rule Act to take over control of the city\u2019s police department, saying in a letter to a congressional committee that the police force is needed for federal purposes.\n\nThe Republican president says in the letter sent to the House Oversight Committee Monday that he is taking the action for the purpose of \u201cmaintaining law and order in the nation\u2019s seat of government; protecting federal buildings, national monuments, and other federal property; and ensuring conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the federal government.\u201d\n\nBy invoking the law, Trump is able to take over the police for more than 48 hours, but if he wants to continue for more than 30 days, both the House and Senate would need to give him a vote of approval.\n\nJeffries, the top House Democrat, said the administration \u201chas consistently broken the law and violated the Constitution to further the personal and political agenda of a wannabe king.\u201d\n\nHis statement did not mention any immediate actions congressional Democrats would take in response to Trump\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party has zero credibility on the issue of law and order,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t care about public safety. On his first day in office, he pardoned hundreds of violent felons\u2014many of whom brazenly assaulted law enforcement officers on January 6. We stand with the residents of the District of Columbia and reject this unjustified power grab as illegitimate.\u201d\n\nDC mayor says she was unaware of Trump\u2019s plan to take over city police\n\nThe mayor said she had \u201cone brief call\u201d with the White House over the weekend about activating the National Guard, so she thought Trump\u2019s announcement would be about calling up the National Guard, not about taking over the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nRep. John Moolenaar, the Republican chair of the House Select Committee on China, spoke against the Trump administration\u2019s deal to get a 15% cut in the sales of advanced U.S. chips to China in exchange of export licenses.\n\n\u201cExport controls are a frontline defense in protecting our national security, and we should not set a precedent that incentivizes the government to grant licenses to sell China technology that will enhance its AI capabilities,\u201d the Republican from Michigan said.\n\nTrump confirmed the deal but suggested the chips to be sold to China are \u201cessentially old.\u201d U.S. companies are still banned from selling their most advanced chips to China, which are critical in developing artificial intelligence.\n\nD.C.'s mayor said Monday that the city had reached a 30-year low in violent crime. Bowser said crime was down not just from a post-pandemic peak in 2023, but from 2019 levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBowser highlighted the district\u2019s parks, schools and public transportation and said it was important for residents and visitors to know \u201cjust how beautiful our city is and how proud we are of all that we\u2019ve accomplished here.\n\nBowser\u2019s comments are a response to Trump\u2019s announcement of his takeover of D.C. police force. Bowser said the steps were \u201cunsettling.\"\n\n\u201cMy message to residents is this: We know that access to our democracy is tenuous. That is why you have heard me and many Washingtonians before me advocate for full statehood,\" Bowser said.\n\nThe union representing D.C. police officers is backing Trump\u2019s takeover move, though it called for the federal intervention to be temporary.\n\nChairman Gregg Pemberton said the union agrees with the president that \u201cimmediately action is necessary\u201d to tamp down crime.\n\nStill, Pemberton said the city ultimately needs a police department that\u2019s \u201cfully staffed and supported.\u201d\n\nHe also called for the repeal of criminal justice policies and laws passed by the City Council.\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore says Trump\u2019s decision to deploy the National Guard in D.C. is also \u201cdeeply dangerous.\u201d\n\nMoore, a Democrat who served as a paratrooper and captain in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan, said in a statement that the president\u2019s actions lack both data and a battle plan.\n\n\u201cHe is simply using honorable men and women as pawns to distract us from his policies, which continue to drive up unemployment and strip away health care and food assistance from those who need it most,\u201d Moore said.\n\nHe urged the president to look to Maryland for ways of reducing violent crime. Moore noted that homicides in Maryland are down by more than 20% since Moore\u2019s inauguration in January 2023.\n\n\u201cWe await outreach from the White House if they want to have a serious conversation about public safety. But we won\u2019t hold our breath,\u201d he said.\n\nA federal appeals court has given the Trump administration until Friday to restore a website that tracks spending appropriated by Congress.\n\nIn a Saturday ruling, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit refused to block a lower court order requiring the restoration. The court said disclosing the spending information was a \u201cpermissible exercise of legislative authority\u201d with roots in the nation\u2019s founding. An email to the Office of Management and Budget on Monday was not immediately returned.\n\nThe database at issue in the case first went up in July 2022. The Trump administration pulled it down in March. It argued publicly disclosing spending decisions intrudes on executive power. The administration has faced numerous lawsuits over decisions to freeze spending authorized by Congress.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton blasts Trump\u2019s DC police takeover as \u2018an assault\u2019 on Black cities\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement that he would deploy National Guard troop to take over the city\u2019s police department, the Rev. Al Sharpton warned of the move\u2019s potential long-term repercussions.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump was inspired to take this disgusting, dangerous, and derogatory action solely out of self interest,\u201d the civil rights leader said in a statement. \u201cLet\u2019s call the inspiration for this assault on a majority Black city for what it is: another bid to distract his angry, frustrated base over his administration\u2019s handling of the Epstein files.\u201d\n\nSharpton said D.C.\u2019s leadership must push back on the president\u2019s use of the city and its residents as \u201cpolitical props.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot, nor will we, take this lying down,\u201d he said. \u201cThreatening to hit if people spit, calling all Black and low-income neighborhoods slums, and throwing away the humanity of homeless people by equating them to criminals is the beginning of the end if we don\u2019t stand up. This is the ultimate affront to justice and civil rights many of us have dedicated our lives to protecting and expanding.\u201d\n\nThe top prosecutor in the nation\u2019s capital is calling Trump\u2019s move to take over the city\u2019s police department \u201cunnecessary and unlawful.\u201d\n\nDistrict of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb says crime is not an emergency levels. After a spike in 2023, violent crime hit its lowest level in decades last year and has continued to sink in 2025, he said.\n\nThe federal takeover could face a challenge in court, and Schwalb said his office is \u201cconsidering all of our options.\u201d\n\nTrump goofs on location and date of Putin summit during briefing\n\nTrump said a couple of times during the press briefing that he would be traveling to Russia to meet with Vladimir Putin \u2014 but their summit is taking place in Alaska.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to Russia on Friday,\u201d he said in one instance.\n\nHe also made an erroneous reference at another time to the summit being next week instead.\n\nThe president began the briefing Monday by commenting on the large crowd of journalists gathered for the news conference. He said he\u2019d never seen the media briefing room as crowded as it was. Later during the briefing, he joked they may be violating fire codes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done this for years now, hard to believe,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this room so packed. In fact, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a violation of every fire code.\u201d\n\nTrump said that in his meeting with Putin, he\u2019ll review that country\u2019s \u2018parameters\u2019 to end war\n\n\u201cNow I may leave and say, \u2018Good luck,\u2019 and that\u2019ll be the end,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump on the upcoming meeting with Putin: \u2018I think it\u2019ll be good, but it might be bad\u2019\n\nTrump says he can see a scenario where the U.S. and Russia normalize trade relations if things go well at his meeting with Putin later this week.\n\n\u201cI do, yeah,\u201d he responded when asked about whether he could see the potential ahead of the Alaska meeting.\n\nHe said \u201cRussia has a very valuable piece of land\u201d and mused about what would happen if \u201cPutin would go toward business instead of war.\u201d\n\nAs for the prospect of progress at that meeting? Trump said: \u201cI think it\u2019ll be good, but it might be bad.\u201d\n\nTrump says \u2018we\u2019ll see what happens\u2019 with China as tariff truce deadline looms\n\nThat came during a news conference after Trump was asked whether he plans to extend his 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs on China.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade truce ends Aug. 12, and if it isn\u2019t extended, rates on Chinese goods could climb back to over 80%.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been dealing quite nicely,\u201d Trump said, adding that he has a good relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe president said he was open to meeting with Putin first and then meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy or meeting with both together \u2014 though he didn\u2019t say he\u2019d push for a three-person meeting.\n\nTrump said \u201cPresident Putin invited me to get involved\u201d and even said he thought it was very respectful that Putin is coming to U.S. territory for the meeting in Alaska, instead of insisting that Trump go to Russia.\n\nHe said he\u2019ll tell Putin that it\u2019s time to end Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine.\n\nTrump says he\u2019s \u2018looking at\u2019 reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at reclassification,\u201d Trump said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s early.\u201d\n\nHe said he planned to make a determination in the coming weeks.\n\nThe president said marijuana \u201cdoes bad for the children,\u201d but that easing penalties associated with it is a \u201cvery complicated subject\u201d because some people support doing so.\n\nTrump said he\u2019d \u201cheard great things having to do with medical\u201d use of marijuana.\n\nA potential move to remove marijuana from the list of Schedule I controlled substances to a Schedule III drug would make it significantly easier to buy and sell cannabis.\n\nThe president says other cities could be subject to the same efforts\n\nTrump said he hopes other cities, including Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, are watching the steps he\u2019s announced in D.C. and would take steps to \u201cself-clean up.\u201d\n\nHe said that if needed, the administration would take similar steps in other cities and criticized their leadership at the local and state levels.\n\nTrump says he\u2019s bringing in 800 National Guard members to assist with law enforcement in DC\n\nIn addition, Trump also said \u201cwe will bring in the military if it\u2019s needed\u201d but added, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need it.\u201d\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth compared sending the Guard into the nation\u2019s capital to deployments to the southern U.S. border and Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWe will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement,\u201d Hegseth said.\n\nHegseth said the D.C. National Guard will be \u201cflowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.\u201d\n\nHe also said the Pentagon was \u201cprepared to bring in other National Guard units, other specialized units.\u201d\n\nTrump says he signed documents to give himself authority to crack down on crime in Washington\n\nThe president said he signed an executive order and presidential memorandum in the Oval Office before holding his news conference.\n\nOne executive order invoked presidential powers under the Home Rule Act to take over Washington\u2019s police force.\n\nHe also signed what the administration called statutorily required notification letters to DC Mayor Bowser and relevant congressional leaders.\n\nTrump also signed a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy the National Guard in the nation\u2019s capital.",

  "summary": "The US and China have extended a 90-day trade truce between them for 90 days, delaying a potential showdown between the world's two largest economies. The extension of the trade truce could potentially prevent a showdown, with the U.S. increasing taxes on Chinese imports from 30% to 30%, and China responding by raising retaliatory levies on U.K. exports to China. A federal judge is hearing arguments on whether military troops deployed by the Trump administration to Los Angeles violated a federal law that prohibits troops from conducting law enforcement duties within the country. The Republican Party's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that included nearly $170 billion for the Department of Homeland Security, nearly doubling its annual budget, is causing questions in Congress and beyond. The funding is fueling the nation's new immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, a cornerstone of Trump\u2019s plan for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.

      "text": "What\u2019s in the latest version of Trump\u2019s big bill that passed the Senate\nWhat\u2019s in the latest version of Trump\u2019s big bill that passed the Senate\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republicans are getting closer to the finish line in getting their tax and spending cut bill through Congress with a final House vote possible on Wednesday.\nAt some 887 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. President Donald Trump has admonished Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July.\nDemocrats are united against the legislation, but are powerless to stop the bill if Republicans are united. The Senate passed the bill, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. The House passed an earlier iteration of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. Now, it will take up the Senate-amended measure.\nHere\u2019s the latest on what\u2019s in the bill. There could be changes as GOP lawmakers continue to negotiate.\nTax cuts are the priority\nRepublicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump\u2019s first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.\nThe existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay, the ability to deduct interest payments for some automotive loans, along with a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.\nIt would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.\nA cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It\u2019s a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.\nThere are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research.\nThe wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House\u2019s version.\nMiddle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.\nMoney for deportations, a border wall and the Golden Dome\nThe bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump\u2019s border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.\nMoney would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.\nThe homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions.\nTo help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.\nFor the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.\nHow to pay for it? Cuts to Medicaid and other programs\nTo help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for the poor.\nRepublicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.\nThe package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program\u2019s work requirements.\nThere\u2019s also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.\nMore than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.\nRepublicans are looking to have states pick up some of the cost for SNAP benefits. Currently, the federal government funds all benefit costs. Under the bill, states beginning in 2028 will be required to contribute a set percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. Payment errors include both underpayments and overpayments.\nBut the Senate bill temporarily delays the start date of that cost-sharing for states with the highest SNAP error rates. Alaska has the highest error rate in the nation at nearly 25%, according to Department of Agriculture data. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had fought for the exception. She was a decisive vote in getting the bill through the Senate.\nA \u2018death sentence\u2019 for clean energy?\nRepublicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden\u2019s 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering healthcare costs.\nDemocratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a \u201cdeath sentence for America\u2019s wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.\u201d\nA tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.\nMeanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.\nTrump savings accounts and so, so much more\nA number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.\nThe House and Senate both have a new children\u2019s savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.\nThe Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump\u2019s long-sought \u201cNational Garden of American Heroes.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a new excise tax on university endowments. A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated. One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.\nAnother section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.\nBillions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for the exploration of Mars.\nAdditionally, a provision would increase the nation\u2019s debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.\nLast-minute changes\nThe Senate overwhelmingly revolted against a proposal meant to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence. Republican governors across the country asked for the moratorium to be removed and the Senate voted to do so with a resounding 99-1 vote.\nA provision was thrown in at the final hours that will provide $10 billion annually to rural hospitals for five years, or $50 billion in total. The Senate bill had originally provided $25 billion for the program, but that number was upped to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that reduced Medicaid provider taxes would hurt rural hospitals.\nThe amended bill also stripped out a new tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China.\nWhat\u2019s the final cost?\nAltogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034.\nOr not, depending on how one does the math.\nSenate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already \u201ccurrent policy.\u201d Republican senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.\nUnder the alternative Senate GOP view, the bill would reduce deficits by almost half a trillion dollars over the coming decade, the CBO said.\nDemocrats say this is \u201cmagic math\u201d that obscures the true costs of the tax breaks. Some nonpartisan groups worried about the country\u2019s fiscal trajectory are siding with Democrats in that regard. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans are employing an \u201caccounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.\u201d\n___"

      "text": "A look at how Trump\u2019s big bill could change the US immigration system\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s spending cuts and border security package would inject roughly $150 billion into his mass deportation agenda over the next four years, funding everything from an extension of the United States\u2019 southern border wall to detention centers to thousands of additional law enforcement staff.\nThe current annual budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the government\u2019s primary department for immigration enforcement, is around $10 billion. If the Republican president\u2019s big bill passes in Congress, the immense cash infusion could reshape America\u2019s immigration system by expanding the law enforcement and detention network while increasing costs to legally immigrate to the U.S.\nThe Senate is debating its own version of the bill, which largely aligns with the House\u2019s approach when it comes to these issues. In recent days, Republicans have focused on sometimes-violent protests against Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown to press for quick passage over Democratic opposition.\nThat\u2019s what happened earlier in June when protests triggered unrest in parts of Los Angeles.\n\u201cThe lawlessness happening in LA is ANOTHER reason why we need to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill IMMEDIATELY,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X. \u201cIt provides the ESSENTIAL funding needed to secure our nation\u2019s borders.\u201d\nPlenty, though, remains unclear about the legislation.\n\u201cOne thing about this bill, these sections are super vague,\u201d said Adam Isacson, a researcher with the Washington-based human rights advocacy organization WOLA, including multibillion-dollar expenditures sometimes explained in just a few vague lines. \u201cThere\u2019s no real specificity in the bill about how it\u2019s going to be spent.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a look at some key immigration sections of the 1,000-page bill, as approved by the House, and what it could mean for the U.S. government\u2019s posture on immigration:\nPROJECT: The wall\nWHAT THE BILL SAYS: The bill sets aside $46.5 billion for what the House Homeland Security Committee calls an \u201cintegrated border barrier system,\u201d including fencing, water barriers, law enforcement access roads and technology like movement sensors. The funding would complete 701 miles (1,128 kilometers) of primary walls and 900 miles (1,448 kilometers) of river barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the committee. It is the bill\u2019s largest expenditure.\n\u201cAny lawmaker who claims to care about border security will need to put their money where their mouth is and work to advance these recommendations,\u201d said the committee\u2019s chairman, Republican Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee.\nTHE IMPACT: Building the wall has long been one of Trump\u2019s signature promises, but its impacts beyond political symbolism are unclear. Illegal border crossings have plunged since Trump took office in January amid a string of orders on immigration, including the suspension of the asylum system. Simply ending asylum meant tens of thousands of people who would\u2019ve surrendered to law enforcement instead of trying to avoid capture didn\u2019t even attempt to cross.\nPlus, the effectiveness of border walls is hotly debated, even in populated areas where barriers tend to be heavily reinforced. Human smugglers, often linked to drug cartels, have used tunnels, ladders and power tools to cross walls.\nBut, experts note that though illegal crossings are down now, that can change rapidly.\nPROJECT: Detention facilities and staff\nWHAT THE BILL SAYS: The bill, which top White House aide and immigration hawk Stephen Miller has called \u201cthe most essential piece of legislation currently under consideration in the entire Western World,\u201d sets aside $45 billion to expand the network of immigrant detention facilities for adult migrants and families.\nThe standards in adult facilities, the bill notes, would be set at \u201cthe sole discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security.\u201d\nMore than $12 billion was also requested for 18,000 new ICE and Border Patrol personnel.\nTHE IMPACT: ICE has said it wants to increase its current detention capacity from about 41,000 people to 100,000. It\u2019s part of what ICE\u2019s acting director, Todd Lyons, has suggested is a deportation system that could function \u201clike Amazon, trying to get your product delivered in 24 hours.\u201d\nICE currently has about 6,000 deportation officers, a number that\u2019s been stagnant for years.\nWhile expanding staff and detention centers would make it easier for the administration to increase deportations, even the tens of billions of dollars the bill requests may not be enough to meet Trump\u2019s goals. Miller has said ICE should be making 3,000 arrests per day of people in the country illegally. That\u2019s a vast increase over the roughly 650 arrested a day in the first five months of Trump\u2019s second term.\nBut the plans are a boon to America\u2019s private prison industry, with stock prices for the two dominant companies, Geo Group Inc. and CoreCivic, up more than 50% since Trump\u2019s election.\nPROJECT: Immigration courts\nWHAT THE BILL SAYS: The legislation sets aside $1.25 billion for the immigration court system, with funds to hire more immigration judges and support staff and to expand courtroom capacity. The courts\u2019 annual budget currently stands at roughly $850 million.\nTHE IMPACT: The immigration court system, which has roughly 700 judges, has struggled for years with chronic understaffing and a backlog that has reached more than 3.6 million cases. Judges typically take more than five years to make decisions.\nIt\u2019s a chaotic system, with overworked judges, a shortage of translators and immigrants who often don\u2019t have lawyers.\nThe chaos has grown in recent weeks, with immigration courts seeing a spike in arrests outside courtrooms as agents wait to detain immigrants attending routine hearings. The arrests have spread fed confusion and fear, especially among asylum-seekers, who are accustomed to remaining free while their cases plod their way through the system.\nThe proposed funding would be \u201ca significant increase, and from an institutional perspective it\u2019s urgently needed money,\u201d said Greg Chen, director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\nBut he also believes the rising numbers of courthouse arrests reflect an administration looking for ways to bypass immigration courts.\nPROJECT: Immigration fees\nWHAT THE BILL SAYS: The bill overhauls the system of immigration costs, with dramatic increases and new fees imposed for once-free services.\nApplying for asylum, which has long been free, will now cost $1,000, with asylum-seekers paying another $550 for employment applications. Among other fee increases, appealing an immigration judge decision jumps from $110 to $900 and applying for temporary protected status, which allows people from certain countries facing civil unrest or natural disasters to stay temporarily in the U.S., goes from $50 to $500.\nTHE IMPACT: For wealthier immigrants, the new fees will be an inconvenience. But for the vast majority of people even a few hundred dollars could be enough to make them change their plans."

      "text": "Trump\u2019s order to deploy troops in DC is his latest use of the National Guard in cities\nTrump\u2019s order to deploy troops in DC is his latest use of the National Guard in cities\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is bringing in 800 National Guard members to help law enforcement fight crime in Washington, but just 100 to 200 of the troops will be on the city\u2019s streets at any given time, the Army said.\nTrump\u2019s directive Monday for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to activate the National Guard is just the latest example of him sending the Guard into cities to support immigration enforcement or fight crime over the objection of local and state officials.\nHow the National Guard deployment in DC will work\nAccording to the Army, Guard troops will be deployed under Title 32, or \u201cfederal-state status\u201d authority. That means the troops can conduct law enforcement activities on the streets of the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 though, at the moment, that doesn\u2019t appear to be the plan.\n\u201cTheir duties will include an array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence in support of law enforcement,\u201d according to a statement from the Army, to which the District of Columbia National Guard directed all questions.\nAbout 500 federal law enforcement officers are being assigned to patrols in Washington, including from the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Drug Enforcement Administration; Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and the Marshals Service.\nHegseth told reporters that Guard members will be \u201cflowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.\u201d He said the Pentagon also was prepared to bring in other \u201cspecialized\u201d Guard units, though he didn\u2019t offer any further details.\nThe timeline for the troop deployment is vaguely defined. According to Trump\u2019s directive, National Guard troops will remain deployed until the president determines \u201cthat conditions of law and order have been restored.\u201d\nBesides the 800 Guard members, Trump said \u201cwe will bring in the military if it\u2019s needed\u201d \u2014 seemingly referring to active duty troops in addition to the Guard \u2014 but added that \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need it.\u201d\nHegseth later seemed to suggest the Guard troops could take a more active role.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to have National Guard just sitting there like this, seeing a crime committed (and) not do something about it,\u201d he said Monday evening on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cThe Ingraham Angle.\u201d\nAsked whether the troops would be detaining Americans, Hegseth first said \u201cthey\u2019re not going to be involved in law enforcement functions\u201d before adding, \u201cI will have their back to ensure they can take the necessary action to protect citizens of D.C. and to protect themselves.\u201d\nHe said the troops could detain people and then hand them over to law enforcement, as was done this summer in Los Angeles.\nTrump recently sent Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles\nThe deployment of troops to Washington comes after the Pentagon has pulled out the vast majority of the roughly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 active duty Marines that Trump sent to Los Angeles in late June.\nTrump argued that the deployment was necessary after his administration\u2019s immigration crackdown led to protests throughout the city. Troops were largely tasked with protecting federal buildings and guarding immigration agents as they conducted raids.\nHegseth compared plans to send troops into the nation\u2019s capital to their deployment to the U.S.-Mexico border and to Los Angeles.\n\u201cWe will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement,\u201d Hegseth said.\nHowever, California\u2019s governor and city officials argued that the LA deployment was unnecessary and went to court to try to fight it.\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters that the National Guard\u2019s primary mission had been to guard two buildings that \u201cfrankly didn\u2019t need to be guarded.\u201d\nIn addition, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, also a Democrat, has questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws.\n\u201cI just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our Guard,\u201d she said Sunday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend.\u201d\nTrump deployed the Guard to Washington in his first term\nThis is also not the first time Trump unilaterally has chosen to use federal forces in the U.S. capital.\nIn 2020, during the protests over the police killing of George Floyd, Trump deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to the city, at one point using them to forcibly clear peaceful protesters from a square near the White House so he could stage a photo op.\nIt became a controversial moment in his first administration in part because Gen. Mark Milley, who was then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared alongside Trump. Some saw Milley\u2019s presence as the military\u2019s endorsement of using troops against U.S. citizens. Milley later apologized."

      "text": "Trump says he wants to deport \u2018the worst of the worst.\u2019 Government data tells another story\nPresident Donald Trump has pledged to deport \u201cthe worst of the worst.\u201d He frequently speaks at public appearances about the countless \u201cdangerous criminals\u201d \u2014 among them murderers, rapists and child predators \u2014 from around the world he says entered the U.S. illegally under the Biden administration. He promises to expel millions of migrants in the largest deportation program in American history to protect law-abiding citizens from the violent threats he says they pose.\nBut government data around ongoing detentions tells a different story.\nThere has been an increase of arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since Trump began his second term, with reports of raids across the country. Yet the majority of people currently detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. Of those who do, relatively few have been convicted of high-level crimes \u2014 a stark contrast to the chilling nightmare Trump describes to support his border security agenda.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a deep disconnect between the rhetoric and the reality,\u201d said Ahilan Arulanantham, co-faculty director of the UCLA Law School\u2019s Center for Immigration Law and Policy. \u201cThis administration, and also in the prior Trump administration, they consistently claim to be going after the worst of the worst and just talk about immigration enforcement as though it is all about going after violent, dangerous people with extensive criminal histories. And yet overwhelmingly, it\u2019s people they\u2019re targeting for arrest who have no criminal history of any kind.\u201d\nA look at the numbers\nThe latest ICE statistics show that as of June 29, there were 57,861 people detained by ICE, 41,495 \u2014 71.7% \u2014 of whom had no criminal convictions. That includes 14,318 people with pending criminal charges and 27,177 who are subject to immigration enforcement, but have no known criminal convictions or pending criminal charges.\nEach detainee is assigned a threat level by ICE on a scale of 1 to 3, with one being the highest. Those without a criminal record are classified as having \u201cno ICE threat level.\u201d As of June 23, the latest data available, 84% of people detained at 201 facilities nationwide were not given a threat level. Another 7% had been graded as a level 1 threat, 4% were level 2 and 5% were level 3.\n\u201cPresident Trump has justified this immigration agenda in part by making false claims that migrants are driving violent crime in the United States, and that\u2019s just simply not true,\u201d said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, senior director of the justice program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThere\u2019s no research and evidence that supports his claims.\u201d\nTricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, called the assessment that ICE isn\u2019t targeting immigrants with a criminal record \u201cfalse\u201d and said that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has directed ICE \u201cto target the worst of the worst\u2014including gang members, murderers, and rapists.\u201d She counted detainees with convictions, as well as those with pending charges, as \u201ccriminal illegal aliens.\u201d\nNonpublic data obtained by the Cato Institute shows that as of June 14, 65% of the more than 204,000 people processed into the system by ICE since the start of fiscal year 2025, which began Oct. 1, 2024, had no criminal convictions. Of those with convictions, only 6.9% had committed a violent crime, while 53% had committed nonviolent crimes that fell into three main categories \u2014 immigration, traffic, or vice crimes.\nTotal ICE arrests shot up at the end of May after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller gave the agency a quota of 3,000 arrests a day, up from 650 a day in the first five months of Trump\u2019s second term. ICE arrested nearly 30% more people in May than in April, according to the Transactional Records Clearinghouse, or TRAC. That number rose again in June, by another 28%.\nThe Cato Institute found that between Feb. 8 and May 17, the daily average of \u201cnoncriminals\u201d processed into the system ranged from 421 to 454. In the following two weeks at the end of May, that number rose to 678 and then rose to 927 in the period from June 1 through 14.\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is this huge increase in funding to detain people, remove people, enforce immigration laws,\u201d Eisen said. \u201cAnd what we\u2019re seeing is that a lot of these people back to sort of the original question you asked, these are not people who are dangerous.\u201d\nAdministration says focus is on dangerous criminals\nAbigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said the administration is intensely focused on rooting out unvetted criminals who are in the country illegally.\n\u201cJust this week, the Administration conducted a successful operation rescuing children from labor exploitation at a marijuana facility in California, and continued arresting the worst of the worst \u2013 including murderers, pedophiles, gang members, and rapists,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cAny suggestion that the Administration is not laser focused on these dangerous criminals is flat out wrong.\u201d\nWhile most ICE detainees are not convicted criminals, there are detainees who have committed serious crimes. On Friday, the administration released information on five high-level offenders who had been arrested.\nDuring his campaign, Trump highlighted several cases where immigrants in the country illegally were arrested for horrific crimes. Among them: The killing of 22-year-old Laken Riley, a Georgia nursing student who was slain last year by a Venezuelan man in the U.S. illegally. Jose Ibarra was found guilty of murder and other crimes in Riley\u2019s February 2024 killing and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Ibarra is seeking a new trial.\nTrump in January signed into law the Laken Riley Act, which requires the detention of unauthorized immigrants accused of theft and violent crimes.\nImmigrants are not driving violent crime in US, studies find\nResearch has consistently found, however, that immigrants are not driving violent crime in the U.S. and that they actually commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. A 2023 working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, for example, reported that immigrants for 150 years have had lower incarceration rates than those born in the U.S. In fact, the rates have declined since 1960 \u2014 according to the paper, immigrants were 60% less likely to be incarcerated.\nExperts say the false rhetoric coming out of the Trump administration creates real harm.\n\u201cIt makes people in immigrant communities feel targeted and marginalized,\u201d Arulanantham said. \u201cIt creates more political and social space for hate in all its forms, including hate crime against immigrant communities.\u201d\nEisen noted that the impact extends to other communities as well.\n\u201cAll Americans should want safe and thriving communities and this idea that the president of the United States is making misleading statements about the truth and distorting reality is not the way to deliver public safety,\u201d she said.\n___\nFind AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck."

      "text": "US and China extend trade truce another 90 days, easing tension between world\u2019s largest economies\nUS and China extend trade truce another 90 days, easing tension between world\u2019s largest economies\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump extended a trade truce with China for another 90 days Monday, at least delaying once again a dangerous showdown between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.\nTrump posted on his Truth Social platform that he signed the executive order for the extension, and that \u201call other elements of the Agreement will remain the same.\u201d Beijing at the same time also announced the extension of the tariff pause, according to the Ministry of Commerce.\nThe previous deadline was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. Had that happened the U.S. could have ratcheted up taxes on Chinese imports from an already high 30%, and Beijing could have responded by raising retaliatory levies on U.S. exports to China.\nThe pause buys time for the two countries to work out some of their differences, perhaps clearing the way for a summit later this year between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, and it has been welcomed by the U.S. companies doing business with China.\nSean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said the extension is \u201ccritical\u201d to give the two governments time to negotiate a trade agreement that U.S. businesses hope would improve their market access in China and provide the certainty needed for companies to make medium- and long-term plans.\n\u201cSecuring an agreement on fentanyl that leads to a reduction in U.S. tariffs and a rollback of China\u2019s retaliatory measures is acutely needed to restart U.S. agriculture and energy exports,\u201d Stein said.\nChina said Tuesday it would extend relief to American companies who were placed on an export control list and an unreliable entities list. After Trump initially announced tariffs in April, China restricted exports of dual-use goods to some American companies, while banning others from trading or investing in China. The Ministry of Commerce said it would stop those restrictions for some companies, while giving others another 90-day extension.\nReaching a pact with China remains unfinished business for Trump, who has already upended the global trading system by slapping double-digit taxes \u2013 tariffs \u2013 on almost every country on earth.\nThe European Union, Japan and other trading partners agreed to lopsided trade deals with Trump, accepting once unthinkably U.S. high tariffs (15% on Japanese and EU imports, for instance) to ward off something worse.\nTrump\u2019s trade policies have turned the United States from one of the most open economies in the world into a protectionist fortress. The average U.S. tariff has gone from around 2.5% at the start of the year to 18.6%, highest since 1933, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.\nBut China tested the limits of a U.S. trade policy built around using tariffs as a cudgel to beat concessions out of trading partners. Beijing had a cudgel of its own: cutting off or slowing access to its rare earths minerals and magnets \u2013 used in everything from electric vehicles to jet engines.\nIn June, the two countries reached an agreement to ease tensions. The United States said it would pull back export restrictions on computer chip technology and ethane, a feedstock in petrochemical production. And China agreed to make it easier for U.S. firms to get access to rare earths.\n\u201cThe U.S. has realized it does not have the upper hand,\u2019\u2019 said Claire Reade, senior counsel at Arnold & Porter and former assistant U.S. trade representative for China affairs.\nIn May, the U.S. and China had averted an economic catastrophe by reducing massive tariffs they\u2019d slapped on each other\u2019s products, which had reached as high as 145% against China and 125% against the U.S.\nThose triple-digit tariffs threatened to effectively end trade between the United States and China and caused a frightening sell-off in financial markets. In a May meeting in Geneva they agreed to back off and keep talking: America\u2019s tariffs went back down to a still-high 30% and China\u2019s to 10%.\nHaving demonstrated their ability to hurt each other, they\u2019ve been talking ever since.\n\u201cBy overestimating the ability of steep tariffs to induce economic concessions from China, the Trump administration has not only underscored the limits of unilateral U.S. leverage, but also given Beijing grounds for believing that it can indefinitely enjoy the upper hand in subsequent talks with Washington by threatening to curtail rare earth exports,\u2019' said Ali Wyne, a specialist in U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group. \u201cThe administration\u2019s desire for a trade d\u00e9tente stems from the self-inflicted consequences of its earlier hubris.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Washington and Beijing can reach a grand bargain over America\u2019s biggest grievances. Among these are lax Chinese protection of intellectual property rights and Beijing\u2019s subsidies and other industrial policies that, the Americans say, give Chinese firms an unfair advantage in world markets and have contributed to a massive U.S. trade deficit with China of $262 billion last year.\nReade doesn\u2019t expect much beyond limited agreements such as the Chinese saying they will buy more American soybeans and promising to do more to stop the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl and to allow the continued flow of rare-earth magnets.\nBut the tougher issues will likely linger, and \u201cthe trade war will continue grinding ahead for years into the future,\u2019\u2019 said Jeff Moon, a former U.S. diplomat and trade official who now runs the China Moon Strategies consultancy.\n___\nAssociated Press Staff Writers Josh Boak and Huizhong Wu contributed to this story."

      "text": "Trump\u2019s big bill is powering his mass deportations. Congress is starting to ask questions\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s border czar Tom Homan visited Capitol Hill just weeks after Inauguration Day, with other administration officials and a singular message: They needed money for the White House\u2019s border security and mass deportation agenda.\nBy summer, Congress delivered.\nThe Republican Party\u2019s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what\u2019s arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.\nThe staggering sum is powering the nation\u2019s sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation \u2014 the cornerstone of Trump\u2019s promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. Homeland Security confirmed over the weekend ICE is working to set up detention sites at certain military bases.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting them out at record numbers,\u201d Trump said at the White House bill signing ceremony. \u201cWe have an obligation to, and we\u2019re doing it.\u201d\nMoney flows, and so do questions\nThe crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories \u2014 almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \u2014 but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.\nAnd it\u2019s not just the big bill\u2019s fresh infusion of funds fueling the president\u2019s agenda of 1 million deportations a year.\nIn the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.\n\u201cYour agency is out of control,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.\nThe senator warned that Homeland Security would \u201cgo broke\u201d by July.\nNoem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.\nBut Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an \u201cindefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,\u201d often without approval from Congress.\nThis past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump\u2019s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\u201cWe write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,\u201d the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.\n\u201cWe respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department\u2019s plan to disburse OBBBA funding,\u201d they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.\nDHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee \u201cto honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated\u201d through the new law.\n\u201cICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,\u201d she said. \u201cThis process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.\u201d\nDeportations move deep into communities\nAll together, it\u2019s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy \u2014 enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.\nThe Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a \u201cwhole of government\u201d approach.\n\u201cThey\u2019re orienting this huge shift,\u201d Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves \u201cinward.\u201d\nThe flood of cash comes when Americans\u2019 views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a \u201cgood thing\u201d for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.\nAt the same time, Trump\u2019s approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.\nAmericans are watching images of often masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.\nA new era of detention centers\nDetention centers are being stood up, from \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and the proposed new \u201cSpeedway Slammer\u201d in Indiana. Flights are ferrying migrants not just home or to El Salvador\u2019s notorious mega-prison but far away to Africa and beyond.\nHoman has insisted in recent interviews those being detained and deported are the \u201cworst of the worst,\u201d and he dismissed as \u201cgarbage\u201d the reports showing many of those being removed have not committed violations beyond their irregular immigration status.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no safe haven here,\u201d Homan said recently outside the White House. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do exactly what President Trump has promised the American people he\u2019d do.\u201d\nBack in February, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were \u201cbegging for money.\u201d\nAs Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.\nBut Paul\u2019s proposal was quickly dismissed. He was among a handful of GOP lawmakers who joined all Democrats in voting against the final tax and spending cuts bill."

Overall, American households will see more income from the tax cuts in the legislation, including middle income households, but the largest benefit will go to the top 10% of earners.\nThe CBO\u2019s report comes as lawmakers are away from Washington, many taking their messages about the bill to voters. Republicans muscled the legislation \u2014 deemed \u201cthe big, beautiful bill\u201d by Trump \u2014 through Congress in July. Democrats all vehemently opposed the legislation, warning that its tax cuts and spending priorities would come at the expense of vital government aid programs and a ballooning national debt.\n\u201cThis really is a big, beautiful bill for billionaires, but for the poor and the working class in this country, you are actually poorer,\u201d said Rep. Brendan Boyle, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, in an MSNBC interview on Monday.\nChanges to eligibility for government food assistance under the law will impact millions of Americans, the CBO found. Roughly 2.4 million people won\u2019t be eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program under new work requirements for many recipients. Low-income Americans could also see their income reduced through further restrictions on food aid and other types of assistance included in the law.\nAlready, more than 10 million Americans are expected to lose health insurance by 2034 due to changes to Medicaid under the law.\nFollowing release of the report, Rep. Jason Smith, the Republican chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he took issue with CBO\u2019s methodology, repeating criticism he has made in the past.\n\u201cCBO has a troubled track record of getting its estimates incorrect and, like Democrats, is biased in favor of more federal spending and higher taxes,\u201d Smith said on social media. \u201cDon\u2019t buy it.\u201d\nRepublicans have been eager to sell the upsides of the legislation \u2014 arguing that the tax cuts will spur economic growth \u2014 while they are on a monthlong summer break from Washington. But those who have held townhalls in their home districts have often been greeted by an earful from voters and activists.\n\u201cTax the rich,\u201d the crowd in Lincoln, Neb. chanted last week as Republican Rep. Michael Flood attempted to defend the bill.\nStill, Trump has been undeterred.\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill is putting America First like never before, delivering huge savings for hardworking families, boosting our economy, and securing our borders,\u201d said White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson in a statement last week."

A look at the small office inflaming debate over Trump\u2019s tax bill\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A small government office with some 275 employees has found itself caught in the political crossfire as Congress debates President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cone big beautiful bill.\u201d\nThe Congressional Budget Office has projected that the legislation would increase federal deficits by about $2.4 trillion over 10 years. That\u2019s a problem for a Republican Congress that has spent much of the past four years criticizing former President Joe Biden and Democrats for the nation\u2019s rising debt levels.\nThe White House and Republican leaders in Congress are taking issue with CBO\u2019s findings. They say economic growth will be higher than the office is projecting, resulting in more revenue coming into government coffers. Meanwhile, Democrats are touting CBO\u2019s findings as evidence of the bill\u2019s failings.\nHere\u2019s a look at the office at the center of Washington\u2019s latest political tug-of-war.\nWhat is the CBO?\nLawmakers established the Congressional Budget Office more than 50 years ago to provide objective, impartial analysis to support the budget process. The CBO is required to produce a cost estimate for nearly every bill approved by a House or Senate committee and will weigh in earlier when asked to do so by lawmakers.\nIt also produces a report during each Congress on how to reduce the debt if lawmakers so choose, with each option including arguments for and against. Plus, it publishes detailed estimates when presidents make proposals that would affect mandatory spending, which includes programs such as Social Security and Medicare.\nLawmakers created the office to help Congress play a stronger role in budget matters, providing them with an alternative to the Office of Management and Budget, which is part of a Republican or Democratic administration, depending upon the president in office.\nIs the CBO partisan?\nCBO hires analysts based on their expertise, not political affiliation. Staff is expected to maintain objectivity and avoid political influence. In evaluating potential employees, the CBO says that for most positions it looks at whether that person would be perceived to be free from political bias.\nLike other federal employees, the CBO\u2019s staff is prohibited from making political contributions to members of Congress.\nThe CBO\u2019s director, Phillip Swagel, served in former Republican President George W. Bush\u2019s administration as an economic adviser and as an assistant secretary at the Treasury Department.\nHe was reappointed to a second term as CBO director in July 2023 by then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., upon the joint recommendation of the chairmen of the House and Senate Budget committees, one a Republican and the other a Democrat.\nWhy is the CBO being attacked now?\nThe stakes are incredibly high with Republicans looking to pass their massive tax cut and immigration bill by early July.\nOutside groups, Democrats and some Republicans are highlighting CBO\u2019s analysis that the bill will increase federal deficits by about $2.4 trillion over 10 years and leave 10.9 million more people uninsured in 2034.\nRepublicans spent much of Biden\u2019s presidency focused on curbing federal deficits. They don\u2019t want to be seen as contributing to the fiscal problem.\nGOP lawmakers say the CBO isn\u2019t giving enough credit to the economic growth the bill will create, to the point where it would be deficit-neutral in the long run, if not better.\n\u201cThe CBO assumes long-term GDP growth of an anemic 1.8% and that is absurd,\u201d said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. \u201cThe American economy is going to boom like never before after the \u2018One Big, Beautiful Bill\u2019 is passed.\u201d\nRepublicans began taking issue with the CBO even before Trump and the current Congress were sworn into office.\n\u201cCBO will always predict a dark future when Republicans propose tax relief \u2013 but the reality is never so dire,\u201d Rep. Jason Smith, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a December press release.\nRecently, House Speaker Mike Johnson has been taking digs at the office.\n\u201cThe CBO is notorious for getting things WRONG,\u201d he said in a Facebook post.\nWhat did CBO say about the tax cuts enacted in Trump\u2019s first term?\nIn April 2018, CBO said that tax receipts would total $27 trillion from fiscal years 2018 to 2024.\nReceipts came in about $1.5 trillion higher than the CBO projected. Republicans have seized on that discrepancy.\nBut the numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story. Some of the criticism of the CBO ignores the context of a global pandemic as the federal government rushed to prop the economy up with massive spending bills under both Trump and Biden.\nIn a blog post last December, Swagel pointed out three reasons for the higher revenues: The primary reason was the burst of inflation that began in March 2021 as the country was recovering from COVID. That burst of inflation, he said, led to about $900 billion more in revenue.\nThere was also an increase in economic activity in \u201cthe later years of the period\u201d adding $700 billion. Also, new tariffs added about $250 billion, with other legislation partially offsetting those three factors.\nHow CBO compares in its assessment\nThe CBO\u2019s projection for the Republican bill is similar to some outside groups estimates.\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says the bill would add nearly $3 trillion to the debt through 2034 when including interest payments. That number rises to $5 trillion if some of the temporary provisions, such as no tax on tips and overtime, are made permanent.\nThe nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model, which conducts economic analysis of public policy issues, estimated the House-passed bill increases deficits by $2.8 trillion over 10 years. That number rises to $3.2 when using dynamic scoring to measure the bill\u2019s macroeconomic effects."

As President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the District of Columbia National Guard, it is my solemn duty to protect law-abiding citizens from the destructive forces of criminal activity. That obligation applies with special force in our Nation\u2019s capital, where, as Commander in Chief of the District of Columbia National Guard, I must also ensure that all citizens can avail themselves of the right to interact with their elected representatives, and that the Federal Government can properly function, without fear of being subjected to violent, menacing street crime.\nThe local government of the District of Columbia has lost control of public order and safety in the city, as evidenced by the two embassy staffers who were murdered in May, the Congressional intern who was fatally shot a short distance from the White House in June, and the Administration staffer who was mercilessly beaten by a violent mob days ago. Citizens, tourists, and staff alike are unable to live peacefully in the Nation\u2019s capital, which is under siege from violent crime. It is a point of national disgrace that Washington, D.C., has a violent crime rate that is higher than some of the most dangerous places in the world. It is my duty to our citizens and Federal workers to secure the safety and the peaceful functioning of our Nation, the Federal Government, and our city.\nSec. 2. Mobilizing the District of Columbia National Guard. Pursuant to my authority under the Constitution and laws of the United States and the District of Columbia, I direct the Secretary of Defense to mobilize the District of Columbia National Guard and order members to active service, in such numbers as he deems necessary, to address the epidemic of crime in our Nation\u2019s capital. The mobilization and duration of duty shall remain in effect until I determine that conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia. Further, I direct the Secretary of Defense to coordinate with State Governors and authorize the orders of any additional members of the National Guard to active service, as he deems necessary and appropriate, to augment this mission.\nSec. 3. General Provisions. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

Here\u2019s what the law says\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump took unprecedented steps toward federalizing Washington, D.C. on Monday, saying it\u2019s needed to fight crime even as city leaders pointed to data showing violence is down.\nHe took command of the police department and deployed the National Guard under laws and Constitutional powers that give the federal government more sway over the nation\u2019s capital than other cities. Its historically majority Black population wasn\u2019t electing its own city council and mayor until 1973, when Republican President Richard Nixon signed the Home Rule Act.\nThe measure still left significant power to the president and Congress, though no president has exercised the police powers before.\nHe activated the National Guard\nThe Constitution calls for the creation of the District of Columbia to serve as the federal seat of power under the jurisdiction of Congress rather than any state.\nWhile the Home Rule Act allowed for greater local control, the president can still call up the National Guard in Washington. His administration did it during Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, when members were later faulted for flying a helicopter too low over a crowd. The Guard was called out again during Trump\u2019s first term on Jan. 6, 2021, when his supporters overran the Capitol.\nTrump\u2019s second-term moves in Washington come as the legal battle continues over his deployment of the National Guard in another Democratic-led city, Los Angeles, despite the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom.\nHis authority is less clear there, but an appeals court has so far refused to intervene. A lower-court judge was starting a trial Monday to determine whether the deployment violated another federal law.\nHe took over the police\nSection 740 of the Home Rule Act allows for the president to take over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department for 48 hours, with possible extensions to 30 days, during times of emergencies. No president has done so before, said Monica Hopkins, executive director of the ACLU of Washington.\nTrump cited a number of recent high-profile incidents, including the killing of a 21-year-old congressional intern and the beating of a DOGE staffer during an attempted carjacking.\n\u201cThis is liberation day in D.C. and we\u2019re going to take our Capitol back,\u201d the president said.\nThe Democratic mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, called the takeover \u201cunprecedented.\u201d She said that violent crime overall in Washington has decreased to a 30-year low, after a rise in 2023. Carjackings, for example, dropped about 50% in 2024, and are down again this year. More than half of those arrested, however, are juveniles, and the extent of those punishments is a point of contention for the Trump administration.\nHe didn\u2019t specify how long it would last\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear how long the takeover might last or exactly what it might mean. It could also face challenges in court.\nCongress still has power over things like the budget and laws passed by the city council, but would have to repeal the Home Rule Act to expand federal power in the district.\nIt\u2019s something a few Republican lawmakers have pushed to do, but such an overhaul would almost certainly run into steep resistance from most Democrats, making it difficult to achieve.\nThe law is specific to D.C., and doesn\u2019t affect other communities around the U.S. referred to as having their own \u201chome rule\u201d powers in relationship to their state governments.\nHopkins said Trump\u2019s moves in Washington could foreshadow similar tactics in other cities. \u201cThat should alarm everyone,\u201d she said, \u201cnot just in Washington.\u201d"

The Senate passed the bill Tuesday, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaking vote. The House passed an earlier iteration of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. It passed the final version Thursday 218-214.\nHere\u2019s the latest on what\u2019s in the bill and when some of its provisions go into effect.\nGOP bill includes reductions for businesses and new tax breaks\nRepublicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump\u2019s first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.\nThe existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill, solidifying the tax cuts approved in Trump\u2019s first term.\nIt temporarily would add new tax deductions on tip, overtime and auto loans. There\u2019s also a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year, a nod to his pledge to end taxes on Social Security benefits.\nIt would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.\nA cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It\u2019s a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.\nThere are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research. Proponents say this will boost economic growth.\nThe wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, and the bill would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, mainly due to reductions in Medicaid and food aid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House\u2019s version.\nGOP bill funds the border wall, deportations and a missile shield\nThe bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump\u2019s border and national security agenda, including for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.\nMoney would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.\nTo help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.\nFor the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.\nMedicaid, SNAP face deep cuts to fund bill\u2019s tax breaks and spending\nTo help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for people below the poverty line.\nRepublicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.\nThe package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program\u2019s work requirements.\nThere\u2019s also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.\nMore than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.\nRepublicans are looking to have states pick up some of the cost for SNAP benefits. Currently, the federal government funds all benefit costs. Under the bill, states beginning in 2028 will be required to contribute a set percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. Payment errors include both underpayments and overpayments.\nBut the Senate bill temporarily delays the start date of that cost-sharing for states with the highest SNAP error rates. Alaska has the highest error rate in the nation at nearly 25%, according to Department of Agriculture data. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had fought for the exception. She was a decisive vote in getting the bill through the Senate.\nThe \u2018big beautiful\u2019 bill slashes clean energy tax credits\nRepublicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden\u2019s 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering health care costs.\nDemocratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a \u201cdeath sentence for America\u2019s wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.\u201d\nA tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.\nMeanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.\nThe bill creates \u2018Trump Accounts\u2019 \u2014 and funds a national hero garden\nA number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.\nThe bill creates a new children\u2019s savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.\nThe Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump\u2019s long-sought \u201cNational Garden of American Heroes.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a new excise tax on university endowments and a new tax on remittances, or transfers of money that people in the U.S. send abroad. The tax is equal to 1% of the transfer.\nA $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated.\nOne provision bars for one year Medicaid payments to family planning providers that provide abortions, namely Planned Parenthood.\nAnother section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.\nBillions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for the exploration of Mars, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.\nAdditionally, a provision would increase the nation\u2019s debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.\nState AI regulations cut from bill after a GOP uproar\nThe Senate overwhelmingly revolted against a proposal meant to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence. Republican governors across the country asked for the moratorium to be removed and the Senate voted to do so with a resounding 99-1 vote.\nA provision was thrown in at the final hours that will provide $10 billion annually to rural hospitals for five years, or $50 billion in total. The Senate bill had originally provided $25 billion for the program, but that number was upped to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that reduced Medicaid provider taxes would hurt rural hospitals.\nThe amended bill also stripped out a new tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China.\nFinal price tag: GOP bill could add $3.3 trillion to deficit\nAltogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034.\nOr not, depending on how one does the math.\nSenate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already \u201ccurrent policy.\u201d Republican senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.\nUnder the alternative Senate GOP view, the bill would reduce deficits by almost half a trillion dollars over the coming decade, the CBO said.\nDemocrats say this is \u201cmagic math\u201d that obscures the true costs of the tax breaks. Some nonpartisan groups worried about the country\u2019s fiscal trajectory are siding with Democrats in that regard. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans were employing an \u201caccounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.\u201d\n___"

(AP) \u2014 Federal immigration authorities said Friday they arrested about 200 immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally in raids a day earlier on two California cannabis farm sites. Protesters engaged in a tense standoff with authorities during an operation at one of the farms.\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that authorities executed criminal search warrants in Carpinteria and Camarillo, California, on Thursday. They arrested immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally, and there were also at least 10 immigrant children on site, the statement said.\nFour U.S. citizens were arrested for \u201cassaulting or resisting officers,\u201d the department said. Authorities were offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of one person suspected of firing a gun at federal agents. One worker who called family to say he was hiding from authorities was on life support after falling and suffering significant injuries.\nDuring the raid, crowds of people gathered outside Glass House Farms in Camarillo to seek information about their relatives and protest immigration enforcement. Authorities clad in military-style helmets and uniforms faced off with the demonstrators. Acrid green and white billowing smoke then forced community members to retreat.\nGlass House, a licensed California cannabis grower, said in a statement that immigration agents had valid warrants. The company said workers were detained, and it is helping provide them with legal representation. The farm also grows tomatoes and cucumbers.\n\u201cGlass House has never knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors,\u201d the statement said.\nIt is legal to grow and sell cannabis in California with proper licensing.\nThe state\u2019s Department of Cannabis Control said they \u201cobserved no minors on the premises\u201d during a site visit to the farm in May 2025. After receiving another complaint, the department opened an active investigation, according to a department spokesperson.\nWorker gravely injured\nAt least 12 people were injured during the raid and protest, said Andrew Dowd, a spokesperson for the Ventura County Fire Department. Eight were taken to St. John\u2019s Regional Medical Center and the Ventura County Medical Center, and four were treated at the scene and released. Dowd said he did not have information on the extent of the injuries of those hospitalized.\nOn Friday, about two dozen people waited outside the farm to retrieve the cars of loved ones and speak to managers. Relatives of Jaime Alanis, who has picked tomatoes at the farm for 10 years, said he called his wife in Mexico during the raid to tell her immigration agents had arrived and that he was hiding with others inside the farm.\n\u201cThe next thing we heard was that he was in the hospital with broken hands, ribs and a broken neck,\u201d Juan Duran, Alanis\u2019 brother-in-law, said in Spanish.\nIt was not immediately clear how Alanis was injured. A doctor at Ventura County Medical Center told the family that those who brought Alanis to the hospital said he had fallen from the roof of a building.\nAlanis had a broken neck, fractured skull and a rupture in an artery that pumps blood to the brain, said his niece Yesenia, who didn\u2019t want to share her last name for fear of reprisal. He is on life support, she said.\n\u201cThey told us he won\u2019t make it and to say goodbye,\u201d Yesenia said, crying.\nThe hospital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nConfrontation with authorities\nRelatives and advocates headed to the farm about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of downtown Los Angeles to try to find out what was going on, and began protesting outside.\nFederal authorities formed a line blocking the road leading through farm fields to the company\u2019s greenhouses. Protesters were seen shouting at agents wearing camouflage gear, helmets and gas masks. The billowing smoke drove protesters to retreat. It wasn\u2019t clear why authorities threw the canisters or if they released chemicals such as tear gas.\nVentura County fire authorities responding to a 911 call of people having trouble breathing said three people were taken to nearby hospitals.\nAt the farm, agents arrested workers and removed them by bus. Others, including U.S. citizens, were detained at the site for hours while agents investigated.\nThe incident came as federal immigration agents have ramped up arrests in Southern California at car washes, farms and Home Depot parking lots, stoking widespread fear among immigrant communities.\nFederal investigations\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Friday that the investigation into immigration and potential child labor violations at the farm is ongoing. No further details of the allegations were provided.\nThe agency said hundreds of demonstrators attempted to disrupt the operations, leading to the arrest of four Americans.\n\u201cWe will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who assaults or doxes federal law enforcement,\u201d Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection were both part of the operation, the statement said.\nPresident Donald Trump said he has ordered DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and White House border czar Tom Homan to direct ICE agents to use \u201cwhatever means is necessary\u201d going forward when dealing with violent protesters.\n\u201cI am giving Total Authorization for ICE to protect itself, just like they protect the Public,\u201d Trump said in a social media posting Friday evening.\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson in a statement blamed \u201cviolent leftists\u201d and Democrats for the Camarillo incident and other assaults on ICE agents in recent weeks.\nFamily members search for answers\nThe mother of an American worker said her son was held at the worksite for 11 hours and told her agents took workers\u2019 cellphones to prevent them from calling family or filming and forced them to erase cellphone video of agents at the site.\nThe woman said her son told her agents marked the men\u2019s hands with ink to distinguish their immigration status. She spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because she feared reprisals from the government.\nUnited Farm Workers said in statement that some U.S. citizens are not yet accounted for.\nMaria Servin, 68, said her son has worked at the farm for 18 years and was helping to build a greenhouse. She said she spoke to her son, who is undocumented, after hearing of the raid and offered to pick him up.\n\u201cHe said not to come because they were surrounded and there was even a helicopter. That was the last time I spoke to him,\u201d Servin, a U.S. citizen, said in Spanish.\nShe said she went to the farm anyway but federal agents were shooting tear gas and rubber bullets and she decided it was not safe to stay. She and her daughter returned to the farm Friday and were told her son had been arrested Thursday. They still don\u2019t know where he is being held.\n\u201cI regret 1,000 times that I didn\u2019t help him get his documents,\u201d Servin said.\n_____\nTaxin reported from Orange County, California, and Rodriguez reported from San Francisco."

But it also pours some $300 billion to beef up the Pentagon and border security as the Trump administration says it\u2019s running out of money for deportations.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing to have the bill wrapped up by Memorial Day and then send it to the Senate, which is drafting its own version.\n\u201cWe are on track,\u201d Johnson, R-La., said at his weekly press conference.\nThis was always expected to be the hard part, where Republicans who have control of the House and Senate begin to fill in the difficult details of what, until now, has simply been a framework for Trump\u2019s tax package at the cornerstone of the GOP\u2019s domestic agenda.\nAs Trump rounds his 100th day in office, the GOP\u2019s stiff immigration provisions come as Americans are showing unease with the president\u2019s approach, with just half saying he\u2019s focused on the right priorities. The White House is battling high-profile court cases after it mistakenly deported a Maryland man to El Salvador and, over the weekend, Trump\u2019s team rounded up countless immigrants, including foreign-born parents who were deported with their American-born toddlers and small children in tow.\nDemocrats are fighting back in the House and Senate, and the halls of public opinion, but as the minority party in Congress, they have little ability to stop the forward march of the package.\nInstead, they used Tuesday\u2019s hearings to try to shame Republicans into rethinking their approach.\n\u201cDo a little soul searching before you vote for this,\u201d said Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, at one point during the debate.\nBuilding the US-Mexico border wall and hiring bonuses for officers\nCentral to the Homeland Committee\u2019s section of the legislation is $46.5 billion to revive construction of Trump\u2019s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, with some 700 miles of \u201cprimary\u201d wall, 900 miles of river barriers, and more.\nThere\u2019s also $4 billion to hire an additional 3,000 new Border Patrol agents as well as 5,000 new customs officers, and $2.1 billion for signing and retention bonuses.\nDemocrats kept the committee in session for hours, submitting some three dozen amendments to change the package. They all failed.\nAmong the first Democratic amendments offered was from Rep. Troy Carter of Louisiana to prohibit the use of funding to deport American children. Another from Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island would stop the money from being used to send Americans to foreign prisons.\n\u201cWhat world are we living in?\u201d Magaziner asked.\nHe said allowing Republicans to \u201ckeep trampling on rights, soon everyone\u2019s rights\u201d will be under threat.\nChairman Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., as he gaveled the committee open, said, \u201cIt is critical that the Republican majority do what the people elected us to do.\u201d\nThe committee approved its bill on a party line vote.\nGOP goals: 1 million deportations, 100,000 detention beds \u2014 including for families and children\nFor the first time, the U.S. under the legislation would impose a $1,000 fee on migrants seeking asylum \u2014 something the nation has never done.\nExperts said the new fee on asylum seekers would put the U.S. on par with a few others, including Australia and Iran.\nAnd that\u2019s not all. The Judiciary Committee is expected to meet Wednesday on its $110 billion section of the package.\nThere would be new fees on various other legal paths to entry, including a $3,500 fee for those sponsoring unaccompanied children to enter the U.S., a $2,500 penalty if sponsors of unaccompanied children skip court appearances and a $1,000 fee for individuals paroled into the U.S.\nOverall, the plan is to remove 1 million immigrants annually and house 100,000 people in detention centers. It calls for 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and investigators.\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth comes under fire\nMeanwhile, the House Armed Services Committee started drilling down Tuesday into its section of the package, with some $100 billion in new spending, including some $5 billion for border security.\nBut the hearing became tangled by questions from Democrats over funding for Ukraine, Trump\u2019s plan for a big military parade and calls for Hegseth to be fired or resign.\nRep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., a veteran herself, offered an amendment that would prohibit the provisions from going into effect until Hegseth \u201cis no longer Secretary of Defense.\u201d\nDemocratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a combat veteran, had an amendment to prevent money on Trump\u2019s parade, which is planned for June in Washington, saying there shouldn\u2019t be a military parade for a \u201cdraft dodger,\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s medical deferral from Vietnam War-era service.\nAnd Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., proposed halting any money for a make-up studio for the Pentagon secretary. It was reported that Hegseth, a former Fox News host, sought such a room for his appearances.\nHours later, the Republican-led panel wrapped up and approved its bill.\nTax breaks, spending cuts still to come\nOther portions of the GOP legislation are still a work in progress, including the provisions on tax breaks for individual filers, and spending cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and other programs.\nThose proposals are expected to be unveiled next week, though that timeline could slip. Once the nearly dozen committees wrap up their work, the entire package will be assembled into the \u201cbig\u201d bill for a final vote in the House. And then it\u2019s sent to the Senate.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Leah Askarinam contributed to this report."

      "text": "Trial starts over Trump administration\u2019s deployment of National Guard to Los Angeles\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles field office director for the Department of Homeland Security testified on Monday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers desperately needed the help of military personnel in carrying out arrests. The question is whether President Donald Trump \u2018s deployment of armed forces goes against U.S. law that generally prohibits the president from using the military to police domestic affairs.\nErnesto Santacruz Jr. testified at the start of a three-day trial in San Francisco over whether Trump\u2019s administration violated the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act when it deployed National Guard soldiers and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles following June protests over immigration raids. The administration has argued federal military are allowed to protect federal property and federal agents.\nSantacruz said before the deployment, he received multiple reports daily of attacks on his officers.\nAfter the deployment, he said, \u201cWe still had officer assault situations, but they did reduce drastically.\u201d\nTrump has pushed the bounds of typical military activity on domestic soil, including through the creation of militarized zones along the U.S.-Mexico border. On Monday, the president said he was deploying the National Guard across Washington, D.C., and taking over the city\u2019s police department in hopes of reducing crime, even as the mayor has noted crime is falling in the nation\u2019s capital.\nThe trial could set precedent for how Trump can deploy the guard in the future in California or other states.\nThe Trump administration federalized California National Guard members and sent them to the second-largest U.S. city over the objections of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and city leaders after protests erupted June 7 when ICE officers arrested people at multiple locations.\nThe Department of Defense ordered the deployment of roughly 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles. Most of the troops have since left but 250 National Guard members remain, according to the latest figures provided by the Pentagon.\nCalifornia is asking Judge Charles Breyer to order the Trump administration to return control of the remaining troops to the state and to stop the federal government from using military troops in California \u201cto execute or assist in the execution of federal law or any civilian law enforcement functions by any federal agent or officer.\u201d\nTrump federalized members of the California National Guard under a law that allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country \u201cis invaded,\u201d when \u201cthere is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,\u201d or when the president is otherwise unable \u201cto execute the laws of the United States.\u201d\nBreyer found the protests in Los Angeles \u201cfall far short of \u2018rebellion.\u2019\u201d\nWitnesses called by the state of California testified Monday as to what the deployed forces could and could not do.\nMaj. Gen. Scott Sherman said personnel were authorized, in certain situations, to carry out some law enforcement actions, such as setting up a security perimeter outside of federal facilities and detaining civilians for police arrest.\nBreyer, who was nominated to the bench by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, appeared skeptical of the federal government\u2019s arguments.\nBreyer handed Newsom an early victory when the judge found the Trump administration violated the Constitution\u2019s 10th Amendment, which defines power between federal and state governments, and exceeded its authority.\nThe Trump administration immediately appealed, arguing that courts can\u2019t second guess the president\u2019s decisions. It secured a temporary halt allowing control of the California National Guard to stay in federal hands as the lawsuit unfolds.\nAfter their deployment, the guard members accompanied federal immigration officers on raids in Los Angeles and at two marijuana farm sites in Ventura County while Marines mostly stood guard around a federal building in downtown Los Angeles that includes a detention center at the core of protests.\nSince June, federal agents have rounded up immigrants without legal status to be in the U.S. from Home Depots, car washes, bus stops, and farms. Some U.S. citizens have also been detained."

      "text": "Trump signs his tax and spending cut bill at the White House July 4 picnic\nTrump signs his tax and spending cut bill at the White House July 4 picnic\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump signed his package of tax breaks and spending cuts into law Friday in front of Fourth of July picnickers after his cajoling produced almost unanimous Republican support in Congress for the domestic priority that could cement his second-term legacy.\nFlanked by Republican legislators and members of his Cabinet, Trump signed the multitrillion-dollar legislation at a desk on the White House driveway, then banged down a gavel gifted to him by House Speaker Mike Johnson that was used during the bill\u2019s final passage Thursday.\nAgainst odds that at times seemed improbable, Trump achieved his goal of celebrating a historic \u2014 and divisive \u2014 legislative victory in time for the nation\u2019s birthday, which also was his self-imposed deadline for Congress to send the legislation to his desk. Fighter jets and stealth bombers streaked through the sky over the annual White House Fourth of July picnic.\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s winning, winning, winning like never before,\u201d Trump said, noting last month\u2019s bombing campaign against Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which he said the flyover was meant to honor. \u201cPromises made, promises kept, and we\u2019ve kept them.\u201d\nThe White House was hung with red, white and blue bunting for the Independence Day festivities. The U.S. Marine Band played patriotic marches \u2014 and, in a typical Trumpian touch, tunes by 1980s pop icons Chaka Khan and Huey Lewis. There were three separate flyovers.\nTrump spoke for a relatively brief 22 minutes before signing the bill, but was clearly energized as the legislation\u2019s passage topped a recent winning streak for his administration. That included the Iran campaign and a series of U.S. Supreme Court rulingshe\u2019s fought for.\nAfter dark, chants of \u201cUSA, USA\u201d rose from the picnic crowd on the South Lawn when Trump and the first lady, Melania, appeared on the Truman Balcony to watch the fireworks. They danced to \u201cY.M.C.A.\u201d and waved goodbye to the crowd before they left for their home in New Jersey.\nThe budget legislation is the president\u2019s highest-profile win yet. It includes key campaign pledges like no tax on tips or Social Security income. Trump, who spent an unusual amount of time thanking individual Republican lawmakers who shepherded the measure through Congress, contended \u201cour country is going to be a rocket ship, economically,\u201d because of the legislation.\nBig cuts to Medicaid and food stamps\nCritics assailed the package as a giveaway to the rich that will rob millions more lower-income people of their health insurance, food assistance and financial stability.\n\u201cToday, Donald Trump signed into law the worst job-killing bill in American history. It will rip health care from 17 million workers to pay for massive tax giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations, amounting to the country\u2019s largest money grab from the working class to the ultra-rich,\u201d AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in a statement. \u201cEvery member of Congress who voted for this devastating bill picked the pockets of working people to hand billionaires a $5 trillion gift.\u201d\nThe legislation extends Trump\u2019s 2017 multitrillion-dollar tax cuts and cuts Medicaid and food stamps by $1.2 trillion. It provides for a massive increase in immigration enforcement. Congress\u2019 nonpartisan scorekeeper projects that nearly 12 million more people will lose health insurance under the law.\nThe legislation passed the House on a largely party-line vote Thursday, culminating a monthslong push by the GOP to cram most of its legislative priorities into a single budget bill that could be enacted without Senate Democrats being able to block it indefinitely by filibustering.\nIt passed by a single vote in the Senate, where North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis announced he would not run for reelection after incurring Trump\u2019s wrath in opposing it. Vance had to cast the tie-breaking vote.\nIn the House, where two Republicans voted against it, one, conservative maverick Tom Massie of Kentucky, has also become a target of Trump\u2019s well-funded political operation. No Democrats voted for the bill.\nThe legislation amounts to a repudiation of the agendas of the past two Democratic presidents, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, in rolling back Obama\u2019s Medicaid expansion under his signature health law and Biden\u2019s tax credits for renewable energy.\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the decade and 11.8 million more people will go without health coverage.\nDemocrats vow to make bill a midterm issue\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin on Friday called the bill \u201cdevastating\u201d and said in a statement that Trump\u2019s signature on the legislation \u201csealed the fate of the Republican Party, cementing them as the party for billionaires and special interests \u2014 not working families.\u201d\nHe predicted Republicans would lose their majority in Congress over it. \u201cThis was a full betrayal of the American people,\u201d Martin said.\nTrump complained Friday about Democrats opposing the bill, \u201cand we knew that because their hatred of either the country or me or both is so great they didn\u2019t vote at all and it\u2019s terrible.\u201d\nHe said their \u201cstandard line\u201d is to say Republican legislation is \u201cdangerous\u201d or \u201ceverybody\u2019s going to die\u201d and \u201cwe can\u2019t let them get away with it.\u201d With his bill, Trump said, \u201cit\u2019s actually just the opposite, everybody\u2019s going to live.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I just want you to know, if you see anything negative put out by Democrats, it\u2019s all a con job,\u201d Trump said, defending a package that now is law.\nSpeaking in Iowa on Thursday night, Trump said Democrats \u201chate Trump \u2014 but I hate them, too.\u201d\nThe package is certain to be a flashpoint in next year\u2019s midterm elections, and Democrats are making ambitious plans for rallies, voter registration drives, attack ads, bus tours and even a multiday vigil, all intended to highlight the most controversial elements.\nUpon his return to Washington early Friday, Trump described the package as \u201cvery popular,\u201d though polling suggests that public opinion is mixed at best.\nFor example, a Washington Post/Ipsos poll found that majorities of U.S. adults support increasing the annual child tax credit and eliminating taxes on earnings from tips, and about half support work requirements for some adults who receive Medicaid.\nBut the poll found majorities oppose reducing federal funding for food assistance to low-income families and spending about $45 billion to build and maintain migrant detention centers. About 60% said it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d that the bill is expected to increase the $36 trillion U.S. debt by more than $3 trillion over the next decade."

(AP video: Eugene Garcia)\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 At a federal immigration building in downtown Los Angeles guarded by U.S. Marines, daughters, sons, aunts, nieces and others make their way to an underground garage and line up at a door with a buzzer at the end of a dirty, dark stairwell.\nIt\u2019s here where families, some with lawyers, come to find their loved ones after they\u2019ve been arrested by federal immigration agents.\nFor immigrants without legal status who are detained in this part of Southern California, their first stop is the Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in the basement of the federal building. Officers verify their identity and obtain their biometrics before transferring them to detention facilities. Upstairs, immigrants line up around the block for other services, including for green cards and asylum applications.\nOn a recent day, dozens of people arrived with medication, clothing and hope of seeing their loved one, if only briefly. After hours of waiting, many were turned away with no news, not even confirmation that their relative was inside. Some relayed reports of horrific conditions inside, including inmates who are so thirsty that they have been drinking from the toilets. ICE did not respond to emailed requests for comment.\nJust two weeks ago, protesters marched around the federal complex following aggressive raids in Los Angeles that began June 6 and have not stopped. Scrawled expletives about President Donald Trump still mark the complex\u2019s walls.\nThose arrested are from a variety of countries, including Mexico, Guatemala, India, Iran, China and Laos. About a third of the county\u2019s 10 million residents are foreign-born.\nMany families learned about the arrests from videos circulating on social media showing masked officers in parking lots at Home Depots, at car washes and in front of taco stands.\nAround 8 a.m., when attorney visits begin, a few lawyers buzz the basement door called \u201cB-18\u201d as families wait anxiously outside to hear any inkling of information.\n9 a.m.\nChristina Jimenez and her cousin arrive to check if her 61-year-old stepfather is inside.\nHer family had prepared for the possibility of this happening to the day laborer who would wait to be hired outside a Home Depot in the LA suburb of Hawthorne. They began sharing locations when the raids intensified. They told him that if he were detained, he should stay silent and follow instructions.\nJimenez had urged him to stop working, or at least avoid certain areas as raids increased. But he was stubborn and \u201calways hustled.\u201d\n\u201cHe could be sick and he\u2019s still trying to make it out to work,\u201d Jimenez said.\nAfter learning of his arrest, she looked him up online on the ICE Detainee Locator but couldn\u2019t find him. She tried calling ICE to no avail.\nTwo days later, her phone pinged with his location downtown.\n\u201cMy mom\u2019s in shock,\u201d Jimenez said. \u201cShe goes from being very angry to crying, same with my sister.\u201d\nJimenez says his name into the intercom \u2013 Mario Alberto Del Cid Solares. After a brief wait, she is told yes, he\u2019s there.\nShe and her cousin breathe a sigh of relief \u2014 but their questions remain.\nHer biggest fear is that instead of being sent to his homeland of Guatemala, he will be deported to another country, something the Supreme Court recently ruled was allowed.\n9:41 a.m.\nBy mid-morning, Estrella Rosas and her mother have come looking for her sister, Andrea Velez, a U.S. citizen. A day earlier, they saw Velez being detained after they dropped her off at her marketing job at a shoe company downtown.\n\u201cMy mom told me to call 911 because someone was kidnapping her,\u201d Rosas said.\nStuck on a one-way street, they had to circle the block. By the time they got back, she says they saw Velez in handcuffs being put into a car without license plates.\nVelez\u2019s family believes she was targeted for looking Hispanic and standing near a tamale stand.\nRosas has her sister\u2019s passport and U.S. birth certificate, but learns she is not there. They find her next door in a federal detention center. She was accused of obstructing immigration officers, which the family denies, but is released the next day.\n11:40 a.m.\nAbout 20 people are now outside. Some have found cardboard to sit on after waiting hours.\nOne family comforts a woman who is crying softly in the stairwell.\nThen the door opens, and a group of lawyers emerge. Families rush to ask if the attorneys could help them.\nKim Carver, a lawyer with the Trans Latino Coalition, says she planned to see her client, a transgender Honduran woman, but she was transferred to a facility in Texas at 6:30 that morning.\nCarver accompanied her less than a week ago for an immigration interview and the asylum officer told her she had a credible case. Then ICE officers walked in and detained her.\n\u201cSince then, it\u2019s been just a chase trying to find her,\u201d she says.\n12:28 p.m.\nAs more people arrive, the group begins sharing information. One person explains the all-important \u201cA-number,\u201d the registration number given to every detainee, which is needed before an attorney can help.\nThey exchange tips like how to add money to an account for phone calls. One woman says $20 lasted three or four calls for her.\nMayra Segura is looking for her uncle after his frozen popsicle cart was abandoned in the middle of the sidewalk in Culver City.\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t find him in the system,\u201d she says.\n12:52 p.m.\nAnother lawyer, visibly frustrated, comes out the door. She\u2019s carrying bags of clothes, snacks, Tylenol, and water that she says she wasn\u2019t allowed to give to her client, even though he says he had been given only one water bottle over the past two days.\nThe line stretches outside the stairwell into the sun. A man leaves and returns with water for everyone.\nNearly an hour after family visitations are supposed to begin, people are finally allowed in.\n2:12 p.m.\nStill wearing hospital scrubs from work, Jasmin Camacho Picazo comes to see her husband again.\nShe brought a sweater because he had told her he was cold, and his back injury was aggravated from sleeping on the ground.\n\u201cHe mentioned this morning (that) people were drinking from the restroom toilet water,\u201d Picazo says.\nOn her phone, she shows footage of his car left on the side of the road after his arrest. The window was smashed and the keys were still in the ignition.\n\u201cI can\u2019t stop crying,\u201d Picazo says.\nHer son keeps asking: \u201cIs Papa going to pick me up from school?\u201d\n2:21 p.m.\nMore than five hours after Jimenez and her cousin arrive, they see her stepfather.\n\u201cHe was sad and he\u2019s scared,\u201d says Jimenez afterwards. \u201cWe tried to reassure him as much as possible.\u201d\nShe wrote down her phone number, which he had not memorized, so he could call her.\n2:57 p.m.\nMore people arrive as others are let in.\nYadira Almadaz comes out crying after seeing her niece\u2019s boyfriend for only five minutes. She says he was in the same clothes he was wearing when he was detained a week ago at an asylum appointment in the city of Tustin. He told her he\u2019d only been given cookies and chips to eat each day.\n\u201cIt breaks my heart seeing a young man cry because he\u2019s hungry and thirsty,\u201d she says.\n3:56 p.m.\nFour minutes before visitation time is supposed to end, an ICE officer opens the door and announces it\u2019s over.\nOne woman snaps at him in frustration. The officer tells her he would get in trouble if he helped her past 4 p.m.\nMore than 20 people are still waiting in line. Some trickle out. Others linger, staring at the door in disbelief."

The icing on the cake: a promise of up to $50,000 in signing bonuses.\nThe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement campaign, which rolled out late Tuesday, recalls recruiting posters from World War II with images of Uncle Sam and the words \u201cAMERICA NEEDS YOU.\u201d There also are photos of Trump and top homeland security officials with the words \u201cDEFEND THE HOMELAND\u201d across the images.\n\u201cYour country is calling you to serve at ICE,\u201d said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a news release. \u201cThis is a defining moment in our nation\u2019s history. Your skills, your experience, and your courage have never been more essential. Together, we must defend the homeland.\u201d\nIn addition to appealing to prospective applicants\u2019 patriotic fervor, Homeland Security is making a pocketbook pitch. The agency is promising up to $50,000 in signing bonuses, the potential for lots of overtime for deportation officers and other benefits such as loan repayment or forgiveness options.\nLots of money is coming to ICE\nAll of this is made possible by a big infusion of money to ICE.\nThe package of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law this month includes about $170 billion for border security and immigration enforcement, spread out over five years.\nICE is set to get $76.5 billion, nearly 10 times its current annual budget. Some $45 billion will go toward increasing detention capacity. Nearly $30 billion is for hiring 10,000 more staff so the agency can meet its goal of 1 million annual deportations.\nNew hires include deportation officers responsible for tracking down, arresting and removing people who the administration determines no longer have the right to remain in the United States.\nUnder the Republican president, those officers are high-profile roles \u2014 making arrests at immigration courts, in the streets and at businesses. They often are criticized by immigration activists and Democratic lawmakers for wearing masks while carrying out their duties.\nOn the recruitment webpage, the link to learn more about applying to be a deportation officer shows a photo of an armored vehicle rolling down a street with officers in military gear hanging onto the sides of the vehicle.\nThe government is also seeking criminal investigators and lawyers who will prosecute immigration cases.\nThe agency said it will advertise at college campuses, job fairs and law enforcement networks, starting this week. But the recruiting drive has raised concerns about what happens if the agency grows too fast.\nStaffing is a long-standing challenge\nICE staffing has long been an issue, said Jason Houser, a former agency chief of staff during the Biden administration.\nAt the beginning of the Trump administration there were roughly 6,000 officers within ICE tasked with monitoring noncitizens in the country, then finding and removing those not eligible to stay.\nThose staffing numbers remained largely static over the years even as the caseload ballooned. During the Biden administration, when the number of people arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border skyrocketed, ICE workers were often pulled from their regular duties to go to the border.\n\u201cICE does need more employees to handle the volume of what they\u2019re handling,\u201d Houser said.\nBut he is concerned about whether the rush to increase staffing could mean lower standards for recruits and training.\nThe Border Patrol\u2019s rapid expansion during the early 2000s serves as a cautionary tale. To meet hiring goals, training and hiring standards were changed. Arrests for employee misconduct rose.\n\u201cIf they start waiving requirements there like they did for Border Patrol, you\u2019re going have an exponential increase in officers that are shown the door after three years because there\u2019s some issue,\u201d he said. At the same time, Houser noted the Department of Homeland Security has dismantled some of the key agencies that have provided some level of oversight over ICE and other DHS arms.\nHouser estimated it would take three to four years to actually hire and train that number of new ICE staffers. In the meantime, he worries that ICE will rely on private contractors, National Guard troops and other federal law enforcement officers to meet the administration\u2019s goal of 3,000 arrests a day.\n$50,000 bonus is on the high end\nChuck Wexler is the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum which studies policing issues. He said police departments across the country have struggled to maintain staffing since the pandemic and the fallout from the death of George Floyd, and are often offering hiring bonuses as a result. He\u2019s seen bonus offers ranging from $10,000 to as much as $60,000 or $70,000 for departments on the West Coast.\nBut he said the $50,000 topline bonus that DHS is offering is definitely on the high end, and Homeland Security\u2019s hiring spree could end up having repercussions on police departments across the country if their officers try to get hired by ICE.\n\u201cThe environment for hiring law enforcement has never been more competitive,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could conceivably impact state and local agencies. You could have someone leaving a police department to get a $50,000 signing bonus with DHS.\u201d"

      "text": "President Donald Trump pushes ahead with his maximalist immigration campaign in face of LA protests\nAnother 2,000 National Guard troops along with 700 Marines are headed to Los Angeles on orders from President Donald Trump, escalating a military presence local officials have said creates logistical challenges for safely handling protests.\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump made no secret of his willingness to exert a maximalist approach to enforcing immigration laws and keeping order as he campaigned to return to the White House. The fulfillment of that pledge is now on full display in Los Angeles.\nThe president has put hundreds of National Guard troops on the streets to quell protests over his administration\u2019s immigration raids, a deployment that state and city officials say has only inflamed tensions. Trump called up the California National Guard over the objections of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2014 the first time in 60 years a president has done so \u2014 and is deploying active-duty troops to support the guard.\nBy overriding Newsom, Trump is already going beyond what he did to respond to Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, when he warned he could send troops to contain demonstrations that turned violent if governors in the states did not act to do so themselves. Trump said in September of that year that he \u201ccan\u2019t call in the National Guard unless we\u2019re requested by a governor\u201d and that \u201cwe have to go by the laws.\u201d\nBut now, the past and current president is moving swiftly, with little internal restraint to test the bounds of his executive authority in order to deliver on his promise of mass deportations. What remains to be seen is whether Americans will stand by him once it\u2019s operationalized nationwide, as Trump looks to secure billions from Congress to dramatically expand the country\u2019s detention and deportation operations.\nFor now, Trump is betting that they will.\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t do the job, that place would be burning down,\u201d Trump told reporters Monday, speaking about California. \u201cI feel we had no choice. ... I don\u2019t want to see what happened so many times in this country.\u201d\n\u2018A crisis of Trump\u2019s own making\u2019\nThe protests began to unfold Friday as federal authorities arrested immigrants in several locations throughout the sprawling city, including in the fashion district of Los Angeles and at a Home Depot. The anger over the administration\u2019s actions quickly spread, with protests in Chicago and Boston as demonstrations in the southern California city also continued Monday.\nBut Trump and other administration officials remained unbowed, capitalizing on the images of burning cars, graffiti and Mexican flags \u2014 which, while not dominant, started to become the defining images of the unrest \u2014 to bolster their law-and-order cause.\nLeaders in the country\u2019s most populous state were similarly defiant.\nCalifornia officials sued the Trump administration Monday, with the state\u2019s attorney general, Rob Bonta, arguing that the deployment of troops \u201ctrampled\u201d on the state\u2019s sovereignty and pushing for a restraining order. The initial deployment of 300 National Guard troops was expected to quickly expand to the full 4,000 that has been authorized by Trump.\nThe state\u2019s senior Democratic senator, Alex Padilla, said in an interview that \u201cthis is absolutely a crisis of Trump\u2019s own making.\u201d\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who are passionate about speaking up for fundamental rights and respecting due process, but the deployment of National Guard only serves to escalate tensions and the situation,\u201d Padilla told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what Donald Trump wanted to do.\u201d\nPadilla slammed the deployment as \u201ccounterproductive\u201d and said the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department was not advised ahead of the federalization of the National Guard. His office has also pushed the Pentagon for a justification on the deployment, and \u201cas far as we\u2019re told, the Department of Defense isn\u2019t sure what the mission is here,\u201d Padilla added.\nCandidate Trump previewed immigration strategy during campaign\nMuch of this was predictable.\nDuring his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump pledged to conduct the largest domestic deportation operation in American history to expel millions of immigrants in the country without legal status. He often praised President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s military-style immigration raids, and the candidate and his advisers suggested they would have broad power to deploy troops domestically to enact Trump\u2019s far-reaching immigration and public safety goals.\nTrump\u2019s speedy deployment in California of troops against those whom the president has alluded to as \u201cinsurrectionists\u201d on social media is a sharp contrast to his decision to issue no order or formal request for National Guard troops during the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, despite his repeated and false assertions that he had made such an offer.\nTrump is now surrounded by officials who have no interest in constraining his power. In 2020, Trump\u2019s then-Pentagon chief publicly rebuked Trump\u2019s threat to send in troops using the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that empowers the president to use the military within the U.S. and against American citizens.\nCurrent Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signaled support on his personal X account for deploying troops to California, writing, \u201cThe National Guard, and Marines if need be, stand with ICE,\u201d referring to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\nThe Defense Department said Monday it is deploying about 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles to support National Guard troops already on the ground to respond to the protests.\nWhite House responds to an \u2018incompetent\u2019 governor\nProtesters over the weekend blocked off a major freeway and burned self-driving cars as police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades in clashes that encompassed several downtown blocks in Los Angeles and led to several dozen arrests. Much of the city saw no violence.\nBut the protests prompted Trump to issue the directive Saturday mobilizing the California National Guard over Newsom\u2019s objections. The president and his top immigration aides accused the governor of mismanaging the protests, with border czar Tom Homan asserting in a Fox News interview Monday that Newsom stoked anti-ICE sentiments and waited two days to declare unlawful assembly in the city.\nTrump told Newsom in a phone call Friday evening to get the situation in Los Angeles under control, a White House official said. It was only when the administration felt Newsom was not restoring order in the city \u2014 and after Trump watched the situation escalate for 24 hours and White House officials saw imagery of federal law enforcement officers with lacerations and other injuries \u2014 that the president moved to deploy the Guard, according to the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an incompetent governor,\u201d Trump said Monday. \u201cLook at the job he\u2019s doing in California. He\u2019s destroying one of our great states.\u201d\nLocal law enforcement officials said Los Angeles police responded as quickly as they could once the protests erupted, and Newsom repeatedly asserted that state and city authorities had the situation under control.\n\u201cLos Angeles is no stranger to demonstrations and protests and rallies and marches,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cLocal law enforcement knows how to handle this and has a rapport with the community and community leaders to be able to allow for that.\u201d\nThe aggressive moves prompted blowback from some of Trump\u2019s erstwhile allies. Ileana Garcia, a Florida state senator who in 2016 founded the group Latinas for Trump and was hired to direct Latino outreach, called the recent escalation \u201cunacceptable and inhumane.\u201d\n\u201cI understand the importance of deporting criminal aliens, but what we are witnessing are arbitrary measures to hunt down people who are complying with their immigration hearings \u2014 in many cases, with credible fear of persecution claims \u2014 all driven by a Miller-like desire to satisfy a self-fabricated deportation goal,\u201d said Garcia, referring to Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff and key architect of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.\nThe tactics could be just a preview to what more could come from the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. GOP lawmakers are working to pass a massive tax-and-border package that includes billions to hire thousands of new officers for Border Patrol and for ICE. The goal, under the Trump-backed plan, is to remove 1 million immigrants without status annually and house 100,000 people in immigration detention centers.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Adriana Gomez Licon in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Tara Copp and Lolita C.

      "text": "Many Americans are witnessing immigration arrests for the first time and reacting\nMany Americans are witnessing immigration arrests for the first time and reacting\nSAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 Adam Greenfield was home nursing a cold when his girlfriend raced in to tell him Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles were pulling up in their trendy San Diego neighborhood.\nThe author and podcast producer grabbed his iPhone and bolted out the door barefoot, joining a handful of neighbors recording masked agents raiding a popular Italian restaurant nearby, as they yelled at the officers to leave. An hour later, the crowd had grown to nearly 75 people, with many in front of the agents\u2019 vehicles.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t stay silent,\u201d Greenfield said. \u201cIt was literally outside of my front door.\u201d\nMore Americans are witnessing people being hauled off as they shop, exercise at the gym, dine out and otherwise go about their daily lives as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration aggressively works to increase immigration arrests. As the raids touch the lives of people who aren\u2019t immigrants themselves, many Americans who rarely, if ever, participated in civil disobedience are rushing out to record the actions on their phones and launch impromptu protests.\nArrests are being made outside gyms, busy restaurants\nGreenfield said on the evening of the May 30 raid, the crowd included grandparents, retired military members, hippies, and restaurant patrons arriving for date night. Authorities threw flash bangs to force the crowd back and then drove off with four detained workers, he said.\n\u201cTo do this, at 5 o\u2019clock, right at the dinner rush, right on a busy intersection with multiple restaurants, they were trying to make a statement,\u201d Greenfield said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if their intended point is getting across the way they want it to. I think it is sparking more backlash.\u201d\nPreviously, many arrests happened late at night or in the pre-dawn hours by agents waiting outside people\u2019s homes as they left for work or outside their work sites when they finished their day. When ICE raided another popular restaurant in San Diego in 2008, agents did it in the early morning without incident.\nWhite House border czar Tom Homan has said agents are being forced to make more arrests in communities because of sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with ICE in certain cities and states. ICE enforces immigration laws nationwide but seeks state and local help in alerting federal authorities of immigrants wanted for deportation and holding that person until federal officers take custody.\nVice President JD Vance, during a visit to Los Angeles on Friday, said those policies have given agents \u201ca bit of a morale problem because they\u2019ve had the local government in this community tell them that they\u2019re not allowed to do their job.\u201d\n\u201cWhen that Border Patrol agent goes out to do their job, they said within 15 minutes they have protesters, sometimes violent protesters who are in their face obstructing them,\u201d he said.\n\u2018It was like a scene out of a movie\u2019\nMelyssa Rivas had just arrived at her office in the Los Angeles suburb of Downey, California one morning last week when she heard the frightened screams of young women. She went outside to find the women confronting nearly a dozen masked federal agents who had surrounded a man kneeling on the pavement.\n\u201cIt was like a scene out of a movie,\u201d Rivas said. \u201cThey all had their faces covered and were standing over this man who was clearly traumatized. And there are these young girls screaming at the top of their lungs.\u201d\nAs Rivas began recording the interaction, a growing group of neighbors shouted at the agents to leave the man alone. They eventually drove off in vehicles, without detaining him, video shows.\nRivas spoke to the man afterward, who told her the agents had arrived at the car wash where he worked that morning, then pursued him as he fled on his bicycle. It was one of several recent workplace raids in the majority-Latino city.\nThe same day, federal agents were seen at a Home Depot, a construction site and an LA Fitness gym. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many people had been detained.\n\u201cEveryone is just rattled,\u201d said Alex Frayde, an employee at LA Fitness who said he saw the agents outside the gym and stood at the entrance, ready to turn them away as another employee warned customers about the sighting. In the end, the agents never came in.\nCommunities protest around ICE buildings\nArrests at immigration courts and other ICE buildings have also prompted emotional scenes as masked agents have turned up to detain people going to routine appointments and hearings.\nIn the city of Spokane in eastern Washington state, hundreds of people rushed to protest outside an ICE building June 11 after former city councilor Ben Stuckart posted on Facebook. Stuckart wrote that he was a legal guardian of a Venezuelan asylum seeker who went to check in at the ICE building, only to be detained. His Venezuelan roommate was also detained.\nBoth men had permission to live and work in the U.S. temporarily under humanitarian parole, Stuckart told The Associated Press.\n\u201cI am going to sit in front of the bus,\u201d Stuckart wrote, referring to the van that was set to transport the two men to an ICE detention center in Tacoma. \u201cThe Latino community needs the rest of our community now. Not tonight, not Saturday, but right now!!!!\u201d\nThe city of roughly 230,000 is the seat of Spokane County, where just over half of voters cast ballots for Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\nStuckart was touched to see his mother\u2019s caregiver among the demonstrators.\n\u201cShe was just like, \u2018I\u2019m here because I love your mom, and I love you, and if you or your friends need help, then I want to help,\u2019\u201d he said through tears.\nBy evening, the Spokane Police Department sent over 180 officers, with some using pepper balls, to disperse protesters. Over 30 people were arrested, including Stuckart who blocked the transport van with others. He was later released.\nAysha Mercer, a stay-at-home mother of three, said she is \u201cnot political in any way, shape or form.\u201d But many children in her Spokane neighborhood \u2014 who play in her yard and jump on her trampoline \u2014 come from immigrant families, and the thought of them being affected by deportations was \u201cunacceptable,\u201d she said.\nShe said she wasn\u2019t able to go to Stuckart\u2019s protest. But she marched for the first time in her life on June 14, joining millions in \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests across the country.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt as strongly as I do right this here second,\u201d she said.\n_____\nOffenhartz reported from Los Angeles and Rush from Portland, Oregon."

Meanwhile, he has invoked federal powers to take control of Washington D.C.'s police department and deploy National Guard troops amid rising crime, despite local officials arguing that crime rates are decreasing. Trump's recent tax and spending bill, which includes significant funding for immigration enforcement and mass deportations, has raised concerns among lawmakers about its impact on low-income Americans and the overall economy.",
