      "summary": "Baker Hughes shares fell amid concerns over lower oil prices, yet Carillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund still highlighted BKR as a strong pick due to healthy order trends in its Industrial & Energy Technology segment and growing demand for power‑generation solutions. The company reported a 7% YoY rise in adjusted EBITDA to $1.21 billion, driven by cost actions and robust orders, including $550 million in data‑center power equipment. Despite the downturn, BKR’s diversified portfolio and focus on LNG, data‑center power, and new‑energy projects position it for upside, though hedge funds have reduced holdings. The fund’s letter underscores BKR’s resilience amid market volatility and its potential to benefit from the AI‑driven energy demand surge.",
