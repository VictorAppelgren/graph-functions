      "summary": "Validea’s report rates AutoZone Inc. (AZO) highly, giving it a 93% score under Pim van Vliet’s low‑volatility, momentum‑and‑high‑payout‑yield multi‑factor model, indicating strong interest for investors seeking low risk and solid returns. The report explains Van Vliet’s strategy of filtering the largest stocks for low volatility, high net payout yield, and intermediate‑term momentum, and notes that Validea’s model returns are back‑tested and not guaranteed. It also includes extensive performance and disclaimer information, as well as a broader overview of Validea’s other guru‑based strategies and factor‑based portfolios.",
