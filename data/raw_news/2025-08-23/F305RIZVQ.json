  "description": "In a recent interview, Mark Cuban was asked about one sector and he called it the worst industry.",
  "content": "Entrepreneur Mark Cuban may owe a portion of his success to the media sector thanks to his founding of Broadcast.com and early days of advancing the streaming market.\n\nThese days, the media sector is one Cuban avoids when investing in companies.\n\nCuban is mostly staying away from investments in the media sector, he said in a recent interview with Semafor.\n\n\"It's the worst industry in the history of industries,\" Cuban said.\n\nCuban said artificial intelligence has made it easier for creators to launch media companies without relying on third-party companies.\n\nCuban said there is no limit if you're creative, as creators are less limited on time, funding, or access to professionals now than they were before.\n\nThe entrepreneur said media is faster, better and cheaper today.\n\nYou may not be a billionaire like Mark Cuban, but you can uncover hidden gems in the stock market using our proprietary data and pattern recognition \u2014 check out five stocks flying under the radar that deserve your attention.\n\nDuring the interview, Cuban recalled his early days in the media sector with the creation of Audionet, which would later become Broadcast.com.\n\nCuban remembered recording radio station feeds in Texas. During the interview, Cuban showed off the first two VCR tapes he used to record hours of radio content, which he now has framed.\n\nStreaming back in 1995 was extremely complicated, Cuban recalled, saying that you had to have a computer, a specific modem, subscription to internet service providers and download streaming client software.\n\nOver time, Cuban turned the efforts into a success with streaming radio stations, police scanners and Chicago Cubs games. This was also happening before there were digital copyright laws, Cuban added.\n\nStreaming a Victoria's Secret fashion show and sharing transcripts of the Monica Lewinsky, Bill Clinton tapes were big moments that led to huge traffic spikes for Cuban's company, he said.\n\nCuban later sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo for $5.7 billion.\n\nWhat Took So Long?\n\nCuban was confident in streaming years before others even knew what streaming was.\n\n\"Everyone would call me a f***ing moron,\" Cuban said.\n\nThe entrepreneur recalled saying streaming would replace television as things got cheaper and faster. Cuban said getting into cars and on phones was the moment he knew streaming had hit full scale.\n\nCuban is shocked at how long it took though.\n\n\"I thought by 2005, 2010 it would all be ubiquitous like it is now.\"\n\nCuban said people using Netflix don't even know that they're streaming today.\n\u2022 Mark Cuban Said Sports Fans And Grandmas Knew Him Before \u2018Shark Tank\u2019: How The Business Show Changed His Celebrity Status",

      "text": "- Mark Cuban may have been early to the world of audio and video streaming.\n- A desire to listen to and watch Indiana University basketball games led to the creation of a company.\n- See the 6X seasonal strategy set to target this fall\u2019s biggest opportunities. Details here \u2192\nMark Cuban's journey from software entrepreneur to billionaire began with a tech company called MicroSolutions in the 1980s.\nWhile many remember Cuban for his later ventures, it was MicroSolutions that first established him in the business world.\n\"What we were really good at was connecting them into networks and writing software for them. Sold that. Made a lot of money there,\" Cuban recently shared on the \"Life in Seven Songs\" podcast, reflecting on his early success in the tech industry.\nThis experience laid the foundation for his next big leap: the creation of AudioNet, later known as Broadcast.com.\nIn 1994, a conversation with an old friend sparked a game-changing idea.\n\"One of my good buddies from Indiana, Todd Wagner, and I were having lunch at California Pizza Kitchen, and he was like, you know, there\u2019s this new thing called the Internet,\" Cuban recalls.\nInspired by the potential of streaming, they set out to bring audio content online.\n\"And we started a company called Audio Net, a website. It was called AudioNet.com, went to local radio stations, literally connected an eight-hour VCR,\" he shares.\nCuban recalled streaming Indiana University basketball games and later posting on message boards asking if others were interested in any other streams they could offer.\nDid You Know?\n- Congress Is Making Huge Investments. Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use Tool\nCuban's knack for innovation and willingness to experiment with new technology allowed him to push the boundaries of what the internet could do in its early days.\n\"We were the YouTube of our day,\" Cuban added. \"We dominated. We did audio, we did video. I mean, you name it, we did it.\"\nThe billionaire entrepreneur also recalled streaming a Victoria's Secret Runway show that \"kind of like broke the Internet,\" according to podcast host Sophie Bearman.\n\"It didn't work out as well as we wanted to. But you live and you learn,\" Cuban added.\nTheir gamble paid off. In 1999, Yahoo! acquired Broadcast.com for $5.7 billion in stock. Reflecting on the deal, Cuban said, \"And then we sold to Yahoo, who kinda screwed it up. But they paid me a lot of money for the right to screw it up.\"\nWhile Yahoo! struggled to integrate Broadcast.com, the sale made Cuban one of the wealthiest tech entrepreneurs of the dot-com era. His journey from MicroSolutions to Broadcast.com not only solidified his status as a visionary but also set the stage for his future ventures.\nRead Next:\nPhoto: Courtesy of Gage Skidmore on flickr\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Learn how to time your next move. Details here \u2192\nEach week, Benzinga's Stock Whisper Index uses a combination of proprietary data and pattern recognition to showcase five stocks that are just under the surface and deserve attention.\nInvestors are constantly on the hunt for undervalued, under-followed and emerging stocks. With countless methods available to retail traders, the challenge often lies in sifting through the abundance of information to uncover new opportunities and understand why certain stocks should be of interest.\nHere\u2019s a look at the Benzinga Stock Whisper Index for the week ending August 15:\nEmbraer SA ERJ: The jet manufacturing company saw strong interest from readers during the week. The company reported second-quarter financial results with earnings per share missing analyst estimates and revenue beating estimates. The quarter saw record revenue and a large backlog worth $29.7 billion. The backlog and the company's pledge to make a $1 billion investment in the U.S. are boosting investor confidence as the company has some tariff concerns given its ties to Brazil. Analysts raised the price targets on the stock and shares remain up over 50% year-to-date.\nThredUp Inc TDUP: The online resale apparel company continues to see shares soar in 2025, hitting the highest levels since 2022. The company beat earnings per share estimates and beat revenue estimates from analysts in the second quarter. This marked a fourth straight quarter of a double beat on the key financial metrics. The company also raised its full-year revenue outlook from a range of $281 million to $291 million to a new range of $298 million to $302 million. The company's third quarter revenue guidance also came in ahead of analyst estimates. Analysts raised their price targets on the stock after the quarterly financial results, which were reported earlier this month.\nXometry Inc XMTR: The AI-enabled manufacturing equipment company saw strong interest from readers during the week with shares up around 1%. The company reported second quarter financial results earlier this month. The second quarter results beat analyst estimates for earnings per share and revenue, a sixth straight quarter with a double beat. Xometry raised its full year outlook and sees margins expanding going forward. Analysts raised their price targets on the stock after quarterly results.\nCardlytics Inc CDLX: The advertising platforms company is one of the smaller names to appear on the Stock Whisper Index and comes with the warning of higher volatility as a penny stock and low market capitalization name. The company reported mixed second quarter results with earnings per share beating analyst estimates and revenue missing estimates slightly. The company's third quarter revenue guidance is below analyst estimates. Despite the mixed results and weak guidance, shares held up fairly strong during the week down around 1% and the stock is seeing increased interest signaling a potential stock to watch.\nForward Industries FORD: The protective solutions company reported third quarter financial results that showed declining revenue and earnings per share. The company's revenue was down 3.9% year-over-year and missed estimates. Adjusted EBITDA improved in the quarter despite the declining revenue. Company executives highlighted improved pricing and cost controls that could boost margins going forward. While shares were down 5% during the week, the stock remains up over 170% year-to-date and could be a stock to watch going forward.\nStay tuned for next week's report, and follow Benzinga Pro for all the latest headlines and top market-moving stories here.\nRead the latest Stock Whisper Index reports here:\nRead Next:\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Learn how to time your next move. Details here \u2192\nMark Cuban, the entrepreneur and Dallas Mavericks stakeholder, says his role on \u201cShark Tank\u201d not only boosted his visibility but also underscored why some CEOs need to be more active in the media, sharing their company's story and investments.\nCuban on \u2018Shark Tank'\nCuban joined \"Shark Tank\" as a guest shark in the show's second season. He later became a regular in the third season.\nJeff Foxworthy and Cuban each did three guest episodes. In an interview with Semafor, Cuban recalls everything falling into place for him on the show.\n\"They invited me back,\" Cuban said.\nCuban recalled the show bouncing around at the start, being shown on television if another show was cancelled or didn't have new episodes. Eventually, it caught on and \"just took off.\"\n\u201cShark Tank\u201d also introduced Cuban's business style to new audiences, expanding his visibility beyond Mavericks fans\u2014and even \"grandmas\" who remembered him from \u201cDancing with the Stars.\u201d While the show elevated his celebrity \"to a whole new level,\" Cuban said it didn't change how he does business.\nRead Also: Mark Cuban Reveals 4 Rules To Becoming A Millionaire: \u2018Find Something You Can Be Good At.

      "text": "- Mark Cuban invested in companies that he understood or that could help his NBA team during his time on \"Shark Tank.\"\n- Cuban found himself breaking his investing rules on occasion including an episode where he invested in a product category he didn't know.\n- See the seasonal trading strategy that's beating the S&P 500 by 6X this year. Details here \u2192\nMark Cuban made numerous deals during his time on hit show \"Shark Tank,\" including many in categories he knew well like sports, entertainment and men's products.\nCuban may have broken one of his investment rules during the Season 14, episode 15 of \"Shark Tank.\"\nWhat Happened: Mark Cuban likes to invest in companies that have products he could see himself using or that could be used by the Dallas Mavericks, the National Basketball Association team he owns.\nOn a past episode of \"Shark Tank,\" Cuban offered a deal for a company whose products he'll likely never use.\nThe Season 14, episode 15 of \"Shark Tank\" aired in early March and featured a pitch by makeup company Youthforia.\nThe company launched in April 2021 and had $2 million in sales prior to appearing on the episode, according to CNBC. The company had seen some levels of viral success thanks to TikTok and mentions of its color-changing oil blush that reacts and blends into customers' skin. On TikTok, Youthforia has over 130,000 followers and over three million likes.\nThe Sharks liked the TikTok success and were also impressed with the company's founder and CEO Fiona Co Chan.\nKevin O'Leary offered Co Chan $100,000 for 20% of the company along with a $300,000 loan and a cut of distribution pay.\n\"It's a bet on the jockey on this deal,\" O'Leary said of Co Chan. \"You're really impressive.\"\nCo Chan wanted to hear from the other Sharks, with Cuban and Barbara Corcoran not putting out bids yet. Co Chan tried to lure them in by saying there was a launch of more shades of blush coming, which neither was thrilled about.\n\"When you have something that's completely differentiated, you ride that, and you don't do anything else, because that just dilutes your efforts,\" Cuban said. \"Sometimes, you shouldn't listen to your customers.\"\nCo Chan turned to O'Leary and offered 5% equity for $400,000 and a 50 cent royalty for each unit sold by the company up to $500,000.\nO'Leary countered with an $800,000 offer for 10% equity and a $1 royalty on each unit.\nThis is when Cuban decided to step in, offering $400,000 for 10% without a royalty and said the reason he was interested in the makeup brand was because his daughters and wife would \"understand\" the product, which he didn't.\nCuban offered to wear the color-changing blush himself as part of demos.\nO'Leary countered with a $400,000 offer for 7.5% and a 75 cent royalty on sales up to $1 million.\nUltimately, Cuban got Co Chan to accept with his final offer of $400,000 for 8% and no royalties, which he offered \"just to prove a point\" and ended up beating O'Leary.\nYou may not be a billionaire like Mark Cuban, but you can uncover hidden gems in the stock market using our proprietary data and pattern recognition \u2014 check out five stocks flying under the radar that deserve your attention.\nWhy It's Important: The company and Co Chan drew praise from the Sharks during portions of the pitch and after Cuban's offer was accepted.\nHerjavec and Corcoran, who sat out on the offers, said they were impressed with Co Chan's negotiating skills.\n\"Kevin, you have to get up and leave the \u2018Shark Tank,'\" Herjavec said. \"Fiona's taking your chair.\"\nThe offer for Youthforia that was accepted makes the first deal Cuban has ever done with a makeup brand, which could provide several lessons. Cuban has often stuck to his principles in investing in products that he would use himself or the Mavericks would use.\nHearing how much the other Sharks loved the company\u2019s CEO and the product going viral on TikTok, Cuban trusted in his family and made the investment because he could see his daughters and wife using the product.\nYouthforia is available on Amazon.com and also at Ulta Beauty ULTA stores. While we won't likely see the makeup products at Mavericks games in the future, they could end up becoming a staple in the Cuban household.\nCuban stepped away from \"Shark Tank\" after Season 16, which aired in May 2025.\n\"It's not being on TV that's made it special. It's sending a message to everybody that watches that the American dream is alive and well,\" Cuban said on the \"Life in Seven Songs\" podcast of \"Shark Tank.\"\nRead Next:\nThis story is part of a series of features on the subject of success, Benzinga Inspire.\nThis article was previously published by Benzinga and has been updated.\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
