      "feedback": "This draft needs a tighter, 4–6 sentence executive brief with a clear causal chain and decision‑useful thresholds; restructure into: a crisp house view (policy regime → risk assets → ACMR earnings/multiples); explicit near‑term catalysts; a medium‑term base case with bull/bear branches and invalidation points; and a focused watch‑list, all anchored to source IDs. Strengthen first‑principles grounding by tying regime shifts to quantified deltas (e.g., ~150bp of total rate cuts starting in September) and to a price path for ACMR (mid‑to‑high $30s toward the $34.76 target if discount rates fall), with every numeric claim tied to a cited ID (e.g., C22MKA9VY for rate/path, SK994CBWR for ACMR earnings/price targets, 0G3A676BP for cloud metrics). For the 0–3 week horizon, spell out explicit triggers and invalidation rules: e.g., Jackson Hole/BoJ signals that lift funding costs would cap upside; JOBY/OPEN moves or fresh earnings guidance that contradict the policy path should trigger reassessment, with citations (e.g., K0WFSW29E, TXVQ5ZQ0N, H9WSBYP3D; 37UZC9X8I). Expand the medium horizon with a formal bull and bear path, including a 3–6 month target range (roughly $34–$36 on ACMR in a constructive, policy‑driven world; $30–$32 in a tougher regime; $36–$38 if IPO momentum and small‑cap tech rerate beyond base), and explicit invalidation triggers (policy pivot to tightening, export‑control tightening, or a material slowdown in export‑controls relief) with sources (Q7VVGNSQE, C22MKA9VY, SK994CBWR, H7Q52FKDH). Reconcile cross‑asset and cross‑border tensions by explicitly stating a base case that integrates GX057ADL7 and 37UZC9X8I versus the Chips Act/EM dynamics (H7Q52FKDH), and ensure coverage of all critical sources in every factual claim. Finally, prune filler, standardize ACMR naming, and add a compact, numerical sensitivity framework: a one‑sentence price‑path trigger per horizon, plus a short watchlist with decisive IDs (e.g., MSFT cloud spend 21.2% CAGR from 0G3A676BP; Shopify MSFT proxies; and the IPO/ETC signals tied to Q7VVGNSQE and TN66GHPAT).",
