      "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security and Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C. are collaborating on traffic checks and immigration enforcement, following a directive from Chief Pamela A. Smith that allows police to share information about individuals detained during traffic stops with federal immigration authorities. This change comes amid the Trump administration's efforts to assert control over local law enforcement and diminish D.C.'s status as a sanctuary city. Concurrently, President Trump is preparing for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, where discussions will likely include trade and arms control alongside the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.",
