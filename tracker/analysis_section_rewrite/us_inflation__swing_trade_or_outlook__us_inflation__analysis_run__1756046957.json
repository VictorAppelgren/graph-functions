      "feedback": "Your draft is rich in macro scaffolding but fails the SECTION FOCUS constraints and coherence tests. Actionable edits: (1) Strip to exactly 4 Movers lines (2 Up, 2 Down) formatted as: Direction | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %. Pick Up1 (1–3 months) and Up2 (3–6 months) that hinge on Ford’s EV pivot timing and tariff relief, and Down1 (0–3 months) and Down2 (1–3 months) that hinge on tariff escalation and higher-for-longer rates. Ensure each line cites only the specific facts/numbers used (IDs from SOURCE MATERIAL) and contains no extraneous prose. (2) Convert the causal chain into a tight first-principles narrative: policy regime (tariff pass-through) drives inflation expectations, which lift discount rates and compress multiples, while Ford’s EV profitability pivot and F-Series cash flow anchor income/yield; keep the chain linear and avoid detours into unrelated macro debates. (3) For catalysts and invalidation, name explicit triggers (Model E timing/pivot; tariff pass-through magnitude; EV capex pacing) and explicit invalidations (tariff escalation beyond the assumed cap; delayed EV profitability). Provide crisp, testable catalysts with concrete time windows. (4) Quantification: assign probabilities anchored to material evidence (e.g., base‑case moderate confidence ~60%, downside ~20–25%, upside ~15–20%), and replace vague or stray numbers (the 28%, 60%, 65, etc.) with a consistent set like 30%, 25%, 25%, 20% across the four lines, each tied to the cited sources (W2622L6WW; 22PL3Q360; GX057ADL7; IGP1Q4ZEJ as appropriate). (5) Outlook/Swing Trade: since Ford is tradable, add a single Swing Trade line after the four movers, with Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence %, using Ford-specific data (yield ~5%, forward P/E ~10x) and a plausible price‑level framework; supply concrete numbers or clearly label them as current-price bands to be filled from quotes. (6) Tighten citation discipline: attach IDs only to claims/facts that require them, remove non-assertive long paragraphs, and ensure coverage of core sources (W2622L6WW; 22PL3Q360; GX057ADL7; EPJYXB7DX; UPV3X2MQ6; ILYC1M41F; IGP1Q4ZEJ; YVQU6QCY4) while reconciling conflicts (e.g., tariff paths vs EV headwinds) in a brief, explicit note. Overall, replace the sprawling narrative with a compact, 5–6 line deliverable: 4 movers (2 Up, 2 Down) plus 1 Swing Trade line, each line razor-focused on an actionable catalyst, a precise watchlist/trigger, and a defensible probability sourced from the material.",
