  "content": "5 Obscure Yamaha Motorcycles You May Not Have Heard Of\n\nOf the many motorcycle manufacturers around the planet, Yamaha undoubtedly stands out among the crowd. Since it first introduced a capable off-road machine, the Yamaha DT-1 of 1967, Yamaha has excelled in delivering highly praised models for motocross and more. Not to be pigeon-holed only as a dirt bike maker, Yamaha has likewise produced a seemingly unlimited number of excellent street machines, including legends like the V-Max, XS650, Virago, and, more recently, the technologically advanced and blisteringly quick Yamaha R9. Yet, for every one of these bold and endearing motorcycles you can name, there are probably three you cannot, and sometimes those are the models with the most interesting stories to tell. Yamaha has built a lot of two-wheelers over the years. Most of them have been motorcycles, but scooters have long been a part of the mix. For all intents and purposes, if it has two wheels and runs on gasoline, it may as well be a motorcycle. Furthermore, product offerings in the various global regions differ, leading to regional models that receive little recognition elsewhere. Other globally-produced models just never sold well. Regardless of how they came to be, here are five Yamaha models you may not have heard of due to their high level of obscurity.\n\nIt would be absurd to call a Yamaha AG200 obscure when speaking with someone who has spent time in Africa. After all, the AG200 is produced specifically for that continent, and it is rarely seen elsewhere. The African continent presents unique transportation difficulties, and reaching many parts of it is impossible without the proper machine. Furthermore, even with the right off-road vehicle, the lack of available parts can leave you stuck many kilometers from help. This is why Yamaha's AG200 is built with a rugged frame and equipped with a durable but simple engine. Its air-cooled 196cc single cylinder produces only about 16 horsepower, but it runs for hours without missing a stroke. When it breaks, it is simple to fix with basic tools and minimal parts. Drum brakes and an enclosed chain keep rocks and debris from damaging critical parts, while racks on the front and back provide needed cargo capacity. The AG200's simplicity and durability make it perfect for getting medicines to remote communities. Riders for Health has been using them for many years to do just that and help save the lives of Africans in multiple countries. And while the AG200 remains obscure to many of us, it shall continue to do meaningful work across Africa into the future.\n\nWhen Yamaha decided to enter the scooter market in the late '70s, it chose to introduce a model specifically marketed toward women in the 1977 Yamaha Passol. That may not have been a big seller everywhere, but it appears to have been a good enough idea for Yamaha to introduce the Popgal a few years later. Like the Passol, Yamaha marketed the Popgal toward women, with a strategy primarily focused on housewives. It presents as a fashionable little machine with an entirely unique aesthetic. It is rather interesting in that its styling somewhat resembles that of a classic American chopper. It has swept-back handlebars with a little gas tank high up on a sloping crossbar, while the thickly cushioned seat and slick chrome exhaust finalized the look. The wire wheels are also a nice touch. Unlike a chopper, the Popgal's two-stroke 49cc engine is only good for a few horsepower and would struggle mightily on the open American highway. The two-speed automatic transmission and shaft drive probably appealed to many women buyers, but detailed information is hard to come by. It probably sold only in a few markets aside from its home turf in Japan, but a recent listing for a 1985 model suggests it lasted at least a few years and made it to the United Kingdom.\n\nMany products are instantly recognizable as being from the 1980s just because of their unique styling. While many motorcycles, including Yamaha models, were built with more timeless designs that may still look fresh today, the Riva 180 scooter is definitely not one of those. While many who know about the popular Honda Elite and Helix scooters of this period might think they were the first to bring this boxy and fully enclosed frame aesthetic, the Yamaha predated them both by a couple of years. Introduced in 1983 as a 180cc model, Yamaha took a break in 1986 and reintroduced it with an additional 20cc of displacement. The engines are air-cooled singles capable of accelerating up to about 70 mph. While not the fastest bikes around, they are extraordinarily comfortable. If you manage to find one that's well-kept \u2014 and has its notorious auto-choke repaired \u2014 Yamaha reliability is built into every model. A Riva is going to be hard to find. According to info about a recall for '87-'88 models, we can deduce that Yamaha only sold about 1,750 that year in the United States. You can be sure most of those have long ago been wrecked, rusted out, or scrapped. But once in a while, you might be able to pick one up from Bring a Trailer for a couple of grand, and you will be guaranteed to turn heads at every stoplight if you do.\n\nMany are familiar with the Honda Helix, which was sold from 1986 until 2007, representing a long and successful run for a low-slung, laid-back, and extra-long scooter. Furthermore, anyone who has ridden one can attest to the extreme level of comfort it provides. It kind of feels like riding a living room recliner, but in a good way. Perhaps not content to let Honda have all the fun, Yamaha offered a similar model with updated styling between 2005 and 2008. While obviously not designed in the 1980s, the styling of the Morphous can be a bit divisive as one of those love-it-or-hate-it kinds of looks. It is long and low, making it extra comfortable, and its modern liquid-cooled and fuel-injected 250cc engine should provide plenty of power for general commuting and around-town driving. As a bonus, the Morphous has three cargo areas including a glove box, trunk, and under seat storage. But still, some might say it has a face only a mother can love. Total sales figures may not be available, but it should be safe to say they were very low. If this is the look you are into, you'll likely have to travel far to buy one today, unless you're very lucky.\n\nIt seems Yamaha is fond of making tiny versions of its motorcycles. For example, the Yamaha YSR 50 is a pint-size version of a superbike that is a blast to ride and punches well above its weight. Furthermore, small bikes like the Honda Grom and Monkey have done well lately. But back around 1980, it seems that Yamaha wanted to take minibike brinksmanship to a new level ... of small. The 1980 Yamaha Pocke might be the tiniest street-legal motorcycle ever produced by a major motorcycle manufacturer. Unsurprisingly, it is powered by a 49cc engine with a four-speed transmission and stopped by drum brakes only. Perhaps more surprising is that it rides on wheels with only a 6-inch diameter. The wheel span barely clears the length of an ordinary baguette, and if you are not careful, you might slide off the back just stretching your legs a bit. And while it appears to be a toy, it has all the equipment necessary to be road legal, and you can find examples for sale already tagged and inspected. Although you might feel conspicuously unsafe riding in city traffic, the Pocke does look like it would be a blast in the right setting. And given its diminutive stature, the 49cc engine likely provides ample power to provide a feeling of cheating death with every ride. With that knowledge, the logical next step is to start looking for one to buy immediately.",

      "text": "The New Yamaha R9 Is Here: Key Features, Specs, And Pricing Details\nFor a while now, all we've been able to do when it comes to the Yamaha R9 is speculate. Yamaha killed off the R6, one of its most legendary sports bikes, a few years back and the R1 is likely on the chopping block soon, so we've all been guessing as to what will fill the epic sport bike-sized hole in Yamaha's lineup. Now the time has come to finally pull the sheet off the R9 and see what the facts are \u2014 and it turns out, we weren't very far off with most of our predictions.\nThe R9 is an all-new motorcycle for Yamaha, using some pre-existing components from current motorcycles in the lineup, but occupying a whole new space amongst its sport bikes. The model uses a known engine, some known suspension components, and familiar styling from its already-popular sport bike family. Essentially, the R9 is an excellent addition to the current lineup of R-Series motorcycles from Yamaha, sliding in next to bikes like the R1M, R1, R7, and R3. The model is priced between the R7 and the R1, with performance that fits nicely in that space, too, and it offers a number of modern features that should make it seriously popular at your next local bike night or at any upcoming track event.\nPower brought to you by Yamaha's 890 cc three-cylinder CP3 engine\nThe R9 gets its power from Yamaha's CP3, a three-cylinder engine with 890 ccs of displacement. The CP3 engine is used in multiple Yamaha motorcycles (more on that shortly), and in the R9 its power output is a healthy 117 horsepower and 68.6 lb-ft of torque. Yamaha claims wet weight (full of fluids and fuel) as 430 pounds, providing a respectable power-to-weight ratio. Yamaha has also stated that the R9 gets a unique ECU tune and gear ratios that optimize track performance and a manageable riding nature on the street.\nLike the MT-09 and the XSR900 (which both use Yamaha's CP3 engine), the R9 is paired with a six-speed manual transmission. It also uses a quick shifter that enables clutchless upshifts and downshifts. Fuel is stored in an adequately-sized 3.7-gallon tank (just like the MT-09 and XSR900) that should get you pretty far, considering Yamaha's claimed fuel economy of 48 mpg.\nThe R9 also uses the same 11.5:1 compression ratio as its aforementioned Yamaha stablemates and while we wouldn't go as far as calling it an XSR900 or an MT-09 with fairings, it's pretty close. Quickly cast aside any thoughts of that being an aspersion, though \u2014 the CP3 has excellent power delivery, especially in the low-RPM range, and it makes several of Yamaha's bikes very engaging to ride. We expect much of the same from the R9.\nMore specs and how the R9 fits in Yamaha's lineup\nThe R9 has a number of features that street and track riders will likely appreciate. The 43 mm KYB front shocks (the same size as those currently equipped to the R1) offer adjustments for preload, compression, and damping. The R9's Brembo brakes are a bit larger up front than those on bikes like the MT-09 and XSR, measuring 320 mm on the front rotor of the R9 (the same size as the Brembo brakes on the R1). The MT-09 and XSR front rotors check in at a slightly-smaller 298 mm. The R9's rear brakes match those of the R1 at 220 mm.\nWhile it may share its CP3 engine and many of its parts with other Yamaha bikes, the R9 does have a very unique frame. According to Yamaha, the new gravity-cast frame is the lightest aluminum frame ever produced for one of its supersport bikes. The R9 also comes with MotoGP-inspired winglets on the front fairings, a feature normally reserved for class-leading liter bikes like the R1 that clearly displays the R9's track-ready intentions.\nPricing and features for the new R9\nWhen it hits dealership floors, the R9 will have an MSRP of $13,124 (including $625 destination fee) which is a bit higher than the MT-09 ($11,174 including destination) and the two-cylinder R7 at $9,799 (including $600 destination fee). What's worth noting, though, is just how much cheaper than the outgoing R1 the new R9 is. The standard 2025 Yamaha R1 starts at $19,624 (including destination), which is $6,500 more than the new R9. Sure, the R9 is less aggressive and a bit less likely to tear up the track than the epic R1 that took sports bikes to the next level, but you can buy a lot of tires, track time, and riding experience for $6,500.\nFor its $13k-ish starting price, the R9 is pretty modern, offering features like a five-inch color TFT with smartphone connectivity and configurable rider displays. Cruise control is available at speeds over 25 miles per hour, self-canceling turn signals are included as standard. Launch control comes standard, as well as preset and customizable ride modes which allow you to adjust power, traction control, slide control, and lift control. Even engine braking can be adjusted to fit rider preferences.\nAvailable colors at launch will include Team Yamaha blue, Matte Raven black, and Intensity White/Redline. More colors will likely debut in future model years, but it's a pretty good base from Yamaha for now. It may not replace the R6 or the R1 in our hearts, but the new 2025 Yamaha R9 has certainly piqued our interest."

      "text": "Honda Grom Vs. Monkey: How Do These Mini Motorcycles Compare?\nWhile Honda is arguably better known today for manufacturing some of the most durable and fuel-efficient four-wheeled vehicles on the road, it's worth noting that the Japanese company actually got its start building vehicles with two wheels. Indeed, the company started in 1948 as a manufacturer of bicycle auxiliary engines and released its first in-house motorcycle a year later.\nOver the decades, Honda has gone on to manufacture a broad lineup of bikes fit for tackling roadways, race tracks, and off-road terrain. They've even developed a line of miniature motorcycles built for casually cruising about town or jetting from one end of the beach to the next. These days, Honda's miniMOTO lineup includes a couple of slick little builds called the Grom and the Monkey, each of which will help you get around town in high style, and currently rank among the best street-legal minis around.\nOf course, if you've even casually glanced at either of those Honda miniatures online or in person at a dealership, you know the Grom and the Monkey boast decidedly different styles on the design front, with the former having a decidedly modern look and the latter going for a more retro-inspired concept. However, the differences in the miniMOTO machines stretch beyond the cosmetic. Here's a closer look at how Honda's Grom and Monkey miniature motorcycles compare.\nHonda Grom\nWe'll begin with the Honda Grom, as it is the cheaper of the miniature motorcycles at the base-level build, which will run you a very reasonable $3,599. That price alone has made the sports-bike inspired Grom rank among the most affordable bikes on the market in 2024. Combined with its obvious cool factor, the wallet-friendly price has helped make the bike a popular and long-standing addition to Honda's motorcycle lineup, with the Grom having made its debut in 2014.\nWhile the bike is deemed street legal in all 50 U.S. states, it seems Groms are not certified for highway use in certain states like California, which require vehicles to have at least a 150cc engine for use there. Given that the Grom's 124cc engines tend to top out at 55 mph, it might be a good idea to avoid using them on the freeway even in states where they are permitted. In any case, you'll need to verify the Grom's freeway legality in your state before you hit the on-ramp.\nApart from the pint-sized Grom's surprisingly solid displacement, the miniMOTO's power output is bolstered by Programmed Fuel Injection, a feature that also helps with fuel efficiency, with Honda claiming this 224-pound build is capable of hitting 166.5 miles per gallon. The Grom's low-to-the-ground 30-inch seat height likely makes it easier to control for experienced riders and neophytes alike, and the bike's single-shock setup should deliver a smooth enough ride for either faction. Meanwhile, the Grom's multifunction digital display rounds out its modern stylings.\nHonda Monkey\nStyle is the biggest difference between these Honda builds, and if style is what you're most interested in when it comes to miniature motorcycles, you might be hard-pressed to find one quite as cool as the retro-inspired Monkey. As it is, the bike's retro looks are not just Honda's stab at boosting its curb appeal. In fact, the Monkey's retro look is far more authentic, as the build made its debut in the early 1960s as an amusement park feature fit for adult and child riders alike.\nMonkeys have seen all manner of upgrades and redesigns since riding out of the amusement park scene, though the current models arguably look more like those from the 1970s than any other era. Whatever the case, the bike's old-school style is likely a big part of why it costs a little more than the Grom, with base-level models running $4,349. There is, perhaps, another big reason for the price difference, as Honda Monkeys come standard with anti-lock brakes (or ABS for short), a feature that is only available on more expensive trims of the Grom.\nLike the Grom, however, Monkeys also come stock with Programmed Fuel Injection, a 5-speed transmission, and a 124cc engine, with the last factor meaning you'll face some of the same highway legality concerns. While the builds are roughly the same size, the Monkey is just a little taller and heavier than its counterpart. Honda equips Monkeys with a twin-shock setup to help smooth out the ride, with an analog-inspired digital speedometer adding to its vintage appeal."

      "text": "When Did Yamaha Start Making Dirt Bikes? All About Its First Off-Road Model\nIt was 1955 when Yamaha Motor Co. was founded, expanding the Japanese company's focus from manufacturing musical instruments to motorcycles. To no surprise, the company applied the same precision techniques used to manufacture its beloved pianos to its burgeoning line of two-wheeled vehicles. The first Yamaha motorbike hit the streets that very same year, and Yamaha's ever-changing motorcycle lineup has ranked among the most celebrated brands in the motorcycle arena ever since.\nThough the brand has delivered its share of incredible cruisers and road racers, Yamaha has more than made a name for itself in the off-road sector, with its trail-ready builds becoming a constant podium presence in racing circuits. That may come as a surprise to some, if only because Yamaha didn't actually make its first proper dirt bike until the late 1960s. That era saw Yamaha's design team release a few signature off-road vehicles in the Trailmaster, the YX26, and the legendary DT-1 \u2014 the latter of which is regarded as its first proper production dirt bike. Here are a few other things you should know about the early days of Yamaha's off-road program.\nThe Trailmaster was one of Yamaha's first off-road ready bikes\nFirst released in 1964, Yamaha's Trailmaster bikes arrived with small-displacement scramblers that were a little more powerful than a scooter and, as the build's name implies, were tough enough for light trail riding. Given its versatility, the Trailmaster was popular with riders looking to do a little off-roading.\nThose early Trailmasters were hardly the torquey beasts Yamaha has come to be known for. If one were so inclined, they could argue they were the company's first real entry into the dirt bike game. You could probably point to the redesigned Trailmasters that hit the market in 1967 as proof that Yamaha was looking to bolster its presence in the off-road motorcycle market, as those arrived looking closer in style to the classic dirt bikes that came before and after.\nOf course, even Yamaha's redesigned Trailmasters were not explicitly designed for off-road adventures, with the bike's trail readiness arguably serving as an added bonus to its round-the-town functionality. That much was evident by the baggage rack that still accompanied the bikes after the redesign and the less-than-torquey 96.8cc engines that powered them. Even Cycle World undercut its off-road cred in its otherwise glowing 1967 review of the new Trailmaster, likening the bike to a trail scooter. Still, as an early progenitor to what was coming from Yamaha's off-road builds, its importance cannot be overlooked.\nYamaha's first trail bike was a game-changing concept\nThe DT-1 was conceived for American West Coast off-road enthusiasts at the request of the U.S. subsidiary Yamaha International Corporation (YIC for short). YIC was looking for a production bike that met three relatively simple criteria. First, it had to have a 250cc engine. Second, they wanted the design to possess both motocross and trail elements. Finally, they wanted a bike that could be comfortably ridden both on and off-road.\nThe first request was easy enough, as Yamaha had already developed a few 250cc builds. The company had also sought to bolster its motocross profile in the 250cc arena with the YX26, a factory racer whose development overlapped with the DT-1. Since the YX26 was the first to hit the motocross circuit in 1967, it's widely regarded as the \"mother\" of the DT-1, which debuted later that same year.\nAs the YX26 was built specifically for off-road use, some might argue it is technically Yamaha's first proper dirt bike. It did not, however, meet all the criteria set forth by YIC. It was also not a proper production model, so the Yamaha design team continued to eye the DT-1 as its purpose-built production dirt bike. That meant slimming the chassis, fitting it with four-inch block-pattern tires knobby enough for the trail but smooth enough for the road, and redesigning its 250cc engine to a torque-heavy two-stroke model that delivered 22hp. In doing so, they delivered an off-road machine that trail enthusiasts could ride to their next adventure on any given roadway.\nThe DT-1 forever changed Yamaha's off-road game\nYamaha's design team ultimately let its counterparts at YIC decide if it had successfully accomplished the mission of producing a purpose-built production dirt bike. Reviews from the States were overwhelmingly positive, and so, sensing it may have a hit on its hands, Yamaha tripled the DT-1's initial production run from its planned 4,000 units to a whopping 12,000 units.\nThe gamble paid off. AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame inductee Tom White called the dual-purpose build's debut the star of the 1967 Cycle World Show and claimed to have ordered several DT-1s to sell the next day. The bike also proved immensely popular with U.S. off-roaders, thanks in no small part to the power output, which could be bolstered with a Genuine Yamaha Tuning kit. Motocross riders naturally turned to the GYT kit to boost the output of their race day bikes, with the DT-1 soon taking the checkered flag on dirt tracks the world over.\nUltimately, Yamaha sold an estimated 50,000 DT-1s in its first year of production, with the bike proving as popular in the Japanese market as it was in the U.S. It also more or less put Yamaha on the map in terms of the off-road arena, clearing the way for the many celebrated dirt bikes that would follow. All things considered, the DT-1 likely ranks among the most important bikes Yamaha has ever built."

      "text": "How Yamaha Went 'Ladies Only' To Try To Get Women Into The '70s Motorcycle Scene\nIn 1977, Yamaha launched the Passol with a mission to get more women on the road. With women's needs in mind, Yamaha designed the Passol to be affordable, compact, and easy-to-use. Running on an automatic transmission, the scooter had a low seat height (680mm), a lightweight frame (45kg), and an overall cute appearance with color options. Aside from this, Yamaha made the Passol with thoughtful design considerations for the female experience, such as its iconic \"step-through\" layout which helped women with skirts get on easily.\nTo reach its intended audience, Yamaha's marketing strategy involved encouraging women to try it for themselves by positioning their events near places they frequented, such as supermarkets. Aside from campaigns around how enjoyable and \"gentle\" the experience is \u2014 and how close it is to riding a bicycle \u2014 Yamaha also opened riding schools for new riders. Not to mention, one of the more interesting ways Yamaha supported its commitment to women at the time was behind the scenes with its all-female assembly lines.\nIn 2001, the Passol was re-launched as an electric commuter during the 35th Tokyo Motor Show to critical acclaim. After its release, the Passol snagged several awards, including a Grand Prize win for Energy Conservation and the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy Director-General's Prize. In the years that followed, the Passol also won other accolades for its eco-friendly design, including the Good Design Awards (2003), Environment Minister's Award (2004), and so on.\n[Featured image by Rainmaker47 via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY-SA 4.0]\nThe importance of developing bikes for women\nDespite making up half the world's population, women often get the short end of the stick when it comes to automotive design and safety. For example, car crash dummies, which are used to evaluate overall vehicle safety before their commercial release, have been around since 1968. But for the longest time, these crash dummies were only based on the average male body.\nIt took over half a century before they designed a crash dummy that better represented the anatomy of the female body \u2014 and was not just a smaller version of the male one. Until today, the consequences remain deadly for women, especially in the case of collisions. In a report by Consumer Reports, it shared multiple studies claiming that women are significantly more at risk than men for injuries in car crashes, regardless if they wear a seatbelt as a driver or front passenger (17%), as well as in an event of a frontal crash (73%).\nAlthough it may take time for the industry as a whole to prioritize women's experiences on the road, efforts by companies like Yamaha to cater to women's needs shouldn't be understated. While the Yamaha Passol is no longer in production, Yamaha continues to provide women-friendly motorcycle options, even if they're not specifically marketed for them. For example, Yamaha has bikes designed for people who need low seat heights \u2014 like the Yamaha V Star 250 \u2014 and beginner-friendly bikes, like the Yamaha MT-03."

      "text": "This Yamaha YSR50 Might Not Be Practical, But It Looks Fun To Ride\nEveryone loves the aesthetic of a classic racing motorcycle. They're sleek, colorful, and look great zooming around the track. The Yamaha automotive brand (not to be confused with the company that makes your musical keyboard) has certainly made quite a few motorcycles that fit this bill over the decades, with one of its classic creations being the YZR500 factory racer. If you were browsing through pictures of bikes similar to that model, one you may have stumbled upon is the YSR50, originally produced back in 1986.\nIf you saw a picture of the YSR50 by itself, you probably wouldn't think much of it beyond its nifty red and white coloring and swoopy body. However, there's something you wouldn't realize about this bike unless someone were standing next to it: it's positively tiny. This micro replica bike is only 930mm tall, or a little over 3 feet, and weighs only 165 pounds, even with a full tank of gas. All in all, it looks more like something you'd buy for your kids at the toy store than something an adult would ride. Don't be fooled, though, because good things come in small packages. The YSR50 may be a tight squeeze for a seasoned rider, but it is a genuine motorcycle, and it can scoot you around with the best of them.\nThe YSR50 was equipped with a race-ready 49cc two-stroke engine\nAccording to Yamaha's records, the YSR50 was designed to be a scaled-down micro-racer version of the YZR500, something intended to appeal \"to the spirit of race enthusiasts in a playful way.\"\n\"Playful\" is a good choice of words, as it looks like a toy. The original English magazine advertisement (PDF) echoed this playful vibe, stating \"Just about everybody could end up riding one, provided they're small-minded enough.\"\nHowever, the YSR50 is no toy, and you definitely shouldn't put your kids on it. This little wonder is equipped with a two-stroke single-cylinder engine rated at 49cc, plus a return type 5-speed transmission, front disc brakes, and several other bells and whistles that you'd find on a professional-grade racing motorcycle. If you really crank it up, you can get a maximum performance of 7 horsepower at 8,800 rotations per minute.\nThe YSR50 had a standard cruising speed of around 37 miles per hour, but if you put the pedal down, you could see top speeds of around 40 to 50 miles per hour. It's maybe a little low for a high-speed highway, but that's more than enough to be street legal, and fearsome besides.\nDuring the YSR50's heyday in the late 80s, early 90s, it was the king of the mini-bike racing scene, as it was small enough to pass amongst its contemporaries, yet powerful enough to outrace all of them. If you can find a YSR50 nowadays, they're an absolute blast to zoom around on the open road. Just make sure to wear a helmet."
