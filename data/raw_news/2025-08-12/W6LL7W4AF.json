  "description": "A rare Reformation sale kicked off this morning. Here's what our editors recommend buying.",
  "content": "With fall on the horizon, it\u2019s time to start thinking about your transitional wardrobe. So the latest Reformation sale couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. During Reformation\u2019s Summer Sale, you can save 30% on tons of end-of-summer staples and fall essentials (like the Bethany Ballet Flat, a Forbes Vetted editor favorite). This is one of only of two major sales the brand hosts per year, so don\u2019t let it pass you by.\n\nWe expect the Reformation sale to run for at least a couple more days, but the most coveted pieces will likely sell out before today is over. With that in mind, our assistant deals editor pulled out 10 styles that she recommends adding to your cart while you still can.\n\u2022 The Bethany Ballet Flat: Now $188, Was $268 (30% Off)\n\u2022 Jadey Cashmere Oversized V-Neck Sweater: Now $209, Was $298 (30% Off)\n\u2022 Cary High Rise Slouchy Wide Leg Jeans: Now $153, Was $218 (30% Off)\n\u2022 Caspia Cashmere Cropped Cardigan: Now $139, Was $198 (30% Off)\n\u2022 Mallori Closed Toe Heel: Now $195, Was $278 (30% Off)\n\u2022 Diara Dress: Now $244, Was $348 (30% Off)\n\u2022 Faye Cotton Sweater Vest: Now $125, Was $178 (30% Off)\n\u2022 Irene Jacket: Now $279, Was $398 (30% Off)\n\u2022 Lindsey Linen Two Piece: Now $153, Was $218 (30% Off)\n\u2022 Oversized Patrizia Bag: Now $419, Was $598 (30% Off)\n\nThis slouchy wide-leg jean fits like your classic no-stretch vintage denim.

This style\u2019s cut is relaxed but chic; easy to dress up or down, and available in 11 patterns and colorways. (If you prefer a 90s straight cut, the Val 90s Mid Rise Straight Jeans are on sale as well.)",

      "text": "When I first heard of Rothy\u2019s years ago, I was immediately intrigued by its sustainable, machine-washable styles. Since then, the brand has only grown in popularity, becoming a reliable choice for commuters, frequent travelers and anyone seeking durable, low-maintenance footwear. Our editors (myself included) swear by several of the its designs, thanks to their non-existent break-in period, all-day comfort and breathable materials. If you\u2019ve yet to try the brand out, there\u2019s an unofficialy Rothy\u2019s sale happening right now, and several of our favorite pairs including The Buckle Slide and The Square Mary Jane are up to 48% off.\nRothy\u2019s Final Few sale section features highly rated styles in select colorways\u2014like The Loafer and The Point\u2014at varying reduced prices. These discounted pairs are on their way out for good (each purchase is final sale), making it the perfect opportunity to try out some of the brand\u2019s beloved designs without paying full price. Up ahead, find out which Rothy\u2019s shoes our editors own and love, alongside other standout styles that are available until stock runs out.\nI picked up this pair of buckle slides back in early spring, and have worn them on multiple occasions since\u2014to the pool, to rooftop happy hour and while running errands around my neighborhood. They look way sleeker than most slide sandals I\u2019ve owned, but they\u2019re extremely comfortable. I noticed the cushioned support from the firm, contoured footbed the very first time I slipped them on. Plus, the straps don\u2019t ever dig into my skin. I can walk in these for hours and not feel the slightest bit of pain at the end of the day. They are currently discounted in black (my chosen color), alongside two other neutral shade options.\nThese Lightweight Block Heel Sandals Are 32% Off\nRothy's The Knot Sandal (Women's)\nAt the beginning of the summer, our special projects editor Jennifer Ferrise was looking for a block heel sandal that she could wear around New York City without getting blisters. She landed on this pair from Rothy\u2019s\u2014her very first purchase from the brand\u2014and was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable and lightweight they were. \u201cThey have a plush, cushioned footbed and have never hurt my feet, even after walking around all day. I love that they look polished enough for both the daytime and evening, and that you can also toss them in the washer for a quick and easy clean,\u201d she says.\nThis OG Rothy's Design Is Available In Nearly All Sizes\nRothy's The Loafer (Women's)\nSenior updates editor Karen Tietjen has owned this loafer from Rothy\u2019s for quite some time, and still wears them to this day. \"I have a wider foot and can attest that these are comfy (and work way better for my foot shape than The Point flats, as much as it pains me to admit).

Its Anniversary Sale takes place once a year over the summer and is known for major price cuts across all categories. Both sales always have notable offers, but the Anniversary Sale typically includes steeper discounts on more coveted items, as well as deals on fall and winter styles.\nNordstrom cardholders always get early access to the sale. Each membership tier, determined by how much you\u2019ve spent at the department store over the past year, is allotted an early shopping window leading up to the sale. Icons (cardholders who\u2019ve spent $15,000 or more in the past year) were able to start shopping July 8; Ambassadors (cardholders who\u2019ve spent $5,000 or more in the past year) started July 9; and Influencers (cardholders who\u2019ve spent $500 or more in the past year) were given access July 10.
