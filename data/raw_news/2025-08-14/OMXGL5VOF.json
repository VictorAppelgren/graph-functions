  "content": "OWINGS MILLS, Md. \u2014 Viktor Hovland posted a 67 to take the clubhouse lead before storms interrupted play Thursday afternoon during the first round of the BMW Championship, but Scottie Scheffler birdied his final hole after the rain to best him with a 4-under-66.\n\n\u201cI had a great start and a great finish. In between was a little bit \u2019meh,\u2019\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I felt like I hit a lot of fairways today. I think I maybe missed one on 16 and I think I missed a fairway on 10, but other than that, I was in the fairway a lot today. Last week I felt like I didn\u2019t drive it as good as I would have hoped to, so going into this week, I felt like I definitely drove it better around this course.\u201d\n\nHovland carded six birdies and three, front-nine bogeys for his round, including birdies on both par 5s, Nos. 4 and 16. Scheffler matched him on birdies, including three of the final four holes, while committing one fewer bogey. Scheffler finished his round by curving a nearly 26-foot putt into the hole from just inside the fringe on No. 18.\n\n\u201cThe irons were pretty solid,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cHit a lot of really nice iron shots, especially kind of coming down the stretch because there\u2019s some pretty tough finishing holes in there. Like 17 and 18, hit a nice 5-iron into 17, made the putt, and even 18, I\u2019m there with a 6-iron into a pretty narrow green.\u201d\n\nScheffler, the world No. 1, does not have to worry about his FedEx Cup Playoffs status. Hovland\u2019s round, meanwhile, tremendously boosted his chances of staying inside the top 30 and advancing to next week\u2019s Tour Championship. A FedEx Cup champion in 2023, Hovland entered this week on the playoff bubble at No. 28, falling two spots after finishing tied for 32nd at last week\u2019s St. Jude Championship.\n\n\u201cI guess there\u2019s something about kind of having your back against the wall and having to perform,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cI think sometimes I can get too much into my head about swing mechanics and all that stuff, which I still think is important, but I think when you\u2019re in the playoff and I\u2019m 28th and top 30 advances, it\u2019s like, all right, we kind of have to forget about that stuff a little bit this week and just go out there and play, and I do think that\u2019s definitely helping me in the short term.\u201d\n\nPlay was halted for more than two hours in the mid-afternoon as lightning and intense rain swept across Caves Valley\u2019s rolling terrain.\n\n\u201cGolf course is in good shape. We\u2019ll see how it plays over the next few days,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI would have preferred to not get the rain to keep the firmness of the golf course, but overall we\u2019ll see how it develops and changes over the next few days, and we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nAlong with Hovland, 12 other players were able to finish their rounds before the suspension, including Michael Kim, who recorded three birdies on the front nine for a two-under 68.\n\n\u201cI felt like every part of my game was pretty solid. Only missed like one or two drives off the tee and hit some wedges close,\u201d Kim said. \u201cPutted it nice, chipped it pretty nice. Felt like everything was pretty good today.\u201d\n\nKim needs an even stronger push than Hovland to make it to East Lake for the first time. He began today at 42nd in the standings, but was projected just inside the top 30 following his round.\n\n\u201cIf you had told me I\u2019d be top 50, I would have just signed right there and just watched everyone else play,\u201d Kim said. \u201cBut once I had a really good stretch in that beginning to the middle part of the season, I really wanted to make the push for the Tour Championship.\u201d",
