  "description": "A manhunt continues for a third day in Montana for an Army veteran suspected of killing four people at a bar.",
  "content": "Montana Atty. Gen. Austin Knudsen speaks to reporters Sunday about the manhunt, now in its third day.\n\nThe Army veteran suspected of killing four people at a Montana bar last week was still at large Sunday and may still be armed after escaping in a stolen vehicle containing clothes and camping gear, officials said.\n\nAuthorities believe 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown killed four people on Friday morning at the Owl Bar in Anaconda, Mont., about 75 miles southeast of Missoula in a valley hemmed in by mountains.\n\nMontana Atty. Gen. Austin Knudsen said at a news conference Sunday that Brown committed the shooting with a rifle that law enforcement believes was his personal weapon.\n\nThe victims, ranging in age from 59 to 74, were a female bartender and three male patrons, Knudsen said.\n\nKnudsen warned residents in the town of about 9,000 people that Brown, who lived next door to the bar where he was a regular, could come back to the area.\n\n\u201cThis is an unstable individual who walked in and murdered four people in cold blood for no reason whatsoever. So there absolutely is concern for the public,\u201d Knudsen said.\n\nNumerous public events were canceled over the weekend as the search entered its third day, according to local Facebook pages.\n\nInvestigators are considering all possible options for Brown\u2019s whereabouts, the attorney general said. That includes searching the woods where Brown hunted and camped while he was a kid. But Knudsen noted that, during peak tourist season in western Montana, some law enforcement officials would have to return to their local jurisdictions for their regular responsibilities.\n\nBrown served in the Army as an armor crewman from 2001-05 and deployed to Iraq from early 2004 until March 2005, according to Lt. Col. Ruth Castro, an Army spokesperson. Brown was in the Montana National Guard from 2006 to March 2009, Castro said, and left the service with the rank of sergeant.\n\nKnudsen said Sunday that Brown was known to local law enforcement. It was widely believed that he knew at least some of the victims, Knudsen said.\n\nLaw enforcement released a photograph of Brown from surveillance video taken shortly after the fatal shootings. He appeared to be barefoot and in minimal clothing.\n\nAuthorities believe Brown ditched the vehicle he escaped in and stole a different one that had camping gear, shoes and clothes in it \u2014 leaving open the possibility that Brown is now fully clothed.\n\nThe last time that law enforcement saw Brown was Friday afternoon, but there was \u201csome confusion\u201d because there were multiple vehicles involved, Knudsen said.\n\nThere is a $7,500 reward for any information that leads to Brown\u2019s capture and conviction.\n\n\u201cThis is still Montana. Montanans know how to take care of themselves. But please, if you have any sightings, call 911,\u201d Knudsen said.\n\nRiddle writes for the Associated Press.",

      "text": "- Share via\n- Celaya\u2019s mayor replaced most of the local police force with national guard troops after a wave of cartel violence and the assassination of a mayoral candidate.\n- More municipalities are leaning on the military for local policing.\n- Police corruption is endemic in much of Mexico. One officer in Celaya warned her sister to be wary.\nCELAYA, Mexico \u2014 On a sunny spring day last year, a young attorney named Gisela Gayt\u00e1n kicked off her campaign for mayor in this gritty Mexican city.\nUnder her blouse she wore a ballistic vest.\nCelaya had become the epicenter of a bloody cartel war, with one of the highest homicide rates in the world, and a local police force that appeared powerless to stop it.\n\u201cWe must recover the security that we so long for,\u201d Gayt\u00e1n, 38, wrote on social media before setting out that day.\nAs she shook hands at an event on the outskirts of town, a man approached, raised a gun and shot her in the head.\nAfter her funeral, where a priest lamented \u201ca death caused by murderers who believe they control society,\u201d local Morena party leaders picked a new candidate: Juan Miguel Ram\u00edrez S\u00e1nchez, a bespectacled former university rector who had worked on Gayt\u00e1n\u2019s campaign.\nRam\u00edrez believed that one of Celaya\u2019s most urgent problems was its police, who instead of fighting organized crime appeared to be involved in it.\nHis son-in-law had been killed in a case that was still unsolved, and officers had demanded bribes and obstructed the investigation. Police misconduct was well documented: Local cops were prosecuted for abusing detainees and participating in kidnappings and even homicides.\nRam\u00edrez won the election. And in his first act as mayor, he fired 340 of the roughly 600 officers on the force. Then \u2014 as officials across Mexico have been doing for nearly two decades now \u2014 he called in federal troops.\nMexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n first deployed soldiers into the streets to fight drug traffickers in 2006, promising then that the military would stay only until police could be reformed.\nIn the years since, leaders across the political spectrum have repeatedly vowed to better train and root out corruption among the country\u2019s cops \u2014 a step that security experts agree is essential to reducing crime and violence.\nBut with the exception of Mexico\u2019s capital and a few other major cities, those efforts have lost steam. Officials have slashed funding for state and local police forces, and disbanded the federal police altogether. Cops continue to be near-universally reviled, with federal surveys showing that 9 out of 10 Mexicans don\u2019t trust the police.\nAt the same time, Mexico has vastly expanded the military\u2019s role in public security. There are now more soldiers, marines and members of the national guard deployed nationally than state and local police officers, according to an analysis by the Citizen Security Program at the Universidad Iberoamericana. In most parts of the country, there are fewer state and local police today than there were when the drug war began in 2006.\n\u201cThe police have been abandoned in favor of militarization,\u201d said Ernesto L\u00f3pez Portillo, a researcher who leads the Iberoamericana program.\nThere is little evidence that the strategy has worked. Homicides remain persistently high, although they have dipped slightly in recent years. And cartels have only expanded their reach, with a U.S. military analysis finding that criminal groups control more than one-third of Mexico.\nYet officials continue to embrace militarization as the country\u2019s primary security strategy. That even includes leftists who once fiercely warned of the dangers of ceding public security to soldiers, including President Claudia Sheinbaum and her predecessor, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador.\nThe mayor\u2019s abrupt decision to summarily replace most of the police force in Celaya, a patchwork of farmland and factories in central Guanajuato state, is a case study in why Mexicans have lost faith in local law enforcement \u2014 and what happens when soldiers take over.\nCelaya used to be a tranquil city. Its location along a highway and railroad that stretch 600 miles to the United States drew Honda and other automakers to build plants here.\nFor years, a local criminal group called the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel quietly stole fuel from the major oil pipelines that cross the region.\nIt wasn\u2019t until the notorious Jalisco New Generation Cartel edged in several years ago that violence exploded. The groups battled for control of pipelines but also drug trafficking, extortion rackets and theft of cargo trucks.\nCelaya became synonymous with violence as criminals gunned down shopkeepers who refused to pay extortion fees, drug users who couldn\u2019t pay their dealers and everyday citizens who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. They carried out massacres at hotels, bars and even funerals.\nBy 2024, Celaya had a homicide rate of 87 killings per 100,000 people \u2014 17 times the rate in the United States.\nIt had long been clear that the city\u2019s police force was, at best, not up to the challenge \u2014 and, at worst, deeply corrupt.\nThe 600 cops on the force in Celaya, which has a population of around half a million, were half of the 1,200 that the United Nations recommends for a city of its size. Officers were poorly trained and badly paid.\nThat made them easy targets for criminals who offered cash in exchange for intelligence, muscle or simply looking the other way when a crime was committed. When police didn\u2019t cooperate \u2014 or didn\u2019t cooperate correctly \u2014 they were often killed.\nIn 2024, a cop here was 400 times more likely to be killed than one in the United States.\nFanny Ram\u00edrez, the daughter of a street vendor and a maid, was 21 when she enrolled in Celaya\u2019s police academy. After eight years with the force, she earned just $900 a month, little more than a worker on an assembly line. Her boyfriend was also a police officer in Celaya.\nFanny warned her family to steer clear of the cops, said her sister, Elisabeth. After Elisabeth\u2019s husband witnessed a triple homicide several years ago, Fanny instructed him: \u201cGo inside and say you don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\n\u201cThe police are supposed to take care of you,\u201d Elisabeth said. \u201cBut here, we have to protect ourselves from the police.\u201d\nMayor Ram\u00edrez wasn\u2019t the first local politician to try to clean house. Previous leaders had made a show of purging dozens or even hundreds of police officers that they claimed were rotten.\nBut with most mayors serving just a single three-year term and scant public funds, reform efforts gained no traction. Experts say change takes time and requires concrete action to raise salaries, improve recruitment criteria and strengthen oversight.\nOn the national level, the approach to policing was inconsistent. Before he was elected president in 2018, L\u00f3pez Obrador criticized his predecessors for replacing police with soldiers.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t use the military to make up for the civilian government\u2019s shortcomings,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador insisted, vowing to send soldiers \u201cback to their barracks.\u201d\n1. Angel Romero, center, an instructor in defense training, teaches cadets hand to hand combat. 2. Cadets perform tactical rifle training to be officers. 3. Marcos Alfredo Morales, an active municipal police officer of 20 years, instructs cadets in practical firearm usage.\nOn taking office, he changed his tune. Facing record high homicide rates, he released a security plan that argued that taking soldiers off the streets would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d because cops were \u201ccontrolled by organized crime and moved by self-interest and corruption.\u201d\nHe dismantled the federal police, a famously corrupt force whose longtime leader was convicted in the U.S. of taking bribes from the Sinaloa cartel.\nAnd L\u00f3pez Obrador steered money once destined for local and state law enforcement to create a 120,000-officer-strong national guard, a force he vowed would be \u201cincorruptible\u201d and civilian-led, and which was supposed to take over the investigative functions of the federal police.\nIn fact, nearly 90% of the members of the national guard are former soldiers, and few have been trained to carry out investigations.\nIn Celaya, violence continued to spiral. And policing never improved.\nLast year, about a month before the mayoral candidate was cut down with bullets, Fanny set out to drop her 6-year-old daughter off at child care before starting work. She was driving a sedan that belonged to her boyfriend.\nAssailants opened fire. She and her daughter died on the spot. A few months later, Fanny\u2019s boyfriend was gunned down, too.\nNeither case has been solved, but Fanny\u2019s sister believes the deaths were connected to the boyfriend\u2019s ties to organized crime.\n1. A Celaya police officer questions a woman after a person was detained for suspicious behavior. The subject was later released when it was revealed he lived at the home with the woman. 2. National guard troops and police apprehend a subject for suspicious behavior in Celaya. 3. A fake firearm was found in the suspect\u2019s possession. He was released.\nShortly after he was elected mayor in June 2024, Ram\u00edrez said he was approached by cartel members who asked for positions in his government. He said he rebuffed them, but was shaken.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been afraid like all citizens,\u201d he said.\nHe met with Mexico\u2019s top public security official and told her he had no confidence in Celaya\u2019s police. \u201cNot all of them were bad,\u201d he said recently, \u201cbut most were.\u201d She pledged to send him 500 members of the national guard.\nThe mayor\u2019s mass firing of police faced criticism from his political opponents.\nMauro Gonz\u00e1lez Mart\u00ednez, the top security official in Guanajuato state, a former federal police officer and member of an opposition party, said national guard troops and other members of the armed forces were not equipped to fight crime.\n\u201cThe army is trained for war,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cA police officer investigates. A soldier kills.\u201d\nNancy Ang\u00e9lica Canjura Luna, an analyst at a think tank called Causa en Comun, said that while soldiers are seen as less corruptible than police because they typically come from other parts of the country, that means they know little about the region they are supposed to be protecting.\n\u201cThey are always new,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know the criminal dynamics and they don\u2019t know the territory itself.\u201d\nBut others in Celaya, exhausted by years of violence, welcomed the troops and two high-ranking military officers loaned to the city to lead its new security force as a show of strength.\nArmy Col. Pablo Mu\u00f1oz Huitr\u00f3n and Lt. Col. Bernardo Cajero rode into town in an armed convoy, dressed in camouflage fatigues. As they strode into City Hall, they were flanked by soldiers.\nMu\u00f1oz was quickly sworn in as Celaya\u2019s secretary of public security, a role traditionally occupied by civilians, but which in many cities is now filled by current or former soldiers or marines. Cajero was tasked with leading the officers who had survived the purge and the guardsman who now worked alongside them.\nWhen Cajero switched from his olive green army fatigues to a blue police uniform, he was startled by how differently people treated him.\n\u201cMy first realization was how much people hate the police,\u201d he said.\nThe pair, who had served in cartel hot spots like Tamaulipas and Michoac\u00e1n, devised a plan. The city\u2019s remaining police would patrol alongside members of the military to reduce opportunities for corruption.\nSecurity forces would focus on improving response times for 911 calls and increasing the number of checkpoints around the city to make sure drivers weren\u2019t carrying guns or drugs.\nCelaya\u2019s leaders say crime rates have fallen.\nBetween January and June, there were 158 homicides in the city, according to the local government, down from 257 during the same time last year.\nBut high-profile acts of violence continue.\n1. A woman holds the daughter of a taxi driver who was shot and killed in May in Celaya, Guanajuato. The young girl was in the passenger seat. 2. Police and paramedics at the scene where a taxi driver was shot and killed.\nCajero was patrolling on a recent night when the radio crackled with a report of a homicide. His convoy raced to an intersection where a taxi lay overturned. The driver had been shot. His 12-year-old daughter, who had been in the passenger seat, survived but was in shock.\n\u201cTake me to my father,\u201d she wailed as a paramedic tended to her wounds.\nEarlier this year, the mayor\u2019s bodyguard was shot to death outside his own home. Ram\u00edrez, who cries while remembering him, said the perpetrators were likely criminals angry about his new security plan. \u201cObviously it was to send me a message,\u201d Ram\u00edrez said.\nSome locals have bristled at the presence of federal forces in their streets. Alejandro, a 24-year-old Uber driver who did not give his last name because of fear of reprisals, said he had been stopped frequently by national guard members, and treated as roughly as by police while they reviewed his car and identity. \u201cThey\u2019re all the same,\u201d he said.\nThis summer, 11 members of the national guard were charged with theft after they were caught extracting fuel from an illegal tap not far from Celaya.\n\u201cHow can we trust people who are robbing from us?\u201d Alejandro said. \u201cThat\u2019s not logical.\u201d\nThe front-runner in Mexico\u2019s presidential election brought down crime as Mexico City mayor. Can Claudia Sheinbaum save Mexico from rampant violence?\nSheinbaum won the presidency last year in part on a promise to replicate the security strategy she had embraced as mayor of Mexico City, which focused on improving investigations, professionalizing cops and implementing community policing models developed in U.S. cities such as Oakland. But as president she has taken few steps toward police reform, and she recently pushed a constitutional amendment that puts the national guard permanently under military control.\nThe lack of federal help has made it challenging for Celaya\u2019s efforts to rebuild its police force.\nOn a recent afternoon at the city\u2019s aging police academy, young officers rappelled down walls and simulated hand-to-hand combat. They practiced wielding guns but not actually shooting them because the cost of bullets was too high.\nOne recent graduate, 29-year-old Jose Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez Herrera, decided to join the police after his brother, a merchant, was killed by criminals.\nHern\u00e1ndez said instructors rarely discussed how police should handle bribery offers from organized crime, even if it may be only a matter of time before he is approached.\n\u201cYou\u2019re never 100% prepared,\u201d he said, adding that he would refuse to cooperate for his brother\u2019s memory, and because he wants his son to live in a city where he can trust police. \u201cIf you really want to change your society, you have to make the right decision, even if it\u2019s the more complicated one.\u201d\nRam\u00edrez has touted young officers like Hern\u00e1ndez as the future of Celaya. But the academy is graduating fewer than 20 officers a month, and is struggling to recruit new officers. Pay starts at just $800 a month.\nRecently, the city put out a call to current and former soldiers, asking them to take jobs on the force.\nEstefania Vela, a human rights lawyer at a think tank called Intersecta, worries militarization is near-sighted.\n\u201cNobody disputes that the police have problems,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what are you doing to fix those problems?\u201d\nOfficials say the new force is not intended to be permanent. But how long will they stay? And what happens when they leave?\n\u201cIt\u2019s necessary today,\u201d said Mu\u00f1oz, the colonel in charge of the deployment. \u201cTomorrow, who knows?\u201d"

      "text": "South Koreans are obsessed with Netflix\u2019s \u2018K-pop Demon Hunters.\u2019 Here\u2019s why\n- Share via\nSEOUL \u2014 When South Koreans start to obsess over a movie or TV series, they abbreviate its name, a distinction given to Netflix\u2019s latest hit \u201cK-pop Demon Hunters.\u201d In media headlines and in every corner of the internet, the American-made film is now universally referred to as \u201cKeh-deh-hun\u201d \u2014 the first three syllables of the title when read aloud in Korean.\nAnd audiences are already clamoring for a sequel.\nThe animated film follows a fictional South Korean girl group named \u201cHUNTR/X\u201d as its three members \u2014 Rumi, Mira and Zoey \u2014 try to deliver the world from evil through the power of song and K-pop fandom.\nSince its release in June, it has become the most watched original animated film in Netflix history, with millions of views worldwide, including the U.S. and South Korea, where its soundtrack has topped the charts on local music streaming platform Melon. Fans have also cleaned out the gift shop at the National Museum of Korea, which has run out of a traditional tiger pin that resembles one of the movie\u2019s characters.\nMuch of the film\u2019s popularity in South Korea is rooted in its keenly observed details and references to Korean folklore, pop culture and even national habits \u2014 the result of having a production team filled with K-pop fans, as well as a group research trip to South Korea that co-director Maggie Kang led in order to document details as minute as the appearance of local pavement.\nThere are nods to traditional Korean folk painting, a Korean guide to the afterlife, the progenitors of K-pop and everyday mannerisms. In one scene, at a table in a restaurant where the three girls are eating, viewers might notice how the utensils are laid atop a napkin, an essential ritual for dining out in South Korea \u2014 alongside pouring cups of water for everyone at the table.\n\u201cThe more that I watch \u2018Keh-deh-hun,\u2019 the more that I notice the details,\u201d South Korean music critic Kim Yoon-ha told local media last month. \u201cIt managed to achieve a verisimilitude that would leave any Korean in awe.\u201d\n::\nDespite its subject matter and association with the \u201cK-wave,\u201d that catchall term for any and all Korean cultural exports, \u201cK-pop Demon Hunters,\u201d at least in the narrowest sense, doesn\u2019t quite fit the bill.\nProduced by Sony Pictures and directed by Korean Canadian Kang and Chris Appelhans \u2014 who has held creative roles on other animated films such as \u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cFantastic Mr. Fox\u201d \u2014 the movie is primarily in English and geared toward non-Korean audiences. But its popularity in South Korea is another sign that the boundaries of the K-wave are increasingly fluid \u2014 and that, with more and more diaspora Korean artists entering the mix, it flows in the opposite direction, too.\nThose barriers have already long since broken down in music: many K-pop artists and songwriters are non-Korean or part of the Korean diaspora, reflecting the genre\u2019s history of foreign influences such as Japanese pop or American hip-hop.\n\u201cOnce a cultural creation acquires a universality, you can\u2019t just confine it to the borders of the country of origin, which is where K-pop is today,\u201d said Kim Il-joong, director of the content business division at the Korea Creative Content Agency, a government body whose mission is to promote South Korean content worldwide. \u201cDespite what the name \u2018K-pop\u2019 suggests, it is really a global product.\u201d\nIn \u201cK-pop Demon Hunters,\u201d Zoey is a rapper from Burbank. In addition, the soundtrack was written and performed by a team that includes producers, artists and choreographers associated with some of the biggest real-life K-pop groups of the past decade.\nStreaming productions are increasingly flying multiple flags, too: Apple TV\u2019s \u201cPachinko\u201d or Netflix\u2019s \u201cXO, Kitty\u201d are both American productions that were filmed in South Korea. But few productions have been able to inspire quite the same level of enthusiasm as \u201cK-pop Demon Hunters,\u201d whose charm for many South Koreans is how accurately it captures local idiosyncrasies and contemporary life.\nWhile flying in their private jet, the three girls are shown sitting on the floor even though there is a sofa right beside them. This tendency to use sofas as little more than backrests is an endless source of humor and self-fascination among South Koreans, most of whom would agree that the centuries-old custom of sitting on the floor dies hard.\nSouth Korean fans and media have noted that the characters correctly pronounce \u201cramyeon,\u201d or Korean instant noodles. The fact that ramyeon is often conflated with Japanese ramen \u2014 which inspired the invention of the former decades ago \u2014 has long been a point of exasperation for many South Koreans and local ramyeon companies, which point to the fact that the Korean adaption has since evolved into something distinct.\nIt\u2019s a small difference \u2014 the Korean version is pronounced \u201crah myun\u201d \u2014 but one that it pays to get right in South Korea.\nThe girls\u2019 cravings for ramyeon during their flight also caught the eye of Ireh, a member of the real-life South Korean girl group Purple Kiss who praised the film\u2019s portrayals of life as a K-pop artist.\n\u201cI don\u2019t normally eat ramyeon, but whenever I go on tour, I end up eating it,\u201d she said in a recent interview with local media. \u201cThe scene reminded me of myself.\u201d\nSouth Korean fans have also been delighted by a pair of animals, Derpy and Sussy, which borrow from jakhodo, a genre of traditional Korean folk painting in which tigers and magpies are depicted side by side, popularized during the Joseon Dynasty in the 19th century.\nIn the film, Derpy is the fluorescent tiger with goggle eyes that always appears with its sidekick, a three-eyed bird named Sussy.\nThough they have long since been extinct, tigers were once a feared presence on the Korean peninsula, at times coming down from the mountains to terrorize the populace. They were also revered as talismans that warded off evil spirits. But much like Derpy itself, jakhodo reimagined tigers as friendlier, oftentimes comical beings. Historians have interpreted this as the era\u2019s political satire: the magpie, audacious in the presence of a great predator, represented the common man standing up to the nobility.\nThe movie is peppered with homages to Korean artists throughout history who are seen today as the progenitors of contemporary K-pop. There are apparent nods to the \u201cJeogori Sisters,\u201d a three-piece outfit that was active from 1939 to 1945 and is often described as Korea\u2019s first girl group, followed by the Kim Sisters, another three-piece that found success in the U.S., performing in Las Vegas and appearing on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show.\u201d\nLongtime K-pop fans might recognize the demon hunters from the 1990s as S.E.S., a pioneering girl group formed by S.M. Entertainment, the label behind present-day superstars Aespa and Red Velvet. (Bada, S.E.S.\u2019s main vocalist, recently covered \u201cGolden,\u201d the film\u2019s headline track, on YouTube.)\nFor a long time, South Korean audiences have often complained about outside depictions of the country as inauthentic and out of touch. Not anymore.\n\u201cKorea wasn\u2019t just shown as an extra add-on as it has been for so long,\u201d Kim said. \u201c\u2018K-pop Demon Hunters\u2019 did such a great job depicting Korea in a way that made it instantly recognizable to audiences here.\u201d"

      "text": "Brutal arrest of Black student shows benefits of camera in car in recording police stops\n- Share via\nA video that captured the brutal arrest of a Black college student pulled from his car and beaten by officers in Florida has led to an investigation and calls for motorists to consider protecting themselves by placing a camera inside their vehicles.\nWilliam McNeil Jr. captured his February traffic stop on his cellphone camera, which was mounted above his dashboard. It offered a crucial view, providing the only clear footage of the violence by officers, including punches to his head that can\u2019t clearly be seen in officer body-camera video released by the Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Office.\nSince McNeil had the foresight to record the encounter from inside the vehicle, \u201cwe got to see firsthand and hear firsthand and put it all in context what driving while Black is in America,\u201d said civil rights attorney Ben Crump, one of several lawyers advising McNeil.\n\u201cAll the young people should be recording these interactions with law enforcement,\u201d Crump said. \u201cBecause what it tells us, just like with George Floyd, if we don\u2019t record the video, we can see what they put in the police report with George Floyd before they realized the video existed.\u201d\nMcNeil was pulled over that day because officers said his headlights should have been on because of bad weather, his lawyers said. His camera shows him asking the officers what he did wrong. Seconds later, an officer smashes his window, strikes him as he sat in the driver\u2019s seat and then pulls him from the car and punches him in the head. After being knocked to the ground, McNeil was punched six more times in his right thigh, a police report states.\nThe incident reports don\u2019t describe the officer punching McNeil in the head. The officer, who pulled McNeil over and then struck him, described the force this way in his report: \u201cPhysical force was applied to the suspect and he was taken to the ground.\u201d\nBut after McNeil posted his video online last month and it went viral, the Sheriff\u2019s Office launched an internal investigation, which is ongoing. A sheriff\u2019s spokesperson declined to comment about the case last week, citing pending litigation, though no lawsuit has been filed over the arrest.\nMcNeil said the ordeal left him traumatized, with a brain injury, a broken tooth and stitches in his lip. His attorneys accused the Sheriff\u2019s Office of trying to cover up what really happened.\n\u201cOn Feb. 19, 2025, Americans saw what America is,\u201d said another of McNeil\u2019s lawyers, Harry Daniels. \u201cWe saw injustice. You saw abuse of police power. But most importantly we saw a young man that had a temperament to control himself in the face of brutality.\u201d\nThe traffic stop, he said, was not only racially motivated, \u201cit was unlawful, and everything that stemmed from that stop was unlawful.\u201d\nMcNeil is hardly the first Black motorist to record video during a traffic stop that turned violent \u2014 Philando Castile\u2019s girlfriend livestreamed the bloody aftermath of his death during a 2016 traffic stop near Minneapolis. But McNeil\u2019s arrest serves as a reminder of how cellphone video can show a different version of events from what is described in police reports, his lawyers said.\nChristopher Mercado, who retired as a lieutenant from the New York Police Department, agreed with McNeil\u2019s legal team\u2019s suggestion that drivers should record their police interactions and that a camera mounted inside a driver\u2019s car could offer a crucial point of view.\n\u201cUse technology to your advantage,\u201d said Mercado, an adjunct assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing nefarious about it. It\u2019s actually a smart thing, in my opinion.\u201d\nRod Brunson, chairman of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland, said he thinks it\u2019s a good idea for citizens to film encounters with police \u2014 as long as doing so doesn\u2019t make the situation worse.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a form of protection \u2014 it\u2019s safeguarding them against false claims of criminal behavior or interfering with officers, etcetera,\u201d Brunson said.\nAlthough the Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Office declined to speak to the Associated Press last week, Sheriff T.K. Waters has spoken publicly about McNeil\u2019s arrest since video of the encounter went viral. He challenged some of the allegations made by McNeil\u2019s lawyers, noting that McNeil was told more than a half-dozen times to exit the vehicle.\nAt a news conference last month, Waters also highlighted images of a knife in McNeil\u2019s car. The officer who punched him wrote in his police report that McNeil reached toward the floor of the car, where deputies later found the knife.\nCrump, though, said McNeil\u2019s video shows that he \u201cnever reaches for anything,\u201d and a second officer wrote in his report that McNeil kept his hands up as the other officer smashed the car window.\nA camera inside a motorist\u2019s vehicle could make up for some shortcomings of police body cams, which can have a narrow field of view that becomes more limited the closer an officer gets to the person being filmed, Mercado said.\nAfter the police murder of Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020, some states and cities debated how and when citizens should be able to capture video of police. The Constitution guarantees the right to record police in public, but a point of contention in some states has been whether a civilian\u2019s recording might interfere with the ability of officers to do their job. In Louisiana, for example, a new law makes it a crime to approach within 25 feet of a police officer in certain situations.\nWaters acknowledged those limitations at a news conference last year, as he narrated video of a wild brawl between officers and a fan in the stands at EverBank Stadium during a college football game last year between Florida and Georgia.\nThe sheriff showed the officers\u2019 body-cam videos during the start of the confrontation near the top of the stadium. But when the officers subdued the suspect and were pressing against him, the footage didn\u2019t capture much, so the sheriff switched to stadium security video shot from a longer distance away.\nIn McNeil\u2019s case, the body-cam video didn\u2019t clearly capture the punches thrown. If it had, the case would have been investigated right away, the sheriff said.\nFor the last 20 years, Brunson has been interviewing young Black men in several U.S. cities about their encounters with law enforcement. When he began submitting research papers for academic review, many readers didn\u2019t believe the men\u2019s stories of being brutalized by officers.\n\u201cPeople who live in a civil society don\u2019t expect to be treated this way by the police. For them, their police interactions are mostly pleasant, mostly cordial,\u201d Brunson said.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s hard for people who don\u2019t have a tenuous relationship with the police to fathom that something like this happens,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where video does play a big part, because people can\u2019t deny what they see.\u201d\nMartin writes for the Associated Press."
