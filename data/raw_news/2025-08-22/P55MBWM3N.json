  "description": "Yahoo Finance is chronicling the latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs.",
  "content": "White House trade adviser Peter Navarro again criticized India for its ongoing purchases of Russian oil and said he anticipates the planned 50% punitive tariffs on Indian imports will take effect next week.\n\n\u201cI see that taking place,\u201d Navarro told reporters in front of the White House when asked about the tariffs on India that are set to double on Aug. 27. \u201cIndia doesn\u2019t appear to want to recognize its role in the bloodshed. It simply doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s cozying up to Xi Jinping, is what it\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nA Chinese official voiced support for India regarding US tariffs on its exports, highlighting growing cooperation between the two Asian neighbors.\n\n\u201cThe United States has imposed tariffs of up to 50% on India, and it has even threatened for more. China firmly opposes this,\u201d said China\u2019s ambassador to India, Xu Feihong.\n\nOn Thursday, the US and the EU established a written framework for the trade deal agreed to on July 27. The terms include a 15% US tariff on most EU imports: These include autos, pharmaceutical goods, semiconductors, and lumber \u2014 but not wine and spirits.\n\nThe two sides also outlined the EU's promise to remove tariffs on US industrial goods and give better access to US seafood and agricultural products.\n\nOn Wednesday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the US is content with its current tariff setup with China, signaling the Trump administration wants stability ahead of the November trade truce deadline.\n\nIn a Fox News interview, Bessent said the status quo is \"working pretty well\" and called China the biggest source of tariff revenue.\n\nBessent went on to add in a further interview with CNBC that he expects tariff revenues under President Trump to exceed his earlier $300 billion estimate, with the money going to pay down the federal debt rather than rebate checks for Americans.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump unveiled \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of US trade partners (which you can see in the graphic below).\n\nThe biggest negotiations to watch in the coming months are Canada, Mexico, and China.\n\nRead more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\n\nHere are the latest updates as the policy reverberates around the world.",

      "text": "A 15% import tariff on pharmaceutical goods from the European Union to the US is going to have a lesser impact on the pharmaceutical industry than Wall Street feared.\nBig pharmaceutical stocks like Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) rose slightly, by about 1%, in trading Thursday after the trade deal was announced, putting to rest concerns of tariffs threatened as high as 200% previously by President Trump.\n\"The two regions have established a 15% tariff cap on imported drugs from EU to the US. This is being viewed by most as both manageable and below the 20%+ rate many expected,\" wrote Mizuho's healthcare expert Jared Holz in a note to clients Thursday.\nThe deal outlined by the US and EU has multiple parts that impact the pharmaceutical industry, with some clarity still needed.\nThe first is levying either the 15% tariff or the Most Favored Nation (MFN) pricing, whichever is higher, on pharma drugs manufactured in the EU. This puts more emphasis on President Trump's efforts to equalize US drug costs to the lower prices seen in the EU and other developed nations and also impacts a smaller portion of products, as pharma executives have emphasized that most of the branded drugs sold in the US are made in the US. But questions remain on whether the finalize products, or some components, will be taxed.\n\"The United States commits to apply the higher of either the US MFN tariff rate or a tariff rate of 15 percent, comprised of the MFN tariff and a reciprocal tariff, on originating goods of the European Union,\" according to the White House statement.\nThe second part of the deal is that, as of Sept. 1, the US will enforce MFN pricing on generics and \"chemical precursors.\" The latter refers to active pharmaceutical ingredients, which are the key chemical compounds in any drug. They are cheaper to mass-produce overseas, largely in Asia or Ireland.\nExperts say that prices for generics, which account for a majority of prescriptions filled in the US, are already low.\n\"The administration is, for the time being, focusing Most Favored Nations pricing on generic products \u2014 hoping to peg US prices to that of other countries. Given the already lower cost of generic medicines and net price paid domestically, see the financial ramifications here as more limited than not. Have to look deeper at what precise drugs will be subject to this regulation but for now, not a strategy we see as stifling the industry/major players,\" Mizuho's Holz said.\nIts why big generics players, like Teva (TEVA), saw their stocks also rise on the news \u2014 up more than 4% Thursday. UBS analyst Ashwani Verma called the trade deal a positive for drugmakers in a note to clients Thursday."

      "text": "The Trump tariffs present something of a mystery. Trump's new import taxes raise the cost of many imported products by nearly 20%, on average. Yet price changes at the wholesale and retail level are nowhere near that magnitude. The higher cost of tariffs appears to be hiding deep inside global supply chains.\nOne new clue helps explain why Trump's new consumption taxes aren't fully hitting consumers just yet. Analysis by Capital Economics finds that the actual tariff rate paid on imports in June was just 9%. At the time, analysts estimated the average tariff rate to be around 15%. It turned out to be lower in reality because many US importers shifted their mix and source of imports to minimize the cost of the tariffs.\nResearch outfits such as the Yale Budget Lab, along with many private firms, have been trying to estimate average tariff rates at every step of Trump's convoluted trade war. That data helps economists estimate the effect of tariffs on the economy, while investors try to suss out which firms and sectors will be helped or hurt by the new taxes.\nEstimates of the average tariff rate have changed many times during the past six months as Trump has threatened new tariffs, imposed some, delayed others, announced trade agreements, and changed his mind. The average tariff was about 2.5% when Trump took office. It went as high as 28% in April and May, according to the Yale Budget Lab. Since then, it has dropped to around 19%.\nBut those estimates rely on assumptions about what US firms will continue to import and from where. The actual June data shows that US importers were craftier than expected. \"The composition of imports has shifted compared to 2024, with a higher proportion coming from countries with relatively low tariff rates,\" Capital Economics found.\nThe June data, for instance, shows that fewer imports came from China, which faced a 40% tariff rate. More imports came from Vietnam, Taiwan, and India, which faced lower rates at the time. That pushed the actual tariff rate lower than if import shares by country had stayed the same.\nUS businesses also shifted the kind of stuff they brought into the country. Imports of steel and aluminum \u2014 generally subject to a new 25% tariff \u2014 fell as a portion of all imported products. But there was an increase in electronics exempt from tariffs.\nA third factor keeping the tariff rate fairly low was more \"compliant\" trade with Canada and Mexico than expected. That means there was more trade in goods that meet domestic-content requirements and are therefore exempt from the new Trump tariffs.\nThe June trend probably reflects the delayed onset of tariff inflation, rather than the total avoidance of it. Importers have been ducking and weaving as circumstances allow, but they can't do that forever. They can stock inventories with cheaper low-tariff goods while running down stockpiles of costlier high-tariff goods \u2014 for a while. But at some point, demand will require them to replenish all inventories, regardless of the tariffs.\nPlus, Trump is wise to the transshipment of goods from a high-tariff country to the US via a low-tariff country, and some of his trade rules specifically target that. Imports from Vietnam, for instance, face a 20% tariff, but it's 40% if those products really come from China or some other country and just make a stop in Vietnam on their way to the US.\nEven with lower-than-expected tariff rates \u2014 for now \u2014 tariff inflation is beginning to materialize. Monthly tariff revenue collected by the government has jumped from about $8 billion per month before Trump to about $30 billion now. That tax revenue comes from US businesses that have to pay the tariffs when they take possession of imported goods. It's real money that real Americans are forking over.\nWholesale prices in July jumped by the most in three years, confirming that importers are now paying more for goods. During the second quarter earnings season, dozens of big companies, including Apple (AAPL), Ford (F), General Motors (GM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), and Procter & Gamble (PG), said tariffs are denting profit margins.\nCiti estimates that, for now, companies are absorbing most of the cost of tariffs through lower margins and supply chain workarounds. But the pain will eventually flow through to consumers.\n\"US firms appear to be absorbing 60%-70% of the tariffs,\" Citi researchers said in an August 20 analysis. \"However, we doubt that this will prove sustainable. We expect that firms will increasingly seek to pass the tariffs through to their foreign suppliers and US customers.\"\nTrump's trade deals will eventually yield a much clearer picture. The past several months have been a hodgepodge of on-and-off tariffs that have dramatically distorted trade flows. But a year from now, say, there will likely be across-the-board tariffs on most imports that range from 15% to 40%, plus product-specific tariffs on certain product categories that leave nowhere to hide. If you haven't noticed tariff inflation yet, you will soon.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Bluesky and X: @rickjnewman."

      "text": "This Framework Agreement represents a concrete demonstration of our commitment to fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial trade and investment. This Framework Agreement will put our trade and investment relationship \u2013 one of the largest in the world \u2013 on a solid footing and will reinvigorate our economies\u2019 reindustrialisation. It reflects acknowledgement by the European Union of the concerns of the United States and our joint determination to resolve our trade imbalances and unleash the full potential of our combined economic power. The United States and the European Union intend this Framework Agreement to be a first step in a process that can be further expanded over time to cover additional areas and continue to improve market access and increase their trade and investment relationship.\nThe key terms include:\n- The European Union intends to eliminate tariffs on all US industrial goods and to provide preferential market access for a wide range of US seafood and agricultural goods, including tree nuts, dairy products, fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, processed foods, planting seeds, soybean oil, and pork and bison meat. The European Union will immediately take the necessary steps to extend the Joint Statement of the United States and the European Union on a Tariff Agreement announced on 21 August 2020, with respect to lobster (that expired 31 July 2025), coupled with an expanded product scope to include processed lobster.\n- The United States commits to apply the higher of either the US Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff rate or a tariff rate of 15%, comprised of the MFN tariff and a reciprocal tariff, on originating goods of the European Union. Additionally, effective as of 1 September 2025, the United States commits to apply only the MFN tariff to the following products of the European Union: unavailable natural resources (including cork), all aircraft and aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals and their ingredients and chemical precursors. The United States and the European Union agree to consider other sectors and products that are important for their economies and value chains for inclusion in the list of products for which only the MFN tariffs would apply.\n- The United States intends to promptly ensure that the tariff rate, comprised of the MFN tariff and the tariff imposed pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, applied to originating goods of the European Union subject to Section 232 actions on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber does not exceed 15%. When the European Union formally introduces the necessary legislative proposal to enact the tariff reductions set forth in Section 1 of this Framework Agreement, the United States will reduce tariffs on automobiles and automobile parts originating from the European Union subject to Section 232 tariffs as follows: No Section 232 automobile or automobile parts tariffs will apply to covered European Union goods with an MFN tariff of 15% or higher; and for covered goods with an MFN rate lower than 15%, a combined rate of 15%, comprised of the MFN tariff and Section 232 automobile tariffs, will be applied. These tariff reductions are expected to be effective from the first day of the same month in which the European Union\u2019s legislative proposal is introduced. The United States expects the European Union\u2019s legislative proposals will be consistent with this Framework Agreement and enacted by the necessary legislatures. All modifications to US Section 232 tariffs will be executed in a manner that reinforces and is consistent with US national security interests. With respect to steel, aluminium, and their derivative products, the European Union and the United States intend to consider the possibility to cooperate on ring-fencing their respective domestic markets from overcapacity, while ensuring secure supply chains between each other, including through tariff-rate quota solutions.\n- The United States and the European Union will negotiate rules of origin that ensure that the benefits of the Agreement on Reciprocal Trade accrue predominately to the United States and the European Union.\n- The United States and the European Union commit to cooperate on ensuring secure, reliable, and diversified energy supplies, including by addressing non-tariff barriers that might restrict bilateral energy trade. As part of this effort, the European Union intends to procure US liquified natural gas, oil, and nuclear energy products with an expected offtake valued at $750 billion through 2028. In addition, the European Union intends to purchase at least $40 billion worth of US AI chips for its computing centres. The European Union further plans to work with the United States to adopt and maintain technology security requirements in line with those of the United States. in a concerted effort to avoid technology leakage to destinations of concern. The United States will endeavour to facilitate such exports once such requirements are in place.\n- The United States and the European Union share one of the world\u2019s largest economic relationships, supported by mutual investment stocks exceeding $5 trillion, and intend to promote and facilitate mutual investments on both sides of the Atlantic. In this context, European companies are expected to invest an additional $600 billion across strategic sectors in the United States through 2028. This investment reflects the European Union\u2019s strong commitment to the transatlantic partnership and its recognition of the United States as the most secure and innovative destination for foreign investment.\n- The European Union plans to substantially increase procurement of military and defence equipment from the United States, with the support and facilitation of the US government. This commitment reflects a shared strategic priority to deepen transatlantic defence industrial cooperation, strengthen NATO interoperability, and ensure that European allies are equipped with the most advanced and reliable defence technologies available.\n- The United States and the European Union commit to work together to reduce or eliminate non-tariff barriers. With respect to automobiles, the United States and the European Union intend to accept and provide mutual recognition to each other\u2019s standards. Cooperation on standards plays a crucial role in enhancing the transatlantic marketplace. The European Union and United States commit to enhance opportunities for technical cooperation between EU- and US-domiciled standards development organisations with the objective of identifying and developing standards for the transatlantic marketplace in key sectors of mutual interest. The United States and the European Union commit to facilitate conformity assessments to cover additional industrial sectors.\n- Recognising the importance of continued engagement to resolve longstanding concerns, the European Union and the United States commit to work together to address non-tariff barriers affecting trade in food and agricultural products, including streamlining requirements for sanitary certificates for pork and dairy products.\n- Recognising that production of the relevant commodities within the territory of the United States poses negligible risk to global deforestation, the European Union commits to work to address the concerns of US producers and exporters regarding the EU Deforestation Regulation, with a view to avoiding undue impact on US-EU trade.\n- Taking note of the US concerns related to treatment of US small and medium-sized businesses under the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the European Commission, in addition to the recently agreed increase of the de minimis exception, commits to work to provide additional flexibilities in the CBAM implementation.\n- The European Union commits to undertake efforts to ensure that the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) do not pose undue restrictions on transatlantic trade. In the context of CSDDD, this includes undertaking efforts to reduce administrative burden on businesses, including small- and medium-sized enterprises, and to propose changes to the requirement for a harmonised civil liability regime for due diligence failures and to climate-transition-related obligations. The European Union commits to work to address US concerns regarding the imposition of CSDDD requirements on companies of non-EU countries with relevant high-quality regulations.\n- The European Union reaffirms that US conformity assessment bodies can be designated as Notified Bodies in accordance with the Sectoral Annex for Telecommunications Equipment to the Agreement on Mutual Recognition Between the European Community and the United States (1998) to carry out the tasks in relation to all essential requirements, including cybersecurity, in the Radio Equipment Directive 2014/53/EU.

      "text": "WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union will work to ensure lower U.S. tariffs on its car exports are applied retroactively to August 1, the bloc's trade chief said on Thursday, as the transatlantic partners set out details of a framework trade deal struck in July.\nIn a 3-1/2-page joint statement, the two sides spelled out that 15% U.S. tariffs would apply to most EU imports and listed the commitments made, including the EU's pledge to eliminate tariffs on U.S. industrial goods and to give preferential market access for a wide range of U.S. seafood and agricultural goods.\nWashington will take steps to reduce the current 27.5% U.S. tariffs on cars and car parts, a huge burden for European carmakers, once Brussels introduces the legislation needed to enact promised tariff cuts on U.S. goods, it said.\nThe statement said U.S. tariff relief on autos and auto parts would kick in on the first day of the month in which the EU introduced the legislation.\nEU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said it was the European Commission's \"firm intention\" to make proposals by the end of this month, meaning the U.S. car tariff reduction would apply from August 1.\nA senior Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said European carmakers could see relief from the current U.S. tariffs within \"hopefully weeks.\"\n\"As soon as they're able to introduce that legislation - and I don't mean pass it and fully implement it, but really introduce it - then we will be in a position to provide that relief. And I will say that both sides are very interested in moving quickly,\" they said.\nU.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the deal on July 27 at Trump's luxury golf course in Turnberry, Scotland after months of negotiations.\nThe two leaders met again this week as part of negotiations aimed at ending Russia's war in Ukraine, with both lauding their trade framework deal as an historic accomplishment.\nThe joint statement said the deal could be expanded over time to cover additional areas and further improve market access.\nPOSSIBLE TEMPLATE\nThe joint statement was \"a play to hold each other accountable\" and ensure that both sides carried out the pledges announced last month, the U.S. official said.\nRyan Majerus, a former U.S. Commerce Department official now with the King and Spalding law firm, said the statement \"could serve as a conceptual model for what we will eventually see with Japan and South Korea.\"\nThe two major U.S. trading partners negotiated similar reductions in Trump's automotive tariffs but are also waiting for them to be implemented.\nThe EU and U.S. said they intended to accept and provide mutual recognition to each others' automotive safety and other standards, but industry officials said this language was more vague than initially announced.\nLIMITED EXEMPTIONS\nThe joint statement noted that the U.S. agreed to apply only pre-existing Most Favored Nation tariffs of below 15% from September 1 on EU aircraft and parts, generic pharmaceuticals and ingredients, chemical precursors and unavailable natural resources, including cork.\nThis exemption did not apply to wine or spirits, a key EU demand, but the two sides agreed to consider other sectors and products for inclusions.\n\"So these doors are not closed forever,\" Sefcovic said, while acknowledging that securing an exemption for alcoholic drinks would not be easy.\nSpiritsEUROPE trade group Director General Herve Dumesny urged \"both sides to remain at the negotiating table and deliver a swift, full return to zero-for-zero\" tariffs on spirits.\nPURCHASE, INVESTMENT PLANS\nThe U.S.-EU statement reiterated the EU's intention to procure $750 billion in American liquefied natural gas, oil and nuclear energy products, plus an additional $40 billion worth of U.S.-made artificial intelligence chips.\nIt also repeated the intention for EU companies to invest an additional $600 billion across U.S. strategic sectors through 2028.\nBoth sides committed to address \"unjustified digital trade barriers,\" the statement said, and the EU agreed not to adopt network usage fees.\nThey also agreed to negotiate rules of origin to ensure that the agreement's benefits accrued to both trading partners.\nThe statement also left unchanged the 50% U.S. national security tariff on EU-produced steel, aluminum and goods made with the metals, which were expanded this week to hundreds of additional products.\n\"There will be no exemptions, no exclusions for steel and aluminum tariffs,\" Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters at the White House, due to what he said were past exclusion abuses.\nBut the joint statement left the door open to a future tariff rate quota for the EU as the two sides discuss \"ring-fencing\" their domestic markets from overcapacity, a reference to Chinese production.\nNavarro called the Trump administration's agreement with the EU a \"magnificent achievement\" for both sides of the Atlantic that U.S. courts should not criticize.\nA federal appeals court is expected to rule any day on a legal challenge that could strike down a significant portion of Trump's tariffs, those invoked under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal, David Lawder and Philip Blenkinsop; Additional reporting by Ryan Patrick Jones; Editing by Kate Mayberry and Joe Bavier)"

      "text": "Lisa Ward was startled at the prices on sneakers when she recently went back-to-school shopping for her twin boys.\n\u201cAll of them were at least $10 or $20 more than last year. That pissed me off, but I didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d said Ward, a finance professional who lives outside of Atlanta.\nAfter buying two pairs of sneakers for each of her growing 15-year-old boys, Ward was suddenly out $300.\n\u201cPeople are starting to realize how expensive stuff is. Before, the school would say, \u2018You have the wrong calculator.\u2019 Now, they\u2019re saying, \u2018Bring whatever you\u2019ve got,\u2019\u201d Ward said, referring to math class.\nOnline prices on apparel and accessories like shoes, bags and belts surged 9% year-over-year in July, according to data from marketing platform Klaviyo shared first with CNN.\nKlaviyo, a publicly traded customer relationship management firm that examines billions of dollars of transactions each year, found that average order values have increased on nearly two out of three apparel sites (or 64%) this back-to-school season.\nNot only are prices higher this time, but there are fewer deals. Discounts are four percentage points lower than last year, according to Klaviyo, which lists more than 170,000 brands as clients.\n\u2018Lagging impacts of tariffs\u2019\nJake Cohen, head of industry and insights at Klaviyo, told CNN the higher prices are an obvious consequence of the trade war.\n\u201cTariffs have driven prices up. Brands are trying to create margin. The simplest way to do that is to raise prices,\u201d Cohen said.\nThe Klaviyo executive noted that many articles of clothing and accessories are made outside the United States, leaving them exposed to the Trump administration\u2019s tariff strategy. President Donald Trump has increased tariff rates on imported goods to levels unseen in nearly a century.\n\u201cThe lagging impacts of tariffs are coming in,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cRaising prices is not a strategy brands implement often \u2013 unless they need to.\u201d\nThe Klaviyo findings \u2013 a 9% increase in year-over-year prices on apparel and accessories \u2013 are far higher than the official statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOverall, prices increased by a more modest 2.7% year-over-year in July, according to the Consumer Price Index compiled by the BLS. Apparel prices were little changed overall (-0.2% in July), though some items including boys\u2019 apparel (1.9%) and footwear (0.9%) did go up.\nKlaviyo said that discrepancy could relate to the fact that its data is more heavily weighted towards e-commerce than the BLS, which is more focused on store prices.\nHowever, monthly producer prices surged in July by the most in three years. Prices on apparel wholesaling climbed 5%, while the apparel, jewelry, footwear and accessories retailing category spiked 8%.\nAlberto Cavallo, a professor at Harvard Business School, told CNN that 9% \u201cdoesn\u2019t sound outrageous\u201d based on his research into how tariffs are impacting prices.\nCavallo\u2019s research has found that as of August 8, imported goods cost 5% more and domestic goods cost 3% more than pre-tariff trends predicted.\nPrice hikes for furniture, clothes and appliances\nSome back-to-school items for college students moving into dorms and off-campus apartments are also getting more expensive.\nFurniture is 5% above the pre-tariff trend. And the Harvard researchers found that prices for \u201cother articles of clothing and clothing accessories\u201d have jumped by 10% overall, including 12% for imports.\n\u201cAlthough tariffs are often expected to produce a one-time jump in price levels,\u201d Cavallo said, \u201cour research shows that firms rarely pass through the full cost immediately. Instead, they raise prices gradually, especially when there is uncertainty around how long the tariffs will last or how broad they will be.\u201d\nThose higher prices are forcing some Americans to alter their buying habits.\nAlmost one in three (30%) back-to-school shoppers say they\u2019re changing the way they shop due to inflation, according to a Bankrate survey conducted in June of US adults who had already or who planned to back-to-school shop.\nThat\u2019s down from 41% in 2022 but in line with 32% last year prior to the presidential election.\nWard, the Georgia mother of twin boys, said she has tried to save by opting for used clothes and getting a better sense of what school supplies they already have on hand.\n\u201cI think the higher prices are due to tariffs and just greed, to be honest. This is an opportunity for everyone to jack up their prices,\u201d Ward said. \u201cI just wish the prices would come down and make it easier for parents. You want to do right by the kids, but there\u2019s only so much you can do.\u201d\nIn a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai said real wages have increased, inflation has cooled and prices for everyday essentials like gasoline and eggs have declined since Trump took office.\n\u201cAs the Administration\u2019s pro-growth policies of tariffs, deregulation, and The One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019s tax cuts take effect and trillions in investments continue pouring into our economy, Americans can rest assured that the best is yet to come as we transition to a new golden age of American Greatness,\u201d Desai said.\n61% disapprove of tariff hikes\nTrump\u2019s aggressive trade agenda is unpopular, according to polls.\nA 61% majority of Americans disapprove of the tariff hikes on imports, while 38% approve, according to a Pew Research poll released last week and conducted prior to tariff hikes that kicked in on August 7.\nThat same Pew poll found that more than twice as many Americans say tariffs will have mostly negative effects on the United States in the coming years (55%) than those who see mostly positive effects (26%).\nSam, a Georgia father who didn\u2019t wish to share his last name, said he noticed higher prices \u201cacross the board\u201d when shopping for appliances and other items his kids need to go back to college.\n\u201cPrices have definitely increased. Most people are not prepared because wages aren\u2019t moving up fast enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThe consequences of the election, for many people, are becoming clearer and clearer.\u201d\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com"

      "text": "Chinese refineries have placed new orders for Russian crude that will be shipped from ports that typically supply India, as demand from the South Asian country for Moscow\u2019s crude slips following US President Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nAt least 15 cargoes of Russian oil have been secured by Chinese refineries for October and November delivery, analysts said.\nChina and India emerged as the top buyers of Russian oil following Moscow\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which prompted Western countries to shun its exports.\nTrump in July threatened to impose secondary tariffs on goods from countries importing Russian oil to pressure Moscow to end the war in Ukraine.\nEarlier this month, he announced an additional 25% tariff on Indian exports to the US, on top of another 25% levy, for its Russian oil and gas imports. That led to the country sharply cutting down on its purchases.\nAs of last week, China\u2019s state-owned and large private refiners had purchased around 13 cargoes of western Russian crude for October delivery and at least two cargoes for November, said Muyu Xu, senior crude oil analyst at Kpler, which tracks commodities and shipping data.\nThe 15 cargoes of oil, each typically ranging from 700,000 to 1 million barrels, will be loaded from Russia\u2019s Arctic and Black Sea ports \u2013 supplies that usually go to India instead of China, given its distance, Xu said.\nReuters reported earlier this week that China had secured 15 Russian cargoes for the same period, citing analysts.\nXu said the buying reflected an \u201copportunistic\u201d move, with the price of Russian oil remaining at least $3 per barrel cheaper than Middle Eastern alternatives.\n\u201cAs for whether China will continue buying, I personally believe that right now is still a very good opportunity, because over in India, Trump is still pressing hard on them,\u201d she said.\nOn Friday, following his landmark meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump told Fox News that he was not immediately considering retaliatory tariffs on China over its purchase of Russian oil, but suggested he may do so \u201cin two weeks or three weeks.\u201d\n\u201cTaking advantage of this opportunity while prices are low, I think more refineries will probably consider buying more, within a week or two,\u201d Xu said, referring to Chinese refiners.\nLast year, India imported $53 billion worth of petroleum and crude oils from Russia, according to data aggregated by the United Nations. Before the recent cuts, Russian supplies accounted for 36% of Indian market, making the country its largest source of crude, according to Vortexa, an energy data firm."

Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nTariffs may seem like a topic that only matters to economic policy wonks. But these import taxes affect you more than you think, even if you\u2019re not directly cutting the check.\nSince taking office in his second term, President Trump has imposed steep new tariffs on nearly all products imported into the U.S., ending decades of free trade policy and setting markets on a rocky course throughout 2025. Trump has made exceptions for certain products and set and extended dealmaking deadlines as his administration negotiates trade agreements with other countries.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nTrump says his tariffs will rebalance international trade in favor of U.S. producers and manufacturers.\nWe\u2019ll walk you through how tariffs work and what they mean for you and your wallet.\nWho really pays for tariffs?\nTrump has said that tariffs \u201care paid mostly by China,\u201d rather than by Americans. But that\u2019s not how tariffs work.\nThe company importing the goods \u2014 not the exporting company or country \u2014 directly pays the tariff. The duty is collected when the goods clear customs at the importing country\u2019s port of entry.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a [company] importing a good from another country, you\u2019re effectively buying that good in that country,\u201d said Michael Coon, an associate professor at the University of Tampa who studies international economics. \u201cSo you\u2019re paying whatever price they\u2019re charging in that country. Then it\u2019s your responsibility to get the goods into your country. If you want to get the goods into your country, then you have to pay the import tariffs.\u201d\nRead more: 5 ways to tariff-proof your finances\nSo let\u2019s say the U.S. levied a new tariff on laptops from China, and Amazon imports Chinese laptops. A broker representing Amazon would most likely pay the tax to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Service when the goods enter the country.\nBut businesses almost always pass additional costs on to consumers. That means you, the customer buying the laptop, would typically end up paying the tariff, even if you don't know it. The cost would get passed down to you in the form of a higher price.\nSoon after Trump enacted tariffs on Canadian goods, Canadian energy company Irving Oil sent a letter to its customers in New England that their heating bills would reflect the increased cost.\nMany retailers and trade groups opposed Trump's original tariffs on Chinese goods, saying they\u2019d need to raise prices due to the extra cost. The Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, a trade group that represents the U.S. footwear industry, estimated that an additional 15% tariff on imported shoes from China would increase the price of a $49.99 canvas sneaker to $60.98, while the price of a typical hunting boot would jump from $190 to $231.03.\nTariffs are often levied in hopes that consumers will substitute domestic products for foreign-made goods. However, a country imposing the tariffs may lack the infrastructure, natural resources, or cheap labor to produce comparable goods at the same cost, so buying local is often more expensive.\n\u201cEither we pay the higher price on the Chinese goods with the tariffs, or we pay the higher price to U.S. companies,\u201d Coon said.\nDo tariffs protect jobs?\nThe effect of tariffs on jobs is also hotly debated. Tariffs Trump introduced during his first term on steel and aluminum were politically popular. They prompted a few shuttered steel plants to reopen and were credited with creating several thousand jobs in the metals industry.\nBut the negative effects of tariffs can also spill over to employment. Sectors like agriculture, for example, were hard-hit by tariffs China imposed in response to U.S. tariffs during Trump's first term. For example, soybean exports dropped 63% in the first 10 months of 2018, while exports fell by 20%, according to the Congressional Research Service. The agricultural sector likely experienced some job losses as a result, some economists say. When tariffs are imposed on materials like steel and aluminum, industries that use those materials \u2014 like the manufacturing sector \u2014 face higher costs, which can negatively impact employment.\nThe jobs that are saved from tariffs often come at a high cost. The Peterson Institute for International Economics found that every job in the steel industry saved by the 2018-19 tariffs cost American consumers and businesses $900,000.\nDo tariffs affect inflation?\nTariffs can lead to higher prices, but the effect on inflation tends to be relatively minor.\n\u201cTariffs affect very specific sectors of the economy, and inflation is looking at the economy as a whole,\u201d Coon said. \u201cThe price of a few goods going up is not inflation.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s original tariffs were in effect well before shock waves from the COVID-19 pandemic caused inflation to soar. The Economic Policy Institute estimated in January 2022 \u2014 a time when inflation was still skyrocketing \u2014 that removing the tariffs would have offset no more than 7.2% of the run-up in consumer prices.\nRead more: What is inflation, and how does it affect you?\nWhat Trump is doing and promising in his second term\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump\u2019s platform included a call to \u201cstop outsourcing and turn the United States into a manufacturing superpower,\u201d and provide large tax cuts for American workers. Trump suggested that tax cuts could be funded by a 60% increase in tariffs on Chinese goods and a 10% hike on other trade partners. In a meeting with congressional Republicans, he even reportedly suggested eliminating the income tax and replacing it with higher tariffs.\nOnce in office, Trump moved quickly on tariffs but at more tempered levels. Weeks into his new term, he announced tariffs to take effect beginning Feb. 4 \u2014 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% on imports from China. Duties on oil imports from Canada would be lower at 10%.\nBut hours before the Canada and Mexico tariffs were set to take effect, Trump spoke to leaders of both countries and agreed to a one-month pause in exchange for pledges to enhance security at the southern and northern borders. Trump has cited the inflow of illegal drugs as part of his justification for imposing steep tariffs on longtime allies and trading partners.\nAs the March 4 deadline approached, Trump declared there was \"no room left\" to negotiate. At 12:01 a.m., the additional 10% levy on Chinese goods, as well as the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, went into effect. All three countries quickly responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own.\nBut the biggest bombshell was Trump's April 2 announcement of reciprocal tariffs, which are meant to make up for the tariffs and other barriers that countries impose on U.S. goods.\n\u201cReciprocal, that means they do it to us, we do it to them,\u201d Trump said in his announcement.\nTrump called for a universal 10% tariff on countries around the world, plus reciprocal tariffs of up to nearly 50% on dozens of trading partners. Canada and Mexico, two of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners, were not affected by the new measures. But they remain subject to tariffs of up to 25% with some products exempted. Chinese goods face a 30% levy.\nWhile exempting some products from tariffs, Trump has also singled out others for high duties including copper and pharmaceuticals.\nTrump ultimately imposed a 90-day pause on the sweeping duties to hammer out further deals and calm markets. As that July deadline approached, he pushed it out another month. Only July 8 and 9, he released nearly two dozen letters to trade partners, including a threat of a 50% tariff on Brazil.\nTariff FAQs\nWhat is a simple definition of a tariff?\nA tariff is a tax levied on goods imported from a foreign country that\u2019s often used to protect domestic industries and jobs.\nWhat are the different types of tariffs?\nThere are several different types of tariffs, but the most common are ad valorem and specific tariffs. An ad valorem tariff is a tax that\u2019s levied as a percentage of the imported product\u2019s value. The 25% tariff imposed on steel in 2018, along with many imported Chinese goods, is an example of an ad valorem tariff. A specific tariff is a flat tax charged on each imported good (e.g., $1,000 per vehicle or $50 per mobile device).\nWhy and how are tariffs used?\nHere are a few key reasons countries impose tariffs:\nProtecting local jobs and industries: For developed nations, tariffs \u2014 also known as customs duties or import duties \u2014 tend to be protectionist. That is, they\u2019re intended to give a price advantage to domestic goods, shielding a country\u2019s businesses and workers from cheaper foreign competition. The idea is that if foreign materials and products are more expensive, you\u2019ll buy more domestic goods. For example, Congress passed a sweeping range of tariff hikes, some as high as 60%, after the stock market crash of 1929 under the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act to protect the farming industry.\nRevenue generation: Like any other taxes, tariffs also provide income for the government that levies them. In fact, tariffs were the primary source of revenue for the U.S. government during its early days until the federal income tax was established in the early 20th century. Today, tariffs are a minuscule source of income for many developed countries. Poorer countries often have far higher tariff rates than wealthier countries because their governments depend on them for revenue.\nNational security: A government may implement tariffs to avoid relying too heavily on different countries for goods deemed critical to security, like military supplies. Trump cited national security concerns when he hiked tariffs on steel and aluminum because both are used for weaponry and military equipment. Though Congress is typically tasked with levying tariffs and taxes, the president has the authority to enact them unilaterally in the name of defense.\nInfluence other countries\u2019 practices: The World Trade Organization (WTO) largely supports free trade policies, but it allows countries to enact trade barriers like tariffs in response to human rights concerns.\nTariffs can also be used to discourage certain trade practices like \u201cdumping,\u201d which is when companies export products to another country and sell them at artificially low prices to gain a competitive advantage. Former President Joe Biden, who kept most of Trump's early tariffs in place, accused China of dumping practices when he introduced new tariffs on about $18 billion worth of Chinese goods \u2014 including a 100% increase on electric vehicles (EVs) and a 50% increase on semiconductors. Biden said in an interview with Yahoo Finance in 2024 that China was \u201cnot making any money off them. They\u2019re doing it to put other people out of business.\u201d\nRetaliation: Sometimes, when one country imposes a tariff on another country's goods, the exporting country responds with retaliatory tariffs of its own. The Smoot-Hawley Act sparked a trade war as European nations passed retaliatory tariffs, and historians often blame the Smoot-Hawley tariffs for prolonging the Great Depression.\nMore recently, the U.S. tariffs Trump levied on Chinese goods were met with retaliatory tariffs. In April 2018, the Chinese government introduced tariffs of 15% and 25% on 94 food and agricultural products from the U.S. Meanwhile, China dropped its average tariff rate on imported goods from other countries between early 2018 and 2022. In the current unfolding trade war, Mexico and Canada have both vowed retaliatory tariffs, while China has appealed to the WTO."

The company's shares fell about 4% in afternoon trading after Estee Lauder also forecast annual profit below estimates.\nHigher costs related to the Trump administration's unpredictable trade policies have dampened consumer spending, hurting businesses, especially higher-end brands like Estee Lauder and Tapestry as the luxury sector struggles with sagging demand.\n\"This highlights broader pressures on the beauty industry since even those companies that don't rely on imports of finished goods still have to source the bulk of their ingredients, packaging, and other materials from overseas suppliers,\" said Sky Canaves, analyst with eMarketer.\nTo reduce the impact of US-China tit-for-tat tariffs on its margins, the company said in May it would sell fewer cosmetics in China that were sourced from its U.S. factories. For China sales, Estee would rely more on cosmetics made in its factories in Japan and Europe.\nThe company sources roughly 25% of its products sold in China and the EMEA regions from U.S. manufacturing plants.\nEstee Lauder's organic net sales for the fourth quarter fell 13%, after rising 8% a year ago, hurt by softness in the skincare and makeup segments. Estee is also grappling with weakness in the U.S. and China markets as well as in the large European markets of France and Germany.\nTravel retail sales continue to be muted, accounting for two-thirds of the 8% sales decline in the fourth quarter, though plans are in place to expand the company's duty-free presence in the Americas, according to chief financial officer Akhil Shrivastava.\nTo boost earnings, Estee Lauder has also accelerated new launches in categories including skincare, introduced new luxury price tiers, increased investment, and cut costs under new CEO Stephane de La Faverie, who took up the role earlier this year.\nThe company reported a wider quarterly loss of $546 million, up from $284 million a year ago, partly due to impairment charges tied to brand performance at Too Faced and skincare brand Dr.Jart+.\nOn an adjusted basis, it earned 9 cents per share, in line with estimates.\nIt sees full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.90 to $2.10, compared with analysts' estimates of $2.21, according to data compiled by LSEG."

Meanwhile, auto exports climbed 22% during the same period.\nStill, exports face risks ahead. The front-loading impact is expected to fade now that a trade deal has been reached, and Trump has threatened to impose new tariffs on semiconductors this month.\nAuto exports also face uncertainty, as the 25% US tariff on Korean cars remains in place until Trump signs an executive order to align it with the 15% universal rate.

That's above the 2.4% consensus and a rebound from the 0.5% decline in the fourth quarter. Our forecast was for an increase of 1.8%. Imports decreased 30.3% as trade normalized after the first quarter's 51.6% jump in goods purchases (in advance of the expected imposition of tariffs). Net exports of goods and services, aka the trade balance, raised 2Q GDP by 4.99 percentage points, reversing a 4.61-point drag in 1Q. Companies appear to be using the stockpiles built in 1Q. Inventories cut 3.17 points from GDP after adding 2.59 points in 1Q. Spending by consumers rose 1.4%, an improvement from the 0.5% increase in 1Q. Private investment declined 15.6%, led by a 10.3% decline in nonresidential structures. Consumer spending on goods rose 2.2%. Within goods, durables were up 3.7%, after a 3.7% decline in 1Q. Nondurables were up 1.3%. The huge services category was up 1.1% after an increase of just 0.6% in 1Q. That is a little softer than we would like. This steady category added 0.53 points of growth. Government consumption and investment rose 0.4%. The federal government was down 3.7%, with national defense up 2.2%. Nondefense was down a big 11.3%, State and local government was up 3.0%. Growth in real final sales to private domestic purchasers, which exclude net exports, inventory investment, and government spending, rose 1.2 % -- slower than 1.9% in 1Q. The GDP report also contains data on inflation, which slowed in 2Q. The PCE Price Index increased 2.1% in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 3.7 in the first quarter. Excluding food and energy, the index increased 2.5%, compared with an increase of 3.5% in the previous quarter. After the report, futures on the S&P 500 were little changed.

Rival Xbox also hiked sticker prices of its consoles and accessories in the U.S., Europe, Australia and the UK a month later.\nConsoles were expected to be a major driver of videogame market growth this year due to the launch of premium titles such as Take-Two Interactive's \"Grand Theft Auto VI\" and Nintendo's Switch 2.\nBut console price hikes and the delay of highly-anticipated \"GTA VI\" to next year have cast some doubt on the pace of growth in the industry.\nOn Wednesday, Sony said there are no price changes for other markets and prices of PlayStation 5 accessories remain unchanged.\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Leroy Leo)"

      "text": "By Andrea Shalal\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects a big jump in revenues from sweeping tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, and said the money would be used first to start paying down the federal debt, not to give rebate checks to Americans.\nBessent, speaking in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" said he expected to substantially revise upward his earlier estimate of $300 billion in revenues from the tariffs, but declined to be more specific.\nBessent said he had not spoken with Trump about the idea of using funds from the tariffs to create a dividend for Americans, but stressed that both of them were \"laser-focused\" on paying down the debt.\n\"I've been saying that tariff revenue could be $300 billion this year. I'm going to have to revise that up substantially,\" Bessent said. \"We're going to bring down the deficit to GDP. We'll start paying down the debt, and then at that point that can be used as an offset to the American people.\"\nThe U.S. economy could return to the \"good, low-inflationary growth\" of the 1990s, Bessent said, but he blamed higher interest rates for problems plaguing some pockets of the economy, singling out housing and lower-income households with high credit card debt.\nA cut in the Federal Reserve's key interest rate - which Trump has continually pressed for - could help facilitate a boom or pickup in home building, which would help keep prices down in one to two years, he said.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau on Tuesday reported a small increase in groundbreaking for single-family homes and permits for future construction in July, even as high mortgage rates and economic uncertainty continued to hamper home purchases.\nTrump's wide-ranging import tariffs have kept the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates this year, with most central bank policymakers wary of easing borrowing costs until they have more confidence the levies will not rekindle inflation, which has yet to return to the Fed's 2% target.\nRecent indications of softening in the job market, however, have largely convinced investors that the Fed will cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point when it meets in mid-September. That expectation has helped bring down mortgage rates in recent weeks.\nBessent has previously said a 50-basis-point cut in rates was warranted.\n(Reporting by Andrea ShalalEditing by Mark Potter and Leslie Adler)"

The downturn, led by cars, auto parts and steel, was the biggest since February 2021. Export volumes rose by 1.2%, suggesting exporters are continuing to absorb US tariff costs by cutting selling prices to preserve market share.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n-\nWhy New York City Has a Fleet of New EVs From a Dead Carmaker\n-\nChicago Schools Seeks $1 Billion of Short-Term Debt as Cash Gone\n-\nTrump Takes Second Swing at Cutting Housing Assistance for Immigrants\n-\nA Photographer\u2019s Pipe Dream: Capturing New York\u2019s Vast Water System\n-\nA London Apartment Tower With Echoes of Victorian Rail and Ancient Rome\nImports decreased 7.5% as inbound shipments of crude oil, coal and liquefied natural gas all shrank by double digits, but the trade balance still flipped to a deficit of \u00a5117.5 billion.\nThe latest slide in exports may strengthen concerns over whether Japan\u2019s economy can continue to expand as US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs weigh on global trade. While the economy has so far managed to eke out growth in the last five quarters despite weakness in domestic consumption, further drops in exports could drag the economy into reverse.\nContinued falls in exports may also encourage Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda to adopt a cautious stance. The ability of the economy to show resilience in the face of the US duties is a factor in the calculus for the BOJ as it considers the best timing for its next interest rate hike. The BOJ is expected to stand pat when it next sets policy on Sept. 19.\n\u201cCar shipments to the US have started to decline in volume, suggesting that the impact of tariffs is finally starting to show,\u201d said Taro Saito, head of economic research at NLI Research Institute. \u201cIn the US, prices of Japanese exports began rising around June or July, so we\u2019re now seeing the effects of Japanese goods gradually losing their price competitiveness.\u201d\nThe report showed that exports to the US dropped by 10.1% last month from a year earlier, with the value of shipments of vehicles and auto parts plunging 28.4% and 17.4%, respectively. In terms of volume, exports of vehicles to the US fell by 3.2%, a clear indication that carmakers are absorbing a portion of the tariffs to support sales."

Argus believes that Min Vol is an all-weather strategy that is timely in any investing climate. Academic literature and, more to the point, returns history, indicate that Min Vol can deliver market-matching returns on an absolute basis and superior returns on a risk-adjusted basis over various time periods.\nArgus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 07/21/2025: Dividend Growers\nDividend income is often overlooked amid gyrations in the stock market. Consider that in 2024, market bulls were boasting about 24%-plus S&P 500 returns. Few were focused on the broad market index's 1.2% dividend yield. But dividends are an important element of return, and 2025 is bearing that out. Through May, the S&P 500 was up a thin 1.1%; without dividends, there was essentially no returns at all. Indeed, dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. Not for nothing, in 2022, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices turned bearish as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates. We saw that pattern in 2018 as well. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main investment categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks. High-yield stocks typically have dividends that pay out in the 5%-8% range. Though the income appears attractive, the share prices of high-yield stocks may be at risk. Indeed, if interest rates drift higher, risk-averse equity investors could be drawn to the relative safety of bonds and may sell their high-yield stocks. In addition, it is worth noting that a yield in the 7%-10% range could signal a company is struggling and the dividend is in jeopardy. Former blue-chip companies such as 3M, General Electric, Boeing, and Kraft Heinz cut their high dividends in the past few years. Lastly, high dividend payouts likely constitute a high percentage of the cash a company earns, leaving little behind for management to deploy into value-enhancing activities. Dividend-growth stocks typically have lower yields, often in the 1.0%-2.5% range. But the lower-yielding dividends are not likely to be a huge component of cash flow, opening up other value-additive options for deploying to cash management teams -- such as share buybacks, M&A, the repayment of debt, or reinvestment in the core business. Further, while the yields are not as high, management teams may be more likely to boost the payouts over time, as earnings grow.

      "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. has instructed component suppliers including Samsung Electronics Co. and Amkor Technology Inc. to stop production related to the H20 AI chip, the Information reported, citing unidentified sources.\nNvidia issued those orders this week after Beijing urged local companies to avoid using the H20, the Information said, referring to a chip designed specifically for the Chinese market. The US company\u2019s shares slid about 1.3% in US pre-market trading.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n-\nWhy New York City Has a Fleet of New EVs From a Dead Carmaker\n-\nNeom\u2019s Desert Ski Resort Strains Saudi Prince\u2019s $1.5 Trillion Plan\n-\nTrump Takes Second Swing at Cutting Housing Assistance for Immigrants\n-\nChicago Schools Seeks $1 Billion of Short-Term Debt as Cash Gone\nA production suspension would raise questions about fundamental demand for the H20, a less-powerful version of Nvidia\u2019s cutting-edge AI accelerators that competes with similarly capable chips from the likes of Huawei Technologies Co. and Cambricon Technologies Corp. The latter company\u2019s shares soared as much as 20% Friday, leading a rally in fellow Chinese chip stocks.\nNvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. both recently secured Washington\u2019s approval to resume lower-end AI chip sales to China, on the controversial and legally questionable condition that they give the US government a 15% cut of the related revenue. But their Chinese customers are under pressure to adopt homegrown chips instead \u2014 part of a broader objective to build a world-class domestic industry and wean the country off US technology.\nIn past weeks, Chinese authorities have sent notices to a range of firms discouraging use of the less-advanced semiconductors, Bloomberg News has reported. That followed warnings about alleged security risks in the H20, after Washington officials said they were considering ways to equip chips with better location-tracking capabilities.\nThe scrutiny coincides with the growing capabilities of homegrown alternatives to Nvidia designed by Huawei and its peers. On Thursday, Chinese AI phenomenon DeepSeek said its latest AI model was customized to work with next-generation Chinese-made AI chips, without elaborating.\nChief Executive Officer Jensen Huang on Friday said he was surprised when Beijing expressed those concerns and was now addressing that in talks with the authorities. But he reiterated that the H20 houses no such security backdoors. Huang, who was in Taiwan to discuss his upcoming Rubin chip with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., said Nvidia\u2019s also in talks with Washington about a potential follow-up to the H20 for China, though that depended on the Trump administration."

      "text": "By Davide Barbuscia\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -S&P Global Ratings' decision to affirm its U.S. credit rating factored in tariff revenues, but questions remain on the economic outcome of U.S. trade policies that could influence the country's rating in the next few years, the primary analyst on the U.S. said.\nS&P on Monday affirmed its \"AA+\" credit rating for the world's number one economy, saying the revenue from President Donald Trump's tariffs had the potential to offset the fiscal hit from his massive tax-cut and spending bill. S&P, which became the first ratings agency to cut the pristine U.S. government rating in 2011, said the outlook on the U.S. rating remains stable.\nLisa Schineller, primary U.S. analyst at S&P Global Ratings, said execution and effects of trade and budget policies will be decisive for future ratings.\n\"The outcomes of how you execute the budgetary legislation, how the tariff revenue comes, their combined impact on growth and investment that leads to either better or worse or similar fiscal out-turns, that's our focus,\" she told Reuters in an interview.\nNonpartisan analysts have said that the bill Trump signed into law last month could add $3.3 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade. Republicans have argued that extending and adding to tax cuts implemented during Trump's first term in 2017 and meant to expire in 2025, will not drive the debt higher.\nSchineller said S&P's forecast horizon when assessing the U.S. creditworthiness was about three, four years.\nWhile she did not expect the tax and spending bill as such to lower the U.S. budget deficit, she said tariff revenues expected over that horizon would offset - to a certain extent - the deficit-widening impact of the budget legislation.\n\"It is a potentially important offset,\" Schineller said.\nThe Budget Lab at Yale, a non-partisan policy research center, estimates the average effective tariff rate has shot up to 18.6% now from 2.4% in early January.\n\"It's that large of a change that we feel that will bring in important revenue,\" said Schineller.\nThe U.S. reported a $21 billion jump in customs duty collections from tariffs in July, but the government budget deficit still grew nearly 20% during that month to $291 billion. The U.S. national debt surged above a record $37 trillion last week.\nRatings agency Moody's in May downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit by one notch, citing rising debt levels and stripping the country of its last triple-A top rating.\nThat followed a 2023 downgrade by rival Fitch, which pointed to expected fiscal deterioration and repeated down-to-the-wire debt ceiling negotiations."

      "text": "New sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs are now in force as the White House implemented a recent executive action that will see importers paying between 10% and 50% in the coming months as they bring in a variety of goods to the US from around the globe.\nTrump took to social media at the overnight deadline to tout, \"IT\u2019S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"\nDozens of countries \u2014 including top trading partners like the European Union, South Korea, and Japan \u2014 now face a key new rate of 15%.\nOthers are facing \"bespoke\" rates. Those at the higher end of the spectrum have found themselves at odds with President Trump.\nThe latest complete tally, according to recent calculations from the Yale Budget Lab, is that the US overall average effective tariff rate will jump to 18.3% as these \"reciprocal\" tariffs take effect.\nRead more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\nIt's yet another uptick from Trump in his trade wars, with plenty more promised in the weeks ahead.\nTrump even suggested late Wednesday afternoon he is looking to impose a tariff of approximately 100% on \"all chips and semiconductors coming into the United States\" but with an escape hatch for companies that offer even \"a commitment to build inside the United States.\"\nTrump's focus on tariffs hasn't slowed even after months of fears that these new duties will spur at least temporary inflation.\nThe many moves have pushed the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady \u2014 much to Trump's unhappiness \u2014 with Chair Jerome Powell recently noting \"higher tariffs have begun to show through more clearly to prices of some goods.\"\nBut rates continue to rise, with countries now facing higher tariffs, including Brazil, which saw 50% duties go into effect Wednesday, and India, which now faces 25% duties but could see rates double in about three weeks' time over its consumption of Russian oil.\nGoods from almost two dozen nations, from Bangladesh to South Africa, now face higher rates, with shippers there now set to pay 20% or higher.\nMeanwhile, a major surprise in recent days has been Switzerland, which now faces 39% duties. That's after a last-minute trip from the Swiss president, which appears not to have borne immediate fruit in getting an exemption for her country.\nCanada, Mexico, and China are not seeing their rates change this week as all three nations already face headline tariffs of 25% or higher \u2014 and all are on different negotiating schedules."

In response, a Chinese official expressed support for India, highlighting growing cooperation between the two nations amid U.S. tariff threats. Meanwhile, the U.S. and EU established a trade framework that includes a 15% tariff on most EU imports, while U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent projected significant tariff revenue, which he indicated would be used to pay down federal debt.",
