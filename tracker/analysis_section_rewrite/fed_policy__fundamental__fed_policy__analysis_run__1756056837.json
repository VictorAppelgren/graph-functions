      "feedback": "This write-up shows solid multi-source texture but falls short of a world-class, multi-year, first-principles framework; to lift it, insert a dedicated regime map anchored in first-pr principles (real policy rate differentials, terms-of-trade, productivity, BoP/net external position, and a formal policy-reaction function as a guide to rate-path, cf. the Jackson Hole signaling framework and hawkish/dovish calculus discussed around Jackson Hole and Fed commentary) and then translate those anchors into regime definitions and transition conditions (e.g., Regime A: inflation trending to target with wage growth stable—policy easing likely; Regime B: sticky inflation with cooling wage growth—slow or no rate cuts; Regime C: policy and capex cycles dominated by chips/AI with onshore supply, where equity Returns shift toward semis/AI infrastructure). Tie each regime to a clear causal chain to market pricing (policy stance drives risk premia, which shifts tech, autos, and consumer cyclicals) and ground it with explicit numeric anchors drawn from the sources: Ford’s 2.5% CAGR 2014–2024 and Q2 margins of 4.3%/ROIC 10.1% plus a 17% YTD rise in 2025; EV losses of $1.3B in Q2; the 10% Intel-stake potential under Chips Act; J&J’s $2B US expansion with 100 jobs; Disney’s ESPN streaming launch at ~$30/mo and 47,000 live events/year; WH Smith’s 40% pre-market drop on a North American accounting error (cite 22PL3Q360, H7Q52FKDH, 37UZC9X8I). Then codify a base-case and tail risks with crisp, source-backed channels: consumer credit dynamics from C3ODMIQKZ (rate ranges, payoff economics, and term-length effects) and the broader consumer/auto cyclicality threaded through Ford; include a concrete watchlist: Jackson Hole communications, upcoming jobs data (as per 37UZC9X8I), EV-capex profitability signals, and semiconductor policy momentum (H7Q52FKDH). Also reconcile conflicts explicitly (e.g., Ford’s cyclicality and narrow margins vs. EV push still posting losses; and the contrast between near-term fragility in WH Smith with medium-term policy-driven growth in semis and AI). Quantify the narrative with ranges where possible (Ford Q2 margin 4.3%, ROIC 10.1%, EV loss $1.3B; Disney price point $30/mo; WH Smith -40%; J&J investment magnitude; personal-loan rate ranges in C3ODMIQKZ) and keep the structure tight: first-principles anchors, regime map, transmission channels, base case, catalysts/invalidation, watchlist, and confidence. Ensure integrated citations after each consequential claim (37UZC9X8I, H7Q52FKDH, 22PL3Q360, C3ODMIQKZ, TN66GHPAT, JNJ/Disney/WH Smith notes in 37UZC9X8I/H7Q52FKDH, and the personal-loan sources in C3ODMIQKZ). This will deliver a coherent, measurable, and source-grounded multi-year view rather than a narrative snapshot.",
