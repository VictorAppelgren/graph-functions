      "summary": "Japan’s 30‑year government bond auction proceeded smoothly with a bid‑to‑cover ratio of 3.31, easing bond‑market anxiety even as yields hit a record. Fed officials, including Governor Waller, signaled support for rate cuts, and FedWatch shows a 96.6% probability of a September cut, keeping U.S. equity futures slightly positive. Asian markets were mixed: China’s CSI 300 fell 2.5% and the SSE STAR 50 slid 5.4% amid regulatory cooling, while India’s BSE Sensex rose 1.1% after tax cuts. Gold prices slipped 0.8% to $3,531.63 per ounce, and the U.S. dollar index eased marginally to 98.23.",
