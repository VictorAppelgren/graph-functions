      "feedback": "The draft moves well in aggregating several disparate themes, but to reach world‑class rigor you should (1) formalize a true 3–6 month scenario map: base case plus 1–2 explicit alts with 4–6 concrete catalysts, timing windows, and clear invalidation criteria; (2) harden the causal chain from policy/ macro dynamics to market outcomes with first‑principles links (inflation/real rates drive financing costs and consumer demand, private‑markets gate liquidity, and AI/health tech reframings alter growth and risk premia) and attach each step to specific, sourceable numbers; (3) close gaps and reconcile conflicts across sources on key numbers (for example, the debt impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill ranges from roughly 2.4 trillion in the Range piece to about 4.4 trillion in Fox/Whatley‑linked material; present both as scenarios with explicit assumptions and cite the exact sources after each figure) (YQOMV2HAJ; EPJYXB7DX; UPV3X2MQ6; ILYC1M41F; V8TEZOR8R; UPV9/FOXBusiness excerpts as needed). (4) quantify private‑market thrusts with defensible, source‑anchored baselines: Pacaso’s 21% US co‑ownership growth pace and 10 new destinations translating to a $1.8T vacation‑home addressable market; Range’s 0% AUM/rapid AI insights with ~$6B AUM; Mogul’s 10–12% cash‑on‑cash and 18.8% implied returns; HeartSciences’ $32B ECG market and FDA pathway; tie these to plausible cash‑flow/IRR expectations under 3–6 month visibility; (5) insert explicit triggers and invalidations for each channel: PACASO/destination rollout cadence; Range user growth milestones and AI engine deployment; Mogul property underwriting/first‑loss protections; HeartSciences FDA/Medicare reimbursement milestones; Medicaid work‑requirement thresholds and expansion timing (OBBBA details in FOXBusiness); (6) embed 6–12 week policy clarity as a watch signal with probabilistic gauges (e.g., likelihood of debt trajectory tightening or relief depends on CBO/Federal actions) and quantify what “policy uncertainty” implies for yields, discount rates, and equity risk premia; (7) tighten the structure and prose so the prose remains tightly causal and forward‑looking rather than cataloging facts; (8) ensure every assertion that relies on a source includes the source ID; (9) surface 4 watch‑list signals (policy clarity, Pacaso rollout progress, Range growth, HeartSciences regulatory milestones) and assign a likelihood and potential market impact; (10) convert the base case into a cash‑flow/valuation lens (discounted cash flow or relative multiple framing for private platforms) rather than a narrative proxy; (11) reduce hedges and generic phrasing by replacing “could” with probabilistic language tied to cited data, and convert broad statements about “inflation‑sensitive households” or “private markets” into itemized sensitivities with source links. Implementing these edits will yield a more cohesive, source‑dense, and testable 3–6 month thesis with a crisp base case, credible alts, clear catalysts/invalidation points, quantified risk, and a rigorous watch‑list aligned to SECTION FOCUS.",
