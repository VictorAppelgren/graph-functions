  "content": "Aston Villa are on the verge of agreeing a loan deal for Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho.\n\nAn agreement club-to-club and with the player is close with only final details to sort.\n\nThe 25-year-old is into the final year of his contract at Old Trafford with the club holding the option of extending by a further 12 months.\n\nThe Athletic reported on Sunday night that Villa were exploring a deal for Sancho \u2014 separate to the Old Trafford club\u2019s interest in goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.\n\nVilla have been restricted by their need to adhere to UEFA financial regulations all summer, so the terms of any potential Sancho move have to favour the West Midlands club, given those constraints.\n\nVilla are also looking for a wide player, following the departure of Leon Bailey on loan to Roma and the end of Marcus Rashford\u2019s temporary switch from United in the second half of last season.\n\nSancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea, where he made 41 appearances. After the London side did not exercise the \u00a325million obligation to buy clause, he became one of five United first-team players left out of their pre-season tour squad.\n\nSancho has made 83 appearances for United since joining from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 but the last of those came in the 2024 Community Shield, after a public falling out with then-head coach Erik ten Hag.",

The 25\u2011year\u2011old, who is in the final year of his contract with an option for a 12\u2011month extension, would join Villa as they seek a wide player after Leon Bailey's loan to Roma and Marcus Rashford's temporary switch.
