      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid start but still feels like a high‑level narrative rather than a rigorous, first‑principles‑driven forecast. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly linking the real‑rate differential (Fed policy + inflation expectations) to the dollar’s risk‑premium channel, and quantify each leg: e.g., current real‑rate spread ≈ +0.5 pp (Fed 5.25 % vs euro 4.75 % + 0.5 % inflation differential) and the 15 % EU tariff shock’s effect on the euro‑dollar spread (≈ +0.1 pp). Replace vague “risk‑averse investors” with concrete risk‑premium metrics (e.g., VIX‑USD correlation, Treasury yield curve steepening). Anchor the Jackson Hole signal with the 79 % cut probability and the implied September rate cut (≈ 25 bp) from the Fed’s policy‑reaction function (Taylor rule). For the Trump‑Putin summit, model two discrete outcomes: (i) a ceasefire that raises safe‑haven demand → +0.3 pp USD; (ii) a failed deal that spikes geopolitical risk → –0.4 pp USD, citing the Washington Times article (G47IHVUJK) for the 25 % failure probability. Include the RBA cut (quarter‑point) and its relative‑strength spillover (USD‑AUD ≈ +0.2 pp). Use the U.S. CPI data (C7JTB89G1) to calibrate the Fed’s reaction: a CPI below 2 % → +0.2 pp USD; above 2.5 % → –0.2 pp USD. Add a simple Monte‑Carlo table (or a 3‑scenario matrix) to show the dollar index range (≈ 97.5–99.0) over 3–6 months. Cite each source by ID (IBGK2IRII, G47IHVUJK, C7JTB89G1) and avoid generic statements like “risk‑averse investors.” Finally, structure the write‑up into: 1) invariant anchors (real‑rate diff, tariff shock, BoP), 2) short‑term catalysts (Fed signals, CPI, geopolitical shock), 3) base‑case projection with quantified ranges, 4) key risks and watch signals, 5) confidence rating. This will elevate the piece to a world‑class, data‑driven currency analysis.",
