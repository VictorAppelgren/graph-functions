  "content": "ALLENTOWN - PPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL) announced Friday that its board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.2725 per share on its common stock. The utility giant, currently trading near its 52-week high at $36.72, has maintained an impressive track record of 55 consecutive years of dividend payments, according to InvestingPro data.\n\nThe dividend will be payable on October 1, 2025, to shareholders of record as of September 10, 2025, according to a press release statement from the company. The current dividend yield stands at 2.97%, reflecting the company\u2019s commitment to shareholder returns.\n\nPPL Corporation, headquartered in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is a utility company that provides electricity and natural gas services to more than 3.6 million customers in the United States.\n\nThe company maintains its regular quarterly dividend payment schedule, which provides income to its shareholders. This declaration represents a continuation of PPL\u2019s established dividend policy.\n\nPPL Corporation operates regulated utilities focused on electricity and natural gas distribution services across its service territories.\n\nIn other recent news, PPL Corporation disclosed its financial results for the second quarter of 2025. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.32, which did not meet the analyst forecast of $0.38, resulting in a 15.79% negative surprise. However, PPL Corporation exceeded revenue expectations, reporting $2.03 billion compared to the anticipated $1.99 billion, marking a 2.01% positive surprise. Additionally, PPL Corporation has entered into forward contracts to sell approximately 27.4 million shares of its common stock, aiming to raise around $984 million. These contracts were executed through an at-the-market equity distribution program, with settlement dates extending to 2026 and 2027. Furthermore, Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company, both subsidiaries of PPL Corporation, issued $700 million each in First Mortgage Bonds. These bonds carry an interest rate of 5.850% and mature in 2055, secured by liens on substantial real and tangible personal property in Kentucky.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
