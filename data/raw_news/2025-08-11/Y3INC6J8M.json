  "description": "Bolivia's governing Movement Toward Socialism party won't have a big-name presidential candidate on the ballot for the first time in two decades.",
  "content": "LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) \u2014 For most of Renan Aliaga\u2019s adult life, a single name dominated the politics of Bolivia: Evo Morales.\n\nMorales, a former union leader for coca farmers, founded the Andean nation\u2019s most successful political party and transformed Bolivia over three consecutive terms marked by political stability and economic growth.\n\nBut when Aliaga goes to the polls on Sunday to vote for Bolivia\u2019s next president, he won\u2019t see Morales\u2019 name on the ballot after electoral authorities excluded him.\n\nIn fact, for the first time in two decades, Aliaga won\u2019t see any big name from the governing Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party that Morales founded \u2014 not even President Luis Arce, Morales\u2019 protege-turned-rival, who withdrew from the race over his failure to halt an economic tailspin.\n\nUnder MAS, Bolivia enjoyed years of a fixed exchange rate, low inflation and subsidized energy. Now, high inflation, a scarcity of imported goods and fuel shortages have beset the country.\n\nThe main options remaining include a conservative businessman and right-wing former president \u2014 both of whom have run and lost three times before \u2014 and a young leftist Senate leader.\n\nUnsatisfied, Aliaga, a 39-year-old bus driver and former MAS voter, says he\u2019ll make a last-minute decision.\n\n\u201cThe right wing had its chance, and it was a disaster,\u201d he said, recalling the hardship of the 1990s, when Bolivia became a poster child for free-market economics and the two right-wing front-runners \u2014 businessman Samuel Doria Medina and ex-President Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga \u2014 built their careers.\n\n\u201cBut the left wing has proven to be the same, or worse,\u201d Aliaga said, referring to how the MAS strategy of nationalizing resources and redistributing tax receipts sputtered out with the end of the commodities boom.\n\nThe main issues in this hotly contested election are Bolivia\u2019s long-standing leftist economic model, its democratic integrity and the livelihoods of millions of people undergoing the country\u2019s worst financial crisis in four decades.\n\n\u201cThis seems the end of the cycle not only for MAS, but for an entire model of government,\u201d Bolivia political analyst Ver\u00f3nica Rocha said.\n\nTensions within MAS can be traced to Morales\u2019 disputed 2019 reelection. Protests erupted and the leftist leader resigned under pressure from the military. He fled into exile and right-wing Senator Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez took office in what many view as a coup.\n\nViolent clashes between protesters and security forces killed at least 37 people.\n\nMorales returned to Bolivia following the 2020 election victory of his former finance minister, Arce.\n\nBut their competing ambitions collided when Morales announced his intention to return to politics. Lawmakers loyal to Morales deprived Arce\u2019s government of its majority. Judges answering to Arce ordered Morales\u2019 arrest over his sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl and barred his 2025 presidential candidacy on account of his past terms.\n\n\u201cMAS torpedoed its own chances of winning this election,\u201d said Gustavo Flores-Mac\u00edas, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University.\n\nA young vice president, Quiroga became interim leader in 2001 when then President Hugo Banzer, Bolivia\u2019s former military dictator, resigned because of terminal cancer with a year left in his term.\n\nEver since, Quiroga has yearned for a term of his own. He ran three times \u2014 twice against Morales in 2005 and 2014. Now 65, he\u2019s hoping the fourth time\u2019s the charm.\n\nDoria Medina, 66, a former minister of planning from 1991-1993 made his fortune in cement and owns Bolivia\u2019s Burger King franchise. Dubbed the \u201ceternal candidate,\u201d he lost to Morales in 2005, 2009 and 2014, as Bolivia\u2019s natural gas windfall, underwritten by public investment and generous subsidies, buoyed the union leader\u2019s popularity.\n\nWhen commodity prices slumped and gas production plummeted, Morales\u2019 \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d went bust.\n\nNow once-routine errands have turned into nightmares as Bolivians wait in fuel lines that wrap around city blocks, run from pharmacy to pharmacy in search of medicines and queue for subsidized bread that has shrunk to almost half its normal size.\n\nThis may give the opposition its first real shot at power in two decades.\n\nYet Bolivians interviewed across the administrative capital of La Paz expressed not only frustration with the MAS party, but also disappointment in the right-wing establishment.\n\n\u201cIf people vote for the right, it\u2019s because they\u2019re resigned to it as the only alternative,\u201d said Bolivian author Quya Reyna. \u201cThese are recycled politicians from the 1990s era of privatization.\u201d\n\nDoria Medina and Quiroga vow to slash fuel subsidies, dismantle inefficient state-owned companies, let foreign investors mine Bolivia\u2019s abundant lithium reserves and reorient the nation\u2019s foreign policy toward the United States after years of its alignment with China and Russia.\n\nGraffiti sprayed across La Paz reads \u201c100 days, dammit\u201d \u2014 Doria Medina\u2019s pledge to fix fuel shortages and stabilize the exchange rate within his first 100 days. Motorists waiting for hours to get gas find themselves facing billboards of Quiroga promising \u201cNo more lines!\u201d\n\nIf no candidate wins a majority of the vote, a runoff between the top two finishers will be held on Oct. 19.\n\nVoter cynicism is widespread, with many Bolivians saying that they have no faith in any of the candidates to improve their lives.\n\nLongtime MAS voters wary of austerity under a right-wing president aren\u2019t sure where to turn.\n\nSome initially pinned their hopes on 36-year-old Senate President Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez, a coca-farming union activist who could have appealed to Indigenous communities looking for the kind of representation they found under Morales.\n\nBut Morales branded Rodr\u00edguez a traitor for advancing his own candidacy. The Senate leader has made few public appearances since.\n\nA rare centrist candidate, lawmaker Rodrigo Paz and his media-savvy running mate, ex-Police Captain Edman Lara, have recently energized young voters with TikTok videos from the campaign trail. With Doria Medina and Quiroga neck and neck, Paz could play kingmaker.\n\nBut their Christian Democratic Party\u2019s blistering attacks on both MAS and the right-wing have left some voters without a clear sense of where they stand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been raised on politicians\u2019 broken promises,\u201d said Irma Mar\u00edn, 38, shouting to be heard over the crowd at a Paz-Lara campaign rally Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m not sure who to trust.\u201d\n\nFacing an arrest warrant, Morales, 66, has been holed up for months in his tropical stronghold of Chapare. His followers staged raucous protests against his removal from the race, blocking key roads and confronting police in clashes in June that killed four officers and four civilians.\n\nMorales is urging voters to register their rage by casting null-and-void ballots.\n\n\u201cNull votes signal that these elections are not legitimate and the next government of Bolivia won\u2019t be legitimate,\u201d said Chris Velasco, an organizer close to Morales. \u201cThat will mean political instability, social instability.\u201d",

  "summary": "Bolivian President Evo Morales, a former union leader for coca farmers, was excluded from the ballot after electoral authorities excluded him from the governing Movement Toward Socialism (MAS), a party that Morales founded. This is the first time in two decades that Aliaga will see no big name from MAS, which he believes to be the best of the left. The main candidates are a conservative businessman and former president, former President Jorge \"Tuto\" Quiroga, and a young leftist Senate leader. The election, which is hotly contested, may end the long-ruling left in Bolivia due to high inflation, imported goods shortages and a financial crisis. Key issues include Bolivia's leftist economic model, its democratic integrity, and the livelihoods of millions of people during the country's worst financial crisis in four decades.",

  "argos_summary": "Bolivia's upcoming presidential election marks a significant shift as former president Evo Morales, a dominant figure in Bolivian politics for two decades, is absent from the ballot due to legal issues. The ruling Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party, founded by Morales, faces criticism for its failure to address the country's economic crisis, leading to a lack of trust among voters. With high inflation and fuel shortages, the election features candidates from both the right and a centrist option, but many Bolivians express cynicism and disappointment in the political landscape, unsure of who can effectively address their needs.",
