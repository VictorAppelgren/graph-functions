  "content": "Following a Type C meeting in July 2025, Invivyd announced alignment with FDA on a rapid pathway to full approval (BLA) of vaccine alternative monoclonal antibody VYD2311 to protect American adults and adolescents from COVID-19, subject to agreement on safety database size for Phase 2/3 clinical trial and pending full protocol review, and announced the company\u2019s objectives for VYD2311 development.\n\nComprehensive dose modeling of VYD2311 serum virus neutralizing antibody (sVNA) titers (submitted to FDA and recently published in medRxiv) indicates possible strong protection from symptomatic COVID-19 achievable via IM dosing on a long interval (months to quarters and beyond).\n\nFollowing a single dose, serum concentrations of VYD2311 remained high at six months with an observed half-life of the IM dose route having the longest duration at 76.0 (CI: 68.5 \u2013 90.7) days.\n\nIn June 2025, Invivyd announced positive full Phase 1/2 clinical data for VYD2311, a next-generation monoclonal antibody (mAb) candidate designed to prevent and treat COVID-19, including an attractive safety profile demonstrated across all dosing cohorts and routes of administration \u2013 intravenous (IV), subcutaneous (SC), and intramuscular (IM); all reported adverse events (AEs) were deemed unrelated or classified as mild to moderate and largely related to injection site and infusion reactions with no serious or severe AEs observed.\n\n\u201cWhile the second quarter PEMGARDA growth was modest, the base business is growing along with our internal commercial capabilities, while we are simultaneously looking toward an improved target product profile with VYD2311 to protect ordinary Americans from symptomatic COVID-19,\u201d said Bill Duke, Chief Financial Officer of Invivyd. \u201cIn addition to further protocol development to advance VYD2311, we look forward to additional upcoming anticipated milestones including identification of a potentially best-in-class RSV candidate in Q3 2025, identification of a preclinical measles candidate by the end of 2025, and advancement of our efforts to support the Long COVID community with the recently formed SPEAR Study Group.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe we are entering a remarkable period of change for the company that points toward an exciting future,\u201d said Marc Elia, Chairman of the Board at Invivyd. \u201cHaving characterized VYD2311 safety and pharmacokinetics in our Phase 1/2 trial, we are fully engaged on designing our clinical and go-to-market strategy for what we believe will be an exciting alternative to COVID-19 vaccination. As PEMGARDA \u00ae (pemivibart) moves into the fall season, we expect to move quickly to cement our position as the leading provider of monoclonal antibody technology for Americans in need of COVID-19 protection. With U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advice in hand, we look forward to the VYD2311 Phase 2/3 clinical trial design and finalization with the FDA, including anticipated alignment on a pivotal study plan for pediatrics, and advancement of other pipeline opportunities that leverage our technology, such as RSV and measles.\u201d\n\u2022 \n\u2022 Company has initiated discovery efforts to assess pipeline expansion beyond SARS-CoV-2, including potential targets such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and measles.\n\u2022 Company anticipates providing an update on identification of an RSV candidate in the third quarter of 2025 and an update on identification of a preclinical measles mAb candidate in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 In July 2025, Invivyd and leading researchers formed SPEAR (Spike Protein Elimination and Recovery) Study Group to assess the effects of mAb therapy for Long COVID and COVID-19 Post-Vaccination Syndrome.\n\u2022 In April 2025, Invivyd entered into a $30 million non-dilutive term loan facility with Silicon Valley Bank, a division of First Citizens Bank, supporting balance sheet optionality and providing potential additional runway for commercial and pipeline execution if certain conditions and milestones are met.\n\u2022 Revenue: Reported Q2 2025 PEMGARDA net product revenue of $11.8 million, as compared to $2.3 million in Q2 2024.\n\u2022 Cash Position: Cash and cash equivalents were $34.9 million as of June 30, 2025.\n\u2022 Research & Development (R&D) Expenses (including In-Process R&D): R&D expenses were $9.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, compared to $30.3 million for the comparable period of 2024. This decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in commercial manufacturing costs of VYD2311, a decrease in clinical trial costs related to our CANOPY Phase 3 clinical trial and a decrease in personnel-related costs.\n\u2022 Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) Expenses: SG&A expenses were $16.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, compared to $21.1 million for the comparable period of 2024. This decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by increased headcount-related costs and professional services fees.\n\u2022 Net Loss and Net Loss per Share: Net loss was $14.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, compared to $47.2 million for the comparable period in 2024. Basic and diluted net loss per share was $0.12 for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, compared to $0.40 for the comparable period in 2024.\n\n\n\nPEMGARDA\u00ae (pemivibart) is a half-life extended investigational monoclonal antibody (mAb). PEMGARDA was engineered from adintrevimab, Invivyd\u2019s investigational mAb that has a robust safety data package and provided evidence of clinical efficacy in global Phase 2/3 clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. PEMGARDA has demonstrated in vitro neutralizing activity against major SARS-CoV-2 variants, including JN.1, KP.3.1.1, XEC and LP.8.1. PEMGARDA targets the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), thereby inhibiting virus attachment to the human ACE2 receptor on host cells.\n\nPEMGARDA (pemivibart) injection (4500 mg), for intravenous use is an investigational mAb that has not been approved, but has been authorized for emergency use by the U.S. FDA under an EUA for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise due to certain medical conditions or receipt of certain immunosuppressive medications or treatments and are unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. Recipients should not be currently infected with or have had a known recent exposure to an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nPEMGARDA is not authorized for use for treatment of COVID-19, treatment of Long COVID, or post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. Pre-exposure prophylaxis with PEMGARDA is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended. Individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended, including individuals with moderate-to-severe immune compromise who may derive benefit from COVID-19 vaccinations, should receive COVID-19 vaccination. In individuals who have recently received a COVID-19 vaccine, PEMGARDA should be administered at least 2 weeks after vaccination.\n\nAnaphylaxis has been observed with PEMGARDA and the PEMGARDA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers includes a boxed warning for anaphylaxis. The most common adverse reactions included systemic infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity reactions, local infusion site reactions, and infusion site infiltration or extravasation. For additional information, please see the PEMGARDA full product Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers, including important safety information and boxed warning.\n\nTo support the EUA for PEMGARDA, an immunobridging approach was used to determine if PEMGARDA may be effective for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19. Immunobridging is based on the serum virus neutralizing titer-efficacy relationships identified with other neutralizing human mAbs against SARS-CoV-2. This includes adintrevimab, the parent mAb of pemivibart, and other mAbs that were previously authorized for EUA. There are limitations of the data supporting the benefits of PEMGARDA. Evidence of clinical efficacy for other neutralizing human mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 was based on different populations and SARS-CoV-2 variants that are no longer circulating. Further, the variability associated with cell-based EC50 value determinations, along with limitations related to pharmacokinetic data and efficacy estimates for the mAbs in prior clinical trials, impact the ability to precisely estimate protective titer ranges. Additionally, certain SARS-CoV-2 viral variants may emerge that have substantially reduced susceptibility to PEMGARDA, and PEMGARDA may not be effective at preventing COVID-19 caused by these SARS-CoV-2 viral variants.\n\nThe emergency use of PEMGARDA is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner. PEMGARDA is authorized for use only when the combined national frequency of variants with substantially reduced susceptibility to PEMGARDA is less than or equal to 90%, based on available information including variant susceptibility to PEMGARDA and national variant frequencies.\n\nThe CANOPY Phase 3 clinical trial was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pemivibart and to assess immunobridging from pemivibart to certain historical data from the company\u2019s previous Phase 2/3 clinical trial of adintrevimab (ADG20) for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 (EVADE). Additionally, there were pre-specified exploratory endpoints through three, six and twelve months to evaluate clinical efficacy of pemivibart compared to placebo in the prevention of RT-PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19. The latest analysis from the Phase 3 CANOPY clinical trial included 365-day data. The CANOPY clinical trial enrolled participants in two cohorts: Cohort A was a single-arm, open-label trial in adults with moderate-to-severe immune compromise including complex underlying medical conditions. Cohort B was a randomized, placebo-controlled cohort that enrolled adults without moderate-to-severe immune compromise at risk of acquiring COVID-19 due to regular unmasked face-to-face interactions in indoor settings.\n\nVYD2311 is a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) candidate being developed for COVID-19 to continue to address the urgent need for new prophylactic and therapeutic options. The pharmacokinetic profile and antiviral potency of VYD2311 may offer the ability to deliver clinically meaningful titer levels through more patient-friendly means such as an intramuscular route of administration.\n\nVYD2311 was engineered using Invivyd\u2019s proprietary integrated technology platform and is the product of serial molecular evolution designed to generate an antibody optimized for neutralizing contemporary virus lineages. VYD2311 leverages the same antibody backbone as pemivibart, Invivyd\u2019s investigational mAb granted emergency use authorization in the U.S. for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of symptomatic COVID-19 in certain immunocompromised patients, and adintrevimab, Invivyd\u2019s investigational mAb that has a robust safety data package and demonstrated clinically meaningful results in global Phase 2/3 clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.\n\nInvivyd, Inc. (Nasdaq: IVVD) is a biopharmaceutical company devoted to delivering protection from serious viral infectious diseases, beginning with SARS-CoV-2. Invivyd deploys a proprietary integrated technology platform unique in the industry designed to assess, monitor, develop, and adapt to create best in class antibodies. In March 2024, Invivyd received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. FDA for a monoclonal antibody (mAb) in its pipeline of innovative antibody candidates.
