      "text": "A father died after drinking a nutrition shake at the hospital. Now his family is suing.\nA California family is suing for wrongful death in the wake of a listeria outbreak caused by nutrition shakes that led to the deaths of 14 people this year.\nIn February, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced an investigation into an outbreak linked to Lyons ReadyCare and Sysco Imperial brand frozen supplemental shakes. At the time, Lyons Magnus LLC, the parent company, recalled 17 affected products. The contaminated shakes, distributed to long-term care facilities and hospitals, were produced by a Prairie Farms Dairy Inc. facility in Fort Wayne, Indiana.\nThe FDA and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) declared the outbreak over on May 16. The agency reported 42 cases of listeriosis, or listeria poisoning, across 21 states, resulting in 41 hospitalizations and 14 deaths.\nThe illnesses and deaths, which overwhelmingly (90%) occurred in people in care facilities or those who had been hospitalized before they became infected, were confirmed through whole genome sequencing as being caused by the outbreak strain associated with the shakes.\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Lyons Magnus and Prairie Farms Dairy for comment.\nWrongful death suit alleges man died of listerosis complications\nThe CDC began monitoring the outbreak on and off as early as 2018, food safety lawyer Bill Marler told USA TODAY. At the beginning, epidemiologists were unable to identify the source of the illnesses.\nNow, with the outbreak technically over, some families are just beginning to find out their loved ones were victims, Marler said.\nMarler, of the Marler Clark law firm, said he filed the first lawsuit related to the outbreak on Thursday, Aug. 7. It alleges that the outbreak spanned multiple years and was likely the result of conditions within one of the manufacturing and packaging facilities. Marler said that the family who sued was not informed until July that their relative's death was caused by the outbreak.\nThe wife and children of John Wills Sr. named Lyons, the distributor of the shakes, and Prairie Farms Dairy Inc., the manufacturer, in the suit. The complaint said that Wills was recovering from a slip-and-fall injury in a local care facility when, on July 20, 2024, he was given a contaminated shake. Wills, who was previously able to move with the assistance of a mobility device, participate in physical therapy and eat meals normally, soon developed a fever, pain and had difficulty speaking, according to the suit.\nAfter multiple hospitalizations and monitoring for infectious disease, Wills died of \"complications related to his Listeria infection and other comorbid conditions\" on Feb. 22, 2025. His relatives are seeking damages and payment of Wills' medical and legal fees.\nMarler criticized the CDC and FDA for their reporting practices, telling USA TODAY and explaining in a blog post that victims like Wills underwent various tests \u2013 including blood and spinal fluid draws \u2013 and investigations that involved family interviews and reviews of purchase histories. However, they were never informed by the agencies about the source of their illness or death.\n\"I spoke with a family today to inform them that their husband/father died after suffering a Listeria infection,\" Marler said in a recent blog post shared with USA TODAY, which he confirmed was referencing Wills. \"Until today, the family did not know the cause of his infection despite (the) fact that it has been known by local, state and federal officials for over a year.\"\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the CDC and FDA for comment.\nWhich states had listeria poisoning cases?\nA total of 21 states had known listeria outbreaks related to this recall: Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and West Virginia.\nThe 14 deaths occurred in nine states: California, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New York, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington.\nWhich Lyons ReadyCare and Sysco Imperial shakes were recalled?\nAll recalled products had \"best buy\" dates between 02/21/25 and 02/21/26, according to Lyons Magnus. All the contaminated products are believed to have been removed from the market, the FDA notice said.\n- ReadyCare Frozen Vanilla Shake\n- ReadyCare Frozen Chocolate Shake\n- ReadyCare Frozen Strawberry Shake\n- ReadyCare Frozen Vanilla Shake NSA\n- ReadyCare Frozen Strawberry Shake NSA\n- ReadyCare Frozen Chocolate Shake Plus\n- ReadyCare Frozen Strawberry Shake Plus\n- ReadyCare Frozen Vanilla Shake Plus\n- ReadyCare Frozen Strawberry Banana Shake NSA\n- ReadyCare Frozen Chocolate Shake NSA\n- Imperial Frozen Vanilla Shake\n- Imperial Frozen Chocolate Shake\n- Imperial Frozen Strawberry Shake\n- Imperial Frozen Vanilla Shake NSA\n- Imperial Frozen Strawberry Shake NSA\n- Imperial Frozen Strawberry Banana Shake NSA\n- Imperial Frozen Chocolate Shake NSA\nWhat is listeriosis or listeria poisoning?\nListeriosis, or listeria poisoning, is a foodborne bacterial infection most commonly caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. It is considered a serious condition and can be dangerous or life-threatening, especially to older adults, people with weak immune systems and pregnant people.\nSigns and symptoms of listeriosis may not appear until weeks after consumption. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell their health care provider about eating the contaminated food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nAccording to the USDA, symptoms include:\n- Fever\n- Muscle aches\n- Headache\n- Stiff neck\n- Confusion\n- Loss of balance\n- Convulsions\n- Diarrhea\n- Other gastrointestinal symptoms\n- Miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery and/or life-threatening infection of newborn infants\n- Death"

Just over two weeks later, plant personnel found eight more vehicles with similar issues.\nTwo months later, in May 2025, someone submitted a warranty claim for a Nautilus vehicle in China, Ford said, and by June 15, seven more warranty claims were filed in China.\nFord\u2019s Critical Concern Review Group in China opened an investigation on June 18, then transferred the investigation to Ford\u2019s team in the U.S. Investigators analyzed the vehicle parts and found that the headlight malfunctions were linked to a burnt device in the headlamps.\nWhat is Ford doing to fix the issue?\nThe fix is free for impacted owners, Ford said in the announcement.\nFor Nautilus and Mach-E vehicle owners, Ford will mail owner notification letters instructing them to take their vehicles to a Ford or Lincoln dealer to have the part replaced.\nFor Mustang vehicles, owners will be notified by mail and told to take their vehicles to a Ford or Lincoln dealer for inspection. If the serial number matches the ones that have been impacted, the part will be replaced.\nFord began notifying dealers on Aug. 11. The company began notifying owners on Aug. 11 and should be done by Aug. 29. Owners should get letters about inspections and replacements between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31.\nCustomers can search for their VIN numbers at www.ford.com/support/recalls-details.\nThe NHTSA recall number is 25V519000.\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.
