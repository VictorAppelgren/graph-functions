  "description": "Score men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing and accessories from top brands like Abercrombie, REI, Lands\u2019 End and more during 2025 Labor Day sales.",
  "content": "Want more deals? Visit CNN Underscored\u2019s Guide to Labor Day for wall-to-wall coverage of the best discounts to be found during the holiday weekend.\n\nLabor Day, a long weekend spent with family and friends soaking up the last few glorious weeks of summer, calls for a new outfit. I did the hard work for you and have put our deals expertise to work scouring the internet for all the best Labor Day deals on clothing. Our team has years of know-how covering deals, and I\u2019m leveraging that to round up the best ways to refresh your wardrobe. With top retailers and brands like Abercrombie, Lands\u2019 End, REI and more joining in, I\u2019m shopping these Labor Day sales before they run out.\n\nTeeing up the holiday weekend, deals on Allbirds are already live, including the Tree lineup in just about any form you can think of. CNN Underscored editors recommend Allbirds sneakers for their top-notch comfort, ideal for those who reach a daily 10,000-step count.\n\nI caught the editor-loved outfitter at a great time. Across men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing, snag up to 50% off across the brand\u2019s online closet. Stock up on work basics like the popular Sloane wide-leg trousers and off-duty denim pieces.\n\nFall-ready fitness apparel is in at Athleta, and it\u2019s marked down by 30%. Mix and match joggers and quarter-zips that feel cozy once the temps start to drop. Or, grab fan-favorite pieces in deep browns, purples and greens that lean into the seasonal color palette.\n\nWhile some retailers are embracing the cooler breezes drifting in, Columbia is doubling down on summer. Its Annual Summer Sale is still going strong with up to 50% new outdoor apparel markdowns. That spans hiking-ready gear and water shorts as well as fleeces for those who are ready to charge ahead into fall.\n\nBringing polished basics and professional staples to the table, J.Crew is also offering up to 50% off late-summer styles. That means everything from pointelle cardigans to Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy-inspired womenswear are reaping the benefits.\n\nFind discounts at every corner of the coastal-inspired retailer, Lands\u2019 End. With code SAVE50, enjoy up to 50% off full-priced styles \u2014 including the latest batch of fall sweaters, fleeces and denim \u2014 and 50% off sale styles.\n\nLeading up to Labor Day, the major department store is stocked with deals on activewear, intimates, pajamas, denim and more. Take an extra 25% off on-sale styles with code FALL, and accessorize accordingly while jewelry is up to 70% off.\n\nWhen in doubt, you can always look to Patagonia\u2019s Web Specials for seasonal deals on jackets, activewear and gear \u2014 the whole lot. Right now, that includes the brand\u2019s popular Baggies and duffels, great for any Euro travels coming up.\n\nREI\u2019s Labor Day sale is officially on. Our go-to retailer for all things outdoors and adventure is dishing out up to 40% off name brands. Think Patagonia puffers, Hoka running shoes, Arc\u2019Teryx rain jackets, Salomon hiking shoes and more, as well as 30% off all REI Co-op base layers.\n\nFrom Converse and Steve Madden to New Balance and Vans, Zappos has all the footwear classics. Plenty of shoe deals are live in the brand\u2019s sale section, including steep deals on clogs from Crocs and running shoes from Brooks.\n\nWhy these Labor Day clothing deals are worth shopping\n\nCNN Underscored will dedicate the next week to unearthing a plethora of Labor Day sales. That, of course, includes the clothing offers we\u2019ve already highlighted, as well as everything else to come before the holiday weekend. With the seasons changing, there\u2019s no denying that demand for warm-weather clothing will rise. I rounded up these picks based on brands that our editors, experts and readers love, surfacing only the best deals at each so you can prepare your wardrobe in kind.\n\nQuite simply, our goal is to save you money. Our deals editor, Jacqueline Saguin, has been vetting products, tracking discounts and reporting on noteworthy sales since 2020, and that kind of experience extends to the rest of our team of deals editors. Being an advocate for buyers to ensure we\u2019re only recommending the best prices on the best products is what we\u2019re all about.",

      "text": "When Allbirds came out with a new and improved Wool Runner 2 last month, an upgrade from the brand\u2019s cult-favorite sneakers of the same name released seven years ago, I was like, \u201cWait, weren\u2019t the original Wool Runners already perfect?\u201d\nForever keeping us on our literal toes, the brand managed to make some ever-necessary upgrades to the sneaker we never realized we needed. Chief among them, a far more comfortable footbed featuring 14% more plant-based foam, an anatomical heel for that perfectly cradled feeling with each step, a concave tongue to support the instep and so much more. We put the new sneakers to the test to determine if they might be a worthy addition to your sneaker wardrobe.\nLike its predecessor, the Wool Runner 2 is a casual yet elevated everyday sneaker made with thermoregulating and ethically sourced merino wool. It\u2019s machine-washable and features a cushioned midsole ideal for long walks, busy days and speeding through the airport to get to your gate on time. Women\u2019s sizing spans 5 to 11.\nThe Wool Runner 2 adheres to the brand\u2019s reduced carbon footprint mission by including shoelaces made with recycled bottles, plant-based foam midsoles and ethical regenerative wool fabric with temperature-regulating and moisture-wicking properties. Men\u2019s sizes range from 8 to 14.\nWhat we liked about them\nThe lightweight feel of the Wool Runner 2 is pure sorcery. I typically expect shoes designed for walking or commuting to look and feel clunky and heavy, but at around 220 grams per shoe (just under half a pound), these feel eerily close to a barefoot shoe without featuring those distracting (and unattractive) toe indentations. This makes them a super-practical travel option for packing in your carry-on or suitcase when you\u2019re worried about surpassing an airline weight limit or breaking your back over a bulky overnight bag. Even with a wider toe box and a slightly chunkier look (which I require for my swollen foot era during pregnancy), these remain so minimalist and lightweight I can wear them for hours on end without feeling like I\u2019m wearing anything at all.\nTheir versatility is unmatched, successfully toeing the line between casual and effortless and sophisticated and elevated. Whether you opt for the dark gray or crisp white colorway, I can see them dressing down a dress or adding structure to a matching sweatsuit. The options are limitless.\nI\u2019m forever in search of that perfect shoe-to-sock ratio, often settling on the sockless look for a cleaner aesthetic. Thanks to their moisture-wicking and temperature-regulating merino wool fabric, I can easily wear them without socks paired with flared ankle jeans or leggings, or wear them with thin on-trend quarter-crew socks and some yoga pants or a skort.\nWhile I wanted to avoid ruining their gorgeous cozy fabric, it was important to see how they fared in less-than-favorable weather conditions. On a walk in light rain and several jaunts through the mud, they kept my feet nice and dry. Cleanup was a breeze, requiring only a damp cloth and some dish soap to revert them back to brand-new conditions. It certainly helped that the heathered colorway I received disguised lots of debris.\nAs a certified personal trainer who strength trains and power walks daily, I need my shoes to feel supportive to, from and during a workout. In a cardio barre session, I found the Wool Runner 2s offered a solid amount of traction that allowed me to feel stabilized in movements like single-leg dead lifts, mountain climbers and side lunges without offering so much foam and cushion it threw me off-balance like a standard running shoe would. The best part? I performed the whole session sockless to really test the merino wool waters, and post-workout, there was not a drop of sweat or hint of smell to report.\nWhat we didn\u2019t like about them\nI\u2019m a bit of a sneakerhead in that I tend to gravitate toward \u201990s-inspired Dad shoes or resurgences of retro collections. Though I have to squint really hard to style these shoes to fit my personal aesthetic, taste is so subjective. I know several friends and family members who would pick these out of a lineup whether they were selecting an office-appropriate footwear option or going out for casual dinner and drinks.\nWhile this is a small quip, the name Wool Runner is quite misleading. As a fashion-first sneaker, these aren\u2019t designed for running since they lack certain elements that make it safer for high impact and high speeds like a thicker foam footbed, a J-frame outsole for quicker foot turnover and improved foot alignment, mesh panels for extra ventilation and even reflective details runners rely on in low-light conditions. For more active pursuits, I\u2019d definitely point anyone toward the brand\u2019s recently released Vista Racer that provides the cushion and bounce many athletes look for in a running shoe.\nHow they compare\nAt $110 for the new rendition versus $98 for the original, the additional $12 investment might be worth every penny. With the Wool Runner 2s, you get an even foamier footbed for all-day wearability, a better fit courtesy of a wider toe box, a concave tongue, added half sizes to accommodate even more foot types and a more durable merino wool material for structure that prevents your toes from getting crushed \u2014 just to name a few. They\u2019re currently available in women\u2019s sizes 5 to 11 and men\u2019s sizes 8 to 14 in five versatile colorways at launch: Dark Grey, Medium Grey, Rich Earth, Hazy Indigo, Natural White with a blue trim and Natural Black with a red trim.\nBottom line\nDespite my very minor issues with the Wool Runner 2 sneakers, they are undoubtedly the perfect shoe for someone who isn\u2019t quite sure what to throw on in the morning before work, to meet a friend, to run errands or to catch a flight. They\u2019re versatile enough to take you from day to night and everything in between while, most importantly, keeping your feet more comfortable than you ever thought possible."
