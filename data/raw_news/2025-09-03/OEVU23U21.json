  "description": "Google avoids breakup in landmark monopoly case, with the court instead imposing limits on exclusive search contracts, data, and app store terms.",
  "content": "Google sidestepped the toughest penalties in a landmark antitrust clash, retaining control of Chrome and Android.\n\nIn a court ruling, Judge Amit P. Mehta barred the search giant from exclusive search deals, ordered limited data sharing with rivals, and restricted its app store tie-ins. The decision comes after the Justice Department\u2019s landmark monopoly case against Google.\n\nJudge Mehta rejected the Justice Department\u2019s call for drastic remedies, declining to force a divestiture or unwind Google\u2019s multibillion-dollar default search arrangement with Apple\u2019s Safari browser.\n\nHe pointed instead to the rise of generative AI, arguing that new technologies are already reshaping competition and cautioning against imposing remedies that could \u201cjolt the system.\u201d\n\nThe court also set a six-year requirement for Google to open parts of its search index to rivals, while leaving its closely guarded advertising data untouched.\n\nGoogle pushed back against the court\u2019s requirements, saying the new limits could do more harm than good. In a statement, Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company\u2019s vice president for regulatory affairs, warned that mandatory data-sharing \u201cwill impact our users and their privacy,\u201d and confirmed the decision is under review.\n\nThe company argued the outcome validated its long-standing position that people already have ample choice in how they search. It pointed to the rise of AI services as proof that competition is thriving, and noted that forcing a breakup of Chrome or Android \u201cwould have harmed consumers and our partners\u201d.\n\nGoogle said it will continue focusing on \u201cbuilding innovative products that people choose and love,\u201d while navigating the restrictions laid down by the court.\n\nWith Google retaining its default spot on Safari, The Wall Street Journal reported that analysts view the ruling as bolstering the alliance and paving the way for deeper cooperation on artificial intelligence across Apple devices.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, DuckDuckGo chief executive Gabriel Weinberg dismissed the requirement for Google to share portions of its search index as \u201ca nothingburger,\u201d saying it would not meaningfully boost rivals\u2019 ability to compete.\n\nThe split reaction rippled into markets, where Alphabet shares rose more than 8% in after-hours trading and Apple climbed about 3%.\n\nGoogle\u2019s case is only part of a broader federal crackdown on Big Tech. Regulators have also gone after Apple, Meta, and Amazon, accusing them of using their dominance to shut out smaller rivals\n\nSearch itself is in flux. Generative AI products from OpenAI and Anthropic are beginning to erode Google\u2019s dominance, offering new ways for people to look up information.\n\nThe fight is far from over. Google is expected to appeal, and the battle could ultimately reach the Supreme Court.\n\nIn Britain, Apple says proposed competition rules mirror EU-style regulation and could jeopardize the safety of its products.",

      "text": "Earlier today a U.S. court overseeing the Department of Justice\u2019s lawsuit over how we distribute Search issued a decision on next steps.\nToday\u2019s decision recognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information. This underlines what we\u2019ve been saying since this case was filed in 2020: Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want. That\u2019s why we disagree so strongly with the Court\u2019s initial decision in August 2024 on liability.\nNow the Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals. We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we\u2019re reviewing the decision closely. The Court did recognize that divesting Chrome and Android would have gone beyond the case\u2019s focus on search distribution, and would have harmed consumers and our partners.\nAs always, we\u2019re continuing to focus on what matters \u2014 building innovative products that people choose and love."

      "text": "Generative AI (genAI) is reshaping how people search for information. Anyone watching their content pageviews decline is currently experiencing the impact of this. But what\u2019s behind the shift? The speed of the change is impressive, considering how deeply ingrained information-seeking habits can be.\nIn a recent qualitative study, we asked people to bring their own research tasks into the virtual lab. We explored how users' information-seeking behaviors are shifting in response to AI-powered search tools and chatbots. While AI offers compelling shortcuts around tedious research tasks, it isn\u2019t close to completely replacing traditional search. But, even when people are using traditional search, the AI-generated overview that now tops almost all search-results pages steals a significant amount of attention and often shortcuts the need to visit the actual pages.\nSearch Habits Are Hard to Break\nInformation-seeking habits are sticky. Once someone finds a reliable way to easily find information they need, that method becomes nearly instinctive.\nThis partly explains Google\u2019s massive share of the search-engine market. Over the years, many participants have told us they\u2019ve never even considered Bing or other alternatives, simply because they\u2019re familiar with Google and know it works well (enough) for them. In our study, multiple participants commented on their tendency to lean on what they\u2019re already comfortable with.\n\u201cI always start with Google. It\u2019s familiar. It\u2019s what\u2019s there. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing for a long time.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s always Google for me. It\u2019s where I always start; my search engine of choice.\u201d\nPeople tend to reach for whatever information-seeking tool is most convenient. One participant reflected that he got into the habit of using Google because it was built into his Chrome browser.\n\u201cAt some point, I used the Google Chrome browser. It has a default setting that redirects me to Google. So, by default, I just start from google.com. I think that's the main reason I\u2019ve stuck with this for a very long time.\u201d\nBeyond the choice of where to search for information, these habits also influence how users search. For example, several participants in our study (and many participants in other studies over the years) told us that they always skip over sponsored results on a search-results page. Some participants thought that they\u2019re \u201csupposed\u201d to search this way (an example of a technology myth). Others were unable to explain why they skip the ads.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why I always skip the first results. Anything that says sponsored\u2026 I just tend to go to one of the top results that isn\u2019t sponsored.\u201d\nThese are information-seeking strategies that people developed over many years. It makes sense that users would fall into these habits over time, because (in most cases) they aren\u2019t thinking much about the systems they\u2019ll use \u2014 they\u2019re focused on finding answers to their questions.\nUsers rely on them because they\u2019ve generally worked well in the past. To change these habits, people need a significant incentive.\nAI Changes Information-Seeking Habits\nGenerative AI\u2019s value in information seeking is powerful enough to change those ingrained habits. Several participants were aware that their own information-seeking behaviors had started to shift since they began experimenting with AI tools.\n\u201cOh, I always start from Google. I never use different search engines, but these days I also incorporate ChatGPT.\u201d\nGenerative AI offers substantial shortcuts around the often tedious and time-consuming work required to research a topic, including:\n- Defining and articulating the information need\n- Overcoming information gaps and keyword-foraging problems\n- Weighing and selecting credible sources\n- Sifting through enormous amounts of information\n- Scanning through long pages of text\n- Comparing contradicting perspectives from different sources\n- Synthesizing and storing information (mentally or in a note)\nEven when participants utilized only a handful of genAI\u2019s possible information-seeking benefits, they valued the assistance immensely.\nAI Overviews: The First Point of Contact for Novice AI Users\nEvery single participant in our study had at least heard of AI and had encountered and used AI overviews on Google\u2019s search-results pages. But a few of our participants had very limited experience with generative AI beyond those instances.\nAI overviews appear at the top of results pages for many queries on web search engines. They\u2019re powered by LLMs and attempt to quickly define keywords or answer questions.\nAI overviews are the modern, upgraded iteration of the featured snippets and answer boxes introduced by Google and its competitors in the 2010s. Even then, many content sites started to notice a dent in their web traffic as people started to find answers without a click. AI overviews are even more likely to satisfy information needs without clicks.\n(This feature presents a serious challenge for all content producers \u2014 NN/G included.)\nA recent quantitative study by Pew Research analyzed this effect \u2014 they found that Google searchers who encountered an AI overview were substantially less likely to click on results links.\nGenAI Quickly Impresses New Users\nBut AI overviews are limited in their usefulness \u2014 they\u2019re better for quick definitions and fast facts (sometimes incorrect facts) than for complex information-seeking needs that involve synthesis. In these situations, AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini, Google AI Mode, Perplexity, etc.) were more useful. But that use case for AI isn\u2019t obvious to everyone.\nOur study included a few participants who experienced AI chat\u2019s info-seeking benefits for the first time during our study sessions. We watched as their information-seeking habits shifted in front of us.\nFor example, one participant had read AI overviews on Google and frequently used ChatGPT to write and edit emails for work but had never considered using it for information seeking until our study.\nWhen shopping for a football (soccer to the Americans) goal for his 11-year-old son, he used Google search to find the dimensions. An AI overview helpfully supplied them.\nThe participant found the AI overview useful, but his utilization of AI ended there. He proceeded with his task the \u201cold-fashioned\u201d way \u2014 manually searching, visiting websites, and scanning web pages. When considering each option, he wanted a recognizable brand and lightweight-yet-durable construction in the correct size and in his price range. He read customer reviews and flipped through product photos. Whenever he found an option he liked, he wrote it down on a physical sticky note. The process took him 10 minutes and would probably have gone on longer if our facilitator hadn\u2019t ended the task early for followup questions.\nFor a later task (diagnosing a plumbing problem in his house), we directed the participant to Gemini. It was his first encounter with Gemini, and his first time using an AI chat for information seeking. He struggled at first to communicate his precise problem but eventually was happy with the guidance it provided.\n\u201cIt feels like it saved me a bit of time. It\u2019s drawn in a lot of data and kind of tailored it to what my specific need is. [...] There\u2019s a lot of information out there. Plumbing is a common problem. So, there\u2019s a lot of information to sift through to get to the very specific problem I have. I think it\u2019s done a good job.\u201d\nHe recognized that he still had to communicate his need and evaluate the information it provided but was still impressed with how much time it saved him. He told us he planned to try Gemini again for more information-seeking tasks and wished he\u2019d used it for his shopping task.\n\u201cI'll definitely use this in [the] future. I realize maybe I should have come to Gemini looking for the goals. In fact, I might do this when I get off the line and see what it says about the best places to buy regulation goals in the UK.\u201d\nThis is representative of a consistent theme we observed during the study: participants (especially those with limited previous experience) were excited when they realized they could use genAI for information seeking and planned to try it out more in the future. One of our least-tech-savvy participants asked the facilitator for help bookmarking Perplexity so she could return to it later.\nAI Doesn\u2019t Eliminate the Need for Search\nWhile generative AI does offer enough value to change user behaviors, it has not replaced traditional search entirely. Traditional search and AI chats were often used in tandem to explore the same topic and were sometimes used to fact-check each other.\nAll our participants engaged in traditional search (using keywords, evaluating results pages, visiting content pages, etc.) multiple times in the study. Nobody relied entirely on genAI\u2019s responses (in chat or in an AI overview) for all their information-seeking needs.\nThis was true even of our participants who were highly skilled and experienced in using AI for info seeking.\nGemini and ChatGPT Have a Competitive Advantage: Familiarity\nThe participants in our study who were already using AI for information seeking reported being most familiar with ChatGPT and Gemini. In the habit-driven market of information seeking, this familiarity is a huge competitive advantage. In this and previous studies on AI usage, some participants were calling ChatGPT simply \u201cChat,\u201d which is reminiscent of how Google became a verb (\u201cto search\u201d was \u201cto google\u201d regardless of the search engine). Linguistic shifts can portend behavioral shifts.\nChatGPT was the first modern LLM chat on the scene. It captured public attention and currently dominates the AI-chat market. But Gemini\u2019s association and integration with traditional Google search gives it a solid chance to catch up.\nOne of the participants who was among the most experienced with AI explained to us why he relied on Gemini, despite having tried out ChatGPT, Grok, and Copilot.\n\u201cWhen people think of AI, the one they talk about most is ChatGPT. [...] I heard about ChatGPT, tried it out, and was impressed. But then I heard about similar platforms from different companies. I already use Google for a lot of things, so I started doing things on Bard. Then that turned into Gemini. Sure, there are other ones, but I just continued to use this one because it\u2019s what I\u2019ve used for a long time.\u201d\nThese early days will be critical in the AI wars. Companies have a lot to gain from becoming users\u2019 habitual go-to for information seeking.\nThe Changing Landscape of Information Seeking\nGenerative AI tools are undeniably useful for information seeking, and even novice users recognize that potential value right away. However, this study reminds us that, while people working in tech may feel that genAI\u2019s uses are obvious, that is not the case for many consumers.\nEven with the significant value offered by genAI, those tools are up against years or even decades of ingrained behavior patterns. The fact that some of our participants had not previously considered using genAI chat for information seeking suggests that widespread adoption will be slower than genAI fans claim. It will take even longer for the average user to utilize AI to its full potential.\nDiscoverability remains a major challenge for genAI design \u2014 not only the discoverability of the tools, but also the discoverability of its possible functions and how to use it.\nNext in This Series\nIn the following articles in this series, we\u2019ll explore themes and open questions raised by this study, including:\n- The very limited AI literacy of consumers (in terms of what AI can do, how it works, and how to use it)\n- When users tend to turn to genAI instead of traditional search, and how they use both in tandem\n- Formation of new mental models and trust issues with AI\n- Usability issues of \u201chybrid\u201d search-with-AI interfaces, like Google\u2019s AI Mode and Perplexity\n- How genAI helps address the problems of knowledge gaps and keyword foraging\nAbout the Study\nWe conducted remote usability testing with 9 participants from North America and the UK. We recruited for an even mix of demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds and previous AI experience levels. None of our participants worked in design or technology.\nOur study was open-ended and exploratory, focusing on how users\u2019 information-seeking behaviors have shifted in response to genAI chats and increased AI integration into global search engines, particularly Google. To encourage natural behavior, we asked participants to save anything they wanted to research using the internet for the session.\nWe were careful not to prime participants. Especially at the beginning of each session, we avoided telling them the study was about AI, asking them about AI at the beginning of the session, or encouraging them to use AI as participants began their research. We encouraged participants to behave however they usually would, use any site or app they liked, and spend as long as they wanted with it.\nParticipants planned travel, looked for restaurants, learned about DIY projects, researched the American Civil War, studied brain microstructures, and more. Some participants had substantial prior experience using genAI tools and chose to use them. Other participants had very limited prior experience with genAI and chose traditional search methods instead. Those participants were eventually directed them to an AI tool so we could gather their first impressions (after documenting that it wasn\u2019t their natural inclination)."
