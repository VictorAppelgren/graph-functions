  "description": "An infectious diseases physician explains why the horrific shooting at the CDC should alarm all Americans.",
  "content": "I\u2019ve walked the halls of both the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Emory University\u2014places filled with some of the most dedicated and brilliant minds in public health and medicine. I trained there, worked there, and counted many of the people inside as friends and colleagues.\n\nOn Friday, those same halls were turned into a crime scene. A shooting targeted institutions whose mission is to prevent illness, save lives, and advance knowledge. It should shake every one of us that such places were attacked at all.\n\nI wish I could say this came out of nowhere, but it didn\u2019t. During the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, I saw the public health response politicized in ways that undermined the very people risking their lives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the politicization of science reached unprecedented levels\u2014permeating the highest echelons of government.\n\nRead More: Here's Everything We Know About the CDC Atlanta Shooting\n\nIn instances such as these, framing a respect or disdain for science as a political view doesn\u2019t just undermine scientists and public health leaders; it sows fear and doubt among people who may not have the background to interpret complex scientific evidence. It handed a megaphone to groups that spread misinformation while actively dismantling decades of global health progress.\n\nThese attacks haven\u2019t been limited to public health guidance. They have extended to tearing down valuable collaborations and institutions\u2014such as, USAID, GAVI, and others\u2014that have spent years building trust, delivering lifesaving interventions, and fostering global cooperation. The erosion of these systems threatens not only our ability to respond to the next crisis but also the fragile relief they offered to already scared health workers who, in the darkest days of COVID-19, continued caring for patients despite immense personal risk.\n\nIt is easy to forget how dark 2020 was\u2014ICUs overflowing, patients dying by the thousands. Vaccines didn\u2019t just offer hope; they saved lives and reduced suffering. They also gave exhausted and frightened health workers some measure of comfort that they had another tool to protect themselves and their patients. But respectful debate has given way to vitriol, amplified by leaders who use division as a political tool. I\u2019ve experienced it firsthand\u2014harassment, threats\u2014simply for doing my job and providing evidence-based scientific information.\n\nThe shooting in Atlanta on Friday, Aug. 8 2025, was more than an act of violence. It was a warning. Violence against public health workers is violence against the systems that protect us. Undermine those systems, and cases of vaccine-preventable diseases will return. As a result, outbreaks will be more likely to quickly spread and we won\u2019t have the tools to effectively mitigate these risks. Silence science, and people will die\u2014not just from bullets, but from the diseases we could have stopped.\n\nRead More: History Warns us About the Dangers of Trump\u2019s Brain Drain\n\nWe cannot look away and we cannot treat this as just another tragedy in the news cycle. We must demand that our leaders protect those who protect us, rebuild trust in science rather than sow the seeds of disbelief, and reject the politics of division. We must safeguard the institutions and partnerships that have been painstakingly built over decades.\n\nIf our elected officials are unwilling or refuse to do this, then it is incumbent on each and every one of us to take action. This means voting for leaders who prioritize evidence-based policies, speaking out when misinformation and disinformation spreads, supporting local and global public health initiatives, and standing with health workers who put themselves at risk to keep us safe. It means refusing to normalize attacks on scientists and science.\n\nBecause if we fail to act now, Friday will not be the last dark day for science\u2014or for America.",

      "text": "When a contagious, deadly pandemic sweeps around the globe, people look to the World Health Organization (WHO) for guidance. It\u2019s not easy to be the person in charge under those circumstances, but as director-general of the WHO, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has led the way.\nTedros, as he likes to be called, is one of the TIME100 honorees for 2020. During a TIME100 Talks interview with Senior Correspondent Alice Park, he discussed the WHO\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic and the dangers of politicizing a virus that knows no boundaries.\nMarch 11, 2020\u2014the day the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic\u2014is seared into many people\u2019s minds. But by then, the WHO had been ringing the alarm for more than a month; on Jan. 30, when most cases were in China, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency. \u201cWe were using language asking the world to wake up in early February,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cFrom the start, we knew it was serious. It was dangerous. It was public enemy number one.\u201d\nThere was so much more to come. Dealing with a brand-new virus meant starting with little knowledge, and the WHO made missteps along the way. It\u2019s been criticized for being late to recommend that the general public wear face coverings, guidance that only came in early June. Previously, it had only advised that health care workers, people with the disease and those taking care of them should wear medical masks. \u201cThere was a shortage of masks that our health workers can use,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cWe were really concerned, so we said priority should be given to health workers, especially with regard to medical masks.\u201d The WHO also faced backlash in June when the COVID-19 lead, Maria Van Kerkhove, said at a press briefing that asymptomatic transmission appears to be \u201cvery rare.\u201d (She later clarified that the actual rates aren\u2019t yet known.)\nBut the WHO predicted early on the dangers of politicizing the virus. \u201cFrom day one we have been saying, please, you need national unity and global solidarity,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cWe called on political parties and others to actually unite on the fight against the pandemic. I know some countries\u201d\u2014including Finland\u2014\u201dhave even formed a committee of the ruling and the opposition party to fight the pandemic together.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an understatement to say that that didn\u2019t happen in the U.S. President Donald Trump blamed the WHO for the spread of the virus, and in April said he would stop U.S. funding for the WHO. On May 29, he terminated the U.S.\u2019s relationship with the WHO. \u201cMy first reaction was, to be honest, I didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cEven now I believe that the U.S. Administration doesn\u2019t have any good reason to withdraw from WHO.\u201d The move was especially surprising to Tedros because he spoke to President Trump in March and said the conversation was \u201cvery good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t agree on everything; it\u2019s normal. He was very cordial.\u201d\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t know the impact of the withdrawal,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see the U.S. membership or the relationship with the U.S. as a financial transaction. It\u2019s not the money which matters. It\u2019s actually the global leadership of the U.S.\u201d\n\u201cWhen the world is not working together and there is a crack, a division between them,\u201d he said, \u201cthe virus gets the advantage.\u201d\nThe next step forward in the global fight against the pandemic will be the development and distribution of vaccines. \u201cThere is a chance to have vaccines by the end of this year or early next year,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cThe basic principle we\u2019re following now, in terms of distribution of the vaccines, is to give vaccines to some people in all countries, not all people in some countries.\u201d For instance, \u201c20-30% of the population could be covered in each and every country,\u201d he said; priority will be given to senior citizens, health care workers and people with underlying health conditions. \u201cThere should be a political commitment, a decision by all leaders, to make vaccines a global public good and use the formula that WHO is proposing.\u201d\nThe pandemic has laid bare how weak the public health systems are in many nations\u2014and not just low- and middle-income countries. This must change, Tedros said. \u201cThe most important thing is treating health as a fundamental human right issue: real commitment, not lip service, to universal health coverage and primary health care as a foundation, and big investment in public health. Simple public health solutions are important, especially to prevent pandemics.\u201d\nMore Must-Reads from TIME\n- Cybersecurity Experts Are Sounding the Alarm on DOGE\n- Meet the 2025 Women of the Year\n- The Harsh Truth About Disability Inclusion\n- Why Do More Young Adults Have Cancer?\n- Colman Domingo Leads With Radical Love\n- How to Get Better at Doing Things Alone\n- Michelle Zauner Stares Down the Darkness\nWrite to Mandy Oaklander at mandy.oaklander@time.com"

      "text": "Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, supplies vaccines to nearly half of the world\u2019s children. For decades, governments, institutions, and private groups around the world have provided the funding it needs to buy, stockpile and distribute vaccines at reduced cost for lower and middle-resource countries.\nBut leaked documents, first reported by the New York Times, reveal that the Trump Administration has created lists of funding projects it plans to stop supporting, including Gavi.\nDr. Sania Nishtar, Gavi's CEO, talked with TIME about what that could mean for the health of the world.\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\nHave you received any formal notice from the U.S. government about cutting funding?\nWe have enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress for the last 24 years, ever since Gavi was created. That includes support during the last Trump Administration. We were gearing up to have a discussion with them on how to operationalize the budget. About 10 days ago, Congress approved the continuity bill, and funding Gavi was part of that bill. My colleagues and I were exploring ways of having a discussion with them on how to operationalize that budget. This list, this news\u2014we are really concerned to hear it.\nIf the U.S. government does stop its funding of Gavi, what will happen?\nThis is about children\u2019s lives. This is about potentially a million children dying if funding is withdrawn. It\u2019s about compromising global health security if the funding is withdrawn.\nThe U.S. underwrites about 13% to 14% of our budget. If that budget is cut, that translates to 75 million children not getting vaccinated. And that, in turn, means more than a million lives will not be saved. That\u2019s just one dimension of the fallout.\nThe other dimension is entirely different, and relates to global security. Gavi vaccines are a pillar in the global health security response. Whenever there is a public health emergency, and whenever there is a question of needing to mobilize vaccines, we maintain stockpiles of vaccines for Ebola, cholera, and meningitis. Going into 2026, we will be maintaining vaccine stockpiles for mpox as well. Whenever there is an outbreak or an emergency, we mobilize the stockpile.\nRead More: Dr. Francis Collins Led the NIH. Now, He Fears for the Future of Science\nThe U.S. does not just bring dollars to the table. They are important technical partners for the entire global health system, and for Gavi. Last year, for example, when the mpox emergency happened, we invoked the emergency response fund. This is a fund created after I joined Gavi\u2014a special $500 million fund whose purpose is to make money available as soon as a health emergency strikes. We set it in place after learnings from COVID-19, because during the pandemic, the money was not available on day one to invest in vaccines.\nLast year, with this fund, within three days of the WHO approving a vaccine for mpox, we were able to ship the vaccines to the African countries who needed them to contain the outbreaks there. That was possible because we worked closely with the U.S. government, which wanted to donate the vaccines from its stockpile. We worked closely to coordinate moving the stockpile. So the U.S. is a very important partner in the response system that the world has established to respond to emerging infections. And we really want the system to work and to [continue to] work closely with them.\nAre you looking at alternative sources of funding?\nWe have 44 sovereign and private entities and foundations. We are reaching out to them, of course, and they are watching. We are widening our donor base. Some countries that were recipients of Gavi assistance are now becoming donors\u2014Indonesia is a case in point. But a 14% contribution in the budget is significant. It is difficult for other donors to bridge that gap.\nPublic health leaders have talked about how the U.S.\u2019 diminished role in global health will open the door for China to become a leader in health. Would China be a possibility for becoming a donor to Gavi?\nWe speak to all countries of the world. Currently, China is not a major contributor to Gavi.\nCould they be?\nPotentially all countries of the world could be donors. We work very apolitically. We are in the business of saving lives. We are in the business of very impartially moving stockpiles to any country of the world when they are needed. We are really looking forward to working with this [U.S.] government and bringing to bear the importance of the need to continue supporting Gavi.\nWhat would you tell the Trump Administration about why it\u2019s so important to continue funding Gavi?\nI might talk to them about three things. Firstly, I would explain to them that this is about saving children\u2019s lives. Vaccination is one of the public-health miracles. It\u2019s one of the most important public-health interventions ever created on this planet. I would explain what the implications of their pullout is\u2014one million children dying in countries of world with whom they plan to have foreign policy relationships, 40 of which are in Africa.\nSecondly, with humility, I would explain to them that a world without Gavi is a more dangerous world. Because we know that infectious diseases know no borders. The capabilities established by Gavi are unique. No other international body can put money on the table on day zero for financing facilities to order vaccines and mobilize stockpiles. If we are taken out of the equation, there is no way to nip Ebola in the bud in Africa, there is no way to stop mpox from getting on a plane and arriving on your shores.\nNumber three perhaps is not well understood. Gavi is not a charity. We are a multilateral organization. We transition toward country sustainability.\nWhen we start supporting countries by introducing vaccines, countries start paying a certain percentage of that vaccine. When a country\u2019s economic situation improves, its share of their copayment increases. Ultimately, they take over the entire payment for vaccines themselves. Gavi supports [such] \u201cexits.\u201d Since our creation, of the 78 countries we originally supported, 19 have exited from our support. Indonesia exited and has now become a donor. India exited, and it\u2019s highly likely they will become a donor in 2026. African countries have exited. We create a path toward sustainability. We create a path toward country transition so a country owns its public health agenda.\nLast year, countries paid just over $200 million in copayments toward vaccines. Going forward in 2026, countries will be paying 50% of their vaccines. We say we want to run ourselves out of business. That model of development is unique to Gavi.\nWe don\u2019t have 200 offices in field. I would explain to them that we are exactly the organization you should be working with to demonstrate to the world how an organization that is results-oriented with low operational costs, with an established path for countries to transition and become self-sustaining, is an example.\nRead More: The Trump Administration Just Gutted U.S. Health Institutions\nThis Administration is questioning across the board why U.S. taxpayers should be supporting programs that primarily benefit other countries, and Gavi might fit into that. How do you respond?\nEven if you take the lives of children out of the equation\u2014which I think is the most heartless thing anyone could say, but still, let\u2019s take that out of the equation\u2014there are two other reasons why it\u2019s important to support Gavi. One is global health security. Taking us out of the equation would water down and compromise the world\u2019s ability to fight disease, and would be tantamount to compromising yourselves.\nSecondly, there is a very important business equation here, because Gavi spent more on vaccines supplied by U.S. companies than any other country in the world. Gavi funded the procurement of $4 billion lifesaving vaccines from U.S. companies from 2012-2023. And that excludes COVID-19 [vaccines]. They actually get back from GAVI more than what they give us. If [the U.S.\u2019] funding decreases, we will buy less vaccines and serve less countries. Their pharma industries also take a hit.\nHow is Gavi trying to avoid such shortfalls in the future and rely less on donors like the U.S.?\nThis is another learning from COVID-19. Last year, we put in place an instrument called the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator. We put in $1.2 billion for financing that is meant to catalyze sustainable commercial vaccine development on the African continent. It\u2019s an important part of the equation for African nations to be truly sovereign when it comes to vaccine manufacturing. If a vaccine manufacturer on the continent gets WHO prequalification or WHO approval for one of its vaccines, we will give them a milestone payment. It\u2019s an incentive for local investors so that they know there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and if they invest, they have the potential for gaining back their money and making profits going forward."

      "text": "July 7, 2015 11:00 AM EDT\nA n advisory panel selected to assess the response of the World Health Organization (WHO) to the Ebola outbreak blamed the agency\u2019s politics and rigid culture for the poor response to the epidemic. The outbreak has infected more than 27,500 people and killed more than 11,200 in West Africa.\nIn a report published Tuesday , the panel blamed the organization as a whole for being late in activating emergency procedures, despite early warnings from other groups like Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. The panel concluded that the agency made noise about the outbreak with little action and poor preparation: \u201cAlthough WHO drew attention to the \u2018unprecedented outbreak\u2019 at a press conference in April 2014, this was not followed by international mobilization and a consistent communication strategy,\u201d the authors write.\nThe panel argues that the culture at the WHO greatly prohibited action, writing:\n\u201cWHO does not have a culture of rapid decision-making and tends to adopt a reactive, rather than a proactive, approach to emergencies. In the early stages of the Ebola crisis, messages were sent by experienced staff at headquarters and the Regional Office for Africa, including after deployments in the field, about the seriousness of the crisis. Either these did not reach senior leaders or senior leaders did not recognize their significance. WHO does not have an organizational culture that supports open and critical dialogue between senior leaders and staff or that permits risk-taking or critical approaches to decision-making. There seems to have been a hope that the crisis could be managed by good diplomacy rather than by scaling up emergency action.\u201d\nThe panel says that a number of factors were responsible for the delay in declaring the outbreak a pubic health emergency of international concern, including a late understanding of the gravity of the situation, denial among country authorities, culture problems within the WHO and a failure of the international community as a whole to take notice.\nThe report suggests instituting a variety of reforms and priorities, including focusing on fast-tracking vaccines and drugs and calling upon WHO member states and partners to immediately contribute $100 million in voluntary contributions for an emergency fund.\nResponse to the report has been mixed. As the Associated Press reports , some members of the public health community involved were disappointed that individuals were not called out by name and that the agency was already focusing on lessons learned, when the outbreak is still ongoing.\nInside the Ebola Crisis: The Images that Moved them Most Pete Muller, Aug. 26, 2014. Sengema, Sierra Leone. \"The rain started shortly after a small team of Red Cross burial workers approached the body. The deceased man, reportedly in his mid-sixties, collapsed and died outside his remote home more than a day before the burial team arrived. Having received instructions from officials that bodies of Ebola victims are extremely contagious, his family members placed a sheet over his body, marked a cordon in the sand, and called the Red Cross. With approximately 20 burial workers serving all of Kailahun district, an area the size of Rhode Island and rife with Ebola, the team had a backlog of cases. His family endured the presence of his body, laying prone and exposed to the elements, for more than 24 hours. As the team removed the sheet, the stench of death filled the air. The white cloth around the man\u2019s head was crimson with blood. As burial workers sprayed him with chlorine, family members erupted with emotion. I was moved imagining how I might respond if I were in the situation. To me, this picture represents the range of Ebola\u2019s emotional impact. In the two women, we see the devastation and loss that the virus causes. In the faces of the men, we see a sense of despondence, disbelief and suspicion that also defines the response. It was a difficult but necessary picture to make.\"Pete Muller\u2014Prime for the Washington Post Kieran Kesner, Aug. 28, 2014. Monrovia, Liberia.\n\"This is a photograph of the first person I saw who had died from the Ebola virus in West Point, Monrovia. After the Liberian government mandated all schools be shut down in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus, the empty rooms of this school were converted into a temporary Ebola holding center. I entered the building alone and photographed the woman from a distance. I began to make my way closer to her, being careful to avoid the puddles of vomit and other pools of still liquid on the cement floor. Standing over her, I noticed the unbroken beads of sweat that remained on her face and realized the woman had only died a few hours before. I took a few steps back as a body removal team entered the room. Up until this point, to me, Ebola deaths seemed like statistics, but suddenly it had become real. I became enveloped in fear: fear of the invisible killer in the room, fear that I might have made a mistake, fear that I wouldn\u2019t know for days whether or not I was sick, and fear that I would infect my family and loved ones. I desperately wanted to leave the room, to leave the country, to be home, but I couldn\u2019t. I continued to photograph. I watched as the men burdened with the task of removing her body, clad all in angel white, lifted the woman from her mattress and placed her in a body bag on the floor. I photographed as they sprayed her one last time with disinfectant and zipped it shut.\"Kieran Kesner\u2014The Wall Street Journal Mohammed Elshamy, Aug. 25, 2014. Lango village, Kenema, Sierra Leone. \"I arrived to Langtown village, Sierra Leone,with a team of volunteers from Kenema governmental hospital. They were there to bury Baindu-Koruma a female victim of the Ebola virus. Everyone was silent. She had been dead for two days, and everyone was terrified of going inside. As the volunteers left with the body, her husband, Idriss Koruma (who can be seen center) and relatives burst into tears. They had only realized then, it seemed, that she was gone.\nThe photo moved me because I felt helpless for the man \u2013 having a loved one laying on a bed but you can't say goodbye, as this is the least a human could do for one last time, but in a situation like this you can't because you'll probably get the virus and die as well.\"Mohammed Elshamy\u2014Anadolu/Getty Images John Moore, Aug. 15, 2014. Monrovia, Liberia. \"I arrived to Liberia the night before I entered the blue room. It was in a primary school, originally funded by USAID money, which had been closed due to the Ebola epidemic. The Liberian Ministry of Health had decided to open an Ebola observation ward there, and it was located in the West Point township of Liberia's capital of Monrovia. People were arriving to the school in ambulances and being brought in one by one. I photographed them as they made their way, weakly, into the dark building, which had neither electricity nor running water. The following day I returned to the school. I went back to the same blue room and, although the children had been moved to the classroom next door, new patients had arrived overnight. Two of them were now dead, lying on the floor, in pools of liquid. A third, a shirtless man named Ibrahim, sat near a column in the center of the room. Health workers asked him to try and move to another room, so they would be separated from the corpses lying nearby. I watched as Ibrahim struggled to rise. He got to his feet and began staggering towards the door. Just before he reached the threshold, he fell straight backwards, his head hitting hard on the concrete floor. His wife, Umu rushed into the room and stood over him, horrified, afraid to touch him, unsure what to do. A blank blackboard hung behind her on the wall.\"John Moore\u2014Getty Images Benedicte Kurzen, September 2014. \"From early morning till late in the afternoon, we followed the Liberian Red Cross. They have a list of people who died and they go to their communities to collect the bodies. Every time the Red Cross workers do the same thing: they wear protective clothing, interview the family, spray the perimeter and the room, and the body. They carefully open the body bag, carry the body outside for pick up \u2014 sprayers and volunteers facing each other \u2014 and later remove their protective clothing as carefully as they can. Their work is measured, slow: any direct contact with the dead person's body can be dangerous. In this photo, it is all about the gesture. In this chlorinated, silent corridor, there is little else that can convey humanity besides this gesture. This is one human helping another.\"Benedicte Kurzen\u2014NOOR Dominique Faget, Aug. 26, 2014. Bandor, near Monrovia, Liberia. \"I went with a team from the Liberian Red Cross to Bandor from Monrovia to pick up five dead people who had been infected with the Ebola virus. After photographing the removal of three bodies, including a young pregnant woman, I followed the team to a small cottage house where we had heard the bodies of a dead couple were. Once there, one of the Red Cross team responsible for the removal of their bodies gestured to me, patting his heart \u2014 indicating that these people were still alive. I then approached and photographed this man lying silently in the doorway of his home. I wondered how many days this poor sick man, like hundreds of others, had been waiting alone?\nDominique Faget\u2014AFP Ahmed Jallanzo, Aug. 20, 2014. Monrovia, Liberia. \"Violence had broken out in the slum township of West Point as the government tried to quarantine tens of thousands of residents in order to stop the spread of the deadly Ebola virus. As I walked through the town to cover the reactions of residents towards security forces, I saw 15-year-old Shakie Kamara bleeding profusely, a pool of blood forming around him, with his right hand placed underneath his broken leg to keep it in balance. He was caught in clashes with police and had been shot. The ambulance service was somewhat slow to respond as he repeatedly cried for help. The tragic irony is that no one dared try to help for fear of contracting the Ebola virus from his blood and bodily fluids, as avoiding contact is one of the measures of preventing the disease from spreading.\nAhmed Jallanzo\u2014EPA Tommy Trenchard, Aug. 20, 2014. Monrovia, Liberia.\n\"What's tragic about the case of 15-year-old Shackie Kamara is how needlessly he died. [He was shot in the legs during clashes with police]. Ebola didn't kill him, but the fear, panic and confusion it creates led to the circumstances in which he died. He is a symbol of what Ebola can do to a country or a community. The quarantine of West Point was heavily criticized and lifted shortly afterwards. It achieved little, and Ebola remains rife throughout the city. It is also telling that he died of a treatable wound. After health staff started getting ill and hospitals became seen as sites of infection, the whole health system collapsed. If you get sick or injured in Monrovia, there is simply nowhere to go.\"\nTommy Trenchard\u2014NPR Glenna Gordon, Sept. 29, 2014. Monrovia, Liberia. \"Ebola is a disease that divides husband and wife, mother and child, doctor and patient. Health care workers in protective gear that look like space suits attend to patients. Men with chlorine spray-cans take away bodies. Families aren't given the chance to say goodbye to their loved ones. Because the virus is transmitted through touch, it overrides the basic human need for contact and connection. In this picture, health care workers hold hands and pray before doing the risky work of entering an Ebola isolation ward. They find a way to connect despite the layers of latex. No one wants to be alone when facing Ebola. I'm not a religious person. At times like this though, there's little to do but hold hands and pray for each other.\"\nGlenna Gordon\u2014The Wall Street Journal Sylvain Cherkaoui, April 19, 2014. Gueckedou, Guinea. \"Doctors Without Borders sent me to Guekedou Forest in Guinea to cover the current Ebola crisis. After receiving an alert a team of doctors went to look for a woman who was exhibiting symptoms of the Ebola virus. When one doctor took her temperature, it was confirmed: she was infected and had to be admitted to the care center. After donning protective gear, I followed her into the field hospital and took this picture when health care workers told Finda that she had Ebola. What I did not know was that she had an extremely high viral concentration. The next morning, members of her family came to visit. Not long after, maybe minutes later, a nurse told me that Finda had died during the night. It happened so fast, I was shocked and deeply moved.\"\nFollowing a call, an MSF team goes to consult Finda Marie Kamano, 33 years, she feels great weakness with vomiting and dysentery.

      "text": "Since President Donald Trump has taken office, elite Americans and academics are leaving the country. A quarter of those who responded to a recent poll said they would like to move outside the country in the next five years. And European countries are welcoming them.\nAccording to data released by the UK Home Office, between March 2024 and March 2025, a record-breaking 6,000 U.S. citizens applied to either become British citizens or to live and work in the country indefinitely. In April, over 300 scientists applied to France\u2019s Safe Place for Science Program, which promises \u201ca safe and stimulating environment for scientists wishing to pursue their research in complete freedom.\u201d\nAmericans are looking to emigrate for the same reasons immigrants have historically chosen to come to the U.S.: political and economic anxiety and instability in their country of origin. The immigration script of the past century has been flipped, and for academics, in particular, the loss of government funding has led them to seek intellectual freedom and the ability to conduct research elsewhere.\nWhile the rationale for emigration is clear, the potential consequences of their departure are not. What happens when a critical mass of middle-class, educated professionals leave the country? The exits of prominent people can have unexpected effects on a given country, embarrassing the regimes they've left, adding human capital to the places where they are welcomed. Additionally, when people emigrate, their absence consolidates power around the regimes they left behind. In other words, politics becomes more reflective of the ideologies and values of those who stay.\nRead More: What's in Canada's Immigration Bill\u2014and Why It's Facing Backlash\nDuring South African apartheid, famous musicians such as singer Miriam Makeba were forced into exile as the only way to speak out safely against injustices. Makeba was very vocal in her criticism of the apartheid government at a time when most Black women were silenced by discriminatory laws, including pass laws that restricted movement, and denied the right to own land and even custody of their children.\nIn 1960, she left South Africa and continued to use her voice\u2014 both as a musician and activist\u2014to speak on the atrocities in her home country. Her 1963 speech at the United Nations called out global silence on apartheid and encouraged world leaders to act by supporting freedom fighters. In response, the apartheid regime revoked her citizenship and passport.\nBecause Makeba was so beloved for her music and admired for courage, she was granted passports from nine different countries, including Belgium, Ghana, Tanzania, Cuba, Algeria, and Guinea. Among her American peers and friends were the likes of Nina Simone, Marlon Brando, Cicely Tyson, Ray Charles, and Louis Armstrong. Makeba was only able to return home in 1990, at the invitation of the recently-released Nelson Mandela, perhaps the most famous prisoner of the apartheid regime.\nLike Makeba, trumpeter Hugh Masekela was also considered persona non grata by the apartheid regime, which viewed artistic expression by Black people as an act of violence. Masekela was forced to leave home after the 1960 Sharpeville massacres that resulted in the deaths of 69 people and deepened political unrest across the country. Makeba and Masekela, briefly married, also collaborated in anti-apartheid music. Their impact on the politics in their homeland, even from abroad, was powerful, despite the regime making it difficult for them to interact with family. Their highly anticipated 1980 joint anti-apartheid concert in Lesotho was cancelled after the apartheid regime in South Africa pressured neighboring Lesotho and Botswana.\nWhile their music played an essential role in agitating for freedom, exiled artists faced numerous professional challenges and lost opportunities. Makeba\u2019s success in exile came at great cost; two of her children died in exile and she was unable to return home to bury them.\nSouth Africa also suffered from the loss of critical voices. Not everyone who went into exile returned home or was able to continue speaking up from abroad. Those who returned sometimes lacked the professional skills needed to build a life for themselves, having spent their prime years fighting for their survival. And in the U.S., they were often similarly restricted, as Jim Crow segregation mirrored many of the injustices that they experienced at home in South Africa.\nAs South Africans were pushed out, apartheid became stronger and more violent to dissenters. Even children who attempted to combat the racist laws were killed or beaten as in the Soweto Youth Uprising of 1976. In the aftermath, songs became inspiration to those in South Africa. In 1977, Makeba and Masekela's joint song \u201cSoweto Blues\u201d was a widely popular protest song about the massacre and a thorn in the side of the regime. Despite being banned in South Africa, collectively their music served as the soundtrack of the anti-apartheid movement.\nWhile pushing out dissenters may allow an oppressive regime to consolidate power or suit a nation\u2019s current political climate, it can have a huge cost\u2014as America learned at the height of the Cold War. Consider the case of brilliant Chinese scientist Qian Xuesen in the 1950s. Qian had studied at MIT and CalTech and became a full professor at both universities. He went on to co-found NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 1939, becoming one of the top rocket science experts working for the U.S. government. The U.S. government did not view his Chinese citizenship as a national security threat, because the U.S. and China were allies during World War II.\nThis relationship changed after the war. In 1945, revolutionary leader Mao Zedong declared China a communist country. Chinese nationals living in the U.S. were suddenly seen as state enemies. A new director at JPL, where Qian was now working, reported his concerns that some of the lab members were likely communists. There was fear and suspicion due to the growing Cold War and the rise of McCarthyism. Although there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Qian, he was put under house arrest for five years until his deportation to China in exchange for the repatriation of American pilots captured in the Korean War, in 1955 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s administration.\nQian\u2019s politically-motivated exile did little to help America\u2019s Cold War, and instead greatly benefitted Communist China. In 1958, he became a member of the Communist Party and revived his career. Prior to his arrival, China did not have a strong rocket science program. Qian became the \"Father of Chinese Aerospace and Rocketry.\" He helped develop the Dongfeng ballistic missile and the Chinese space program. U.S. Secretary of the Navy, Dan A. Kimble called Qian's departure \u201cthe stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a communist than I was, and we forced him to go.\u201d\nRead More: The Brain Drain That Is Killing America's Economy\nIn short, countries push enormous artistic or scientific talent out at their own expense.\nAmerican brain drain will set the U.S. back decades in innovation and technology, and vanquish America's advantage in education and other major fields. American scientists have been ahead of the rest of the world on healthcare and technological advances like AI. Millions of people have long regarded the United States as a beacon of education and intellectual hope. History shows that an exodus of American academics will likely hasten a collapse of American education, not preserve it.\nLeaving can also have negative impacts on the quality of democracy in the United States. Citizen engagement across diverse perspectives and ideological lines can lead to a better and more inclusive society, ultimately leading to a stronger democracy. Consider the beloved Statue of Liberty, a cultural landmark, that immigrants were not only welcome, but made up the working fabric of America. Moreover, the exit of American elites and academics, many of whom are voters, can diminish citizen voice and engagement, leading to the decline in the quality of democracy.\nThe historical lesson is a cautionary tale. As academics consider leaving because the current government's policies do not reflect their ideals, the vacuum created by their absence may be filled by people whose values align more with the government. For instance, in the wake of Qian\u2019s departure, anticommunist sentiment soared and McCarthyist witch hunts spread. And it took three decades before Mabeka could return to her homeland. Should academics choose to return, they might find America more conservative, and perhaps more flagrantly violent than it was when they left.\nIndeed, defending democracy is a game best played on home turf.\nChipo Dendere is a Political Scientist and Assistant Professor of Africana Studies at Wellesley College.\nKellie Carter-Jackson is a Historian and Michael and Denise Kellen '68 Associate Professor of Africana Studies at Wellesley College.\nMade by History takes readers beyond the headlines with articles written and edited by professional historians.

      "text": "If you\u2019re looking for solid information on COVID-19, the Internet is not always your best bet\u2014equal parts encyclopedia and junkyard, solid science on the one hand and rubbish, rumors and fabulism on the other. Distinguishing between the two is not always easy, and with so much of the time we spend online devoted either to sharing links or reading ones that have been shared with us, not only does the junk get believed, it also gets widely disseminated, creating a ripple effect of falsehoods that can misinform people and even endanger lives.\n\u201cAt its worst, misinformation of this sort may cause people to turn to ineffective (and potentially harmful) remedies,\u201d write the authors of a new paper in Psychological Science, \u201cas well as to overreact (hoarding goods) or, more dangerously, to underreact (engaging in risky behavior and inadvertently spreading the virus).\u201d\nIt\u2019s well-nigh impossible to keep the Internet entirely free of such trash, but in theory it ought not be quite as hard to confine it to the fever swamps where it originates and prevent it from spreading. The new study explores not only why people believe Internet falsehoods, but how to help them become more discerning and less reckless about what they share.\nOne of the leading reasons misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic gains traction is that it\u2019s a topic that scares the daylights out of us. The more emotional valence something we read online has, the likelier we are to pass it on\u2014either to share the joy if it\u2019s something good or unburden ourselves if it\u2019s bad.\n\u201cOur research has shown that emotion makes people less discerning,\u201d says David Rand, associate professor at the MIT School of Management and a co-author of the new study. \u201cWhen it comes to COVID-19, people who are closer to the epicenter of the disease are likelier to share information online, whether it\u2019s true or false.\u201d\nThat\u2019s in keeping with earlier research out of MIT, published in 2018 showing that fake news spreads faster on Twitter than does the truth. The reason, the researchers in that study wrote, was that the lies \u201cwere more novel than true news \u2026[eliciting] fear, disgust and surprise in replies,\u201d just the things that provide the zing to sharing in the first place.\nPolitical leanings also influence what\u2019s shared and not shared. A 2019 Science study, from researchers at Northeastern, Harvard, and SUNY-Buffalo, showed that neither the left nor the right has a monopoly on sharing fake news or real news, with both ends more or less equally mixing fact and fiction. Just which fact and just which fiction they chose, however, was typically consistent with just which stories fit more comfortably with their own ideologies.\nTo dig deeper still into the cognitive processes behind sharing decisions, Rand and colleagues developed a two-part study. In the first, they assembled a sample group of 853 adults and first asked them to take a pair of tests. One, known as the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) measures basic reasoning processes, often with questions that are slipperier than they seem. (For example: \u201cIf you are running a race and you pass the person in second place, what place are you in?\u201d The seemingly obvious answer\u2014first place\u2014is wrong. You\u2019ve simply replaced the second-place runner, but the person in first is still ahead of you.)\nThe other test was more straightforward\u2014measuring basic science knowledge with true and false statements such as \u201cAntibiotics kill viruses as well as bacteria\u201d (false); and \u201cLasers work by focusing sound waves\u201d (false again).\nFinally, the entire sample pool was divided in half. Both groups were shown the same series of 30 headlines\u201415 false and 15 true\u2014about COVID-19, but they were instructed to do two different things with them. One group was asked to determine the accuracy or inaccuracy of the headlines. The other group was asked if they would be inclined to share the headlines online.\nThe results were striking. The first group correctly identified the truth or falsehood of about two thirds of the headlines. The second group\u2014freed from having to consider the accuracy of what they were reading\u2014reported that they would share about half of the headlines, equally divided between true ones and false ones. If they were taking the time to evaluate the headlines\u2019 veracity, they would be expected to share at something closer to the rate of the first group\u2014about two thirds true and one third false. \u201cWhen people don\u2019t reflect, they make a rapid choice and they share without thinking. This is true for most of us.\u201d says Gordon Pennycook, assistant professor at the University of Regina School of Business in Saskatchewan, and lead author of the study.\nMost, but not all. The study did find that people who scored higher on the CRT and basic science tests were a little less indiscriminate, tending to do a better job at both distinguishing false stories and at making better sharing decisions.\nThe solution, clearly, is not to force everyone to pass a reasoning test before they\u2019re admitted online. Things are actually a lot easier than that, as the second part of the study showed.\nFor that portion, a different sample group of 856 adults was once again divided in two and once again shown the same set of headlines. This time, however, neither group was asked to determine the accuracy of the headlines; instead, both were asked only if they would share them. But there was still a difference between the two groups: One was first shown one of four non-COVID-9-related headlines and asked to determine whether it was true or false.\nThat priming\u2014asking the participants to engage their critical faculties before beginning the sharing task\u2014seemed to make a dramatic difference: The primed group was three times less likely to share a false headline than the unprimed group.\n\u201cNudges like this help a lot,\u201d Rand says. \u201cIf you get people to stop and think, they do a better job of evaluating what they\u2019re reading.\u201d\nThe researchers believe there are easy, real world applications that platforms like Facebook and Twitter could use to provide people the same kind of occasional cognitive poke they did in their study. \u201cOne idea we like is to crowd-source fact-checking out to users,\u201d Pennycook says. \u201cAsk people if [some] headlines are accurate or not; the platforms themselves could learn a lot from this too.\u201d\nRand cautions against anything that could seem patronizing to readers\u2014leaving them feeling like they\u2019re being quizzed by some social media giant. Instead, he recommends a little bit of humility.\n\u201cYou could stick little pop-ups into newsfeeds that say, \u2018Help us improve our algorithms. Are these stories accurate?\u2019\u201d he recommends.\nIn no event is the Internet going to be scrubbed of all rubbish. For plenty of hucksters, politicos and conspiracy-mongers, the Internet\u2019s hospitality to inaccuracies is a feature, not a bug, and there is little way to purge them entirely. But small interventions can clearly make a difference. And when it comes to information about the pandemic\u2014on which life and death decisions may be made\u2014the stakes for trying could not be higher.\nMore Must-Reads from TIME\n- Cybersecurity Experts Are Sounding the Alarm on DOGE\n- Meet the 2025 Women of the Year\n- The Harsh Truth About Disability Inclusion\n- Why Do More Young Adults Have Cancer?\n- Colman Domingo Leads With Radical Love\n- How to Get Better at Doing Things Alone\n- Michelle Zauner Stares Down the Darkness\nWrite to Jeffrey Kluger at jeffrey.kluger@time.com"

      "text": "President John F. Kennedy said in 1961 that \u201cthere is no escaping\u201d what he described as America\u2019s \u201cmoral obligations as a wise leader and good neighbor in the interdependent community of free nations; our economic obligations as the wealthiest people in a world of largely poor people, as a nation no longer dependent upon the loans from abroad that once helped us develop our own economy; and our political obligations as the single largest counter to the adversaries of freedom.\u201d\nHe was speaking to Congress about foreign aid and later that year would establish through executive order what has since been known as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which helped make the U.S. the world\u2019s largest foreign aid provider.\nFor more than six decades, USAID has helped dozens of low- and middle-income countries, including conflict-stricken ones, to improve access to food, water, health care, and education. It\u2019s helped stop disease outbreaks, revolutionize agricultural practices, and in some cases, promote democracy.\nBut on Tuesday, USAID shutters its doors for good.\nThe agency\u2019s dismantling began just days after President Donald Trump returned to the White House at the start of this year. Tech billionaire and one-time Trump ally Elon Musk, who was spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency, singled out the agency as a locus of \u201ccorruption and waste,\u201d despite the fact that it constituted just about 0.5% of government spending.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who took the reins of the agency in February, said in March that more than four-fifths of USAID programs were cancelled, and the approximately 1,000 that remained would be absorbed by the State Department by July 1, even amid court battles about the constitutionality of USAID\u2019s closure.\nOn the eve of USAID\u2019s final day, former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama gathered with former staffers as well as U2 singer and humanitarian Bono on a video call. Obama described USAID\u2019s gutting as a \u201ctravesty\u201d and a \u201ctragedy,\u201d according to the Associated Press.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve showed the great strength of America through your work,\u201d Bush told the USAID staffers. \u201cIs it in our national interests that 25 million people who would have died now live? I think it is, and so do you.\u201d\nTrump, evidently, does not.\nJust how many lives won\u2019t be saved as a result of the closure of USAID has been the subject of several studies and projections.\nOn Monday, medical research journal The Lancet estimated that USAID prevented the deaths of more than 90 million people between 2001 to 2021. The study, conducted by researchers from Brazil, Mozambique, and Spain, forecasted that the defunding of the agency could lead to some 14 million deaths by 2030, including 4.5 million deaths of children and babies under the age of 5.\nHere are some of the biggest estimated impacts of the U.S. shirking Kennedy\u2019s \u201cobligations.\u201d\nHundreds of thousands of HIV-AIDS deaths\nTo fight against HIV globally, President Bush launched PEPFAR, or the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, in 2003. The program supports some 20.6 million people with HIV worldwide, including 566,000 children, through providing anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to control the infection. The program also provided HIV testing services to 83.8 million people in 2024.\nUSAID was PEPFAR\u2019s main implementing agency, and while the State Department is seeking $2.9 billion in funding to continue HIV-AIDS programs, it\u2019s far lower than the at least $4.7 billion budget PEPFAR had.\nA study published in the Retrovirology journal in March said that the suspension of USAID funding could hamper access to ART and cause a potential resurgence of up to 630,000 HIV-AIDS-related deaths annually, with sub-Saharan Africa most affected.\nMillions of malaria cases\nUSAID has invested $9 billion to help tackle malaria, the mosquito-borne illness that is preventable and curable but causes millions of deaths in Africa every year, since the inception of the President\u2019s Malaria Initiative (PMI) in 2005.\nAn impact tracker by Boston University infectious disease mathematical modeller and health economist Dr. Brooke Nichols and Amsterdam-based product manager Eric Moakley forecast almost 10 million additional cases of malaria globally\u2014of which an estimated 7 million would affect children\u2014in just one year due to USAID funding cuts.\nThe tracker also only considered African countries that were part of PMI and did not include countries in Asia that have also been supported by USAID. \u201cThus we may be underestimating the effect of PMI\u2019s cessation,\u201d it said.\nMillions of Sudanese to lose access to \u2018lifesaving\u2019 health services\nThe war-torn northeast African country of Sudan was among those worst hit by USAID\u2019s suspension. More than half of its 50 million population is in need of humanitarian assistance as residents suffer from famine and disease outbreaks amid ongoing conflict. The World Health Organization estimates that 5 million Sudanese people may lose access to \u201clifesaving\u201d health services as a result of the cuts, according to the Washington Post.\nNaomi Ruth Pendle, a lecturer at the University of Bath in the U.K., wrote for The Conversation in April that the sudden suspension of USAID is \u201cis set to make the famine in Sudan the deadliest for half a century.\u201d"

      "text": "The suspected gunman in the shooting of a police officer at the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta on Friday has been identified as Patrick Joseph White of Kennesaw, Georgia.\nWhite was killed along with Officer David Rose of the DeKalb County Police Department during the shooting near Emory University, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) said on Saturday.\nImages posted online showed windows of CDC buildings that appear to have been hit by gunfire.\nAuthorities have not yet publicly stated the motive in the incident, but law enforcement officials reportedly told the New York Times that White blamed the coronavirus vaccine for his ill health, suggesting the CDC may have been the target.\nAtlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said during a Friday press conference that the suspect was known to have \u201csome interests in certain things\u201d that he could not reiterate with \u201cconfidence until the investigation is fully conducted.\u201d\nRead more: U.S. Surgeon General Declares Firearm Violence a Public Health Crisis\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the shooting.\n\u201cWe know how shaken our public health colleagues feel today. No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others,\u201d Kennedy wrote on X. \u201cWe are actively supporting CDC staff on the ground and across the agency. Public health workers show up every day with purpose \u2014 even in moments of grief and uncertainty.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what to know about the shooting.\nWhat happened?\nThe local 911 center received notice of an active shooter around 4:50 p.m. at a CVS location on Clifton Road, across the street from the CDC and near the Emory University campus, said Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum at a Friday press conference. Officers who arrived on scene found an injured police officer, but could still hear gunfire happening inside the pharmacy.\nPolice then located the injured gunman on the second floor of the building. It is still unclear whether he had been injured by self-inflicted gunshot wounds or the result of a shootout with police. The suspect died at the scene.\nThe CDC campus received multiple rounds of gunshots, impacting four campus buildings in the attack. Photos of the inside of a CDC building shared by CNN show windows partially shattered by bullet holes.\nCDC director Susan Monarez said in a statement to employees on Friday that CDC leaders were \"heartbroken\" by the attack.\n\u201cThe active shooter incident near our campus today has understandably brought fear, anger and worry to all of us,\u201d Monarez said. \u201cI want to express my deep appreciation for your professionalism and resilience during this time.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s shooting marks the second in Atlanta this week after an Army sergeant opened fire at his post. Five of the shooter\u2019s coworkers were injured in the incident.\nWho is Patrick Joseph White, the suspect in the shooting?\nWhite, the identified shooter, lives in a suburb around 30 miles northwest of the scene of the crime.\nAn unidentified official told the Associated Press that the shooter\u2019s father had reported him to authorities as suicidal earlier on Friday, and claimed he was upset because of his dog\u2019s death.\nThe same official reportedly said White was fixated on the COVID-19 vaccine.\nNancy Hoalst, one of White\u2019s neighbors, described the suspect as \u201cunsettled\u201d in an interview with the New York Times and claimed that he would often engage in monologues related to anti-vaccine conspiracy theories on his porch. \u201cHe very deeply believed that vaccines had hurt him,\u201d Hoalst said, \u201cand that they were hurting other people.\u201d Hoalst added that she \u201cnever thought he would take it out on other people.\u201d\nAuthorities indicated that they are still collecting evidence \u201cdue to the complex scene\u201d and are conducting interviews. \u201cThis investigation will take an extended period of time,\u201d the GBI said in a Saturday statement.\nFormer employees blame Kennedy's anti-vaccine rhetoric\nThe shooting has undoubtedly shaken many CDC employees, who expressed anger and outrage at Friday\u2019s events. Some have blamed anti-vaccine rhetoric, and former HHS employees, which includes the CDC, have pointed the finger at Secretary Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic.\nKennedy\u2019s history of anti-vaccine views includes referring to the COVID-19 vaccine as the \u201cdeadliest vaccine ever made\u201d and calling the CDC as a \"cesspool of corruption.\u201d\nThe subject of misinformation around vaccines was reportedly addressed in a call with CDC Director Susan Monarez following the shooting.\n\u201cAre you able to speak to the misinformation, the disinformation that caused this issue? And what your plan forward is to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen again?\u201d one employee asked Monarez in an employee group call that was reviewed by the Times.\nA group of current and former HHS employees have called for the resignation of Secretary Kennedy in light of the shooting.\n\u201cKennedy is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC\u2019s workforce through his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust,\u201d a statement by Fired But Fighting, the coalition of employees, reads. \u201cThe ongoing destruction of our public health infrastructure has destroyed the systems meant to prevent tragedies like this from happening. Cuts to CDC\u2019s injury prevention center, including programs to reduce gun violence and support mental health, have put our country at greater risk.\u201d\nAuthorities have not yet confirmed a motive in the case. Earlier this week, HHS announced the agency would be winding down mRNa vaccine development.\nCDC offices will be closed through Monday. Employees have been asked to work remotely and remove CDC stickers and other decor from their vehicles.\nWho is David Rose?\nAuthorities identified 33-year-old David Rose as the officer who was killed in the shooting. Rose is a former U.S. Marine who served in Afghanistan. He is survived by his pregnant wife and two daughters, according to DeKalb County CEO Lorraine Cochran-Johnson.\n\u201cHe was committed to serving the community. At this time we are asking for the community\u2019s prayers,\u201d said DeKalb County Police Department interim chief Greg Padrick. \u201cIt\u2019s a noble profession we all do. We answer the call to serve our community and he gave his life to a commitment to serve others.\u201d\n\u201cPray for the family, friends, and colleagues of this hero who acted quickly to defend others and made the ultimate sacrifice,\u201d FBI Director Kash Patel said on X following the news of Rose\u2019s passing. \u201cThe FBI will offer them our full support.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "A shooting incident at the CDC in Atlanta on August 8, 2025, resulted in the deaths of Officer David Rose and the suspect, Patrick Joseph White, who reportedly blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for his health issues. This tragic event has raised concerns about the increasing violence against public health workers and the politicization of science, with some former HHS employees attributing the climate of hostility to anti-vaccine rhetoric from figures like Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The CDC has since closed its offices and is conducting an investigation into the shooting.",
