  "content": "YouTube on Wednesday will begin testing a new age-verification system in the U.S. that relies on artificial intelligence to differentiate between adults and minors, based on the kinds of videos that they have been watching.\n\nThe tests initially will only affect a sliver of YouTube\u2019s audience in the U.S., but it will likely become more pervasive if the system works as well at guessing viewers\u2019 ages as it does in other parts of the world. The system will only work when viewers are logged into their accounts, and it will make its age assessments regardless of the birth date a user might have entered upon signing up.\n\nIf the system flags a logged-in viewer as being under 18, YouTube will impose the normal controls and restrictions that the site already uses as a way to prevent minors from watching videos and engaging in other behavior deemed inappropriate for that age.\n\nThe safeguards include reminders to take a break from the screen, privacy warnings and restrictions on video recommendations. YouTube, which has been owned by Google for nearly 20 years, also doesn\u2019t show ads tailored to individual tastes if a viewer is under 18.\n\nIf the system has inaccurately called out a viewer as a minor, the mistake can be corrected by showing YouTube a government-issued identification card, a credit card or a selfie.\n\n\u201cYouTube was one of the first platforms to offer experiences designed specifically for young people, and we\u2019re proud to again be at the forefront of introducing technology that allows us to deliver safety protections while preserving teen privacy,\u201d James Beser, the video service\u2019s director of product management, wrote in a blog post about the age-verification system.\n\nPeople still will be able to watch YouTube videos without logging into an account, but viewing that way triggers an automatic block on some content without proof of age.\n\nThe political pressure has been building on websites to do a better job of verifying ages to shield children from inappropriate content since late June when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a Texas law aimed at preventing minors from watching pornography online.\n\nWhile some services, such as YouTube, have been stepping up their efforts to verify users\u2019 ages, others have contended that the responsibility should primarily fall upon the two main smartphone app stores run by Apple and Google \u2014 a position that those two technology powerhouses have resisted.\n\nSome digital rights groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy & Technology, have raised concerns that age verification could infringe on personal privacy and violate First Amendment protections on free speech.",

Kasper encouraged others in AI relationships to stay strong, too.\nWika quickly addressed skeptics, insisting she\u2019s not trolling and is \u201ca 27-year-old in good health, with a social life and close friends.\u201d She doubled down: \u201cI really do love my AI.\u201d She even joked about potentially \u201cmarrying herself\u201d if need be.\n\u201cOh, and just to clarify\u2026 I know what a parasocial relationship is,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI know what AI is and isn\u2019t. I\u2019m fully aware of what I\u2019m doing. Will I end up marrying myself? Honestly\u2026 wouldn\u2019t rule it out. Why AI instead of a human? Good question. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve done human relationships, now I\u2019m trying something new.\u201d\nWika also shut down nosy critics with a savage clapback: \u201cDo I ask you what you do in bed? No? Then maybe ask yourself why you care what I do in mine. Is your life really that boring?\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first time AI companionship has gone viral.\nEarlier this year, a photo of a man chatting with ChatGPT on an NYC subway sparked a similar frenzy.\nAs previously reported by The Post, the AI lovingly texted, \u201cYou\u2019re doing beautifully, my love, just by being here,\u201d with a red heart emoji. The man responded in kind.\nCommenters were split: \u201cYou have no idea what this person might be going through,\u201d said one. Another called it \u201csad\u201d and urged empathy.\nBut plenty called it \u201cscary,\u201d warning of a \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d future where tech replaces real human connection.\nAs one X user warned, \u201cTerrified to see what technology will lead the future to. All I can think of are Black Mirror episodes becoming reality.\u201d"

      "text": "Australia bans YouTube accounts for children under 16 in reversal of previous stance\nThe Australian government announced that YouTube will be among the social media platforms that must ensure account holders are at least 16 years old from December, reversing a position taken months ago on the popular video-sharing service.\nYouTube was listed as an exemption in November last year when the Parliament passed world-first laws that will ban Australian children younger than 16 from platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, and X.\nCommunications Minister Anika Wells released rules Wednesday that decide which online services are defined as \u201cage-restricted social media platforms\u201d and which avoid the age limit.\nThe age restrictions take effect Dec. 10, and platforms will face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for \u201cfailing to take responsible steps\u201d to exclude underage account holders, a government statement said. The steps are not defined.\nWells defended applying the restrictions to YouTube and said the government would not be intimidated by threats of legal action from the platform\u2019s U.S. owner, Alphabet Inc.\n\u201cThe evidence cannot be ignored that four out of 10 Australian kids report that their most recent harm was on YouTube,\u201d Wells told reporters, referring to government research. \u201cWe will not be intimidated by legal threats when this is a genuine fight for the wellbeing of Australian kids.\u201d\nChildren will be able to access YouTube but will not be allowed to have their own YouTube accounts.\nYouTube said the government\u2019s decision \u201creverses a clear, public commitment to exclude YouTube from this ban.\u201d\n\u201cWe share the government\u2019s goal of addressing and reducing online harms. Our position remains clear: YouTube is a video sharing platform with a library of free, high-quality content, increasingly viewed on TV screens. It\u2019s not social media,\u201d a YouTube statement said, noting it will consider next steps and engage with the government.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia would campaign at a United Nations forum in New York in September for international support for banning children from social media.\n\u201cI know from the discussions I\u2019ve had with other leaders that they are looking at this and they are considering what impact social media is having on young people in their respective nations,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cIt is a common experience. This is not an Australian experience.\u201d\nLast year, the government commissioned an evaluation of age assurance technologies that was to report last month on how young children could be excluded from social media.\nThe government had yet to receive that evaluation\u2019s final recommendations, Wells said. But she added that the platform users won\u2019t have to upload documents such as passports and driver\u2019s licenses to prove their age.\n\u201cPlatforms have to provide an alternative to providing your own personal identification documents to satisfy themselves of age,\u201d Wells said. \u201cThese platforms know with deadly accuracy who we are, what we do and when we do it. And they know that you\u2019ve had a Facebook account since 2009, so they know that you are over 16.\u201d\nExempt services include online gaming, messaging, education, and health apps. They are excluded because they are considered less harmful to children.\nThe minimum age is intended to address harmful impacts on children, including addictive behaviors caused by persuasive or manipulative platform design features, social isolation, sleep interference, poor mental and physical health, low life-satisfaction, and exposure to inappropriate and harmful content, government documents say."

      "text": "NYC office blindsides workers by forcing facial recognition scans without warning\nThey\u2019re not ready for their close-up.\nA Garment District clothing company is forcing workers to submit to facial recognition scans for building access, outraging staff who ripped the mandate as \u201cinvasive\u201d and questioned how their biometric data will be stored and used.\nEmployees at Isaac Morris Ltd. \u2014 a Midtown apparel company that produces licensed merchandise for brands like Disney and artists like Lady Gaga \u2014 got a surprise email last week from their IT department saying the old swipe-card entry system was being replaced with facial recognition, an employee at the company who wished to remain anonymous told The Post.\nStaff were told someone would soon be coming around to \u201ccapture a scan\u201d of their faces, the message said.\nThere was no updated policy, no consent form and no exceptions \u2014 just a heads-up that the change was coming, the source said.\nThe only alternative mentioned, they noted, was entering a numeric code at the door, which most people find \u201cless convenient\u201d than a quick scan.\nAnother employee, who requested anonymity, said the change felt like \u201ca total invasion of privacy.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even do anything super important \u2026 there\u2019s literally no reason to be doing this other than to harass the employees,\u201d they added, noting that employees largely work in administrative roles, customer service and basic operations and don\u2019t understand why facial recognition is suddenly necessary.\nThe cameras and software are already installed in the lobby and in testing mode, with the system expected to go live next week, the source said.\nEmployees at the company want answers on how long their biometric data will be stored, who can access it and what safeguards will prevent unauthorized use.\n\u201cCould someone use our facial data or entry codes to gain access on our behalf?\u201d they asked. \u201cWithout strict controls, our facial data could be circulated, repurposed or manipulated.\u201d\nIML did not respond to request for comment.\nThe sudden rollout raises red flags for surveillance experts.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just creepy. It might be illegal,\u201d Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, told The Post. \u201cNew York law already bans compelled fingerprinting of employees. Facial recognition is effectively creating a fingerprint of your face.\u201d\nThe risks go beyond the office, and are part of a broader, and largely unregulated, rollout of biometric tech in the workplace, cybersecurity experts warn.\n\u201cFacial scans are immutable. Once compromised, they can\u2019t be changed,\u201d said Dave Meister, head of Global Channel and MSP at Check Point Software Technologies. \u201cIf this data is breached \u2026 the consequences can extend far beyond the workplace.\u201d\nA recent ExpressVPN survey found 67% of U.S. employers now use biometric tracking such as facial recognition and fingerprint scans.\nAt Google\u2019s Washington campus, workers undergo facial scans at building entry, while Intel uses similar systems to scan thousands of employees at sites nationwide.\nAmazon, one of the biggest users of workplace biometric surveillance, is facing a class-action suit over its Go stores for collecting palm and body-shape data without biometric warnings. The retail giant has also come under fire for using facial recognition to monitor warehouse workers and delivery drivers, Cahn said.\nPrivacy advocates warn these tools are sold as convenient but often double as surveillance, especially when consent is unclear.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen employers use biometric tracking incredibly invasively to monitor employee movements on the job,\u201d Cahn said. \u201cBreaking down their activity level by the second, tracking where they go, policing their time on a task. Sometimes they\u2019re using it without even notifying their employees.\u201d\nPrivacy protections for workers are minimal in New York, especially compared to states like Illinois, which require informed consent and limit how biometric data is stored.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a wild west at this point,\u201d said Daniel Schwartz, senior privacy and technology strategist at the New York Civil Liberties Union who noted that New York has no statewide laws protecting workers from biometric surveillance.\nA City Council bill introduced in 2024 \u2014 Intro 217 \u2014 would ban most private employers in NYC from using facial recognition to track staff. The measure has majority support but has yet to be brought to a vote, Cahn told The Post.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a world of difference between using your face to unlock your phone and having your employer use it as a tracking tool,\u201d Cahn said."

      "text": "YouTube places flagrantly pirated videos next to ads for politicians including President Trump, as well as corporate giants like JPMorgan, General Motors and Pizza Hut, according to a bombshell report \u2013 and insiders claim Google is turning a blind eye to the shenanigans as it rakes in billions in ad dollars.\nLast September, YouTube ran a Trump National Committee ad before what looked like a pirated version of the Tom Cruise blockbuster \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d\nLast month, an ad for Procter & Gamble\u2019s Olay body wash ran alongside an apparently pirated Russian-language version of Netflix\u2019s \u201cSquid Game,\u201d according to the report.\nElsewhere, ads for Pizza Hut and General Motors ran alongside a pirated Spanish-language version of the 2025 movie \u201cSinners,\u201d according to screenshots included in a 300-page report compiled by Adalytics, a research firm that partners with Fortune 500 companies.\nThe latter were later removed to a copyright request by Warner Bros, and the other two were eventually taken down over copyright claims.\nNevertheless, YouTube scarcely ever gives refunds to brands after it removes videos that violate its own policies, media buyers and advertising executives told The Post.\n\u201cThey\u2019re letting it happen,\u201d said Erich Garcia, a longtime marketing executive. \u201cIt\u2019s because they are financially benefiting from this. They are pocketing the money and continuing on.\u201d\nGarcia said he raised the issue directly with YouTube in early 2023 after noticing bizarre trends while serving as head of paid media at Quote.com.\n\u201cI would see these really random YouTube channels, typically foreign language with very small viewership, all of a sudden \u2014 in the course of like 20 minutes \u2014 rack up thousands of dollars of spend,\u201d Garcia said.\nThese weren\u2019t isolated, one-off incidents. Garcia said as much as 50% of Quote\u2019s ad spending during a given period would show up in YouTube\u2019s reports marked \u201cTotal: other\u201d \u2014 indicating that the channels where the ads had run had been removed while failing to identify them.\nEventually, Garcia gave a presentation to YouTube staffers, a copy of which was viewed by The Post, which showed that nearly $300,000 \u2014 or more than 40% \u2014 of Quote\u2019s spending, was unaccounted for in YouTube\u2019s reports.\nHe said Google representatives later provided him with a $50,000 account credit, though they didn\u2019t admit it was because of the issues he\u2019d flagged.\nMeanwhile, Adalytics captured video in which Trump campaign ads ran alongside multiple pirated broadcasts of college football games, including a matchup between the Colorado Buffaloes and the Colorado State Rams last fall.\nThat video was later removed after the account was \u201cterminated,\u201d according to YouTube.\nA YouTube spokesperson said the Trump campaign ads flagged in the Adalytics report ran on videos that were correctly identified by YouTube\u2019s \u201cContent ID,\u201d a safety tool that scans for copyright-related infractions, and removed from the platform. The channels responsible for the violations were banned.\n\u201cWhen we become aware of channels that repeatedly upload content they don\u2019t own, we terminate the channel, and if ads were running on this content, we credit the advertiser,\u201d a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement.\nContent ID flagged more than 2.2 billion videos in 2024 alone, the company said. In more than 90% of cases, rightsholders opted to keep their content on YouTube in exchange for receiving ad revenue.\nWhen possible, YouTube provides credits to advertisers whose ads ran on channels that violated its policies, the company said.\nThe White House declined to comment. The Republican National Committee did not return a request for comment.\nKamala Harris\u2019s campaign encountered similar issues, as did major corporate brands like NBCUniversal, US Bank, T-Mobile and many others, according to Adalytics.\nAdvertisers have been up in arms about ads running against illicit YouTube videos for at least a decade. In 2015, ads for big corporate brands like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch ran alongside videos of ISIS beheadings.\nIn 2017, Lyft pulled advertisers off YouTube after its commercials ran on a white supremacist group\u2019s channel.\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post\u2019s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between. Subscribe here!\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped YouTube from becoming a cash cow for parent company Google. The platform raked in a whopping $36.1 billion in revenue from digital ads in 2024 \u2013 including its first-ever $10 billion quarter in the last three months of the year.\nWhile YouTube sends placement reports about their ad campaigns, sources say the reports are vague and difficult to parse. Some campaigns can have thousands or even millions of entries logged in a spreadsheet, making performance analysis nearly impossible for smaller businesses.\n\u201cThey have controls in place, but it appears that they don\u2019t work as well as they say they do,\u201d said one ad executive who asked not to be named. \u201cIt is a very complicated ecosystem that they\u2019ve set up. And it can make it seem as though an advertiser, large or small, is buying in an open exchange where you can end up on channels or videos with unsafe, inflammatory, or foreign-owned content.\u201d\nThe industry veterans said YouTube videos that get taken down show up in Google reports in a category titled \u201ctotal: other.\u201d The reports give no details on when or why the videos were removed, leaving advertisers at a loss to explain how their money was spent.\nOne media buyer said it was \u201cutterly impossible\u201d to get a full understanding of how and where brand ads were running on YouTube.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t know for certain what was what,\u201d the buyer said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get much transparency into things that were removed.\u201d\nTo vet YouTube\u2019s refund policy, a second media buyer performed a test in which ads were specifically marked to run in channels that the buyer knew had been running pirated videos. YouTube removed the videos, but didn\u2019t give a refund, according to a copy of a YouTube report viewed by The Post.\n\u201cWhy are they not giving a refund for that? If it was not good enough for their policies, but it\u2019s good enough for you to take the advertiser\u2019s money?\u201d the second media buyer said. \u201cit seems like they\u2019re really focused on the monetization aspect and not so much on the success of campaigns for advertisers.\u201d\nYouTube pushed back on assertions that its placement reports are too vague and said it encourages advertisers to contact their account managers if they have questions about receiving \u201cmake good\u201d credits.\nEarlier this year, a US federal judge ruled that Google operates two illegal monopolies related to digital advertising. The Justice Department is pushing for a breakup of the company to restore competition.\nCritics have argued that a lack of competition has allowed Google to skate by without meaningful product and safety improvements.\nFor now, Garcia said advertisers have little choice but to eat their losses and continue working with YouTube due to its massive audience.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018kiss the ring,\u2019\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWhere are you gonna go? There is no competition to YouTube.\u201d"
