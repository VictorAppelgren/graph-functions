      "summary": "The FOMC chose to keep the federal funds rate target range at 4.25%–4.50%, citing a solid labor market, somewhat elevated inflation, and high economic uncertainty. The Board maintained the reserve balance rate at 4.40% and the primary credit rate at 4.50%. The Committee will continue to reduce its Treasury and agency holdings. The next meeting is scheduled for September 16–17, 2025.",
