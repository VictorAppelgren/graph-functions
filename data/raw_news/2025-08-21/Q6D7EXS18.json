Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways\n\nWhen you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nIt would seem that Netflix\u2019s A Man on the Inside Season 2 is taking a page out of Only Murders in the Building\u2019s playbook and absolutely stacking its ensemble of guest stars. I write that not just because the has cast his real-life wife as his love interest, but there\u2019s an NCIS vet joining the cast in a very fun role, too.\n\nMonths after , we got some information about the new episodes\u2019 release date, story and stars from . We learned the series will return on on November 20, and we finally got to know who Danson\u2019s actual wife, Mary Steenburgen, will be playing, and it\u2019s his love interest! We also got some other new info, as it was announced who Gary Cole will be playing.\n\nAlright, with that said, let\u2019s break down what we know. In the synopsis for the upcoming season, we got a small taste of the new mystery Danson\u2019s character Charles will be trying to solve. We know he\u2019ll be attempting to figure out who is blackmailing the president of Wheeler College, and he\u2019ll go undercover as a professor to try and answer questions like:\n\nAt this point, I know Gary Cole best for his work on NCIS since he took over for Mark Harmon . However, I also know him from films like Dodgeball and other TV shows like The Good Wife. Personally, I can't wait to see him play an \u201ciconoclastic billionaire,\u201d and I think he\u2019ll be really funny in the role too. Honestly, the image below kind of proves that to me, and makes me very excited to see his take on this rich fella:\n\nWhile that\u2019s exciting, I think I\u2019m even more thrilled that Danson\u2019s wife of nearly three decades will be playing his love interest. According to the synopsis, the Book Club actress will portray a teacher who makes Charles feel \u201cfeelings he thought he\u2019d buried after the passing of his wife.\u201d That certainly sounds like the sparks of romance to me, especially when you read the full excerpt:\n\nOf course, Steenburgen and Danson have worked together before. In fact, they met when he auditioned for the play Cross Creek, and their relationship began while they filmed the movie Pontiac Moon. They also played versions of themselves on and starred opposite each other in Gulliver\u2019s Travels and It Must Be Love. So, they\u2019re no stranger to sharing the screen; however, it\u2019s always a dream to see them together.\n\nAlong with these two new additions, Max Greenfield, Michaela Conlin, Jason Mantzoukas, and more are joining the cast, too, meaning we\u2019re in for one funny and lovely time when the series returns on the . So, make sure your is ready, so you can see this new mystery that features a new cast of characters unfold this fall.",

      "text": "Netflix Subscription: The Plans, The Price And What\u2019s Included\nOver the course of the past decade, streaming has become one of the most widely used ways of taking in entertainment, with a seemingly never-ending list of platforms offering a wide range of shows, movies, and other original content. With more than 1.1 billion streaming service subscriptions, it\u2019s easy to see how a lot of people are spending their free time these days. And even though platforms are being introduced all the time, there are reasons to see Netflix as one of the best streaming services around.\nSure, the company may not be as inventive as some of the newer services out there and doesn\u2019t offer things like live sports, news, or all sorts of packaged deals; but Netflix remains one of the best buys for your buck thanks in part to some of its impressive features, plethora of original movies, and increasingly popular series.\nThe Netflix Subscription Plans And Price\nLike several other streaming services, Netflix offers three ad-free plans (more on the ad-supported option later) to choose from that range anywhere from $15.49 per month to $22.99 per month. But unlike platforms like Peacock Premium, which has content exclusive to the more expensive plan, all three Netflix price tiers include the same movies and shows, you\u2019re mainly just paying for better video quality and the number of devices that can stream simultaneously. Here are the tiers and prices as of May 2024:\nThen there\u2019s the \u201cStandard\u201d plan, which costs $15.49 per month and allows you to watch on two devices at the same time with a maximum resolution of 1080p, or full high definition.\nThen there\u2019s the \u201cPremium\u201d plan, which costs $22.99 per month but you will be able to stream on four devices (perfect for families) at a maximum picture quality of 4K ultra-high definition.\nSign up for a Netflix subscription.\nNetflix Also Has A Cheaper, Ad-Supported Plan\nBack in April 2022, Netflix revealed that in addition to the three standard tiers, it was planning to offer an ad-supported plan at a cheaper monthly price similar to HBO Max, Peacock, Paramount+, and multiple other streaming services. There were various updates the next few months about how the ad process would work for the lower-priced tier before the platform announced in October that the new plan would become available on November 3rd and would cost $6.99 per month. This has it sitting $3 cheaper than the \u201cBasic\u201d option.\nThere are some things to keep in mind when it comes to Netflix\u2019s ad-supported model, which is being called \u201cBasic with Ads.\u201d If you go with this model, you can expect to sit through four to five minutes of ads per hour. These ads will range anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds in length, and will play before and during movies and shows. Just like the \u201cBasic\u201d plan, the ad-supported version has a maximum resolution of 720p.\nIt should also be noted that select titles won\u2019t be available with this option, which seems to be industry standard with this type of plan. In November 2022, Deadline reported that Netflix original series like House of Cards and Arrested Development were not available for the \"Basic with Ads\" option as the shows are not owned by the streamer but instead licensed out. Other shows missing from this option include Peaky Blinders, The Good Place, The Sinner, and Good Girl, to name only a few.\nNetflix Supported Devices\nSometimes you want to watch your favorite streaming service but it\u2019s not available on whichever device you have, turning a movie-watching experience into a literal nightmare. Luckily for anyone with a Netflix subscription, that\u2019s not usually a problem (as long as everything is updated).\nCurrently, Netflix is available on all the major streaming boxes like Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV, Chromecast, and even Portal from Facebook. This is also true for most smart TVs from Samsung, LG, Sony, Sharp, and countless others. All PlayStation and XBOX consoles have it as well, even PS Vita which Sony gave up on years ago. Nintendo fans, however, are out of luck and will have to settle for Hulu or YouTube. Most smartphones, tablets, and web browsers will also allow you to watch Netflix with little to no trouble.\nNetflix Offers A Collection Of Video Games On Supported Devices\nOne feature that doesn\u2019t get talked about all that much is the small library of free games that come with a Netflix subscription. In addition to the thousands of movies, shows, documentaries, and specials available to subscribers, the service also offers more than two dozen mobile games at no extra charge. And unlike a lot of other free games, those offered aren\u2019t filled with ads and don\u2019t require in-app purchases (this is especially nice for parents with young, game-obsessed kids).\nThe library of games includes titles inspired by shows like Stranger Things, as well as an assortment of action, arcade, card, party, and puzzle games, with a great deal of variety. To play, all you have to do is open the app on your mobile device (they aren\u2019t available on streaming devices like Roku or through web browsers), and tap on the game you want to play. After that, you\u2019ll be met by a prompt to download it through your device\u2019s app store. Then you\u2019re set.\nCheck out Netflix\u2019s games website.\nInteractive Titles On Netflix\nA Netflix subscription also comes with access to the streamer\u2019s library of interactive movies and shows. These range from movies like Black Mirror: Bandersnatch that plays out like a \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d novel to Minecraft: Story Mode and the Triviaverse competition program.\nSelect Netflix Movies And Shows Can Be Downloaded For Offline Viewing\nOne of the coolest Netflix functions, one that has saved more than a few long car rides with shoddy internet service, is the ability to download select movies and shows for offline viewing. There are some drawbacks though, as not every movie and show is available to be downloaded and the service isn\u2019t available on all devices. Also, it should be noted that the download function is not available to subscribers with the new \u201cBasic with Ads\u201d option.\nBut if you want to catch up on some of your favorite Netflix originals on an Apple mobile device, Android devices, or an Amazon Fire tablet, all you have to do is click on the \u201cDownload\u201d button on the Netflix app. You\u2019ll be binging without using all your phone\u2019s data in no time at all.\nHaving Multiple Netflix Profiles Prevents Issues With Your Recommendations\nThe Netflix recommendation algorithm can be a little delicate at times and all it takes is one random kids show to ruin your curated list of movies, shows, and documentaries. To prevent any of these issues, you can make profiles for each person in your house who\u2019s using your subscription. Having individual profiles also allows you to use some of Netflix\u2019s parental guards so you don\u2019t walk in on your kids watching any of the sexually explicit movies when they should be watching CoComelon.\nAnother good reason to have multiple profiles is that it prevents you from losing your spot with your favorite show in the event that you and your roommate or significant other are watching the same program but at different times and paces. Just nip that problem in the bud. And that's just one of the Netflix little things that improve your Netflix experience.\nProfiles Can Now Be Transferred To New Accounts\nNetflix made waves in early 2022 when the streaming service announced its intentions to crack down on password sharing among family and friends. Although the decision drew the ire of some subscribers, the platform\u2019s decision to push forward with the plan has resulted in a fairly ingenious way of helping people split up accounts without losing their watchlists or curated recommendations that have been constructed over the years. This comes in the form of what the company calls Profile Transfer tool.\nAnnounced in October 2022, the tool allows account holders to transfer those extra profiles used by friends, family, and former significant others to a new account. No longer will there be a need for an awkward conversation, risk of a locked account, or the fear of starting fresh with a vanilla Netflix profile.\nCheck out the Profile Transfer tool.\nNetflix started the rollout of these password sharing rules in various territories in February 2023, with plans to expand the program later in the year.\nNetflix Continues To Add Original Movies And TV Shows\nThe list of the best movies on Netflix continues to grow as time goes on and the quality seems to be improving all the time. If you want to catch all those original movies like Blonde, The School of Good and Evil, and Luckiest Girl Alive, then Netflix is going to give it to you. Even when you take the prestige films out of the picture, there are so many original movies being added every week, giving you an endless amount of romantic comedies, dramas, and over-the-top action flicks\nAnd then there are all those can\u2019t-miss and binge-worthy TV shows on Netflix like Stranger Things, The Watcher, and Dahmer \u2013 Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story that make your monthly subscription more than worth it.\nAnd thanks to deals with studios like Sony Pictures, Netflix subscribers can also watching movies like Where the Crawdads Sing, Morbius, and Bullet Train streaming.\nThe Netflix Top 10 Provides A Daily List Of Trending Movies And TV Shows\nSince February 2020, the service has provided its subscribers with a daily breakdown of all the trending titles, split up in movies and TV shows lists. The Netflix Top 10 is a good way of checking out new Netflix releases, seeing what subscribers in your country are digging on any given day, and learning about classic movies and shows that have recently been added to the platform.\nThese two lists are updated every day and are a fun way to spend a few minutes to see how much has changed over the course of a 24-hour period.\nWith the list of features getting better all the time (and new movies and shows being added daily), a Netflix subscription is a great way to spend your hard-earned cash and keep yourself entertained, which won't be that hard considering all the upcoming movie and shows coming to the platform in 2024.."

Hayes/Netflix Ted Danson is on the case again in A Man on the Inside season 2 \u2014 and he's not alone. In March, it was revealed that Danson would be joined by his wife, Academy Award and Golden Globe winner Mary Steenburgen, in the second season of the acclaimed Netflix comedy, but her role was kept largely under wraps at the time. Now, in the first sneak peek at the new season, above and below, the curtain is being peeled back. From the looks of it, the real-life couple \u2014 who celebrate their 30th anniversary in October \u2014 will be playing an adorable onscreen one. Mary Steenburgen as Mona, Ted Danson as Charles in 'A Man on the Inside' season 2. Colleen E. Hayes/Netflix To recap, season 1 followed Charles (Danson), a retired man who gets a new lease on life when he answers an ad from a private investigator and becomes a mole in a secret investigation in a nursing home. In season 2, he gets his next case, when a mysterious blackmailer targets the president of Wheeler College, Jack Berenger (Max Greenfield), who enlists Charles to go undercover this time around as a professor.

Does it have something to do with the iconoclastic billionaire Brad Vinick (Gary Cole), a Wheeler graduate, and his proposed donation to the school? Charles finds no shortage of possible suspects, but his attention gets diverted by free-spirited music teacher Mona (Steenburgen), whose zest for life awakens feelings he thought he\u2019d buried after the passing of his wife. Is he ready to open his heart again at this stage in his life? And more importantly, has he fallen for the very criminal he's been sent to unmask?\" Oh l\u00e0 l\u00e0! Ted Danson opens up about what he'd want in 'A Man on the Inside' season 2, and that 'warm hug' finale cameo 'A Man on the Inside' star Ted Danson just wants to 'try to be funny at every age' Also in season 2, Netflix teases that Charles' daughter Emily (Mary Elizabeth Ellis) is inspired by the changes she's seen in her dad, and uncovers a long-ignored passion of her own, while PI Julie (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) is also back, and embarks on her own journey of growth as she reconnects with an important figure from her past.

But in the meantime, it's never a bad idea to watch some of the best movies on Netflix or binge one or two of the best Netflix shows.\nPhilip grew up in Louisiana (not New Orleans) before moving to St. Louis after graduating from Louisiana State University-Shreveport. When he's not writing about movies or television, Philip can be found being chased by his three kids, telling his dogs to stop barking at the mailman, or chatting about professional wrestling to his wife. Writing gigs with school newspapers, multiple daily newspapers, and other varied job experiences led him to this point where he actually gets to write about movies, shows, wrestling, and documentaries (which is a huge win in his eyes). If the stars properly align, he will talk about For Love Of The Game being the best baseball movie of all time.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "The Hilarious Reason Ted Danson Agreed To Be In Curb Your Enthusiasm\nTed Danson has had a good history with HBO, playing a lead in Bored to Death as well as appearing on Curb Your Enthusiasm. However, in a recent profile interview, the CSI: Cyber actor revealed that his role in Curb happened following an early screening of the HBO comedy that didn\u2019t go as well as expected. You can check out the hilarious full story, below.\nSpeaking with the AV Club, Danson\u2019s account more than implies that the original pilot for Curb Your Enthusiasm was terrible. It wasn\u2019t even bad in a good way, it was so forgettable that people even fell asleep\u2014a feat for a TV show, which doesn\u2019t run nearly as long as a movie. If Danson hadn\u2019t felt so bad for Larry David while watching the pilot, it\u2019s unlikely the actor would have said yes to the series, as he also mentions that he had been stuck for too long in \u201cthe half hour comedy party.\u201d If the pilot had been better, he probably would have missed out on a pretty memorable role.\nHowever, it all turned out to be pretty, pretty good. Danson and his real-life wife Mary Steenburgen popped up on the HBO comedy playing a TV version of themselves and ended up first appearing the second episode in Season 1. He later was a part of numerous episodes of the show-often with his wife in toe\u2014frequently butting heads with Larry, as often happens on Curb. While Danson has hopped to CBS and taken drama roles like CSI and Fargo in the time since, we\u2019re happy he stuck with comedy for this gig. Danson seems to acknowledge this too, actually noting:\nCurb Your Enthusiasm hasn\u2019t produced a new season since 2011, but the show ended on an open-ended enough note that it could theoretically come back at any time. In fact, every few months someone related to the show tends to discuss the chances of Curb Your Enthusiasm\u2019s eventual return, and they look good. So, with a little luck, maybe we\u2019ll eventually get a ninth season of the comedy. If it does happen, we\u2019ll be sure to let you know.\nFor now, here\u2019s what TV shows HBO has coming up at midseason.\nYour Daily Blend of Entertainment News\nJessica Rawden is Managing Editor at CinemaBlend.

      "text": "2025 TV Premiere Date Schedule: August's Highlights Include Wednesday Season 2, King Of The Hill's Return, And Peacemaker\nPlus the late Anne Burrell's final TV appearances.\nThe easiest way to beat the pummeling summer heat, assuming one isn't a mad scientist hellbent on blotting out the sun, is to sit comfortably indoors with the TV blaring. Because even though the list of 2025's canceled and ending series keeps growing, so does the lineup of new and returning shows, and there's absolutely something for everyone coming in July and beyond.\nThe upcoming months are filled with exciting arrivals, including some of the biggest Netflix releases of this year (yeah, I'm looking at you, Stranger Things) and quite a few upcoming horror shows that should be exciting for genre fans like myself.\nSo without further ado, let's take a closer look at all the biggest premieres heading to the small screen in August 2025, from Wednesday Season 2 to the long-awaited return of King of the Hill to another round of NFL action on Hard Knocks.\n[Note that all times listed in the schedule below are for the ET/EST time zone, and that all brand-new series premieres will be listed in ALL CAPS.]\nAugust 2025 TV Premiere Dates\nAugust 2025 will bring about Jason Momoa's return to the small screen for Apple TV+'s new streaming drama, with Jenna Ortega set to break more Netflix records with the second season of her global smash Wednesday.
