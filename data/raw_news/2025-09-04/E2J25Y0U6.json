  "title": "Bitcoin May Gain as Dollar Drops and Bond Yields Climb, Experts Say",
  "description": "A weaker U.S. dollar and rising long-term bond yields are fueling expectations that Bitcoin could see renewed gains, analysts say.",
  "content": "A weakening U.S. dollar, rising governance risks, and yield curve steepening are creating a bullish narrative for Bitcoin, according to a Thursday investment note from Singapore-based QCP Capital.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index (DXY), which tracks the value of the U.S. dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies, has shed 11% of its value since the first half of this year and is currently hovering around 98.23.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest decline since 1973\u2013more than 50 years ago,\u201d Stephen Gregory, founder of crypto trading platform Vtrader, told Decrypt.\n\nWith gold hitting an all-time high of $3,578 on September 3, Gregory said, \u201cIt is evident that U.S. institutions are hedging the declining dollar.\u201d The liquidity from gold is likely to follow into \u201cfixed supply assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum,\u201d he said.\n\nThe decline in the U.S. dollar comes amid a bond market sell-off, with experts citing inflation concerns as the primary reason for the surge in 30-year yields across the U.S., the UK, Australia, and Japan.\n\n\u201cIt's really unusual for a 30-year Treasury yield to rise in a Fed easing cycle,\u201d Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Global Economy and Development program, tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin Derivatives Traders Are Betting on Further Upside Despite September Risks\n\nMany countries previously shifted their debt issuance to short-term maturities, leading to a global increase in long-term government bond yields, Brooks noted in a subsequent tweet, \u201ca move that may be coming back to haunt us.\u201d\n\nIn addition to maintaining a focus on short-term maturities, most central banks worldwide have already begun easing or are anticipating further easing, thereby keeping the front-end anchored.\n\nThe recent bond sell-off, however, has widened the gap between short- and long-term yields, steepening the yield curve. In other words, investors are demanding higher returns to lend money for longer periods.\n\nAdding to this complex mix are growing concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence. President Donald Trump has repeatedly applied pressure to Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower rates, in an effort to service the U.S.\u2019s high levels of interest on its sovereign debt.\n\nAccording to QCP, that fear is why the premiums remain \u201chigher at the long end, causing the yield curve to steepen.\u201d\n\nA steepening yield curve \u201csignals rising inflation expectations, but it can also signal that investors believe the economy will grow,\u201d Gregory said.\n\nWith inflation on the rise, \u201crisk assets like Bitcoin tend to outperform the market,\u201d he explained, \u201cperhaps this is the perfect backdrop for a crypto supercycle.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s year-to-date return hovers around 96%, down nearly 11% from its record high of $124,545, CoinGecko data shows. Gold, however, hit an all-time high of 3,578 on Tuesday and is up 35% this year.",

Markets are pricing in a higher term premium at the long end, and setting a lower bar for a US dollar down-cycle. In practice, even with easing, that mix tends to steepen the curve, soften the dollar, and support gold and BTC as investors seek compensation for inflation and governance risk.\nPolicy backdrop: Jackson Hole nudged the balance of risks toward labour-market cooling. That keeps a September cut in play, even if inflation is unlikely to glide to 2% quickly. The front-end stays anchored by an easing bias, while the long end remains sticky so long as the term premium stays elevated.\nTwo cuts this year look reasonable, but keep an eye on breakevens, as new tariffs could push expectations higher. With policy uncertainty lingering, a softer US dollar is more likely so long as global growth holds up. Gold and BTC remain straightforward hedges in this backdrop.\nReceives Financial Services Permission from ADGM\u2019s FSRA to bridge key institutional markets in Asia and the Middle East ABU DHABI, 4 September 2025 \u2013 QCP\nInto September, the story is less the cut itself and more the lingering questions about the Fed\u2019s independence.

CoinGecko! As crypto traders and investors ourselves, we understand the hassle of browsing multiple websites and exchanges to find reliable information and market data for a coin. That\u2019s why we built CoinGecko \u2013 so you can access all crypto information in one place.\nGet Reliable Live Cryptocurrency Prices\nCrypto prices and market data have always been at the core of our product \u2013 it\u2019s what we do best. We provide unbiased cryptocurrency data for the community, whether to help you make an investment decision or check the value of your crypto assets.\nWe use an average price as crypto prices vary between markets. Crypto prices on an exchange depend on its market condition, influenced by factors like liquidity, trading pairs, offerings, and economic conditions. As exchanges may sometimes show abnormal prices, the crypto community relies on tools like CoinGecko for more accurate coin prices.\nWe Offer Market Data, Crypto Charts & Latest News\nCrypto prices alone don\u2019t mean much, so we\u2019ve included data like market cap and fully diluted value. It\u2019s only when you pair current prices with historical data, statistics, news, and more that you get a full picture of a coin\u2019s performance.\nAnother popular feature on CoinGecko is our free and powerful crypto charts. What\u2019s neat is you can compare a coin\u2019s performance against Bitcoin and/or Ethereum on a single graph. Our price charts come in both line and candlestick formats, and we also offer market cap charts.\nHow Does CoinGecko Calculate Crypto Prices?\nOur prices are calculated using an average price formula based on available trading pairs across multiple exchanges. We also have algorithms to detect and exclude anomalous tickers from our prices.

It\u2019s used to determine the valuation of a cryptocurrency based on the total money invested, not just the price.\nWhy Is Crypto Market Cap Important?\nInvestors use crypto market caps to determine if a coin has more room for growth or is currently overvalued by comparing it to established cryptocurrencies with similar use cases as a benchmark. While market cap is important, it\u2019s only one of many factors to consider when investing in a coin.\nHow To Compare Crypto Market Cap?\nCrypto market cap can be divided into three categories:\n- Large-cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have market caps above $10 billion. These established projects have higher liquidity and lower risks.\n- Mid-cap cryptocurrencies have market caps between $1 billion and $10 billion. They have higher growth potential than large-cap coins but are also riskier.\n- Small-cap cryptocurrencies have market caps below $1 billion. They are usually new projects with the potential for exponential growth but have lower liquidity and higher risk.\nThese categories are often used in investment strategies, and a \u201cgood market cap\u201d depends on your risk appetite. If you\u2019re willing to take on higher risks, you can look into small- or mid-cap cryptocurrencies. For risk-averse investors, consider large-cap cryptocurrencies.\nList of Top Ranking Cryptocurrencies\nOur cryptocurrency list features the top cryptocurrencies today, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and over ten thousand altcoins. What sets our list apart is we aggregate cryptos from various exchanges to give a full picture of the crypto market and not just for coins on a particular exchange.\nOur team curates the cryptocurrency list.

Market cap represents the market share of a coin or token, so the higher the crypto rank, the more dominant it is in the crypto market.\nWhat Are Altcoins?\nAltcoins are every other cryptocurrency created after Bitcoin, and they can be coins or tokens. Coins are native currencies to the blockchain, while tokens are cryptos built on the blockchain.\nThere are many types of altcoins. Stablecoins are altcoins whose value is pegged to assets like fiat currencies and commodities. Another example is governance tokens, which let you vote for the Web3 project\u2019s future.

  "argos_summary": "Bitcoin could rally as the U.S. dollar weakens and long\u2011term U.S. Treasury yields rise, creating a hedge\u2011like environment for risk assets. The steepening yield curve signals higher inflation expectations and a potential growth outlook, boosting demand for Bitcoin and gold. Market participants are betting on further upside for BTC amid rising 30\u2011year yields and Fed policy uncertainty. The rally is expected to unfold over the next few weeks as the dollar continues to slide and term premiums stay elevated.",
