  "title": "Powell Won\u2019t Nod to a Cut at Jackson Hole: Former Fed Governor Betsy Duke",
  "description": "Former Federal Reserve Governor Betsy Duke discusses the Fed\u2019s dual mandate, inflation concerns, and her expectations for Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech Friday at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Do you believe that we do see a dual mandate in conflict. I'm not sure it's quite in conflict yet. When you look at the unemployment numbers and you go back to the last projections that the Fed did, the median participant thought that the long term rate of unemployment would be at 4.2, which is exactly where we are. So I'm not sure that the the the number of jobs created because of supply side issues, as you were discussing, is enough for you to consider that out of whack. So, Betsy, coming into this speech from Chairman Powell, I just wonder how much has actually changed for him since we got that payroll report a few Fridays ago. I don't think a lot has changed. The the payroll numbers are the most unreliable indicator that you get because they're so frequently revised. And the revisions, I think the average revision is 100,000 jobs. So. So that is huge. I'll tell you one story. When we when I was at the Fed with Jay and we were discussing watching QE three and there was a lot of concern amongst Jay, myself and and and Jeremy about wanting QE three and we got a bad payroll number. We launch QE three a year later. When you look at how that number had been adjusted, it would not have justified wanting QE three at all. So then, Betsy, this time around, if he's having to deal with those inputs, but then also having to deal with Muslim Daly Ironically. Cooke who have all turned more dovish. Does Powell necessarily need to incorporate those views when he speaks? Does he need to also have some of that dovish lean incorporated into his outlook because some of the rest of the FOMC is going there? He is always aware of where every member of the FOMC is, because the job of the chairman is to lead. It's not to set policy and force everybody to agree. The job of the chairman is to lead and to know where all of the participants, all the members of the FOMC are at any given time. If the if his speech, though, also has to do with cementing his legacy. Betsey, considering where we go from here, considering there'll be a new Fed governor in 2026, you know the man well, what do you expect that to look like from Powell? What does it sound like to have a Fed chair who tries to come out and defend independence and have that legacy, but without provoking the politics of the moment and the White House? So I think Jay Powell, in terms of his legacy, is looking at what happens to his mandate, what happens to inflation, what happens to employment, and how well does he manage that. It's not any single speech. And and I would be shocked if if he was given it that way. Bet you think there is a bias when it comes to handling and targeting inflation over, say, the prospects for the labor market. Do you have a bias? Is there an inherent bias on the committee to prioritize one over the other? You know, So everybody who comes on the committee ultimately gets labeled as a hawk or a dove. I, I don't think it's that clear cut. I think, you know, for myself, I probably do have a bit of a bias on inflation because, you know, I started my career in the seventies, in the Volcker years when when inflation was just out of control. But but I don't think there's a real bias inside the room one way or the other. It's more a matter of which one seems the most difficult to manage at the time. And what do you think is the most difficult to manage right now? I still think inflation is much more difficult. And do you think it gets harder in the months to come? Do you suspect we will see more pass through from the tariffs? Well, yeah, it's going to be very hard to determine once you start getting pass through. Is that pass through a one time price change or is it going to be persistent? And you really, really they're going to be watching what expectations are. Inflation expectations are going to be the key over the next year or two. If inflation expectations get out of line, then the Fed will be very concerned. But Betsy, isn't there an argument to be made which Neel Dutta Renaissance macro makes that it's the direction of travel that's troubling, that inflation, for the most part, has been traveling in the right way, but the labor market is traveling in the wrong way. I again, I just don't see that. I think inflation has been fairly steady. It hasn't been coming down as much as I would have expected if if the current setting of monetary policy was as restrictive as some seem to think. So, Betsy, just bringing back around about what we're going to get from the Fed governor tomorrow, do you expect there to be any change for how we view where the path of policy is after we hear from Jay Powell or will tomorrow be inconsequential as far as that goes? If where we means where we the media, where we investors think policy is going, I think there may be a change because I don't see any any chance that there's a nod toward a September cut or any promise of a September cut. I think he's going to focus primarily on the decision framework and not gives any indication of where he's leaning for September.",

  "summary": "Former Fed Governor, Betsy Duke, discusses the dual mandate of Chairman Powell and the role of the Federal Reserve (Fed Chairman), stating that the number of jobs created due to supply-side issues is not enough to suggest that the long-term rate of unemployment is out of whack. Duke also discusses the impact of the payroll numbers, which are often revised due to their large number of jobless numbers, and the potential for inflation. She also questions whether Powell will need to incorporate these views into his speech to cement his legacy, particularly in light of the potential impact on his ability to defend the Fed's independence and maintain this legacy without upsetting the White House. Duke suggests that the current Fed policy setting of monetary policy was restrictive and that current inflation hasn't been seen as much as expected if it would have been expected.",

  "argos_summary": "The article presents a discussion about the Federal Reserve\u2019s dual mandate, focusing on the reliability of payroll data, the impact of revisions, and how these factors influence policy decisions. It examines Chairman Powell\u2019s upcoming speech, noting that he is likely to emphasize the decision framework rather than hint at a September rate cut, while also considering his legacy and the political context. The conversation touches on the balance between inflation and employment, with speakers arguing that inflation remains the more challenging variable to manage. Overall, the piece highlights the complexities of Fed policy, the influence of FOMC members, and the importance of inflation expectations for future monetary policy.",
