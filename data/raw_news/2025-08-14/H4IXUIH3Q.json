      "text": "CoTec is a next-generation resource company focused on transforming undervalued mineral assets into high-margin operations through the deployment of breakthrough extraction and processing technologies.\nOur approach targets low-grade and complex deposits that have historically been uneconomic. By leveraging technologies that dramatically reduce water and energy usage compared to traditional methods, CoTec unlocks new sources of critical minerals with improved economics and sustainability.\nWe currently hold investments in six transformative technologies and three mineral assets, providing exposure to key commodities such as rare earths, iron ore, and copper. Our strategy is to acquire and operate assets where our technologies offer a clear advantage\u2014creating value through scalability, strategic partnerships, and ultimately spinning off these businesses as standalone operations.\nCoTec is publicly listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and OTCQB under the symbols TSX-V: CTH and OTCQB: CTHCF.\nCoTec invests in disruptive, scalable technologies that have the potential to fundamentally change how minerals and metals are extracted, refined, and processed. We focus on early-stage innovations with commercial potential and back them with decades of operational experience and a highly engaged Board of Directors.\nWhat sets CoTec apart is our dual network: deep roots in the global resource extraction industry, and strong connections to technology funds, universities, innovation labs, and forward-thinking mining professionals. This unique positioning enables us to accelerate the development and deployment of next-generation technologies.\nFor more advanced technologies, CoTec pursues joint ventures and partnerships to fast-track commercial applications. In an industry often slow to adopt change, we bring an entrepreneurial mindset and a nimble approach\u2014ready to move where incumbents hesitate.\nWe scale value through a two-pronged strategy:\nCoTec is building a new kind of resource company\u2014one that brings together innovation and ownership to deliver profitability, efficiency, and long-term value.\nAt CoTec, we believe the future of resource production will be defined by innovation. We\u2019re not just following the transition\u2014we\u2019re building it, by backing breakthrough technologies that can unlock value where others can\u2019t.\nGlobal demand for critical minerals is accelerating, but traditional mining methods alone won\u2019t meet the moment. CoTec is pioneering a new model: we invest in and deploy proven, disruptive technologies that make it possible to extract and process materials more efficiently, more cleanly, and from sources previously considered uneconomic\u2014such as legacy stockpiles, tailings, and recycled material.\nWhat sets us apart is our strategy. We don\u2019t just fund technology\u2014we own it, and integrate it into undervalued assets we control, creating a clear path from innovation to production. Our goal is to build a portfolio of scalable, cost-effective operations that can meet the growing demand for critical minerals\u2014with faster timelines, lower capital intensity, and stronger margins.\nWe\u2019ve already screened hundreds of technologies, invested in only the most credible and commercially viable, and are now entering the next phase: applying them to real-world assets to create long-term value."
