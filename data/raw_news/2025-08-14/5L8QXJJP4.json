      "text": "The collaboration will see FIS infrastructure solutions, including the FIS Money Movement Hub, integrated with Circle\u2019s stablecoin functionality, the companies said in a Monday (July 28) press release.\nThis combination will enable U.S. financial institutions to enable their customers to make domestic and cross-border payments in USDC, according to the release.\n\u201cBy providing our clients with direct access to USDC functionality within a regulated and compliant framework, they in turn will be able to offer their customers greater choice in payment methods than ever before,\u201d Jim Johnson, co-president, banking solutions at FIS, said in the release.\nKash Razzaghi, chief business officer at Circle, said in the release that the GENIUS Act becoming law has brought stablecoins into mainstream finance and has given financial institutions a new option for moving money quickly, transparently and economically.\n\u201cPayment stablecoins represent a significant opportunity for U.S. financial institutions to modernize and stay competitive,\u201d Razzaghi said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re partnering with FIS \u2014 by combining FIS\u2019 ubiquitous banking and payments technology ecosystem with Circle\u2019s blockchain-native infrastructure and USDC, we\u2019re unlocking settlement at internet scale.\u201d\nFIS debuted its Money Movement Hub on May 1, saying the tool helps financial institutions link to payment networks and process payments in one place.\nThe Money Movement Hub integrates with major payment networks \u2014 including instant payment services, wire and ACH \u2014 within one solution via a single API. It can also increase the accuracy of payments, improve liquidity and help solve security risks, the company said at the time.\nThe tool is designed for institutions ranging from \u201csuper regional\u201d banks to community lenders, per the company.\nIt was reported June 13, a week after Circle went public, that Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said that the stablecoin issuer sees opportunities to partner with a wide range of companies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous opportunity as the world connects to this new form of currency on the internet,\u201d Allaire said at the time. \u201cWe see tremendous opportunities to collaborate with major technology firms, major payments companies, major financial institutions, and we already do.\u201d"

      "text": "Although the company raised its full-year guidance, third-quarter margin projections seemed to disappoint investors, who sent the shares down 9% Tuesday morning.\nAdjusted revenues were up 5% to $2.6 billion in the second quarter, where banking solutions sales were up 6%, according to an earnings presentation. The company boosted its full-year revenue growth outlook to a gain of 4.8% to 5.3%, where that range had previously been 4.6% to 5.2%. Prior adjusted EBITDA margins had been 41.3%; in the revised guidance, that metric stands at 41%.\nThe Banking Momentum\nDuring a conference call with analysts, CEO Stephanie Ferris said second-quarter revenue growth accelerated from the beginning of the year, underpinned by \u201cmomentum in banking\u201d and by strength in digital solutions.\nThe Global Payments issuer business acquisition and the sale of the minority Worldpay stake remain on track, according to management commentary on the call.\n\u201cWe continue to work with international regulators, and the acquisition close remains on schedule,\u201d Ferris said. \u201cThis transaction adds best-in-class credit issuing solutions to our end-to-end banking offerings, creating immediate cross-sell opportunity and complements our broad suite of best-in-class solutions.\u201d\nAI and Stablecoins\nIn reference to artificial intelligence, the company is on track to launch its Banker Assist solution by year-end, which Ferris described on the call as \u201cthe agentic AI platform for commercial banking that embeds intelligent, voice-powered assistance directly into client interaction.\u201d\nChief Financial Officer James Kehoe said during the call that recurring revenue growth continued to outpace adjusted revenue. Within the capital markets segment, he said: \u201cAdjusted revenue growth came in at 5%, slightly below our expectations, with recurring revenue growth of 5%.\u201d\nMacro uncertainty impacted the lending business, he said, adding: \u201cThe good news is that we have seen a rebound in July with lending activity returning more in line with the strong pace we experienced in the first quarter.\u201d\nAsked on the call about the growth in the banking business, Ferris said that \u201cwe are selling more than we have been over the last couple of years, and the quality of those sales is strong. So, we talked about a couple of years ago selling not just professional services and license, but really focusing on selling higher-margin products, so, think digital, think payments, think software that is recurring and that really focuses the business on those new sales.\u201d\nShe said there\u2019s also interest in stablecoins and \u201ceverybody is looking in terms of the use cases. But certainly, every single financial institution is looking at how they serve their clients and make it available. So, I would say demand is much higher. [It remains] TBD in terms of which use cases take effect.\u201d\nAnalysts also delved into pricing and competition in the market tied to processing during the call.\n\u201cOur pricing is very consistent,\u201d Ferris said. \u201cSo, when you think about it in terms of either what we have to price on new wins or compression, I think what you\u2019re hearing from a lot of people is likely challenges in terms of quality of products and then corresponding pricing that they have to take. But from an FIS standpoint, again, we stand very large and scaled, and so we can get pretty price-competitive if we need to. It is not impacting our overall revenue.\u201d\nBoth businesses \u2014 banking and capital markets \u2014 had positive net pricing trends, Kehoe said on the call.\nFerris also said that banks, particularly small banks, are \u201clooking for FIS to provide them with their modernization journey. We\u2019ve already put all of our clients generally in the cloud.\u201d\nModernization is generally about componentization of the core, she said.\n\u201cAnd in the larger financial institution standpoint, there is a desire to do more componentized and come out with products and solutions and deliver value more quickly than a big bang core conversion,\u201d she said during the call."
