With corporate earnings showing robust growth, particularly in sectors like communications and technology, dividend stocks on the TSX present a compelling opportunity for those seeking stable income amidst a backdrop of mixed bond yields and potential interest rate adjustments by the Bank of Canada.\n\nClick here to see the full list of 21 stocks from our Top TSX Dividend Stocks screener.\n\nLet's take a closer look at a couple of our picks from the screened companies.\n\nOverview: IGM Financial Inc. operates in the asset management industry in Canada, with a market cap of CA$11.23 billion.\n\nOperations: IGM Financial Inc. generates its revenue primarily from two segments: Asset Management, contributing CA$1.30 billion, and Wealth Management, which accounts for CA$2.57 billion.\n\nIGM Financial's dividend payments are supported by a reasonable payout ratio of 54.7% and cash flow coverage of 56.5%, ensuring sustainability despite the lack of growth over the past decade.
