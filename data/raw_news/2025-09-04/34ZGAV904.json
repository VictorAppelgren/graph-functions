  "title": "I\u2019m both confused and intrigued by Samsung\u2019s bizarre Movingstyle TV",
  "description": "The Movingstyle is a portable, rotatable, drawable TV tablet hybrid.",
  "content": "Samsung had plenty of announcements during its IFA 2025 press conference, but one product stood out for me among the onslaught of AI chat (AI was mentioned over 90 times, we\u2019re told) \u2013 the oddly named Movingstyle.\n\nThe bizarre name is just the beginning. The Movingstyle is a 27-inch portable, touchscreen TV, with a built-in carry handle and kick stand. There\u2019s even a podium stand, so you don\u2019t have to hold it when a surface isn\u2019t available.\n\nThere\u2019s a built-in battery too, which Samsung says can last around three hours \u2013 the length of a director\u2019s cut movie or two soccer matches, Samsung\u2019s Executive Vice President and Head of Digital Appliances, Cheolgi Kim (CK) tell us.\n\nAs mentioned this is not just a standard display, but also a touchscreen one. It packs Samsung\u2019s Vision AI interface found on the brand\u2019s TVs, giving you access to widgets, an AI chatbot, and various apps.\n\nFancy doing some drawing? Well you can, with a Paint-style application allowing you to doodle to your hearts content.\n\nThe screen also benefits from some of Samsung\u2019s TV tech, including adaptive brightness and sound, which react to the lighting and noise conditions around you.\n\nWith a built in carry handle, the Movingstyle is distinctly more portable than the TV currently sitting in your living room. But it\u2019s also rather heavy.\n\nI haven\u2019t got the exact weight figures, but this isn\u2019t something you\u2019d want to be carrying long distances. And to be fair to Samsung, it\u2019s designed to only really be moved around the home.\n\nThe good news is the handle, which also doubles as a kickstand, feels sturdy \u2013 not like the flimsy piece of plastic on the back of the original Nintendo Switch.\n\nThere\u2019s also a separate podium stand (which I imagine will be sold separately, but I\u2019m waiting on confirmation), allowing the Movingstyle to be freestanding, plus the podium is on wheels allowing you to easily move it from room to room.\n\nThe screen connects to, and locks in to the stand in a reassuringly secure manner, and it\u2019s also easy to remove by sliding a switch on the rear of the screen to release it.\n\nWhen mounted on the podium stand, the Movingstyle can be rotated from landscape to portrait, making it ideal for scrolling social.\n\nOn the back of the screen there are a couple of USB-C ports (one of which can be used for charging or a permanent power connection), plus a HDMI input, allowing you to connect the display to set-top boxes, games consoles and other peripherals.\n\nAnd on the top edge you\u2019ll find a power button and a microphone mute switch, for when you don\u2019t want the built-in AI assistant listening out for you.\n\nThe Samsung Movingstyle is certainly a curious device. In a world where many of us have a smartphone, multiple TVs inhabit homes, plus a smattering of laptops and tablets can be found in family units, I wonder if consumers are actually calling for a screen like this.\n\nSamsung clearly believes there\u2019s demand, and in large enough quantities to actually bring the Movingstyle to market.\n\nSo while I\u2019m a little confused about why it exists and how it fits into people\u2019s already screen-heavy lifestyles, there\u2019s part of me which really digs it and would love to have one to scoot round my home.\n\nThere\u2019s currently no word on pricing or availability for the Movingstyle, but I\u2019ve requested more information from Samsung and will update this article if I hear back.",

      "text": "- Game at home or on the go\n- Sharp display\n- Unique multi-mode controller\n- Excellent game library\n- Great battery life\n- Limited internal storage\n- Some controller options are uncomfortable\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nThis review was last updated by Digital Trends\u2019 contributor Cody Perez on 5/11/2020.\nNintendo wants to win you back. Following the failure of its last home console, the Wii U, the publisher of Mario and Zelda announced very quickly that it was hard at work on a new console. Though the legendary publisher made some amazing games in the meantime \u2014 such as Super Mario Maker and Splatoon \u2014 it felt like Nintendo was holding back, and fans accepted that because they knew a new era was on the horizon. Going into our Nintendo Switch review, the question was, \u201ccan Nintendo turn things around with new hardware?\u201d The answer is a resounding \u201cyes.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s in the box\nThe Switch is a \u201chybrid\u201d game console. It\u2019s designed to plug into a TV just like a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, or it can be carried around as a portable device, similar to the Nintendo 3DS, or Game Boy.\nThe Switch itself is a small tablet with a 6.2\u201d LCD multi-touch display. Inside, the console has a custom Nvidia Tegra processor and 32GB of internal storage. It also has what you\u2019d expect in a portable device: an accelerometer, gyroscope, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC, Wi-Fi, and Wireless LAN capability (IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac).\nOn the outside, it has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, stereo speakers, power and volume buttons, ports for game cartridges, a MicroSD slot for expandable storage, a USB Type-C port for charging, and a kickstand.\nIt also comes with a dock, a cradle that the Switch slides into when you want to charge it or play it on a TV. The dock is effectively a hollow plastic hub that connects via the console\u2019s USB Type-C port. It has three ports on the back \u2014 USB Type-C for charging, HDMI for audio and video output, and a USB 2.0 port. There are also two additional USB 2.0 ports on the side. The rear ports are exposed via a simple door in the back, which also hides some cords.\nThe Switch is a perfect reflection of Nintendo\u2019s own gaming sensibilities.\nAlso included are two detachable controllers called \u201cJoy-Cons,\u201d which have all the controller buttons and slide onto the tablet, two Joy-Con straps, and the Joy-Con Grip, which fuses two Joy-Cons together as a single controller.\n(They\u2019re fairly versatile. Here\u2019s how to connect them to your PC, for example, or make art on a Surface Pro.)\nBattery life and portability\nThe original Switch has a battery life of 2.5 to 6 hours, and its lifespan is dependent on how demanding the game you\u2019re playing is. A game like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, for instance, leans heavier on the console\u2019s resources so the battery will last about 3 hours, even less if you\u2019re playing at full brightness. All this to say, it won\u2019t last through most flights, but it\u2019s fine for the commute to work.\nFor a system that touts portability, this is disappointing. While both the Nintendo 3DS and the PS Vita last between three to five hours, Nintendo could\u2019ve easily used the original Switch as an opportunity to improve on the standard.\nLuckily, a new version of the Switch with improved battery life arrived in 2019. The updated console, which has a new chip layout and a revised Tegra X1 processor, drastically improves on the original Switch\u2019s battery performance, offering 4.5 to nine hours of battery life. That\u2019s two precious hours of playtime added to your Breath of the Wild gaming session. This change to one of the Switch\u2019s biggest flaws takes the console to new heights, especially for players who frequently game on the go.\nSpeaking of gaming on the go, while the Switch is not quite as portable as the 3DS, the Switch Lite delivers on its promise of a handheld-focused system. Bringing a smaller, lighter, and more compact build to the family, the Switch Lite aims to satisfy players who prefer the handheld gaming lifestyle. It features the same revised chip layout and Tegra X1 processor in the updated Switch, and promises a battery life of up to seven hours. Released on September 20, 2019, it adds the missing portability that the hybrid version of the console lacks.\nPlay your way\nThough the Switch is a small tablet, it wears its soul outside of its small casing. The Joy-Cons can be used to control games in many different ways. The small, remote-style controllers slide and snap into place on either side of the Switch, turning it into a handheld gaming device \u00e1 la Nintendo\u2019s Game Boy and 3DS systems.\nBoth the console and Joy-Cons feel sturdy and have a solid, \u201cpremium\u201d build.\nSliding the Joy-Cons on and off may be one of the best physical design features of any game hardware in modern memory. It is easy, fun, and there\u2019s a nice click that you can both feel and hear when the Joy-Cons are in place. It\u2019s a seamless transition to make, even in the middle of a game.\nThe Switch feels good in hands. Both the console and Joy-Cons feel sturdy and have a solid, premium build. The Joy-Con\u2019s matte finish makes the console look and feel modern, whether you buy the gray or colorful red and blue version. At 398 grams (0.9 pounds) with the Joy-Cons attached, it is light enough to hold for long stretches in portable mode.\nThough the dock doesn\u2019t feel as sturdy or well-constructed as the console itself, it gets the job done. Though only the USB-C port holds it in place, the Switch seems secure in the dock, and we never experienced connectivity issues between the console and dock. It can be tricky to connect the Switch console to the USB-C port in the bottom of the dock on the first try, and it could use the same \u201cclick\u201d of recognition you get from the Joy-Cons to let you know that the console is secure, but it does a good job nonetheless.\nWhen the console is connected to its dock, or if you simply don\u2019t feel like holding the whole console, you can use Joy-Cons freely or slot them into Joy-Con Grip, which turns them into a conventional controller. The Grip works like any other gamepad, but it\u2019s much smaller than the PS4\u2019s Dualshock 4 or the Xbox One controller. That can cause discomfort for most adults. The Joy-Con\u2019s small control sticks aren\u2019t as large as usual, either, so they can seem hard to grip. The optional Pro Controller fixes this problem \u2014 and is a great gamepad all-around \u2014 but it\u2019s a $70 accessory.\nA multiplayer machine, even on the go\nHaving two Joy-Cons opens the door for self-contained local multiplayer experiences. Some games allow players to each use a single Joy-Con as a controller. The Joy-Cons also have all the motion sensors necessary for gesture-based, motion-controlled games, similar to the Nintendo Wii.\nHowever, using the individual Joy-Cons as mini-controllers for local multiplayer can be downright uncomfortable. The controllers are very small and, when turned horizontally, have a rounded rectangular shape. Holding onto them can become painful after sustained and/or intense play sessions.\nThe console\u2019s included \u201cJoy-Con straps\u201d add more comfortable shoulder buttons and, of course, a wrist strap, to each Joy-Con \u2013 but they only slightly improve comfort. The Joy-Cons aren\u2019t identical, either. The analog stick and buttons are in different positions on the left and right Joy-Cons.\nThe analog on the right Joy-Con is basically in the center of the controller, which makes it difficult to get a grip on the stick. The player with the left Joy-Con definitely has an advantage if a game uses the thumbstick. If you need a controller in a pinch, it might be a better option to use a spare GameCube controller \u2014 and thanks to an update, they\u2019re compatible.\nThere is one poorly built element of the Switch: its kickstand. It is a flimsy flap of plastic that flips out of console\u2019s back panel and keeps the console upright for on-the-go multi-player matches \u2013 or if you\u2019re tired and don\u2019t want to hold the console. The console will stay upright so long as it isn\u2019t touched or jostled, but after opening it even one time you will be afraid that it could break. That would be especially bad, because the kickstand doubles as a protective covering for the MicroSD slot.\nA toy chest of peripherals\nThere is a slew of third-party peripherals that were made to compliment all the little issues with playing the Switch in its wide range of use-cases. Not only do these \u201coptional\u201d items greatly inflate the cost of the Switch, but they bring to light that the cost of the Switch\u2019s jack-of-all-trades approach to hardware design has created a console with acceptable, but annoying flaws.\nFor example, the console\u2019s 32GB of internal storage can store plenty of screenshots, short video clips (for a small number of first-party games) and probably more than a few small indie games, but players accustomed to buying games digitally will need a large MicroSDXC card for additional storage.\nIf you travel often and for long stretches, you will need an extra battery pack, similar to the kind people carry around to charge their phone. Third-party accessory makers have even begun creating portable docks and battery packs built specifically for the Switch, such as the SwitchCharge, which replace the console\u2019s flimsy stand.\nIf you play competitive games, or play for long stretches at a time, you want to shell out for Nintendo\u2019s Pro Controller, which costs an additional $70.\nStill, not all of the peripherals were created to address the system\u2019s shortcomings. Nintendo Labo, which launched about a year after the Switch itself, allows younger players to combine the Switch and its Joy-Con controllers with cardboard kits to create entirely new experiences. These include everything from playable pianos to RC cars and even a fishing rod, each of which make use of the system\u2019s infrared cameras and rumble to do unexpected things. Support for VR have even come to existing games, including Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, giving fans a novel new way to race.\nAll about the games\nNintendo\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel with some past home consoles was a lack of software support. The Wii U had trouble releasing games on a consistent basis over its short lifespan, and the Wii had trouble attracting third-party developers.\nWith the Switch though, that hasn\u2019t proven an issue. From Zelda to Mario to Pokemon, the Switch has enjoyed a barrage of excellent games that can appeal to both long-time Nintendo fans and newcomers.\nBetter still, the Switch has become the go-to platform for remasters, remakes, and reissues of older games. It can play the original Doom and, soon, its sequel, Doom Eternal. It can play Overwatch. It can play the original Final Fantasy VII. It can play a variety of emulated NES and SNES games through the Nintendo Switch Online service. Even The Witcher 3 is available. There\u2019s a huge depth of content for a variety of gamers.\nBetter online, mostly\nNintendo hasn\u2019t been at the forefront of online gaming innovation over the years, but the Switch offers a relatively stable multiplayer experience in everything from Arms to Splatoon 2. Some games, like Mario Kart 8, work fantastically well online.\nStill, limited matchmaking options in some of the biggest games, as well as the bizarre decision to omit voice chat without a smartphone app for some games, are baffling, and they pale in comparison to the quality-of-life options available on both PlayStation Network and Xbox Live. That said, some games, like Fortnite and Paladins, do allow for native voice chat through the Switch itself.\nNintendo has also, unfortunately, used its online service as a barrier for online play and its popular Virtual Console system. While a paid subscription for online access is a common practice among current-gen consoles, restricting access to some of Nintendo\u2019s most beloved retro games is unfair. Rather than allow you to buy classics to own as we\u2019ve seen on previous Nintendo consoles, you\u2019re given a selection of NES and SNES titles as part of your subscription. That is a fine option, but making it the only option feels like a mistake.\nThat being said, Nintendo has shown a surprising willingness to work with other platforms in some of its online games. If you want to play Minecraft or Fortnite on Switch with your friends on Xbox or PC, you can, and in the former game\u2019s case, you can even earn Xbox achievements.\nNo Netflix here, yet\nDespite its multitude of play-styles and parts, the Switch is actually a straightforward gaming machine. Unlike other consoles, which aspire to become all-in-one living room or mobile online entertainment devices, the Switch is dedicated to gaming and gaming alone (at least for now).\nThe user interface is very simple \u2014 a series of large squares, which shows your available games. There\u2019s a second set of smaller round buttons below the games with a Nintendo-curated blog feed, the eShop, a place to view and share screenshots, etc.\nThere are few non-gaming apps available right now \u2014 Hulu is the only current major streaming service \u2014 and Nintendo hasn\u2019t said when or if those features will make their way to the console. Like the camera, their omission doesn\u2019t feel like a huge loss, but they would be welcome.\nMost players already have a large number of devices \u2014 phone, tablet, laptop \u2014 on which to watch Netflix and Disney+. At the same time, with its sharp screen and third-party stand, the Switch would make a good personal viewing screen.\nMaybe Link can save our world, too\nYou probably don\u2019t think about the power a game console uses, but it can be substantial. An Xbox One X can suck down more juice than a small refrigerator while gaming. That damages our planet and, over time, can add a hidden cost to your power bill.\nNintendo\u2019s portable Switch sidesteps the issue. It draws about 12 watts while gaming in docked mode. The Switch\u2019s total power draw is even less when other factors, like standby use and data center use, are considered. PlayStation and Xbox consoles frequently download large patches and can be used to stream content from power-hungry data centers.\nThat all adds up. A study by the Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory found the Switch uses less than a 10th as much power as the PlayStation 4 Pro when all sources of energy use are considered. It\u2019s far less demanding than the Xbox One S or Xbox One X, as well.\nThe Switch can also save your wallet. A light gamer will spend $47 less on their utility bill if they buy the Switch instead of a PlayStation 4 Pro. A gamer who frequently spends all day gaming could save up to $180. That\u2019s enough to buy three new, full-priced games.\nNintendo also offers free recycling for your old console and peripherals through its Take Back program. Microsoft and Sony offer similar programs, but they\u2019re more difficult to find on each company\u2019s website.\nWarranty information\nThe Nintendo Switch comes with a one-year limited warranty from the manufacturer.\nOur Take\nThe Switch manages to blend Nintendo\u2019s penchant for weird, gimmicky hardware with the high-quality design we\u2019ve come to expect of consoles in the modern era. From a hardware perspective, it is the best console from the company in generations \u2014 possibly ever.\nStill, the Switch is a Nintendo machine made for playing Nintendo games. Despite all the measures taken to make it feel more \u201cmainstream,\u201d its flaws reveal that the console was designed so that Nintendo\u2019s developers could make interesting games. If you love Nintendo, this bodes well, as the big N seems to be hitting a new stride.\nIs there a better alternative?\nThe Switch is unique. There are no platforms that offer the same home/portable hybrid functionality, or such a wide range of controller options. Also, many of its best franchises, such as Splatoon and Mario, will not be playable on any other platform, Nintendo or otherwise.\nIf you can do without Nintendo games and play on a TV or monitor, you would be better served purchasing a PS4, Xbox One, or gaming PC. If you already have any of these, the Switch is a fantastic second system that will give you access to more original games than any other option.\nIf you\u2019re specifically looking for a portable platform, we would recommend the Switch over the 3DS. With improved battery life and an extensive collection of games available on the Switch, you would only be limiting your options by entertaining an inferior handheld that is at the end of its lifecycle.\nHow long will it last?\nHistorically, successful game consoles have a shelf-life of about five years before the manufacturer makes a new console. We should also note that console makers have been working to shorten the lifecycle of systems, even when the hardware is successful. This is the case with the Switch.\nTwo years following its initial release, Nintendo launched an upgraded version of the console with improved battery life. The Switch Lite, a compact version of the Switch made exclusively for handheld play, arrived shortly after. Original Switch owners that aren\u2019t interested in a more handheld-friendly console will likely pass on the Switch Lite, but the revised version of the Switch will is a permanent replacement for the original that significantly improves battery life, which was a bit short on the debut version.\nShould you buy it?\nYes. If you love Nintendo and want to keep playing new Nintendo games, or already own a modern game console, then the Switch should be your next game console. The best thing is that now that we\u2019re close to Black Friday you can get it at a lower price thanks to the Nintendo Switch deals. However, if this is your first modern console, or if you mostly like to play a lot of games online, you should pass.\nThis review was last updated by Digital Trends contributor Cody Perez on 5/08/2020."

But on top of that, there\u2019s also a layer of quantum dots built into the A95L, which does wonders for overall color and peak brightness level, not to mention the supremely wide color gamut you\u2019ll get to experience.\nIt\u2019s not too often we get to rave about a TV\u2019s audio system, but we couldn\u2019t believe the type of sound quality the A95L is capable of. With such bold performance and brilliant soundstaging, you\u2019d think you were using a great soundbar or surround sound-lite, but nope: it\u2019s all in the TV speakers, friends.\nPicture-wise, the list of terrific things to say is nearly endless, but highlights include some of the best color purity and saturation levels we\u2019ve ever seen; or at least one with these nit numbers. The A95L also delivers some tremendous 4K upscaling, which not only brings lower-res content closer to Ultra HD quality, but also reduces picture noise and other artifacts to give you final frames that clean and sharp look. The A95L is also a fantastic TV for gaming, especially for those who own a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S.\nPrice-wise, this is going to be one of the most expensive picks on our list, but we really can\u2019t praise the Sony A95L enough. And if you're on the lookout for a super-great deal on one of last year's flagship sets, now is the time to track down a Sony A95K.\nBest budget TV\nHisense U7N\n- High brightness\n- Great contrast\n- Vivid color\n- Surprising accuracy\n- Great for gaming\n- Poor off-angle viewing\n- Risk of dirty screen effect\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen sizes available | 55, 65, 75, 85 inches |\n| TV type | mini-LED |\n| HDR support | HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision |\n| Operating system | Google TV |\n| Connectivity | 2 x HDMI 2.1, 2 x HDMI 2.0, USB-A, optical, Ethernet |\nIf you can\u2019t reasonably afford the $1,000-plus splurge that the Hisense U8N requires, you can still own an amazing Hisense by going with the U7N Series. The U7N delivers similar performance peaks as the U8N and uses a similar mini-LED lighting system. However, the U8N is the better choice for overall brightness, colors, and contrast, as well as reflection handling. Our TV expert Caleb Denison also flagged this set for lackluster off-angle viewing and the occasional dirty screen effect.\nThis isn\u2019t to say you won\u2019t be blown away by the type of picture the U7N brings to the table. On top of class-leading HDR support, the U7N has excellent gaming features, including an automatic Game Mode for reduced input lag and increased response time and 4K/144Hz (or 1080p/240Hz) support across the TV\u2019s four HDMI 2.1 ports. Google TV OS takes care of the user menus and onboard streaming capabilities, and the remote comes with a Google Assistant button for content searches and smart home controls.\nWith 55-, 65-, 75-, and 85-inch size options available, the Hisense U7N is one of the best middle-of-the-road sets we\u2019ve tested in recent years, and it\u2019s one of the best TVs you can buy for less than $1,000. We\u2019re also curious to see what a couple of software updates might do for the TV\u2019s overall performance, though we\u2019re pretty sure brightness, colors, and contrast will remain untouched.\nThe best TV runner-up\nPanasonic Z95A\n- Incredibly good sound\n- Great upscaling and motion resolution\n- Excellent HDR performance\n- Gorgeous, accurate color\n- Competitive price\n- Fire TV Auto-plays ads by default\n- Paused content restarts after 5 minutes\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen sizes available | 55, 65 inches |\n| TV type | OLED |\n| HDR support | HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, HLG |\n| Operating system | Fire TV |\n| Connectivity | 2x HDMI 2.1, 2 x HDMI 2.0, USB-A, optical |\nWe are super excited about Panasonic's return to the United States TV market, and the Z95A is a great example of why. This is a top-tier TV designed to go head-to-head with the best from LG, Samsung, and Sony, and it really delivers. In fact, our expert TV reviewer Caleb Denison touted it thusly: \"The brightness punch, contrast, color richness, color saturation, motion resolution, and upscaling are all top-tier,\" he said in his review. \"As a top-five TV, it stands right up there with the Samsung S95D, LG G4, Sony A95L, and the Sony Bravia 9.\" High praise.\nUsing a similar OLED panel to the LG G4, with all the brightness enhancements delivered by Micro-Lens Array (MLA) technology, this TV is bright, bold, and has an incredibly crisp picture. It has that infinite contrast that defines OLED TVs, all while pushing the brightness and clarity higher than ever.\nWhile it does lack the quantum dot enhancement of QD-OLED TVs, like the S95D and A95L, its contrast appears to be slightly better to most viewers. It also has one of the best upscaling processors we've ever seen, making older and lower-resolution content look stunning. It also has impressive built-in audio, and though it won't compete with an upgraded AV setup, it's perfectly workable while you make your decisions over soundbar vs. surround sound.\nThis TV has Amazon's Fire TV built in, giving you all the top streaming channels right from the get go. It's not often as lauded as alternatives such as Roku, Apple TV, and Google TV, but it's perfectly capable and you can always switch out to an external streaming device if you have a preference. For buyers with an extensive Alexa smart home setup, though, you'll find this TV a bit easier to integrate.\nThe Panasonic Z95A is an excellent welcome return to form for the storied TV brand.\nThe best LG OLED TV\nLG OLED Evo G4\n- Outstanding brightness\n- Astounding accuracy\n- Unprecedented flexibility\n- Awesome gaming performance\n- Five-year warranty\n- Hit-or-miss sound\n- Frustrating remote\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen sizes available | 55, 65, 77, 83, 97 inches |\n| TV type | OLED |\n| HDR support | HDR10, Dolby Vision, HLG |\n| Operating system | LG webOS 24 |\n| Connectivity | 4 x HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, USB-A |\nUntil we get the next-generation G5, the LG G4 is still the king of LG's hill, and it's still one of the best TVs you can buy. Period.\nIn our LG G4 video review, Denison not only says that \"the LG G4 has the best picture quality I've ever tested in a TV,\" but that \"it's the brightest TV we've tested to date.\" This is some high praise, but he does add that getting it there takes a little bit of work in the picture settings. In the end, it has some excellent versatility \u2014 it can be the brightest it can be if you're going to use it in a bright room, or it can be dialed down if your viewing setting is a man cave or light-controlled home theater room, for example. The choice is yours.\nThere\u2019s been plenty of fanfare about Samsung and Sony\u2019s forays into QD-OLED tech, which has enjoyed the reputation of being brighter than OLED. We're big fans of QLED and QD-OLED panels, but now LG is forcing its two fiercest competitors to take heed. We\u2019re also pleased to see LG\u2019s latest chip, the a11 AI processor, put to the test. The speedy new chip brings improved processing speed, unparalleled picture upscaling, lag-free streaming, and big audio performance to LG's flagship lineup.\nThe best Samsung TV for bright rooms\nSamsung S95D OLED TV\n- Exellent brightness\n- Eye-popping color\n- Snappy operation\n- Great gaming features\n- Awesome for bright rooms\n- Anti-glare treatment is polarizing\n- Blacks may appear lifted in bright rooms\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen sizes available | 66, 65, 77 inches |\n| TV type | QD-OLED |\n| HDR support | HDR10, HDR10+, HLG |\n| Operating system | Samsung Tizen |\n| Connectivity | 4 x HDMI 2.1, 3 x USB-A, USB-C, Ethernet |\nThe Samsung S95D is further proof that one of the biggest names in TVs shows no signs of stopping. The S95D QD-OLED delivers impressive brightness levels on-par with some of the better-performing LED sets on the market. Another OLED TVs struggle in sunny rooms, but the S95D's anti-glare screen holds its own, making it a great choice for spaces for even brightly lit rooms. Then there's the flip side of this awesome coin: its OLED backbone. Thanks to millions of self-emissive pixels, on top of brilliant HDR capabilities, inky black levels and ultra-rich colors are just part of the norm for the S95D.\nThe S95D's marquee feature that has been dividing TV enthusiasts is its special anti-glare coating. We first saw it demoed at CES in early 2024, and it's cool tech that does a great job at drastically reducing glare, especially in bright rooms. However, it can ever-so-slightly reduce the picture's luster compared to traditional OLED TVs. In a completely dark room, you probably wouldn't notice the difference, but with some light in the room, a keen eye might pick up on it.\nThe Samsung S95D also surprised us a bit with how good it sounds. Usually, TVs have pretty weak built-in speakers. The S95D's has rear-firing speakers and eight bass transducers that deliver decent low-end rumble. It won't replace a dedicated soundbar, but for casual viewing, it gets the job done. Especially if you plan on mounting this TV on the wall, where the speaker design performs best.\nThe Samsung S95D is a strong contender for the title of best OLED TV, but we'd be remiss if we didn't also mention that it features Samsung's One Connect box that keeps your cables at bay. One of our only gripes is that it runs Samsung's Tizen operating system, which can be easily remedied by connecting your favorite streaming device instead. If you prioritize absolute picture perfection in a dark room over reflection control, you might want to consider other options. But for most viewers, the S95D is a winner.\nA great TCL alternative under $1,000\nTCL QM6K\n- Surprisingly good color accuracy\n- Excellent black levels\n- Vastly improved off-angle picture\n- Feature rich\n- Impressive clarity\n- Underwhelming sound\n- Lacks a little sparkle\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen sizes available | 50, 55, 65, 75, 85, 98 inches |\n| TV type | Mini LED |\n| HDR support | HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, Dolby Vision Gaming, Dolby Vision IQ |\n| Operating system | Google TV |\n| Connectivity | 2 x HDMI 2.1, 2 x HDMI 2.0, USB-A, Ethernet, optical |\nThe TCL QM6K is right out of the gate in 2025 as one of the best TVs you can buy for under $1,000. It offers some of the best color accuracy we've ever seen in a TV at this price, and though its brightness and contrast can't quite match the very top models, it punches well above its weight and has us very excited for the rest of the 2025 TCL TV lineup.\nThe HDR support is extensive, with not only both Dolby Digital and HDR10+ support, but a range of other advanced gaming and movie modes to make your favorite content look its absolute best. There's strong upscaling, a great array of ports for connecting games consoles, A/V systems and UHD Blu-ray players, and a fast and effective operating system that feels snappy and intuitive.\nOur own TV reviewer, Caleb Denison, said this of the TCL QM6K's impressive coloring: \"This is the most color-accurate TV of its price that I can recall testing. The color in SDR and HDR is outstanding. In fact, the skin tones on this TV are better than the now-$15,000 QM891G 115-inch monster TV \u2014 the color accuracy is just so dialed-in.\"\nPicture quality is top-notch on this affordable TV, making it one of the best options if you're looking for an update this year.\nThe best Hisense TV you can buy\nHisense U8N\n- Intense brightness\n- Deep blacks/contrast\n- Vibrant, accurate color\n- Great sound\n- Overly bright HDR\n- Poor off-angle viewing\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen sizes available | 55, 65, 75, 85 inches |\n| TV type | mini-LED |\n| HDR support | HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, HLG |\n| Operating system | Google TV |\n| Connectivity | 2 x HDMI 2.1, 2 x HDMI 2.0, USB-A, optical, Ethernet |\nIt\u2019s getting harder and harder for us to call Hisense a \u201cbudget-friendly\u201d brand. That kind of connotation just doesn\u2019t line up with the type of picture and sound performance you\u2019ll get from a Hisense set, especially if you\u2019ve got your sights set on one of its U8 offerings.\nOver the last couple of years, we\u2019ve had the continued opportunity to review several Hisense sets, including a handful of its flagship models. The Hisense U8N is the newest addition to the Hisense family, and we were simply blown away by the picture quality and medley of features this bad boy brings to the table.\nThe U8N is a powerful TV that delivers a brilliant and colorful image in both SDR and HDR viewing modes. When measuring nit output for these settings, our reviewer measured peak brightness at 1,300 nits in SDR, with around 3,500 for specular highlights in HDR. There\u2019s no doubting the fact that the U8N can get very bright, but it also delivers the kind of incredible contrast numbers that might fool some folks into thinking it\u2019s actually an OLED set.\nWhile it suffers a bit in the viewing angle department, if you can arrange your furniture appropriately, we have no doubt that the Hisense U8N is one of the best bright TVs on the market for 2025.\nThe best mini-LED you can buy\nSony Bravia 9\n- Super-clean picture\n- Deep blacks, minimal blooming\n- Excellent contrast\n- Searing HDR highlights\n- Excellent motion handling\n- Backlight fluctuations visible in dark rooms\n- Very expensive\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen sizes available | 65, 75, 85 inches |\n| TV type | mini-LED |\n| HDR support | HDR10, Dolby Vision, HLG |\n| Operating system | Google TV |\n| Connectivity | 2 x HDMI 2.1, 2 x HDMI 2.0, optical, Ethernet |\nThe Sony Bravia 9 is one of the best TVs we\u2019ve ever tested, bar-none; and quite frankly, we were expecting it to be amazing. This is because Sony has basically conditioned us to expect big things when a new premium TV hits shelves. In the case of the Bravia 9, Sony developed a new IC chip that allows the TV\u2019s mini-LED lighting to be meticulously controlled, leading to some of the most accurate colors, contrast, and brightness levels we\u2019ve ever seen from an LED-LCD.\nIn terms of overall picture quality, our own editor-at-large Caleb Denison thought the Bravia 9 actually did a nice job at striking the balance between a great mini-LED LCD TV and an OLED TV. That being said, because it\u2019s an LCD set, the Bravia 9 performs best in brightly lit rooms and is a champ when it comes to reflection handling. From 4K movies and shows to next-gen gaming, your favorite content gets a solid boost in quality, thanks to Sony\u2019s advanced picture processing and a full suite of HDMI 2.1 ports, which bodes particularly well for gamers who want a TV that delivers fast response time and excellent motion clarity.\nOne of the best ways to maximize the picture of the Bravia 9 is watching or playing HDR titles. Thanks to Dolby Vision support and compatibility with other leading HDR codecs, the Bravia 9 pushes deep blacks and bright highlights in a way we\u2019ve never seen on an LCD set. Other noteworthy features include a pulse-pounding 70-watt, 2.2.2 audio system, Google TV for apps and streaming content, and VRR support for optimizing your next round of Call of Duty.\nWhile we do wish the off-angle viewing and gray uniformity were a bit better, we\u2019re thrilled to see the kind of precise engineering that went into the development of this TV and we're super excited to see what comes next.\nThe best midrange Sony TV\nSony Bravia 7\n- Bright and vivid\n- Excellent black levels/contrast\n- Extremely accurate HDR/Color\n- Top-tier motion/upscaling\n- Easy to use\n- Limited viewing angle\n- Poor reflection handling\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen sizes available | 55, 65, 75, 85 inches |\n| TV type | mini-LED |\n| HDR support | HDR10, Dolby Vision, HLG |\n| Operating system | Google TV |\n| Connectivity | 2 x HDMI 2.1, 2 x HDMI 2.0, USB-A, optical, Ethernet |\nWe\u2019ve sung the praises of the Sony Bravia 9 mini-LED, a premium TV for the ages that delivers a brilliant picture, complete with top-notch upscaling, terrific colors and contrast, and impeccable motion clarity. While Sony\u2019s Bravia 7 Series sits a couple of rungs below the flagship Bravia 9, we\u2019re still big fans of this midrange option. Do keep in mind we\u2019re not talking about the best LED set Sony has, so there\u2019s definitely an issue or two that we\u2019d like to get squared away.\nFirst and foremost, this isn\u2019t an excellent TV for off-angle viewing. If you happen to be placing it in a living room or media space where seating is spread around the entire room, guests sitting at the farthest ends (totally off-center with the TV screen) will see a less vibrant and colorful picture than those sitting closer to the screen's center. We\u2019re also not the biggest fans of the Bravia 7\u2019s reflection handling, so this may not be the best TV for a brightly lit room. These grievances aside, our own TV expert Caleb Denison was impressed by how good this TV can look under optimal viewing conditions.\nExpect incredible brightness levels, terrific colors and contrast, reliable image upscaling, and must-have gaming features like 4K/120Hz (on two HDMI ports), next to no input lag, and lightning-fast response times. The Bravia 7 is also loaded with Google TV version 12 for all things Netflix, AirPlay, and smart home.\nAnd if you\u2019re thinking you may want to spend more to get into the Bravia 8 Series, do keep in mind that the latter is actually an OLED TV. Is there a big difference between QLED versus OLED TVs? Our thoughtful comparison should settle the score.\nThe best LG OLED for most people\nLG C4 evo OLED\n- Excellent contrast\n- Rich color\n- Very good upscaling\n- Great for gaming\n- Accurate out-of-the-box settings\n- Weak audio system\n- Slight green tinge off-angle\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen sizes available | 42, 48, 55, 65, 77, 83 inches |\n| TV type | OLED |\n| HDR support | HDR10, Dolby Vision, HLG |\n| Operating system | LG webOS |\n| Connectivity | 4 x HDMI 2.1, 3 x USB-A, Ethernet, optical |\nLet\u2019s not beat around the bush: The LG C4 OLED is one of the best TVs that LG has ever made, and we think most folks will agree. Sitting just one rung below the flagship LG G4 Series, the C4 is equipped with LG\u2019s all-new a9 AI Processor Gen 7 that delivers some of the best picture processing and 4K upscaling we\u2019ve ever seen from an OLED. And unlike its direct predecessor, the C3 Series, the C4 now includes Filmmaker Mode, giving you the kind of picture that a movie or show\u2019s creative team intended for you to see.\nEach of the C4\u2019s HDMI 2.1 ports are fine-tuned for both console and PC gaming, so expect lightning-fast response times and low input lag. And because the C4 can handle up to a 144Hz refresh rate, feel free to use this bad boy as a big PC gaming monitor \u2014 it's an excellent gaming TV. We\u2019re glad to see that LG has only improved when it comes to HDR and SDR brightness, colors, and contrast.\nWe\u2019re also glad to see another example of a TV company giving a little more consideration to its speakers. Not only is the C4 equipped with a 40-watt 2.2 speaker configuration, but thanks to the new A9 AI Sound Pro feature, your favorite movies, shows, games, and music can be up-mixed to 9.1.2 surround sound.\nIn years past, we\u2019ve talked about how LG\u2019s webOS streaming hub can be a little overwhelming; at least as far as layout and ad drops go. And while these interface elements could still use some love, we think webOS 24 runs smoother than ever before.\nThe best TCL TV\nTCL QM8 Series (2024)\n- Exceptional brightness levels\n- Great colors and contrast\n- Solid gaming optimizations\n- Google TV OS is fast and packed with apps\n- Not the best off-angle viewing\n- Colors will require some fine-tuning\n| Specification: | |\n| Screen sizes available | 65, 75, 85, 98 inches |\n| TV type | mini-LED |\n| HDR support | HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, HLG |\n| Operating system | Google TV |\n| Connectivity | 2 x HDMI 2.1, 2 x HDMI 2.0, USB-A, Ethernet, optical, 3.5mm |\nTCL has been a consistent achiever in the TV world, especially over the last couple of years. As a matter of fact, our own TV expert Caleb Denison gave considerable praise to the previous year\u2019s TCL flagship QM8 Series, a mini-LED-driven QLED set with top-shelf brightness, colors, contrast, and motion clarity. In 2024, the new and improved QM8 brought a few meaningful changes to the table, namely enhanced brightness and a more advanced picture engine. TCL claims the new QM8 delivers double the illumination of its predecessor, with some sizes offering up to 5,000 local dimming zones.\nMovie enthusiasts and gamers will love the new QM8\u2019s picture processing and console optimizations. Each of the four HDMI ports is 2.1 certified, making this an excellent TV for lag reduction and fast response times. You\u2019ll even be able to game at up to 4K/144Hz or 1080p/240Hz, though only one of the HDMI ports can do so. With support for leading HDR formats like Dolby Vision and HDR10+, the newest QM8 delivers vibrant highlights and solid black levels during dark scenes.\nAs for all things apps and games, the new QM8 returns to Google TV OS. This fast and intuitive platform gives you access to hundreds of streaming apps, free live TV, AirPlay capabilities, and smart home controls via Google Assistant.\nAvailable in 65, 75, 85, and 98-inch sizes, the latest and greatest TCL QM8 Series is further proof that this fan-favorite TV maker shows no signs of stopping.\nIf the 65-inch model is the right size for you, definitely check out the deal at Walmart that will save you $450.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThe answer to that depends on many factors, including your stylistic preferences, the size of the room, and how far away you'll be sitting. Take a look at our guide to choosing the perfect TV size for you.\nIf you want to enjoy your TV from a variety of viewing positions, you'll need a TV with wide viewing angles. Of the two main LCD panel types (IPS and VA), IPS panels offer the greatest viewing angles. However, this can sometimes come at the cost of worse contrast. OLED TVs offer both excellent contrast and viewing angles, compared to their QLED counterparts, which are best watched from the center position.\nQLED stands for quantum dot LED TV, and it uses a layer of tiny particles to enhance an LED TV's color accuracy without diminishing brightness. QLED TVs still don't deliver the perfect blacks of OLED TVs, but the newest ones come very, very close. Because QLED TVs often have powerful backlights that use hundred (or in the case of mini-LED, thousands) of LEDs, they can get brighter than the brightest OLED TVs.\nYou may want to check out our article that covers QLED vs. OLED TV: What\u2019s the difference, and why does it matter?\nOLED stands for organic light-emitting diode, and these TVs are notable for their ability to produce perfect blacks and what is sometimes referred to as \"infinite\" contrast. These TVs achieve this through their ability to completely shut down the light they emit on a pixel-by-pixel basis, something QLED TVs can't do because they rely on a separate backlight to create brightness. You can block a lot of the light produced by a backlight, but not 100%.\nThese are the best Roku TVs. Roku has also started manufacturing its own \"Roku-made\" TVs, which are on store shelves now.\nThat depends on the TV, but as a general rule of thumb, the better (and more expensive) the TV, the better the upscaling.\nAlmost all new TVs are 4K, so there are plenty of fantastic options to choose from at the lower end of the pricing scale. Don't expect a standard LED TV to rival an OLED or QLED, though \u2014 set your expectations accordingly. We recommend looking for a quantum dot LED TV (QLED) model, as these will offer the best picture quality at lower prices.\nYes, so long as your computer has an HDMI output. Adapters can be used for other output types but frequently do not pass along audio.\nMost modern TVs can be paired with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant through either an Amazon Echo, Fire TV, or Google Home device. Some televisions even have them built-in, eliminating the need for a smart speaker.\nRight now, there are no TVs that have Siri built-in. Those that support AirPlay 2 and HomeKit, however, can be controlled using Siri on an iOS device, such as an iPad, iPhone, HomePod, or HomePod Mini, as well as a Mac.\nOLED TVs are the only type of 4K TVs that have the potential to suffer from burn-in, though it's incredibly uncommon. Unless you like to leave the same news channel playing for eight hours a day, seven days a week for weeks on end, you probably don't need to worry about it.\nTVs are a big priority for us at Digital Trends, and our resident TV expert, Caleb Denison, puts all the best TVs from every TV manufacturer through their paces. Check out our detailed rundown of how we test TVs in our reviews.\nGlossary of terms\nHere\u2019s a rundown of some of the most common terms associated with today\u2019s TV technology.\n4K Ultra HD\nThis refers to a display resolution that is four times that of 1080p HD. A 4K Ultra HD TV\u2019s pixel resolution is a 3,840 x 2,160 grid in a 16:9 aspect ratio, resulting in nearly 8.3 million pixels. This increase in density adds striking detail and realism to an image and allows larger screens to be viewed from closer distances without individual pixels becoming visible.\nHigh dynamic range (HDR)\nHigh dynamic range is probably most familiar to people through the HDR mode on their digital cameras. It\u2019s designed to deliver a picture that has greater details in the shadows and highlights, plus a wider range of colors. HDR in televisions pursues the same goal. The color palette is wider, blacks are deeper, and whites are brighter.\nPresently, there are two major HDR formats: HDR10 and Dolby Vision, with a third \u2014 HDR10+ \u2014 beginning to show up on new models, particularly those from Samsung. The first is the HDR standard, but Dolby Vision offers a premium experience. Consider a TV that supports both. HLG (hybrid log gamma) is another recent addition to the HDR collection, which supports over-the-air (OTA) broadcast content with HDR.\nFull-array local dimming (FALD)\nThis refers to an LED TV\u2019s backlighting system. A FALD display contains an array of LEDs spread out in a grid behind an LCD panel, rather than just at the edges of the TV. This LED array is broken up into zones that can be dimmed when necessary to achieve better black levels. Another benefit is more uniform brightness across the screen.\nWide color gamut (WCG)\nThese are the expanded color reproduction abilities of a 4K Ultra HD TV, which are closer than ever to what we see in a digital cinema. By approaching (or sometimes exceeding) the Digital Cinema Initiative\u2019s (DCI) P3 color specification, a 4K UHD TV can produce billions of more colors than a 1080p HD TV.\nQuantum dots\nA layer of film loaded with tiny nanocrystal semiconductors is placed in a TV\u2019s display panel to help produce a more accurate array of colors. Quantum dots work by producing a purer form of white light from a TV\u2019s backlighting system, which helps the TV\u2019s color filter perform more accurately.\nPhosphor-coated LED\nAn alternative to Quantum Dots, phosphor-coated LEDs have a chemical coating to alter the light\u2019s output. When used in a TV, this results in a purer backlight that\u2019s more easily manipulated by a TV\u2019s color filter, resulting in a wide color gamut and increased color accuracy.\nHDMI 2.1\nThe latest version of the HDMI spec. It offers new enhancements for video games like variable refresh rate (VRR) and automatic low-latency mode (ALLM) and the ability to pass 4K signals to the TV at up to 120Hz, for ultra-smooth motion. HDMI 2.1 is a requirement for 8K video sources like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. For most non-gamers, HDMI 2.1 is a nice way to future-proof yourself but it's nowhere near a necessity yet.\nHDCP 2.3\nThe latest version of the High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection technology, which provides copy prevention specifically of 4K Ultra HD and 8K content. Any source device that requires HDCP 2.3 will require a TV with an HDCP 2.3-compliant HDMI port for a compatible connection.\nHEVC (H.265)\nStands for \u201cHigh-Efficiency Video Coding.\u201d A compression technology developed to make large 4K UHD video files smaller and, therefore, easier to stream over broadband Internet connections. HEVC is said to double the data compression ratio over H.264, the predominant encoding technology used today for 1080p videos while retaining the same video quality. A smart TV or streaming set-top box must be able to decode HEVC to playback 4K Ultra HD video from sites like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.\nVP9\nAn alternative to HEVC developed by Google and used predominantly for encoding 4K Ultra HD YouTube videos. For a smart TV or streaming set-top box to play 4K Ultra HD YouTube videos, it must be able to decode VP9 videos."
