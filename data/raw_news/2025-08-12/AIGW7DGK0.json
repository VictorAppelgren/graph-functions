      "text": "Shopping for a gaming chair can be tricky: Many look alike and list the same features, but comfort and ergonomics are hard to judge without trying them. Today\u2019s chairs offer better support, breathable mesh and wider seats, making them great for gaming or office use. Whether buying for yourself or as a gift, there are options for every budget and body type. I test chairs with help from friends and family of various sizes -- I'm 6 feet tall and over 200 pounds, and some chairs feel snug, but a smaller person might find them uncomfortably large. Choosing one that matches your height and weight is crucial for optimal support. That's where I can help.\nOur Picks\nWhat's the best gaming chair overall?\nThe Secretlab Titan Evo is the best gaming chair I've tested. It combines traditional gaming style and feel with modern features like swappable skins, magnetic armrests, an optional footrest, a legrest and a wide range of designs -- all at a reasonable price. It comes in multiple sizes so that you can get an excellent fit regardless of size. That combination makes it the best overall.\nWhat we updated: June 2025\nAdded Anda Seat Kaiser 4, Sihoo Doro S300 and Anda Seat Novis Series chairs. Removed Anda Seat Fnatic Edition, Razer Iskur and Secret Labs Omega 2020.\nPros\n- Comes in three sizes\n- Adjustable built-in lumbar support\n- Locking 4D armrests\n- Multiple upholstery options and themed Skins for personalization\nCons\n- Firm seat\n- Footrest and legrest are sold separately\nWhy I like it\nThe Titan Evo builds on a top-rated design with smart, user-friendly upgrades. Its magnetic headrest and armrests simplify customization and maintenance, while the internal adjustable lumbar support and locking 4D armrests provide ergonomic comfort and stability. The wide seat, deep recline, and multiple upholstery options make it adaptable to different needs. It\u2019s also available in three sizes: small (up to 5 feet, 6 inches and 200 pounds), regular (5 feet, 7 inches to 6 feet 2 inches and up to 220 pounds) and XL (5 feet, 11 inches to 6 feet, 9 inches and up to 395 pounds). The new Secretlab Skins add another layer of personalization and protection.\nWho it\u2019s best for\nIt is ideal for gamers and remote workers who spend long hours at their desks and value comfort and customization. It's especially well-suited for people who want a high-end, adjustable chair that fits their body type -- thanks to three size options -- and those who appreciate aesthetic flexibility through themed skins.\nWho should skip it\nIt's not a great match for those who prefer a soft, plush seat or minimalist office chairs without gaming aesthetics. It may also be too expensive for budget-conscious buyers or overkill for those who only sit for short periods.\nPros\n- Extra-wide seat base is ideal for sitting cross-legged or with feet up\n- Fits a wide height-and-weight range\n- Choice of premium PVC leather or linen in multiple colors\n- Upgraded magnetic headrest for easy adjustment\n- 4D armrests with added tilt\nCons\n- Large footprint may not fit smaller spaces\n- Limited fabric options\n- Aside from an upward tilt, the armrests don't lock in place\nWhy I like it\nThe Kaiser 4 improves on AndaSeat's previous models with thoughtful design upgrades. It includes internal adjustable lumbar support, a magnetic headrest for easy height adjustment and 4D armrests that tilt upward, making it ideal for console or handheld gaming. The broad base, spacious seat and plush materials -- premium PVC leather or linen fabric -- add to its comfort. It\u2019s available in lots of colors and two sizes that support people up to 6-feet-11-inches tall and 397 pounds (the XL model, in particular, cradles you like a baseball in a mitt).\nWho it\u2019s best for\nIt's great for gamers who like to sit cross-legged or with their feet up and for people who spend long hours seated for work, play or lounging. It\u2019s especially suited for people who want a traditional gaming chair style with premium materials and ergonomic enhancements.\nWho should skip it\nIt's not ideal for those who prefer a minimalist or office-style aesthetic, or if you're looking for mesh-backed breathability. It\u2019s also not the best choice if you need compact dimensions for smaller spaces, as the chair\u2019s wide footprint may overwhelm tight setups.\nPros\n- Antigravity mechanism gives you a weightless feel\n- Breathable mesh helps keep you cool\n- Fully adjustable armrests for custom positioning\n- Ideal for handheld or controller gamers\nCons\n- Armrests don\u2019t lock into place\n- Less cushioned than traditional seats\n- Ratcheting backrest system doesn't lock\nWhy I like it\nThe Sihoo Doro S300 has excellent ergonomics for all-day comfort. Its standout feature is the 6D padded armrests, which can tilt inward and upward, perfect for console gaming or adjusting your posture throughout the day. The company used premium materials like aluminum alloy, breathable mesh and soft velvet, and the dual lumbar support, five-level adjustable backrest and an antigravity mechanism make you feel weightless when you recline. Add in a 30-day trial and a 5-year warranty, and this $679 chair clearly delivers both style and substance.\nWho it\u2019s best for\nThose who spend long hours at their desks: remote workers, gamers, or anyone needing a breathable yet supportive chair. It\u2019s especially great if you like a lot of adjustability, like console players or handheld gamers who benefit from the armrest tilt.\nWho should skip it\nI don't recommend it if you want locking armrests; the 6D arms can shift when getting in or out of the chair. The mesh seat means no plush cushioning or a more traditional executive-style seat. Also, at $679, it's not exactly a bargain, though you do get what you pay for.\nPros\n- Affordable price with a premium look and feel\n- Adjustable armrests suit various desk heights\n- Well-cushioned seat for long sitting sessions\n- Compact design fits most office or desk setups\nCons\n- Lacks advanced lumbar support (no pop-out feature)\n- Armrests don\u2019t rotate like higher-end models (e.g., Kaiser 4)\n- May not meet the needs of heavy or hardcore gamers\nWhy I like it\nThe AndaSeat Novis Series offers impressive quality at an affordable $250 price. It\u2019s easy to assemble (about 30 minutes, solo), fits most desk setups and features adjustable armrests that can clear standard desks even at their lowest setting. The seat is well-cushioned and supportive for long periods of use, with enough width to sit cross-legged comfortably, especially great for smaller users. Despite the budget price, the premium PVC leather finish gives it a high-end look and feel.\nWho it\u2019s best for\nIt's perfect for budget-conscious buyers who want a versatile, comfortable chair for gaming and office use. It\u2019s especially well-suited for petite users or those with smaller workspaces who still want adjustable features and lasting comfort. You don\u2019t need to be a gamer to enjoy it -- it\u2019s a great all-around ergonomic chair.\nWho should skip it\nHard-core gamers looking for advanced features like pop-out lumbar support or rotating armrests should give it a pass. It may feel too basic if you want highly customizable ergonomic adjustments or prefer a heavier-duty build (like what the Kaiser 4 on this list offers). Taller people may also want to double-check armrest and seat dimensions before committing.\nPros\n- Sleek, professional look\n- Mesh back for breathability and airflow\n- Highly adjustable for comfort and support\n- Full back support and headrest\n- Bold color accents offer subtle gaming flair\nCons\n- Premium price\n- Bold accents may still stand out in minimalist setups\n- Limited color combinations compared to typical gaming chairs\nWhy I like it\nThe Mavix M7 combines the comfort and adjustability of a high-end ergonomic office chair, but it still shows the company's gaming roots. It offers full back support, a breathable mesh back, 360-degree adjustable armrests and a bold, removable headrest and lumbar cushions. Its sleek design makes it one of the few gaming chairs that can blend seamlessly into a professional office. It\u2019s also one of the most comfortable and adjustable chairs I've tested.\nWho it\u2019s best for\nThis one is a solid choice for professionals or gamers who want the ergonomic benefits of an office chair and the comfort of a gaming chair, but without the flashy design. It\u2019s perfect for someone who spends long hours at a desk and values airflow, adjustability and understated aesthetics.\nWho should skip it\nAt nearly $800, the M7 is firmly in the \"premium\" category. It also won\u2019t satisfy those who prefer the traditional plush look and feel of racing-style gaming chairs with faux leather and bold colors throughout.\nPros\n- Exceptional back and shoulder support\n- Breathable, layered upholstery keeps you cool\n- 12-year warranty\nCons\n- Very expensive\n- \u201cGamer\u201d version differs mostly in color accents\n- Lacks traditional gaming chair aesthetic\nWhy I like it\nThe Embody Gaming Chair delivers top-tier ergonomic performance with exceptional back and shoulder support, ideal for long hours of work or gaming. Its standout feature is the dynamic tension adjustment system, allowing you to fine-tune support across a wide range of motion. The breathable \"pixelated support\" material keeps you cool while the build quality and comfort remain unmatched. Though branded for gamers, its design is subtle -- aside from optional ocean blue accents -- and it retains the same premium craftsmanship and 12-year warranty as the original office version. It\u2019s a serious investment, but one that\u2019s built to last.\nWho it\u2019s best for\nProfessionals, gamers and hybrid users who spend long hours seated and want advanced ergonomic support. It is especially suited for those with back or shoulder strain from prolonged computer use who value precise adjustability and long-term durability over flashy aesthetics. It's also great for those who want one chair that works equally well for productivity and play.\nWho should skip it\nIt is not the right fit for casual gamers who only sit for short periods or those on a tight budget. It's also not for people who prefer the aggressive styling of typical gaming chairs or need headrests, which the Embody lacks. If color and aesthetics are your main priorities, the subtle look may feel underwhelming despite the performance.\nPros\n- Excellent lumbar support\n- Highly adjustable ergonomic fit\n- Smooth-gliding inline-style wheels\nCons\n- More expensive than many gaming chairs with similar features\nWhy I like it\nThe X-Chair X3 blends sleek office design with features typically found in premium gaming chairs. Its standout feature, Dynamic Variable Lumbar (DVL) support, adjusts with your movement to maintain constant lower back support. The mesh back promotes airflow, which is great for staying cool during long gaming sessions, and the foam seat base slides forward and back for personalized comfort. The headrest is both height- and tilt-adjustable, and the 4D armrests add flexibility. Premium X-wheel casters glide silently and won\u2019t mark your floors, while the water- and stain-resistant nylon upholstery holds up to daily use.\nWho it\u2019s best for\nIt's essentially an office chair, so this is a fit if you're after something without the \"gamer\" look and good ergonomics. It's also a great choice for taller users (up to 6-foot-3-inches tall) and heavier people (up to 350 pounds), especially for those who sit for extended periods and value breathability and lumbar support.\nWho should skip it\nThe price starts at $879, and while that's significantly less than the Embody chair, it's still expensive. Plus, the price goes higher with upgrades like premium wheels or locking casters. It may also not appeal to those who prefer a softer, more plush seat or a chair with bold, gaming-style aesthetics. If you don\u2019t need high-end adjustability or plan to sit for only short sessions, this is probably overkill.\nGaming chair comparison\nSpecifications\n| Chair manufacturer | Weight supported (pounds) | Recline | Armrest features | Height supported |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Secretlab Titan Evo Series | 395 | 165 degrees | 4D, magnetic tops | 5'6\"\u20136'9\" |\n| AndaSeat Kaiser 4 | 400 | 165 degrees | 4D, tilting | 5'11\"\u20136'11\" |\n| Sihoo Doro S300 | 300 | Smooth antigravity recline | 6D padded | 5'5\"\u20136'3\" |\n| AndaSeat Novis Series | 260 | 160 degrees | 4D | 5'6\"\u20136'2\" |\n| Mavix M7 | 275 | Max tilt with tension control | 4D | 5'4\"\u20136'2\" |\n| Herman Miller X Logitech Embody | 300 | Smooth recline with tilt limiter | 2D height/width | 5'3\"\u20136'1\" |\n| X-Chair X3 ATR | 340 | Dynamic recline | 4D | 5'3\"\u20136'4\" |\nA good gaming chair ranges from about $150 to more than $1,000, depending on features, design, size and materials. There are basic cloth chairs with a standard foam seat cushion, a backrest and fixed armrests, and then there are higher-end chairs made with premium materials, ergonomic features and seats that dissipate heat to keep the user cool. Then there's everything in between. Some chairs also have built-in heating and massage.\nYes, manufacturers design these chairs to be used for long stretches of time. However, when a chair is genuinely cheap, costs were cut somewhere. This could result in an uncomfortable seat cushion, poor back, arm, neck and head support or just something that doesn't last. Like a lot of products, you get what you pay for.\nWhile lower-end gaming chairs might have fixed armrests or height-adjustable armrests, a 4D armrest adds more ways to adjust allowing gamers to find that productive sweet spot. They can be adjusted vertically for taller or shorter people and moved in and out for a broad or narrow arm spread. They can also be rotated in and out and moved forward and backward.\nThere are a lot of gaming chair brands, and new ones seemingly pop up weekly.

However, we involve multiple CNET editors in the process, so the chairs get tested by people of various heights and weights and various use cases."

      "text": "Shopping for a gaming chair can be tricky: Many look alike and list the same features, but comfort and ergonomics are hard to judge without trying them. Today\u2019s chairs offer better support, breathable mesh and wider seats, making them great for gaming or office use. Whether buying for yourself or as a gift, there are options for every budget and body type. I test chairs with help from friends and family of various sizes -- I'm 6 feet tall and over 200 pounds, and some chairs feel snug, but a smaller person might find them uncomfortably large. Choosing one that matches your height and weight is crucial for optimal support. That's where I can help.\nOur Picks\nWhat's the best gaming chair overall?\nThe Secretlab Titan Evo is the best gaming chair I've tested. It combines traditional gaming style and feel with modern features like swappable skins, magnetic armrests, an optional footrest, a legrest and a wide range of designs -- all at a reasonable price. It comes in multiple sizes so that you can get an excellent fit regardless of size. That combination makes it the best overall.\nWhat we updated: June 2025\nAdded Anda Seat Kaiser 4, Sihoo Doro S300 and Anda Seat Novis Series chairs. Removed Anda Seat Fnatic Edition, Razer Iskur and Secret Labs Omega 2020.\nPros\n- Comes in three sizes\n- Adjustable built-in lumbar support\n- Locking 4D armrests\n- Multiple upholstery options and themed Skins for personalization\nCons\n- Firm seat\n- Footrest and legrest are sold separately\nWhy I like it\nThe Titan Evo builds on a top-rated design with smart, user-friendly upgrades. Its magnetic headrest and armrests simplify customization and maintenance, while the internal adjustable lumbar support and locking 4D armrests provide ergonomic comfort and stability. The wide seat, deep recline, and multiple upholstery options make it adaptable to different needs. It\u2019s also available in three sizes: small (up to 5 feet, 6 inches and 200 pounds), regular (5 feet, 7 inches to 6 feet 2 inches and up to 220 pounds) and XL (5 feet, 11 inches to 6 feet, 9 inches and up to 395 pounds). The new Secretlab Skins add another layer of personalization and protection.\nWho it\u2019s best for\nIt is ideal for gamers and remote workers who spend long hours at their desks and value comfort and customization. It's especially well-suited for people who want a high-end, adjustable chair that fits their body type -- thanks to three size options -- and those who appreciate aesthetic flexibility through themed skins.\nWho should skip it\nIt's not a great match for those who prefer a soft, plush seat or minimalist office chairs without gaming aesthetics. It may also be too expensive for budget-conscious buyers or overkill for those who only sit for short periods.\nPros\n- Extra-wide seat base is ideal for sitting cross-legged or with feet up\n- Fits a wide height-and-weight range\n- Choice of premium PVC leather or linen in multiple colors\n- Upgraded magnetic headrest for easy adjustment\n- 4D armrests with added tilt\nCons\n- Large footprint may not fit smaller spaces\n- Limited fabric options\n- Aside from an upward tilt, the armrests don't lock in place\nWhy I like it\nThe Kaiser 4 improves on AndaSeat's previous models with thoughtful design upgrades. It includes internal adjustable lumbar support, a magnetic headrest for easy height adjustment and 4D armrests that tilt upward, making it ideal for console or handheld gaming. The broad base, spacious seat and plush materials -- premium PVC leather or linen fabric -- add to its comfort. It\u2019s available in lots of colors and two sizes that support people up to 6-feet-11-inches tall and 397 pounds (the XL model, in particular, cradles you like a baseball in a mitt).\nWho it\u2019s best for\nIt's great for gamers who like to sit cross-legged or with their feet up and for people who spend long hours seated for work, play or lounging. It\u2019s especially suited for people who want a traditional gaming chair style with premium materials and ergonomic enhancements.\nWho should skip it\nIt's not ideal for those who prefer a minimalist or office-style aesthetic, or if you're looking for mesh-backed breathability. It\u2019s also not the best choice if you need compact dimensions for smaller spaces, as the chair\u2019s wide footprint may overwhelm tight setups.\nPros\n- Antigravity mechanism gives you a weightless feel\n- Breathable mesh helps keep you cool\n- Fully adjustable armrests for custom positioning\n- Ideal for handheld or controller gamers\nCons\n- Armrests don\u2019t lock into place\n- Less cushioned than traditional seats\n- Ratcheting backrest system doesn't lock\nWhy I like it\nThe Sihoo Doro S300 has excellent ergonomics for all-day comfort. Its standout feature is the 6D padded armrests, which can tilt inward and upward, perfect for console gaming or adjusting your posture throughout the day. The company used premium materials like aluminum alloy, breathable mesh and soft velvet, and the dual lumbar support, five-level adjustable backrest and an antigravity mechanism make you feel weightless when you recline. Add in a 30-day trial and a 5-year warranty, and this $679 chair clearly delivers both style and substance.\nWho it\u2019s best for\nThose who spend long hours at their desks: remote workers, gamers, or anyone needing a breathable yet supportive chair. It\u2019s especially great if you like a lot of adjustability, like console players or handheld gamers who benefit from the armrest tilt.\nWho should skip it\nI don't recommend it if you want locking armrests; the 6D arms can shift when getting in or out of the chair. The mesh seat means no plush cushioning or a more traditional executive-style seat. Also, at $679, it's not exactly a bargain, though you do get what you pay for.\nPros\n- Affordable price with a premium look and feel\n- Adjustable armrests suit various desk heights\n- Well-cushioned seat for long sitting sessions\n- Compact design fits most office or desk setups\nCons\n- Lacks advanced lumbar support (no pop-out feature)\n- Armrests don\u2019t rotate like higher-end models (e.g., Kaiser 4)\n- May not meet the needs of heavy or hardcore gamers\nWhy I like it\nThe AndaSeat Novis Series offers impressive quality at an affordable $250 price. It\u2019s easy to assemble (about 30 minutes, solo), fits most desk setups and features adjustable armrests that can clear standard desks even at their lowest setting. The seat is well-cushioned and supportive for long periods of use, with enough width to sit cross-legged comfortably, especially great for smaller users.

      "text": "Gaming desktops still play second fiddle to gaming laptops for most people, but PCs have a place in the hearts of those who want power and upgradability for now and the future. PC configurations change a lot more frequently, though, and it's hard to keep up with testing and reviews, so our current gaming PC recommendations may include previous configurations that we've reviewed. We also include configuration suggestions that we haven't specifically tested but are based on our experience with similar components.\nOur Picks\nWhat's the best gaming PC overall?\nOur pick for the best gaming desktop is the Lenovo Legion Tower 7i, thanks to its solid performance up through 4K, without costing as much as you'd usually spend. It's got some flaws -- you can't overclock the memory and it's a little light on the dust filtering -- but for a prebuilt model costing $2,220 (at the time of writing this) it's a nice balance.\nThe Best Gaming PCs\nPros\n- Great 1080p and 4K performance\n- Looks good, and has abundant RGB lighting\n- Operates quietly without throttling\nCons\n- We'd like more USB-C ports\n- Limited dust filtration\nDelivering good performance and 4K gaming without a sky-high price, Lenovo's midrange Legion T7i runs quietly at top speeds and looks stylish while doing so -- even without jumping to the more recent RTX 50-class GPUs.\nBut even in 2024 we'd have expected more than one USB-C port, especially since lots of gaming accessories have been switching over, and some better dust filtering would be welcome.\nIt's a decent gaming system and configuration that should last you a while, and there's a cheaper configuration with an RTX 4070 Ti that might also serve you well if you're looking for something reasonable from a major manufacturer.\nPros\n- Slick and fairly compact design\n- Largely quiet even under load\n- Tool-free access and parts abound\n- Nice set of connections\nCons\n- Performance not up to what we expect for the money\n- Custom components and layout means upgrades may be a problem\n- Case design has the potential to suck in dust\nAlienware drew a little further away from its roots in 2024, redesigning its Aurora desktop to look novel and stylish but not as out-of-this-world as it was. That allowed the company to shrink its overlarge footprint as well as introducing tool-free access and parts to what's still a fast and quiet system.\nBut it's still relatively expensive for its configuration -- and that's before tariffs factor in whenever you decide to buy -- with a quirky, proprietary layout that may make upgrades more expensive or awkward than they might be in other systems. And the new design has unfiltered intakes, which our reviewer thinks might require above-average vigilance for you to keep under control.\nThough Alienware has repositioned the Aurora as its \"entry\" line, you still don't go to Alienware looking for bargains; it's an entry to Alienware, and you should expect to pay a little more to get its novel looks, but it's not a great choice if you want to tinker a lot or live in a dusty environment.\nThe model we tested has subsequently been refreshed with Core Ultra CPUs and RTX 50-series GPUs and renamed simply \"Aurora.\" I recommend the $2,150 Core Ultra 9 285, RTX 5060 Ti configuration, which is comparably priced and should deliver equivalent performance.\nPros\n- Strong 1080p performance for the money\n- Lovely case design and lighting\n- Good base configuration\nCons\n- Lacks dust filtration\n- The inside isn't very attractive, so it doesn't really merit the glass panel\n- Only a single USB-C port\nWith solid 1080p gaming performance at a reasonable price -- not sub-$1,000 but close -- the Tower 5 has style that you don't often see in budget models.\nBut it still cuts some corners you might expect to be cut in a low-price gaming system, such as few refinements on the inside to spruce it up, mostly USB-A ports and minimalist dust prevention.\nIf you're looking for a budget gaming PC from a major manufacturer, the Legion Tower 5i will probably serve you well.\nPros\n- Really fast and quiet\n- Compact\n- Thunderbolt 5/USB4\nCons\n- Because Apple doesn't support discrete GPUs, you have to buy a more powerful CPU than you might want\n- Can't upgrade memory\n- M4 Max model has two fewer Thunderbolt connections than the M3 Ultra, and the front ports aren't USB 4\nIf you want to run AAA games on the Mac you don't have a lot of choice: It's either the Mac Mini or the Mac Studio (you need the more powerful GPU that you don't get with the base M4 for decent performance, which leaves out the iMac). I err on the side of the Studio because you can get the M4 Max chip and it has a higher power cooling system than the Mini -- since you can't upgrade the either of the systems, you need to buy as much as you can afford now -- but bumping up the Mini to the M4 Pro may be a solid alternative. A lot of non-AAA games that support the Mac don't need as much graphics power but if you're planning to hold on to the system for a while, you might want to assume you'll need more at some point before you're ready to give it up.\nThat said, there still aren't a ton of Mac games, despite Apple's best efforts to attract developers. And a lot of the ones that are available tend to be mobile games adapted or emulated, or free-to-play cloud-based games -- none of which require a lot of power. If that's the case, you don't need a gaming system, and a Mini or iMac should suffice.\nSpecifications for gaming desktop test configurations\n| Alienware Aurora R16 | Apple Mac Studio (2025) | Lenovo Legion Tower 5i Gen 8 26IRB8 (90UT001AUS) | Lenovo Legion Tower 7i Gen 8 34IRZ8 | |\n| Price as reviewed | $2,365 | $3,699 | $1,149 | $2,549 |\n| Size | 38-liter custom (16.5 x 7.8 x 18.1 in/418 x 197 x 458 mm) | 3.7 x 7.7 x 7.7 in.

That means it's limited when it comes to options, ports and even airflow.\nFactors to consider when buying a gaming desktop\nSize\nThere's no one-size-fits-all answer for this. If you want high-powered components or a motherboard with more than just a slot for a graphics card, you need a midtower or full tower case -- it needs to accommodate extra cooling or a larger motherboard. If you've got limited space, measure the width and depth you can accommodate and look carefully at a computer's dimensions. If you don't plan on upgrading and can afford to pay for the configuration you're going to still want in three to five years, then you can go with a small form factor, or SFF, PC. While you can use liters as a measurement for case size, actual dimensions are more useful.\nMotherboard\nYou generally only can choose the motherboard for custom or DIY builds, but even with a prebuilt system you need to ensure it can meet your needs. For instance, not only that it has sufficient PCI slots but that if you hypothetically require both 16-bit slots to run at maximum bandwidth they will. The motherboard and its chipset determines the maximum possible USB ports; networking types; type and maximum amount of memory; maximum amount and type of SSD and more. Prebuilt and small systems sometimes have proprietary motherboards, so confirm you'll be able to upgrade if you think you'll want to.\nOperating system\nWindows. You can play games on MacOS or Linux, but far more games are developed for and supported on Windows.\nProcessor\nThe CPU doesn't matter as much as other components, but games that spawn and calculate the movements of a lot of objects or characters -- complex simulations and RTS, for example -- may lean on it to run well. AMD's chips with \"X3D\" in the name are its best gaming CPUs, while Intel's overclockable chips have \"K\" in their model names and its Core processors are still generally better for desktop gaming than its newer Core Ultra CPUs.\nGraphics\nFor the most part, the GPU is the most important component for running games, not just to render quickly and at high resolutions now, but to drive AI-based upscaling technologies without sacrificing frame rates or smoothly running AI-based technologies of the near future (such as in-game contextual help or smart NPCs). The amount of memory accessible by the GPU also makes a difference: I recommend at least 8GB VRAM for 1080p, 12GB for 1440p or 16GB for 4K. The amount of VRAM tends to correlate with the class of GPU, and the class correlates with speed; in other words, in general (but not necessarily so), more memory means a faster class of card and a faster class of card means a higher frame rate.\nSystem memory\nI don't recommend ANY system with 8GB RAM or less -- 16GB should be your absolute minimum and many games already require that much -- but 32GB is a good bet to support games for at least another few years. Most desktops let you upgrade memory; ultracompacts or all-in-ones may use laptop parts, which means soldered (and therefore not upgradeable) memory, so you want to watch for that if you plan on saving money now.\nStorage\nGames are getting bigger and bigger, so more storage is always better. If you play serially you can probably get by backing up to an external SSD, but if you jump around or want to keep multiple games installed on your system (and use the system for more than just gaming!), I suggest 1TB minimum.\nThe review process for desktops consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our reviewers. This includes evaluating a device's aesthetics, ergonomics and features with respect to price. A final review verdict is a combination of objective and subjective judgments.\nHow we test gaming desktops\nWe test all desktops with a core set of benchmarks, including Primate Labs Geekbench 6 and Geekbench AI, Cinebench 2024, PCMark 10, a variety of 3DMark benchmarks (whichever can run on the desktop), UL Procyon Computer Vision and Image Generation AI benchmarks and more. If a desktop is intended for gaming, we'll also run benchmarks from Guardians of the Galaxy, The Rift Breaker (CPU and GPU), Shadow of the Tomb Raider as part of our core set, then supplement with a variety of other game benchmarks (such as Returnal and Cyberpunk 2077) and general gameplay, all in a variety of resolutions depending upon the system. Our testing suite for systems with discrete graphics also includes SPECviewperf 2020 for pro graphics.\nFor the hands-on, the reviewer uses it for their work and gaming during the review period, evaluating how well the design, features (such as the screen, camera and speakers) and manufacturer-supplied software operate as a cohesive whole. We also place importance on how well they work given their cost and where the manufacturer has potentially made upgrades or tradeoffs for its price.\nThe list of benchmarking software and comparison criteria we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve. We do not report all the results of our testing, only the data which adds information rather than duplicating a comparative pattern."

      "text": "Shopping for a gaming chair can be tricky: Many look alike and list the same features, but comfort and ergonomics are hard to judge without trying them. Today\u2019s chairs offer better support, breathable mesh and wider seats, making them great for gaming or office use. Whether buying for yourself or as a gift, there are options for every budget and body type. I test chairs with help from friends and family of various sizes -- I'm 6 feet tall and over 200 pounds, and some chairs feel snug, but a smaller person might find them uncomfortably large. Choosing one that matches your height and weight is crucial for optimal support. That's where I can help.\nOur Picks\nWhat's the best gaming chair overall?\nThe Secretlab Titan Evo is the best gaming chair I've tested. It combines traditional gaming style and feel with modern features like swappable skins, magnetic armrests, an optional footrest, a legrest and a wide range of designs -- all at a reasonable price. It comes in multiple sizes so that you can get an excellent fit regardless of size. That combination makes it the best overall.\nWhat we updated: June 2025\nAdded Anda Seat Kaiser 4, Sihoo Doro S300 and Anda Seat Novis Series chairs. Removed Anda Seat Fnatic Edition, Razer Iskur and Secret Labs Omega 2020.\nPros\n- Comes in three sizes\n- Adjustable built-in lumbar support\n- Locking 4D armrests\n- Multiple upholstery options and themed Skins for personalization\nCons\n- Firm seat\n- Footrest and legrest are sold separately\nWhy I like it\nThe Titan Evo builds on a top-rated design with smart, user-friendly upgrades. Its magnetic headrest and armrests simplify customization and maintenance, while the internal adjustable lumbar support and locking 4D armrests provide ergonomic comfort and stability. The wide seat, deep recline, and multiple upholstery options make it adaptable to different needs. It\u2019s also available in three sizes: small (up to 5 feet, 6 inches and 200 pounds), regular (5 feet, 7 inches to 6 feet 2 inches and up to 220 pounds) and XL (5 feet, 11 inches to 6 feet, 9 inches and up to 395 pounds). The new Secretlab Skins add another layer of personalization and protection.\nWho it\u2019s best for\nIt is ideal for gamers and remote workers who spend long hours at their desks and value comfort and customization. It's especially well-suited for people who want a high-end, adjustable chair that fits their body type -- thanks to three size options -- and those who appreciate aesthetic flexibility through themed skins.\nWho should skip it\nIt's not a great match for those who prefer a soft, plush seat or minimalist office chairs without gaming aesthetics. It may also be too expensive for budget-conscious buyers or overkill for those who only sit for short periods.\nPros\n- Extra-wide seat base is ideal for sitting cross-legged or with feet up\n- Fits a wide height-and-weight range\n- Choice of premium PVC leather or linen in multiple colors\n- Upgraded magnetic headrest for easy adjustment\n- 4D armrests with added tilt\nCons\n- Large footprint may not fit smaller spaces\n- Limited fabric options\n- Aside from an upward tilt, the armrests don't lock in place\nWhy I like it\nThe Kaiser 4 improves on AndaSeat's previous models with thoughtful design upgrades. It includes internal adjustable lumbar support, a magnetic headrest for easy height adjustment and 4D armrests that tilt upward, making it ideal for console or handheld gaming. The broad base, spacious seat and plush materials -- premium PVC leather or linen fabric -- add to its comfort. It\u2019s available in lots of colors and two sizes that support people up to 6-feet-11-inches tall and 397 pounds (the XL model, in particular, cradles you like a baseball in a mitt).\nWho it\u2019s best for\nIt's great for gamers who like to sit cross-legged or with their feet up and for people who spend long hours seated for work, play or lounging. It\u2019s especially suited for people who want a traditional gaming chair style with premium materials and ergonomic enhancements.\nWho should skip it\nIt's not ideal for those who prefer a minimalist or office-style aesthetic, or if you're looking for mesh-backed breathability. It\u2019s also not the best choice if you need compact dimensions for smaller spaces, as the chair\u2019s wide footprint may overwhelm tight setups.\nPros\n- Antigravity mechanism gives you a weightless feel\n- Breathable mesh helps keep you cool\n- Fully adjustable armrests for custom positioning\n- Ideal for handheld or controller gamers\nCons\n- Armrests don\u2019t lock into place\n- Less cushioned than traditional seats\n- Ratcheting backrest system doesn't lock\nWhy I like it\nThe Sihoo Doro S300 has excellent ergonomics for all-day comfort. Its standout feature is the 6D padded armrests, which can tilt inward and upward, perfect for console gaming or adjusting your posture throughout the day. The company used premium materials like aluminum alloy, breathable mesh and soft velvet, and the dual lumbar support, five-level adjustable backrest and an antigravity mechanism make you feel weightless when you recline. Add in a 30-day trial and a 5-year warranty, and this $679 chair clearly delivers both style and substance.\nWho it\u2019s best for\nThose who spend long hours at their desks: remote workers, gamers, or anyone needing a breathable yet supportive chair. It\u2019s especially great if you like a lot of adjustability, like console players or handheld gamers who benefit from the armrest tilt.\nWho should skip it\nI don't recommend it if you want locking armrests; the 6D arms can shift when getting in or out of the chair. The mesh seat means no plush cushioning or a more traditional executive-style seat. Also, at $679, it's not exactly a bargain, though you do get what you pay for.\nPros\n- Affordable price with a premium look and feel\n- Adjustable armrests suit various desk heights\n- Well-cushioned seat for long sitting sessions\n- Compact design fits most office or desk setups\nCons\n- Lacks advanced lumbar support (no pop-out feature)\n- Armrests don\u2019t rotate like higher-end models (e.g., Kaiser 4)\n- May not meet the needs of heavy or hardcore gamers\nWhy I like it\nThe AndaSeat Novis Series offers impressive quality at an affordable $250 price. It\u2019s easy to assemble (about 30 minutes, solo), fits most desk setups and features adjustable armrests that can clear standard desks even at their lowest setting. The seat is well-cushioned and supportive for long periods of use, with enough width to sit cross-legged comfortably, especially great for smaller users. Despite the budget price, the premium PVC leather finish gives it a high-end look and feel.\nWho it\u2019s best for\nIt's perfect for budget-conscious buyers who want a versatile, comfortable chair for gaming and office use. It\u2019s especially well-suited for petite users or those with smaller workspaces who still want adjustable features and lasting comfort. You don\u2019t need to be a gamer to enjoy it -- it\u2019s a great all-around ergonomic chair.\nWho should skip it\nHard-core gamers looking for advanced features like pop-out lumbar support or rotating armrests should give it a pass. It may feel too basic if you want highly customizable ergonomic adjustments or prefer a heavier-duty build (like what the Kaiser 4 on this list offers). Taller people may also want to double-check armrest and seat dimensions before committing.\nPros\n- Sleek, professional look\n- Mesh back for breathability and airflow\n- Highly adjustable for comfort and support\n- Full back support and headrest\n- Bold color accents offer subtle gaming flair\nCons\n- Premium price\n- Bold accents may still stand out in minimalist setups\n- Limited color combinations compared to typical gaming chairs\nWhy I like it\nThe Mavix M7 combines the comfort and adjustability of a high-end ergonomic office chair, but it still shows the company's gaming roots. It offers full back support, a breathable mesh back, 360-degree adjustable armrests and a bold, removable headrest and lumbar cushions. Its sleek design makes it one of the few gaming chairs that can blend seamlessly into a professional office. It\u2019s also one of the most comfortable and adjustable chairs I've tested.\nWho it\u2019s best for\nThis one is a solid choice for professionals or gamers who want the ergonomic benefits of an office chair and the comfort of a gaming chair, but without the flashy design. It\u2019s perfect for someone who spends long hours at a desk and values airflow, adjustability and understated aesthetics.\nWho should skip it\nAt nearly $800, the M7 is firmly in the \"premium\" category. It also won\u2019t satisfy those who prefer the traditional plush look and feel of racing-style gaming chairs with faux leather and bold colors throughout.\nPros\n- Exceptional back and shoulder support\n- Breathable, layered upholstery keeps you cool\n- 12-year warranty\nCons\n- Very expensive\n- \u201cGamer\u201d version differs mostly in color accents\n- Lacks traditional gaming chair aesthetic\nWhy I like it\nThe Embody Gaming Chair delivers top-tier ergonomic performance with exceptional back and shoulder support, ideal for long hours of work or gaming. Its standout feature is the dynamic tension adjustment system, allowing you to fine-tune support across a wide range of motion. The breathable \"pixelated support\" material keeps you cool while the build quality and comfort remain unmatched. Though branded for gamers, its design is subtle -- aside from optional ocean blue accents -- and it retains the same premium craftsmanship and 12-year warranty as the original office version. It\u2019s a serious investment, but one that\u2019s built to last.\nWho it\u2019s best for\nProfessionals, gamers and hybrid users who spend long hours seated and want advanced ergonomic support. It is especially suited for those with back or shoulder strain from prolonged computer use who value precise adjustability and long-term durability over flashy aesthetics. It's also great for those who want one chair that works equally well for productivity and play.\nWho should skip it\nIt is not the right fit for casual gamers who only sit for short periods or those on a tight budget. It's also not for people who prefer the aggressive styling of typical gaming chairs or need headrests, which the Embody lacks. If color and aesthetics are your main priorities, the subtle look may feel underwhelming despite the performance.\nPros\n- Excellent lumbar support\n- Highly adjustable ergonomic fit\n- Smooth-gliding inline-style wheels\nCons\n- More expensive than many gaming chairs with similar features\nWhy I like it\nThe X-Chair X3 blends sleek office design with features typically found in premium gaming chairs. Its standout feature, Dynamic Variable Lumbar (DVL) support, adjusts with your movement to maintain constant lower back support. The mesh back promotes airflow, which is great for staying cool during long gaming sessions, and the foam seat base slides forward and back for personalized comfort. The headrest is both height- and tilt-adjustable, and the 4D armrests add flexibility. Premium X-wheel casters glide silently and won\u2019t mark your floors, while the water- and stain-resistant nylon upholstery holds up to daily use.\nWho it\u2019s best for\nIt's essentially an office chair, so this is a fit if you're after something without the \"gamer\" look and good ergonomics. It's also a great choice for taller users (up to 6-foot-3-inches tall) and heavier people (up to 350 pounds), especially for those who sit for extended periods and value breathability and lumbar support.\nWho should skip it\nThe price starts at $879, and while that's significantly less than the Embody chair, it's still expensive. Plus, the price goes higher with upgrades like premium wheels or locking casters. It may also not appeal to those who prefer a softer, more plush seat or a chair with bold, gaming-style aesthetics. If you don\u2019t need high-end adjustability or plan to sit for only short sessions, this is probably overkill.\nGaming chair comparison\nSpecifications\n| Chair manufacturer | Weight supported (pounds) | Recline | Armrest features | Height supported |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Secretlab Titan Evo Series | 395 | 165 degrees | 4D, magnetic tops | 5'6\"\u20136'9\" |\n| AndaSeat Kaiser 4 | 400 | 165 degrees | 4D, tilting | 5'11\"\u20136'11\" |\n| Sihoo Doro S300 | 300 | Smooth antigravity recline | 6D padded | 5'5\"\u20136'3\" |\n| AndaSeat Novis Series | 260 | 160 degrees | 4D | 5'6\"\u20136'2\" |\n| Mavix M7 | 275 | Max tilt with tension control | 4D | 5'4\"\u20136'2\" |\n| Herman Miller X Logitech Embody | 300 | Smooth recline with tilt limiter | 2D height/width | 5'3\"\u20136'1\" |\n| X-Chair X3 ATR | 340 | Dynamic recline | 4D | 5'3\"\u20136'4\" |\nA good gaming chair ranges from about $150 to more than $1,000, depending on features, design, size and materials. There are basic cloth chairs with a standard foam seat cushion, a backrest and fixed armrests, and then there are higher-end chairs made with premium materials, ergonomic features and seats that dissipate heat to keep the user cool. Then there's everything in between. Some chairs also have built-in heating and massage.\nYes, manufacturers design these chairs to be used for long stretches of time. However, when a chair is genuinely cheap, costs were cut somewhere. This could result in an uncomfortable seat cushion, poor back, arm, neck and head support or just something that doesn't last. Like a lot of products, you get what you pay for.\nWhile lower-end gaming chairs might have fixed armrests or height-adjustable armrests, a 4D armrest adds more ways to adjust allowing gamers to find that productive sweet spot. They can be adjusted vertically for taller or shorter people and moved in and out for a broad or narrow arm spread. They can also be rotated in and out and moved forward and backward.\nThere are a lot of gaming chair brands, and new ones seemingly pop up weekly. With that in mind, here are the best gaming chair brands CNET editors have tested and have performed well over time.\n- Secretlab: Known for Titan Evo Series, magnetic accessories\n- Anda Seat: Popular models include Kaiser 4, Phantom 3 and Marvel-themed chairs\n- DXRacer: Popular models include Formula Series, Master Series\n- Razer: Popular models include Iskur and Enki series\n- Noblechairs: Popular models include Hero, Epic, Icon\n- Vertagear: Popular models include SL5000, PL4500\n- Mavix: Popular models include M7, M9\n- Corsair: Popular models include TC100, TC200\n- Respawn: Known for budget-friendly chairs under $300\nHow we test chairs\nOur gaming chair testing is much like you might test one: We use them daily for work, gaming, to evaluate comfort, support and real-world performance. However, we involve multiple CNET editors in the process, so the chairs get tested by people of various heights and weights and various use cases."
