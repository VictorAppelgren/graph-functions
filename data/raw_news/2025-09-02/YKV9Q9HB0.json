      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."

      "text": "World Series champion Mark Teixeira said he can\u2019t have a conversation with people who say men can get pregnant, citing how the political divide in the United States has grown.\nTeixeira, who launched his campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives last week, said he has \"no problem\" talking to Democrats about tax rates or national security, but not about men getting pregnant.\n\"I have no problem talking to you about tax rates or national security or things that are maybe going to make our country better. But when you say that men can get pregnant, where do I go with that?\" Teixeira said in an appearance on OutKick\u2019s \"Don\u2019t @ Me with Dan Dakich.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\"I can\u2019t have a conversation with you if that\u2019s what you truly believe, and I think that so many people on the left have gone off the map that it creates this huge divide, that it\u2019s tough to bridge that gap.\"\nThe former New York Yankees star said people have asked him why he chose to go into politics when it\u2019s so divided. Teixeira said that conservatives haven\u2019t moved that much further right, while Democrats \"have moved completely off the map to the left.\"\nOutKick\u2019s Dan Dakich said the shift to the left has created a distraction from what\u2019s real, and Teixeira agreed with that assessment.\n\"Dan, one of the reasons I\u2019m running is because people are real. People that need better jobs, people that want lower tax rates, people that want their cities and their streets to be safe, those are the people that I\u2019m running for. My district is the most beautiful district in Texas, it\u2019s the hill country, hard-working people,\" Teixeira said.\nPADRES ALL-STAR RELIEVER CARTED OFF FIELD AFTER COLLAPSING WITH APPARENT SEASON-ENDING INJURY\n\"These men and women, they go to church on Sundays and barbecue afterward. These are just good patriots and they want the government to work for them. They don\u2019t want to be controlled by the government or be told what to do, be told to wear masks, be told you can\u2019t go to school, be told that if you build a company it\u2019s because the government built it for you. That\u2019s baloney.\"\n\"I think the American people are waking up, that the America First agenda is the one that is working for them.\"\nThe three-time All-Star is campaigning for Texas\u2019 21st Congressional District. Teixeira\u2019s announcement followed Rep. Chip Roy\u2019s decision not to seek re-election as he runs for Texas attorney general.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe 45-year-old played for four teams in his major league career. Teixeira debuted with the Texas Rangers and spent five seasons with the team before being traded to the Atlanta Braves.\nHe was later traded to the Los Angeles Angels after parts of two seasons with the Braves and then signed with the Yankees.\nThe five-time Gold Glove winner was a key part of the 2009 Yankees team that beat the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series. Teixeira finished his career with a .268 batting average, 409 home runs and 1,298 RBI.\nFollow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter."
