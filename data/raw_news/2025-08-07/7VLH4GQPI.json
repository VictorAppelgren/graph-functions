The victims include 34-year-old Manuel Cabral Torres, his wife Andrea Banuelos Salazar, and their children \u2014 ages 2, 5, and 12.\n\nThe crash happened Monday morning when a pickup truck crossed into oncoming traffic and collided head-on with the family's SUV, according to the Colorado State Patrol. The impact caused both vehicles to catch fire. All five occupants of the SUV died at the scene.\n\nThe driver of the pickup was airlifted to a hospital with life-threatening injuries and remains in stable condition in the intensive care unit. The crash is still under investigation.\n\nManuel Cabral Torres' mother, Maria Torres Reyes, is traveling from Mexico to Colorado to bid her family farewell.\n\n\"My son, his wife, my grandchildren \u2014 it's all very painful,\" she said in Spanish. \"I love them so much. I'm just so sad.\"\n\nTorres Reyes said she last saw her family in April. She frequently visited Colorado to help care for her grandchildren.\n\nIn a statement, Colorado State Patrol Chief Matthew C. Packard urged drivers to remain vigilant behind the wheel and said in part:\n\n\"Wrong-way and wrong-side-of-the-road crashes are frequently the results of impairment, inattentive driving, or excessive speed,\" Packard said. \"You can expect strict enforcement of our traffic laws when you see a Colorado State Trooper. You will also receive a thorough investigation into these crashes.\"\n\nThe Grand County Coroner's Office extended its condolences to the surviving family members, and the West Grand School District said support services will be available to students and staff affected by the tragedy.",
