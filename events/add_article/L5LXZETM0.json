      "summary": "Apple’s rumored iPhone 17 Air is slated to feature a 6.6‑inch OLED ProMotion display, a titanium frame, a single 48‑MP rear camera, and an A19‑based chip, with a price around $899.  Early‑adopter concerns echo past first‑run glitches—overheating, battery life, and structural issues—while Apple may mitigate them with a new C1 modem and custom Wi‑Fi.  The device is expected to launch in September 2025, offering a slimmer, premium alternative to the 17 Pro line but potentially sacrificing camera versatility and battery endurance.  Overall, the market will watch for how Apple balances form, performance, and reliability in this new ultra‑thin flagship.",
