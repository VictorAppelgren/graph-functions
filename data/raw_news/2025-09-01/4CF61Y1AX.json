  "title": "Tesco Share Price: The ASDA Threat Is Over",
  "description": "The Tesco share price has hit a decade high. With previous concerns surrounding ASDA now evaporating, the question now turns to whether the shares are still undervalued.",
  "content": "The Tesco share price (LON:TSCO) has hit a decade high, and so has its UK market share. With previous concerns surrounding ASDA now evaporating, the question now turns to whether the shares still have upside on a fair value basis.\n\nShareholders were spooked earlier this year when key competitor ASDA unveiled its plans to launch aggressive rollbacks to its prices. This subsequently led to the Tesco share price sinking by as much as 15.3%. But those who had conviction in Britain\u2019s largest grocer and bought its shares at the bottom would have secured a lofty gain of 34.8% in less than 4 months \u2013 outstripping both the FTSE 100 (+16.1%) and S&P 500 (+22.6%).\n\nInvestors had initially feared that ASDA\u2019s undercuts would lead to market leaders Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s having to lower prices to an unreasonable point in order to maintain their market shares. This would have come at the expense of their margins and profits. Tesco\u2019s board were even spooked by the move, as they guided for a conservative EBIT range of \u00a32.70-3.00 billion when they unveiled their FY25 results, which was reiterated in the Q1 update.\n\nThankfully, however, ASDA\u2019s threats have failed to materialise thus far. As a matter of fact, the results have been quite the opposite, with Tesco seeing its biggest UK market share gain this year (+0.8%), while ASDA continues to lose ground (-0.9%). Moreover, the latest Kantar data recorded Tesco sales rising a whopping 7.4% \u2013 almost double the market\u2019s 4.0%, while ASDA\u2019s sales remain in negative territory (-2.6%).\n\nSo, what gives? Well, ASDA\u2019s underwhelming rollbacks can be attributed to a couple of main points. The first is that many of its items \u2013 despite having decent price differentials of around 3.0-5.0% \u2013 have mostly involved non-core items. These include products such as toilet paper, bathroom gels, baby products, etc. which don\u2019t move the needle when it comes to true price perception. What\u2019s more, many of these promotions have also lasted shorter than expected.\n\nSecondly, the point Tesco CEO Ken Murphy has been driving home over the last few earnings calls is showing up in the data \u2013 consumers focus on more than just value. They\u2019re looking for a full shopping experience, and it should go without saying that Tesco has managed to refine its shoppers\u2019 experience through better packaging, deals, store retrofits, digital experiences, and a rewarding loyalty scheme \u2013 areas where ASDA has fallen short in.\n\nAs such, I have strong reason to believe that an imminent upgrade to FY26\u2019s EBIT will come to fruition when Tesco unveils its half-year results in October. Market consensus is still lingering on the side of caution with an EBIT of \u00a32.96 billion, marking a 5.2% drop from last year. However, I\u2019m more optimistic with my more upbeat projection of \u00a33.12 billion, which marks a less pronounced 0.3% decrease.\n\nThere are several reasons behind my estimate. First and foremost, although ASDA still seems adamant to undercut its competition having refinanced the bulk of its debt to the 2030s, it still has a hefty debt pile of \u00a34.60 billion. With ratings agencies such as Fitch downgrading ASDA\u2019s debt profile, the scale of rollbacks may lessen by Christmas if sales don\u2019t improve, as the firm may not want to risk further rating downgrades or liquidity strains.\n\nSecondly, Tesco\u2019s market share gains keep widening. Whilst I was initially wary of decelerating sales growth as a result of industry competition and a worsening macroeconomic outlook stemming from higher unemployment and declining real wage growth, the data has suggested otherwise. Tesco\u2019s consumers are still trading up to branded goods, with premium-line items making up a bigger proportion of customers\u2019 baskets.\n\nAnd while branded goods are seen to be more margin dilutive, I have conviction that the trading up activity will flow through to margin-accretive own-brand sales as well. This should offset the margin losses in the former. After all, a hefty chunk of branded promotional items are still being funded by suppliers, which gives a form of margin cushion.\n\nMore promisingly, grocery inflation looks to have peaked as well, with August\u2019s release seeing the first deceleration since January. This is most likely due to the fact that much of the recent price increases have been a result of administered labour price hikes rather than underlying food supply costs. In fact, four of the top five key commodities which tend to be leading indicators for grocery inflation, have been disinflating/deflating in price.\n\nAs a result of the factors discussed, I believe Tesco would not have to employ as much capital as it initially intended to in order to lower its prices and compete with its peers. Hence, I\u2019ve estimated Tesco\u2019s FY26 EBIT margin to come in at 4.28% \u2013 18bps higher than the market\u2019s current consensus of 4.10%. This is, however, contingent on no further tax/administered wage hikes or supply shocks coming into play between now and next year.\n\nAlongside this, I\u2019m also anticipating the company to complete its \u00a31.45 billion share buyback programme before the end of its financial year in February, given the rate of buybacks I\u2019ve observed. The group is approximately \u00a3100 million ahead of my initial estimated timeline. Therefore, this should serve as a small tailwind for EPS come the end of the year.\n\nHaving said that, in spite of the stellar performance and better outlook, I have reason to believe that the Tesco share price is fairly priced by my estimates. Currently, I have modelled for the conglomerate to grow at a CAGR of 10.65% through to FY28, with EPS hitting 35.09p by then \u2013 5.8% above the mid-range of consensus. This will be primarily driven by continued market share gains, bigger baskets, and further trading up momentum.\n\nDespite that, this only brings Tesco\u2019s PEG to 1.5 \u2013 not too far behind the stock\u2019s sector and historical average of 1.6. Its FP/E of 13.6 is also bang in line with its comparable average of 14.6, which doesn\u2019t leave much room for upside from a fair value perspective. Ergo, given the macroeconomic uncertainties and the relatively lofty expectations the retailer will have to achieve, I believe the stock is priced to perfection at its current level.\n\nThat being said, I wouldn\u2019t sell the stock, as Tesco has shown the potential to outperform with upside surprises. Even so, any further upside will warrant stronger market share gains, which may be difficult as share grabs become more saturated given the current micro and macro environment. Thus, that I have a fair value target of 440p for the Tesco share price.",

      "text": "Grocery price inflation has nudged down slightly to 5.0%, while take-home sales at the grocers grew by 4.0% over the four weeks to 10 August versus last year, according to our latest figures. The rate of grocery price inflation was 5.2% in July.\nWe\u2019ve seen a marginal drop in grocery price inflation this month, but we\u2019re still well past the point at which price rises really start to bite and consumers are continuing to adapt their behaviour to make ends meet. What people pay for their supermarket shopping often impacts their spending across other parts of the high street too, including their eating and drinking habits out of the home. Casual and fast service restaurants especially have seen a decline in visitors over the summer, with trips falling by 6% during the three months to mid-July 2025 \u2013 compared with last year. The outliers in this are coffee shops which have bucked the trend.\u201d\nBrands grow ahead of own label\nWhile people are making savings outside of the home, they are still seeking treats in store. Sales of branded grocery items grew by 6.1% this month, putting them ahead of own-label alternatives which were up by 4.1% \u2013the largest gap in favour of brands since March 2024. Branded sales make up 46.4% of all grocery spending but are particularly dominant in personal care, confectionery, hot drinks and soft drinks where they account for more than 75% of money through the tills. While a far smaller part of the market, premium own-label is also continuing to do well and sales rose by 11.5% this period.\nThere\u2019s a significant milestone in the freezer aisles this year as the fish finger turns 70 in September. The humble fish finger remains as popular as ever and nearly one billion were sold in the past year, with more than half of households grabbing a box.\nTheir enduring presence on our plates reflects a much broader shift in people looking for easy and quick to prepare foods. The average home cook now spends three minutes less preparing the evening meal than they did in 2017 at just under 31 minutes.* We can see this trend in the growth of things like microwaveable rice, ready meals and chilled pizza too, which have grown by 8%, 6% and 5% respectively.\nLidl joins Ocado as fastest growing grocer\nLidl and Ocado were tied for top spot as the fastest growing grocers over the 12 weeks to 10 August 2025, with sales at both retailers up by 10.7% compared to the same period last year. Lidl\u2019s share of the market increased by 0.5 percentage points to 8.3%, while Ocado now holds 1.9%, up from 1.8% in 2024. Online sales across all retailers rose by 6.7% over the 12 weeks.\nTesco enjoyed its largest monthly share gain since December 2024 as its hold of the market rose by 0.8 percentage points to 28.4%. This was driven by sales growth of 7.4% compared to last year.\nSpending through the tills at Sainsbury\u2019s was up 5.2% on last year, taking its portion of the market to 15.0%. Sales at Aldi were 4.8% higher, giving it a 10.8% share. Asda and Morrisons\u2019 shares now stand at 11.8% and 8.4% respectively.\nSpending at Waitrose grew by 4.8% over the 12 weeks, as its market share sits at 4.4%. With its sales rising by 3.4%, Iceland\u2019s hold of the market remains at 2.3%. Convenience specialist Co-op has a 5.4% share of take-home sales.\n*Worldpanel by Numerator Usage Foods, time taken to prepare evening meal 52 weeks ending June 2025 vs 52 weeks ending December 2017"
