  "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 WK Kellogg Co. plans to remove artificial dyes from its breakfast cereals in the next two and a half years, according to the company and the attorney general of Texas. The maker of Froot Loops and Apple Jacks gave the timeline as U.S. food producers face increasing pressure from the U.S. government and consumers to phase out synthetic colorings from their products.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Around the same time, U.S. health officials said that they would urge foodmakers to voluntarily work toward removing petroleum-based colors.\n\nBoth Kellogg and General Mills, another major U.S. cereal maker, said they would. General Mills later joined Kraft Heinz, Nestle, Smuckers and some other food manufacturers in announcing target dates for making all their products without artificial dyes.\n\nBut Paxton\u2019s office said Kellogg was the first to sign a \u201clegally binding\u201d agreement. \u201cFollowing months of investigating and negotiating, I\u2019m proud to officially say Kellogg\u2019s will stop putting these unhealthy ingredients in its cereals,\u201d the attorney general said in a statement.\n\nDetails about the terms of the agreement Kellogg signed, which is legally known as an assurance of voluntary compliance, were not immediately clear. The company did not comment on it directly when reached by The Associated Press on Thursday but said it appreciates \u201cthe opportunity to work collaboratively with the Texas AG\u2019s office and share their focus on health and wellness.\u201d\n\nKellogg also pointed to its earlier commitment to phase out FD&C dyes, which are synthetic additives that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for use in food, drugs and cosmetics. It said it already planned to stop launching new products with the dyes in January.\n\n\u201cWe have announced we are reformulating our cereals served in schools to not include FD&C colors by the 2026-27 school year,\u201d Kellogg said in an emailed statement Thursday. By the end of 2027, \u201cwe will completely remove FD&C colors from the small percentage of our foods that contain them today.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kellogg\u2019s website, 85% of the cereal the company sells contains no FD&C colors \u2014 and none of its products have included Red No. 3 for years. Federal regulators banned that dye from food in January.",
