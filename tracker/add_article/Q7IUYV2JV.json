      "summary": "An appeals court ruled 2‑1 in favor of the Trump‑era EPA, allowing it to claw back billions in Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants that were earmarked for climate groups, a decision that could dampen federal climate‑finance flows. The ruling follows a broader backlash against a DOE climate‑risk report that critics say misrepresents science and supports the administration’s push to roll back the 2009 Endangerment Finding. The court’s decision, coupled with the DOE report controversy, signals a tightening of federal climate‑policy enforcement and a potential shift in funding toward fossil‑fuel and energy‑security projects such as coal leasing and nuclear SMR developments.",
