  "content": "National Guard troops began deploying to the streets of Washington, DC, Tuesday, one day after President Trump signed an executive order aimed at addressing crime concerns in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cDC National Guard reporting for duty,\u201d the US Army posted on X, including photos of several military Humvees parked near the Washington Monument on the National Mall.\n\nGuardsmen, activated under the president\u2019s Title 32 authority, were even spotted posing for pictures with tourists on the first night of their deployment in the district.\n\nEarlier, the White House indicated that the National Guard was expected to \u201cbegin being on the streets starting tonight,\u201d according to the Washington Post, citing an anonymous official.\n\nOnly a small fraction of the 800 National Guard members expected to take part in the crime crackdown mission had been mobilized as of Tuesday afternoon, with more expected to deploy in the coming days, a Department of Defense official told the outlet.\n\nDemocratic DC Mayor Muriel Bowser could not say for certain what parts of the district the National Guard would patrol, but said she expected their presence to be limited to federal property \u2013 like the National Mall.\n\n\u201cMy expectation, though it can change, is that they will deploy the Guard on federal properties \u2014 that includes parks, monuments, federal buildings,\u201d Bowser said in a conversation with community leaders Tuesday night, posted on X.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the Guard will not be involved in law enforcement functions in the district, but would be able to \u201ctemporarily detain\u201d individuals if they see a crime in progress and police officers aren\u2019t around.\n\nTrump federalized the DC Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s 3,400-officer force and activated the DC National Guard on Monday, just hours after he directed some 850 federal agents to patrol the streets of the capital as part of a sweeping effort to drive down crime in the district.",

      "text": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says Trump considered re-appointing Janet Yellen as Fed chair\nPresident Trump has a \u201cvery open mind\u201d about who should replace Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and he\u2019s even considered Janet Yellen for the post, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed Tuesday.\nPowell\u2019s term as chairman of the US central bank expires in May 2026, and the Trump administration \u2013 already interviewing potential replacements \u2013 is casting a \u201cvery wide net\u201d in the search for his replacement, the treasury secretary told Fox Business host Larry Kudlow.\n\u201cThe president has a very open mind,\u201d Bessent said, when asked who Trump is eyeing to replace Powell.\n\u201cHe even considered re-appointing Janet Yellen, so we want to see what everyone\u2019s thinking,\u201d he added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not ideological, it\u2019s about economics, what\u2019s best for the American people, what\u2019s best for the economy,\u201d Bessent argued. \u201cAnd as I talk to the candidates, I\u2019m looking at three things: monetary policy, regulatory policy, and the ability to run and revamp the organization, because it\u2019s really gotten bloated and I think this bloat puts its monetary independence at risk.\u201d\nYellen, 79, served as chair of the Federal Reserve between February 2014 and February 2018, under former President Barack Obama and through the first year and change of Trump\u2019 first term in the White House.\nShe also served as treasury secretary for all of former President Joe Biden\u2019s one term in office.\nYellen recently slammed Trump\u2019s decision to fire Erika McEntarfer, the Biden-appointed former head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, over accusations that the agency had been manipulating and miscalculating employment data.\n\u201cThis is the kind of thing you would only expect to see in a banana republic,\u201d Yellen told the New York Times last week.\nAs treasury secretary, Yellen also staunchly defended Biden\u2019s handling of the inflation-ravaged US economy and criticized Trump-era policies.\n\u201cOur economic agenda is far from finished,\u201d Yellen told the Economic Club of Chicago in January 2024.\n\u201cOur country\u2019s infrastructure has been deteriorating for decades,\u201d she continued, adding that \u201cin the Trump administration, the idea of doing anything to fix it was a punchline.\u201d\nThe former Fed chair went on to claim that \u201cpast measures like the Trump administration\u2019s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act increased the deficit by $2 trillion while doing little to spur investment.\u201d\nTrump is reportedly considering as many as 10 people to replace Powell come next year.\nFormer St. Louis Fed President James Bullard; former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, Marc Sumerlin; National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett; former Fed governor Kevin Warsh; and current Fed governor Christopher Waller are among the candidates the president is considering, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nTrump has raged against Powell for the last several months over his refusal to cut interest rates, nicknaming him \u201cToo Late Powell.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, the president threatened to sue the chairman over the \u201cgrossly incompetent job\u201d he has done in managing a $2.5 billion renovation project at the Federal Reserve headquarters in Washington, DC, which the president claims \u201cshould have been a $50 Million Dollar fix up.\u201d\nTrump named ally Stephen Miran, a member of his Council of Economic Advisers, to the Fed Board last week, to replace Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, who abruptly resigned.\nBessent noted that when Powell is replaced as chairman, Trump will have \u201ca majority of the board in DC.\u201d\n\u201cAn important thing to remember is we have two seats\u201d Trump is looking to fill, Bessent told Kudlow.\n\u201cSo there\u2019s the seat for the chair and then there will be another appointee joining \u2014 so we actually get two appointments and President Trump will have a majority of the board in DC.\u201d\nThe White House did not immediately respond to The Post\u2019s request for comment."

      "text": "Zelensky says Putin wants remainder of Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region in potential cease-fire deal\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that it controls as part of a ceasefire deal, a proposal the leader categorically rejected.\nZelensky reiterated that Ukraine would not withdraw from territories it controls, saying that would be unconstitutional and would serve only as a springboard for a future Russian invasion.\nHe said diplomatic discussions led by the US focusing on ending the war have not touched on security guarantees for Ukraine to prevent future Russian aggression and that meeting formats currently being discussed do not include Europe\u2019s participation, both key demands of Kyiv.\nMeanwhile, Russian forces on the ground have been closing in on a key territorial grab around the city of Pokrovsk.\nZelensky said the necessity of territorial concessions was conveyed to him by US officials ahead of a summit Friday between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and in further meetings at the level of national security officials.\nIt remained unclear whether Ukraine would take part in the Friday summit. European Union leaders also have been sidelined from the meeting, and they appealed to Trump on Tuesday to protect their interests.\nZelensky says Ukraine will not withdraw from the Donbas\nZelensky said Putin wants the remaining 9,000 square kilometers (3,500 square miles) of Donetsk under Kyiv\u2019s control, where the war\u2019s toughest battles are grinding on, as part of a ceasefire plan, in a press briefing on Tuesday in Kyiv.\nDoing so would hand Russia almost the entirety of the Donbas, a region comprising Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial heartland that Putin has long coveted.\nZelensky learned of Russia\u2019s position after holding a call with Trump and special envoy Steve Witkoff, after the latter\u2019s bilateral meeting with Putin. Witkoff told Zelensky that Russia was ready to end the war and that there should be territorial concessions from both sides. Some European partners were also part of the call.\n\u201cAnd that, probably, Putin wants us to leave Donbas. That is, it didn\u2019t sound like America wants us to leave,\u201d he said, recounting the call.\nZelensky reiterated that withdrawing from Ukraine-controlled territory was out of the question, especially as the question of security guarantees for Ukraine, were not being discussed.\n\u201cWe will not leave Donbas. We cannot do this. Everyone forgets the first part \u2013 our territories are illegally occupied,\u201d Zelensky told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday. \u201cDonbas for the Russians is a springboard for a future new offensive.\u201d\nZelensky said this is what occurred in 2014 when Russia illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula.\nSeeking Trump\u2019s ear before the summit\nTrump has said he wants to see whether Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year.\nThe US president has disappointed allies in Europe by saying Ukraine will have to give up some Russian-held territory. He also said Russia must accept land swaps, although it was unclear what Putin might be expected to surrender.\nThe Europeans and Ukraine are wary that Putin, who has waged the biggest land war in Europe since 1945 and used Russia\u2019s energy might to try to intimidate the EU, might secure favorable concessions and set the outlines of a peace deal without them.\nReferring to the format for ceasefire talks, Zelensky said on Tuesday that the US proposed a bilateral meeting, between the US and Russia, and then a trilateral meeting that would include Ukraine. Zelensky said the presence of Europe was important for Kyiv because these were the only partners offering security guarantees, including funding the Ukrainian army.\nEuropean countries\u2019 overarching fear is that Putin will set his sights on one of them next if he wins in Ukraine.\nTheir leaders said Tuesday they \u201cwelcome the efforts of President Trump towards ending Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine.\u201d But, they underlined, \u201cthe path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine\u201d and \u201cinternational borders must not be changed by force.\u201d\nThe Europeans on Wednesday will make a fresh attempt to rally Trump to Ukraine\u2019s cause at virtual meetings convened by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Trump did not confirm whether he would take part but did say \u201cI\u2019m going to get everybody\u2019s ideas\u201d before meeting with Putin.\nRussia holds shaky control over four of the country\u2019s regions, two in the country\u2019s east and two in the south.\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the chief of Zelensky\u2019s office, said anything short of Russia\u2019s strategic defeat would mean that any ceasefire deal would be on Moscow\u2019s terms, erode international law and send a dangerous signal to the world.\nA \u2018profoundly alarming moment for Europe\u2019\nTrump\u2019s seemingly public rehabilitation of Putin \u2014 a pariah in most of Europe \u2014 has unnerved Ukraine\u2019s backers.\nThe summit in Alaska is a \u201cprofoundly alarming moment for Europe,\u201d said Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.\nAccording to Gould-Davies, Putin might persuade Trump to try to end the war by \u201caccepting Russian sovereignty\u201d over parts of Ukraine, even beyond areas that it currently occupies. Trump also could ease or lift sanctions which are causing \u201cchronic pain\u201d to the Russian economy.\nThat would provoke a \u201creally serious split in the transatlantic alliance,\u201d he said.\nThe war isn\u2019t about Russia\u2019s territorial expansion but about Putin\u2019s goal of subordinating Ukraine, which would create the opportunity to threaten other parts of Europe, Gould-Davies said.\nIt was unclear whether the Europeans also were unsettled by Trump mistakenly saying twice he would be traveling to Russia on Friday to meet Putin. The summit is taking place in the US state of Alaska, which was colonized by Russia in the 18th century until Czar Alexander II sold it to the US in 1867.\nTuesday\u2019s European joint statement was meant to be a demonstration of unity. But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who is Putin\u2019s closest ally in Europe and has tried to block EU support for Ukraine, was the only one of the bloc\u2019s 27 leaders who refused to endorse it.\nRussia closes in on Pokrovsk\nRussia appeared closer to taking an important city in the Donetsk region, Pokrovsk.\nMilitary analysts using open-source information to monitor the battles said the next 24-48 hours could be critical. Losing Pokrovsk would hand Russia an important victory ahead of the summit. It also would complicate Ukrainian supply lines to the Donetsk region, where the Kremlin has focused the bulk of military efforts.\n\u201cA lot will depend on availability, quantity and quality of Ukrainian reserves,\u201d Pasi Paroinen, an analyst with the Finland-based Black Bird Group, wrote on social media late Monday.\nUkraine\u2019s military said its forces are fending off Russian infantry units trying to infiltrate their defensive positions in the Donetsk region. The region\u2019s Ukrainian military command on social media Monday acknowledged that the situation remains \u201cdifficult, unpleasant and dynamic.\u201d\nElsewhere in Ukraine, a Russian missile attack on a military training facility left one soldier dead and 11 others wounded, the Ukrainian Ground Forces posted on social media."

      "text": "MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough reveals DC journalist privately shared concerns about crime while publicly denouncing Trump\u2019s plan\nMSNBC host Joe Scarborough suggested that some liberal media figures blasting President Donald Trump\u2019s federal takeover of Washington, DC were not being entirely honest about their concerns over crime in the nation\u2019s capital, on Tuesday\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\nScarborough said he found it \u201cinteresting\u201d that some reporters critically covering the Trump takeover have privately expressed concerns about their own safety.\n\u201cThis is interesting,\u201d Scarborough said.\n\u201cI actually heard from a reporter when this happened, going, \u2018Well, you know, if he doesn\u2019t overreach, this could actually be a good thing for quality of life,\u2019 etc, because in DC right now, I had this happen to my family and I had that, and they go down the list. And then I saw him tweet something completely different.\u201d\nScarborough, who said he\u2019s lived in DC for more than three decades, added that crime isn\u2019t as bad as it was two or three years ago, but it still was not a safe city.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not as safe as the nation\u2019s capital should be.\u201d\nTrump announced Monday that he would place the city\u2019s police department under direct federal control and deploy National Guard troops to \u201creestablish law, order and public safety.\u201d\nTop Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, criticized the move as unnecessary, pointing to a reported decline in homicides.\nLiberal media personalities such as CNN\u2019s Dana Bash and NBC\u2019s Jonathan Allen argued that the most violent day in recent DC history was January 6, 2021, during the Capitol riot.\nDuring the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d segment, MSNBC host Symone Sanders Townsend pushed back, saying she has lived in DC for the past decade and believes rising crime fears are largely about perception, not reality.\n\u201cThe way I\u2019ve heard DC being described this morning, is like it\u2019s a city under siege. Like it\u2019s a dangerous place, clutching your pearls, got to keep your bag under your dress when you leave the house and that is just not true,\u201d she argued, while acknowledging \u201cinstances of juvenile crime.\u201d\nShe argued that more police on the streets would not address the root causes of juvenile crime and accused Trump of amplifying public fears.\n\u201cWe need to rethink what makes cities safe in America,\u201d she added.\nScarborough countered that even lifelong Democrats are worried about their safety in Washington. He read a message from a liberal resident who refused to walk outside past 8 p.m. and whose friends had been carjacked or shot at, calling it \u201ca change from a decade ago.\u201d\n\u201cI guarantee you that\u2019s a person that has never voted for a Republican in their life,\u201d Scarborough said.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t imagined. People you know, that I know, that they love, they and their friends don\u2019t feel safe in Washington, DC.\u201d\nDuring a press conference on Monday, Trump challenged liberal journalists to be honest about crime concerns in the city.\n\u201cI understand a lot of you tend to be on the liberal side, but you don\u2019t want to get \u2014 you don\u2019t want to get mugged and raped and shot and killed,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cAnd you all know people and friends of yours that that happened. And so you can be anything you want, but you want to have safety in the streets. You want to be able to leave your apartment or your house where you live and feel safe and go into a store to buy a newspaper or buy something. And you don\u2019t have that now.\u201d"

I felt like it was my only choice,\u201d Phillips recalled.\nTrump fumed Monday that DC has been \u201covertaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people.\u201d\nThe president vowed that his administration is \u201cnot going to let it happen anymore,\u201d and will remove homeless encampments from all public places, including parks and underpasses.\nThe latest data from DC\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department show violent crime has dropped 26% in the district so far this year, compared to 2024.\nOverall crime is down 7% so far, according to MPD.\nTrump claimed Monday that the numbers were \u201cphony\u201d and promised that Attorney General Pam Bondi will be \u201clooking into that.\u201d\nThe president noted that a DC police commander was suspended last month for allegedly falsifying crime data to make trends appear more positive.\nPirro, in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, described DC as an \u201cincredibly violent area\u201d with a crime problem that is so \u201chorrific\u201d that residents have stopped reporting some of it altogether.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got here are people that are not even making complaints about the quality-of-life crimes, whether it\u2019s shoplifting or damaging property or an attempted carjacking,\u201d the DC US attorney said.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t even call the police,\u201d Pirro continued, arguing that \u201cwe\u2019re not even seeing most of the crime that\u2019s occurring.\u201d\nThe former New York district attorney and Fox News host also argued that the reason Trump\u2019s press conference announcing the DC crime crackdown was \u201cso packed\u201d is because many journalists, like Phillips, have been the victims of crime in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\u201cThose reporters in that room \u2014 and it was packed to the gills \u2014 experience crime themselves,\u201d Pirro said."

      "text": "Trump takes control of DC police, deploying National Guard in historic capital crime crackdown \u2014 and warns NYC could be next\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump announced a sweeping crime crackdown in DC on Monday, placing the city\u2019s police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to patrol the streets \u2014 while warning New York City could be next.\n\u201cI\u2019m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor \u2014 and worse. This is liberation day in DC and we\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore. We\u2019re not going to take it.\u201d\nTrump vowed to \u201cclean it up real quick,\u201d \u201clike we did on the southern border\u201d with illegal immigration.\nThe Home Rule Act, which granted DC self-governance in 1973, allows the president to assert emergency control of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) for 30 days. Congress can pass a joint resolution extending his control, which would require a bare majority in the Republican-held House and Senate.\nDocuments formalizing the takeover were transmitted to Congress Monday afternoon and DC police officials set up a meeting later in the day with White House officials to discuss the new arrangement.\nTerry Cole, the Senate-confirmed administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, will temporarily lead the 3,400-officer MPD under the supervision of Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump said.\nIt was not immediately clear how the National Guard deployment will proceed \u2014 including numbers and neighborhoods where they will be sent \u2014 but members of that force historically assist law enforcement in a supporting role and do not have the ability to make arrests.\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in an interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d Monday night, said Guardsmen from DC and \u201cother states\u201d would be deployed to the district \u201cthis week and in coming weeks\u201d to act as \u201cforce multipliers\u201d for local and federal law enforcement.\n\u201cThey will be standing right alongside our federal agents, like they were in Los Angeles. They\u2019re going to be proactive. If you take an action or a shot at them, there will be a consequence,\u201d Hegseth told host Laura Ingraham.\nThe Pentagon chief added that the troops will be allowed to \u201cinterdict\u201d and \u201ctemporarily detain\u201d individuals if they see a crime in progress and local law enforcement isn\u2019t nearby, \u201clike we did in Los Angeles.\u201d\nHegseth didn\u2019t say how many National Guard members would be activated in DC, or how long they would be patrolling the streets, describing the length of their mission as \u201cconditions-based.\u201d\nJustifying his action Monday morning, the president displayed a chart showing that DC has more murders per capita than the capital cities of cocaine-exporting Columbia, cartel-plagued Mexico, and terrorist hub Iraq.\n\u201cWe doubled up on Baghdad,\u201d Trump commented.\n\u201cYou people are victims of it too. You are reporters and I understand a lot of you tend to be on the liberal side. But you don\u2019t want to get mugged and raped and shot and killed. And you all know people, friends of yours, where that\u2019s happened.\u201d\nTrump cited many high-profile recent crimes in the capital, including the Aug. 3 attack on former Department of Government Efficiency staffer Edward Coristine, 19, during an alleged attempted carjacking and the June 30 murder of congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, in a drive-by shooting.\nTrump also mentioned the 2023 carjacking of Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), the near-fatal stabbing of an aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) the same year by a \u201cdemented lunatic\u201d and the shooting death of a three-year girl in July.\nThe president described criminals lawlessly cruising about town on unauthorized ATVs and motorbikes and said he planned to beautify the District by fixing road medians, broken marble and potholes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums too\u2026I know it\u2019s not politically correct,\u201d Trump said, teasing apparent plans to get rid of public housing in high-property-value DC.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums where they live.\u201d\nHomeless encampments will also be removed from all public places, including in parks and underpasses, the president vowed, while the US Park Police \u2014 under the control of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum \u2014 will be responsible for the removal of graffiti.\nDC officials say they won\u2019t resist\nDistrict Mayor Muriel Bowser, an elected Democrat, confirmed Monday afternoon that she would comply with the federal takeover.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to work every day to make sure it\u2019s not a complete disaster, let me put it that way,\u201d Bowser said at her own press conference, at which she called Trump\u2019s move \u201cunsettling and unprecedented.\u201d\n\u201cThe main point is this: Everybody should follow the law, the police and the community. And that\u2019s the case now, it was the case last week and it was the case the week before,\u201d she said.\nThe mayor added that she was particularly concerned about making sure that \u201call law enforcement be identifiable by uniform, a badge, a jacket, so that people know that they are law enforcement.\u201d\nTrump first ordered federal officials, including members of the FBI, DEA and Border Patrol, onto the streets of DC the night of Aug. 7-8. Photos circulating on social media and in the press showed those agents wearing clearly identifying uniforms.\nMPD Chief Pamela Smith confirmed she had a meeting set for later Monday with two federal officials, whom she did not name, about next steps.\nSmith added she was interested in receiving help to enforce outstanding warrants for criminal suspects, saying there are \u201cthings that the federal government is also very useful for.\u201d\n\u201cThis will be an opportunity for us to come together and collaborate on being able to go out and execute warrants,\u201d the police chief said.\nAhead of Trump\u2019s announcement, Bowser told MSNBC on Sunday that \u201cwe do need the federal government\u2019s help\u201d and specifically requested assistance rebuilding the city jail.\nBowser recently invoked curfews in parts of the city in a bid to keep teens off the street as early as 7 p.m., but also has claimed crime rates are going down in the city, pointing to official data.\nTrump claimed Monday that the numbers were \u201cphony\u201d and promised that Bondi will be \u201clooking into that.\u201d\nThe president noted that DC police commander Michael Pulliam, whose district included the densely populated Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights neighborhoods, was suspended last month for allegedly falsifying crime data to make trends appear more positive.\nPulliam\u2019s police union defended him and accused MPD leadership of ordering subordinates to falsify violent crime data.\nDC Police Union chairman Gregg Pemberton endorsed Trump\u2019s takeover, saying in a Fox News interview: \u201cWe completely agree with the president that crime in the District of Columbia is out of control and something needs to be done with it.\u201d\nNew York, Chicago, LA in crosshairs\nTrump announced at his press conference that other cities may be next, saying at one point that \u201cI\u2019m going to look at New York in a little while\u201d \u2014 and also name-checking Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\u201cYou look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad. New York has a problem,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting very strongly with DC, and we\u2019re going to clean it up real quick, very quickly as they say.\u201d\nTrump additionally announced plans for federal legislation that would override state laws barring judges from applying cash bail requirements to criminal defendants.\nIf necessary, Trump added, ordinary military members could be deployed to join the National Guard and the local cops.\nThe president has direct control over DC\u2019s National Guard, unlike every other unit, which is under the authority of state governors.\n\u201cWashington, DC, should be one of the safest, cleanest and most beautiful cities anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump summed up his plans, \u201cand we\u2019re going to make it that.\u201d"

They\u2019re going to be proactive. If you take an action or a shot at them, there will be a consequence,\u201d he said.\nWhen asked by host Laura Ingraham what National Guard troops will do if they see a crime in progress, Hegseth responded, \u201cThey can come alongside and assist law enforcement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if law enforcement isn\u2019t on that corner?\u201d Ingraham pressed.\n\u201cI will have their back to ensure they can take the necessary action to protect citizens of DC and to protect themselves,\u201d the defense secretary said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rogue law enforcement going on from the National Guard,\u201d Hegseth insisted. \u201cBut there\u2019s also the application of common sense.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to have the National Guard just sitting there \u2026 seeing a crime committed [and] not do something about it.\u201d\n\u201cYou can help somebody interdict, temporarily detain, like we did in Los Angeles, and hand over to law enforcement those types of things,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe National Guard can be trained to do that.\u201d\nPresident Trump activated 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marine service members to California in June amid violent anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles.\nBy July 1, nearly all of the National Guard members and Marines had been released, with around 300 still in the city.\nHegseth did not say how many Guardsmen would be activated in DC, or how long they will patrol the city.\n\u201cI would call this \u2018conditions-based,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI would say it\u2019s a situation where we\u2019re here to support law enforcement, and the more we can free them up to do their job, the more effective they can be.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know \u2013 weeks, months? What will it take? That\u2019s the president\u2019s call, but we\u2019re going to be there for him to execute as swiftly as possible.\u201d\nThe president has direct control over DC\u2019s National Guard, unlike every other unit, which is under the authority of state governors.\nTrump signed an executive order Monday mobilizing the DC National Guard as part of an effort aimed at \u201crestoring law and order in the District of Columbia.\u201d\n\u201cWashington, DC, should be one of the safest, cleanest and most beautiful cities anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump said of his plans, \u201cand we\u2019re going to make it that.\u201d"
