In the U.S., softer employment data and the upcoming payrolls have spurred a rally in Treasuries and gold, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rise on an antitrust win for Alphabet. The dollar weakens against major peers, and oil falls after OPEC considers boosting output. Meanwhile, China’s yuan has strengthened against the dollar, suggesting a policy move to support domestic demand and negotiate with Washington.",
