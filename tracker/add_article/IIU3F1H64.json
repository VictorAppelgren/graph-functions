      "summary": "Florida announced it will eliminate all vaccine mandates for children, sparking criticism from public health experts and prompting a patchwork of state and regional vaccine guidelines. The move follows a broader shift under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has fired CDC officials and cut mRNA vaccine funding, fueling a national debate over vaccine policy and federal authority. State alliances in California, Oregon, Washington, and New England are forming independent guidelines in response to perceived federal overreach. The controversy highlights growing polarization over public health mandates and the potential impact on disease outbreaks and public trust.",
