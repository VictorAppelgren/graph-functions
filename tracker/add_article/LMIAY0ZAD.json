      "summary": "SpaceX is contesting Virginia's plan to deploy fiber Internet, arguing that federal grant money should favor Starlink instead. The company is seeking $60 million in funding, claiming that Virginia's proposal wastes taxpayer money by prioritizing fiber over satellite technology. Virginia's plan aims to connect the remaining 133,500 unserved locations with a mix of technologies, while the Trump administration's recent changes to the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program could potentially direct billions to Starlink.",
