  "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Is Selling Nvidia and AMD for a Cutting-Edge Company With an Addressable Market in Excess of $200 Billion",
  "description": "Appaloosa's billionaire investor has swapped out two artificial intelligence (AI) hardware goliaths for a rapidly growing company in the fintech arena.",
  "content": "Over a 12-month period ended March 31, Tepper and his team completely exited 14 holdings and reduced Appaloosa's stake in 19 other positions. Among these moves, the two most noteworthy are:\n\nHowever, Tepper's trading activity over the previous year (April 1, 2024\u2013March 31, 2025) has been eyebrow-raising, to say the least. Based on 13Fs, he's been a persistent seller of two of Wall Street's most-popular artificial intelligence (AI) stocks , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). At the same time, he's chosen to buy shares of a cutting-edge company whose total addressable market is estimated at $205 billion.\n\nBeyond Warren Buffett, Appaloosa's billionaire chief David Tepper tends to be one of the most-followed fund managers. Tepper's willingness to dive into popular growth stocks has resonated with investors during the current bull market.\n\nWhile there's no substitute to quarterly earnings reports, knowing which stocks and trends Wall Street's leading asset managers are buying into or selling out of is equally valuable.\n\nFor example, the sheer abundance of Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission might go unnoticed by investors. A 13F is a required filing no later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management. It provides a snapshot for investors of which stocks Wall Street's smartest fund managers are buying and selling.\n\nBetween near-daily economic data releases and the six-week period each quarter (\"earnings season\") where many of Wall Street's most-influential business reveal their operating results, keeping up on market-moving news events can be challenging. Once in a while, something of importance can fall through the cracks.\n\nMeanwhile, Appaloosa's chief bought shares of a leading digital payment solutions company for the first time in four years.\n\nBillionaire David Tepper completely exited his fund's position in Advanced Micro Devices and reduced his stake in Nvidia by 93% -- and profit-taking might not be the only reason for selling.\n\nQuarterly-filed Form 13Fs offer a way for investors to closely track the buying and selling activity of Wall Street's leading fund managers.\n\nOn paper, everything would seem to be going great for these developers of graphics processing unit (GPUs). Nvidia's Hopper (H100) and Blackwell GPUs hold a majority of AI-accelerated data center market share, while AMD's Instinct series chips are ramping up and aiming to siphon away market share from Nvidia. For more than two years, businesses have been spending aggressively on AI-data center infrastructure to gain first-mover advantages over their peers.\n\nNvidia has been particularly adept at growing its sales and keeping customers loyal thanks to its CUDA software platform. CUDA is what developers use to maximize the computing potential of their Nvidia GPUs, as well as to train large language models.\n\nHowever, David Tepper's selling activity in AI hardware stocks was likely undertaken with a purpose.\n\nOne possibility is that Tepper and his team were (pardon the pun) taking their chips off the table after a sizable run-up in the shares of both Nvidia and AMD. The average holding period for Appaloosa's securities is two years and five months, which suggests Tepper isn't shy about locking in gains when presented with the opportunity to do so. The concern is there may be more to this story than just profit-taking.\n\nArguably the biggest worry with the AI revolution is that it'll follow historical precedent. For more than three decades, every game-changing technology has worked its way through an early stage bubble that eventually burst. Put another way, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technology would earn wide adoption and become useful. It takes time for next-big-thing innovations to mature, and artificial intelligence doesn't look as if it'll be the exception.\n\nIf an AI bubble were to form and burst, AI hardware stocks like Nvidia and AMD would undoubtedly feel the pinch.\n\nCompetitive pressures are also a concern (more so for Nvidia than AMD). Though most eyes tend to be on external competitors developing AI-GPUs, internal competition is possibly an even bigger story.\n\nMany of Wall Street's most-influential companies are internally developing AI chips to use in their data centers. Even though this hardware can't compete with Nvidia and/or AMD on a compute basis, it'll be considerably cheaper and more readily available. In other words, it's a recipe for less AI-GPU scarcity, weaker pricing power, and lower gross margin for Nvidia and AMD.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Tepper added 10 new stocks to Appaloosa's nearly $8.4 billion investment portfolio over the last year (excluding options). Arguably one of the more attractive additions is that of fintech juggernaut Block (NYSE: XYZ).\n\nDuring the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tepper's fund held in excess of 400,000 shares of Block. But by the end of the first quarter of 2021, every share had been sent to the chopping block. Following a four-year hiatus, Block stock is back in Appaloosa's investment portfolio, with Tepper adding 75,000 shares during the March-ended quarter.\n\nBlock has two distinct operating segments -- Square ecosystem and Cash App -- each of which brings a sizable addressable market to the table.\n\nThe Square ecosystem is Block's foundational operating division, with this segment sporting an estimated addressable market of $130 billion, based on a research note released in November 2024 by Piper Sandler analyst Arvind Ramnani.\n\nSquare is the merchant-focused portion of Block's business that's designed to facilitate digital/mobile payments, as well as provide merchants with payment solutions and data analytics. During the fourth quarter of 2020, gross payment volume (GPV) totaled $29.4 billion for the Square ecosystem. But as of the second quarter of 2025, GPV topped $64.2 billion.\n\nThe rapid expansion in GPV on Square's payment networks is a function of sustained double-digit growth in international markets, as well as a higher percentage of GPV originating from larger businesses (those with $500,000 or more in annual GPV).\n\nThe other key puzzle piece for Block is its mobile payment service known as Cash App. Ramnani views Cash App as being a $75 billion addressable opportunity for Block. When combined with the Square ecosystem, Block is staring down an estimated $205 billion tailwind.\n\nAt the end of 2020, Cash App had 36 million monthly active customers. But as of the midpoint of 2025, there are now 57 million monthly transacting active users. Cash App is a higher margin opportunity for Block than the Square ecosystem, with gross profit per Cash App user often heavily outpacing the cost to acquire Cash App actives.\n\nThough both of Block's operating segments are more than a decade old, they're arguably still early in their respective expansions. Even with competition picking up in the digital payments arena, Block appears well-positioned to capitalize on a sustained double-digit growth opportunity.\n\nDo the experts think Block is a buy right now?\n\nThe Motley Fool\u2019s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities. They\u2019ve just revealed their 10 best stocks to buy now \u2014 did Block make the list?\n\nWhen our Stock Advisor analyst team has a stock recommendation, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is up 1,060% vs. just 182% for the S&P \u2014 that is beating the market by 877.59%!*\n\nImagine if you were a Stock Advisor member when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $653,427!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,119,863!*\n\nThe 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years. Don't miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nSean Williams has positions in Block.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

Following a four-year hiatus, Block stock is back in Appaloosa's investment portfolio, with Tepper adding 75,000 shares during the March-ended quarter.\nBlock has two distinct operating segments -- Square ecosystem and Cash App -- each of which brings a sizable addressable market to the table.\nThe Square ecosystem is Block's foundational operating division, with this segment sporting an estimated addressable market of $130 billion, based on a research note released in November 2024 by Piper Sandler analyst Arvind Ramnani.\nSquare is the merchant-focused portion of Block's business that's designed to facilitate digital/mobile payments, as well as provide merchants with payment solutions and data analytics. During the fourth quarter of 2020, gross payment volume (GPV) totaled $29.4 billion for the Square ecosystem. But as of the second quarter of 2025, GPV topped $64.2 billion.\nThe rapid expansion in GPV on Square's payment networks is a function of sustained double-digit growth in international markets, as well as a higher percentage of GPV originating from larger businesses (those with $500,000 or more in annual GPV).\nThe other key puzzle piece for Block is its mobile payment service known as Cash App. Ramnani views Cash App as being a $75 billion addressable opportunity for Block. When combined with the Square ecosystem, Block is staring down an estimated $205 billion tailwind.\nAt the end of 2020, Cash App had 36 million monthly active customers. But as of the midpoint of 2025, there are now 57 million monthly transacting active users. Cash App is a higher margin opportunity for Block than the Square ecosystem, with gross profit per Cash App user often heavily outpacing the cost to acquire Cash App actives.\nThough both of Block's operating segments are more than a decade old, they're arguably still early in their respective expansions. Even with competition picking up in the digital payments arena, Block appears well-positioned to capitalize on a sustained double-digit growth opportunity."

  "argos_summary": "David Tepper's Appaloosa Management has significantly reduced its holdings in popular AI stocks Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, selling 93% of its Nvidia shares and completely exiting its position in AMD. Tepper has instead invested in fintech company Block, which has a combined addressable market of approximately $205 billion from its Square ecosystem and Cash App services. This shift may reflect Tepper's strategy to lock in profits from AI stocks amid concerns of a potential market bubble and increasing competition in the AI hardware space.",
