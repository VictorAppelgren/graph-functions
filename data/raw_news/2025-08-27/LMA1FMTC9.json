We focus on factors that matter most to sports bettors, from secure banking to competitive odds. By examining each site in-depth, we give you a clear picture of what to expect from these platforms.\nBanking Options\nWe look for offshore sportsbooks that offer secure and convenient banking methods. Whether you prefer credit cards, e-wallets or cryptocurrencies, we check each option to make sure it\u2019s reliable. Fast payouts are a priority, so we test withdrawal speeds to confirm you can access your winnings without hassle. Only sites with trustworthy banking services are rated well by our team.\nUser Experience\nA well-designed online sportsbook makes betting easy. We evaluate each site\u2019s layout and ease of use, focusing on how quickly you can find games, place bets and access important information. A user-friendly platform ensures a smooth experience, so we prioritize sites that provide easy navigation and a simple interface. Sports bettors should feel comfortable exploring and placing bets without any issues.\nMobile Compatibility\nWith mobile betting becoming more popular, we examine each sportsbook\u2019s mobile experience closely. Whether through an app or a mobile-optimized website, we check for responsive design, functionality and ease of navigation. A good mobile platform lets you place bets on the go with minimal effort. Our top picks ensure you can access quick odds and place bets smoothly from your smartphone or tablet.\nCustomer Support\nGood customer support is essential for a reliable offshore sportsbook. We value sites that offer multiple support options, like live chat, email and phone assistance. Prompt responses and helpful representatives are a must. The best sportsbooks provide dependable customer service to handle any issues that may arise, so you can bet with peace of mind knowing help is available when you need it.\nCompetitive Odds\nOffering competitive odds is a key factor for any online sportsbook. We compare the odds for major sports, such as football, basketball and baseball, across multiple sites. A site with strong odds gives sports bettors better returns and more value for their money. In addition to standard bets, we check the variety in bet types, ensuring each site covers everything from single bets to complex options like parlays.\nRange of Betting Options\nA diverse range of sportsbook betting options adds to the enjoyment of online wagering. We look for sportsbooks that offer various types, from moneyline bets and spreads to futures, props and totals. Offshore sportsbooks that provide options for niche sports and events beyond the major leagues are ranked higher. A wide variety gives sports bettors more choices and flexibility, allowing them to try different strategies.\nOnline Casino\nWe prioritize online sportsbooks that feature a dedicated online casino section. Platforms offering slots, table games, poker and live dealer games give players more ways to gamble beyond sports betting. We focus on sites that deliver quality casino options alongside sports, providing a complete betting and gaming experience.\nBonuses and Promotions\nBonuses and promotions add extra value for sports bettors. We assess each online sportsbook\u2019s welcome offers, reload bonuses and ongoing promotions. We pay attention to the size of these offers, as well as any conditions that may impact their value, like wagering requirements. Fair and generous promotions make a site more appealing, so we prioritize offshore sportsbooks that deliver value through these incentives.\nBy focusing on these factors, we aim to guide you toward the best offshore sites offering security, convenience and a strong betting experience. Check our ratings to find the best options for your needs.\nHow to Place a Bet at an Offshore Sportsbook\nAt most offshore sportsbooks, the sign-up process is straightforward. If you\u2019re unsure where to begin, here are the essential steps to get you started with top online sportsbooks.\n-\n1\nPick a Reputable Sportsbook\nYou can check out reviews like ours or do some research to find the best options for US players. The main goal is to pick a site that delivers a secure, enjoyable experience. -\n2\nClaim a Bonus\nSelect from available promotions and deposit match offers. It\u2019s recommended to use crypto if available since generally speaking mobile apps offer larger bonuses if using crypto. -\n3\nDeposit Funds\nOnce your account is set up, proceed to the cashier section to deposit funds. You\u2019ll be able to choose from various payment methods, including cryptocurrencies and credit cards. Remember, if you\u2019re aiming for a welcome promo, ensure your deposit meets the qualifying criteria. -\n4\nPlace a Bet\nIn the sportsbook section, select the bets you want to place. Add them to your bet slip, enter the amount you wish to wager and confirm your bet. The bet slip will display the potential payout based on the odds and your stake.\nBy following these steps, you\u2019ll be well on your way to enjoying the exciting world of sports betting.\nThe State of Online Sports Betting Across the U.S.\nOffshore sportsbooks operate outside the United States in regions where online gambling has existed for decades. These sites are properly licensed and regulated, and there are no federal laws in the U.S. that prohibit using them.\nSince the repeal of PASPA in 2018, U.S. states regulate betting individually. In states with no regulated options, like California and Texas, many players rely on offshore sites while waiting for a resolution.\nStates like Missouri and Florida have limitations that make it harder to bet, so sports bettors turn to online sportsbooks for wider betting markets and better odds. Since offshore sportsbooks operate outside U.S. jurisdiction, they aren\u2019t subject to state gambling laws but are licensed and regulated where they are based.\nOffshore Betting News\nIs iGaming Coming to Virginia?\nOnline casino gambling has been discussed in Virginia\u2019s legislature, but recent iGaming bills have failed to gain traction. However, a meeting of the Joint Subcommittee\nBetMGM Redesigns App Just in Time for Football Season\nA top mobile sportsbook has launched a redesigned layout, offering a sleeker and more user-friendly experience for sports bettors on the go.\nTop NFL Pick\u2019em Pools for 2025\nThe Bookmakers Review Pick\u2019Em Pool kicks off in Week 1 of the NFL season on Thursday, September 4th. Join this FREE NFL pick\u2019em pool for\nWhat Online Sportsbooks Offer\nFind a top betting sites that cater to your needs.\nThere are some features to keep in mind when comparing online betting sites to make sure you have the best experience. We explore them below.\nTrustworthy Reputation\nA trustworthy sportsbook keeps things above board and provides peace of mind, so it\u2019s critical for you to find an offshore sportsbook you can trust. Look for platforms that are transparent in their dealings, have been operating for a good amount of time and are licensed under respected jurisdictions.\nGood Customer Satisfaction\nCheck online reviews, forums and community discussions to gauge customer satisfaction. An online sportsbook with happy customers is likely doing something right.\nPay attention to what the reviews say about customer support, in particular. If you run into issues with your sportsbook, you want knowledgeable representatives that you can count on.\nCompetitive Odds\nBetter odds mean more profits for you when you win. Offshore sportsbooks often offer better odds due to lower operational costs, making them a smart choice for value-conscious sports bettors. There are also more opportunities to find reduced juice and boosted odds.\nGenerous Welcome Bonuses\nOnline betting sites offer attractive promotions to new players. When you sign up, you can get free money (deposit matches), free bets and other perks. You want to find a sportsbook that strikes a balance between a generous offer and reasonable terms. A key tip is that most sites give higher offers to crypto players.\nHigh Betting Limits\nOffshore sportsbooks are more welcoming of the high rollers, offering generous betting limits that invite sharp bettors. They have more diverse limits overall, maintaining lower minimum and maximum limits to suit any strategy.\nPayment Options and Payout Speed\nHaving a range of deposit methods allows you to fund your account in the way that suits you best. Traditional methods like credit/debit cards and bank transfers are always handy, but alternative methods like crypto or e-wallets can offer significant benefits.\nSimple KYC Process\nThe most trustworthy sportsbooks strike a balance between comprehensive security and convenience. The KYC process should be straightforward, requesting only necessary information and the verification should be conducted in a timely manner.\nRemember, a well-executed KYC procedure not only protects each online sportsbook but also assures the bettor of their security and protection.\nBenefits of Offshore Betting\nOne of the biggest advantages of offshore betting sites is their ability to offer better odds than regular sportsbooks. They often have lower overhead costs, which means they can offer better odds, promos and other perks.\nThere are tons of benefits to using them, and we look at those in depth below.\n- Superior Odds: They provide better value for your bets. Without the same regulatory fees, taxes and compliance costs as domestic books, they can offer more attractive odds, giving you the potential for higher returns.\n- Better Promotions: Compared to locally regulated sportsbooks, these operators provide players with more generous promos, a wider variety of promos and more attractive loyalty rewards.\n- Extensive Market Options: They offer a wide variety of betting markets, covering popular sports and major leagues, niche markets and even college sports.\n- Global Accessibility: Unlike sites in the US and Canada, that require location-tracking software, these platforms can operate without these restrictions. This lets you place your bets from anywhere with ease.\n- Esports Betting: Offshore betting sites offer a wide range of esports betting markets that you can\u2019t find on local sites.\n- Political Betting: You can also turn to offshore sites for betting on political events. US-based sportsbooks often avoid political markets due to influence concerns, whereas offshore sportsbooks allow you to turn your political predictions into cash.\n- Increased Privacy: Offshore sites employ robust security protocols to protect your information. For those seeking financial privacy, many offshore sportsbooks now offer crypto deposits.\nBetting on Politics: Trends, Odds, and Legality\nStunning Upsets in Political Betting\nPolitical betting online has seen incredible upsets, creating huge payouts for savvy sports bettors on offshore betting sites. In 2016, bookmakers and online prediction markets significantly misjudged outcomes, heavily favoring \u201cRemain\u201d in Britain\u2019s Brexit referendum and Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential race. Both underdogs won, rewarding contrarian bettors handsomely. Notably, one bettor famously placed a $5 million wager on Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election\u2014the largest political bet ever reported.\nElection Seasons Drive Betting Popularity\nEvery four years, the political spotlight turns into a high-stakes betting arena and the 2024 U.S. presidential election proved just how explosive that combination can be. Offshore sportsbooks saw a tidal wave of wagers as Donald Trump faced off against Kamala Harris in what became one of the most polarizing, unpredictable elections in recent memory. Platforms like Polymarket shattered records, with political betting volume topping $3.3 billion blowing past previous highs and turning political speculation into a betting frenzy.\nThe draw? A volatile news cycle, ever-shifting polls, and the thrill of turning political insight into profit. For many, betting on politics isn\u2019t just a gamble it\u2019s a way to stay engaged, voice their take on the outcome, and, hopefully, cash in while doing it. As mainstream sportsbooks in the U.S. remain off-limits for political action, offshore betting sites have become the go-to alternative for bettors seeking full access to political markets.\nIs Betting On Politics at Offshore Sportsbooks Legal?\nShort answer? In the U.S., no, not through regulated sportsbooks. Political betting remains off the table due to a mix of federal laws and state-level restrictions. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the rise of political wagering. Instead, it\u2019s pushed it offshore.\nOffshore sportsbooks, or betting sites operating outside U.S. jurisdiction have stepped in to meet the demand, offering expansive political betting markets that cover everything from presidential outcomes to state-level races and international elections. These offshore sites aren\u2019t bound by U.S. laws, which gives them the freedom to host odds and accept bets on political events that U.S.-based books simply can\u2019t touch.\nWhile legal experts often describe offshore betting as existing in a gray area, the reality is this: thousands of Americans use these sites regularly, drawn by their accessibility, odds variety, and real-time market movement. That said, bettors should choose offshore sportsbooks with a track record of trust, fast payouts, and secure platforms because once you\u2019re outside the regulated system, you\u2019re on your own.\nPolitical Betting News\nDonald Trump\u2019s Current Odds for Winning the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize\nDonald Trump has the second-best odds to win the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize at multiple sportsbooks. His push for peace in Ukraine and Gaza could\nCanadian Elections: Trump Redux Up North?\nThe Canadian federal election has seen some twists and turns. Are the politics odds as far off as they were in the United States?\nWho Will Be the Republican and Democratic Nominees?\nThe race for 2028 is taking shape with J.D. Vance as the GOP favorite and Gavin Newsom and Josh Shapiro leading Democratic contenders. Michelle Obama\nOffshore Sportsbooks Do Not Report Winnings to the IRS\nOne of the biggest advantages of offshore sportsbooks is the financial privacy they provide. Unlike U.S.-regulated betting sites, these operators do not report player winnings to the IRS, allowing offshore bettors to manage their tax obligations without automatic oversight.\nFederal Taxes on Gambling Winnings\nThe IRS classifies gambling winnings as taxable income, whether they come from a domestic sportsbook or an offshore betting site. While offshore sportsbooks do not report your winnings, it remains each bettor\u2019s responsibility to declare gambling income when filing taxes.\n- Regardless of where you place your bets, winnings from any online sportsbooks are considered taxable income and should be reported when filing your taxes.\n- Offshore sportsbooks do not provide official tax forms like U.S.-regulated sites (such as Form W-2G), nor do they automatically withhold taxes on large payouts.\nWhy Offshore Sportsbooks Offer Greater Privacy\nRegulated sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings automatically report winnings over $600 to the IRS, issuing Form W-2G to players. This can create tax implications even for sports bettors who may not have withdrawn or profited significantly over the year. Offshore sportsbooks, however, do not submit tax documentation, providing an extra layer of financial discretion.\nAlthough offshore sportsbooks do not report to the IRS, tax laws still require offshore bettors to report gambling income. Many players value the financial privacy that offshore betting provides, especially given the potential for reporting errors and tax complications with regulated sportsbooks. Privacy remains a key advantage of offshore betting, particularly when it comes to tax obligations.\nWagering Requirements for Popular Promos\nBonuses offered by the best online sportsbooks often come with a catch. To decide which promo will give you the most bang for your buck, it\u2019s essential to take a step back and consider the terms tied to each one.\n- Rollover: Requires you to bet the promo amount (and sometimes the deposit amount) a certain number of times before you can withdraw.\n- Minimum Odds: Only bets with certain odds count towards fulfilling the requirements.\n- Time Limit: Requirements must be met before a certain time or the promo gets forfeited.\n- Type of Bet Restriction: You may only be able to use the funds on certain markets.\n- Maximum Win Limit: The maximum amount you can win.\n- Eligible Sports: Some bonuses at offshore sportsbooks are only applicable for certain sports.\n- One at a Time: You must complete the wagering requirements for one offer before claiming another.\n- Payment Method Restrictions: Some bonuses are tied to a specific payment method, like crypto.\nIt\u2019s important to read the terms and conditions of each promo code carefully to understand the specific wagering requirements and other restrictions that apply. This will help you evaluate the true value and decide how best to use it.\nRegulated vs. Offshore Sportsbooks\nThe best offshore sportsbooks for US players offer distinct advantages compared to locally-legal sportsbooks. Below is a comparison highlighting the differences between these two types of online sportsbooks.\n| Feature | Offshore Sportsbooks | Regulated Sportsbooks |\n|---|---|---|\n| Welcome Bonuses | $1000 max | $500 max |\n| Odds | -108 average | -110 |\n| Crypto | Accepts cryptocurrencies | Does not accept cryptocurrencies |\n| Dispute Resolution | Dispute mediation with BMR | State board mediation |\n| Tax Reporting | No IRS reporting | Reports winnings over $600 to IRS |\n| Online Casino | Live dealer games (female dealers) | Not offered |\nWho regulates offshore sportsbooks?\nOffshore sportsbooks are overseen by their local licensing authorities instead of US regulators. They comply with the rules set by the licensing authorities in their jurisdictions. This regulation keeps players safe and ensures secure transactions and fair games.\nThese offshore sportsbooks operate out of countries where online gambling is legal. The top-tier names on our list of online sportsbooks, like BetOnline and Bovada, are frequently hailed as some of the best online betting sites. These sites operate under the rules and regulations of their home jurisdictions, such as Costa Rica and Panama.\nGambling licenses are issued by established agencies like Cura\u00e7ao eGaming, used by Bovada and BetUS. Many of the best offshore sportsbooks hold licenses in other countries, too, such as Malta and Antigua.\nOffshore Sportsbook Banking Methods\nEnjoy a hassle-free experience with a top offshore sportsbook.\nMost offshore sportsbooks make it easy for you to move your money. Here\u2019s a look at some of the payment methods you can expect to find at the top online betting sites:\n- Credit and Debit Cards (Visa/Mastercard): Widely accepted and easy to use. Good for quick deposits, but may have fees for withdrawals. Keep an eye on the minimum deposit and maximum withdrawal limits. Some offshore sportsbooks also accept less popular options, like Discover and American Express.\n- E-Wallets (PayPal, Google Pay, Neteller, Stripe): These are digital wallets for moving money online. They\u2019re convenient and come with lower fees than traditional payment methods. Withdrawal times can be a bit longer, so plan accordingly.\n- Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin): This is becoming a popular option at many offshore sportsbooks. Crypto transactions are fast and usually have lower fees. They also offer more privacy. Plus, many sportsbooks offer special bonuses for crypto players.\n- Bank Wires: Wire transfers are typically ideal for transferring larger amounts. Bank wires typically have lower fees for deposits but might charge for withdrawals. They are slower than other methods, so it\u2019s not the best choice if you need quick access to your funds.\nFor fast and easy transactions, credit/debit cards and e-wallets are great, but watch out for potential fees. Choose the method that aligns with your needs and preferences at offshore sportsbooks.\nFor privacy and lower fees, cryptocurrencies are the way to go. If you\u2019re moving large sums, sticking with traditional methods like bank wires could be more efficient despite being slower.\nExplore the Top Online Betting Apps\nWhen you get into online sports betting, one of the first things you\u2019ll notice is how popular mobile betting has become. Offshore sportsbooks can\u2019t offer traditional mobile apps, so they optimize their sites to work just like an app on any device.\nIt\u2019s easy for you to fund your sportsbook account, browse through sports markets and even play casino games. You can place and track bets with a convenient mobile bet slip, too. Using a phone or tablet, you can get the full desktop experience from anywhere.\nWhether you\u2019re using an iOS or Android device, all of the offshore sportsbooks we\u2019ve reviewed are designed to provide a great online betting experience on all of your devices. No matter which online betting site you choose, you can enjoy the convenience of mobile betting today.\nBookmakersReview FAQs\nWhat makes BookmakersReview a leading authority in sports betting?\nBookmakersReview (BMR) has been a trusted name in offshore sports betting since 1999.
