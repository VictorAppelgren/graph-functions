On Saturday, July 19, Lin, boyfriend David Hua and two friends had stopped to look at giant sequoias along Tuolumne Grove, a popular hiking trail, when there was a loud cracking sound, Hua told SFGate, the first outlet to report on Lin's death. \u201cTwo to three seconds later, branches fell out of the sky,\u201d said Hua, who did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment. \u201cOne big branch struck Angela, and then there were a bunch of smaller ones directly behind me.\u201d When the man opened his eyes, he saw his girlfriend on the ground as blood pooled around her head. While Hua called 911 and performed CPR until a park ranger was able to assist, he said that emergency responders told him that Lin most likely died as soon as she was struck by the branch, SFGate reported. In a statement shared with PEOPLE, the Tuolumne County Sheriff\u2019s Office says a report was received that Saturday around 5:50 p.m. local time of \"a fatal incident in the Tuolumne County portion of the park involving a hiker who had been struck by falling portions of a tree.\" Investigators from the coroner division of the sheriff's office then responded to the Mather Ranger Office to take possession of the victim's body, which officials confirm was Lin. Her death was ruled accidental and a result of \"blunt injuries,\" the sheriff's office said. A spokesperson for Yosemite National Park says an investigation into the incident is ongoing and no further information is available.
