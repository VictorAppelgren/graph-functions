      "text": "Jimmy Fallon, John Oliver, Jon Stewart, Seth Meyers and other stars take over \u2018The Late Show\u2019 audience to support Stephen Colbert after cancellation news\nA slew of comedy\u2019s biggest stars \u2014 including Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, John Oliver, Jon Stewart, Adam Sandler and more \u2014 took over the audience of \u201cThe Late Show\u201d with Stephen Colbert Monday night in a show of support after news of the talk show\u2019s cancellation mere days after being nominated for multiple Emmys.\nThe battalion of comics, including several competing late-night talk show hosts, headed over to the rival Ed Sullivan Theater to speak out against CBS\u2019s decision to axe the top-rated talk show.\nThe cameos began when Colbert brought out \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic and Lin-Manuel Miranda to play some music to cheer up heartbroken fans.\nThe pair played Coldplay\u2019s \u201cViva la Vida\u201d \u2014 a bit poking fun at the Coldplay concert CEO cheating scandal \u2014 as the cameras scanned the audience and landed on several famous spectators.\nAndy Cohen stole a smooch from Anderson Cooper; Fallon and Meyers exchanged high-fives while drinking beers; Sandler, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog (and Robert Smigel), and Christopher McDonald ate fried food in the stands; and Oliver and Stewart threw an excited fit over being on camera.\nThe skit ended with the camera panning over to an animated President Trump holding a Paramount sign before the Trump cartoon ducks, like Astronomer CEO Andy Byron did when caught with alleged HR chief mistress Kristin Cabot on camera at a Coldplay concert last week.\nColbert took a shot at Paramount \u2014 CBS\u2019s parent company \u2014 last week when he slammed the $16 million settlement it brokered with Trump over the station\u2019s controversial \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview of Kamala Harris during the 2024 election campaign.\nLess than three days later, the company announced it was cancelling \u201cThe Late Night Show\u201d after May 2026.\nDuring Monday night\u2019s episode, Colbert, who took over the show following the legendary David Letterman\u2019s departure in 2015, didn\u2019t shy away from the topic of his cancellation \u2014 using his monologue to bash the network\u2019s decision.\n\u201cFolks, I\u2019m gonna say it. Cancel culture has gone too far,\u201d he joked at the beginning of the show.\nThe CBS mainstay, while being critically acclaimed, reportedly started losing upwards of $40 million annually off of an already steep $100 million budget per season.\n\u201c$40 million\u2019s a big number. I could see us losing $24 million, but where would Paramount have possibly spent the other $16 million? Oh yeah,\u201d Colbert added, referring to the settlement.\nThe comedian said he doesn\u2019t hold ill will towards CBS, but questioned the reasoning for his show\u2019s cancellation.\n\u201cHow could it purely be a financial decision if \u2018The Late Show\u2019 is number one in ratings?\u201d he asked.\nJimmy Kimmel, whose own ABC late-night show is currently on hiatus, was notably missing from \u201cThe Late Show\u201d stands but had earlier shared a message in support of his competitor on social media.\n\u201cLove you, Stephen. F\u2014k you and all your Sheldons, CBS,\u201d Kimmel wrote on Instagram last Thursday.\nMonday night\u2019s guests, actor Dave Franco and Golden Globe winner Sandra Oh, also offered their praise of Colbert and sorrow at the show\u2019s cancellation."

      "text": "Stephen A. Smith hits back at Michelle Obama, \u2018still \u2026 salty\u2019 at her Trump vote comments\nStephen A. Smith has hit back at Michelle Obama.\nThe former First Lady took a jab at Smith\u2019s employer, ESPN, name-dropping the longtime host and saying the network\u2019s shows were like watching reality television, namely \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a sociological study. They think that sports is better reality TV, I\u2019m like, \u2018It\u2019s the same thing.\u2019 If I listen to ESPN for an hour, it\u2019s like watching the \u2018Real Housewives of Atlanta,\u2019 you know?\u201d Obama said on her brother Craig\u2019s \u201cIMO\u201d podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s the same drama, and they\u2019re yelling at each other, and they don\u2019t get along, you know? I mean, Stephen A. Smith, he\u2019s just like every other. . . .\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s why I\u2019m like, \u2018what\u2019s the difference?\u2019 It\u2019s just, you know, it\u2019s just sociological drama,\u201d added Obama. \u201cI mean, the fact that people over seasons of working still can\u2019t get along. They still have the same arguments, you know, and it\u2019s not just women. But this happens in sports, too. I find it fascinating.\u201d\nThose comments found their way to Smith himself, and he used them as an opportunity not necessarily to respond back, but voice his opinion on one of her strategies while campaigning for Kamala Harris last year.\n\u201cWhen you were campaigning on behalf of the former Vice President Kamala Harris \u2026 you said a vote for [President Donald] Trump was a vote against you and a vote against y\u2019all as women. I want to say for the record \u2013 I took major offense to that.\u201d Smith admitted.\n\u201cI think to this day is the only thing that I didn\u2019t like that you said, I didn\u2019t appreciate it. Because there\u2019s so many things that go into deciding where your vote is going to go. For some people, it\u2019s all about the economy. For others, it\u2019s all about national security.\n\u201cFor some people, it is immigration. For some people, it\u2019s safety in the streets of America. Long before they think about pro-choice or pro-life.\u201d\nSmith reiterated that he voted for Harris and \u201cwouldn\u2019t vote for Trump,\u201d but \u201cwasn\u2019t excited\u201d how casting his vote for the former vice president \u201cparticularly after I heard about some of the shenanigans that the Democratic Party was engaging in leading up to the election.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m talking specifically to you, Madam First Lady. You are not just beloved, you are revered. You are sensational in so many ways. I\u2019ve been on the record on this show and many others stating had you run for president, you would have beat Trump. I still believe that \u2026 I believe if your husband elected to come back, he would beat Trump. That\u2019s my personal belief . . .\u201d Smith continued.\nSmith then got into Obama\u2019s comments about ESPN, saying he disagreed with those as well.\n\u201cSo this doesn\u2019t have anything to do with what you were talking about, how sports and reality TV mirror one another, even though we would beg to differ. Because a lot of things on reality TV are made-up situations and scenarios to provoke reactions and all of that stuff.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at sports, that\u2019s live entertainment, and you\u2019re actually competing against one another is big time. No, reality TV is not like that. You\u2019re so wrong about that, about that assertion, but that\u2019s neither here nor there. . . .\n\u201cYou will never hear me utter a negative word about you, but I respectfully disagreed and still remain pretty salty about what you said about us,\u201d Smith said, adding that he felt Obama \u201csort of blackmail[ed] us emotionally into trying to compel us to vote one way or another.\u201d\nPerhaps we may get another episode of this apparent Obama-Smith beef."

You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21. Terms Pertaining to Certain Third Party Content, Data and Information Providers and Mobile Application Platforms.\n21.1 AP Material. By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications. If you access the Services through a mobile application or other type of third party platform, the applicable End User License Agreement for the platform through which you downloaded the mobile application may apply in addition to these Terms and you agree that you are subject to such terms in addition to these Terms."

      "text": "CBS cancels \u2018Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u2019 citing \u2018financial decision\u2019\nStephen Colbert\u2019s beloved late-night show is coming to an end.\nCBS announced its plan to cancel \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d after the next TV season in a statement on Thursday, July 17.\nThe network claimed it was \u201cpurely a financial decision.\u201d\n\u201cWe consider Stephen Colbert irreplaceable and will retire \u2018The Late Show\u2019 franchise in May of 2026,\u201d CBS executives\u2019 statement read. \u201cWe are proud that Stephen called CBS home. He and the broadcast will be remembered in the pantheon of greats that graced late night television.\u201d\n\u201cThis is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show\u2019s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount,\u201d the announcement concluded.\nColbert addressed the situation during the taping of Thursday\u2019s show at the Ed Sullivan Theatre in New York, sharing that he learned the news on Wednesday evening.\nDelivering the news from his iconic \u201cLate Show\u201d desk, the television host said he was appreciative to the network for giving him a platform.\nAs the audience booed, Colbert chimed in, \u201cYeah. I share your feelings.\u201d\nHe continued to explain, \u201cI\u2019m not being replaced, this is all just going away.\u201d\n\u201cI do want to say that the folks at CBS have been great partners. I\u2019m so grateful to the Tiffany Network for giving me this chair and this beautiful theater to call home. And of course, I\u2019m grateful to you, the audience who have joined us. \u2026 And I am extraordinarily, deeply grateful to the 200 people who work here,\u201d Colbert continued.\n\u201cWe get to do this show for each other, every day, all day,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is a fantastic job. I wish someone else was getting it.\u201d\nCBS\u2019 decision marks the end of the network\u2019s historic late-night programming, which started when David Letterman jumped ship from NBC in 1993 to host \u201cThe Late Show With David Letterman.\u201d\nColbert took over the show when Letterman left in 2015. He\u2019s been a consistent ratings leader for the network ever since.\nThe star has hosted nearly 1,700 episodes over the span of almost 10 seasons. His first show aired on Sept. 8, 2015.\nBefore his stint on \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d Colbert starred on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and \u201cThe Colbert Report.\u201d\nThere were already rumblings that Colbert might be on the chopping block, as Skydance Media is slated to acquire Paramount Global, CBS\u2019 parent company.\nThis is just another blow to CBS, which recently settled a lawsuit with President Trump in order to keep the peace and save the Skydance-Paramount merger.\nThe network already canceled \u201cAfter Midnight\u201d with comedian Taylor Tomlinson, which replaced \u201cThe Late Late Show with James Corden,\u201d after just two seasons.\nAs for its competing networks, ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d is set to film its final season of a three-year deal in fall, and NBC\u2019s Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers signed deals last year to continue their shows through 2028."

PBS \u2014 which features programming like \u201cSesame Street\u201d \u2014 reportedly receives 16% of its funding from the federal government.\nTrump, who blasted NPR and PBS funding as a waste of federal dollars, cheered the cuts last month following the congressional vote.\n\u201cHouse approves nine billion dollar cuts package, including atrocious NPR and public broadcasting, where billions of dollars a year were wasted,\u201d Trump wrote in all capital letters in a July post on Truth Social.\n\u201cRepublicans have tried doing this for 40 years, and failed\u2026.but no more. This is big!!!\u201d\nThe Trump administration has also filed a lawsuit against three CPB board members who have refused to abandon their posts despite Trump\u2019s orders for them to be fired.\nWith Post wires"

      "text": "Seth Meyers says future of \u2018Late Night\u2019 is \u2018outside of my control,\u2019 details mental health concerns if show gets axed\nSeth Meyers is anxious about the future of \u201cLate Night.\u201d\nThe talk show host, 51, said his mental health will plummet if his NBC show will get the boot \u2014 much like the recent cancellation of Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show.\u201d\nSpeaking on the \u201cArmchair Expert\u201d podcast, the \u201cSNL\u201d alum told host Dax Shepard that he\u2019s concerned about the fate of his own show.\n\u201cOnly because it is such a time we\u2019re living in as far as the entertainment industry,\u201d he said in the episode, which was recorded before Colbert\u2019s format was axed by CBS.\n\u201cThere is this weird thing [where] I feel like I shifted from fearing that I wouldn\u2019t be good enough and now my fear is weirdly more outside my control, which is just at some point the ecosystem might not support it. I guess that\u2019s better than thinking it\u2019s your fault, but it is weird to not feel any control over it.\u201d\n\u201cLate Night with Seth Meyers\u201d premiered in February 2014 \u2014 and the host has fronted almost 1,700 episodes to-date.\n\u201cI would worry about myself, like, mental health-wise,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I put a lot of thought into diversifying my skill set.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, financially, I could have been fine just doing the show for the last eleven years. But then it was like, oh, you know what? I feel like there\u2019s something to trying to build a stand-up career and trying to do other things,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more like, try to find something that makes you as happy as late night\u2019s making you, but it\u2019s not just to have busy work or anything,\u201d Meyers went on. \u201cIt\u2019s like, oh, I like these things, too. And there\u2019s no one entity that can take everything away at once, and I think that\u2019s the scariest situation to be in.\u201d\nMeyers\u2019 show, which is produced by Broadway Video and Universal Television for NBC, taught him to \u201cjust show up and do the work.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only part they\u2019re paying you to do, it\u2019s the only part you\u2019re good at. All the other problems, we have people that are as good as that as you are at a thing you do and don\u2019t mess around with it,\u201d he went on.\n\u201cI sometimes take stock of, this isn\u2019t the best time to be doing what I\u2019m doing but at least I got in. The world knows Seth Meyers in a way that I\u2019m happy with.\u201d\nMeyers admitted that his show experienced some teething issues in its early days, with NBC honchos addressing their concerns upfront.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had lower points in the body of the show where, early on in the show, we had some NBC executives actually say to us \u2018We\u2019re very worried about how the show is going to go,\u2019\u201d he revealed.\nThe cancellation of Colbert\u2019s CBS show has prompted a slew of comedy\u2019s biggest stars \u2014 including Jimmy Fallon, John Oliver, Jon Stewart, Adam Sandler and more \u2014 to speak out in support of the host.\nColbert addressed the network\u2019s decision during the July 27 taping at the Ed Sullivan Theater in NYC.\n\u201cBefore we start the show, I want to let you know something that I found out just last night: Next year will be our last season,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cThe network will be ending \u2018The Late Show\u2019 in May.\u201d\nThe news was met with loud boos from the audience.\n\u201cYeah, I share your feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the end of our show, but it\u2019s the end of \u2018The Late Show\u2019 on CBS. I\u2019m not being replaced. This is all just going away.\u201d\n\u201cWe get to do this show for each other, every day, all day, and I\u2019ve had the pleasure and the responsibility of sharing what we do every day with you in front of this camera for the last 10 years,\u201d he went on.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s a job that I\u2019m looking forward to doing with this usual gang of idiots for another 10 months. It\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d\nThe network has publicly cited financial reasons behind the decision to cancel the show."

      "text": "Of all people, The Late Show host Stephen Colbert knows that working in TV can be murder. Now, Vulture has learned he\u2019s going to put that real-life experience to work as a guest star on CBS\u2019s homicide-of-the-week drama Elsbeth. Colbert, whose top-rated 11:35 p.m. program recently got handed a very unexpected cancellation notice, will appear on Robert and Michelle King\u2019s The Good Fight spinoff as the host of \u2026 a late-night talk show called Way Late with Scotty Bristol. Production on the episode has been taking place this week in New York, indicating this episode was almost surely planned before CBS announced on July 17 it was ending The Late Show next spring. (Perhaps the Kings, Elsbeth showrunner Jonathan Tolins, and their team have inherited the psychic gifts of their peers on The Simpsons?)\nIt\u2019s not clear when Colbert himself agreed to book the episode, but while interviewing Elsbeth co-star Wendell Pierce on The Late Show in February, the host said he had been telling his CBS bosses that he very much wanted to make an appearance on Elsbeth, with Pierce joking he could \u201cmake that happen.\u201d Sources say conversations about a Colbert appearance have indeed been in the works for a while. Elsbeth is certainly no stranger to booking big-name guest stars, particularly famous New Yorkers: Nathan Lane appeared in the season-two premiere, while Matthew Broderick, Jane Krakowski, Retta, and Laurie Metcalf all made appearances.\nThe exact timeline of the ironic twist of fate that gave us this casting is still unclear, but we will likely see Colbert on Elsbeth relatively soon. Networks always reserve the right to tinker with airdates of episodes, but Colbert\u2019s episode will probably serve as the third season opener of the Carrie Preston\u2013led series, which is currently set to premiere on a special night \u2014 Sunday, October 12 \u2014 to take advantage of an NFL lead-in. No word on whether Colbert will play a victim, a murderer, or something else, and CBS declined to comment on any aspect of this story, but during his chat with Pierce, Colbert said he really wanted to play a corpse. Scotty Bristol should probably watch his back.\nMore on \u2018The Late Show\u2019 Cancellation\n- David Letterman Calls Colbert\u2019s Cancelation\"Gutless\u2019\n- Don\u2019t Crown Colbert an Emmy Winner Just Yet\n- Stephen Colbert Begins the Slow Process of Going Out with a Bang"
