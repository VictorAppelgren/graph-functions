  "title": "The Best Website Builders for 2025",
  "description": "Want to build a website without much cost or effort? The top website builders we've tested include tools for quickly creating attractive, well-designed pages for blogs, online businesses, and everything in between.",
  "content": "The best website builders let you design pages with more design flexibility than anything you'll find on social media, though with fewer tools than traditional web hosting services. We've been testing website builders for a decade, regularly updating our reviews as companies add and remove features. There are many services to explore, so leverage our expert advice to find the right one for the task. Wix is a great place to start\u2014it's our top pick overall thanks to its price, e-commerce options, and intuitive editing interface. It isn't the only service we highly recommend, so read on for the rest of our favorites, followed by everything you should know before signing up for a website builder.\n\nBuying Guide: The Best Website Builders for 2025\n\nA website builder is simply any service that lets you create your own website. Why do you need a website in the social media age? On a personal level, you wouldn't want to send prospective employers to your Facebook page, so a website makes more sense as an online, customized resume. On a business level, you can quickly spin up a site to focus on sales. Another reason worth considering, for personal and business purposes, is that building your own site gives you endless design choices. You have total control over the products and services you sell (and how they're delivered, too).\n\nFurther, having a real, dedicated site makes a business seem more authoritative and trustworthy than a Facebook or Tumblr presence can on its own (though you should certainly also consider those services as elements of your online presence). It's as much an opening ante in the business world as having a business card for your company.\n\nBuilding your own website used to require a lot of tech wizardry, including knowledge of servers, HTML, FTP, site registrars, and web hosting services. Thankfully, website builders make the process super simple. The services included here let you make a well-designed, mobile-friendly site with minimal technical knowledge. They can take a small or sole proprietor business to profitability via buy links, online stores, and other money-making options.\n\nLarger businesses spend thousands of dollars on custom-designed and programmed sites. While still a strong choice for basic users, Duda is pivoting toward teams and agencies needing custom, expensive enterprise software as a service. However, there's no need for smaller organizations and individuals to go to that kind of expense. For about $10 per month (or around $25 if you're selling products) and a few hours of your time, the DIY services included here can help you create a unique, eye-catching website.\n\nWith all these services, you build everything yourself, starting with a template you choose from a (hopefully) wide, well-categorized selection. Most use simple drag-and-drop interfaces that let you include social share buttons, photo galleries, blogs, media players, and other items. Some website builders let you restrict viewing by implementing a password and offering site memberships.\n\nWhat Are the Best Free Website Builders?\n\nSeveral of the website builders included here offer free options, too. If you choose that path, your site will include branding from the provider, which makes your site less impressive to savvy surfers and shoppers. Free offerings vary greatly in the storage, bandwidth, and site options they allow, so read the small print to find out how much you get with each web host. Strikingly, Weebly, and Wix are among the most generous with their free offerings. For more, check out the best free website builders.\n\nHow to Register Your Domain\n\nBefore you start building your home on the web, you need an address. Most site builders let you register a unique domain, or give you a web address using the provider's URL (yourname.sitebuilder.com, for example). Some include a custom domain name with their plans, usually requiring a year's commitment. The services also let you use a URL you've acquired from a third-party registrar, such as pairNIC, but you often must pay the site builder for that privilege.\n\nAll the web services listed here require you to start by choosing from a selection of templates for your site. The better ones use templates that automatically reformat your site for viewing on mobile devices. Squarespace, in particular, has many useful and attractive templates. These services also offer specifically targeted templates based on your site's purpose, such as for promoting a bakery's sales, getting gigs for a musician, or keeping wedding guests informed.\n\nMost site builders let you tweak the color scheme, fonts, and page layouts, and add new pages. A good site builder offers sub-templates for the most commonly used page types, such as About, Blog, Contact, FAQ, Galleries, and Products.\n\nOf course, you'll also want to add custom content to those pages, such as text areas, photos (see Photos and Galleries section below), buttons, and other widgets. The better site builders offer a marketplace of third-party widgets for things like forms, chat, reservations, and social feeds.\n\nSome site builders restrict you to placing page objects in spots that won't make your site look garish, which can be an advantage if design isn't your forte. Other builders offer more freedom; if that's what you want, check out Wix. Squarespace enables pockets of freedom in an otherwise ordered grid.\n\nMany website builders offer AI-powered tools. They let you enter social accounts and other personal or business info and automatically deliver a no-work website. Wix's ADI (artificial design intelligence) tool even impressed a professional designer acquaintance with its results. These tools are only growing more capable as they implement generative text functionality similar to ChatGPT.\n\nSite builders, including GoDaddy, Hostinger, Squarespace, and Wix, have AI tools that let you enter a prompt to create themed designs, blocks of descriptive text, effective marketing strategies, or even the entire site. That said, you can (and should) tweak the elements from there, nothing replaces that human touch. AI can potentially save you time and money, but it comes at the cost of quality.\n\nResponsive design is a popular web design strategy used by some website builders. This approach reformats the web page content to fit different screens. In terms of search engine optimization (SEO), the search engines only care about whether a site suitably displays on mobile screens. Bing and Google have pages where you can enter your URL to see if your site functions well on mobile.\n\nSimvoly, uKit, and Weeby's strict response approach means you cannot control the mobile view. Ucraft and Wix, by contrast, offer a mobile site preview and let you make customizations that only apply to mobile viewing. For example, you may want a splash page to welcome mobile viewers or leave out an element that doesn't work well on smaller screens.\n\nThe Best Website Builders for Photography\n\nThe highlighted website builders offer some degree of photo and gallery display. Some, like Squarespace and Wix, include stock photography. Others let you touch up images with editing tools such as cropping, brightness, and Instagram-like filters.\n\nPhoto gallery options widely vary. For example, Weebly offers a good selection of styles for your online galleries, while GoDaddy has more limited visual options.\n\nThe Best E-Commerce Website Builder for Businesses\n\nOf course, if you want to go all out for sales, you need to move up to a dedicated web shopping cart service, but that's a step you might not be ready to take. Many services highlighted here offer the ability to sell items from your site, if only in the form of a PayPal button (for some platforms, the option is limited to premium accounts). Comparing, say, Shopify vs. Squarespace highlights this dichotomy.\n\nSome builders' more advanced options let you process credit card payments and add your cart and checkout pages. They also include product promotions, email marketing, and inventory and shipping tools. Some let you sell digital downloads, while others don't; see the table to find out which do. Only a few website builders let you put ads on your site, though most allow some custom HTML code insertion.\n\nWhich Website Builder Has the Best Social and Site Stats?\n\nThe site builders included here let you put Facebook Like and Twitter/X Follow buttons on your pages, and some even let you display feeds from social networks. Many products offer SEO tools, but too often, this is just a form for entering meta tags. You're mostly left to wrestle with that black magic known as SEO for yourself. It's important to submit and verify your site to the search engines unless you don't want anyone to find it!\n\nMost of the products here can tell you about your site traffic, though the amount of detail varies greatly among them, and it's often tied to premium account levels. For example, Weebly displays page views and unique visitors for each day of the month, as well as search terms used to get to the site, referring sites, and top-visited pages. Wix and uKit, on the other hand, have little or even nothing in the way of built-in site stats, instead encouraging you to create your own Google Analytics account (which requires a paid website builder account). Another drawback of that approach is that you can only see traffic from the preceding day and earlier; it's not up-to-the-minute or even the hour.\n\nWordPress is a big name when it comes to creating websites. But you should know that WordPress.com is not what most people are talking about when they mention WordPress. What most internet-savvy people mean by the term WordPress is the free, open-source blogging platform that comes from WordPress.org. Using this requires you to find your website hosting service. WordPress.org software is such a popular site-building platform that many web hosting services even offer managed WordPress hosting plans. WordPress.com, however, is a service that deploys and hosts that software for you, so you don't have to find a hosting service.\n\nWordPress (either version) is a blog-focused content management system that accepts plug-ins and themes that extend its capabilities. In fact, WordPress.com uses plug-ins such as JetPack to provide many of its features. As a whole, WordPress (either .com or .org) is not as easy to use as the other options in this roundup. If blogging and site transferability are important, and you don't mind digging into its weeds, you should consider the platform\u2014especially WordPress.org. Furthermore, WordPress familiarity is valuable, as some estimates say that WordPress powers 40% of the internet.\n\nNote that we reviewed WordPress.com as a website builder, but its three-star rating doesn't quite qualify it for inclusion in this roundup. Instead, consider a WordPress-centric site builder like Bluehost WonderSuite.\n\nHow to Move to Another Website Builder\n\nThese services have a major downside. Due to the website builders ' custom code, you'll likely be out of luck if you want to move to another web host. Only a few services let you take your site to another web hosting service. The most complete example is Weebly, which lets you download the standard site server folders. Squarespace offers some transferability by letting you output your site in standard WordPress format. As you might expect, the same transferability holds for WordPress.com.\n\nWebsite builders offer varying customer support options. For instance, Wix has a telephone callback service\u2014even for free accounts! Many site builders have rich online support knowledge bases and FAQs, so there's a good chance you won't need to contact the company. We test each service's support as part of the review process by asking about some less common site-building procedures.\n\nThe Best Website Builders for Small Businesses\n\nThe best website builders help individuals and businesses create and maintain a web presence. Small business owners already have plenty to deal with, so trusting these builders to make a great website is a huge relief. You should look for robust e-commerce options, like Wix's, to sell products. Generative AI tools like Hostinger's may help save valuable time for other important tasks. And the marketing and SEO tools in GoDaddy Website Builder can help spread the word about your brand.",

These services offer more design flexibility than those found on social media, but with fewer tools than traditional web hosting services. Wix, our top pick overall due to its price, e-commerce options, and intuitive editing interface, is considered a top-rated service. The services included in this article also offer buy links, online stores, and other revenue-making options. For about $10 per month, these DIY services can create a unique, eye-catching website with a few hours of time. However, larger businesses often spend thousands on custom-designed and programmed sites, while Duda is focusing on teams and agencies needing custom, expensive enterprise software as a service.",

      "text": "WordPress Market Share Statistics (2011-2025)\nWhen you\u2019re looking to create a website, you\u2019re likely to encounter lots of talk about several content management systems, including WordPress. This may leave you wondering\u2014just how much of the market share does WordPress dominate? And how does it compare to its various competitors?\nSpoiler alert \u2013 the answers are that:\n- WordPress is the world\u2019s most popular content management system, so it\u2019s about as popular as can be.\n- WordPress dominates other markets, like ecommerce, so it\u2019s definitely not just for blogging.\nAnd to show you where those conclusions came from, we\u2019ve collected some mind-boggling statistics about WordPress\u2019 market share, as well as the market share of two of the most popular ecommerce plugins for WordPress \u2013 WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads.\nWordPress\u2019 market share is 43.6% of all websites\nWordPress powers 43.6% of all the websites on the Internet, including those without a content management system (CMS) or with a custom-coded CMS. Or, to put it another way, WordPress powers over one-third of the web! And if you limit the data set to only websites with a known CMS, WordPress\u2019 market share becomes even more dominant.\nIn that case, WordPress holds a 62.1% market share for content management systems on websites with a known CMS. How does that compare to the market share of other popular content management systems? Let\u2019s take a peek:\n| % All Websites | % CMS Market | |\n|---|---|---|\n| WordPress | 43.6 | 62.1 |\n| Shopify | 4.6 | 6.6 |\n| Wix | 3.2 | 4.6 |\n| Squarespace | 2.2 | 3.2 |\n| Joomla | 1.6 | 2.3 |\n| Drupal | 0.9 | 1.3 |\nWhile much has been made of hosted website builder tools like Squarespace and Wix, the numbers show that WordPress isn\u2019t in any danger of being dethroned any time soon! WordPress also holds a dominant position over Joomla, another popular self-hosted content management system, and Shopify, a widely used hosted ecommerce platform.\nIs WordPress\u2019 market share still growing?\nYes! WordPress\u2019s market share has been growing pretty consistently since 2011. 2023 marked the first year since 2011 that WordPress market share dropped, but even then, it was only a slight drop of 0.1%,\nAt the start of 2017, WordPress powered 27.3% of all websites. By August 2024, WordPress had reached a market share of 43.5%.\nHow does that square up with years past? Here\u2019s WordPress\u2019 overall market share going all the way back to 2011:\n| 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 13.1% | 15.8% | 17.4% | 21.0% | 23.3% | 25.6% | 27.3% | 29.2% | 32.7% | 35.4% | 39.5% | 43.2% | 43.1% | 43.6% |\nAs you can see, WordPress has been consistently growing its market share (in overall market share numbers) over the past few years. And it shows no signs of slowing down. If this trend continues, it won\u2019t be long until WordPress is powering one-half of all the websites on the Internet.\nOver 900 companies contributed to WordPress core in 2023.\nHow does WordPress\u2019 growth compare with other content management systems?\nSo WordPress is growing\u2026 but is it growing faster than the competition? That\u2019s a trickier question to answer.\nFrom 2023 to 2024:\n- Shopify\u2019s market share increased from 5.7% to 6.6%\n- Wix\u2019s market share increased from 3.6% to 4.6%\n- Squarespace\u2019s market share increased from 3.0% to 3.2%\n- Joomla\u2019s market share decreased from 2.7% to 2.3%\n- Drupal\u2019s market share decreased from 1.8% to 1.3%\nThese minor changes in market share reflect the growth of specialized platforms like Shopify and Wix, which cater to niche needs. However, for those looking for a versatile, powerful, and highly customizable platform, WordPress remains the top choice.\nIn 2024, WordPress continues to be the most popular content management system, powering over 43.5% of all websites. While the market saw a slight shift from 2023 to 2024, with WordPress\u2019s share adjusting slightly, it\u2019s essential to recognize that this is still a dominant position far ahead of competitors.\nYou can see these growth trends play themselves out in Google Trends, where Wix, Squarespace, and Joomla (and, to a lesser extent, WordPress) have declined or remained flat, while Shopify is generating increasing interest:\nWooCommerce Market Share\nBecause WordPress originated in blogging, you might be surprised to realize how dominant WordPress is in other areas \u2013 notably, ecommerce.\nWooCommerce, the most popular ecommerce plugin for WordPress, powers 17% of all the ecommerce sites on the Internet according to BuiltWith. While that number might not be very impressive, WooCommerce\u2019s market share is actually greater if you filter out lower-traffic sites.\nOf the Top 1 Million Sites on the Internet, WooCommerce is still a very popular solution.\nHow does WooCommerce\u2019s market share compare to Shopify?\nWhile WooCommerce is a market leader, Shopify is competitive and even leading in some categories. Here\u2019s how WooCommerce\u2019s market share compares to Shopify when you segment by website popularity:\n| WooCommerce | Shopify | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Entire Internet | 17% | 28% |\n| Top Million Sites | 14% | 24% |\n| Top 100k Sites | 8% | 20% |\n| Top 10k Sites | 5% | 19% |\nWhen you look at only the Top 100k or Top 10k most popular websites on the Internet, Shopify is the market leader. But, it\u2019s worth pointing out that only 36,094 websites in that Top 100k slice are running a known ecommerce platform, so the sample size is not very large. And in terms of the actual number of sites in the Top 10k Sites running each platform:\n- 342 sites are using Shopify\n- 97 sites are using WooCommerce\nEasy Digital Downloads market share\nWhile it\u2019s not nearly as popular as WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads is still a small but noticeable player in the ecommerce industry.\nAccording to BuiltWith, Easy Digital Downloads powers 0.07% of the BuiltWith Top Million (an estimate of the one million most popular websites on the Internet).\nHere\u2019s to the world\u2019s most popular CMS\nWhile the growth of hosted website builders like Squarespace, Wix, and Shopify is something to pay attention to, all the numbers add up to one conclusion: WordPress is, without a doubt, the world\u2019s most popular way to build a website.\nAre you ready to get started? We offer one-click WordPress installations so you can get up and running in no time."
