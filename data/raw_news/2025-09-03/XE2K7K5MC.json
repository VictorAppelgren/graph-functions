  "content": "We've gotten our first look at 007: First Light gameplay, and Hitman fans will see plenty of familiar mechanics from developer IO Interactive's World of Assassination. But don't let the goofy guard distraction mechanics distract you \u2013 the devs are keen to (once again) make sure you know this isn't just a Hitman game in an Agent 47-style disguise.\n\n\"We have a very talented team back home, and our team has expanded ever since we first announced the game,\" senior licensing producer Theuns Smit tells GamesRadar+. \"Obviously, that meant there was even more interest. We were able to bring in amazing fresh talent to bolster what we already have at the studio, and that has been a really big growth moment for us as a studio.\"\n\nThese additional devs have given IO \"fresh eyes, fresh expertise, all of that,\" Smit continues, \"while still leaning [into] our strengths, [with] the pedigree of 25 years behind us. It comes about the game first. The experience first. If you're looking at Hitman, it's the way it is for a particular reason, because that's the gameplay experience we want to give. For Bond, it's not exactly that. It's not a reskin of that.\"\n\nOne big difference between Hitman and First Light is the presence of drivable cars, which we see multiple times in today's new gameplay footage. That's an area where IO has very little experience, and it seems the influx of new devs was particularly important here.\n\n\"It was absolutely a huge challenge, and also a challenge we didn't take on lightly,\" franchise art director Rasmus Poulsen tells us. \"We had to bring onto the team specific driving expertise, i.e. people that had experience coding, setting up, tweaking, balancing.\n\n\"Because of course it's a balancing act of making a vehicle feel both exciting, credible, and dangerous at the same time as being approachable and fun for a wide audience. So absolutely, that balance is very difficult and indeed a new adventure for us, so something we took very seriously. And I'm pleased to say, I feel [we] have landed in an amazing space.\"\n\n007 First Light is more than just Hitman: James Bond edition, and I'm over any fears I might have had that IO couldn't deliver.",

      "text": "007: First Light isn't an Uncharted-style action game, but it's not just another Hitman game either: \"We are leaning a lot on what IOI does best\"\n\"We don't want the game to just go by shooting and shooting and shooting\"\nAt first blush, 007: First Light looks like quite the departure for Hitman developer IO Interactive, but apparently it's also not the straightforward, Uncharted-style action game that it appears to be. Fear not, there's still plenty of Hitman DNA in there.\nWe caught up with IO's 007 franchise director Jonathan Lacaille during Summer Game Fest 2025, and we basically asked him for a vibe check. Is 007: First Light the linear, cinematic action game it looks like in its announcement trailer from this week, or can we expect to see more of the Hitman series' systems-driven design that IO has become known for these days?\n\"It's neither,\" he said. \"IOI has a pedigree, and that fits really well with the [007] IP, so we are leaning into that, of course. But that would not tell the full story ... we are leaning a lot on what IOI does best.\"\nSo, it definitely sounds like IOI diehards won't be left wanting for the studio's signature style, but Lacaille added that, \"We had to come up with a lot of new things that IOI had to learn and to reiterate on to really bring the Bond experience.\"\nHe mentioned driving as an example of a new gameplay mechanic IOI had to learn, as the Hitman games don't have driving. Shooting guns, likewise, is something you really don't want to do much in Hitman, but naturally in a game like 007: First Light, it's a big part of the experience. Still, Lacaille stressed that \"we don't want the game to just go by shooting and shooting and shooting. We want to give the player a lot of tools to feel as smart as Bond in the game.\"\nAfter a somewhat conspicuously long period of silence, 007: First Light is slated for launch next year on PS5, Xbox Series X, Switch 2, and PC via Steam and the Epic Game Store.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nAfter earning an English degree from ASU, I worked as a corporate copy editor while freelancing for places like SFX Magazine, Screen Rant, Game Revolution, and MMORPG on the side.

      "text": "007 First Light leads say James Bond is no Agent 47: \"If Hitman is a single-minded killer and basically the bad guy of the game, Bond is the hero\"\nIO Interactive promises a fresh take on 007, putting real character into the next James Bond game\nIO Interactive, the studio behind the acclaimed Hitman series, has opened up about the very different approach it's taking with its next big title: 007 First Light. If you\u2019re expecting a straightforward reskin of Agent 47 in a tuxedo, think again.\nSpeaking with PC Gamer, art director Rasmus Poulsen is keen to draw a clear line between the developer's infamous bald assassin and the world\u2019s most famous secret agent. \u201cIf Hitman is a single-minded killer and basically the bad guy of the game,\u201d Poulsen says, \u201cBond is the hero.\u201d It\u2019s a surprisingly candid statement, especially from a studio best known for letting players think like a villain.\nThis shift in perspective is shaping every layer of the new game. \u201cThat means we are much more focused on his journey as a character, and we are much more focused on saving the world,\u201d Poulsen explains. In other words, don\u2019t expect Bond to blend into the background or play puppet to the player\u2019s every whim. 007 First Light aims to provide a more cinematic, character-driven experience. Something that puts Bond\u2019s story and personality front and centre.\nIO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak hammered home that point directly by comparing the two iconic characters. While Agent 47 has always been something of a blank slate, an \u201cempty shell,\u201d as Abrak describes him, James Bond \u201cis very much a personality.\u201d\nWhat does this mean in practice? While IO\u2019s Hitman games thrive on cold efficiency and creative sandbox mayhem, 007 First Light looks set to offer a completely different kind of power fantasy. Bond isn\u2019t just a tool. He\u2019s a hero with opinions, emotions, and a world to save.\nFor fans, this is a promise of a Bond game that goes beyond the gadgets and the glamour. IO Interactive wants to explore what makes James Bond tick, what drives him to risk everything, and what it actually means to be the hero rather than the anti-hero. If they pull it off, 007 First Light could be the fresh take the Bond franchise has been missing for years.\n007: First Light is planned for sometime in 2026, and it\u2019s clear that IO Interactive is set on giving players a fresh spin on the Bond formula. Rather than simply ticking off classic spy tropes, the team wants to dig into what really makes Bond a hero. If they succeed, fans could be in for a much deeper, more personal take on the iconic secret agent.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nNathan Walters originally joined Future in February 2022 as a deals writer and is based in Cardiff, Wales.

      "text": "Hitman dev says 007 First Light isn't \"just shooting and shooting and shooting,\" and spy gadgets will allow for \"varied and spread out\" approaches to missions in the James Bond game\nNew hero, new rules\nIOI, the developer behind the legendary Hitman series, is working on a James Bond game, 007: First Light. But how will the team's stealth pedigree translate to the more action-oriented 007 spy capers?\nSpeaking to GamesRadar+ at Summer Game Fest, 007 franchise director at IOI, Jonathan Lacaille, explains the balance between the more linear, Uncharted-style trailer and IOI's signature systemic gameplay.\n\"It's either or,\" Lacaille replies. \"IOI has a pedigree, and that fits really well on IP, so we are leaning into that, of course. But that would not tell the full story of who Bond is.\"\nLike Agent 47, Bond is a spy, but he's also not afraid of chasing down parkour runners in building sites or engaging in a shooting car chase through an ancient European town.\n\"We are leaning a lot on what IOI does best, but we had to come up with a lot of new things that IOI had to learn and to reiterate on to really bring the full Bond experience,\" Lacaille says. \"For instance, driving, not done that before, and we're doing that now.\"\nMoreso than ever, though, IOI is developing a game with a lot more shooting in it than the Hitman series has. \"Shooting usually was a failing condition in Hitman, and here it's a big part of the game,\" Lacaille explains. \"We don't want the game to just go by shooting and shooting and shooting. So we want to give the player a lot of tools to feel as smart as Bond in the game.\"\nLacaille goes on to say there will be gadgets that we can use to help us out and allow us to take \"kind of varied and spread out\" approaches, which sounds more similar to what IOI has done with Hitman in the past. But, teasingly, he says we'll have to wait to learn more about those systems.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nIn the meantime, check out everything that was announced at Summer Game Fest 2025.\nI'm Issy, a freelancer who you'll now occasionally see over here covering news on GamesRadar.

      "text": "My demo of 007 First Light opens unlike any other James Bond game, book, or film I've ever seen. Rather than some explosive action scene, it's positively sedate, Bond decked out in a chauffeur's uniform as he drives gently up to the exterior of a hotel buried deep in the Slovakian mountains. But from these humble beginnings that bring Bond in-line with First Light's origins in the Hitman series, developer IO Interactive quickly shows that it's not afraid to blend its stealthy pedigree with the explosively high stakes you'd expect from 007.\nThe first half of the demo is slow, methodical - and personally frustrating to Bond. 007: First Light acts as an origin story, and this is our young secret agent's first mission. He's been chosen specifically to work alongside other MI6 operatives who are also brand new to the world of international espionage, but he's drawn the short straw. While his teammates are posing as high-flyers attending an exclusive chess tournament, Bond is their driver, and as such is left to man the exit as a last line of defense in case the target - rogue agent 009 - tries to beat a hasty retreat.\nTrue to 007, however, it's not long before Bond abandons his post to investigate some mysterious behavior. But as a humble chauffeur, getting access to the hotel is no easy feat. It's here that you can feel IO's history with the Hitman series most clearly - this sequence is a case of distracting guards and sneaking around. But this isn't a Hitman game. Bond is a secret agent who can't arouse suspicion, not an assassin who can do whatever he likes as long as he gets his target. Feats of acrobatics or being seen committing distracting shenanigans will blow your cover so quickly that First Light doesn't even let you try to do them while there's a chance you can be seen.\nEventually, Bond's able to distract one guard with a rogue garden hose, steal a lighter to ignite a wheelbarrow of dried leaves, and use the ensuing chaos to shimmy up an unseen drainpipe to an open window. The employees inside are temporarily shocked, but Bond explains away his incursion in a moment of 007-esque improvisation, telling them he's a security expert assessing the hotel's perimeter. I was initially concerned that this was too linear a sequence, something more akin to a puzzle game than an action title, but IO representatives explained that it was just one of many ways to get to your target.\n\"Secret\" agent\nIf you can't wait to get blasting as Bond, we've rounded up the best FPS games you can play now\nFrom here, we quickly get to see Bond at his most suave, mingling with the hotel's wealthy clientele (while dodging the friendly MI6 agents inside who may recognize him away from his post). His Q watch can be used to assess the environment, and in our demo James opts to search for his target - in this case a suspicious bellboy - by asking a nearby bartender. It's a confident, well-written interpretation of Bond, with a self-assuredness that doesn't tip over into arrogance, and which understands his position as a junior agent still finding his feet, but who's still prepared to disregard orders.\nUnfortunately, we don't get to see the direct consequences of that particular decision, as the demo skips ahead to a point where things have definitely gone south. 009 is making a run for it, and a dramatically more disheveled Bond is tasked with keeping chase - in a classic Aston Martin, of course, and with a beautiful woman handing him the keys.\nIt's at this point that we're in unknown territory. While the Hitman series made IO the clear favorites to cover the sneakier aspects of Bond, those games often take place in dense but incredibly well-contained stealth sandboxes. The huge hotel you're tasked with infiltrating fits that pedigree perfectly. But now we're careening down country roads at high speeds. Driving and large-scale open areas are both whole new ball games for this studio, but they're also an integral part of any James Bond game.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nWhile it's impossible to get a real feel for the wheel during a hands-off session, what I see is pretty good. There's as true a sensation of rubber over tarmac as you can hope for. It's fast, frantic, and filled with set pieces as Bond and his mysterious new ally fly after the escaping 009. Narrow streets give way to sprawling fields, the tracks carved by both Bond and his quarry being left in the fields as they drive. One particularly gnarly collision deforms the rear windscreen and bumper, smashing through a fence briefly attaches a trail of barbed wire to the car. Tires squeal and smoke kicks up as the Aston is flung around a tight mountain road.\nTakeoff\nAnd then suddenly it's over, and 009 is making his way to an airfield. Bond gives chase on foot, his femme fatale friend hoping to cut their joint target off in the car. It's here that IO takes another pivot from its traditional fare, switching into the conventional third-person action fare that's another obvious part of any 007 game. A dark figure spots James' attempted infiltration, and learns too late that while this Bond doesn't yet have his license to kill, any obvious danger is one that can swiftly be put down.\nThat first pistol shot ignites an enormous shootout, one so explosive that it would be more at home at a Bond film's climax than its opening. As James shoots his way across the airfield in an attempt to prevent 009's plane from taking off, all hell quickly breaks loose. Again, it's hard to get a sense of the gunplay without having a controller in-hand, but it feels slightly less clean than the driving did. Where Bond films go for massive shootouts, they're often finely choreographed and edited to make each shot or explosion hit as hard as it can. In third-person, much of the action gets lost in the midground. Overall, the sequence is more like the blunt trauma of Just Cause or The Expendables than the tighter scenes that define more modern action movies.\nThere are certainly exceptions though. One highlight comes when James' clip runs out, and rather than diving for cover or reloading on the fly, he simply flings the empty rifle at a nearby enemy, staggering them long enough to take them out in close combat. Later, he kicks a fresh gun up to his hands with a practised flick, barely breaking stride as he continues his rampage. From there, the sense of cinema builds, and in an attempt to chase down the rapidly accelerating cargo plane, James jumps behind the wheel of some mobile stairs, using his unlikely new vehicle to climb aboard.\nOn the face of things, it's clearly ridiculous, and at one point I did wince at the strength of James' apparent plot armor. But even if the direction doesn't always keep up, the tone of the whole thing is unapologetically Bond. On occasion the demo begins to stray into the almost arcade-y territory of Uncharted's biggest set pieces, but IO never really loses sight of how to make this feel authentic to its source material. My biggest internal test is whether I can see Daniel Craig pulling off a given stunt, and it's very rare that it feels my answer would be 'no'.\nGoing into Gamescom, 007: First Light was my most-anticipated title, but that feeling came with a lot of trepidation. I'm a long-term Hitman fan, and had no worries about IO's ability to pull off that aspect of Bond. But I know that charisma, gadgetry, and social stealth are only one part of the 007 mythos, and that many of the other features that make a good Bond game can be difficult to pull off. From what I've seen so far, IO doesn't completely nail that down every single time, but where it does stumble it's an issue with the format rather than an issue with the delivery itself. If that minor quibble is the only one the studio faces, then my faith in 007: First Light seems well-placed - this could prove to be the perfect Bond game.\nI'm GamesRadar's Managing Editor for news, shaping the news strategy across the team.
