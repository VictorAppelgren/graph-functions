  "title": "Threads crosses 400M monthly active users as it gains on X",
  "description": "Following a series of welcome improvements, Meta CEO announced today Threads crossed the 400 million monthly active users mark.",
  "content": "Following a recent series of welcome updates as Threads turned two, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced today that his X competitor crossed 400 million monthly active users (MAUs), a 50 million boost since April.\n\nThe last time Meta detailed its monthly active user number was on April 30, during its Q1 2025 earnings call, up from 320 million in Q4 2024 in late January.\n\nIf it keeps it stride, this means Meta could see north of 100M MAUs added to Threads in 2025 alone, putting it well past the halfway mark toward catching up with X in terms of monthly active users.\n\nSince going private, X has stopped reporting concrete user data, and the figures it does share can\u2019t be independently verified or audited. Still, former CEO Linda Yaccarino claimed last April that the platform had \u2018nearly 600 million\u2019 MAUs, up slightly from 586 million in January.\n\nThreads has been on a good run lately. It added its own Instagram-unbound direct messaging system, support for spoiler taghing, a dedicated fediverse feed, a highlighting tool, and more.\n\nOn their own, these changes might seem innocuous. But taken together, they suggest that Meta is finally adjusting its roadmap for the app not just based on its rigid vision of what Threads should be or how it should be used, but by listening to its users while at the same time making it more appealing to those open to switching from X.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Threads also announced a leadership shift, with executive Connor Hayes set to take over Adam Mosseri\u2019s day-to-day responsibilities for the app starting next month, while still reporting to him. So it will be interesting to see how, if at all, that might affect the app\u2019s direction or growth rate.\n\nDo you use Threads? Do you always ask if anybody uses Threads? Let us know in the comments.",

      "text": "Instagram Threads, Meta\u2019s X competitor, has now grown to over 350 million monthly active users, CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed during the company\u2019s Q1 2025 earnings call on Wednesday. That\u2019s an increase of 30 million users since the prior quarter, where Meta reported that Threads had 320 million users.\nThe new figure represents increased growth, as Threads added 30 million in the first quarter of this year, compared with 20 million in Q4 2024. It\u2019s also worth noting that in a single quarter, Threads added nearly the same number of users to its network as one of its newer competitors, Bluesky. The latter, a decentralized social app, today has roughly 35 million users.\nX, meanwhile, now has north of 600 million monthly active users, according to statements made by its CEO, Linda Yaccarino, on Wednesday.\nWhile Threads is still small in comparison to Meta\u2019s other social apps \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp \u2014 its growth is helping to cement its place in the microblogging app ecosystem. In total, Meta says that more than 3.4 billion people now use at least one of Meta\u2019s apps daily.\nOn Wednesday\u2019s call, Zuckerberg told investors that the growth indicates that Threads \u201ccontinues to be on track to become our next major social app.\u201d He additionally noted that there\u2019s been a 35% increase in time spent on Threads as a result of improvements to the app\u2019s recommendations systems."

      "text": "Hear from execs at The New York Times, Thomson Reuters, Trusted Media Brands and many others\nWith 600 million monthly active users, X\u2019s Linda Yaccarino doubles down on dismissing journalism\nDigiday is at Possible giving you the latest industry news out of the event in Miami. More from the series \u2192\nLinda Yaccarino continues to cast X as the anti-media media company \u2014 a disruptive alternative to what she and Elon Musk believe is the dusty, broken fourth estate.\nIt\u2019s a contentious claim, especially in an era when President Donald Trump is once again at war with the press. But sitting for a fireside chat with Anthony Pompliano, creator of From the Desk of Anthony Pompliano, on X at Possible this afternoon in Miami, Yaccarino insisted the platform\u2019s (self-reported) numbers back her up.\nAccording to the platform\u2019s CEO, X has nearly amassed 600 million monthly active users (MAUs) globally \u2014 a small increase on the 586 million MAUs that were reported in X\u2019s own tools in January, but not a huge increase on the 570 million MAUs X claimed it had reached back in September 2024.\nStill, nearly a third (31%) of that user growth is coming from Gen Z \u2014 drawn in, apparently, by a taste for authenticity and disposable income. Yaccarino pointed to their projected $36 trillion in spending power by 2024 as proof.\n\u201cX has emerged as the world\u2019s most powerful culture signal, it really has become the global town square,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere ideas collide, debate happens, truth rises and truly every voice is welcome.\u201d\nSuggesting that X has \u201cbypassed or leap frogged legacy media,\u201d Yaccarino claimed that 65% of its users identify the platform as their No. 1 news app.\n\u201cThe new population, new generation, fueled by technology which has freed information, all of data and content consumption has changed forever,\u201d she said.\nIn many ways, these comments reflect the twisted reinvention of Twitter\u2019s premise. Before Musk bought it in October 2023, the social network prided itself on being a hub for credible news and trusted sources. Now, the divisive billionaire wants X to be the source \u2014 arguing again and again that unfiltered speech should replace what he dismisses as \u201clegacy media.\u201d\nNowhere is that shift clearer than in how X handles misinformation, hate speech and other content most users would rather avoid. The company scrapped many of its automated moderation systems in favor of \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d \u2014 crowdsourced fact checks and context from the user base \u2014 which now, according to Yaccarino, has 1 million \u201ccommunity noters\u201d globally. In her view, the feature is \u201cgood for the world\u201d because it\u2019s \u201cretraining us to respect the truth,\u201d she noted.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really, really hard for legacy media to fact check and fight misinformation in real time, at the scale, the way X can, and now Community Notes, being the ecosystem leader,\u201d she said.\nBut the tool was never meant to carry the full weight of content moderation. It was designed to supplement, not replace, more robust systems like internal review teams and AI tools for flagging obvious falsehoods.\nSince X launched this feature globally in December 2022, others have followed suit, from Meta to TikTok, effectively deciding that people don\u2019t need journalism when they have each other.\n\u201cWe\u2019re super excited that first Google, then Meta, more recently TikTok is partnering and following our lead in a dramatic ecosystem change of fact checking and aggressively fighting misinformation,\u201d Yaccarino added.\nIf X\u2019s higher ups want to position the platform as the antidote to news then AI is the engine driving the drive. That\u2019s how Yaccarion spun Musk\u2019s decision to sell X to his AI startup xAI. While its widely seen as a financial play \u2014 fold X into the AI boom and benefit from the revenue bump But its just as likely a data play: merging the two companies would give xAI access to the digital exhaust of X\u2019s users to help train its models.\n\u201cWhen you bring those two things together, you have this profound differentiator because the other AI offerings are static, and they are not powered by the real time data of X combined with the super, super capabilities of X,\u201d said Yaccarino.\nFor better or worse, X is unique\nLike many of the other platform CEOs, Yaccarino certainly wasn\u2019t afraid to talk her platform up and discredit the competition during her conversation with Pompliano.\n\u201cIf you compare X to the other platforms, the other platforms are where you go to lean back, dare I say tune out,\u201d she said. \u201cX is number one in attentiveness compared to all the other social platforms. So you\u2019re leaning in, you\u2019re seeking out information.\u201d\nCompared to Yaccarino\u2019s previous stage efforts as CEO of arguably one of the most talked about and controversial platforms, this time around at Possible, she had confidence in abundance.\nBut what was very absent from the chat, given Possible is an advertiser event, was any real clue about how X is managing to sway those advertisers to spend on the platform. And it seems like that thought wasn\u2019t lost on the audience either.\nIn the queue to get into Inspiration Hall ahead of Yaccarino\u2019s stage moment, Digiday asked execs waiting in line about how they thought the audience would receive her this time around, given the series of mixed headlines about X and its leadership over the past couple of years.\nTwo media agency execs, who asked not to be named, expressed mixed opinions. \u201cI think there is some simmering resentment that might uncork, but we\u2019ll see,\u201d said the first agency exec, who was barely audible as an onstage DJ spun earsplitting Reggaet\u00f3n as the audience trickled into their seats.\n\u201cI think it would be very disrespectful,\u201d if she was heckled in any way, said the second exec. \u201cBut we\u2019d like to hear some assurances that ad sales negotiations with X will take place in the marketplace and not in court,\u201d they added.\nBut Pompliano never touched on lingering brand safety concerns on the platform, or the legal actions it has brought to advertisers that have been reticent to market via X.\n\u2014 Jim Cooper contributed reporting to this story\nMore in Marketing\nCMO Strategies: How marketers are spending and measuring across social media in 2025 \u2014 from Meta to TikTok\nThe fifth installment of Digiday\u2019s CMO Strategies series examines how marketers are spending and measuring across social media platforms in 2025 \u2014 from Meta to TikTok.\nAt Carbone Fine Food, tariffs are putting pressure on its \u2018most important ingredient\u2019\nThe CPG company could face additional long-term costs on its \u2018most important ingredient\u2019: tomatoes from the San Marzano region of Italy.\nX\u2019s automated ad vision left advertisers underwhelmed\nDuring X\u2019s recent Spaces event, Elon Musk unveiled the vision for Grok to automate as much of the ad process as possible."

      "text": "After two years under Instagram head Adam Mosseri, Meta is officially handing off Threads to a new leader. Here\u2019s what the change could mean for the app\u2019s future.\nAs first reported by Axios, Meta is naming longtime executive Connor Hayes, formerly head of generative AI product, as the new head of Threads starting in September.\nThe move marks the first time someone outside Instagram will take the reins of the text-based social app, in yet another sign that Meta seems to be finally getting serious about treating Threads as more than just an Instagram sidekick.\nUntil now, Threads had been overseen by Instagram chief Adam Mosseri, who helped launch the app back in 2023. But in a staff memo sent Thursday, Mosseri said it\u2019s time for dedicated leadership:\n\u201cGiven Threads\u2019 maturity, we think we need a dedicated app lead who can focus all of their time on helping Threads move forward.\u201d\nOne would agree.\nWhat will this mean for the future of Threads?\nHayes has been with Meta since 2011, and he\u2019s held product roles across Instagram and Facebook. He was also part of the original team that build the first version or Threads.\nHis new position begins in mid-September, and once onboarded, he\u2019ll manage all product, design, engineering, and research teams working on Threads.\nHe\u2019ll still report to Mosseri, but the day-to-day responsibilities are shifting.\n9to5Mac\u2019s take\nToday\u2019s move comes at an interesting time for Threads. Just a few days ago, Similarweb reported that despite being behind X in global web traffic, Threads has been bridging the gap on mobile, averaging around 115 million mobile daily active users, compared to X\u2019s 132 million.\nPutting a gen AI exec in charge of Threads could hint at where Meta wants to take the app next, especially as it continues testing AI-generated content in users\u2019 feeds.\nIt is possible that, with Threads still being relatively small compared to other Meta apps, the company might be thinking about using it as a testbed for AI features, before rolling them out more broadly to its other apps.\nDo you use Threads? Do you always ask if anybody still uses Threads?

The app has been enhancing its features, including direct messaging and improved content recommendations, which have contributed to a 35% increase in user engagement. Meanwhile, X claims to have nearly 600 million monthly active users, but its user data remains unverifiable since going private. Additionally, Threads is undergoing a leadership change with Connor Hayes taking over day-to-day operations, indicating Meta's commitment to developing the app further.",
