  "content": "SEATTLE (Reuters) -One year after taking the helm during Boeing\u2019s deepest crisis in decades, CEO Kelly Ortberg has stopped the company's freefall. Now, he faces new challenges: ramping up jet production, reviving a struggling defense and space division, and restoring profitability at the storied planemaker.\n\nOrtberg was comfortably retired in Florida when Boeing\u2019s board offered him the top job at a company bleeding cash and reeling from reputational damage.\n\nThe crisis had deepened after a mid-air panel blowout on a new 737 MAX in January 2024, prompting his predecessor\u2019s exit and reviving memories of two fatal MAX crashes - in 2018 and 2019 - that killed 346 people.\n\nOrtberg arrived promising to restore trust, stay close to the factory floor, and ensure Boeing met its commitments to safety, quality, and transparency.\n\nSince then, Boeing has notched a string of wins: it has improved efficiency and quality on the 737 line, navigated President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies, reached a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice to drop its prosecution over the crashes, signed blockbuster airplane deals, and landed the contract for the U.S.' first sixth-generation fighter, the F-47.\n\nIts stock is up 39% from a year ago, with the biggest gains coming in recent months as 737 output has risen.\n\nBut Boeing is still losing money, trailing Airbus in the single-aisle market, struggling to fix its space and defense programs, carrying heavy debt, acquiring its biggest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, and falling behind on certifying its newest jets.\n\nOrtberg\u2019s immediate challenge is to ramp up production of the 737 MAX to pre-crisis levels and beyond - while positioning Boeing to eventually replace it with a new model.\n\n\"The biggest risk for Boeing looking forward is do they end up becoming a great company again or just a mediocre company?\" said Ron Epstein, Bank of America aerospace analyst.\n\nBoeing declined to make Ortberg available for an interview.\n\nAn Iowa native, Ortberg, 65, spent decades climbing the ranks at avionics firm Rockwell Collins, becoming CEO and steering it through a series of deals resulting in aerospace company RTX.\n\nKnown for his no-nonsense style, he retired in 2021.\n\nJans Timmers, who reported directly to Ortberg at Rockwell Collins, recalled Ortberg saying to him when dealing with a money-losing program: \"Put all the shit on the table and let's deal with it.\"\n\n\"And that's what he's doing at Boeing now,\" he added.\n\nWhen Ortberg arrived, Boeing - once celebrated for helping win World War Two and landing men on the moon - had become synonymous with cutting corners, prioritizing profits over production quality, and misleading regulators and customers.",

  "summary": "Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg has successfully navigated the company into a year of crisis, taking over from its worst crisis in decades. Since his arrival, he has been instrumental in reviving jet production, reviving a struggling defense and space division, and restoring profitability at the storied planemaker. Despite a 39% increase in Boeing's stock, the company is still losing money and trailing Airbus in the single-aisle market, struggling to fix its space and defense programs, and falling behind on certifying its newest jets. Ortberg's immediate challenge is to increase production of the 737 MAX to pre-crisis levels and prepare Boeing for a new model.",
