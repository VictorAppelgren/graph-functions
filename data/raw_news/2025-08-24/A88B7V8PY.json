  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None Netflix\u2019s strong fundamentals have helped the stock soar in the past several years.\n\u2022 None The company dominates the streaming industry with over 300 million subscribers.\n\u2022 None There's a good chance that Netflix\u2019s lofty P/E ratio will come down by 2030.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Netflix \u203a\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) has fast-forwarded investor returns. In the past five years, the global media pioneer's share price has soared 150% as of this writing. Ongoing subscriber, revenue, and operating profit growth have been the key ingredients for this perennial winner.\n\nBut where will this top streaming stock be in five years?\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nNetflix continues to fire on all cylinders. During the second quarter (ended June 30), the company reported 15.9% year-over-year revenue growth. Even better, free cash flow jumped 86.9%. Netflix is an extremely profitable enterprise these days, something many bears believed would never happen due to the company's massive content budget.\n\nThe business dominates the streaming landscape. According to Nielsen data, 8.8% of all U.S. TV viewing time in July happened on Netflix. The only other streaming platform with a greater share is YouTube, which isn't a an apples-to-apples comparison due to its user-generated content.\n\nThere's no reason to believe that Netflix's fundamentals will weaken anytime soon. In 2030, revenue and earnings should be higher than they are today. That supports a rising stock price.\n\nNetflix shares should be higher five years from now, but more importantly, will the stock be able to beat the market between now and 2030? That's a different story.\n\nValuation is the main concern I have. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 51.7. The bulls will argue that Netflix's monster success warrants the premium valuation. However, the company's growth going forward isn't going to resemble the past. There's a good chance the P/E multiple will contract over the next five years as the business continues to mature, offsetting some of the stock's gains in that time.\n\nNetflix has been a market-beating stock in the past, but looking ahead to 2030, it wouldn't surprise me if the stock lags the S&P 500.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Netflix wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $649,657!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,090,993!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,057% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500. Don\u2019t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nNeil Patel has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "text": "The price-to-earnings ratio, also known as the P/E ratio, is one of the most commonly used stock valuation metrics, and it is important for any investor to understand. In this article, we\u2019ll take a closer look at what the P/E ratio is, how to calculate it, and how to use it as part of your investment analysis.\nUnderstanding the P/E ratio\nUnderstanding the P/E ratio\nThe P/E ratio, or price-to-earnings ratio, is a metric that compares a company\u2019s net income to its stock price. It can be an excellent tool when analyzing stocks and can help investors get a sense of whether a stock is a good value or expensive.\nAs the name implies, the P/E ratio is calculated by taking the current share price of a stock and dividing by its earnings per share over a one-year period. For example, if a stock trades for $40 per share and earned $2 per share in the past year, its P/E ratio would be 20.\nYou may hear the P/E ratio also referred to as the P/E multiple or earnings multiple, and it\u2019s important to realize that these terms are often used interchangeably and mean the same thing.\nThere are several different ways to calculate the P/E ratio, with the two most common being the trailing P/E and the forward P/E. A stock\u2019s trailing P/E is calculated by using its past four quarters\u2019 earnings, while the forward P/E is calculated by using the consensus projections, or the company\u2019s own guidance, for the next 12 months of earnings.\nWhy is P/E ratio important?\nWhy is the P/E ratio important?\nThe P/E ratio is important because it is a valuation metric that is useful for comparing different investment opportunities to one another. It can be a useful tool when trying to identify undervalued stocks, and it can help you avoid overpaying for stocks as well.\nHow to use the P/E ratio\nHow to use the P/E ratio\nThe most effective way to use the P/E ratio is to compare the valuations of businesses in the same industry at similar stages of maturity. For example, you might use the P/E ratio as part of an analysis comparing Target (TGT 1.98%), Costco (COST -1.18%), and Walmart (WMT -1.18%).\nIt is also worth pointing out that the P/E ratio doesn\u2019t work on companies that aren\u2019t profitable. There are other valuation metrics that can be applied to early-stage growth companies, but the P/E ratio isn\u2019t one of them.\nNo valuation metric can tell you if a stock is an attractive investment opportunity all by itself, and the P/E ratio is no exception. For example, the stock of a faster-growing business should have a higher P/E ratio than a slower-growing one, all other factors being equal. So the P/E ratio is best used as one piece of the puzzle, in combination with earnings growth, cash and debt levels, gross and net profit margins, and other figures.\nFinally, if a stock has a P/E ratio that is much lower than its peers, it can be a red flag that is worthy of further investigation. Companies with P/E ratios that seem too good to be true often have declining sales, poor balance sheet quality, or another underlying reason for the seemingly cheap valuation.\nExample of using the P/E ratio\nExample of using the P/E ratio\nLet\u2019s take a look at a real-world example of calculating the P/E ratio. As of Feb. 6, 2023, Apple (AAPL 1.21%) traded for $154.50. Over the past four quarters, Apple earned $5.90 per share. So we can calculate its trailing P/E ratio as follows:\nSo Apple trades for 26.2 times its trailing-12-month earnings. If we wanted a more forward-looking metric, we can use Apple\u2019s projected earnings over the next 12 months, which are $6.23 per share. If we use this, our forward earnings calculation looks like:\nNow let\u2019s say that you\u2019re trying to decide between Apple and Microsoft (MSFT 0.56%). On the same date, Microsoft traded for $255.12. Its trailing-12-month earnings were $8.99 per share, so its trailing P/E ratio could be calculated as:\nApple\u2019s trailing P/E is 26.2, while Microsoft\u2019s is 28.4. Based on the P/E ratio alone, Apple appears to be the cheaper stock. However, as mentioned above, it\u2019s important to understand the P/E ratio is just one metric that should be used in stock analysis and doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\nSo when conducting an analysis of two companies like this, the best practice is to use the P/E ratio along with other metrics for both companies to develop a thorough comparison of the two investment opportunities."

      "text": "Whether you've been investing for a while or are brand new at it, you're almost certainly looking for more ways to better choose the best stocks for your portfolio. Fundamental investing (also called fundamental analysis) is a common technique that makes it easier to understand why stocks have a given value.\nWhat is fundamental investing?\nWhat is fundamental investing?\nFundamental investing, also known as fundamental analysis, is a very common way to look at stocks when you're trying to decide whether or not you want to buy them. In fundamental analysis, you're looking at the reasons why stocks have a given value. The fundamentals -- like balance sheets and industry health -- are everything in fundamental investing.\nWith fundamental analysis, your goal is to attempt to tease out the intrinsic value of a stock rather than try to figure out if it's going to go up or down. Many long-term investors tend to favor fundamental analysis so they can better understand if their company will do well for years or decades to come.\nTypes of fundamental investing\nTypes of fundamental investing\nThere are two main schools of thought when it comes to fundamental analysis. They both look at stocks in their broader context, including examining how the wider economy may influence the stock and how the company performs within its own industry. However, they approach this very differently.\nThe top-down approach of fundamental investing starts by looking at the wider economy then delves into the industry and factors that may influence it, and then finally examines a company's specific financials and management. For some types of stocks, this makes sense, especially if the industry is new, niche, or one that may not have a lot of future left (think print-only newspapers in 2001).\nThe bottom-up approach does the exact opposite, first looking at the company's health before considering anything else. This is generally best for companies that are in industries you believe are healthy and not in trouble, so you can focus on whether or not this particular company is going to be profitable in the long term.\nFundamental vs. technical investing\nFundamental investing versus technical investing\nMany stock traders have dabbled in a lot of different techniques to figure out what stocks will be winners, but the techniques generally be described as either fundamental analysis or technical analysis. The two are usually considered to be at odds, but it's honestly not uncommon to employ fundamental and technical investing together in different ways.\nFundamental analysis, as stated above, looks at the company and the economy's basic fundamentals. It's a decision as to whether or not this company and this economy are healthy from a business and economic perspective. The timeline is very long-term.\nTechnical analysis, on the other hand, focuses primarily on trade data and tries to predict future prices from past performance. Technical traders attempt to detect and isolate patterns that tend to result in increases or decreases in the value of a stock based on trades alone. Because of the type of data that's considered and how it's considered, technical analysis tends to be a shorter-term proposition and is common for day traders.\nRelated investing topics\nExample\nAn example of how fundamental investing works\nSo, let's say that you're interested in XYZ, Inc., a company that makes snack cakes. You've done your homework; you can see that the economy is healthy, and people are spending on discretionary goods and small luxuries -- a great environment for a snack cake manufacturer.\nThe snack cake industry as a whole is great; lots of snack cakes are being sold by XYZ, Inc., as well as its competitors. These manufacturers have been posting record profits for the last several quarters.\nDrilling down into XYZ, Inc., though, you see some issues. They have been taking on a lot of debt recently (not great news). Then, you discover that the debt is for a new factory because they simply cannot keep up with the demand for snack cakes (maybe good news). There's ample cash on hand, so the move could simply be to grow the company faster without sacrificing its financial pad.\nThe company has been in business for 150 years and has been in solid hands the entire time. The same family has owned it and continues to pass the torch on to leaders who share the same conservative business philosophy. They do spend some money on new product development, but their biggest sellers are traditional favorites.\nSo, between the massive increase in sales for several quarters in a row, the overall health of the snack cake industry, and the fact that XYZ's conservative leadership has decided to leverage debt to expand rapidly rather than waiting on their cash on hand to be enough to build a new factory, you decide to buy, in hopes that you'll be ahead of their future growth wave.\nThis is a very simple example of how you might examine a company using a fundamental analysis approach. The next hardest step is holding on through the bumpy years, because the stock market always has bumpy years."

      "text": "We might all wish that we'd bought shares of Netflix (NFLX -0.20%) 10 years ago. As of July 25, this category-creating enterprise has seen its stock price skyrocket 978% in the last decade. Look even further back, and the returns are truly eye-popping.\nNetflix deserves credit for completely upending the media industry. The company's success probably puts it at the top of the list as a potential addition to long-term portfolios. But it's important to gain a deeper understanding.\nHere are three things you need to know about Netflix before you buy this top streaming stock.\nBenefits of scale\nNetflix leveraged its first-mover advantage to rapidly grow its membership base in the early days of streaming, when the company was really only competing with traditional cable TV. Nowadays, Netflix is a scaled-up operator, generating $11.1 billion in revenue in the second quarter, and including more than 300 million households in its member base.\nInvesting in content and technology are huge fixed costs. This is why scale matters. Companies need to increase their revenue enough to become profitable on a consistent basis. Smaller peers have struggled with this.\nHere's where Netflix truly shines. It spends massive amounts on content -- $18 billion in cash is planned for this year -- while still producing significant earnings. Operating margin is expected to be 29.5% in 2025. And the leadership team believes free cash flow will total $8 billion to $8.5 billion.\nSuccessful strategic pivots\nIt's interesting to see how companies change over time, adapting to the shifting landscape in an effort to continue expanding. Netflix has made some smart moves, particularly in the past few years.\nIn November 2022, it introduced a cheaper ad-based tier, following what competitors were doing. This targeted a wider audience, particularly consumers who were price-sensitive. This offering is seeing robust demand.\nIn May 2023, management cracked down on households that were sharing passwords. Rivals Disney+ and HBO Max (a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery) made similar decisions after Netflix.\nAnd perhaps most notable is the company's foray into live events and live sports, a move co-founder and former CEO Reed Hastings previously said Netflix wouldn't make. The business prioritizes the economics of deals, though, ensuring they make sense from a financial perspective.\n\"We remain focused on ownable big breakthrough events,\" co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on the Q2 2025 earnings call. \"Our audiences really love them.\" Netflix owns the rights to Christmas Day NFL games, and will air the next two FIFA Women's World Cups in the U.S.\nNetflix's success at adapting over the years should encourage investors to give the management team the benefit of the doubt. Looking ahead, it's almost a certainty that the company will continue to tweak its business model to drive further growth.\nNetflix's big opportunity\nNetflix is already a winner in the streaming wars. However, there's still a sizable runway to keep the growth going. \"We also think that we are a minority of our addressable market,\" co-CEO Greg Peters said on the Q1 2025 earnings call.\nOf course, bringing on the next 100 million customers will be more challenging than it was to sign up the last 100 million -- otherwise, these people would already be subscribers. And because the biggest gains are likely to come from international markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, and Latin America (regions where people typically have lower incomes), Netflix won't be able to flex the pricing power that has worked so well in the U.S. and Canada.\nWall Street analysts believe Netflix's revenue will increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13.1% from 2024 to 2027. Over the very long term, I expect these gains to moderate into the single digits.\nIf you're thinking of buying Netflix stock, you're now familiar with its scale advantage, the evolution of its business model, and the opportunity ahead."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "Knowing who owns YouTube is becoming increasingly important as the video-sharing platform continues to attract a massive number of eyeballs, especially compared to traditional media. It hosts an eclectic array of content, from educational tutorials to personal vlogs curated by influencers.\nYouTube is known as the go-to video platform both for short- and long-term video content and is heavily influential on a global scale, from business to politics. Let's take a closer look.\nOverview\nWho owns YouTube?\nYouTube is owned by Google, which acquired the platform in November 2006 for $1.65 billion. Google is a subsidiary of Alphabet (GOOG 2.98%) (GOOGL 3.1%), a publicly traded company established in 2015 as the result of a major corporate restructuring to streamline and optimize Google's operations.\nYouTube's origins are traced back to a trio of individuals who worked at PayPal (PYPL 3.43%): Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. Inspired by an unfruitful search for a video clip, the trio had a eureka moment that inspired them to construct the foundation of what would become YouTube.\nCorporate structure\nYouTube and Alphabet's corporate structure\nWhen YouTube was originally acquired in 2006, Google itself was a publicly traded company under the same ticker Alphabet uses today for its Class A shares: GOOGL. As Google continued to expand and diversify its business away from just Google Search, it underwent a major corporate restructuring.\nAlphabet became the publicly listed parent company that now owns Google and several other notable subsidiaries, including Deep Mind, Waymo, and Calico. Alphabet is publicly traded and has three classes of shares:\n- Class A (GOOGL): Class A shares are publicly traded and come with voting rights.\n- Class B: Class B shares are not publicly traded and are held by founders and insiders. They also have 10 times the voting power of Class A shares.\n- Class C (GOOG): Class C shares are also publicly traded but do not have any voting rights.\nBoth Class A and Class C shares are publicly available and traded on stock exchanges, allowing investors to purchase them. However, because Class C shares lack voting rights, they might trade at a slight discount compared to Class A shares, though this price difference is generally quite small.\nShareholders\nLargest shareholders of YouTube and Alphabet\nIn business, it's not so much about who owns the most as who controls the most. Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have structured things so that their combined Alphabet Class B stock holdings allow them to exert 51.4% voting control of the company.\nThis is a regular setup in tech companies where founders are eager for capital but reluctant to relinquish control. It's very common for both social media stocks and streaming service stocks. A breakdown of the major shareholders as of February 2025 can be found below:\nIndividual investors\n- Larry Page owns 389,051,160 shares of Alphabet, which constitutes a 3.1% stake in the company. Page is one of the co-founders of Google and previously held the position of CEO.\n- Sergey Brin holds 363,474,028 shares, representing a 2.9% stake in the company. Brin co-founded Google alongside Larry Page and served as the company's president.\n- Eric Schmidt owns 60,994,606 shares, equivalent to a 0.5% stake. Schmidt was Google's CEO from 2001 to 2011 and later served as executive chairman until 2017.\n- L. John Doerr owns 24,290,420 shares, amounting to a 0.2% stake. Doerr is a venture capitalist and an early Google investor.\n- K. Ram Shriram owns 2,080,740 shares, which is a 0.02% stake. Shriram was a founding board member and an early Google investor.\nInstitutional investors\nA major portion of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares are held by major institutional investors like Vanguard, BlackRock (BLK 2.03%), and State Street (STT 2.68%). That's due to their extensive exchange-traded fund (ETF) and mutual fund offerings.\nThese firms manage funds that track major indexes, such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100, which include Alphabet as a significant component due to its large market capitalization and influence in the technology sector.\n- Vanguard Group owns 495.52 million Class A shares and 401.88 million Class C shares of Alphabet.\n- BlackRock owns 430.81 million Class A shares and 357.82 million Class C shares.\n- Fidelity owns 248.42 million Class A shares and 117.99 million Class C shares.\n- State Street owns 226.01 million Class A shares and 187.43 million Class C shares.\n- Geode Capital Management owns 131.94 million Class A shares and 104.78 million Class C shares. Primarily serving as a manager for Fidelity index funds, Geode's holdings in Alphabet represent a significant portion of its managed assets.\nBoard of directors\nWho is on the board of directors for YouTube?\nPage and Brin have significant voting power in Alphabet, the parent company of YouTube owner Google, and continue to serve on its board of directors despite stepping down from day-to-day management in 2019. Google's board of directors consists of the following individuals.\n| Name | Role | Shareholder % | Board Tenure | Profile | Notable Contributions |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Larry Page | Google co-founder, board member | 3.1% | Since Google's founding in 1998 | Co-founded Google, continues to serve on Alphabet's board since stepping down as its CEO in 2019 | Served as CEO of Google from 1998-2001 and 2011-2015 and as CEO of Alphabet from 2015-2019 |\n| Sergey Brin | Google co-founder, board member | 2.9% | Since Google's founding in 1998 | Co-founded Google, continues to serve on Alphabet's board since stepping down as its president in 2019 | Served as Google's president of technology from 2001-2011 and president of Alphabet from 2015 to 2019 |\n| Sundar Pichai | CEO of Alphabet and Google | 0.028% | Since December 2019 | Led key projects like Chrome and Android | Transitioned Google to Alphabet and is CEO of both Google and Alphabet |\n| John L.
