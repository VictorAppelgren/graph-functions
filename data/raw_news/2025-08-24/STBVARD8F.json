  "description": "Six years on, Coca-Cola rethinks its hot drinks strategy",
  "content": "Coffee has become a quiet drag for Coca-Cola (KO) , compelling some tough thinking behind the scenes.\n\nFor perspective, the retail giant doesn't exactly break out \u201chot beverages\u201d revenue directly. However, its Global Ventures segment, essentially a catch-all including those efforts, generated $3.13 billion in 2024, or just 6.7% of total sales.\n\nCoffee volumes in that category dropped 3% last year, too, prompting executives to effectively rethink their position as a global growth driver.\n\nThat reality is pushing Coca-Cola to rethink its bet on a beloved and visible coffee venture.\n\nCoca-Cola doesn\u2019t exactly publish a lifetime tally of all its acquisitions, but its marquee acquisitions since 2007 total north of $27 billion.\n\nAmong the most impactful acquisitions are:\n\u2022 CCE North America ($12.3 billion, 2010): The acquisition helped Coca-Cola regain U.S. bottling control, super-charging its supply chain while leading to greater efficiency in franchise optimization.\n\u2022 Glac\u00e9au/Vitaminwater ($4.1 billion, 2007): The acquisition cemented Coca-Cola\u2019s presence in premium water and functional hydration, which laid the foundation for the Smartwater and Vitaminwater lines.\n\u2022 BodyArmor ($5.6 billion, 2021): The addition built Coca-Cola\u2019s sports drink portfolio, giving it the ammunition to go toe-to-toe with Gatorade with a BodyArmor-Powerade combo.\n\nIn contrast, recent activity has been relatively muted. Coca-Cola disclosed just $315 million in acquisitions last year, and around $179 million in the first half of 2025.\n\nMost of these are related to tax-credit partnerships, underscoring a sharp pullback in M&A cadence.\n\nCoca-Cola just turned heads with the reported potential sale of its UK-based coffee chain, Costa Coffee.\n\nIn working with Lazard bankers to gauge interest, talks are already underway with a few of the bidders, including private equity firms.\n\nThe soft drinks scooped up Costa Coffee in 2018 for a whopping \u00a33.9 billion. However, in a stunning turn of events, analysts expect the deal only to fetch \u00a32 billion (a loss of nearly half its original investment).\n\nIn 2023, the chain generated \u00a31.22 billion in sales, up 9% from 2022 but still comfortably below the \u00a31.3 billion booked the year Coca-Cola scooped it up.\n\nDespite the underperformance, the brand has paid over \u00a3250 million in dividends to Coca-Cola since the acquisition.",

      "text": "Ives has been tracking tech stocks for Wall Street for over twenty years, and he's built a reputation for having his finger on the pulse of tech trends. He's currently managing director and senior equity research analyst for Wedbush Securities, and he has a 4.6 rating by TipRanks, ranking him in the top 10% of all Wall Street analysts tracked.\nHis current AI 30 list includes usual suspects like Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) , but some new names may surprise you.\nAlso, a fair few big names got booted off the list, which makes things even more interesting.\nIves' best AI stocks include market titans\nWhen it comes to investing in AI stocks, the conversation typically starts with the biggest names.\nThe best AI stocks to buy are essentially the platform leaders controlling compute, data, and distribution. Nvidia, a no-brainer pick, usually dominates accelerators and AI software ecosystems, while Microsoft and Amazon sit at the top of cloud AI adoption.\nGoogle continues to push through with its search prowess and generative AI integration, while chipmakers and AI infrastructure players like Broadcom and AMD remain critical suppliers powering the space.\nAlso, for those with a long-term investing mindset, Meta and Taiwan Semiconductor are in the mix.\nAnd what about Elon Musk\u2019s AI play? His company, xAI, behind the potent Grok chatbot, remains private, but Tesla acts as the public proxy. From the powerful Dojo supercomputer to Robotaxi ambitions and even humanoid robots, Tesla embodies Musk\u2019s AI vision in a listed form.\nSmall-cap stocks also make the AI cut\nOf course, not everyone is looking at mega-caps.\nSome investors will want to scoop up AI stocks under $10 with moonshot potential. That\u2019s a space where there\u2019s a ton of speculation, but opportunities exist as well.\nOver the past few years, companies such as BigBear.ai, SoundHound AI, and Guardforce AI typically show up in this range. They\u2019re volatile, but often provide healthy exposure to smaller, fast-moving bets on the AI trend.\nRisk management matters are as important as stock picking, which is where the 7% rule comes in.\nIt\u2019s a simple philosophy, too, in that if a stock falls 7% to 8% below your purchase price, you sell. The idea is to efficiently prevent major losses that can drag down performance while letting winners run.\nThe playbook remains clear, where the goal is to anchor portfolios in durable AI platforms and selectively use sub-$10 names for upside, while sticking to the 7% rule for discipline.\nNvidia remains the king of AI\nNvidia sits at the top of Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives' AI 30 list, and it\u2019s not hard to see why.\nThe chip giant is clearly the backbone of the AI revolution, powering everything from ChatGPT to enterprise machine learning models. Wedbush views Nvidia as a critical engine of this multi-trillion-dollar shift.\nFor perspective, the global data\u2011center electricity demand is forecasted to jump more than double by 2030, to roughly 945 TWh. That\u2019s equivalent to the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, and AI is the key driver behind this surge.\nBut Nvidia\u2019s not the only name that warrants attention.\nBefore going any deeper, though, here\u2019s the list of notable additions and removals:\nStocks added to the AI 30 list:\nCrowdStrike\nRoblox\nGE Vernova\nNebius\nIn its latest shake-up, Wedbush added CrowdStrike, Roblox, GE Vernova, and Nebius to its illustrious group of 30 AI-driven businesses.\nIves said these businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the AI revolution, backed by healthy fundamentals and emerging momentum.\nCrowdStrike is part of the list for its surging demand in cybersecurity and AI-powered protection, with Ives touting the success of its Charlotte AI platform.\nRoblox earned its place through robust developer incentives and smarter content discovery.\nAI is playing a critical role in driving user growth and monetization, potentially paying dividends in the upcoming quarters.\nWith the expansion in data centers, demand for power and grid tools grows along with it. Nebius, meanwhile, is growing fast as it looks to meet red-hot demand for its AI infrastructure, with demand still outpacing supply.\nAdditionally, Apple, Alibaba, and Baidu are already part of this elite list, and the new entrants show just how fast the AI race is evolving.\nStocks removed from the AI 30 list:\nAdobe\nC3.ai\nCyberArk\nElastic\nWith the addition of some fresh names, four tech businesses just lost their spot on the AI 30 list.\nForemost, we have Adobe, which was dropped on the back of a slower AI start than Ives had hoped for. That sluggishness is resulting in slower growth and could significantly hurt its free cash flow haul.\nCyberArk is being scooped up by Palo Alto Networks, which is already featured in the AI 30 list. That deal, which is worth $25 billion, was a big reason for the switch, which Wedbush deemed a \u201chome-run M&A deal.\u201d\nC3.ai was also removed from the list on the back of a messy sales reorganization and its CEO Thomas Siebel\u2019s resignation. The leadership shakeup raised some major questions for analysts, pointing to near-term speed bumps.\nElastic also got the boot, despite boasting strong federal contracts under its repertoire. Though Ives remains bullish, the axe was perhaps more about other tech names now pulling ahead."
