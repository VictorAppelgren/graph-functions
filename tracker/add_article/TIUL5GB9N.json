      "title": "Eric Navarro to Newsmax: Gaza City 'Half Measure' Could Escalate War",
      "summary": "U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Col. Eric Navarro cautioned that Israel’s planned offensive to seize Gaza City could spark further conflict if it remains a temporary raid rather than a full‑scale operation to eliminate Hamas. He dismissed claims that Israel is responsible for feeding Gaza’s civilians, arguing that aid is used by Hamas for propaganda. Navarro warned that the conflict will persist until Palestinian ideology shifts away from hostility toward Israel, noting that a two‑state solution is unlikely without such a change. Meanwhile, Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz has pledged to proceed with the assault despite international and domestic concerns.",
