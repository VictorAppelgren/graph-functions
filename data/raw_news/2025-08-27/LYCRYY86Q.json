  "title": "Should you draft Rashee Rice in fantasy? Suspension update, outlook for Chiefs WR",
  "description": "Rashee Rice could be a fantasy football league-winner in 2025 but is set to be suspended for six games. Is he worth the gamble in fantasy drafts?",
  "content": "Few things are more versatile than rice.\n\nIt serves as the perfect base for a burrito bowl. It's the foundation of sushi rolls. It can help save your phone from water damage. It might just help you win your fantasy football league too.\n\nRashee Rice was one of the best receivers for fantasy football purposes in 2024 before suffering a season-ending knee injury, but just like any great infomercial \u2013 wait, there's more.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs star is set to be suspended for the first six games of the 2025 NFL regular season for his involvement in a high-speed, multi-car crash in March 2024. The NFL originally set a hearing for Sept. 30, but both sides were able to agree on the number of games, allowing the absence to begin in Week 1.\n\nWith there finally being some clarity on this front, it begs the question: Should you add Rice to your team?\n\nThe decision to draft, or not draft Rice, is team-dependent and varies from league to league.\n\nOn one hand, he is the clear WR1 on the team with arguably the best quarterback in the sport. On the other hand, is it worth willingly signing up to roster a player who is set to miss nearly half of the fantasy regular season?\n\nWhile it's a small sample size, Rice was WR2 in PPR formats through three weeks before suffering a season-ending knee injury in Week 4. Whether he would continue that production for an entire season remains anyone's guess, but it was hard not to be encouraged by the early results.\n\nThe injury is one concern, but the suspension is the bigger one.\n\nIn PPR formats, Rice's average draft position (ADP) is currently WR26 and around 58th overall, according to FantasyPros. It puts him just ahead of receivers like the Panthers' Tetairoa McMillan and the Titans' Calvin Ridley \u2013 who check in at WR28 and WR29, respectively.\n\nBoth McMillan and Ridley possess prominent roles in their offenses, with the potential to break out with good quarterback play. They are much better options if you prefer to avoid the fallout from suspension.\n\nIf you decide to take the plunge into the Rice market, however, there is still plenty of fantasy value at a deep receiver position to help you get through the suspension. Ricky Pearsall and Emeka Egbuka project as solid options that can be taken in Rounds 7-8, based on current ADP.\n\nThe idea of drafting a potential top-10 fantasy receiving option at a discount is undoubtedly attractive, but only if your team can afford the risk \u2013 and that depends on how your draft is going.\n\nVerdict: Rice is no doubt a top-tier fantasy receiver and having some clarity on his suspension is a bonus. He won't miss the fantasy playoffs because of it. However, you have to get there first. If your leaguemates are down on the receiver's value, scoop him up to ride your bench for the first six weeks \u2013 provided you aren't rolling out a depleted group at WR or RB.",

      "text": "Who should be No. 1 pick in fantasy football? Ranking 5 best options\nIn the actual NFL draft, NFL teams always want the No. 1 overall pick. In fantasy football drafts, the desire of fantasy managers varies.\nSome prefer to have the top selection, as it gives them their preferred target atop the draft. Others would rather draft near the end of the snake and get an earlier pick in the second round.\nAs such, the No. 1 overall fantasy pick can be viewed as either a blessing or a curse. But either way, fantasy managers need to make sure they get the pick right. If they don't, their roster depth will suffer as a result.\nWho are the best options for the top fantasy selection this season? Below is a look at the only five players fantasy football managers should consider taking atop the draft, starting with a running back who was a league-winner for many last season.\n2025 POSITION RANKINGS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K | D/ST | Overall\nNo. 1 pick options in fantasy football\n1. Saquon Barkley, RB, Philadelphia Eagles\nBarkley was the top fantasy running back last year as he generated just the ninth 2,000-yard rushing season in NFL history. He figures to once again be a highly productive runner after averaging 3.8 yards before contact per carry \u2014 a whopping 0.5 yards better than any other running back \u2014 behind a stellar Philadelphia offensive line.\nThe only concern with Barkley? He had a league-high 378 touches during the regular season and added another 104 to his ledger in the postseason. Since 2010, running backs with at least 337 touches in a season have seen an average decline of 113.9 PPR points, and 3.9 fewer PPR points per game, the following season.\n2. Ja'Marr Chase, WR, Cincinnati Bengals\nChase won the receiving Triple Crown in 2024, leading the league in catches (127), yards (1,708) and touchdowns (17). He could certainly do it again, given the chemistry he has shown with long-time teammate Joe Burrow and the Bengals' high-volume passing attack.\nReceiver production is generally more consistent year-to-year than running back production, so few would fault anyone for taking Chase No. 1 overall, especially in PPR leagues. But in half-PPR or standard formats, it is difficult to pass on a high-end running back given how quickly top-tier talents at the position come off the board in snake drafts.\n3. Bijan Robinson, RB, Atlanta Falcons\nOnly two running backs had more catches than Robinson's 61 in 2024: De'Von Achane (78) and Alvin Kamara (68). That gives Robinson one of the highest PPR floors among fantasy running backs, and his on-the-ground production (1,456 yards, 14 touchdowns) is nothing to sneeze at, either.\nLike Barkley, Robinson surpassed the dreaded 337-touch mark in 2024 with 365. Robinson, 23, is much younger than the 28-year-old Barkley, which might aid him in avoiding a decline. However, he also plays in a more volatile offense that will be entrusting second-year QB Michael Penix Jr. as a full-time starter for the first time.\n4. Jahmyr Gibbs, RB, Detroit Lions\nGibbs showed fantasy managers his potential as a workhorse over the final three weeks of the 2024 NFL season. With David Montgomery out, Gibbs averaged 25.7 touches and 162.3 total yards per game while scoring six total touchdowns.\nWhile Gibbs' ceiling is that of the No. 1 overall fantasy running back, Montgomery still figures to eat into his workload. Montgomery's size (5-11, 224 pounds) will likely make him Dan Campbell's preferred goal-line option. That might limit Gibbs' upside, but it's worth noting he had the fewest touches (302) among the consensus top-three fantasy running backs for 2025.\n5. Justin Jefferson, WR, Minnesota Vikings\nJefferson has only once finished worse than the No. 6-rated wide receiver in fantasy. That came in 2023, when he played just 10 games because of a hamstring injury. As long as Jefferson remains healthy, he should be one of the best fantasy football wide receivers, which puts him in the running for the No. 1 overall pick.\nStill, Jefferson seems more likely to be an early-to-mid first-round selection. The Vikings are breaking in a first-year starter at quarterback, J.J. McCarthy, so any early growing pains could impact Jefferson out of the gate. So, too, could a mild hamstring strain that is keeping Jefferson out of the early stages of Minnesota's training camp."

      "text": "Top fantasy football value picks at every position in 2025 drafts\nFantasy football is all about finding advantages with extra value in your picks.\nManagers across all league formats are looking for players who will outperform their draft positions. A productive first-round pick is the simplest way to contending year-in and year-out. It's a pick made in the later rounds that plays like a top five-to-10 player at their position that can make a championship team.\nIt's tough to accurately predict which players will outplay their draft position in fantasy football. If it were easy, everyone would win championships. There are some common ways that players outshine expectations on a regular basis, though.\nRookies can provide opportunity for value, depending on their landing spot and the talent or coaching around them. Players can take a step in their second year in the league or with a new coordinator or play-calling head coach. A rough situation a year ago can give way to better conditions thanks to roster changes as well.\nWe've come up with a dozen players and units who could be great value picks this season. With one exception, all of them are ranked lower than 70th overall in average draft position (ADP) by FantasyPros. These aren't the players you're expecting to get in Rounds 1-5; these are the later-round players who could make a huge difference in value this season.\nQB C.J. Stroud, Houston Texans\n- FantasyPros ADP: QB17, OVR130\nAn incredible rookie season in 2023 had Stroud up to QB5 by FantasyPros' rankings ahead of the 2024 season. As the offense stalled out, Stroud finished as QB18 in fantasy football, a step down from his QB11 finish in 2023.\nThere's been a lot of change this offseason in Houston. He'll have a new offensive coordinator in Nick Caley who spent the last two years in Los Angeles on the Rams' coaching staff. The offensive line will have multiple new starters, as will the receiving corps with free agent additions and top draft picks alike.\nEven as things change around him, Stroud has a top-10 wide receiver in Nico Collins to rely on. If Caley can bring the offense back to a top-half of the league unit, Stroud will be the catalyst for it and should finish much better than QB17.\nQB Michael Penix Jr., Atlanta Falcons\n- FantasyPros ADP: QB23, OVR153\nPenix had some flashes as a rookie down the stretch in Atlanta last season. He will have a full offseason as the starter under his belt with the Falcons and their dynamic offensive weapons headlined by Drake London and Bijan Robinson.\nAtlanta had one of the best rushing attacks in the NFL last year and should be solid in that area once again. It's down to Penix to make the most of the passing game. Atlanta should have an easy schedule of defenses this season including the Panthers and Saints twice. He's being drafted as a low-end QB2 by ADP but, with the continuity and supporting cast around him, could conceivably make it to high-end QB2 or low-end QB1 by season's end.\nRB RJ Harvey, Denver Broncos\n- FantasyPros ADP: RB25, OVR52\nHarvey is the lone exception to the ADP below 75th, but he's around RB25 in most formats. That makes him a low-end RB2 entering the season despite playing for one of the top offensive minds in Sean Payton.\nDenver spent a second-round pick on Harvey. That's no small investment at running back. He should get a large share of carries even with veteran J.K. Dobbins in the building. His receiving skills out of the backfield should increase his value even more in half- and full-PPR formats as Payton likes to involve his backs in the passing game.\nRB Miles Sanders, Dallas Cowboys\n- FantasyPros ADP: RB64, OVR208\nTo balance the Harvey pick out we offer the second-lowest overall ADP on this list. Sanders is one of two veterans vying for a starting role in the Dallas backfield. Javonte Williams could be the starter, but his injury history causes some concern.\nThat could be to Sanders' gain, at least early on. The Cowboys brought in new offensive coordinator Klayton Adams who had a prominent role in one of the top rushing attacks in the league in recent years in Arizona. Rookies Jaydon Blue and Phil Mafah might take time to have an impact on late and early downs, respectively. That leaves the door open for Sanders to have a role that far outranks his current draft position.\nWR Jaylen Waddle, Miami Dolphins\n- FantasyPros ADP: WR31, OVR73\nTyreek Hill is two years removed from leading the NFL in receiving yards and touchdowns and is entering his age-31 season. In 2024, Hill failed to reach 1,000 yards as a starter for the first time without missing any games for injury.\nThat's all to say the torch could be passed to Waddle more than before in 2025. With quarterback Tua Tagovailoa missing time, Waddle also struggled and failed to reach 1,000 yards for the first time in his career. He should bounce back in 2025 and could get a bigger target share with tight end Jonnu Smith (111 targets in 2024, second to Hill) no longer on the team.\nWR Stefon Diggs, New England Patriots\n- FantasyPros ADP: WR42, OVR91\nDiggs' 2024 season ended early with a significant knee injury but he seems to be healthy as the preseason approaches. The Athletic's Chad Graff observed in camp that \"if he can stay healthy, another 1,000-yard season isn\u2019t just in play but might be likely.\"\nDiggs is in the decline of his career considering that injury and his age (he'll turn 32 years old this season). Still, considering the dearth of proven weapons in New England and the current receiver hierarchy, Diggs should be the No. 1 target in the passing game. That's enough opportunity to see him outplay this draft spot.\nWR Ricky Pearsall, San Francisco 49ers\n- FantasyPros ADP: WR48, OVR100\nOutside of tight end George Kittle, target distribution in the passing game is unclear in San Francisco. Brandon Aiyuk won't be ready by Week 1 and that leaves Pearsall and Jauan Jennings to pick up the slack among the pass-catchers.\nPearsall's come back from an early hamstring tweak to be one of the stars in training camp for the 49ers. He's getting a lot of attention in the passing game from quarterback Brock Purdy, especially as Jennings deals with a calf injury. Pearsall could absolutely out-perform his draft position at least until Aiyuk returns midseason.\nWR Emeka Egbuka, Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n- FantasyPros ADP: WR52, OVR117\nEgbuka was one of the top wide receiver prospects in the 2025 NFL Draft. He's one of the most pro-ready of the group with the skillset to contribute from the slot as a rookie. He may have a great opportunity to do so in year one.\nTampa Bay's touted one of the better wide receiver duos in the league for years with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. The former is entering his age-32 season in the NFL and the latter is recovering from a devastating ankle injury that required a second surgery this offseason. Godwin's absence has given Egbuka more opportunity to shine in training camp and he has. His ceiling as capped at likely a high-end WR3 at best but he could absolutely outplay his current ADP.\nTE Jonnu Smith, Pittsburgh Steelers\n- FantasyPros ADP: TE11, OVR108\nSmith had a career-high 111 targets in Miami with inconsistent quarterback play due to Tua Tagovailoa missing multiple games. There's a chance he could eclipse that in Pittsburgh as he's been reunited with his former coach Arthur Smith, now the Steelers' offensive coordinator.\nTrade acquisition DK Metcalf is the Steelers' top weapon on offense but we've seen him in Seattle allow for more than one fantasy-relevant pass-catcher around him. Smith's rapport with Arthur Smith could be key at a top-heavy position. There's a cliff after the top five or six players at the position when it comes to expectations entering 2025.\nTE Zach Ertz, Washington Commanders\n- FantasyPros ADP: TE17, OVR158\nErtz was one of many veterans in Washington to benefit from Jayden Daniels' arrival in 2024. The three-time Pro Bowl tight end had 654 yards and seven touchdowns, his best year since 2021.\nHe enters 2025 with good value due to the contract standoff between Washington and top wide receiver Terry McLaurin. That could drag well into the preseason and keep McLaurin from getting valuable reps and cause him to start slow to the year. That could give Ertz a bigger portion of the targets and a chance to sustain that through the season.\nSan Francisco 49ers D/ST\n- FantasyPros ADP: D/ST10, OVR200\nThe 49ers were the third-best defense in fantasy football in 2022. In the two seasons since, they dropped to 10th in 2023 then 25th in 2024, their lowest ranking since 2018. That looked appropriate given what happened on the field as well.\nSan Francisco invested heavily into the draft to turn the tide. Rookie defensive linemen Mykel Williams, Alfred Collins and CJ West should all see significant playing time this season in a turnaround year for the franchise. But what really makes them such a value play is their schedule. San Francisco faces the easiest schedule by 2024 winning percentage in the league in 2025. They'll play the NFC South and AFC South teams as well as the Browns, Bears and Giants. That's a cushy schedule featuring plenty of first-time play-calling head coaches or rookie quarterbacks.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers D/ST\n- FantasyPros ADP: D/ST15, OVR220\nTampa Bay also has one of the easier schedules when it comes to opposing offenses thanks to playing the Panthers and Saints twice each. The Buccaneers also take on the AFC East this year which includes the Patriots and Jets.\nThe Buccaneers added depth at cornerback in the draft and added in free agency at edge rusher with Haason Reddick. Even if the talent isn't top-tier, the coaching is with Todd Bowles calling plays on that side of the ball.\nAll the NFL news on and off the field. Sign up for USA TODAY's 4th and Monday newsletter."

      "text": "Fantasy football top 200 overall players for the 2025 season\nAugust is an important month in fantasy football. Maybe the most important month.\nIt's when position battles take place during training camp. When exhibition games get teams out on the field against each other. It's also when injuries, unfortunately, start to mount. And it's when average fantasy draft positions begin to take shape.\nOf course, every fantasy draft is different, and a value pick in one league can just as easily be a reach in another. That's why ADPs and predraft rankings should be used as a tool, not a rule.\nWith that in mind, here are some thoughts about the top overall players in fantasy football for 2025.\n2025 POSITION RANKINGS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K | D/ST\nFantasy football rankings: Top overall players\nObviously, a fantasy league's format greatly affects how players are valued. Most leagues out there start one quarterback and award points for receptions. So these overall rankings are geared toward half-point PPR scoring. Let's analyze them in chunks (updated Aug. 20).\n- WR Ja'Marr Chase, Bengals\n- RB Bijan Robinson, Falcons\n- RB Saquon Barkley, Eagles\n- WR Justin Jefferson, Vikings\n- RB Jahmyr Gibbs, Lions\n- WR CeeDee Lamb, Cowboys\n- WR Amon-Ra St. Brown, Lions\n- WR Puka Nacua, Rams\n- WR Malik Nabers, Giants\n- RB Derrick Henry, Ravens\n- WR Nico Collins, Texans\n- RB De'Von Achane, Dolphins\n- Elite running backs are most valuable at the top of the draft, but there is a wealth of high-volume wide receivers among the overall top 12. Malik Nabers may be the biggest risk-reward first-round pick.\n- RB Ashton Jeanty, Raiders\n- WR A.J. Brown, Eagles\n- RB Christian McCaffrey, 49ers\n- TE Brock Bowers, Raiders\n- WR Brian Thomas Jr., Jaguars\n- WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks\n- RB Chase Brown, Bengals\n- RB Jonathan Taylor, Colts\n- WR Ladd McConkey, Chargers\n- TE Trey McBride, Cardinals\n- RB Kyren Williams, Rams\n- RB Bucky Irving, Buccaneers\n- How good can rookie Ashton Jeanty be? Better than established veterans such as Christian McCaffrey and Jonathan Taylor? Yeah, he can. Brock Bowers and Trey McBride are worth second-round picks at tight end.\n- QB Lamar Jackson, Ravens\n- WR Drake London, Falcons\n- QB Jalen Hurts, Eagles\n- QB Jayden Daniels, Commanders\n- RB Josh Jacobs, Packers\n- QB Josh Allen, Bills\n- WR Terry McLaurin, Commanders\n- WR Tyreek Hill, Dolphins\n- WR Tee Higgins, Bengals\n- RB Breece Hall, Jets\n- TE George Kittle, 49ers\n- WR Mike Evans, Buccaneers\n- If you want a top quarterback, get him in Round 3. Also, Drake London seems to mark a new tier of wide receiver here.\n- RB James Cook, Bills\n- WR Davante Adams, Rams\n- WR Garrett Wilson, Jets\n- RB Kenneth Walker III, Seahawks\n- WR DJ Moore, Bears\n- RB James Conner, Cardinals\n- WR Marvin Harrison Jr., Cardinals\n- WR DeVonta Smith, Eagles\n- RB Alvin Kamara, Saints\n- WR Courtland Sutton, Broncos\n- WR DK Metcalf, Steelers\n- WR Jameson Williams, Lions\n- RB Chuba Hubbard, Panthers\n- WR Zay Flowers, Ravens\n- Try to land at least a couple wide receivers in the top 50 picks.\n- RB Omarion Hampton, Chargers\n- RB Aaron Jones Sr., Vikings\n- QB Joe Burrow, Bengals\n- WR Xavier Worthy, Chiefs\n- RB David Montgomery, Lions\n- TE Sam LaPorta, Lions\n- RB D'Andre Swift, Bears\n- WR Chris Godwin, Buccaneers\n- RB RJ Harvey, Broncos\n- WR Jerry Jeudy, Browns\n- This is a good part of the draft to speculate on running backs \u2014 or get your first one if you subscribe to the Zero RB strategy. Will Sam LaPorta last this long?\n- QB Kyler Murray, Cardinals\n- QB Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs\n- WR Rome Odunze, Bears\n- RB Tony Pollard, Titans\n- RB Kaleb Johnson, Steelers\n- TE T.J. Hockenson, Vikings\n- RB Isiah Pacheco, Chiefs\n- WR George Pickens, Cowboys\n- WR Tetairoa McMillan, Panthers\n- RB Tyrone Tracy Jr., Giants\n- RB TreVeyon Henderson, Patriots\n- WR Jaylen Waddle, Dolphins\n- Rashee Rice, Chiefs\n- Finding some WR gold here is definitely possible. Also, could one team possibly land both Patrick Mahomes AND Travis Kelce at this point in the draft?\n- TE Travis Kelce, Chiefs\n- Joe Mixon, Texans\n- RB Jaylen Warren, Steelers\n- QB Baker Mayfield, Buccaneers\n- WR Jakobi Meyers, Raiders\n- WR Calvin Ridley, Titans\n- QB Brock Purdy, 49ers\n- RB Najee Harris, Chargers\n- WR Chris Olave, Saints\n- TE Evan Engram, Broncos\n- RB Brian Robinson Jr., Commanders\n- TE Mark Andrews, Ravens\n- WR Ricky Pearsall, 49ers\n- RB Travis Etienne Jr., Jaguars\n- Waiting on quarterbacks any later than this can turn into a high-stakes game of chicken.\n- QB Dak Prescott, Cowboys\n- WR Khalil Shakir, Bills\n- QB Bo Nix, Broncos\n- WR Travis Hunter, Jaguars\n- RB Javonte Williams, Cowboys\n- WR Jauan Jennings, 49ers\n- TE David Njoku, Browns\n- WR Cooper Kupp, Seahawks\n- QB Jared Goff, Lions\n- RB Jerome Ford, Browns\n- RB Zach Charbonnet, Seahawks\n- QB Justin Herbert, Chargers\n- WR Jayden Reed, Packers\n- RB Rhamondre Stevenson, Patriots\n- QB C.J. Stroud, Texans\n- QB Justin Fields, Jets\n- At this point, give serious consideration to talented rookies and players who've changed teams in the offseason.\n- TE Dalton Kincaid, Bills\n- WR Stefon Diggs, Patriots\n- QB J.J. McCarthy, Vikings\n- WR Deebo Samuel Sr., Commanders\n- WR Matthew Golden, Packers\n- TE Tucker Kraft, Packers\n- TE Jake Ferguson, Cowboys\n- QB Caleb Williams, Bears\n- RB Rachaad White, Buccaneers\n- WR Emeka Egbuka, Buccaneers\n- WR Jordan Addison, Vikings\n- RB Tank Bigsby, Jaguars\n- RB Jordan Mason, Vikings\n- QB Drake Maye, Patriots\n- RB Tyjae Spears, Titans\n- WR Josh Downs, Colts\n- WR Michael Pittman Jr., Colts\n- TE Kyle Pitts, Falcons\n- TE Hunter Henry, Patriots\n- QB Jordan Love, Packers\n- WR Darnell Mooney, Falcons\n- RB Cam Skattebo, Giants\n- RB Tyler Allgeier, Falcons\n- WR Rashid Shaheed, Saints\n- QB Bryce Young, Panthers\n- RB J.K. Dobbins, Broncos\n- RB Isaac Guerendo, 49ers\n- WR Keon Coleman, Bills\n- Players with raw talent and plausible upside \u2014 even if they don't have a major role just yet \u2014 are great picks here in the middle rounds.\n- QB Trevor Lawrence, Jaguars\n- RB Quinshon Judkins, Browns\n- WR Wan'Dale Robinson, Giants\n- WR Rashod Bateman, Ravens\n- TE Tyler Warren, Colts\n- QB Michael Penix Jr., Falcons\n- WR Jayden Higgins, Texans\n- TE Dallas Goedert, Eagles\n- RB Bhayshul Tuten, Jaguars\n- WR Luther Burden III, Bears\n- RB Rico Dowdle, Panthers\n- TE Jonnu Smith, Steelers\n- RB Austin Ekeler, Commanders\n- RB Ray Davis, Bills\n- QB Tua Tagovailoa, Dolphins\n- RB Jaylen Wright Dolphins\n- WR Brandon Aiyik, 49ers\n- WR Adam Thielen, Panthers\n- DST Philadelphia Eagles\n- It's all personal preference as we come to the end of the top 150. Pick your favorites and grab them, regardless of where they rank.\n- RB Trey Benson, Cardinals\n- QB Matthew Stafford, Rams\n- WR Marvin Mims Jr., Broncos\n- TE Isiah Likely, Ravens\n- RB Jaydon Blue, Cowboys\n- RB Braelon Allen, Jets\n- TE Colston Loveland, Bears\n- QB Aaron Rodgers, Steelers\n- RB Roschon Johnson, Bears\n- D/ST Baltimore Ravens\n- Time to start thinking about the top defenses/special teams.\n- RB Nick Chubb, Texans\n- WR Tre' Harris, Chargers\n- RB MarShawn Lloyd, Packers\n- WR Christian Kirk, Texans\n- WR Quentin Johnston, Chargers\n- D/ST Denver Broncos\n- WR Alec Pierce, Colts\n- RB Blake Corum, Rams\n- WR DeAndre Hopkins, Ravens\n- D/ST Pittsburgh Steelers\n- D/ST Houston Texans\n- TE Cade Otton, Buccaneers\n- WR Marquise Brown, Chiefs\n- RB Justice Hill, Ravens\n- WR Jalen McMillan, Buccaneers\n- RB Chris Rodriguez Jr., Commanders\n- WR Cedric Tillman, Browns\n- QB Cam Ward, Titans\n- WR Romeo Doubs, Packers\n- TE Pat Freiermuth, Steelers\n- RB Keaton Mitchell, Ravens\n- D/ST Seattle Seahawks\n- WR Kyle Williams, Patriots\n- D/ST Minnesota Vikings\n- D/ST Buffalo Bills\n- K Brandon Aubrey, Cowboys\n- D/ST Green Bay Packers\n- RB Ty Johnson, Bills\n- RB Dylan Sampson, Browns\n- D/ST Detroit Lions\n- D/ST Kansas City Chiefs\n- RB Kyle Monangai, Bears\n- K Cameron Dicker, Chargers\n- K Jake Bates, Lions\n- DST New York Jets\n- WR Xavier Legette, Panthers\n- TE Zach Ertz, Commanders\n- K Chase McLaughlin, Buccaneers\n- WR DeMario Douglas, Patriots\n- WR Joshua Palmer, Bills"

      "text": "Fantasy football players to avoid at every position in 2025 drafts\nIt's a tale as old as fantasy football. A top-20 player goes early in a snake draft or for big money in auction leagues only to finish far below expectations. With just enough bad luck down the rest of the lineup, this can lead fantasy managers to worry more about last-place punishments than holiday plans once December rolls around.\nIt's a tough task trying to predict which high-profile fantasy players will fall short in the upcoming season. If it were easy, everyone would've known to draft then-backup Chase Brown over reigning Offensive Player of the Year Christian McCaffrey this time last year.\nLet's highlight one player at each position who could fall well short of expectations or may be too risky to take a chance on. This is not to say these players won't be successful this season. We're just concerned about how high their ceilings can be for one reason or another.\nHere are our players to avoid this season:\nQB Anthony Richardson Sr., Indianapolis Colts\n- FantasyPros ADP: QB26, OVR179\nRichardson's average draft position (ADP) makes sense given how risky a pick he is. The sheer talent is tantalizing; he has game-breaking athleticism and the arm strength to have a high ceiling in fantasy football.\nHe's played just 15 games over his first two seasons, though. Forgive us for being skeptical he can eclipse that total this season. With Daniel Jones in the building as a backup or competitor for the starting position in a make-or-break season for coach Shane Steichen, Richardson could have a very short leash if things start to go wrong. Best to avoid him entirely.\nRB Tyrone Tracy Jr., New York Giants\n- FantasyPros ADP: RB30, OVR80 (half-PPR leagues)\nTracy was a pleasant surprise as a rookie in 2024 for a struggling Giants offense. This is less about him as a singular talent and more to do with the environment around him.\nNew York has three quarterbacks who could end up playing significant snaps at some point this season, starting with Russell Wilson. The 36-year-old Wilson is operating behind an offensive line led by left tackle Andrew Thomas but lacking elsewhere.\nThere's also the matter of the schedule. New York faces a brutal slate of opposing defenses this year. Of the 14 teams they'll face, half of them were top-10 scoring defenses. Tracy's currently a Round 6-7 pick by ADP; we'd recommend waiting until later to take him, if at all.\nWR DK Metcalf, Pittsburgh Steelers\n- FantasyPros ADP: WR21, OVR48 (half-PPR leagues)\nLike Tracy, this has a lot to do with Metcalf's environment. He's the top target in Pittsburgh but he'll have a 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers throwing him the ball. That's not the best combination for a wide receiver whose game is predicated on downfield speed.\nThen there's offensive play-caller Arthur Smith. In his previous six years, his teams' best finish in passing offense was 16th. He's finished 21st or worse in every other year. The last player to have a 1,000-yard receiving season under Smith was Atlanta's Kyle Pitts in 2021.\nSmith wants to run the ball. Rodgers is an aging quarterback. That's not a recipe for success.\nTE Mark Andrews, Baltimore Ravens\n- FantasyPros ADP: TE7, OVR76 (half-PPR leagues)\nAndrews was either TE5 or TE6 in fantasy football across all formats last season, thanks mostly to a position-high 11 touchdowns. It might be a surprise to see him on this list.\nAndrews struggled in the Ravens' playoff loss to the Bills last season, but it's not the sour taste from that game that has him here. Andrews had as many touchdowns in 2024 than he did in his prior two seasons combined.\nHe had the fewest targets (69) of any top 10 tight end from 2024. If he maintained his yardage total but had seven touchdowns instead of 11 (still a good season), Andrews drops from TE5 or TE6 to TE9 or TE10. Even with Isaiah Likely's health concerns in preseason, touchdown regression is likely coming for Andrews, making his ADP too rich for our blood.\nK Chase McLaughlin, Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n- FantasyPros ADP: K5, OVR232\nMcLaughlin benefited from one of the most productive and efficient offenses in the NFL last season to finish as the No. 6 kicker in fantasy football. That was up from 16th in 2023.\nThis is less about McLaughlin's ability and more about questions surrounding the Buccaneers offense. For the third time in as many years, the offense has a new coordinator. Josh Grizzard was promoted to the role this offseason but there are rightfully some questions about whether he can keep things going.\nPittsburgh Steelers D/ST\n- FantasyPros ADP: D/ST3, OVR169\nPittsburgh finished as the fourth-best D/ST in fantasy football last season. That was impressive given multiple starters missed time, notably edge rusher Alex Highsmith.\nOur reservations about making the Steelers a top-five defense have to do with age and schedule.\nT.J. Watt signed an extension this offseason but he's entering his age-31 season and registered 11.5 sacks last season. For most players, that'd be a standout total. For Watt, it's the lowest in a healthy season of his career. The team traded safety Minkah Fitzpatrick for cornerback Jalen Ramsey, who is two years older. The other cornerback starting opposite Joey Porter Jr. is 34-year-old Darius Slay.\nOf the 14 teams Pittsburgh will face this year, six were top-10 scoring offenses in 2024. Two of those teams are divisional foes (Baltimore and Cincinnati). Scoring offense is less volatile than scoring defense and could make things tough on the Steelers in 2025 for what's being drafted as a top-three unit."

      "text": "Fantasy football draft strategy 2025: 4 keys to nailing your draft\n- Ja\u2019Marr Chase is the consensus No. 1 pick in fantasy football drafts this preseason.\n- The 2025 rookie running back class is strong, with several players projected to be significant fantasy contributors.\n- There\u2019s a noticeable gap between the top five quarterbacks and the rest.\nHeading into a new NFL season, it isn\u2019t easy to try and catch up all at once.\nFor starters, there are seven new head coaches and many new offensive systems hoping to give skill players fresh starts around the league. Fantasy football managers have to account for all that as they formulate their own draft strategies and lock in on the key performers who can lead them to a championship.\nBut where to start?\nObviously, the best place to start is at the beginning \u2013 because everyone wants to know how the first round of this year\u2019s drafts is likely to unfold.\n2025 POSITION RANKINGS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K | D/ST\nWho do you take in Round 1?\nWhen there\u2019s nothing but last year\u2019s stats to shape our opinions, gravity pulls us toward the familiar. So it\u2019s no surprise Bengals wideout Ja\u2019Marr Chase is the consensus No. 1 pick this preseason. He won the receiving triple crown a year ago, leading the league in receptions, yards and touchdown catches.\nThis time last year, a seemingly healthy Christian McCaffrey, along with top wideout Tyreek Hill and emerging star Breece Hall were prime picks at the top of drafts following their strong performances in 2023. But we know now how quickly things went south for all three.\nThat\u2019s not to say that Chase isn\u2019t a deserving selection with the first overall pick. It\u2019s just a reminder that nothing\u2019s guaranteed. A credible case can be made for Saquon Barkley, Justin Jefferson, Bijan Robinson or Jahmyr Gibbs at No. 1.\nJudging from the way drafts have gone this preseason, those five appear to be in a class of their own. (With CeeDee Lamb occasionally sneaking into the elite tier.) The bottom line: Get a top-five (or six) pick, get a franchise cornerstone. Seems pretty simple.\nDepth abounds at wide receiver\nBut what if you\u2019re picking in the middle or at the end of the first round?\nIn that case, you might want to consider how your first two selections will mesh.\nWhile running backs were plentiful in the first two rounds last year, receivers seem to have the upper hand in 2025 drafts. In our rankings, seven of the top 11 overall players are wide receivers.\nOne reason the receiver pool might seem particularly deep stems from the strength of last year\u2019s fantastic rookie class, one that produced seven selections in the NFL draft\u2019s first round (and two more to start the second).\nSophomores Malik Nabers, Brian Thomas Jr. and Ladd McConkey are now solidly being taken in the first two rounds of 2025 fantasy drafts, with Xavier Worthy, Rome Odunze, Ricky Pearsall and Marvin Harrison, Jr. all expected to take a step forward.\nWith so many NFL teams deploying three- and even four-wideout sets, the overall receiving depth is excellent. Last season, there were 34 wide receivers who averaged more than 12 PPR fantasy points per game (minimum nine games).\nRookie RBs bolster this year's options\nWe may have a similar bumper crop of rookies in 2025 \u2013 only this time it\u2019s at running back.\nWhile NFL GMs are more than willing to spend a high draft pick on a receiver or quarterback, first-round running backs have become extremely rare. There were none a year ago, and just two in 2023. Although to be fair, those two just happen to be Bijan Robinson and Jahmyr Gibbs \u2013 who are now top-five picks in fantasy drafts.\nSo how high should expectations be for Ashton Jeanty, whom the Las Vegas Raiders selected at No. 6 overall?\nJeanty figures to be an every-down back under new head coach Pete Carroll. And his track record of being a workhorse in college bodes well for his usage as a pro. For that reason, Jeanty\u2019s a borderline first-rounder in fantasy \u2013 despite the Raiders being a bottom-6 offense in both yards and scoring a year ago.\nHe\u2019s far from the only rookie back who could be a significant fantasy contributor. Omarion Hampton (taken 22nd overall) is poised to open the season as the starter in a run-first Los Angeles Chargers offense.\nMeanwhile, RJ Harvey (Broncos), Kaleb Johnson (Steelers), TreVeyon Henderson (Patriots), Cam Skattebo (Giants), Quinshon Judkins (Browns), Jaydon Blue (Cowboys) and Bhayshul Tuten (Jaguars) offer intriguing upside as they learn their teams\u2019 offensive playbooks.\nRounds 4-7 seem to be the sweet spot for nabbing one of these lottery tickets.\nDare take a top QB, TE early?\nAnother trend we\u2019re seeing in drafts so far is a distinct gap at the top of the rankings at both quarterback and tight end.\nA popular way to construct a draft cheat sheet is by breaking down each position into tiers \u2013 grouping similar players together and identifying where the divisions in talent level take a noticeable drop.\nThis year, there seems to be an even greater difference than usual between the best and the rest at these two positions.\nAt quarterback, there\u2019s a clear top five, with all of them going roughly between the 23rd and 40th overall pick. (Average draft position from NFFC as of Aug. 18.)\n- Lamar Jackson (Overall ADP: 23.5)\n- Josh Allen (24.6)\n- Joe Burrow (31.2)\n- Jayden Daniels (33.2)\n- Jalen Hurts (39.5)\nAfter them, Patrick Mahomes is the next-highest drafted quarterback with an ADP of 59.6.\nThe same is true with the top tight ends.\n- Brock Bowers (Overall ADP: 18.9)\n- Trey McBride (26.7)\n- George Kittle (43.5)\nFrom there, it\u2019s another 20-plus spots to No. 4 Sam LaPorta (64.7), then another big gap to No. 5 T.J. Hockenson (80.9).\nIt\u2019s certainly okay to wait a while on one or both positions \u2013 especially when those elite options are off the board. But if your game plan is to roster a top quarterback or tight end, you will likely need to pull the trigger by Round 4.\nAt the same time, resist the temptation to get a top-tier quarterback and tight end in the early rounds. There is ample depth at both positions \u2013 and in leagues that only start one of each, the cost of passing on highly productive running backs and wide receivers at that spot could torpedo your draft."

      "text": "Chiefs WR Rashee Rice suspended six games for involvement in car crash, per reports\nThe NFL has doled out its punishment for Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice.\nThe league is suspending Rice for six games for his involvement in a high-speed car crash in March 2024, according to multiple reports. The NFL and NFL Players Association are working to finalize the punishment, NFL Media's Tom Pelissero reported, and Rice will not appeal the decision.\nRice pleaded guilty July 17 to two third-degree felony charges: collision involving serious bodily injury, and racing on a highway causing bodily injury. The charges stemmed from a high-speed car crash involving Rice last March, and a Dallas district court judge sentenced him to 30 days in jail and five years of probation.\nThe Dallas District Attorney's Office noted in a statement that Rice paid more than $115,000 in \"restitution to all the victims for their out-of-pocket medical expenses\" before agreeing to his plea deal.\nRice, the Chiefs' 2023 second-round pick, missed all but four games of the 2024 season after suffering a knee injury in a collision with quarterback Patrick Mahomes in Week 4. He tallied 288 yards and two touchdowns on 24 catches prior to the injury.\nAfter the NFL's disciplinary decision, Rice will have to wait a few games longer before making his return."

Auction values (AV) are according to TheHuddle.com and are based on 12 teams and a $200 cap.\nTip: Check out the auction values column to see how players at each position can be separated into tiers.

      "text": "Fantasy football rankings: Sleeper picks for every position in 2025\nMaximizing value is the name of the game in fantasy football. Finding edges in the draft can pay off immensely during the regular season and into the playoffs.\nIdentifying mid- to late-round value picks isn't easy. Every new season provides a fresh batch of potential sleeper picks that could take your season from avoiding a last-place punishment to contending for championship glory.\nLast year saw a lot of value from the wide receiver position. Rookies Brian Thomas Jr., Malik Nabers and Ladd McConkey were some of the best players at their positions in fantasy football. Others, such as Terry McLaurin, saw a new quarterback or coordinator provide a boost.\nThis year could see more of that improvement thanks to environmental changes for wide receivers and other positions alike. A quarterback with a new play-caller, a running back with an improved offensive line or more touches, or a tight end with a new quarterback or system could see a big jump in production compared to what's expected.\nBut it's not just those positions where you can find sleepers. It's all over your lineup. We've chosen at least two sleepers at every position in 2025. With the exception of tight end (arguably the thinnest position in fantasy football), all of these sleeper candidates are 15th or lower at their position by average draft position (ADP) so you can truly find value outside of the first four rounds.\nTop fantasy football QB sleepers\nC.J. Stroud, Houston Texans\n- FantasyPros ADP: QB18, OVR130\nStroud struggled in Year 2 after setting high expectations from his rookie season. There's a change in play-caller with Nick Caley coming over from the Los Angeles Rams, and an influx of talent in the receiving corps with Jayden Higgins, Jaylin Noel and Christian Kirk. Even a small improvement in structure could make him a high-end QB2 -- much better than his current ADP.\nTrevor Lawrence, Jacksonville Jaguars\n- FantasyPros ADP: QB22, OVR144\nJust like Stroud, Lawrence has a new play-caller on offense with the arrival of head coach Liam Coen. He also will have some improvements on the offensive line as well as a new weapon in the passing game in Travis Hunter. Brian Thomas Jr. was a standout wideout as a rookie and this environment should see Lawrence outplay his status as a low-end QB2.\nMichael Penix Jr., Atlanta Falcons\n- FantasyPros ADP: QB24, OVR158\nPenix is a risky choice given his inexperience but that makes him an even better sleeper. If you project his three starts from last year over the entire season, he'd have finished ahead of Stroud and Matthew Stafford. He has proven weapons on offense in Drake London and Bijan Robinson and a solid offensive line. He could make this ranking look silly come December.\nTop fantasy football RB sleepers\nKenneth Walker III, Seattle Seahawks\n- FantasyPros ADP: RB17, OVR44\nWalker III has struggled to stay healthy throughout his career and that's depressed his value this season. Klint Kubiak's arrival in Seattle as offensive coordinator is great news for Walker as more outside zone concepts could unlock him even more. His ADP paints him as a solid RB2. If he can stay healthy, there's a chance he's a top-10 RB by the end of the season.\nTreVeyon Henderson, New England Patriots\n- FantasyPros ADP: RB23, OVR56\nHenderson's ADP shot up recently after he took a kickoff the distance for a touchdown in the preseason opener. That kind of electric play is going to get plenty of attention from fantasy managers, and for good reason. He's the most dynamic player in the Patriots offense and that will matter for second-year quarterback Drake Maye and company. The opportunity is there for him to capitalize.\nJordan Mason, Minnesota Vikings\n- FantasyPros ADP: RB34, OVR94\nReports out of Vikings camp is that Minnesota coach Kevin O'Connell is running more of an even split in the backfield than in prior years. The Vikings gave up draft value to get Mason, showing how much they value his skillset. Minnesota's offensive line could take a step in 2025 and the team might lean on the running game as J.J. McCarthy gets his footing. That's enough opportunity for Mason to get touches alongside Aaron Jones Sr., who is entering his age-31 season.\nBraelon Allen, New York Jets\n- FantasyPros ADP: RB54, OVR154\nNew York wants to run the ball more in Year 1 under coach Aaron Glenn and offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand. The offensive line should be better than in 2024 and already looks in training camp to be better in run blocking than pass blocking situations. Allen's had a solid share of the touches out of the backfield with Breece Hall, and the team appears heading to a committee approach this season.\nTop fantasy football WR sleepers\nMarvin Harrison Jr., Arizona Cardinals\n- FantasyPros ADP: WR19, OVR43\nHarrison was one of the most anticipated rookie wide receivers in years last season. If not for fellow draftees Brian Thomas Jr., Ladd McConkey and Malik Nabers shining in Year 1, we likely would have a rosier view of Harrison's first season. He's a prime post-hype sleeper candidate; the production and high hopes for the son of a Hall of Famer could bear out with another offseason to develop.\nCalvin Ridley, Tennessee Titans\n- FantasyPros ADP: WR30, OVR72\nTennessee's quarterback situation is one of the most improved league-wide from 2024. No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward will almost certainly be a better starter than Will Levis and that'll be to Ridley's benefit. Free-agent additions Tyler Lockett and Van Jefferson aren't game-changers, but they should open things up for Ridley to produce better than he did a year ago.\nRicky Pearsall, San Francisco 49ers\n- FantasyPros ADP: WR44, OVR96\nPearsall's late-season production in 2024 might be a sign of things to come. He and quarterback Brock Purdy have established a great connection in training camp and the opportunity is there for the second-year wideout to produce. Brandon Aiyuk likely will miss the first month of the season and Jauan Jennings is in the midst of a contract dispute. Pearsall could make the most of it and far outplay his low-end WR4 status in drafts.\nKeon Coleman, Buffalo Bills\n- FantasyPros ADP: WR51, OVR133\nColeman's been candid about his struggles as a rookie and what he needs to improve going into Year 2. Luckily, he has one of the best quarterbacks in the league to throw him the ball and a well-established wideout alongside in Khalil Shakir. Coleman might have a capped ceiling given Shakir's presence and the Bills' potent running game but there's every chance he could take a step in Year 2 and be much more than a WR5.\nTop fantasy football TE sleepers\nTucker Kraft, Green Bay Packers\n- FantasyPros ADP: TE10, OVR104\nKraft finished as TE8 in half-PPR leagues last season on just 50 receptions, the second-fewest of any tight end in the top 15. Only Kyle Pitts (47, TE15) had fewer. There are a lot of mouths to feed in the Packers offense, but that didn't faze Kraft last season. First-round pick Matthew Golden's arrival shouldn't impact him as much as it will the other wide receivers.\nBrenton Strange, Jacksonville Jaguars\n- FantasyPros ADP: TE22, OVR187\nStrange is a deep sleeper but could pay off. Like we said about Lawrence, Coen's arrival should facilitate the Jaguars offense taking at least a small step forward in 2025. With Christian Kirk and Evan Engram out of the building, it's unclear who will be the No. 2 target in the Jaguars passing game. Strange could take advantage; Coen made Cade Otton the top target in Tampa Bay for some stretches last season.\nTop fantasy football K sleepers\nTyler Loop, Baltimore Ravens\n- FantasyPros ADP: K15, OVR276\nThis one is pretty straightforward. The Ravens had a top-three scoring offense in 2024 and keep their coordinator and MVP runner-up quarterback as well as most of the starting players. There's little reason to think they'll slow down. They're playing a first-place schedule against many of the top powers in both conferences so they'll need all of the points they can get. It's a bit risky going with a rookie kicker but Loop could pay off.\nDaniel Carlson, Las Vegas Raiders\n- FantasyPros ADP: K18, OVR313\nCarlson finished as K10 in leagues last season and that was with the 29th-ranked scoring offense. Las Vegas invested heavily in offense this offseason and will have a huge upgrade at both quarterback and running back in 2025. This offense should be able to move the ball better throughout the season, giving Carlson more chances to score.\nTop fantasy football D/ST sleepers\nSeattle Seahawks\n- FantasyPros ADP: D/ST13, OVR249\nThe Baltimore Ravens defense took a huge step forward in 2023 to become the top unit in the league under Mike Macdonald. This season marks Macdonald's second in Seattle and the defense could take a step as well.\nSeattle very likely could end the year as a top-10 defense in both fantasy and on the field. The Seahawks face the AFC South and NFC South teams outside of their divisional matchups, and those don't feature many high-powered offenses. There might not be many flashy names in this defense but there aren't many glaring holes either. That talent group plus Macdonald's play-calling could see them vastly outperform this draft slot.\nChicago Bears\n- FantasyPros ADP: D/ST16, OVR291\nChicago brought in longtime New Orleans Saints head coach and defensive coordinator Dennis Allen to run the defense under first-year head coach Ben Johnson. Allen's defenses were always reliable in New Orleans; the Saints were a top-15 scoring defense from 2017 to 2023 with Allen at the helm. They dropped off in 2024 as he was fired mid-season.\nThe Bears play in one of the toughest divisions in football, but both the Vikings and Lions have questions on offense entering 2025 due to a first-year quarterback and new coordinator, respectively. Outside of divisional games, Chicago will face the AFC North and NFC East as well as the Browns, 49ers and Raiders. It wouldn't be too much of a stretch to see the Bears finish as a top-12 D/ST with that schedule."

      "text": "Using the fantasy football Hero RB strategy to win a title in 2025\nFantasy football managers who may not have the stomach \u2013 or the self-discipline \u2013 to employ the Zero RB strategy in drafts may consider pivoting to a slightly less-extreme version: the Hero RB strategy.\nIt's a little more traditional approach to roster-building, but it does lean heavily on the same concepts that form the basis of the Zero RB method.\nBut to implement it, you first must understand it. So let's examine the difference between the two strategies and how fantasy managers can set up their draft plan to embrace the Hero RB from the start ... or adopt it on the fly.\n2025 POSITION RANKINGS: QB | RB | WR | TE | K | D/ST | Overall\nWhat is the Hero RB strategy?\nThe concept both Zero RB and Hero RB approaches share is that it's extremely difficult for running backs to stay healthy and productive over the course of a full NFL season. Because many will suffer injuries or see their workloads decrease, there is ample opportunity for other, less-heralded running backs to step into those leading roles.\nBut while the Zero RB strategy avoids paying the full draft-day price for any starting running back, the Hero version makes an exception for one star player \u2013 typically in the first round \u2013 and then avoids the position until late in the draft.\nWhy should you use the Hero RB strategy?\nThe main reason to go Hero over Zero is when the value of drafting one of the top running backs is just too high.\nFor some, having an early first-round pick is enough to take one of the consensus top three (or four) running backs on this year's board. They all figure to be major contributors both rushing and receiving, and in fantasy formats that award points for receptions, they might just be too valuable to pass up.\nThere's certainly risk in taking a Hero RB, but he can also pave the way to a league championship.\nJust remember to exercise excruciating patience before drafting another running back. And be prepared to work the waiver wire every week to find your No. 2.\nWhat is a Hero RB?\nAlthough some may define it differently, the qualities we're using here to determine who qualifies as a Hero RB are these:\n- Lead back in an above-average offense\n- Ability to dominate rushing and receiving\n- Track record of good health\nWho are the Hero RBs in 2025?\nPretty simple. But only a select few are worthy of such a high honor this season.\nThat's it. That's the list.\nSure, Ashton Jeanty of the Las Vegas Raiders has the upside to belong in that top group, but he doesn't yet have any NFL experience. Derrick Henry of the Baltimore Ravens clearly checks two of the three boxes, but he's an afterthought in the passing game. Health is a question for De'Von Achane of the Miami Dolphins and Christian McCaffrey of the San Francisco 49ers.\nMaybe you'll have an opportunity to grab one of those other top backs at a discount. If so, feel free to modify the Hero RB approach to fit your situation. Some people prefer a modified Hero RB approach by drafting a no-doubt starting running back in the first two rounds and then waiting another five or six rounds before taking another.\nJust remember, you're not following the Zero/Hero RB strategy if you're not building the foundation of your roster on safer stud receivers."
