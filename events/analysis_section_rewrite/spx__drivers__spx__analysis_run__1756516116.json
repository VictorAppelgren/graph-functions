      "feedback": "The draft is empty and fails every acceptance gate: it contains no canonical handle mapping, no causal chain, no catalysts, and no quantitative or source‑backed assertions. To meet the standard, rewrite the view to focus on a specific asset (e.g., **ust10y** or **spx**) and anchor it to a clear macro pillar (e.g., Fed policy → term‑premium shift). Include a signed, magnitude‑range forecast (e.g., “UST 10Y yields likely to rise 10–15 bp over Q4 2025 as the Fed signals a 25 bp hike in June”), a dated catalyst window (e.g., Fed’s June 12 policy meeting), and a causal transmission path (Fed rate → term‑premium → UST 10Y). Cite at least one source ID (e.g., (H86O3XRUJ) for the Fed policy stance) and quantify any implied market impact (e.g., “spx could gain 0.2–0.3 % from the 10 bp yield rise”). Ensure the paragraph is concise, uses the required naming conventions, and explicitly links every claim to a canonical handle. This will satisfy the truth‑over‑verbosity rule and provide a defensible, actionable view.",
