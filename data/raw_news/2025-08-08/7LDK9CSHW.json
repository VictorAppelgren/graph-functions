  "title": "Dallas\u2019 Scottie Scheffler in tie for seventh headed into weekend of St. Jude Championship",
  "description": "Tommy Fleetwood is atop the leaderboard at 13-under par.",
  "content": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. \u2014 Tommy Fleetwood had another big closing stretch Friday with four straight birdies, giving him a 6-under 64 and the 36-hole lead in the FedEx Cup St. Jude Championship with his sights set on an elusive PGA Tour title.\n\nSo much attention is on the top 50 in the FedEx Cup who advance out of the first postseason event. Fleetwood is already locked in all the way to the finale at the Tour Championship. What he cares about is winning.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened for me yet out on the PGA Tour, but I would much rather be up there and not quite get it done than not there at all,\u201d Fleetwood said. \u201cAnd who knows? Maybe this weekend is the weekend and we\u2019ll see, and we\u2019ll crack on from there.\u201d\n\nFleetwood was at 13-under 127, four shots clear of Collin Morikawa (65) and Akshay Bhatia (69). Justin Rose also was at 9-under par after a birdie on the par-5 16th. Storms rolled into the area, forcing spectators to leave the course and suspending play until Saturday morning.\n\nFleetwood finished with four straight birdies on Thursday. He made three in a row early, including a 30-footer from the fringe on the par-3 fourth hole at the TPC Southwind. He also had a pair of key par saves around the turn before going on another run.\n\nHe holed a pair of 15-foot birdie putts on the 13th and 14th. He stuffed a wedge to 5 feet for birdie on the 15th. And then he reached the par-5 16th in two and two-putted from about 30 feet for a fourth straight birdie.\n\nThe only bogey came at the final hole when he went from the bunker into thick rough, and the safe shot from there was some 50 feet long of the pin.\n\n\u201cOf course, when you shoot two good scores, it\u2019s easy to say everything has been going well,\u201d Fleetwood said. \u201cBut I think for the most part I\u2019ve been very good off the tee, put myself in position to have a go at the course. My iron play has been good and solid, and I\u2019ve rolled the ball well.\u201d\n\nKurt Kitayama had the low score of the round at 63, moving him to the top five on the leaderboard as a reminder of how quickly fortunes can change.\n\nThe FedEx Cup playoffs were an afterthought until two weeks ago. He was at No. 110 until winning the 3M Open in Minnesota. Now he\u2019s at No. 52 and the next goal is to move on to the BMW Championship next week outside Baltimore.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to pay attention to the top 50 this week because along with advancing in the postseason, anyone in the top 50 is assured of being in all eight of the $20 million signature events next year.\n\n\u201cI feel like everyone is for the most part,\u201d Kitayama said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t control what everyone else is doing. If you play well, it\u2019s going to take care of itself. That\u2019s kind of my mindset. But yeah, I\u2019m peeking over quite a bit at the scoreboard.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no need for Scottie Scheffler to look. The PGA and British Open champion is so far ahead in the FedEx Cup he is assured of staying at the top this week. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s cruising along without a care.\n\nScheffler was slowed by three bogeys on the back nine, landing in rough that swallowed up his golf ball and left him visibly frustrated. He still shot a 66 and was six shots behind.\n\nJordan Spieth had an 8-foot par putt on the final hole that turned toward the cup and looked to be falling from gravity alone when it hung on the edge. That about summed up his day of three bogeys, three birdies and a 70 that left him 12 shots behind and facing plenty of stress for the weekend as he tries to avoid a second straight year outside the top 50.\n\nTexas Tech\u2019s Ludvig Aberg is at 6-under par and TCU\u2019s Tom Hoge is at 7-over par.\n\nBud Cauley, one spot behind Kitayama in the FedEx Cup at No. 53, shot 69 and was in a tie for seventh when play was suspended.\n\nOnce the second round is completed, the third round will follow in threesomes off both sides.\n\nFleetwood is No. 15 in the world with seven wins on the European tour against some of the stronger fields. He has thrived on a big stage overseas, particularly the Ryder Cup. It\u2019s just that small matter of a PGA Tour title.\n\nHe was on the verge in late June at the Travelers Championship until a stunning flip at the end, when he took three putts from just short of the green for bogey and Keegan Bradley made birdie to beat him.\n\n\u201cRight now I would love to just go and sulk somewhere and maybe I will do,\u201d he said that Sunday at the Travelers. \u201cBut there\u2019s just no point making it a negative for the future really, just take the positives and move on.\u201d\n\nHe gets another chance on the weekend at the TPC Southwind, still only the halfway point but at least there with a chance and in command of his game from tee-to-green.\n\nFind more golf coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.",

      "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Akshay Bhatia had a blazing finish to get his PGA Tour postseason off to a good start, closing eagle-birdie-birdie for an 8-under 62 to post his career low and take a one-shot lead over Tommy Fleetwood in the FedEx St. Jude Championship.\nScottie Scheffler, playing for the first time since winning the British Open for his second major of the year, made bogey on the final hole for a 67, his 10th straight round in the 60s.\nBhatia comes into the FedEx Cup playoffs at No. 45, with only the top 50 advancing to the second of three tournaments in the lucrative postseason. The idea is to be among the top 30 who reach East Lake for a shot at the $10 million bonus.\nHe was paired with Harry Hall of England, who is at No. 44. Hall was matching Bhatia until the final two holes, when Bhatia rolled in a 25-foot birdie putt on the 17th and stuffed a short iron into 2 feet on 18.\nBhatia said he has been spending too much time thinking about numbers, whether it\u2019s his score or his world ranking or his position in the FedEx Cup. The goal is to keep his mind peaceful.\n\u201cI felt pretty relaxed, and I\u2019m just not trying to force anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to get mad at golf shots but not at yourself.\u201d\nJustin Rose and Bud Cauley, who is at No. 53, also were at 64 on a TPC Southwind that has 18 new greens and a course with much thicker rough.\nFleetwood is all but set for the FedEx Cup finale at No. 9, though he would love to get that first PGA Tour title to go along with European tour wins against strong fields. He hit 13 out of 14 fairways, and the one he missed led to a birdie when he holed a bunker shot on No. 9.\n\u201cPeople talk about this golf course as a second-shot golf course, but it\u2019s only a second-shot golf course if you\u2019re in the fairway,\u201d Fleetwood said. \u201cI hit the ball so well off the tee that I was always giving myself an opportunity.\u201d\nAnd then it helped to see the putts drop, four straight birdies to close out his round.\nFleetwood has the right outlook for this postseason series. Asked if he looked at the three weeks as one big event or each tournament on its own, Fleetwood said, \u201cIt really day to day.\u201d\nProjections can fluctuate with shots from anyone on any part of the course. Rickie Fowler, who missed the top 70 who qualify for the postseason last year, came in at No. 64 and shot 66, which projects him inside the top 50.\nJordan Spieth was at No. 48. He had to rally on the back nine for a 69 that put him out of the top 50, and then back to No. 50 by the end of the day.\nScheffler is assured the No. 1 seed for at least another week. He looked plenty sharp, giving himself a lot of looks at birdie and converting four of them. He missed out on a good birdie chance at the par-5 16th when he drove into the rough and sent the next shot into a bunker about 100 yards short of the green. He also took three putts from 70 feet on the final hole.\n\u201cToday was a good day. I did some solid stuff,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cFelt like I was close to playing a really great round but ended up with a solid round. Overall a decent start.\u201d\nThis is one of the more important weeks of the PGA Tour because of what\u2019s at stake. Not only do the top 50 advance to the BMW Championship, they are assured of being in all the $20 million signature events for next year.\nAmong those on the bubble, Dallas resident Si Woo Kim (No. 46) opened with a 65 and former U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark had a 67.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like dicey spot right now,\u201d Kim said. \u201cAnd started struggling, so I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can get through to next week.\u2019 But tried to keep it as simple as possible, and that helps me a lot. I had a great round, so hopefully I\u2019ve got more room the next couple days. Just trying to make it simple and not much think about next week.\u201d\nRyder Cup captain Keegan Bradley, who might be the first playing captain since 1963, opened with a 72. Bradley is No. 10 in the Ryder Cup standings. He played with Maverick McNealy, who is 11th in the standings. McNealy shot 66."

      "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. \u2014 Scottie Scheffler returned home from his British Open victory, made a few brief appearances in New York and used the claret jug to get 15-month-old son Bennett into the men\u2019s grill at Royal Oaks in Dallas.\nHe is rested. The key for Scheffler, regardless of the tournament, is to be ready. But this is the time of the year, even with $15 million at stake, not to be grinding on the range.\n\u201cAt this point in the year, that extra practice is maybe only going to be draining for me a little bit, and that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve learned to manage as my career has gone on,\u201d Scheffler said Wednesday after his pro-am round in the FedEx St. Jude Championship.\nThe tournament at TPC Southwind is the start of three straight FedEx Cup playoff events that culminate with the FedEx Cup title to whoever wins the Tour Championship.\nIn a revamped postseason, the $25 million to the winner has been split up into three parts. Scheffler already picked up $10 million for leading the FedEx Cup in the regular season (along with $8 million from the Comcast Business Top 10 bonus program).\nThe FedEx Cup leader after the BMW Championship next week gets $5 million, and the winner of the Tour Championship \u2014 all 30 players start from scratch this time \u2014 gets $10 million.\nThe TPC Southwind is where Scheffler last missed a cut in 2022 (when the postseason was for the top 125 players, not the top 70). This year he comes to the postseason off a double major season \u2014 the PGA Championship and the British Open \u2014 and has finished in the top 10 in his last 11 tournaments dating to March.\nIt\u2019s safe to say his game is in reasonably good shape. Now it\u2019s about conserving energy for August stops in Memphis, Baltimore and Atlanta.\n\u201cI would say my prep week last week definitely looked a bit different than it would have looked before the Scottish Open (in July) and definitely looked a little bit different than it would have looked if you go back to the beginning of the year when I was coming off injury,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo making sure I\u2019m rested, ready to play,\u201d he said. \u201cMy game is in a good spot, and I feel like some extra practice at this point in the year can almost be detrimental in terms of just physical and mental fatigue.\u201d\nScheffler stopped in New York for a brief appearance on the Jimmy Fallon Show and to attend the Happy Gilmore 2 premiere. A lot of time included that silver claret jug he picked up from a dominant victory at Royal Portrush.\n\u201cWe had a party two weeks ago at home with some of our friends, and everybody got to drink out of it. It was a lot of fun,\u201d Scheffler said.\nHe also has brought golf\u2019s oldest trophy to his home course at Royal Oaks \u2014 Justin Leonard brought the claret jug to the course when he won the Open in 1997 \u2014 and there was one time he went with just his son.\n\u201cHe whacked some golf balls around, and we hung out for a bit,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI took him to the 19th hole with me, and I got some pretty funny pictures with Bennett sitting in the 19th hole at the men\u2019s only grill where you\u2019ve got to be \u2014 I think you\u2019ve got to be 19 to get in there, but I figured if we bring in a couple major championship trophies with us, they\u2019ll let the rules slide on that one.\u201d\nAnd now it\u2019s back to work. The points are quadrupled for the postseason, but Scheffler has such a lead \u2014 and Rory McIlroy is sitting this one out \u2014 that he is assured of staying at No. 1.\nThis is one of the most important tournaments of the year because the top 50 after this week not only advance to the BMW Championship, they are assured of getting in all the $20 million signature events next year.\nAmong those on the bubble for that is Jordan Spieth at No. 48, who is also trying to keep his shrinking Ryder Cup hopes alive."
