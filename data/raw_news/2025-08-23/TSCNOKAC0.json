  "title": "Bill Maher applauds Gavin Newsom for mocking Donald Trump: 'I think it's very funny'",
  "description": "\"Real Time\" host Bill Maher is praising California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, for his shady X posts aimed at President Donald Trump.",
  "content": "During an Aug. 22 episode of his HBO show \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" the late-night host referenced the governor's X posts aimed at Trump, proclaiming to his panel, \"I've never seen a Democrat do this, I think it's very funny.\"\n\nMaher, 69, added: \"I feel like Gavin has grasped the essential thing about American culture in this day and age. Don't try to outsmart people. You have to out-stupid them.\"\n\nThe 57-year-old Newsom \u2013 long floated as a possible frontrunner for the Democrats' 2028 nomination for president \u2013 is throwing out his party's playbook in favor of a more aggressive style of politics, embracing Trump's own approach.\n\n\"This is a new Democratic Party. This is a new energy out there all across this country, and we are going to meet fire with fire,\" Newsom said in response to USA TODAY during an Aug. 20 conference call with party leaders.\n\nNewsom said that he's attempting to activate \"a renewed sense of purpose\" among potential voters.\n\n\"And I say that as a guy not from a small, isolated state but (one) the size of 21 state populations combined that is the fourth largest economy in the world,\" Newsom said. \"We are going to meet this moment head-on.\" The tone of Newsom's posts reflect Trump's approach to dealing with adversaries online.\n\n\"WOW! FOX NEWS CAN\u2019T STOP TALKING ABOUT ME (GAVIN C. NEWSOM), AMERICA\u2019S FAVORITE GOVERNOR!!! TONIGHT THEIR ENTIRE PRIMETIME LINEUP WAS ABOUT ME! JESSE WATTERS KEPT CALLING ME 'DADDY' (VERY WEIRD, NOT INTERESTED, BUT THANK YOU!),\" an Aug. 20 post from the governor's press office said.\n\nAn Aug. 21 post dove into the fiery conservative uproar about Cracker Barrel's new logo, saying the restaurant chain should: \"KEEP YOUR BEAUTIFUL LOGO!!! THE NEW ONE LOOKS LIKE CHEAP VELVEETA 'CHEESE' FROM WALMART, THE PLACE FOR 'GROCERIES' (AN OLD FASHIONED TERM)!!! 'FIX IT' ASAP! WOKE IS DEAD!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. \u2014 GCN.\"\n\nTrump has noticed, slamming Newsom for his antics. \"I know Gavin very well,\" the president told reporters during an Aug. 22 event in the Oval Office. \"He's an incompetent guy with a good line of (bull).\"\n\nEarlier this year, Maher revealed that he got to know Trump well, recounting a dinner he had with the president at the White House during an April 11 episode of \"Real Time.\" Despite bringing a \"list of almost 60 different insulting epithets that the president said about me\" and having Trump sign it, the pair got along well.\n\n\"As you know, 12 days ago, I had dinner with President Trump \u2013 a dinner that was set up by my friend Kid Rock, because we share a belief that there's got to be something better than hurling insults from 3,000 miles away,\" Maher said. He then went on to document the meeting as rather pleasant despite their past beef.\n\n\"The guy I met is not the person who the night before the dinner \u2026 tweeted a bunch of nasty crap about how he thought this dinner was a bad idea and what a deranged (expletive) I was,\" Maher said on-air. \"I read it and thought, oh, what a lovely way to welcome someone to your house.\"\n\nHe added: \"But when I got there, that guy wasn't living there.\"",

      "text": "Kid Rock allegedly waved gun at reporter, used racial slur during Rolling Stone interview\nKid Rock is no stranger to controversy, but the singer is now making headlines for his lack of decorum in an explosive interview with Rolling Stone magazine.\nRock, born Robert James Ritchie, was interviewed by reporter David Peisner for the wide-ranging profile, which was published online late Sunday.\nFollowing a conversation that spanned political topics such as transgender rights and the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Peisner alleges the \u201cPicture\u201d singer took out a weapon during their exchange. The reporter also notes that Rock had been drinking three to four alcoholic beverages in \u201cpretty quick succession\u201d leading up to the incident.\n\u201cHe\u2019s sitting in a dark leather chair, shouting at me about something or other, when he reaches behind the seat, pulls out a black handgun, and waves it around to make some sort of point,\u201d Peisner writes, adding that Rock shouted, \u201cAnd I got a (expletive) gun right here if I need it! I got them everywhere!\u201d\nPeisner also alleges in the article that Rock uttered a racial slur several times throughout the interview.\nUSA TODAY has reached out to a representative for Rock for comment.\nKid Rock utters racial slur repeatedly in Rolling Stone interview\nRock, who has become increasingly known for his political outspokenness, defended his support of former president and 2024 Republican candidate Donald Trump in his interview with Rolling Stone.\nWhen asked by Peisner if he \u201cmight be on the wrong side of history\u201d due to his political stance, Rock reveals that Detroit rapper Trick Trick, who is Black, allegedly voiced his support of Rock\u2019s allegiance to Trump. The country-rock singer also calls Trick Trick a racial slur in his description of their conversation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth mentioning these are not the only times Ritchie drops\" the offensive term during the interview, Peisner writes. \u201cIt\u2019d be easy to label this as the rantings of a drunk racist, but as with everything that Ritchie does, it\u2019s hard to know how calculated it all is.\n\u201cIs he just trying to get a reaction? Is he begging to be pilloried when this story comes out so he can launch into a very public tirade against 'cancel culture'? Is this all just a play for more attention?\u201d\nKid Rock talks to Tucker Carlson: 'You can't cancel me, I love it when they try'\nKid Rock says he\u2019s \u2018part of the problem\u2019 when it comes to political discourse\nWhile reflecting on his performance in \u201cAmericans,\u201d a 2012 short film about political differences co-starring Sean Penn, Rock suggested to Rolling Stone that he has contributed to the contentious sociopolitical climate in the U.S.\nRock has famously used his music to express his right-wing views, including the 2022 single \u201cWe the People,\u201d a fiery political anthem littered with criticisms of President Joe Biden, mainstream media outlets CNN and TMZ, social media platforms Facebook and X and the Black Lives Matter movement.\nFrom 'Bawitdaba' to 'Let's Go Brandon': Kid Rock's history of hits and political controversy\n\u201cI\u2019m part of the problem,\u201d Rock told Peisner. \u201cI\u2019m one of the polarizing people, no question.\"\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get it right every time, but I know my heart\u2019s right. I want the best for this country.\u201d\nContributing: USA TODAY staff report"

      "text": "Bill Maher calls himself 'a hero' for speaking 'truth to power' during Trump meeting\nBill Maher has some words for those who didn't like what he had to say about his White House dinner with Pres. Donald Trump.\nTMZ founder Harvey Levin invited his \"dear friend\" Maher on the 2 Angry Men podcast, which Levin hosts with criminal defense attorney Mark Geragos, for the April 17 episode. The three opened the show by asking the \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" host for his thoughts on criticism he's received \u2013 including from Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin, who'd said on \"Real Time\" that Trump was using Maher as \"a prop in a PR stunt.\"\n\"I would say to them, as opposed to what? I had the opportunity to go to the White House and talk to the president and not give up my principles. It seems like nobody noticed that,\" Maher told Levin and Geragos. \"I didn't go MAGA. I had the opportunity to talk to Donald Trump and say things to him that maybe he never hears, literally to speak truth to power. I shouldn't take that opportunity? Again, don't do that? OK.\"\nBill Maher says he should be considered a 'hero' for going 'inside the inner sanctum' of Trump\nMaher, a longtime Trump critic, later doubled down on defending the meeting, saying, \"I'm not the villain here.\"\n\"I should be a hero for being one of the people who got inside the inner sanctum and was able to say to this person \u2013 who knows how much he ever hears anything that's not coming from the cult? \u2013 and say those things and stick to my guns,\" Maher said.\nTrump has gone after Maher multiple times over the years, frequently targeting him in social media posts that claimed the ratings for \"Real Time,\" now in its 23rd season, were suffering. Trump also filed a lawsuit against Maher in 2013 \u2014 then later dropped the case \u2014 after the TV host joked that Trump was \"the spawn of his mother having sex with an orangutan.\"\nHowever, Maher also insisted he was one of Trump's earliest political critics and maintained that \"A lot of the things he's doing are just crazy. Threatening to send home-grown Americans to foreign prisons is just outrageous. ... The cutting off of the aid to the people who are starving and dying of diseases around the world.\"\nWhat did Bill Maher say about his Trump meeting?\nIn the April 11 episode of \"Real Time,\" Maher opened the show with a 13-minute monologue detailing his meeting with Trump and Kid Rock, who'd coordinated the visit, as well as UFC CEO Dana White.\nIn his monologue, Maher conceded Trump is \"much more self-aware than he lets on in public\" but acknowledged, \"It doesn't matter who he is at a private dinner with a comedian; it matters who he is on the world stage.\" He later added, \"Why can't we get the guy I met to be the public guy?\"\nThough the March 31 meeting went well, Maher \u2013 who had derided the president's tariff flip-flopping earlier in the monologue \u2013 maintained he will continue to hold the Trump administration to account.\n\"He ended his report by saying, \"Trump was gracious and measured, and why he isn't that in other settings, I don't know. And I can't answer, and it's not my place to answer. I'm just telling you what I saw.\""

      "text": "Bill Maher's full monologue on his Donald Trump meeting: Read the transcript\nIn the opening monologue for the April 11 episode of \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" Maher gave a highly anticipated report on how his dinner with Pres. Donald Trump at the White House went.\n\"What I'm gonna do is report exactly what happened. You decide what you think about it,\" the longtime host told his audience.\nMaher conceded the Trump he met on March 31 was different from the persona he sees on TV. But he also acknowledged, \"It doesn't matter who he is at a private dinner with a comedian; it matters who he is on the world stage.\"\nHe later added, \"Why can't we get the guy I met to be the public guy?\"\nThough the meeting, which was also attended by Kid Rock and UFC CEO Dana White, went well, Maher maintained he will continue to hold the Trump administration to account in his political commentary.\nRead on for a transcript of Maher's monologue.\nWatch Bill Maher's full monologue about his Trump meeting\nBill Maher discusses dinner with Donald Trump: full transcript\nFor what I know you\u2019ve all been waiting for, I\u2019d like to give you my book report on my visit to the White House. As you know, 12 days ago, I had dinner with President Trump \u2014 a dinner that was set up by my friend Kid Rock, because we share a belief that there's got to be something better than hurling insults from 3,000 miles away.\nAnd let me first say that to all the people who treated this like it was some kind of summit meeting, you are ridiculous. Like I was going to sign a treaty or something. I have no power. I'm a \u2026 comedian and he's the most powerful leader in the world. I'm not the leader of anything, except maybe a contingent of centrist-minded people who think there's got to be a better way of running this country than hating each other every minute.\nOK, so meet up in person, maybe it'll be different. Spoiler alert, it was. First good sign, before I left for the capital, I had my staff collect and print out this list of almost 60 different insulting epithets that the president said about me. Things like: stupid, dummy, low-life dummy, sleazebag, sick, sad, stone-cold crazy. Really a dumb guy, fired like a dog, his show is dead.\nI brought this to the White House because I wanted him to sign it, which he did. Which he did, with good humor, and I know as I say that, millions of liberal sphincters just tightened. Oh my god, Bill, are you gonna say something nice about him? What I'm gonna do is report exactly what happened. You decide what you think about it. And if that's not enough pure Trump hate for you, I don't give a (expletive).\nSo no, I didn't go MAGA. And to the president's credit, there was no pressure to. After we left the Oval Office, he showed me the little room off the office, you know, the one where Clinton used to ... the (expletive) room, OK? Well, not anymore. That's where they keep the merch now.\nAnd he gave me a bunch of hats, but he didn\u2019t ask me to take a picture in one, which I appreciated. The guy I met is not the person who the night before the dinner \u2026 tweeted a bunch of nasty crap about how he thought this dinner was a bad idea and what a deranged (expletive) I was. I read it and thought, oh, what a lovely way to welcome someone to your house.\nBut when I got there, that guy wasn't living there. Now, does Trump want respect? Of course, who doesn't? My friend said to me, what are you going to wear to the White House? I said, I don't know, but I'm not going to dress like Zelenskyy, I'll tell you that. Just for starters, he laughs! I've never seen him laugh in public. But he does, including at himself. And it's not fake. Believe me, as a comedian of 40 years, I know a fake laugh when I hear it. And I thank you for them.\nExample: In the Oval Office he was showing me the portraits of presidents and he pointed to Reagan and said in all seriousness, \u2018You know the best thing about him? His hair.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, there was also that whole bringing down Communism thing.\u2019 (I was) waiting for the button next to the Diet Coke button to get pushed and I go through the trap door. But no, he laughed; he got it.\nI said to him at one point, \u2018Mr. President, you know, the dog. That's unusual in the White House.\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, a lot of the presidents, they had a dog for political reasons.\u2019 I said, \u2018No, people love dogs! That's what that is.\u2019 (Trump said) \u2018Oh yeah, OK, that true.\u2019 I\u2019m telling you, it happened!\nAt one point we were walking through his amazing \u2014 it is an amazing tour of the whole house. And I don't remember exactly what we were talking about but it must have been something with the 2020 election because I know he used the word \u2018lost\u2019, and I distinctly remember saying, \u2018Wow, I never thought I'd hear you say that.\u2019 He didn't get mad. He\u2019s much more self-aware than he lets on in public.\nLook, I get it. It doesn't matter who he is at a private dinner with a comedian; it matters who he is on the world stage. I'm just taking it as a positive that this person exists, because everything I've ever not liked about him was, I swear to God, absent, at least on this night with this guy. Bob \u2014 Kid Rock \u2014told me the night before, he said, \u2018If you want to get a word in edgewise, you're going to have to cut him off, (or) he'll just go on.\u2019 Not at all.\nI've had so many conversations with prominent people who are much less connected, people who don't look you in the eye, people who really don't listen because they just want to get to their next thing, people whose response to things you say just doesn't track. Like, what? None of that with him. And he mostly steered the conversations: \u2018So what do you think about this?\u2019 I know. Your mind is blown. So is mine.\nThere were so many moments when I hit him with a joke or contradicted something and no problem. At dinner, he was asking me about the nuclear situation in Iran in a very genuine, \u2018Hey, I think you're a smart guy. I want your opinion\u2019 sort of way. And I said, \u2018Well, obviously you're privy to things about it (that) I'm not, but for what it's worth, I thought the Obama deal was worth letting play out because we made Iran destroy 98% of the uranium, and they were 15 years away from a bomb.\u2019\nAnd then I said to him, \u2018Well, we got rid of that. You got rid of that.\u2019 He didn't get mad or call me a left-wing lunatic. He took it in. I told him I thought parts of his plan for Gaza were wacky but that I had supported him in the idea that Gaza could be Dubai instead of hell. I told him he was wrong when he tweeted the night before that I was critical of all things Trump. Not true \u2014 check the tapes.\nMoving Israel's embassy to Jerusalem? Loved it. The border did need to be controlled. I'm glad the cops are getting their morale back. DEI had gone too far. Biological men shouldn't be playing women's sports. Europe should pay for their defense. And of course, it makes sense that Arab countries should take in Arab refugees, like the million Syrians who wound up in Germany when Saudi Arabia took none. He said to me, \u2018You're right, they took none.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well you should remind your boyfriend in Saudi Arabia that the next time you see him.\u2019 He laughed.\nI never felt I had to walk on eggshells around him, and honestly? I voted for Clinton and Obama but I would never feel comfortable talking to them the way I was able to talk with Donald Trump. That's just how it went down. Make of it what you will. Me? I feel it's emblematic of why the Democrats are so unpopular these days. He was even OK when I checked him on the orangutan lawsuit. He was. I know.\nHe said to Dana White, you know, \u2018Bill said my father was an orangutan, and I said, I really love my father.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, Mr. President, I did that because I didn't like what you were doing regarding Obama's birth origins. I thought that was low.\u2019 Again, no anger, just a little smile, as if to say, yeah, I get it.\nThe most surreal part of the whole night was when I got home. I flew back right after the dinner, and I'm in bed watching \u201960 Minutes\u2019 from the night before. And there's Trump in one of their stories, standing at a podium in a room that looked to me like one of the rooms and places we'd just been in. And he's ranting, \u2018Disgusting, you're a terrible person.\u2019 And I'm like, who's that guy? What happened to Glinda the Good Witch? And why can't we get the guy I met to be the public guy?\nAnd I'm not saying it's our responsibility to do that. It's not. I'm just reporting exactly what I saw over two and a half hours. I went into the mine, and that's what's down there. A crazy person doesn't live in the White House. A person who plays a crazy person on TV a lot lives there, which I know is (expletive) up. It's just not as (expletive) up as I thought it was. And I have no illusions now that I'm back to work at my job that he might start a new list.\nBecause I don't have a good feeling and will be critical about a lot of what he's doing: the trade war and disappearing people, ruling by decree, threatening judges, gutting the government with glee. But I also think he now understands I have a job to do, or at least he did on this night because he said to me early on that he'd seen our last episode, which was the Friday before this dinner And he said, \u2018I thought maybe you'd be nice, but you'd hit me really hard.\u2019 I did, because I'm not going to pull my punches that presidents get to propose a third term for themselves. He understood that, and without animus. That doesn't mean he's not going try to do it.\nAt one point I said to him, \u2018You're scaring people. Do you really want to be scaring your own citizens so much?\u2019 And I know now you're all saying, and what did he say to that? Honestly, I don't remember. But it wasn't \u2018OK, I'll stop.\u2019\nSo MAGA fans, don't worry, your boy gave me nothing. Just hats. Hats and a very generous amount of time and a willingness to listen and accept me as a possible friend, even though I'm not MAGA, which was the point of the dinner. My favorite part of the whole night was we were standing in the (room off the Oval Office) and he said, \u2018You know I've heard from a lot of people who really like that we're having this dinner. Not all, but a lot.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Same, a lot of people told me they loved it, but not all.\u2019\nAnd we agreed the people who don't even want us to talk? We don't like you. Don't talk as opposed to what? Writing the same editorial for the millionth time and making 25-hour speeches into the wind. Really, that's what liberals have? He takes the piss out of everybody else, and we can hold ours?\nOK, that's my report. You can hate me for it, but I'm not a liar. Trump was gracious and measured, and why he isn't that in other settings, I don't know. And I can't answer, and it's not my place to answer. I'm just telling you what I saw, and I wasn't high.\nDamn, missed opportunity."

      "text": "'Don't poke the bear:' Newsom uses Trump\u2019s punchy-style to make 2028 case\nCalifornia's governor is raking in cash and skyrocketing to the top of the polls for his eye-for-an-eye approach as he imitates Trump's online rants.\nNine months after a California liberal failed to keep Donald Trump and the MAGA movement from retaking Washington, another Golden State Democrat has snatched the national microphone with an aggressive delivery.\n\"This is a new Democratic Party. This is a new energy out there all across this country, and we are going to meet fire with fire,\" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in response to USA TODAY during an Aug. 20 conference call with party leaders.\nIf Democrats are still having a crisis in confidence because of tanking popularity in the polls and bleeding voter registration numbers across the country, someone hasn't told the 57-year-old Newsom, who, between the flashy AI-generated memes and all caps social media rants has given the party an adrenaline rush this summer.\nAsked whether the page has turned on Democrats working with the Trump administration, Newsom said he still reveres the office of president, but that he\u2019s trying to inject the party with a sense of urgency and activate \"a renewed sense of purpose\" among citizens.\n\"And I say that as a guy not from a small, isolated state but (one) the size of 21 state populations combined that is the fourth largest economy in the world,\" Newsom said. \"We are going to meet this moment head-on.\"\nIt's an effective game plan in an attention-economy media landscape, some Democrats say, and it is being fueled by major clashes with Trump that are catching the attention of party naysayers.\n\"Gavin Newsom has been doing what I've wanted a Democrat to do for a long time,\" hip-hop radio host Charlamagne tha God said in an episode of \"The Breakfast Club\" earlier this month.\n\"When they low go, either you ignore them or you go to hell. He's matching energy and I like it.\"\nOne day after the Republican-controlled state House in Texas passed new redistricting plans at the president\u2019s behest, Newsom led the Democratic-run California legislature to approve a similar map for his state's voters to decide on in a Nov.4 special election.\nAmong the speculative field of 2028 White House contenders, Newsom has emerged as a Generation X liberal brawler who repurposes some of the same online gimmicks of the MAGA movement\u2019s figurehead, skyrocketing him to the top of the polls in the too-soon-to-think-about next Democratic presidential primary.\nTrump, too, has noticed. \"I know Gavin very well,\" the president told reporters during an Aug. 22 event in the Oval Office. \"He\u2019s an incompetent guy with a good line of bull----.\u201d\nOther Dems praise Newsom's aggressive approach\nLiberals have castigated some potential 2028 candidates, including Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, for appearing too cozy with Trump. Others are also carving out a more conciliatory tone with Trump voters. By contrast, Newsom has leaned into being a strident and unapologetic anti-Trump voice.\nThe term-limited California governor has reportedly raked in $6.2 million in online donations in one week amid the redistricting battle and he's received rave reviews from some skeptical Democrats.\nThis might be the type of energy Democrats desperately need to stop the bleeding after months of polling showing their party in the gutter with voters. A new analysis by the New York Times this week found the GOP gaining 4.5 million registered voters nationwide compared with Democrats.\nAs Republicans moved to have state legislatures under their umbrella of control add more favorable seats to the 2026 midterm maps in Texas, Ohio and Indiana, Newsom matched the bare-knuckle approach with a new version of California's congressional maps that would eliminate five GOP-leaning seats.\nThe confrontational counterattack on redrawing the boundaries that make up who represents Americans in Congress has led to other blue-state governors in Illinois, New York and Maryland to mull similar steps. It's a position being endorsed by party leaders, such as DNC Chairman Ken Martin, and usually prudent figures, too, such as former President Barack Obama, who said on Aug. 20 he had \"tremendous respect\" for Newsom's approach despite his previous opposition to \"political gerrymandering\" overall.\n\"I think that (Gavin Newsom) is doing the exact right thing in California, if these are the new rules everybody's got to play by them,\" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, another 2028 aspirant who has visited early primary states, said on Aug. 21 during his podcast.\nThe redistricting is becoming a wedge issue that progressives want to battle out, but some warn Newsom is playing a \"dangerous game\" with redistricting, given that the uphill battle could backfire on Democrats. They are hamstrung by having fewer states in their control and stricter rules that make partisan redrawing more difficult.\nBrian Sobel, a longtime political analyst based in the San Francisco Bay Area, said Newsom will earn the ire of red-state voters for his move. But Sobel also argued that the governor may be calculating that redrawing congressional maps won't be the hot button topic it is now by next year.\nIn the meantime, Sobel said, fighting so fiercely for the issue now creates an aura around the governor that gives him a national footprint.\n\"And that's exactly what Gavin Newsom wants and that's exactly where he is at presently,\" he said.\nMimicking Trump's social media rants to the top of 2028 polls\nWhen the CEO of Bed Bath & Beyond said the company was bailing on California due to the state's strict regulations, for instance, Newsom didn't dive into a policy wonk defense of his government\u2019s policies.\nInstead, he clapped back with a dismissive brashness.\n\"The company that already went bankrupt and closed every store across the country two years ago? Ok,\" Newsom said in an Aug. 20 post on X responding to the company's chief executive.\nNewsom has also been relishing the role of egging on conservative politicians, commentators and celebrities by mimicking the president's all-caps social media rants.\n\"WOW! FOX NEWS CAN\u2019T STOP TALKING ABOUT ME (GAVIN C. NEWSOM), AMERICA\u2019S FAVORITE GOVERNOR!!! TONIGHT THEIR ENTIRE PRIMETIME LINEUP WAS ABOUT ME! JESSE WATTERS KEPT CALLING ME 'DADDY' (VERY WEIRD, NOT INTERESTED, BUT THANK YOU!),\" an Aug. 20 post from the governor's press office said.\nAn Aug. 21 post dove into the fiery conservative uproar about Cracker Barrel's new logo, saying the restaurant chain should: \"KEEP YOUR BEAUTIFUL LOGO!!! THE NEW ONE LOOKS LIKE CHEAP VELVEETA 'CHEESE' FROM WALMART, THE PLACE FOR 'GROCERIES' (AN OLD FASHIONED TERM)!!! 'FIX IT' ASAP! WOKE IS DEAD!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. \u2014 GCN.\"\nThe governor\u2019s communications team has also begun using AI-generated images, which are a favorite of right-leaning activists to slam liberal causes and officials.\nOne message by Newsom\u2019s press office on X, for instance, featured an AI-generated image of musician Kid Rock, a well-known Trump ally, dressed as Uncle Sam, pointing at the user: \u201cKid Rock Wants You to Support Gavin Newsom.\u201d\nThe singer and rapper lashed out in an Aug. 18 post, saying the only support Newsom would ever get from him would be \u201cdeez nuts,\u201d a colloquial reference to his anatomy.\nOther conservatives have taken shots at Newsom's newfound online voice, such as Vice President JD Vance, MAGA's heir apparent, who said in an Aug. 20 Fox News interview that imitating Trump won\u2019t work because it \"ignores the fundamental genius\" of the president\u2019s authenticity. Fox News host Dana Perino, a former White House press secretary, called out how rude the governor\u2019s messages tended to be.\nNewsom seems unruffled by the blowback.\n\"I mean, even poor Kid Rock \u2013 these guys, they\u2019ve gotten a little precious, haven\u2019t they? The folks at Fox (News) are like, \u2018Oh, this is so unbecoming of a governor. Oh, oh,\u2019\u201d Newsom said in an Aug. 20 interview with The Siren, a progressive-leaning podcast show on YouTube. \u201cAnd meanwhile, they sit there reading his tweets every single day.\u201d\nNewsom\u2019s summer swagger appears to be helping him generate buzz, according to an August poll from Echelon Insights that shows him the second-most preferred 2028 candidate among Democrats.\nThat survey finds Newsom holding 13% support, up from 4% in the same survey in April. He's in second place behind Kamala Harris, the former vice president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, who recently opted against running in 2026 to succeed Newsom in California, while leaving the door open to launching another White House bid.\nIn the aftermath of the 2024 election loss, there have been \u201ca lot of donor summits\u201d about how the party can capture and keep people\u2019s attention, said Democratic strategist Alyssa Cass.\nRepublicans have a deeper bench of superstars who can do that, she said, but Newsom, as governor of California, is better positioned to fill that void in the early 2028 jockeying.\nIn January, he had some of the earliest fights with Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress over conditions being set on federal aid to California amid January's catastrophic wildfires. About four months later, the president sent thousands of National Guard members into Los Angeles in response to protests against the administration's ICE deportation crackdown.\nCalifornia's size, plus those prior clashes, put Newsom in a \"prime position to be Trump slayer,\" for base Democrats, Cass said.\n\"Now with redistricting, he\u2019s in the middle of the ring again,\" she said. \"He is doing everything he can to turn that target on his back into a rallying post for Democratic voters across the country.\"\nOther 2028 Dem hopefuls take note but offer few criticisms, solutions\nWeeks before Trump was sworn in for a second term, Democrats were batting over how much to confront or cooperate with the returning president.\nFor much of the year, anyone aligned with Trump got scorched by the party's base. In April, some liberals skewered Whitmer after the Michigan governor unexpectedly appeared in the Oval Office while the president signed executive orders, with cameras clicking as she hugged Trump and hid her face behind file folders.\nWhitmer\u2019s PAC did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\nAsked if other Democrats should follow his communication strategy, Newsom told reporters earlier this week that he wasn\u2019t going \"to offer any advice\" but he believes the party has to evolve.\n\"This is a different presidency. It requires a different approach than we\u2019ve seen in the past,\" Newsom said in response to USA TODAY\u2019s question.\nDemocratic strategists say the party wants a fighter and other 2028 hopefuls are otherwise occupied building up their brand or have smaller positions of influence. Other Democrats in the crowded constellation of possible White House contenders have chimed in but gained limited traction.\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, a fundraising juggernaut who is regularly touted as a 2028 contender, called for an \"even board\" in July.\n\"If Republicans want to play by these rules, then I think we shouldn't have one set of rules for one and one set of rules for another,\" the 35-year-old congresswoman said.\nNot every progressive is on board with the California governor's eye-for-an-eye view.\nSome point out that he is accelerating a race to the bottom in terms of partisan gerrymandering, suggesting it is wrongheaded for Democrats to embrace this strategy because it joins the GOP in disenfranchising millions of voters.\n\u201cRemember, (Sen. John) Fetterman had good tweets, too,\" Nina Turner, a former co-chair of Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, said in an Aug. 20 post on X.\nIf the current course of events continues, election reformers warn, the Democratic strategy of \"going lower\" like Newsom is doing could further plunge Congress and the country into partisan trenches."

      "text": "Gavin Newsom tops Kamala Harris in 2028 presidential poll of California Democrats\nWASHINGTON \u2015 In a battle between two Californians considering Democratic runs for president in 2028, Gov. Gavin Newsom holds a slight edge over former Vice President Kamala Harris, according to a new poll.\nThe poll, conducted by Politico and The Citrin Center public opinion firm, found Newsom is the top choice of 25% of California's Democratic voters in the 2028 Democratic primary, leading all prospective candidates including Harris, the 2024 Democratic nominee, who is supported by 19% of the state's Democrats.\nThe two high-profile Californians are followed in the poll by former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (13%), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (10%), Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (4%) and New Jersey U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (4%).\nU.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-California, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear each has support from 3% of the state's Democratic voters, the poll found.\nThe Democratic breakdown was taken from a subset of 1,445 registered California voters polled between July 28 and Aug. 12.\nAlthough early in the 2028 presidential election cycle, the poll offers a glimpse into the thinking of Democrats in a state that is the party's power center and home to the largest number of Democratic voters. For both Newsom and Harris, winning their home state would be critical to secure the Democratic nomination in 2028 if they decide to run.\nNewsom, who has acknowledged he might run for president in 2028, has become one of the party's most forceful and visible critics of President Donald Trump. He recently launched a redistricting campaign in California with national implications to redraw the state's congressional maps to counter Republican redistricting efforts in Texas.\nHarris, the former Democratic nominee who lost to Trump in the 2024 election, on July 30 announced she would be passing on a 2026 run for governor to replace Newsom, whose term is set to end. Harris's decision opened the door for a possible presidential bid in 2028, though several other Democratic contenders have started to make moves toward their own runs.\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

Holley \"sketched his first draft of the Cracker Barrel logo on a napkin,\" according to the company.\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.
