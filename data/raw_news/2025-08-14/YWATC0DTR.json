  "title": "Enterprise GenAI Startup Cohere Confirms $500M Raise At $6.8B Valuation And Taps Ex-Meta VP As New AI Chief",
  "description": "Toronto-based generative AI startup Cohere, founded by ex-Google researchers, announced Thursday that it has raised $500 million at a $6.8 billion valuation.",
  "content": "Generative AI startup Cohere announced Thursday that it has raised $500 million at a $6.8 billion valuation.\n\nThe news confirms an early June report that the company was seeking to raise over $500 million at a valuation of more than $5.5 billion.\n\nInovia Capital and Radical Ventures co-led the round, which included participation from AMD Ventures, Nvidia, PSP Investments, Salesforce Ventures 1, and others.\n\nFounded by ex-Google researchers, Toronto-based Cohere is just one of many companies developing innovative AI models. It competes with the likes of OpenAI, Google and Anthropic. However, it has not created a consumer-facing app. Instead, it builds custom AI models that perform tasks such as writing website copy and powering chatbots for enterprises including Dell, Notion and Oracle.\n\nAs its platform is cloud-agnostic, Cohere can be deployed inside public clouds, virtual private clouds, a customer\u2019s own cloud, or on-site.\n\nSince its 2019 inception, Cohere has now raised about $1.5 billion, according to Crunchbase data. Other backers include Alumni Ventures, Index Ventures, Radical Ventures and SentinelOne. Its most recent funding round was in July 2024, when it raised a $500 million Series D.\n\nCohere also announced Thursday that it has tapped Joelle Pineau, a former VP of AI research at Meta, to serve as its \u201cchief AI officer,\u201d and Francois Chadwick, former CFO of Shield AI, to serve as its chief financial officer.\n\nThe company noted that over the past year, it has released a \u201csuite\u201d of new enterprise-grade AI products, including generative and retrieval models and its flagship \u201csecurity-first\u201d agentic AI platform, North.\n\nOne of Cohere\u2019s co-founders is Aidan Gomez, who co-authored Google\u2019s \u201cAttention is All You Need,\u201d \u200b\u200ba technical paper believed to have laid the foundation for many of today\u2019s most capable generative AI models.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with Cohere\u2019s operations who wished to remain anonymous, the company doubled its annual recurring revenue earlier this year, crossing the $100 million mark in May. Cohere also competes with tech giants such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which also sell AI models to enterprises.\n\nIn recent times, artificial intelligence startups have been getting the largest share of venture funding. Over the past year, nearly half of U.S. venture funding went to AI-related enterprises, Crunchbase data shows. AI dominates globally as well. Per Crunchbase\u2019s global funding report, AI was the leading sector for venture funding in Q1 2025, with $59.6 billion invested. The first quarter also came in as the strongest for AI funding ever, with a staggering 53% of global funding going to the AI sector alone.\n\n\u201cWe have been proud investors and partners with Cohere and its founders since day one, with a vision to deliver leading AI for business,\u201d said Jordan Jacobs, co-founder and managing partner of Radical Ventures, in a written statement. \u201cCohere is fulfilling that promise by building privacy-first, cloud-agnostic models and agentic AI applications that are driving extraordinary productivity gains and ROI to blue-chip enterprises, businesses and governments worldwide.\u201d\n\u2022 AI Share Of Startup Funding Fluctuates Sharply By Stage\n\u2022 Q1 Global Startup Funding Posts Strongest Quarter Since Q2 2022 With A Third Going To Massive OpenAI Deal",
