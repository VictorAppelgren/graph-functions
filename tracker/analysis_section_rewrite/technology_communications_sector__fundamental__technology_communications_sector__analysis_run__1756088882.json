      "feedback": "This draft has the right core thesis but needs a disciplined, multi‑year, first‑principles framework and tighter, number‑driven scoping; actionable edits: 1) embed a true multi‑period, structure‑driven anchor set for a structural horizon (state a regime‑invariant frame using first principles such as the durability of debt service under long‑run cash flows, real rate differentials, terms‑of‑trade, productivity/potential growth, and policy reaction functions; even if exact BoP or external position data aren’t in the sources, articulate them as anchors to calibrate sensitivity to liquidity and external financing) and flag how these anchors would be updated with external data over time. 2) formalize the causal chain from flows to prices: private‑credit/CMBS liquidity feeds AI infra capex (data centers) anchored by hyperscalers, which in turn supposedly supports long‑dated debt service; price transmission occurs via credit spreads and asset valuations; then state where cash‑flow uncertainty (e.g., OpenAI’s trillions of required spend vs. MIT’s 95% profitability failure) feeds into refinancings and mark‑to‑market stress (cite OBQMETU6O for the debt‑funding channel and payback risk, and S94YUAWG8 for sector performance context). 3) sharpen the scenario structure beyond base case: specify base case, bear case (cash flows underperform, refinancing stress), and policy/regulatory/invalidation risks; include explicit triggers/invalidation points using available numbers (e.g., sustained PIK income around or above 6% as a leverage stress signal; private credit ~$50B/quarter and CMBS exposure +30% to $15.6B as ongoing liquidity milestones; 20–30 year tenors as a structural risk channel) and outline how changes in these metrics would flip regimes. 4) quantify and translate the numerics into transmission, e.g., DSCR pressure if long‑horizon cash flows fail, implicit risk premia from rising PIK, and how NXPI/ON sector moves reflect hardware exposure as a proxy for underlying demand; anchor these with the specific numbers (OBQMETU6O for funding, PIK and tenors, MIT/OpenAI profitability signal; S94YUAWG8 for market backdrop) rather than vague statements. 5) tighten coherence and reconciliation: explicitly acknowledge the duality in the sources—robust liquidity versus profitability risk—and present a single, consistent narrative with a clear call on where conflicts arise and how they resolve under each regime. 6) what to watch and confidence: list concrete watches (private‑credit inflow momentum, CMBS AI exposure, PIK pricing, refinancing spreads, data‑center capex velocity, hyperscaler cash‑flow resilience) and attach a probabilistic confidence band to each regime, with the base case weighted by the observed debt channel (OBQMETU6O) and the market backdrop (S94YUAWG8). 7) formatting: present in the full piece as clearly labeled sections (Anchor framework, Causal chain, Regime map with triggers, Base/bull/bear/invalidation, What to watch, Confidence) while keeping the core quantitative anchors drawn from OBQMETU6O and S94YUAWG8 intact. This will elevate the analysis to a true multi‑year, first‑principles, scenario‑driven piece with precise numbers, clear causal links, and transparent risk–reward signaling.",
