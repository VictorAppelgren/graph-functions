      "summary": "Morningstar warns that the S&P 500’s record concentration in the top ten tech stocks heightens downside risk, as a weak earnings report from a few of those firms could trigger a broad market sell‑off.  The firm also flags a potential pullback if the labor market softens further, prompting the Fed to cut rates, or if inflation remains sticky—especially with tariff‑driven price pressures—forcing the Fed to keep rates high.  Diversifying into international, small‑cap, and healthcare stocks is advised to mitigate the tech‑heavy exposure.",
