  "title": "Google Photos is testing two time-saving changes to sorting and album sharing (APK teardown)",
  "description": "Google is testing new features that help save time while grouping images by face or sharing them with others.",
  "content": "Google Photos does an excellent job of grouping photos of the same person, and even pets, based on their faces. Besides clubbing pictures of other people and automatically associating them with your contacts, the Photos app also recognizes you and organizes photos featuring you. And now, Google is testing a new interface that makes it easier to update preferences for your face.\n\nWe were recently able to activate new changes being tested with version 7.41 of the Google Photos app on Android with some under-the-hood tweaks. Following the change, we now see a new option to \u201cEdit\u201d or \u201cRemove\u201d your assigned face under the \u201cGroup similar faces\u201d options in settings for the Photos app. In the current versions, you must tap the \u201cFace labelled as me\u201d option to choose a face from one of the images visible in the app or remove the existing selection.\n\nThe new options also change how you select the face, replacing the existing grid of photos with new, variably shaped outlines. These outlines focus on the most frequently appearing faces in your camera roll, although a new \u201cShow more\u201d button also allows you to choose a face beyond the initial selection. The shapes remind us of the Material 3 Expressive design that Google is already testing for the Photos app.\n\nThe new interface is seemingly adapted from the different face selection screen that shows up after you have removed the face, albeit a different one appears while editing your choice.\n\nEssentially, the new interface combines two different workflows, making it slightly easier to set the default face as that of the phone\u2019s owner. Once you choose the face, Google Photos also gives you the option to change how your name appears on the album.\n\nCurrently, this requires jumping through hoops by particularly choosing an album of images attached to your name under Collections > People and pets in the Google Photos app. When you reach the screen, you must tap on your face and then your name, followed by a separate screen to edit the name. As with the step above, the new screen reduces the time you would spend editing the name linked to your face on Google Photos.\n\nBesides these changes, Google also appears to be testing a new functionality in Photos where you can add new media to albums owned by others more easily. In the tweaked version, we spotted new options to sort albums by \u201cShared with me\u201d and \u201cMy albums\u201d after choosing the \u201cAdd to album\u201d action.\n\nSince none of these features are actually live in any beta or stable version of the Google Photos app, we can\u2019t commit to whether they will be released. Even if they do, it\u2019s difficult to commit to a specific timeline for the release, and we will have to wait for further insights or any official hints from Google.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f An APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.",

Learn more.\nGoogle Photos' faces row could make searching even easier (APK teardown)\nJuly 23, 2025\n- Google Photos v7.38 includes code for UI refinements, such as a persistent face row in search, which offers faster access to photos and videos of frequently appearing faces.\n- We\u2019ve also spotted a couple of visual changes to the upcoming Create tab and the Remix feature.\nGoogle Photos is due for some significant changes. There are plenty of Material 3 Expressive changes on the horizon, as well as new features like Remix and the Create tab. While we patiently wait for the new changes to arrive, the Google Photos team is hard at work further refining the UI for a better user experience. With Google Photos v7.38, we\u2019ve spotted code for several UI changes for some of these upcoming features, which we enabled to give you an early look.\nAn APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.\nGoogle Photos: Persistent face row in the search section\nStarting off, Google seems to be working towards adding a faces row to the search area. Currently, when you search within your Google Photos library, you can search for people, but you must start inputting text to get relevant face suggestions. In the future, Google Photos will pre-emptively show some of the most commonly appearing faces in your photos library, so you can easily select them to search for all photos where the face appears.\nThe first screenshot above shows the current behavior, while the second screenshot shows the upcoming behavior with the new faces row. The new UI features the search bar at the bottom, which we\u2019ve spotted before but hasn\u2019t yet rolled out.\nIn the third screenshot above, tapping the three-dot button will open the People and pets section with all recognized faces. You can already access this section from the Collections tab, but this change gives the section another logical entry point.\nUpcoming Create tab gets UI changes\nWe\u2019ve already covered the upcoming Create tab within Google Photos, which is destined to consolidate all creation tools, such as Collage, Highlight video, Cinematic photo, and more, into one tab. While the feature has yet to be rolled out, Google is already making changes to its UI, primarily removing the colorful shape masks from over the promo images.\nHere\u2019s a demo video showing the upcoming Create tab with the newly spotted visuals:\nUpcoming Remix promo screen gets changes\nThe upcoming Remix feature also now has a different promo screen:\nThe new promo screen shows more styles in focus, which better represents the feature than the previous promo screen.\nAll of these features are still in development, so there\u2019s a fair possibility of further changes on the horizon. It remains to be seen which direction Google finally settles on for these changes. We\u2019ll keep you updated when we learn more.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nHere's an early look at the Material 3 Expressive changes headed to Google Photos (APK teardown)\nMay 21, 2025\n- Google Photos could soon receive a redesigned homepage that follows Android\u2019s new Material 3 Expressive design language.\n- The updated homepage will replace the app\u2019s name at the top with its icon and introduce a new loading animation.\n- The redesigned homepage is expected to arrive later this year, and Google could make further changes before it hits the stable channel.\nGoogle Photos is set to receive a visual revamp in line with Android\u2019s new Material 3 Expressive design language. Thanks to an official survey, we first got a peek at the app\u2019s redesigned homepage earlier this year. We\u2019ve now spotted the updated interface in the latest Google Photos release (version 7.30) and enabled it manually to give you an early look ahead of the rollout.\nAn APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.\nAs seen previously, Google Photos\u2019 updated homepage no longer features the app\u2019s name at the top. Instead, it only shows the app\u2019s logo in the top left corner. Google has also updated the app\u2019s loading icon to match Android\u2019s Material 3 Expressive changes. We also get another look at the redesigned Memories cards we first spotted in a teardown earlier this month.\nThe current release does not include the floating bottom bar and rounded image previews we saw in the survey, but that doesn\u2019t mean Google has shelved these changes. The company could introduce these elements before the updated homepage reaches users, likely alongside the stable Android 16 QPR1 release later this year. We\u2019ll update this post as soon as we have additional details.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."
