      "feedback": "Overall strength: you tie Cadillac’s Elevated Velocity to GM’s domestic EV push and to tariff/policy dynamics, and you pull in private‑markets/AI/health‑tech and FIRE‑style financing signals to broaden the signal set (IDs WTNT85IPR, EPJYXB7DX, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, GM). To upgrade to world‑class quality in a 3–6 month horizon, tighten the causal chain, sharpen the catalyst map, and quantify every thread. Concrete edits in one paragraph: (1) Define a precise, three‑window catalyst map for 0–2 weeks, 2–8 weeks, and 8–26 weeks, tying each window to a verifiable event (Cadillac Elevated Velocity reveal/GM capex spend cadence; US EV capacity ramp at Orion/FZ/Factory ZERO; the tempo of GM’s U.S. assemblyライン expansion to >2M annual units; and any tariff litigation outcomes—tariff policy is actually in flux per sources like DT/DB notes and court blocks in TRTariffs). (2) Quantify base case with explicit figures drawn from sources: GM’s $4B U.S. manufacturing investment; the >2M annual U.S. vehicle capacity target implied by GM’s expansions; the 25% tariff on imported passenger vehicles and the likelihood of price pass‑through; Deutsche Bank’s note on near‑term pre‑tariff strength; and Pacaso/Mogul metrics (range‑bound signals: Pacaso’s 10 international destinations planning, 1.8T total vacation‑home market, Mogul’s 10k protection and 10–12% cash‑on‑cash yields). (3) Build 1–2 alt scenarios with explicit deltas: Alt A (bullish) tariff clarity achieved, faster pass‑through, stronger dealer pricing power and GM output lift; Alt B (bearish) tariff deadlock or unfavorable litigation reduces near‑term pricing power and slows EV ramp; each with quantified probability weights if possible. (4) Strengthen the invalidation/stop signals: a court ruling blocking tariffs or a material shift in GM’s U.S. capacity timeline would invalidate the auto‑centric base; a sudden AI‑pricing adoption failure or a negative HeartSciences FDA/Medicare milestone would reweight the growth thesis; (5) tighten the “watch list” with concrete leads: GM equity cadence (price/volume signals in the 3–6 month window), tariff announcements/litigation outcomes, Cadillac EV take‑up vs pricing, HeartSciences FDA/Medicare milestones, Pacaso and Mogul fundraising activity, Range AI‑wealth platform uptake. (6) improve grounding by explicitly acknowledging first‑principles drivers (auto demand, supply chain risk, and policy‑driven pricing) and noting how each source supports or conflicts with the others (e.g., WTNT85IPR’s tariff impulse vs EPJYXB7DX’s debt/policy framework; UPV3X2MQ6’s AI productivity thesis vs ILYC1M41F’s FIRE/alternative‑investment signals). (7) Fix framing and avoid overreliance on politically framed sources for market drivers by foregrounding policy events with immediate market impact (tariff policy, court rulings) and treating political coverage as backdrop signals. (8) Citation hygiene: keep IDs WTNT85IPR, EPJYXB7DX, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, and GM in every section that uses their data, and prune any non‑core sources unless they add a needed quantitative anchor; where numbers conflict, present the range and state the reconciliation approach (e.g., tariff timing vs. court rulings). Implementing these edits will yield a tight, defensible 3–6 month scenario with a concrete path/dependency, explicit timing windows, base case and alts, risk log, and a disciplined watch‑list that matches the SECTION FOCUS.",
