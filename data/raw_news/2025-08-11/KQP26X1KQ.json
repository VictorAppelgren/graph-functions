  "content": "Cam Heyward is currently at Steelers training camp, but the defensive lineman isn\u2019t ruling out a holdout if he and the team can\u2019t renegotiate a contract extension he signed last year.\n\nThe Steelers defender told reporters on Monday that his camp approached the Steelers about his contract during the scouting combine in February and indicated that the organization asked him to take a pay cut in 2023 after he had a season riddled with injuries.\n\nNews of Heyward\u2019s contract request and hold-in first came to light last week.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely options out there that could reflect that,\u201d he said, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\n\nHeyward signed a three-year, $45 million extension last year, but had told the front office to be ready to return to the bargaining table if he had a strong 2024.\n\n\u201cI understand I signed a contract last year, but to be completely honest with you, when I signed that, I told them, \u2018When I have an All-Pro year, expect me to come back [to the bargaining table],\u201d\u2018 Heyward said. \u201cI think everybody kind of giggled a little bit. I used it as motivation.\u201d\n\nHeyward went on to record 71 tackles, 12 tackles for loss and earned All-Pro honors while also being named to the Pro Bowl.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m looking to be valued,\u201d Heyward said. \u201cIn my eyes, when I look around at my position, I think I\u2019m 22nd [in compensation] as a defensive tackle, I\u2019m 32nd as a defensive lineman. I know what I bring to this team and what I\u2019m capable of on and off the field. It\u2019s hard for me, after the year I had, to justify playing at the number I\u2019m playing at.\u201d\n\nHeyward has been at camp, attending meetings and practices and expressed that his goal was \u201cto be out here\u201d while adding that he didn\u2019t \u201cknow what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",

      "text": "The Steelers have some more demands to handle.\nAfter reaching a record-breaking agreement with T.J. Watt, Pittsburgh has another All-Pro defensive lineman to try and keep happy with Cameron Heyward seeking a restructured deal.\nIn a defensive market that has skyrocketed, with Watt being a $123 million piece of that boom, Heyward is reportedly seeking a raise to fit the market reset, but he has not been fully participating in training camp while he negotiates, according to ESPN.\nThe 36-year-old has two years left on his current deal, a three-year extension he signed just last September that will pay him $14.75 million this season and $14.5 million the next.\nUnder his current contract, he enters the season as the 36th-highest-paid defensive lineman and the 18th-highest-paid defensive tackle.\nWhile he\u2019s nearing 40 years old, Heyward has still been one of the NFL\u2019s top interior defensive linemen, and he nabbed a First Team All-Pro selection this past season to show for it.\nHeyward racked up 71 total tackles and eight sacks in the 2024-25 season, and his All-Pro nod made him the first defensive lineman older than 35 to be voted for the honor since Bruce Smith in 1998.\nEntering his 15th season with Pittsburgh, Heyward and the team have reportedly discussed his wishes privately, but have not made any progress on a restructured deal as he continues to not be a full participant at camp.\nPittsburgh has been a big spender this offseason, as Watt\u2019s three-year, $123 million contract has him as the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history.\nThe Steelers also gave newly acquired wide receiver DK Metcalf four years, $132 million.\nThey will also pay newcomers Aaron Rodgers ($13 million), Jalen Ramsey ($26.6 million) and Jonnu Smith ($12 million).\nHeyward isn\u2019t the only All-Pro Steeler looking for a raise either, as kicker Chris Boswell has also been privately seeking a new contract.\nBoswell was First Team All-Pro last season but was the lowest-paid kicker in the AFC North."

That was pretty intense and emotional.\u201d\nPawol worked first base during the first game of Saturday\u2019s doubleheader and third base for the second game.\n\u201cShe did a good job,\u201d Braves manager Brian Snitker said Saturday. \u201cYou can tell she knows what she does.\u201d\nPawol is a rover called up from the minors, so her next MLB assignment is unclear."

I\u2019m 1,000 percent sure that it\u2019ll happen.\u201d\nThe couple\u2019s engagement comes more than three years after a federal civil case accusing Ronaldo of raping a 25-year-old woman in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009 was dismissed.\nKathryn Mayorga, a former school teacher, claimed Ronaldo, who was 24 at the time, raped her at the Palms Place in 2009. The allegations were first reported in 2017 by German magazine Der Spiegel.\nUS District Judge Jennifer Dorsey dismissed the case with prejudice, due to misconduct by Mayorga\u2019s attorney, Leslie Mark Stovall, who used \u201cpurloined\u201d confidential documents.\nStovall was ordered to pay a proportion of Ronaldo\u2019s legal costs."
