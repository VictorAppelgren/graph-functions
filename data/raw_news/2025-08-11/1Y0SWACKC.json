  "description": "Sanchez allegedly admitted to shooting Sanchez to \u201clet off some steam\u201d in a premeditated plan to \u201ctake [his stress] out on anybody he could find.\u201d",
  "content": "A deranged New Mexico teenager grinned in his mugshot after he was arrested last week for allegedly killing his Uber driver \u201cto let some steam off\u201d after a stressful day, according to a criminal complaint.\n\nSheliky Sanchez, 18, was cuffed at his girlfriend\u2019s home in Albuquerque early Thursday morning and charged with murder, armed robbery and tampering with evidence.\n\nThe night before, Sanchez had asked his unwitting girlfriend to order him an Uber around 1 a.m. \u2014 telling her \u201chis friend has a car for him and he is going to go get it,\u201d according to a complaint obtained by the Albuquerque Journal.\n\nWhen the Uber suddenly stopped before the ride was completed, the company sent Sanchez\u2019s girlfriend an automated call to make sure everything was alright, she told police.\n\nShe reached out to Sanchez, who insisted he was fine.\n\nAround 3 a.m., Uber driver Joseph Andrus was found dead after apparently being shot execution-style on the side of the road.\n\nHis car, a black Ford Escape, was nowhere in sight.\n\nSanchez allegedly stole the Ford after the murder and drove the car to his girlfriend\u2019s house, where it was found by authorities in the morning.\n\nWhen interviewed by police, Sanchez insisted that he had slept through the whole night. He added that he hadn\u2019t taken an Uber anywhere and was driven around by his friends, according to the complaint.\n\nSanchez claimed to police that he used cash to buy Andrus\u2019 car from someone else and had no knowledge it belonged to the slain driver, according to the complaint.\n\nAs police poked holes in his flimsily alibi, Sanchez allegedly eventually admitted to shooting Sanchez to \u201clet off some steam\u201d in a premeditated plan to \u201ctake [his stress] out on anybody he could find,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nSanchez allegedly told police he parsed through multiple different rideshare apps before deciding on his victim.\n\nHe added that he chose a random drop-off location and ordered Andrus to exit the vehicle upon arrival before allegedly shooting him several times and watching as he bled out on the ground.\n\n\u201cHe seemed like a good guy. I don\u2019t really go for good people,\u201d Sanchez told police, adding that Andrus was \u201creally cool and talked to him the entire drive.\u201d\n\nSanchez added that he \u201cfelt bad for [Andrus] a little bit, but just getting that satisfaction out of the way. It\u2019s like a relief. Like taking an in and out breath.\u201d\n\nThe teen is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Bernalillo County, New Mexico.",

      "text": "Illegal migrant who raped, killed Rachel Morin sat emotionless at sentencing in front of her anguished family\nThe Salvadorian illegal migrant who viciously raped and killed Rachel Morin was emotionless as her grieving children remembered their \u201ckind\u201d and \u201cdetermined\u201d mom at his sentencing Monday \u2014 where he was given life without the possibility of parole.\nHarford County Circuit Court Judge Yolanda Curtin threw the book at Victor Martinez-Hernandez, 24, after an hours-long hearing Monday where Morin\u2019s family members, including four of her five children, delivered emotional victim impact statements.\nMorin\u2019s eldest daughter described her mom, who has the \u201cbest laugh,\u201d as \u201ckind, strong, honest, determined and funny,\u201d in a heartbreaking written statement she asked the prosecutor to read to the court, WBAL-TV reported.\n\u201cI had to relive the worst two days of my life in order to write this,\u201d the statement from the 20-year-old read.\nHer three youngest children delivered their statements via audio recordings.\n\u201cShe was a good mom,\u201d her son could be heard saying in one recording. \u201cEvery time I see a picture of her I think about the life I had with her and my four sisters. I miss her.\u201d\nMorin\u2019s children range in age from 9 to 20.\n\u201cYou took a life that was not yours to take,\u201d the judge told Martinez-Hernandez, according to WBAL-TV. \u201cYour acts not only brutalized a young woman but also terrorized a community.\n\u201cYou are not a candidate for rehabilitation. There is simply no hope to rehabilitate you.\u201d\nA jury found Martinez-Hernandez guilty in April of murdering Morin, 37, as she was exercising on the Ma & Pa Heritage Trail in Bel Air, Maryland, on Aug. 5, 2023.\nHe strangled her and then bashed her head against rocks before hiding her partially naked body in a drainage culvert on the trail that is about 30 miles northeast of Baltimore.\nMorin\u2019s younger brother, John Morin, said through tears Monday that he\u2019s experienced a \u201ctidal wave of grief\u201d since his sister\u2019s slaying, according to a post on X by ABC 2 reporter Blair Sabol.\nMartinez-Hernandez remained stony-faced and emotionless as the family members told the judge about the toll that Morin\u2019s murder had taken on the family.\nAfter, through a Spanish translator, Martinez-Hernandez addressed the judge, thanking her \u201cfor the opportunity to speak\u201d but that he would \u201cnot be giving any testimony.\u201d\nMorin\u2019s mother, Patty Morin, told the court she has suffered nightmares, panic attacks, and insomnia since her daughter\u2019s death.\n\u201cThe depths of grief are equivalent to the depths of love felt,\u201d Patty said. \u201cThis will impact generations to come.\u201d\nAhead of the sentencing, the heartbroken mom told Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that she didn\u2019t know if she wanted to hear from her daughter\u2019s murderer at the sentencing, because she would never really know if an apology was simply a bid for a lighter penalty.\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know, because even if he spoke, would I believe what he said?\u201d Patty said. \u201cIf he said he was sorry, could I believe that he actually is or if he\u2019s just saying that to you know, to hope for a lesser sentence.\u201d\nThe killer wasn\u2019t captured until nearly a year later in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June 2024, after investigators were able to match the DNA taken from his sock to the DNA found at the crime scene.\nHe was convicted of first-degree murder, first-degree rape, first-degree sexual offense and kidnapping and faced up to life in prison. He didn\u2019t face the death penalty as the Free State doesn\u2019t allow capitol punishment.\nMartinez-Hernandez entered the country illegally after allegedly slaying another woman in his home country of El Salvador.\nMorin\u2019s killing gained national notoriety as an example of former President Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous border policies.\nPatty was outspoken against Biden for his policies, which she blamed for the fact that Martinez-Hernandez was able to get into the country and kill her daughter.\nThe murder of Laken Riley also made headlines as Jose Ibarra, a Tren de Aragua gang member, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for slaying the promising 22-year-old nursing student on Feb. 22, 2024, in Georgia."
