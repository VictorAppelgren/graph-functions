  "description": "Biden climate rules made air-conditioning more expensive. Trump and Congress can reverse them.",
  "content": "President Trump doesn\u2019t hide his dislike of federal appliance regulations, from water-stingy shower heads that he says make it difficult \u201cto take care of my beautiful hair\u201d to new energy-efficient lightbulbs that make him \u201clook orange.\u201d His administration has initiated steps to dial back many such rules. His next priority should be one of the most overregulated appliances\u2014residential central air-conditioning systems.\n\nHome air conditioners fall under the jurisdiction of two hyperaggressive federal agencies, the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Energy Department\u2019s latest efficiency standard for these systems took effect in 2023 and knocked the most affordable models off the market.\n\nNot to be outdone, the Biden EPA issued a rule requiring that systems manufactured after Jan. 1, 2025, use refrigerants that meet new climate-change requirements. This mandate has increased costs by $1,500 per system on average, says Martin Hoover , president of Atlanta-based Empire Heating & Air Conditioning. Mr. Hoover says the higher price is due to both increased equipment prices\u2014systems had to be redesigned for the new refrigerants\u2014and higher labor costs, since these refrigerants are more flammable and require additional precautions during installation. To make matters worse, an EPA-compliant green refrigerant that many equipment makers use, R-454B, is in short supply, and prices have risen substantially.\n\nThese and other regulations, combined with nonregulatory factors such as higher materials costs and rising wages for service technicians, have dramatically increased the cost of buying and installing a new system. A homeowner replacing a 15-year old system that likely cost around $5,000 at the time of installation now faces a price tag \u201cin the $13,000 to $14,000 range,\u201d Mr. Hoover says.",

  "summary": "The cost of residential central air-conditioning systems has significantly increased due to regulations such as the Energy Department's latest efficiency standard for these systems, which took effect in 2023, and the Environmental Protection Agency's requirement that systems manufactured after 2025 use refrigerants that meet new climate-change requirements. These regulations have increased costs by $1,500 per system. The cost of replacing a 15-year-old system now exceeds $13,000 to $14,000. The shortage of an EPA-compliant green refrigerant used in these systems is also contributing to the increase in costs.",

The article focuses on new Energy Department and EPA standards for residential central air conditioners, which have raised costs by redesigning systems for new refrigerants and adding labor precautions. The Biden EPA rule requiring climate\u2011friendly refrigerants, especially the scarce R\u2011454B, has increased average system costs by about $1,500, pushing replacement prices for a 15\u2011year old unit to $13,000\u2013$14,000. These regulatory and non\u2011regulatory factors\u2014higher material costs, wages, and refrigerant shortages\u2014have made new air\u2011conditioning installations significantly more expensive.",
