  "title": "Review: In 'Relay,' a secret fixer will help you disappear \u2014 but what if you get lonely?",
  "description": "An actor of wide range ('Sound of Metal,' 'Nightcrawler'), Riz Ahmed plays a different kind of tech bro, an anonymous helper who shields corporate whistleblowers.",
  "content": "If history has taught us anything, it\u2019s that no one is truly safe. That gathering dread fueled some great \u201970s paranoid thrillers, such as \u201cThe Parallax View\u201d and \u201cThe Conversation,\u201d but it\u2019s been difficult to replicate that eeriness in today\u2019s extremely online world, when our devices explain and obfuscate with abandon, conspiracies are lifeblood and we feel persecuted one day, invincibly anonymous the next.\n\nThe nifty premise of \u201cRelay,\u201d a new white-knuckle ride from \u201cHell or High Water\u201d director David Mackenzie, is that a certain type of tech-savvy hero can, if not completely ease your anxiety, at least navigate a secret truce with those out to get you. And Riz Ahmed\u2019s solitary off-the-grid fixer, Ash, who hides in plain sight in bustling New York, can do it without ever meeting or talking to you: His preferred mode of traceless communication is the text-telephone service that hard-of-hearing people use in conjunction with message-relaying operators. Like a ready-made covert operation, it keeps identities, numbers and call logs secret.\n\nFor the simple fact that \u201cRelay\u201d is not about an assassin (the movies\u2019 most over-romanticized independent contractor), screenwriter Justin Piasecki\u2019s scenario deserves kudos. Rather, Ash\u2019s broker helps potential whistleblowers escape the clutches of dangerously far-reaching entities \u2014 unless, of course, they want to settle for cash. It\u2019s a fascinatingly cynical update: Should we make an uneasy peace with our tormentors? (Hello, today\u2019s headlines.)\n\nBefore those questions get their due, however, \u201cRelay\u201d sets itself up with clockwork precision as a straightforward big-city nail-biter about staying one step ahead. Seeking protection from harassment and a return to normal life, rattled biotech scientist Sarah (Lily James) goes on the run with incriminating documents about her former employer. When she\u2019s rebuffed by a high-powered law firm, she\u2019s provided a mysterious number to call. Ash, armed with his elaborate vetting methods, puts Sarah through the paces with rules and instructions regarding burner phones, mailed packages and a detailed itinerary of seemingly random air travel. It doesn\u2019t just test her commitment, though \u2014 it\u2019s also a ploy to scope out the corporate goons on her trail: a dogged surveillance team led by Sam Worthington (who should maybe only play bad guys) and Willa Fitzgerald.\n\nAs the story careens through airports and post offices and New York\u2019s hidey-holes, the cat-and-mouse chase is dizzyingly enjoyable, worthy of a Thomas Perry novel. We wait for the missteps that threaten everything, of course, and they begin with learning that Ash is a failed whistleblower himself, one who is beginning to question his chosen crusade. Another vulnerability, recognizable in the occasional cracks in Ahmed\u2019s commanding stoicism, is the loneliness of the gig. So when a restive Sarah, on one of their protected calls, gently prods for a smidgen of personality from her mysterious unseen helper, one is inclined to shout, \u201cNo feelings! Too risky!\u201d\n\nBut that, of course, is the slippery pleasure of \u201cRelay,\u201d which pits individuals against venal institutional might. Flaws are the beating hearts of these movies, triggering the peril that makes the blood pump faster. Some of that effectiveness is undercut by some off-putting music choices, but McKenzie\u2019s command of the material is rock solid, Giles Nuttgens\u2019 cinematography achieves a sleek, moody metallic chill and Matt Mayer\u2019s editing is always fleet. In a year that\u2019s already given us one superlative case of adult peekaboo \u2014 Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cBlack Bag\u201d \u2014 \u201cRelay\u201d proves there\u2019s still more room for smart, punchy cloak-and-dagger options.",

      "text": "- Share via\n1\nIt\u2019s taken a few false starts to get Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender on the same Zoom call. She\u2019s been preparing to open a production of \u201cThe Seagull\u201d at the Barbican in London, her first time onstage since 2019. He\u2019s been on a much-needed holiday with his family before returning home to Lisbon. Perhaps that\u2019s why, in an hour that finally aligns with everyone\u2019s schedule, it feels genuinely miraculous to hear the two actors share stories of their craft.\nThere\u2019s a lighthearted moment of catching up between them, reuniting after shooting Steven Soderbergh\u2019s spy thriller \u201cBlack Bag\u201d last spring. Fassbender wants to know how she feels about the play\u2019s opening night (a bit nervous), and Blanchett is curious if he wrapped his series \u201cThe Agency\u201d (yes, in December). They have an easy shorthand that suggests a long history. But in truth, they only shared a handful of encounters before making \u201cBlack Bag.\u201d\nThey recall meeting at various awards shows in 2014, when Fassbender was Oscar-nominated as a supporting actor in Steve McQueen\u2019s \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d and Blanchett won the lead actress award for Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cBlue Jasmine.\u201d A few years later, they were on set in Austin, Texas, for Terrence Malick\u2019s elliptical 2017 drama \u201cSong to Song.\u201d\n\u201cWe actually did a scene together in that,\u201d Fassbender remembers.\n\u201cIf you can call it that,\u201d Blanchett cracks. She\u2019s sparky but focused as she sits in her home office. \u201cI don\u2019t think it made the film. I don\u2019t think anything I did in that movie ever made the film. It was in that phase where Terry, having come off the back of making one film a decade, made three or four in a row.\u201d\n\u201cHe literally did \u2018Knight of Cups\u2019 and then straight into \u2018Song to Song,\u2019\u201d Fassbender recalls, speaking from what appears to be a very ornate living room with tall ceilings, before asking Blanchett, \u201cDid you do \u2018Knight of Cups\u2019 as well?\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d she affirms. \u201cBut likewise I don\u2019t know whether anything I did was in the movie. But that\u2019s the contract, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nNot so with their current director, Soderbergh, whose efficiency and command are legendary. \u201cYou know that when you work with him, absolutely everything you shoot will be in it,\u201d Blanchett says, with a sense of pride. She grins, adding, \u201cAnd, in fact, he\u2019s already shot and edited the thing before any of us have shown up.\u201d\nOften the camera operator on his own films, the Oscar-winning director of \u201cTraffic\u201d had an idea for a first-person horror movie, one that required some stamina.\nIn \u201cBlack Bag,\u201d Blanchett and Fassbender play a married couple who are both high-level spies in the British government. Soderbergh and Blanchett had been planning to collaborate on a different film, but when that didn\u2019t come to fruition, the director pivoted to screenwriter David Koepp\u2019s wry, unconventional take on an espionage story. He and Koepp had previously collaborated on \u201cKimi\u201d and the ghost story \u201cPresence,\u201d and Soderbergh liked that the script had broad appeal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find things that are commercial that are also really good,\u201d Soderbergh told me in London earlier this year. \u201cAnd it had certain challenges in it that were of concern, and I wanted to see if I could pull that off.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a memorable intensity to the filmmaker that can sometimes feel remote. Blanchett admits that, initially, she was \u201cabsolutely terrified\u201d of him.\n\u201cHe was an enigma,\u201d Blanchett says of making 2006\u2019s \u201cThe Good German.\u201d \u201cHe was totally present, but I had no idea how to communicate with him. After that experience, we got to know one another.\u201d\nShe compares him to a peregrine falcon because \u201chis frame rate operates at an entirely different speed to everybody else\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cHe is like a sharp-sighted bird,\u201d Fassbender agrees. \u201cWhen he walks into a room, he clocks everything.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t replicate him,\u201d Blanchett says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with directors who have tried to imitate that relaxed quality that Steven has on set, but he is like a coiled spring. He\u2019ll cut people off midconversation and just start shooting. He\u2019s always ready.\u201d\n\u201cBlack Bag\u201d undercuts traditional spy films by swapping out action in favor of dialogue, notably in the form of two extended dinner party scenes. In the film, Fassbender\u2019s character George Woodhouse is tasked with investigating a mole in the U.K.\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre. He has five suspects, including his elusive, elegant wife, Kathryn St. Jean (Blanchett), one of the organization\u2019s top agents. Both dinner parties are part of an attempt to elicit the truth.\n\u201cI wanted to see if I could get away with a 14-page dinner scene because that\u2019s not supposed to work,\u201d says Koepp, speaking over the phone later from New York. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to have six people sitting at a table and have it build and erupt and hold your attention. I was trying not to do spy-movie tropes, so rather than a car chase before something explodes, I wanted the climax of the movie to be another dinner at the same table.\u201d\nSoderbergh was admittedly daunted but also enticed by the puzzle being presented. \u201cIf you ask any director, \u2018What\u2019s your least favorite kind of scene to shoot?\u2019 I guarantee you \u2018dinner table\u2019 is going to be right at the top of the survey,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I thought, \u2018Can I come up with a way to execute this in which I\u2019m invisible to the audience but the scene is still moving?\u2019\u201d\nUsually, Blanchett says, Soderbergh likes to have long restaurant meals with his cast ahead of shooting. This time, she and Fassbender only joined him for one.\n\u201cI think because he knew he was going to be filming dinner scenes, it was making him anxious,\u201d Blanchett deadpans. \u201cHis blood pressure was going up.\u201d\n\u201cWe should have gone out paintballing or something,\u201d Fassbender suggests.\n\u201cNext time,\u201d she agrees. \u201cHe always has to have an impossible challenge for himself as a filmmaker. He loves to not know how to do something. He doesn\u2019t like it to be easy for himself, which is counterintuitive to the atmospheres that he creates on set, which is so relaxed.\u201d\nTypically, Soderbergh doesn\u2019t invite his cast to rehearse. He puts his trust in the casting process and empowers the actors to get the job done. But these dinner table sequences were blocked ahead of time because of the technical challenges \u2014 which led Soderbergh to take out the middle of the dining table and get inside the hole with the camera.\n\u201cWe did rehearse those, but it was for him, really,\u201d Fassbender explains, himself a veteran of the filmmaker\u2019s process from 2011\u2019s thriller \u201cHaywire.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s kind of terrifying about Steven, which I had forgotten, is you do one take and he\u2019s like, OK, moving on.\u2019 And you\u2019re like, \u2018Wait a minute!\u2019 He gives a lot of trust to everybody.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, the dinner table scenes are taut and dynamic. The camera moves between characters rapidly, resulting in a sense of excitement and unease, and the climatic revelation of the mole is genuinely thrilling. It\u2019s no wonder the actors enjoyed the experience of making \u201cBlack Bag\u201d so much, particularly coming off such demanding films as \u201cT\u00e1r\u201d and Fassbender\u2019s \u201cThe Killer\u201d for David Fincher.\n\u201cThe thing with working on film is that you\u2019re always full of regret,\u201d Blanchett acknowledges. Fassbender nods his head: \u201cThe drive home,\u201d he says.\nBlanchett continues, \u201cBut with Steven, he always keeps the sets open, so if he goes home at the end of the night and looks at the edit and realizes he didn\u2019t get a shot, or we need another line, or a character needs an extra beat, we can go back and do it. You don\u2019t necessarily get that time up front, but he considers all of it as he\u2019s moving through the thing, which is really fascinating.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve become better at letting go lightly. But I do look back on the thing, the object, with a touch of melancholy,\u201d the actor says of moving on from things in her life, like her Oscar-nominated film.\nKoepp conceived \u201cBlack Bag\u201d while writing the first \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d film in the mid-\u201990s. During his research, he interviewed several CIA advisors about their careers and personal lives.\n\u201cI was struck that many of them felt like it\u2019s really hard to maintain a relationship when you lie for a living,\u201d Koepp recalls. \u201cI carried that in the back of my mind for quite some time. Marriage is the ultimate trust institution. Those of us who are in long-term marriages feel like: This is settled and this is safe. I wanted to do something where there was suspicion and unease but not about whether the person is cheating or not. It\u2019s about whether they are betraying their country or not.\u201d\nAlthough very little of Kathryn and George\u2019s backstory is revealed in the film, they have an unbreakable bond and a clear attraction. They skillfully navigate between their relationship and their jobs \u2014 if there\u2019s anything the other can\u2019t know, it goes in a metaphorical \u201cblack bag.\u201d That trust is shaken, though, when George begins to suspect Kathryn\u2019s activities.\n\u201cPart of what people find interesting about spies, particularly spies in cinema, is their interiority,\u201d Blanchett says. \u201cThat tightrope walk between a deep morality and operating in a totally amoral space. And in a marriage, there are secrets. You do protect your partner from things. There has to be, in order for a relationship to last.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re constantly operating from a paranoid perspective on things, which is what keeps them alive and keeps them in the job,\u201d Fassbender adds. \u201cEven in the department they work in, you have to keep an eye over your shoulder. A sociopath does pretty well in this environment, but you don\u2019t want too many sociopaths in the same department.\u201d\n\u201cBlack Bag\u201d is Fassbender\u2019s second time playing a spy during the last year. On the series \u201cThe Agency,\u201d from Paramount+ with Showtime, he portrays hardened CIA agent Martian, who is working in London after a long deep-cover assignment. Both projects were offered to him within days of each other, although the similarity was not intentional.\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing spies now,\u201d Fassbender jokes. Blanchett, his perfect audience, laughs. He quips, \u201cI just love lying to everyone.\u201d Still, the actor was able to find specifics to \u201cBlack Bag\u2019s\u201d George that differed from Martian. It helped that Soderbergh approached the genre with notable warmth.\n\u201cThe depressiveness of that job, which you can see in a lot of spy movies, is not there on the screen,\u201d Fassbender says. \u201cIt looks sexy. It\u2019s slick. That\u2019s a very smart thing he\u2019s done for this particular story. Usually there\u2019s loneliness and isolation when you see spies who have been through a career for 25 years.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of chutzpah in being a spy,\u201d says Blanchett. \u201cThey\u2019re very serious people, but they\u2019re also so much fun. They can\u2019t have boundaries because they don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to have to cross them. There\u2019s a fluidity to them, but that fluidity is just masking an enormous amount of damage.\u201d\nSoderbergh\u2019s speedy filmmaking style allowed the actors to discover moments together on set, which they both enjoyed. Blanchett describes the director as \u201cincredibly precise, but there\u2019s a flow to him.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s totally able to pivot,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes you can overthink things. I used to think, coming from the theater, that if you have all the time in the world, you\u2019ll get the perfect moment. And then you just string those perfect moments together. A lot of films, they have all the money and time in the world, and all the life gets leeched out of them, which is not the case for Steven.\u201d\n\u201cRestriction sometimes brings freedom,\u201d Fassbender notes.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Blanchett agrees. \u201cAlthough you don\u2019t want to say that to too many studio heads.\u201d\nHow do they deal with the pressure that still comes, even with all their years of experience?\n\u201cWe both get into cold water in the morning,\u201d Blanchett says. She means this literally: On set during \u201cBlack Bag,\u201d the two discovered that each begins their day with an ice bath as a way of building focus. Blanchett even took her family to the Arctic Circle over New Year\u2019s and they all leapt into a fjord.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you the details,\u201d she tells Fassbender, like she\u2019s sharing a state secret, \u201cIt was really special.\u201d\nHer conspiratorial air vanishes as the hour comes to an end and her focus shifts back to \u201cThe Seagull.\u201d Like spies, actors know how to adapt as they go."

      "text": "Author Opens a New Chapter of Writing Life\n- Share via\nStudio City writer Thomas Perry has just made a professional leap of faith.\nHe has announced that his new book, \u201cBlood Money,\u201d will be the last to feature his popular Native American heroine, Jane Whitefield.\nIt is not as if the fine suspense series of which this is the fifth book were not popular.\nPublished only last month, the book has already sold out a first printing of 33,000 copies, and Random House is furiously printing more to fill back orders.\nMoreover, a New Jersey newspaper, reviewing the book, gushed: \u201cLife is good because the new Thomas Perry is out.\u201d The reviewer went on to describe Perry\u2019s series about a young Seneca Indian woman who helps endangered people disappear as a formula novel \u201cthe way chocolate is a formula and champagne is a formula. It\u2019s a formula that\u2019s always great.\u201d\nBut Perry, winner of mystery writing\u2019s top prize, the Edgar, insists \u201cBlood Money\u201d is \u201cthe fifth and, theoretically, the final book\u201d about his professional Native American \u201cvanisher.\u201d\nWriting a series compared to chocolate and champagne is great, Perry says, \u201cbut it\u2019s not necessarily what you want to do with the rest of your writing career.\u201d\nPerry decided to shelve his critically acclaimed \u201cvanisher\u201d not because he tired of her or because he felt the quality of the books was slipping, but because he wanted to continue to grow as a writer.\n\u201cI could probably keep writing these things for the rest of my life and they wouldn\u2019t get any worse, but I wouldn\u2019t get any better,\u201d he says. And then he adds what so many people forget to their ultimate dismay: \u201cIf you can\u2019t do your best work, you\u2019re wasting your life.\u201d\nAlthough Perry plans no further Whitefield exploits, he says, \u201cI\u2019m leaving the door open.\u201d He had originally planned to kill Jane off, but he was acutely aware of the mess writers who murder popular protagonists find themselves in if they ever have to resurrect them.\nRemember the serious tap-dancing Arthur Conan Doyle had to do to explain how Sherlock Holmes survived his tumble off the Reichenbach Falls. Or the tortured explanations the soap-opera writers of the hilarious movie \u201cSoap Dish\u201d had to come up with to explain how character Rod Randall could return after he was decapitated in an earlier episode.\nPerry says he wanted to avoid having to write a scene at some future time in which Jane is in the shower and realizes that she only dreamed that she had died.\nWhen Perry first discussed making \u201cBlood Money\u201d the last Whitefield book, his editor at Random House immediately advised him, \u201cDon\u2019t kill her.\u201d When he asked why, she answered, \u201cAs soon as you do, you\u2019ll think of something you can\u2019t bear not to write about her.\u201d That seemed like sound advice to Perry.\nBefore writing the Whitefield books, which are rich with lore about the Senecas of Perry\u2019s native western New York, he published five earlier suspense novels--each distinctive--including the Edgar-winning \u201cThe Butcher\u2019s Boy\u201d and \u201cMetzger\u2019s Dog.\u201d\nLiberated from the assumptions about Jane\u2019s nature and behavior that shaped the series, he has already all but completed two new novels.\nHesitant to talk too much about them, Perry says the first, tentatively called \u201cDeath Benefits,\u201d is done. It\u2019s about a middle-aged insurance investigator and his younger protege investigating a fraud in the course of which the young man \u201clearns what planet he really lives on.\u201d\nAnd Perry\u2019s currently finishing the last chapter of the second book. It deals with a professional killer and a detective who are both profoundly alike and deeply dissimilar.\n\u201cThe fun of the book,\u201d Perry says, \u201cis that these guys are the best, the absolute best, and they lay traps for each other and, then, the other will turn the trap into a weapon.\u201d\nNo one else has read the manuscript yet, he says, not even his wife.\n*\nI greatly enjoyed Thomas Perry\u2019s early work, but I have a special affection for the Jane Whitefield books.\nSeveral years ago, my dearest childhood friend, Toni Flores, was dying of ovarian cancer. As teenagers in Philadelphia, we had had heated, probably nonsensical arguments about Dostoevsky and our other favorite writers. But, as Toni\u2019s illness progressed, this enormously gifted, warm, courageous woman (an anthropologist, poet, college professor, actress, dancer and mother of five) had the great good sense to read for something of almost unimaginable value--for pleasure.\nA month or two before her death on Nov. 3, 1997, she asked if I had a mystery I thought she might enjoy and mentioned how much she liked the Jane Whitefield books (Toni taught in upstate New York and loved both Jane\u2019s valor and the books\u2019 Seneca lore). I think it was Perry\u2019s \u201cVanishing Act\u201d I gave her.\nIf one measure of a writer is his readers, Perry will surely be proud to know that his admirers included the extraordinary woman who wrote this poem for the youngest of her children, not yet in their teens:\nFOR JOHN AND ANTHONY, in case of an accident\nWait for me. When you feel alone,\nwhen you want to tell me something,\nwhenever you smell the smoke of burning pine,\nright then, stop. Wait.\nWhen you see a pink sky, and say\n\u201cShe would say, \u2018Look!\u2019 \u201d\nwait for me. When you kiss someone,\nlook over the edge of a snowmound,\ncut yourself, get a wart, learn\na theorem, wait, wait. Open\nto the waiting. And when the line\nof a roof, or the line of a song,\nor the line of a rabbit\u2019s tracks\nin the first snow wring the breath\nfrom you, wait for me, and you will find\nthat I am already there.\n--Toni Flores, April 1994"

      "text": "Mark Olsen writes about all kinds of movies for the Los Angeles Times as both a feature writer and reviewer.\n- Share via\n1\n\u201cSplitsville\u201d lands at a moment when every comedy released to theaters feels like a battle cry, an attempt to defend audiences\u2019 rights to have a good time at the movies.\nDirected by Michael Angelo Covino, who also produces, co-writes and co-stars alongside Kyle Marvin, the film continues the duo\u2019s comic exploration of bad choices, in which men predictably make poor decisions and are depicted as vain, infantile and often motivated by their worst impulses. (It\u2019s funny because it\u2019s true.)\nAs the movie begins, Carey (Marvin) is married to Ashley (Adria Arjona), who tells him she has been seeing other people and wants a divorce. He seeks solace from his best friend Paul (Covino) and his wife, Julie (Dakota Johnson), who tell Carey they are in an open relationship. Soon Carey sleeps with Julie and all sorts of jealousies and complicated feelings arise among the four of them.\n\u201cSplitsville\u201d \u2014 the title appears briefly onscreen as the neon sign of a dessert stand \u2014 is outwardly a satire of bourgeois aspirations, modern marriage and how no one really understands the dynamics of what goes on with other couples. But the film is actually more concerned with the absurdities of male friendship, to the extent that Covino and Marvin are perennially enamored of themselves and can\u2019t help from centering their own antics.\nOur expectations were set sky high and still we left with an even 10 titles that floored us, including new work from Lynne Ramsay, Jafar Panahi and Nadav Lapid.\nTheir previous movie, \u201cThe Climb,\u201d was also about two friends locked into an up-and-down relationship alternating between of moments of betrayal and gestures of support. While they are not playing the same specific characters from \u201cThe Climb,\u201d they are very much playing the same type. Covino is seemingly more smooth and together, though riddled with insecurities, while Marvin initially appears hapless and vulnerable, with an emotional intelligence that reveals him to be savvier than he first appears. So they basically meet in the middle.\nThe entire movie has a disappointing air of smug self-regard about it, with an expectation the audience will adore everything about the characters as much as they do. What at moments feels like a nascent interrogation of contemporary masculinity ultimately suffers from the very impulses it seems to want to parody. (We hear numerous times that one of them is generously endowed.)\nBoth Arjona and Johnson are asked to play variations on personas they have depicted elsewhere. Arjona has the same earthy warmth she did in \u201cHit Man,\u201d while Johnson exhibits a placid air of controlled chaos similar to what she showed earlier this year in \u201cMaterialists.\u201d They undoubtedly elevate the movie, though too often their characters feel like game pieces manipulated on a board controlled by the film\u2019s male leads.\nJohnson and Arjona are movie stars, beguiling and captivating. Covino and Marvin seem like a couple of guys who somehow wandered onscreen. The tension is never reconciled and is constantly throwing the story off balance.\nIn \u201cThe Climb,\u201d there is a moment where Covino and Marvin briefly wrestle, a ludicrous sight of two grown men tussling on the ground. Here that beat expands into a full-blown fight scene that goes on for more than six minutes, as Paul attacks Carey after learning he slept with Julie. Smashing furniture, breaking drywall, destroying a fish tank (while saving the fish) and somehow singeing off Carey\u2019s eyebrows, the fight scene is the movie\u2019s centerpiece, one of its major selling points and indicative of everything that both works and doesn\u2019t. It is funny, escalating ridiculously, but it is also too outlandish for the characters and the story and only really exists as something that Covino and Marvin simply wanted to do for themselves.\nThey\u2019re good at jokes but much weaker on meaning, stumbling when it comes to making it all add up to something. With a background in advertising, Marvin and Covino are strong on short, punchy ideas conveyed through strong visuals. They may eventually be better served by making work they do not appear in \u2014 their performances are the weakest thing about their movies so far. Even as they remain a promising duo, \u201cSplitsville\u201d never quite fully comes together.\n'Splitsville'\nRated: R, for language throughout, sexual content and graphic nudity\nRunning time: 1 hour, 40 minutes\nPlaying: In limited release Friday, Aug. 22"

      "text": "Review: \u2018Hell or High Water\u2019: When the banks steal from you, is it OK to rob them?\n- Share via\n\u201cHell or High Water\u201d is a gripping heist drama keenly attuned to the outsider politics of our times.\nSet in the desolate sprawl of West Texas, it opens, like many such movies do, with a bank robbery. Outside the building, spray-painted on the wall are the words: \u201c3 tours in Iraq, but no bailout for people like us.\u201d Later, after another holdup, Texas Rangers try to pry information from reluctant witnesses. \u201cBank been robbing me for 30 years,\u201d a man tells them, explaining why he might be a bit vague on supplying helpful details.\nThe film sports two Robin Hoods, brothers Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster), armed with guns, ski masks and a very precise plan. They demand small-denomination bills and hit only branches of one specific bank. You may conclude that they\u2019re crazy or holding a grudge. Both observations turn out to be true, though, of the two, it\u2019s Tanner, one year removed from a 10-year jail stretch, who\u2019s the more volatile of the two.\n\u201cHow\u2019d you manage to stay out of prison for a year?\u201d Toby asks his older brother.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been difficult,\u201d Tanner replies.\nThat exchange is a nice example of the movie\u2019s sly humor, which is grounded in character between the dissimilar brothers as well as the two mismatched Texas Rangers chasing them, Marcus (Jeff Bridges), an old-timer three weeks from an unwanted retirement, and Alberto (Gil Birmingham), his Native American partner, who suffers through insults and gives back as good as he gets.\nThat \u201cHell or High Water\u201d makes you empathize with and understand (though not excuse) each member of this disparate quartet is a tribute to the way Taylor Sheridan\u2019s screenplay works equally well as a thriller, character study and pointed social commentary. Sheridan also wrote last year\u2019s taut white-knuckler \u201cSicario,\u201d which likewise squared its violence with a superb sense of the Southwest and the people who inhabit it.\nDirector David Mackenzie keeps the story moving briskly, striking a nice balance between the jolting robbery sequences and the ruminative conversations between its two pairs of men. Cinematographer Giles Nuttgens\u2019 beautiful widescreen compositions add to the immersive, respectful authenticity, as does Mackenzie\u2019s superb casting that extends to the smallest roles. (The filmmakers have clearly spent their fair share of time in restaurants. The two waitresses in this movie \u2014 played by Katy Mixon (\u201cEastbound and Down\u201d) and Margaret Bowman \u2014 are beauts, each in their own particular fashion.)\nPlaying the lawman, Bridges, looking like Kris Kristofferson from \u201cLone Star,\u201d shines as a plainspoken man grieving the end of his career. Foster and Pine establish a solid connection as siblings from the get-go, with Foster making the most of every big, loose-cannon moment and Pine nicely understated as a man looking to inoculate his sons from the \u201cdisease of poverty\u201d that has infected every generation of his family. That, as the movie\u2019s damaged landscapes make clear, is a tall order. Holding up a bank is child\u2019s play by comparison.\n\u2018Hell or High Water\u2019\nMPAA rating: R for some strong violence, language throughout and brief sexuality.\nRunning time: 1 hour, 42 minutes\nPlaying: In limited release"

      "text": "- Share via\nWhen she agreed to play Pamela Anderson, Lily James expected she\u2019d eventually receive the \u201cBaywatch\u201d star\u2019s blessing.\n\u201cPam & Tommy\u201d was, after all, about consent \u2014 an exploration of the disturbing privacy violation Anderson and her then-husband, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce drummer Tommy Lee, suffered when their sex tape was stolen in 1995 and subsequently distributed online.\nBut as the start of production on the Hulu series approached last spring, inquiries to Anderson remained unanswered. Not only did the 54-year-old choose not to be involved with the miniseries but she apparently opposed its existence altogether. Tabloid reports, citing sources close to the actor, claimed she found the series \u201cvery painful,\u201d calling it a \u201ccheap knockoff\u201d she\u2019d never watch. A month into production, Courtney Love said on Facebook that the tape had \u201cdestroyed my friend Pamela\u2019s life,\u201d arguing the show was \u201cfurther causing her complex trauma.\u201d\n\u201cAnd shame on lily James,\u201d Love added, \u201cwhoever the f\u2014 she is.\u201d\nDevastated: That\u2019s who James now was. The 32-year-old had spent the better part of a year transforming into the former Playmate, only to be left wondering: By making a TV program about how Anderson was exploited, was James simply adding to the exploitation?\n\u201cI\u2019m really sensitive to it,\u201d she said, trying to rub out a stain from coffee she\u2019d just spilled on her dress. \u201cI just know that my intentions \u2014 our intentions \u2014 were good. I would never have come on board if I didn\u2019t think it was a worthy story to look at in order to provoke a conversation about how we treat women.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a thorny topic \u2014 one she continues to grapple with. Five days after our interview, James sent an email saying how much the issues raised in the conversation had \u201cbeen on my mind.\u201d She said she\u2019d only learned that Anderson wouldn\u2019t be involved \u201cquite late in the process,\u201d and though she was \u201cincredibly disappointed,\u201d she\u2019d channeled her feelings into a heightened sense of \u201cresponsibility to do absolutely everything I could to try and do her justice.\u201d\nIt\u2019s cast a shadow over what is otherwise the biggest moment in James\u2019 career to date. For the past decade, she has largely played amiable, pleasant types: the lead princess in Kenneth\u2019s Branagh\u2019s live-action \u201cCinderella,\u201d the younger version of Meryl Streep in the \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d sequel, the waitress on the run in \u201cBaby Driver.\u201d But though she\u2019s appeared in around 20 films, she\u2019s not uniformly identified with any one performance.\n\u201cPam & Tommy\u201d should change that. As Anderson, James is both sweet and audacious, embodying the wide-eyed, 20-something Canadian who at once relished an invite to the Playboy mansion and fought to make her collaborators on \u201cBaywatch\u201d and the 1996 film \u201cBarb Wire\u201d see her as more than a body to push and prod.\n\u201cThis is a game-changer for Lily,\u201d said Lake Bell, who directed her in two episodes of the series. \u201cI see her ferociousness. She knows how to exercise restraint, and she knows when to release the storm inside. People don\u2019t know that yet about her.\u201d\nJames had been mulling a metamorphosis when she was approached about \u201cPam & Tommy,\u201d which co-stars Sebastian Stan as Lee. She\u2019d recently gone up for a dark, complex character only to be told by the director that she was \u201ctoo likable.\u201d She took it as a sign that she needed to mix things up.\n\u201cI was feeling fed up, like I was repeating myself, or boxed in,\u201d she recalled. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re so likable\u2019 is diminishing, in some way. That\u2019s not a compliment.\u201d\nJames, who was raised in Surrey, England, about an hour from the home she recently bought in north London, was a prototypical theater kid. At her performing arts high school, she wrote out all the lyrics to the songs while watching \u201cGrease\u201d and had a Marilyn Monroe boxed set. After graduating, she studied at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, whose alumni include Michaela Coel, Daniel Craig and Jodie Whittaker.\nActing was also in her blood. Her grandmother, Helen Horton, was an American-born actor who voiced the \u201cMother\u201d ship computer in Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cAlien.\u201d Her father, Jamie Thomson \u2014 who died from cancer in 2008 \u2014 was a performer too. In the 1970s, he lived on Sunset Boulevard and made ends meet as a waiter. After a car accident left his face scarred, he found a new niche as a character actor playing gangsters.\n\u201cMy dad was such an artist \u2014 I barely ever heard him speak in his voice. It was always accents, always stories, always songs,\u201d James said. \u201cHe was a clown, though. I\u2019m less of a clown. I really want to do a comedy. My dad was freakin\u2019 hilarious. I\u2019m only funny by accident. I feel like when I watch movies I\u2019m in, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, they cut my joke,\u2019 which can\u2019t be a good sign.\u201d\nJames is prone to taking casual jabs at herself like this, and those who have worked with her say she is often her own harshest critic. To prepare for \u201cPam & Tommy,\u201d the actor trained with dialect coach Liz Himelstein for six weeks prior to production. She also requested Himelstein\u2019s presence on-set, and the two would run lines and do tongue twisters or consonant drills in James\u2019 trailer while she was having her hair and makeup done.\n\u201cShe was very hard on herself,\u201d said Himelstein. \u201cShe would say a line and then say, \u2018Oh, that doesn\u2019t sound right.\u2019 I said, \u2018It actually does.\u2019 And she\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, I need it again.\u2019 I said, \u2018Fine, let\u2019s do it again.\u2019 But I\u2019d tell her: \u2018Oh, my God. My darling, you are nailing it.\u2019\u201d\nJames spent hours watching every interview she could find with Anderson on YouTube, notating her pace, tone and inflection. Then on her iPhone, James recorded herself mimicking the interviews and saved the files for reference.\n\u201cSo like this one,\u201d she said, hitting play on one of the clips, \u201cit\u2019s Pam\u2019s main note. I would use these to find her pitch on the piano.\u201d\nDuring the four months that \u201cPam & Tommy\u201d filmed, James went full Lady Gaga, speaking only in Anderson\u2019s Malibu-influenced cadence. (\u201cExcept when I would get a little drunk. That\u2019s when it was like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s what I sound like. Back to my extremely dry sense of English humor.\u2019\u201d)\nReframing of the couple\u2019s sex tape saga has mixed results, but the series\u2019 treatment of culture at the dawn of the internet is stupidly entertaining.\nIn person, James bears little physical resemblance to Anderson. She\u2019s a brunet with a slight frame who rarely tousles her hair or wears heavy eyeliner. So while she spent six months working out with a personal trainer before sporting the blond\u2019s iconic red swimsuit, much of James\u2019 physical transformation was aided by prosthetics. She was cast without having to do a screen test, and the first time production tried out different looks on her, it didn\u2019t go well.\n\u201cI looked Italian,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI was panicking, like, \u2018I can\u2019t do this.\u2019 I looked nothing like Pamela Anderson.\u201d\nWhen the team nixed a cheap blond wig and stopped shaving James\u2019 eyebrows, she recalled, things started to improve. She wore two prosthetics on her face, but the majority of the Anderson effect was achieved through makeup: shaving down her nose, using contour and shadow to make her cheeks look fuller, adding liner to plump up her lips. To complete the transformation, she wore long fake nails, colored contacts, fake teeth and a chest prosthetic. She also bleached her eyebrows and got weekly spray tans for the entirety of shooting.\nShe found the smoke and mirrors to be both a support and a hindrance.\n\u201cSometimes it felt like this amazing armor that you could hide [behind] and disappear inside of,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd other times all I could think was: \u2018No, wait, but that doesn\u2019t sound like her.\u2019\u201d\nJames also felt conflicted about watching the sex tape \u2014 less explicit parts of which are emulated in \u201cPam & Tommy.\u201d Asked if she\u2019d viewed the tape in her research, James demurred.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to say \u2014 it just makes me feel really uncomfortable because it\u2019s a really difficult subject to talk about because of the damage it caused to their lives,\u201d she said. \u201cThe show does so well at exploring the problems and consequences and repercussions of it, so in a way I want the show to explore that rather than me giving any answers that become tricky and uncomfortable.\u201d (Craig Gillespie, a director and executive producer on the project, clarified that after extensive conversations with James, the team decided only to pull from the tape on an \u201cemotional level\u201d and not use it to guide \u201canything sexual\u201d in the series\u2019 depiction of Anderson and Lee.)\nJames said she gained the deepest understanding of Anderson through reading her 2015 book of poetry, \u201cRaw,\u201d and letters she wrote in support of animal rights. She also related to the ways Anderson was \u201cminimized and patronized\u201d because of her gender and sexuality.\nAs \u201cPam & Tommy\u201d emphasizes, the dissemination of the sex tape was far more damaging to Anderson\u2019s reputation than to Lee\u2019s. Because Anderson had posed nude in Playboy and wore a bathing suit on television, the tape was used to further characterize her as a sexpot without substance or ambition. Lee, meanwhile, was applauded for his large genitalia and further idolized as a womanizing rock \u2019n\u2019 roller.\nJames herself has faced public scandal in her personal life. In October 2020, the Daily Mail published paparazzi photos of her and married actor Dominic West, her co-star in the Amazon series \u201cThe Pursuit of Love,\u201d intimately embracing in Rome. Days later, West kissed his wife in front of photographers outside his home in London. \u201cOur marriage is strong and we\u2019re very much still together,\u201d read a note the couple tacked to their home.\nAt the time, James said nothing about the incident, and she still isn\u2019t ready to talk about it more than a year later. Asked if she felt she\u2019d been slut-shamed by the media in ways similar to Anderson, she tried to avoid any allusions to herself.\n\u201cI just feel that, sadly, this question and this conversation is ongoing, because it happens to women all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many women in the public arena who don\u2019t feel like their privacy has been violated. And so that was something I really wanted to look at, because it\u2019s incredibly damaging.\u201d\nSo did she take on \u201cPam & Tommy\u201d in an attempt to explore the issue?\n\u201cNo, I signed onto this two years ago,\u201d she clarified. \u201cI worry about not articulating myself properly \u2014 especially when things get written down and that\u2019s your statement to the world. I would much rather explore what I feel through my work. Like, even now, we\u2019re talking about my private life when I really want to be talking about work and in a way, that\u2019s what we\u2019re exploring in the show.\u201d\nWithout going into detail, Bell said that she and James \u2014 \u201clike most women in our industry\u201d \u2014 connected through discussions of the \u201ctheft in female image, bodies, and sense of safety and comfort.\u201d In 2014, Bell had nude images of herself stolen and distributed as part of a large-scale celebrity hacking effortreferred to as the Fappening.\nTo accompany the premiere of Hulu\u2019s \u2018Pam & Tommy,\u2019 we\u2019ve compiled a timeline of key developments in the saga, with Times coverage.\n\u201cComing into this story, one of the first things I said was that I felt almost like I was being triggered,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom one perspective, you could say that the creators of this show are cis, white males, but in the same breath understand that there were strong creative forces who were women who\u2019d been through very similar situations. And we had a responsibility not to exploit Pam once again.\u201d\nBell said she and James have a potential collaboration in the works, and the actor said she\u2019s eager to produce more of her own work in the future. She admires performers like Helena Bonham Carter and Amy Adams, who do not display a particular allegiance to any genre. In college, James said, one of her favorite teachers drummed into her head that \u201crepetition is the death of creativity.\u201d The instructor was so insistent upon the lesson that students were never allowed to sit in the same seat twice.\n\u201cI never want to rely on certain attributes or characters that feel as if they come more easily to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI am happy with the roles I\u2019ve played to date, but I just want to keep going to the opposite ends of the scale now. I\u2019m hooked.\u201d\nShe\u2019s also committed to taking care of herself offscreen. Last year, she began meditating and seeing a therapist and a shamanic healer, with whom she consults over Zoom.\nOne of her main goals was to work on \u201cswitching [her] head off,\u201d quieting the voice offering constant criticism. She\u2019s looking for things to root her in a profession where she often feels unmoored \u2014 playing someone else, growing close to new people only to leave them, living in a strange place, not seeing friends or family.\nThat\u2019s part of why talking about Anderson feels so tender. She wouldn\u2019t ever want to betray someone who now feels like a part of her.\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange and surreal to have spent so long studying and learning from someone and never having met them. I want to be thoughtful and sensitive always,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, I\u2019d much rather talk about difficult, nuanced issues in relation to and through my work. That is how I want to express myself.\u201d"

Her book \u201cTom Cruise: Anatomy of an Actor\u201d was printed by Cahiers du Cinema/Phaidon Press, and her second, \u201cExtra Girls,\u201d will be published by Simon & Schuster. Nicholson also co-hosts the movie podcast \u201cUnspooled.\u201d\n- Share via\n1\n\u201cLurker\u201d is a teeth-grittingly great dramedy that insists there\u2019s more tension in the entourage of a mellow hipster than a king. At least imperial courtiers trust in strict codes about curtsies and proper titles. The rules of hanging out with British-born, L.A.-based emo-pop musician Oliver (Archie Madekwe) are vague and fraught. An impulsive, baby-faced charmer on the ascent from Instagram popularity to mainstream icon, Oliver isn\u2019t that rich or that famous (yet), but he\u2019s already surrounded by friends-slash-employees who ferociously guard his fiefdom and their access to it. Oliver thrives on vibes, bro, and these ones are cutthroat.\nFirst-time feature filmmaker Alex Russell brings us into this demi-star\u2019s orbit through a Melrose streetwear sales clerk named Matthew (Th\u00e9odore Pellerin). The gawky kid is an Oliver obsessive. But he\u2019s clever enough to hide it, negging his hero into giving him a backstage pass. (Here, it\u2019s an insult to be called a fan.) Upon entering the green room, Matthew is hazed by Oliver\u2019s buddies Swett and Bowen (Zack Fox and Wale Onayemi, both inscrutable, funny and terrifying), who order the nervous outsider to pull down his pants as a tribute to their dead homie. He passes that test. There will be more to come.\n- Share via\nRussell sharpened his knives as a writer and producer on \u201cThe Bear\u201d and \u201cBeef.\u201d He makes bleak comedies about strivers with shiv-like gags that make you wheeze in pain. Advised to make himself useful, Matthew quickly gets promoted from Oliver\u2019s unofficial dishwasher to his unofficial documentary director. Just as quickly, he makes enemies with Oliver\u2019s somewhat more official music video director, Noah (Daniel Zolghadri), who attempts to give Matthew the royal brush-off, as in \u201cWe appreciate your help, but ...\u201d and then patronizingly calls him his \u201csous-chef.\u201d\nAs Matthew learns when his pal, Jamie (Sunny Suljic), finagles his own party invite, anyone who gets their claws in Oliver attacks their rivals. \u201cLurker\u201d is too passive a title for this story of competition. \u201cClinger\u201d or \u201cLeecher\u201d would be more apropos.\nWe came to Park City, Utah, with huge appetites for the 41st annual Sundance Film Festival. But we\u2019re trimming down our top picks to the very best of the best.\nOliver presents as all sunny, breezy love, sporting a trucker cap over a babushka over bleached pink hair. The costume designer Megan Gray outfits the 6\u20195\u201d Madekwe in floppy sweaters that exaggerate his eagerness to pull people in for a long-limbed hug. Flighty and magnetic, Oliver trills that his clique is \u201cone big happy family,\u201d using his faux-obliviousness to shield himself from being the bad guy. That responsibility lands on everyone else, especially the observant and exhausted Shai (Havana Rose Liu), who might be called Oliver\u2019s manager if anyone had a formal job description.\nMadekwe played a more obviously cruel gatekeeper in \u201cSaltburn\u201d as Jacob Elordi\u2019s snotty American cousin, but he still holds all the keys. In scenes where Madekwe shuts off his character\u2019s warmth, the movie gets 30 degrees colder (and his artificial pep more chilling). Meanwhile, Pellerin\u2019s flinchy smiles and forced guffaws prove how much effort it takes to act effortless. At his most nonchalant, he\u2019s doing an Oliver impression.\n\u201cLurker\u201d has a casual malevolence, Russell sidling up to his targets before he attacks. He stress-tests our icky, grubby pity for Matthew and, beyond that, the flimsiness of modern fame culture and its fake-it-till-you-make-it inspirational platitudes. In a hilarious bit, one of Matthew\u2019s own fans stops him on the street to gush, \u201cI wanna be like you \u2014 but what do you do?\u201d\nWhat Russell really seems to be wondering is what separates a real artist from a fake? If \u201cLurker\u201d had been made a generation ago, it would have drawn a line along the boundary of authenticity: Is Oliver sincere about his vulnerable anthems? Today, that question is pass\u00e9. We now recognize the pressure to forge a brand, even if said brand is a pretense of not caring about one\u2019s image.\nAt this point in his career, Oliver likes framing himself as giddy, low-fi and spontaneous. He loves videos of himself crashing his bike into a trash can, frolicking on a beach, prancing around a field with a retro camcorder strapped to a sheep. \u201cAm I tripping or is this sick?\u201d Oliver asks about the farm footage. Since his posse won\u2019t admit the truth, I will: It sucks.\nWe\u2019ve mapped out 27 of the best movie theaters in L.A., from the TCL Chinese and the New Beverly to the Alamo Drafthouse and which AMC reigns in Burbank.\nOliver\u2019s charisma is its own trap. A crib of yes-men limits how big he can grow. The film\u2019s image-first focus doesn\u2019t give it much runway to explore what motivates Oliver as an artist. There are several performance scenes that showcase Madekwe\u2019s ability to croon in a convincing limber lilt but little engagement with his actual music. You sense that Russell is more confident dissecting the qualities of a good steak sandwich than a good song.\nMy impression of the tunes is that Kenny Beats (who had a hand in all of them and also the brilliantly anxious electronic score) has written the bulk to be decent but not dynamite. How a singer vaults up in quality is as mysterious as trying to define cool itself. Only toward the end of the film does Russell tease the question that we, too, have forgotten to ask: Does anyone care whether Oliver is a genuine talent?\nDespite its thorny psychology, \u201cLurker\u201d strips its characters of everything but a scrap of backstory. We\u2019re aware that Matthew lives with his grandmother, but we don\u2019t know why and we don\u2019t even know her name. That starkness gives the movie the in-the-moment immediacy of a nature doc about a shark and a swarm of remoras. Russell insists we make our own diagnosis about what drives Matthew and Oliver\u2019s hunger for applause \u2014 and if their symbiotic dynamic has echoes throughout the entire music industry.\nTwice, Russell cues up the R&B classic \u201cI\u2019m Your Puppet,\u201d which is once too many for my taste. We\u2019re already concentrating on who\u2019s pulling the strings. Elsewhere, there are moments when I wish Russell himself didn\u2019t play things quite so casually. He\u2019s so smart about noting the details \u2014 tiny glances, awkward smiles \u2014 that it\u2019s head-scrambling when he obscures a major plot point under hasty editing and cryptic dialogue. It\u2019s a key sequence in the script, yet we can\u2019t get a grip on whether it\u2019s horrific luck or a game of six-dimensional chess. The distinction matters.\nStill, Russell has captured us with this tale of a pawn trying to capture a king. We feel for them both. And we understand why castles have moats.\n'Lurker'\nRated: R, for language throughout and some sexual content\nRunning time: 1 hour, 40 minutes\nPlaying: In limited release Friday"

      "text": "- Share via\n\u201cHoney Don\u2019t!\u201d is a smutty desert mystery in which the detective, Honey O\u2019Donohue (Margaret Qualley), never gets around to solving the central crime. She\u2019s too busy seducing women and swatting down randy men. I\u2019d call the opening murder a red herring except it\u2019s really more like a fish left to cook in the blinding Bakersfield sun.\nThe second film co-written by Ethan Coen and his collaborator and wife Tricia Cooke (the first was 2024\u2019s \u201cDrive-Away Dolls\u201d), it\u2019s less preoccupied by the challenge of who\u2019s responsible for that corpse than by its own overarching question: Why not? Why not let Margaret Qualley prove she has the electricity to power an audience through any plot? Why not pivot from \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d and \u201cO Brother, Where Art Thou?\u201d to an announced trilogy of tatty lesbian exploitation pictures? Why not, when a couple has earned the industry clout to shoot the script they want with the cast they want, make exactly the movie they want, even if this pulpy B-picture isn\u2019t very good? Who\u2019s going to tell them, honey don\u2019t?\n- Share via\nTo be clear, there\u2019s enough to like in \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!\u201d to get you through its 89-minute running time. I\u2019d watch Qualley stride around barking at people for twice as long and her supporting cast, which includes Aubrey Plaza as Honey\u2019s latest lover and Chris Evans as an oily pastor, is delivering at top level, i.e., Coen-worthy. (Newer talent Josh Pafchek pockets his scenes as a moronic Australian brute.) The script has several zingers that are so good you want to applaud right in your seat, particularly an insult Honey slings at her estranged daddy (Kale Browne). Even the extended intro credits have a witty energy that makes you forgive that they\u2019re tap dancing to pad the length.\nStill, as with the sillier \u201cDolls,\u201d which also starred Qualley as a hot-to-trot queer queen, the film is so shaggy that it feels longer than it is. I finished both movies double-checking my watch in astonishment that they really were under an hour and a half.\nThe season looks strong, loaded with the kind of big Hollywood swings, smart indie alternatives and a fair amount of delicious-looking dumb, necessary in every summer diet.\nQualley\u2019s Honey is a headstrong investigator who is so independent, she refuses to let her secretary (Gabby Beans) make her a cup of coffee. Frankly, she\u2019s not that impressive as a private dick. Honey is only passingly curious why a client died before their first meeting and so predominately distracted by tangential side quests \u2014 her troubled teen niece (Talia Ryder), her dalliances with Plaza\u2019s husky lady cop \u2014 that the resolution doesn\u2019t involve much brilliant deduction. We know from the first scene that Honey needs to keep a close eye on a mysterious stranger named Cher (Lera Abova). Ultimately, the French femme fatale catches her attention for other reasons.\nAcross town, the corrupt Reverend Drew (Evans) is swaying his parishioners to sleep with him in the name of godly submission. \u201cI want to see your bosoms jouncing during fellowship,\u201d he commands a member of his flock. The preacher is one of the biggest sinners in Bakersfield, not merely because both he and Honey may as well be using the phone book as a checklist of conquests. A normal thriller would frame their dynamic as cat versus mouse. Here, it\u2019s more like plague and vaccine. Honey is immune to his sales pitches for heterosexuality and holy salvation.\nHoney is a brazenly preposterous creation: a 21st century woman who insists on using a Rolodex, something that was headed toward extinction before Qualley was even born. Striding through brush in seamed stockings and high heels \u2014 and changing wardrobe multiple times a day just because she can \u2014 she\u2019s the only character who never breaks a sweat (except in the bedroom).\nQualley keeps her cool from head to toe: eyebrows stern, line deliveries cucumber-crisp. Like a brassy classic dame, she says exactly what she means. When the local homicide officer, Marty (Charlie Day), makes a pass at her, she bluntly replies, \u201cI like girls.\u201d The guy doesn\u2019t listen \u2014 he just keeps pestering her \u2014 which makes their dynamic play like some sort of clunky runner about how men are dense.\nMarty\u2019s pursuit is that. But Honey\u2019s retort is also how the real-life Cooke shot Coen down the first time her future husband asked her out on a date. More than anything, it\u2019s evidence that \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!\u201d primarily exists as the couple\u2019s own affectionate in-joke. \u201cTricia\u2019s queer and sweet and I\u2019m straight and stupid,\u201d Coen said last year in an interview with the Associated Press. Both describe their three-decades-plus marriage as \u201cnontraditional.\u201d Both also insist that they\u2019re making these pulp flicks as a unit and don\u2019t care who gets credit for what, claiming that Coen is cited as the director of \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!\u201d simply because he\u2019s the one in the DGA.\nWe\u2019ve mapped out 27 of the best movie theaters in L.A., from the TCL Chinese and the New Beverly to the Alamo Drafthouse and which AMC reigns in Burbank.\nCoen is, of course, half of another twosome with his brother Joel that also enjoys defying labels. Their filmography zigzags between thrillers and comedies, lean exercises and awards heavyweights, never making the same movie twice. It\u2019s as though their guiding compass is to stay ahead of audience expectations. The pair has been on a creative break since 2018\u2019s \u201cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs\u201d and it\u2019s been tempting to use their separate projects as an opportunity to examine who each sibling is as an individual. If you watched Joel Coen\u2019s black-and-white \u201cThe Tragedy of Macbeth\u201d in a double feature with \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!\u201d you\u2019d leave convinced that the elder Joel was the stylist and the younger Ethan the wit \u2014 that Joel wears a monocle and Ethan a grease-painted John Waters mustache.\nBut they might just be tricking us again. It\u2019s just as valid to say the brains behind those two movies are William Shakespeare and Tricia Cooke, especially the latter as she seems to have had the stronger hand in shaping the two sexy Qualley capers we\u2019ve seen thus far. (The third already has a title: \u201cGo Beavers.\u201d)\nAs sloppy as it is, there\u2019s no denying that \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!\u201d works as a noir with a pleasant, peppery flavor. Yet, there\u2019s a snap missing in its rhythm, a sense that it doesn\u2019t know when and how its gags should hit. When a playboy (Christian Antidormi) swaggers up to a bar and orders a shot of cinnamon schnapps, the line clangs like it landed better on the page. A few scenes later, a low-level drug dealer goes home to his Bolivian grandmother (Gloria Sandoval) who is such a caricature \u2014 bowler hat, lap full of dried chile peppers \u2014 that you suspect the character was designed to get more of a laugh. I did giggle when Honey visited her sister, a worn-out hausfrau named Heidi (Kristen Connolly), and kids kept popping out of the corners of her home one after another like rabbits from a hat.\nThe majority of the townsfolk that Honey encounters are such incurious mouth-breathers that the humor can feel hostile. The film\u2019s worldview is that most people are, as Coen describes himself, straight and stupid. That\u2019s worked out well enough for him. He\u2019s won four Oscars and, more importantly, the ability to do whatever he darned well pleases.\n'Honey Don't!'\nRated: R, for strong sexual content, graphic nudity, some strong violence, and language\nRunning time: 1 hour, 29 minutes\nPlaying: In wide release Friday, Aug. 22"

      "text": "Those paranoid feelings are back\n- Share via\nThroughout the 1970s, a growing fear gnawed at the hearts and uneasy minds of Americans, the suspicion that no one could be trusted -- not big business, not authority figures, not society in general. Especially not the government. And filmmakers -- both emerging and established -- often brilliantly captured the turbulent decade\u2019s paranoia.\nFor the next month, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art\u2019s film department is spotlighting the \u201cParanoia Films of the \u201870s.\u201d The festival opens Friday with Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s landmark 1974 thriller \u201cThe Conversation,\u201d starring Gene Hackman as a secretive San Francisco surveillance expert who believes a young couple he was hired to spy on will be murdered; and Arthur Penn\u2019s 1975 mystery thriller \u201cNight Moves,\u201d with Hackman as a former football player and private eye hired on what he believes is a standard missing-person case.\nOther films included in the retrospective are 1974\u2019s \u201cThe Parallax View,\u201d directed by Alan J. Pakula and starring Warren Beatty; Roman Polanski\u2019s 1976 thriller \u201cThe Tenant\u201d; Sydney Pollack\u2019s 1975 chiller \u201cThree Days of the Condor,\u201d with Robert Redford; Steven Spielberg\u2019s classic 1971 TV movie \u201cDuel\u201d; Martin Scorsese\u2019s expressionistic 1976 drama \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d; and Sam Peckinpah\u2019s 1971 revenge drama \u201cStraw Dogs,\u201d with Dustin Hoffman.\nChris Horak, curator of the Hollywood Entertainment Museum, traces the paranoia of the \u201870s to a convergence of factors in the previous decade. \u201cIt was more than just the John F. Kennedy assassination,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was more than Vietnam and more than just the civil rights movement, which you have to take into consideration. During the civil rights movement, a lot of Americans saw government, state governments, breaking the law\u201d and acting on agendas that ignored the best interests of the people. \u201cIt was shocking.\u201d\nExtending boundaries\nAlso coming into play was the demise of the Hays Production Code, which had censored Hollywood since the 1930. By 1966, it was basically defunct, and veteran filmmakers found themselves in competition with a freewheeling new group of directors, including Coppola, Scorsese and Spielberg, who were willing and eager to expand the boundaries of film.\n\u201cThe filmmakers who are making the films in the series are either complete Hollywood outsiders, like Spielberg, or came from television or had been in the lower level of \u2018B\u2019 films, like Peckinpah, but by the late \u201860s and early \u201870s were coming into the fore,\u201d says Horak.\n\u201cThis new generation is much more willing to question authority not only in the public form but also how films are to be made -- the films don\u2019t conform to a classical Hollywood narrative in the same way.\u201d\nAnd the actors who starred in these films -- Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Hoffman -- didn\u2019t look like classic matinee idols. \u201cIt was an era where the actors became a lot more like ordinary-looking people,\u201d says LACMA film curator Ian Birnie. \u201cTheir own physical appearance and their interest in way-out psychology made it possible to create these kind of characters.\u201d\nThough some of the protagonists in these paranoia films were decent guys who found themselves embroiled in some conspiracy, like Redford in \u201cCondor\u201d and Beatty in \u201cParallax View,\u201d most were more like Hackman\u2019s dark and unsympathetic Harry Caul in \u201cThe Conversation.\u201d\n\u201cHe is not nominally somebody who would be the hero of a film,\u201d says Oscar winner Walter Murch, who edited \u201cThe Conversation\u201d as well as created the thriller\u2019s landmark sound design. \u201cThat is precisely what Francis was interested in -- taking somebody who in a normal murder mystery would have a tangential role and switching lenses and looking at this character exclusively.\u201d\nWhen a film is about an unusual person who has an unusual occupation, says Murch, \u201cand it is told completely from their point of view, you begin, if you stick with the film, to see and in this case hear the world the way this person hears it. Because this person is a professional sound person you begin to become one too. I think that is why people pick up that the sound is so important and critical in the film.\u201d\nThese films, says Birnie, \u201ckind of mark the beginning of our modern world. Our lives kind of got divided into two: Our childhood was lived in a kind of world that wasn\u2019t that much different from \u2018Meet Me in St. Louis\u2019 and our adulthood was totally different.\u201d\n*\n(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)\nParanoia Films of the \u201870s\nWhere: Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Leo S.
