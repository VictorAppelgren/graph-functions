The piece also offers practical tips—such as shuffling, avoiding obvious groupings, and breaking down long words—to help players navigate the game’s tricky purple category. Additionally, it briefly touches on Wordle strategy and letter frequency data, but the main focus remains on Connections gameplay and its new AI‑powered features.",
