      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid first pass but needs tightening to meet the “world‑class” standard. 1) **Format** – the swing‑trade line must follow the exact template:  \n`Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100`.  Replace the current “Long | 3–6 months | 31.00 …” line with a single, correctly‑spaced line. 2) **Causal chain** – explicitly link the Ultra C wb ramp → revenue to the upper end of the $850‑$950 M guidance → 37.1 % earnings growth → 14 % upside to $36.50. 3) **Probabilities** – derive each % from concrete evidence: e.g., Q3 earnings beat probability ≈ 70 % (SK994CBWR), Fed rate‑cut probability ≈ 60 % (Powell comments, SK994CBWR), Ultra C wb ramp success ≈ 80 % (patent‑pending tech, SK994CBWR).  Combine these to a weighted upside probability of ~ 45 % rather than the inflated 60 %.  4) **Risk triggers** – list all invalidation events with dates: Fed hike (Oct 2025 meeting, SK994CBWR), China export‑control tightening (Q4 2025, SK994CBWR), supply‑chain bottlenecks (ongoing, SK994CBWR), CPI revision below 2.5 % (LZG5YWQMC).  5) **Numbers** – include the current price ($30.53), target ($36.50), stop ($29.50), R/R (3.7), and base‑case valuation ($34.76).  6) **Confidence** – reduce to 60 % (given the multiple upside drivers) and justify with the 14 % upside and 49.4 % gross margin.  7) **Citations** – attach IDs only when stating facts or numbers (e.g., “$850‑$950 M guidance (SK994CBWR)”, “CPI 2.7 % (LZG5YWQMC)”).  8) **Remove extraneous content** – drop unrelated geopolitical and energy sections; focus solely on ACMR’s fundamentals and macro tailwinds.  After these edits, the analysis will be concise, evidence‑driven, and fully compliant with the required format.",
