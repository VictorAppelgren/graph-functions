  "content": "President Donald Trump said Sunday that he would send the National Guard to Baltimore to \"quickly clean up the crime\" if Maryland Gov. Wes Moore says he need help.Moore had earlier invited Trump to attend a public safety walk in the crime-ridden city in September, saying in an Aug. 21 letter that the event would provide an opportunity to \"discuss strategies for effective public safety policy.\"TRUMP VOWS TO MAKE DC 'SAFER' AND 'BEAUTIFUL' AS CAPITAL BATTLES CRIME AND HOMELESSNESS\"As President, I would much prefer that he clean up this crime disaster before I go there for a walk,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. He accused Moore of having a poor record on crime \"unless he fudges his figures on crime like many of the other Blue States are doing.\"Trump added that he did not appreciate the tone of Moore\u2019s invitation.CHICAGO MAYOR CALLS TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT PLAN 'UNCOORDINATED, UNCALLED-FOR AND UNSOUND'\"But if Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum did in L.A., I will send in the \"troops,\" which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the crime,\" Trump wrote. He added that Baltimore ranks among the worst cities in the United States for crime and murder.Earlier this month, the Trump administration rolled out a plan aimed at making Washington, D.C., \"safer and more beautiful\" as his administration doubles down on efforts to address crime and a growing homeless population in the nation\u2019s capital. \"I will take care of our cherished Capital, and we will make it, truly, GREAT AGAIN! Before the tents, squalor, filth, and crime, it was the most beautiful Capital in the world. It will soon be that again,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Aug. 10. BLUE CITIES IN TRUMP\u2019S CROSSHAIRS AFTER DC POLICE TAKEOVERTrump has repeatedly characterized Washington, D.C., as \"one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world.\" Officials have sought to curb crime by deploying hundreds of federal agents and National Guard troops to patrol the streets.On Friday, Trump said he was considering sending the National Guard to Chicago, calling the Windy City \"a mess.\"Trump said that his administration will \"straighten that one out probably next,\" adding that \"it won\u2019t even be tough.\" The White House has not offered additional details of a potential deployment of troops to Chicago.",

      "text": "As President Donald Trump looks to crack down on crime within Washington, D.C., by sending in federal law enforcement to patrol the city, data reveals the nation\u2019s capital is plagued by violent crime when compared to other metropolitan areas around the country.\nThe crackdown comes as the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) is asking for the public's help in identifying a suspect involved in a stabbing on Aug. 7, according to police.\nThe incident occurred as the suspect and victim became involved in a physical altercation in the 1100 block of 7th Street, Northwest, authorities said. During the fight, the suspect allegedly stabbed the victim before fleeing the scene.\nThe victim was subsequently transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\nTRUMP'S FEDERAL CRIME OPERATION BRINGS 100 ARRESTS, 800 NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO WASHINGTON\nIn a news conference Monday, Trump announced he is planning to deploy members of the National Guard to the city\u2019s streets while taking control of the MPD in an effort to restore safety and combat violence.\n\"You can be anything you want, but you want to have safety in the streets,\" Trump said. \"You want to be able to leave your apartment or your house where you live and feel safe and go into a store to buy a newspaper or buy something, and you don\u2019t have that now.\"\nThe move comes as the nation\u2019s capital \"averaged one of the highest robbery and murder rates of large cities nationwide,\" according to an executive order, \"Declaring a Crime Emergency in the District of Columbia.\"\n\"Indeed, the District of Columbia now has a higher violent crime, murder, and robbery rate than all 50 states, recording a homicide rate in 2024 of 27.54 per 100,000 residents,\" the order states.\nTRUMP CLAIMS DC CRIMES TROUNCE STATS FROM NOTORIOUSLY VIOLENT CITIES WORLDWIDE\nIn 2024, Washington D.C. placed fourth among 24 of the nation\u2019s cities when comparing homicide rates per 100,000 citizens, according to a report conducted by the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).\n\"The recent increase of federal law enforcement officers across Washington, D.C., has already stopped vicious criminals, the distribution of deadly narcotics and the violent use of stolen handguns,\" a White House spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\"President Trump\u2019s bold leadership and decisive action will make our nation\u2019s capital beautiful and safe again for its residents and visitors from all the world. The president\u2019s efforts to crack down on crime is an incredibly popular policy that everyday Americans support.\"\nSt. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit accounted for more homicides per capita, the study reported.\nWhen compared to other major metropolitan cities, Washington D.C.\u2019s homicide rate remained exceptionally high when placed alongside New York City\u2019s rate of and Los Angeles\u2019 rate, according to RIT.\nMPD did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\nWhile Trump's ability to utilize the MPD is unique to the nation's capital, federal law enforcement could integrate into other cities with high crime rates utilizing consent decrees, according to former NYPD Lt. Darrin Porcher.\n\"That's when the federal government comes in, and they review a police department,\" Porcher told Fox News Digital. \"And they'll make a series of recommendations based on what the police department is not doing.\"\nI SUPPORT TRUMP TAKING CONTROL OF DC POLICE \u2014 THE CONSTITUTION IS ON HIS SIDE\nPorcher pointed to the ability of federal law enforcement to collaborate with local authorities in crime-ridden cities in an effort to reform a department's response to violence.\n\"A lot of task force activity would be the key component,\" Porcher said. \"So, what the feds can do is send a series of FBI, DEA or ATF agents to a particular city, and they would be a part of a task force that works with the localized police departments. The resources would bridge together from both the city and the federal government to target the excessive crimes that are being committed in that particular area, whether it's homicides, robberies, burglaries.\"\nTRUMP ACTIVATES NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO ADDRESS \u2018TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL\u2019 CRIME IN WASHINGTON\nWATCH: The president was clear we must stand behind our police officers, DEA administrator says\nDespite the higher-than-average rates, the homicide rate within Washington, D.C., dropped 35% when compared to 2023, marking the lowest violent crime rates the city has seen in 30 years, according to the Department of Justice.\n\"In addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides are down 32%,\" the DOJ said in a news release. \"Robberies are down 39%; armed carjackings are down 53%; assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 27% when compared with 2023 levels, with the District reporting the fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\"\nHowever, residents within the nation\u2019s capital insist the move by the Trump administration is a step in the right direction.\nTRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS\u2014BUT SOME WELCOME IT\n\"This is something I think that's been long overdue,\" Jenn Pellegrino, chief spokesperson of America First Policy Institute, told Fox News Digital. \"If you walk around our nation's capital, which sees over 20 million visitors from all around the world every year, this is a lot of people's first impression of what the United States of America is like.\"\nPellegrino has been living in Washington, D.C., for 15 years and has become disheartened by the state of the city she calls home.\n\"While the left is saying that there's nothing to see here, that the White House is overreacting to this situation, it's about how people feel,\" Pellegrino said. \"They can say that the crime stats are down, which some are, but some are rising, like carjacking. People don't feel safe, and something needs to be done to address that.\"\nWASHINGTON, DC, IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CAPITALS OF MANY THIRD-WORLD COUNTRIES, SENATOR SAYS\nAlthough instances of violent crime within Washington, D.C. are down when compared to 2023, reports of incidents involving property remain either relatively stagnant or trending upward.\n\"I think that there is a significant need for crime reduction in a lot of these large cities, such as Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C.,\" Porcher said.\nIn 2025, property crime within the city is down by 4%, according to the MPD. Additionally, there have already been 2,926 reports of motor vehicle theft logged this year, approaching last year's total of 2,940.\n\"It's time to get tough on some of the smaller crimes to prevent the more violent crimes that have been going on in the city,\" Pellegrino said. \"Because, honestly, if you walk around D.C., even in the middle of the daytime [or] a weekday, you\u2019ve got to have your head on a swivel.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nPellegrino hopes the Trump administration\u2019s efforts will set a standard for other cities grappling with crime throughout the country, while ensuring the nation\u2019s capital is a safe place to visit, live and work.\n\"These violent crimes can happen to anybody,\" Pellegrino told Fox News Digital. \"They don't discriminate based on your politics. And, again, whether you're a tourist coming to visit or you're somebody that's lived here, or you just work in the city, we deserve better than that. This is the United States of America. It's the greatest country on Earth. Our nation's capital should represent something better than the standard it's been held to over the last several years.\""
