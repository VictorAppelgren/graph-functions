  "title": "10 Cool Movies Set Entirely on a Computer Screen",
  "description": "For those glued to their screens, these are the best films based entirely within an operating system.",
  "content": "Computer operating systems have become so commonplace that they\u2019re now the latest destination in movie settings. The sub-genre known as screenlife takes place entirely in a computer environment, where app windows and social media messages are the set dressing. It\u2019s a realm we occupy most, so it\u2019s natural to see these digital environments reflected on the big screen.\n\nWith the prevalence of this new subgenre, there are many angles to explore. This relatively new means of telling stories can evoke science fiction, horror, mystery, and even touching drama. For those glued to their screens, these are the best films based entirely within an operating system.\n\nVideo streaming on the go becomes the format for the social media horror of Spree. Kurt Kunkle is a social media star who is fading fast as he becomes desperate for views amid his rideshare job that he records for his channel. Jealous of the success of others, Kurt proceeds to murder others for attention in hopes of being a killer viral celebrity.\n\nSpree dabbles in satirizing online streaming that consumes those who want the most subscribers. Framed entirely through smartphones and computer desktops, the constant need to record everything makes this staging believable and terrifying. The film even manages to be funny amid its internet obsession, where Kurt\u2019s lifestyle leads to several dead ends, and even those who want to get away from it still find themselves enticed by the digital spotlight.\n\nShare begins with a man awakening in a prison cell with nothing. His only connection to the world is through his computer, which connects everybody in this dystopian world. It\u2019s also the only way to survive, where entertainment on the screen is the only way to keep alive in real life.\n\nStaying true to the claustrophobic setting, Share never leaves the trapped room of the unfortunate protagonist, where his contacts are made through picture-in-picture windows. The relatable dystopian angle is astutely explored to highlight how employment has grown so terrible that many resort to online content creation to eat. Director Ira Rosensweig has crafted a film that combines the chilling isolation of The Platform, the desperation of Squid Game, and the real-life terror of online streaming.\n\nFor what sounds like a pun made by The Cryptkeeper, Livescreamers is a screenlife horror that takes aim at video game content creators. The most popular streamers of this format assemble to stream a multiplayer game that turns out to be haunted. With the game killing them in reality, the streamers are forced to work together before this video game becomes their last.\n\nLivescreamers comes off as more genuine thanks to director Michelle Iannantuono's experience as a streaming gamer. He draws from not only the mechanics of this profession but also the mentality that comes with making money in online spaces. While this isn\u2019t the first film to adopt the familiar scenario of \u201cyou die in the game, you die for real,\u201d it taps more into the streaming culture that surrounds video games to stage a more competent horror picture.\n\nFandom takes a dark route in Open Windows, when the obsessed fan Nick (Elijah Wood) gets a chance to meet his favorite actress, Jill (Sasha Grey). But when the contest for this meeting is canceled, he\u2019s given the opportunity to hack into her computer and phone through her campaign manager. With a chance to ruin Jill\u2019s life, Nick proceeds down a dark path beyond cyberstalking.\n\nOpen Windows is the most twisty screenlife movie, considering the layers of impersonation and the constant camera pulling back to reveal several monitoring applications. There\u2019s a constant level of paranoia parading through every scene that makes the stalking fan scenario far more strange and uncomfortable. Director Nacho Vigalondo toys with the concept of screenlife films fairly, considering how early the sub-genre started.\n\nAs the sequel to Unfriended, another screenlife film, Dark Web was more fascinating for its exploration of the internet\u2019s darkest corners. Six friends happened upon a laptop that contained disturbing videos. But they get in too deep when a mysterious strangers messages them not to disconnect or call the police, as they\u2019re forced to take part in a cruel game of death.\n\nWhile Unfriended had its clever moments of horror amid a Skype call, Dark Web makes better use of the screenlife format for all the clever ways the victims are tortured. At one point, a deepfake is used to convince the police that one of the victims is going to assault a shopping mall, leading to a swatting situation with police gunning down the poor user. It\u2019s a film that presents our darkest fears made reality within online spaces where it seems more possible than fantastical.\n\nLove is found online when Jimmy meets Anu through an online dating website. While Jimmy intends to marry this woman, his family is uncertain about this marriage. When Jimmy\u2019s cousin, Kevin, a cybersecurity specialist, goes digging up info on Anu, dark criminal secrets are revealed in this mysterious screenlife thriller.\n\nC U Soon manages to keep pace with an astute audience, especially for being released during the pandemic, where everyone knew the screens they occupied. The story also feels more socially relevant when presenting a scenario concerned with online dating, rumors, and concealed identities. A film like this could fall apart if not for the skillful direction of Mahesh Narayanan, making the movie both technologically astute and expertly acted.\n\nHost takes place amid the COVID-19 pandemic as six friends try to find something fun to do over Zoom. They get involved with a virtual s\u00e9ance that works and summons a demon. Now terrorized by this supernatural force, they must figure out how to defeat this demon or suffer a painful demise amid their Zoom call.\n\nIt was clever to stage a film like Host during lockdown, and the film holds up well enough on its own despite the limitations of filming during a pandemic. With each actor contributing their makeup and stunts to this film, it\u2019s genuinely exciting to see how they come together to bring this horror at home to life. For all the movies and TV shows attempted during the pandemic while we were locked into the digital world, this is one of the most clever and compelling.\n\nIn Missing, June (Storm Reid) is a teenager who hopes for a fun time at home when her mother goes on vacation in Colombia with her new boyfriend. While enjoying having the house to herself, she grows fearful when her mother disappears. Through online profiles and detective work, June tries to figure out what happened to her mom in a twisty conspiracy.\n\nWatching a teenager go from being a social media maven to a cyber sleuth was exciting, proving that the next generation is capable enough with tech. The investigation itself is pretty clever with how much stranger it becomes and how abduction comes into play while keeping the computer screen format. It\u2019s a stellar usage of screenlife that a film seen entirely from a computer desktop can naturally feature kidnappings and stabbings.\n\nDavid Kim (John Cho) experiences every parent\u2019s worst fear when his teenage daughter disappears without a trace. With the police unable to help, David digs into his daughter\u2019s laptop for answers. As he digs through his daughter\u2019s online presence, he slowly peels back the layers of her life for any clues that will reunite him with his daughter.\n\nSearching makes for a compelling investigation, giving the audience the POV of David\u2019s search for the truth. The film solves the problem that often comes with computer research by trying to stage this common practice as dramatic. Given how familiar we\u2019ve become with researching through our interface, being placed in the same seat as David effectively makes us feel his plight while also presenting a densely engaging mystery thriller.\n\nNot all screenlife movies have to be terrifying thrillers or horror, and Language Lessons is a perfect example of how it can be used for meaningful drama. The film centers around a blossoming relationship between Spanish instructor Cari\u00f1o (Natalie Morales) and her student, Adam (Mark Duplass). While Adam is reluctant to take on these lessons he didn\u2019t initially agree to, he becomes more engrossed in learning Spanish when tragedy befalls him.\n\nWith Natalie Morales (Plan B) additionally directing and Mark Duplass (Creep) co-writing, Language Lessons is surprisingly heartfelt for its emotionally moving story conceived during lockdown. The friendship angle is refreshing, and there\u2019s a genuine nature to the performances of Morales and Duplass that comes through surprisingly well for being on different screens. It\u2019s easy to recommend this film as being the best of screenlife movies for highlighting the importance of human connection rather than the darkness of technology we often harp upon.\n\nWhile some of these films were inspired by our reliance on technology during the COVID-19 lockdown, there\u2019s no denying how the digital space has become an environment we occupy most. We\u2019ll likely spend a lot of time in this environment and, given that, we\u2019ll probably see more films like these. Hopefully, there\u2019s more to explore in this sub-genre besides spooky demons in the chat or crimes committed over Zoom.",

From getting things done with keyboard shortcuts to sharing your screen, I\u2019ll give you some useful Zoom tips.\nUse Keyboard Shortcuts to Quickly Access Various Features\nA quick way to get things done in Zoom is to use keyboard shortcuts.

This option streams your webcam feed in HD resolution. Ensure you have a strong enough internet connection to handle this.\nWhy It's Time to Ditch Your Laptop's Camera and Buy a Real Webcam\nCameras in most laptops are average at best; here's why you should upgrade to a dedicated webcam.\nTo make that change, launch Zoom, click your profile icon in the top-right corner, and choose \"Settings.\" From the left sidebar, select \"Video.\" On the right pane, beneath the Camera drop-down menu, turn on the \"HD\" option.\nZoom has automatically saved your change, so you don\u2019t have to click anything.\nBlur or Replace Your Background to Hide Your Cat\nIf you don\u2019t want the meeting audience to see your messy bedroom, you can blur or replace your background. To do that, launch Zoom, click your profile icon in the top-right corner, and choose \"Settings.\"\nHow to Create a Custom Zoom Background\nEven if you have zero Photoshop skills, it's simple to create your own custom Zoom background. Follow along while we do it!\nFrom the left sidebar, select \"Background & Effects.\" On the right pane, in the Virtual Backgrounds section, you\u2019ll see various options. If you want to blur your background, click \"Blur.\" To replace the background with the available images, select an image on the list. To add your own image or video to use as the background, click the plus sign and choose an appropriate option.\nTo change your background in the future, you can return to this screen.\nShare Your Screen to Better Explain Yourself\nIf you want to present something, such as the demo of a product, you can share your screen with Zoom. The app offers multiple ways to perform screen-sharing on your computer.\nTo access that option, while you\u2019re still in a meeting, click \"Share\" in Zoom\u2019s bottom bar. To share your entire screen, on the open window, select your screen in the Entire Screen section. To share a specific app window, in the Application Windows section, choose an app window.

Zoom will convert the recording and save the video file on your computer.\nCan Zoom Hosts Really See All Your Private Messages?\nZoom meeting hosts can't see the private messages you send during meetings... but there are some ways your private messages could leak out. Here's what you need to know.\nCreate Recurring Meetings\nIf you host recurring meetings, you don\u2019t have to create a new meeting every time. Instead, create a recurring meeting with Zoom that occurs at the specified schedule.\nTo do that, open Zoom and click \"Schedule\" on the main interface. On the window that opens, enter your meeting details. This includes your meeting\u2019s name, when the meeting starts and ends, how often the meeting occurs, and so on. After filling in the details, save the meeting by clicking the \"Save\" button.\nYou can use the same meeting link to join this meeting every time.\nEnable Waiting Room to Selectively Admit People in Your Meetings\nIf you want to admit people into your meetings selectively, you can enable the Waiting Room feature. This way, when someone wants to join your meeting, they\u2019ll first enter Waiting Room. After you approve their request to join, they\u2019ll enter the actual meeting.\nWhat Is Zoombombing, and How Can You Stop It?\nAre you using Zoom to video chat with co-workers, family, or friends? Here's how you can protect yourself from \"Zoombombing.\"\nTo do that, launch the Zoom site and sign in to your account. In the left sidebar, click My Account > Settings. On the right pane, at the top, click the \"Meeting\" tab. In this tab, scroll down and turn on the \"Waiting Room\" toggle.\nIn the future, you can turn off the feature by disabling the \"Waiting Room\" toggle.\nAnd that\u2019s how you use various built-in features to make the most of this online conference tool. While you\u2019re at it, consider learning the differences between Zoom and Google Meet."

With our familiarity with the digital, it makes sense that movies reflect the world we live in, where it\u2019s not uncommon to see characters converse over Zoom or perform a Google search for some crucial information.\nBut what about a film seen entirely from the point of view of our computer screens? As it turns out, an entire sub-genre of filmmaking has cropped up in the last decade, reflecting the electronic landscape we mostly inhabit. Screenlife is a type of filmmaking that demonstrates our reliance on technology and how it shapes our world, as much as smartphones and video games. Here, then, we explain the Screenlife genre.\nWhat are Screenlife Movies?\nAs the title implies, screenlife movies depict life entirely through a computer screen. Most, but not all, of these films are set within a Windows or Mac desktop environment. A camera communication app is usually constantly open to reflect the character behind the screen, doing all the mouse clicking and key tapping.\nSome of these movies exist mostly in a browser, featuring many windows and tabs for conference calls, searches, photos, social media, and key information about the plot. The more windows there are, the more tension there is for the camera zooming and panning across information. This is why the sub-genre is best suited for horror and thrillers, where the search for killers and criminals makes sense in a digital environment.\nWhat is Not a Screenlife Movie?\nScreenlife films shouldn\u2019t be confused with movies where there\u2019s a perspective of a computer screen for only a portion of the picture. A good example of this would be a pandemic heist movie, Locked Down, where there are business meetings through Zoom amid the Covid-19 pandemic, but not for the bulk of the story. Even Bo Burnham\u2019s Inside, which features parodies of Twitch and YouTube-style reaction videos, doesn\u2019t meet the sub-genre metric either for having a diverse abundance of perspectives.\nThe distinction must be made between a screenlife film and a film featuring screen-based storytelling. Y2K features an opening on a 1999 computer screen, and while the solution involves using a computer, it doesn\u2019t count for most of the horror-comedy involving running away from computers. The film that never leaves the digitally-generated haven of applications and browsers is what makes a screenlife movie.\nWhat Makes a Good Screenlife Movie?\nThe best screenlife films are the ones that make the most practical use of the computer as a storytelling device. Searching is one of the best examples of this type of film, as it stages a missing person case through software that tracks individuals' whereabouts. It takes scenes of investigating data, which are usually dull or technologically illiterate, and makes them thrilling by letting us examine the evidence alongside the sleuth. It\u2019s a far cry from thrillers that try to hide this aspect or present a generic operating system display that hardly looks real.\nThe forced angle of an operating system means that the director must be astute enough to understand how this technology works. A good screenlife film can wield familiar and believable applications in a way that advances the plot rather than acting as digital fluff between action and dialogue-driven moments. Realizing how our dependence on social media and web applications functions correctly makes it possible for films like Unfriended: Dark Web to toy with the medium and become a horror that isn\u2019t just bleeding hard drives and programs that won\u2019t force quit.\nWhat Makes a Bad Screenlife Movie?\nBecause screenlife movies place the computer desktops front and center, it can be easy to decipher what doesn\u2019t feel right. We use computers daily and can tell when one doesn\u2019t feel right. So if the screenlife\u2019s environment doesn\u2019t feel real, the narrative is about as believable as a hacker randomly mashing their keyboard with green numbers flashing across the screen. Most audiences are smart enough to pick up on what\u2019s not working, and computer experts must be fuming or laughing at the errors.\nA perfect example of a terrible screenlife film is 2025's War of the Worlds, a Prime Video stinker that got loads of press for its near-zero Rotten Tomatoes score. The film depicts the classic sci-fi story from the computer perspective of a DHS agent, played by Ice Cube. It makes many errors in dramatizing the story through a character who doesn\u2019t seem to understand the internet or surveillance, despite that being his job. While the film does include believable websites and services, the forced inclusion of Amazon\u2019s delivery devices saving the day comes off as nothing less than tacky product placement.\nScreenlife movies started as a novel idea, but our familiarity with technology has raised the standards. Once filmmakers become more astute about using everything from Facebook to Zoom, they can craft better, more compelling films that don\u2019t trip over themselves when making computer desktops as a movie setting. Given how absorbed most people have become with their computers and smartphones, this sub-genre will likely take off further, bringing more competition than back-patting for effectively working social media into a plot."

      "text": "While watching a show week-to-week or year-to-year can make you love a show more, the wait can be agonizing. We\u2019ve all been there; you fall in love with a show but must wait until new episodes are released. The wait can be hard, especially if you\u2019re waiting several years for that new season.\nIt\u2019s common for some viewers to wait until a show has finished before bingeing it all at once. If that\u2019s you, then I have a handful of recently finished shows ready for you to watch from beginning to end. So, if you\u2019ve got a weekend free on the couch, these are the recently finished shows to catch up on.\n9 The Conners\n|\nRelease Year |\n2018-2025 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n7 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n112 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nAs a sequel/spin-off to Roseanne, The Conners continues the working-class comedy and drama of the Conner family. Despite Roseanne's death in the show, the household is still packed with too many family members and not enough money to go around. The sitcom still centered around the dramatic and relatable aspects of life amid the pandemic, touching on small businesses, single parenting, and alcoholism.\nThe Conners continued for so long because it embraced what made Roseanne a standout domestic sitcom. It was honest about the world and wasn\u2019t afraid to address the economic and political issues that face working-class families. With familiar characters staying true to this formula, reprised by the talents of John Goodman and Laurie Metcalf, The Conners was more grounded amid family sitcoms that seemed more fantastical with their artificial heart.\n- Subscription with ads\n- Yes, $10/month\n- Live TV\n- Yes, various plans available\nThe Conners is a sitcom centering around a working-class family, continuing from the characters established in Roseanne.\n8 Jellystone!\n|\nRelease Year |\n2021-2025 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n3 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n77 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nFor long-time cartoon fans, Jellystone is a goofy romp of Saturday morning favorites. Various Hanna-Barbera characters assume different jobs, making their town of Jellystone one of boundless fun. This includes Yogi Bear as a doctor, Huckleberry Hound as the mayor, and Quick Draw McGraw as a teacher. Of course, none of them are experts in their professions, leading to many hilarious situations.\nWatching Jellystone evoked nostalgic moments from the Cartoon Network bumpers, when all the cartoon characters interacted with each other. There are plenty of cameos in the show, but the best might be that of Space Ghost and Brak, reprised by voice actors George Lowe and Andy Merril from Space Ghost Coast to Coast. It\u2019s a fun cartoon romp for everybody in the family, especially for the wealth of cartoons covered in the crossover event, Crisis on Infinite Mirths.\n- Subscription with ads\n- Yes, $10/month\n- Simultaneous streams\n- 2 or 4\nJellystone brings back all the classic cartoon characters of Hanna-Barbera for an amusing ensemble of city-bound antics.\n7 Big Mouth\n|\nRelease Year |\n2017-2025 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n8 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n81 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nFew comedies are more awkward and uncomfortable than Big Mouth, an adult animated comedy about puberty. Nick (Nick Kroll) and Jessi (Jessi Klein) are two adolescents struggling to come to terms with their developing bodies. Their feelings manifest as invisible monsters, with Maurice the Hormone Monster (also Kroll) encouraging Nick and Connie the Hormone Monstress (Maya Rudolph) assigned to Jessi.\n10 Great Animated Shows For Adults You Shouldn't Miss\nYou should check out these adult animated shows that might've flown under your radar.\nBig Mouth may be one of the edgiest adult cartoons for its willingness to probe into the absurdity of the human body and sex, embracing all the weird and gross stuff that comes with those elements. The only aspect more strange than the premise is the eclectic voice cast assembled, including the voices of Jordan Peele, Kristen Wiig, Peter Capaldi, and Jeff Goldblum, playing everything from sexual organs to pillows. For its bluntness and silliness, Big Mouth lasted for several seasons, garnered many award nominations, and received a spin-off series with Human Resources.\n- Subscription with ads\n- Yes, $8/month\n- Simultaneous streams\n- Two or four\nBig Mouth is an adult animated comedy centering around the oddness that comes with puberty.\n6 Cobra Kai\n|\nRelease Year |\n2018-2025 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n6 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n65 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nThe legend of The Karate Kid continues in Cobra Kai, following the villain Johnny Lawrence. After slipping into a depression due to his loser status, Johnny aims to redeem himself by tending to the Cobra Kai dojo. While his work at the dojo inspires a new generation of young people to defend themselves, an old rivalry returns when Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) enters the equation with his Miyagi dojo.\nWhile Cobra Kai will immediately be a draw for all the Gen-Xers who grew up with The Karate Kid movies, it has a strong enough story of redemption, legacy, and bravery that any young person can relate to. The arc of Johnny taking an interest in the teenager Miguel and standing up for himself is enduring, packed with inspirational moments. The earnest nature of leaning into the corny and compelling aspects of the franchise made this series such a treat and well worth a weekend binge.\n- Subscription with ads\n- Yes, $8/month\n- Simultaneous streams\n- Two or four\nCobra Kai continues the rivalry of Johnny and Danny for a new generation of teens to learn from the characters of The Karate Kid.\n5 The Handmaid's Tale\n|\nRelease Year |\n2017-2025 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n6 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n66 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nMargaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian novel The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was brought to life with dark and poignant accuracy in the hit Hulu show. In the future, America has been transformed into a theocracy of Gilead, where women have lost their rights. June (Elisabeth Moss) is forced into servitude as a handmaid, where she must bear the children for the elite. But she\u2019s had enough of this world and aims to rebel against the religious oppressors who stole her freedom and kidnapped her daughter.\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale is not easy to watch, considering how viciously accurate it is in describing our current political landscape. That said, it does carry a fury in its heart for revolution, and Moss\u2019s performance is stellar as a weary and revenge-oriented woman. There are also some genuine moments of hope and satisfaction, especially for the ending, which more or less delivers on Gilead crumbling. It is one of the more inspiring TV shows if you're big on stories about rebellion.\n- Subscription with ads\n- Yes, $10/month\n- Live TV\n- Yes, various plans available\nThe Handmaid's Tale depicts a dystopia built on religion and enslaving women, with the enslaved June aiming to fight back.\n4 What We Do in the Shadows\n|\nRelease Year |\n2019-2024 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n6 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n61 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nBased on the film of the same title, What We Do in the Shadows continued the mockumentary format of a quirky house of vampires. A camera crew documents the many absurd exploits of the subjects, including the slow-witted blood vampire Nandor and the energy-draining vampire Colin, while their familiar, Guillermo, attends to their needs. While Guillermo hopes his work will reward him with vampire status, he soon learns how unlikely that\u2019ll be for the dark discoveries he unearths.\nThere are too many hilarious moments in What We Do in the Shadows to count. Highlights of the show include Nadia\u2019s complicated on/off romance with a ghost and the British Lazlo\u2019s absurd Arizona persona of Jackie Daytona. With plenty of horror elements thrown into the mix, including a hilarious tribute to past movie vampires, I couldn\u2019t stop laughing at this darkly comedic take on vampires, biting enough to warrant several seasons and Emmy nominations.\n- Subscription with ads\n- Yes, $10/month\n- Live TV\n- Yes, various plans available\nWhat We Do In The Shadows depicts the amusing day-to-day activities of a vampire collective in New York City.\n3 Andor\n|\nRelease Year |\n2022-2025 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n2 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n24 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nAmong the myriad Star Wars TV shows, Andor is the clear winner for being divergent on the surface but spiritually faithful to the original trilogy. Set before the events of Rogue One, the series explores how Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) went from being a low-level punk to a high-level rebel. With the Empire\u2019s vicious grip tightening, tensions flare as he decides to join up with the resistance against an increasingly fascist government.\nEvery Live-Action Star Wars Show on Disney+, Ranked\nHours of entertainment in a galaxy far, far away.\nSteering away from Lightsabers and Jedi, Andor depicts a grittier version of Star Wars while remaining closer to George Lucas\u2019s real-world inspirations. The plot is intricate with its politics, and the characters within the Empire and Rebellion are richly complex. The two seasons present a more complete picture of the Star Wars universe and a surprisingly mature and nuanced take on war and oppression, emboldening the need for revolution.\nAndor takes place before the events of Rogue One, telling the story of how Cassian Andor came to fight with the rebels against the Empire.\n2 The Righteous Gemstones\n|\nRelease Year |\n2019-2025 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n4 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n36 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nReligious satire doesn\u2019t get more grand than The Righteous Gemstones. Created by and starring Danny McBride (Eastbound & Down), the series centers around the wealthy Gemstone family and their Christian business ventures. But their lives are a mess with the lingering trauma of the patriarchal Eli (John Goodman) and the moral decay of his spoiled children (McBride, Adam DeVine, and Edi Patterson).\nThe Righteous Gemstones doesn\u2019t skimp on the gaudy and gross-out satire, showcasing obscene opulence and even more obscene vulgarities. The whole cast is hilarious, but the standout is Walton Goggins in the unforgettable role of Uncle Baby Billy, the egotistical singing talent. There\u2019s great mockery of the rich and religious, but also enough thought placed on the characters to care a little more about their plight than laugh at their pathos.\n- Subscription with ads\n- Yes, $10/month\n- Simultaneous streams\n- 2 or 4\nThe Righteous Gemstones aims at the corruption of religion with satirical characters and vulgar humor.\n1 Squid Game\n|\nRelease Year |\n2021-2025 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n3 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n22 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nAs the most popular Netflix show in the past four years, Squid Game viciously attacks the ills of late-stage capitalism. A mysterious organization gives those saddled with debt the chance to play schoolyard games to win a big cash prize. But the games are difficult and deadly, leading to deception and betrayals in the fight for money.\nWith its haunting juxtaposition of weaponizing childhood play, Squid Game was gripping television, but not in the same way as watching a reality show. The insidious nature of desperation and greed is explored as the protagonist of Seong Gi-hun struggles to not only make ends meet, but also find a way to fight back. With intense games and unease in the many characters, it\u2019s nearly impossible to stop watching Squid Game once you start, making for the perfect weekend watch.\n- Subscription with ads\n- Yes, $8/month\n- Simultaneous streams\n- Two or four\nNow is the time to finally get caught up on all that must-watch TV everybody talks about. Whether you\u2019re into sitcoms, cartoons, or thrillers, there will surely be at least one streaming show worth catching up on. Best of all, you won\u2019t have to feel that familiar anxiety of waiting for more episodes or worrying about cancellation. Consider these binge-watches instead of rewatching Seinfeld for the 50th time."
