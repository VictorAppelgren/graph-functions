  "title": "Gevo Shares Skyrocket 65% After Hours on Strong Q2 Results - Gevo (NASDAQ:GEVO)",
  "description": "Gevo's stock jumped 65.6% after hours as strong Q2 earnings and clean fuel credit sales boosted investor confidence.",
  "content": "Gevo Inc. GEVO stock experienced a 65.6% surge during after-hours trading on Monday. The company\u2019s stock soared to $2.07 per share, up from a closing price of $1.25, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nWhat Happened: The surge in stock followed the release of Gevo\u2019s second-quarter financial results. The Colorado-based renewable company reported a positive net income of $2.1 million and achieved a positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization $17 million for the second quarter.\n\nFor the six months ending June 30, 2025, Gevo saw a $20 million increase in net income attributable to the company and a $32 million rise in adjusted EBITDA, both compared to the same period last year. These results were driven by the successful execution of low-carbon ethanol and carbon capture acquisition, as well as the first sales of clean fuel production credits.\n\nGevo\u2019s Clean Fuel Production Credit sales from low-carbon ethanol with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and renewable natural gas also contributed approximately $21 million to the net income and adjusted EBITDA during the six months.\n\nSee Also: Trump Administration Shuts Down A $66 Million Food Stamp Fraud And Bribery Scheme, Arrests USDA Employee And 5 Others\n\nDr. Patrick Gruber, CEO, Gevo, stated this was a landmark quarter for the company. He further added, \"Our results are delivering on the targets we said we would achieve this year, even sooner than we expected.\"\n\nWith a daily average volume of about 3.8 million shares, GEVO has traded between $0.54 and $3.39 over the past 52 weeks. Its current market capitalization is approximately $299.454 million, with today\u2019s volume at around 3.94 million shares.\n\nWhy It Matters: Gevo reported a $14 million increase in revenues quarter-over-quarter. The company\u2019s financial success was attributed to the commencement of Carbon Dioxide Removal (\u201cCDR\u201d) credit sales, which added a new co-product and revenue stream from a global marketplace. As per the press release, Gevo anticipates that CDR credit sales could reach $3-5 million by the end of the year.\n\nWith a strong Momentum in the 88th percentile, Benzinga\u2019s Edge Stock Rankings indicate that GEVO has a negative price trend across all time frames. Know how its momentum lines up with the other companies.\n\u2022 Trump\u2019s \u2018Narcos\u2019 Strategy Collides With Mexico\u2019s Strong Opposition To US Deployment\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.",

      "text": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has discovered a major food stamp fraud and bribery scheme, misappropriating millions of taxpayer dollars. This has led to the arrest of a USDA employee and five others.\nWhat Happened: The USDA, along with the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office, has indicted six individuals in connection with a bribery and fraud scheme involving the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), allegedly resulting in over $66 million in unauthorized transactions, stated a federal press release on Friday.\nThe defendants, namely Michael Kehoe, Mohamad Nawafleh, Omar Alrawashdeh, Gamal Obaid, Emad Alrawashdeh and Arlasa Davis, are charged with \u201cconspiracy to steal government funds and to misappropriate U.S. Department of Agriculture benefits,\u201d as per a press release.\n\u201cThis fraud was made possible when USDA employee Arlasa Davis betrayed the public trust by selling confidential government information to the very criminals she was supposed to catch,\u201d declared U.S. Attorney Perry Carbone.\nAccording to the indictment, the scheme started in 2019 with the formation of a network that distributed 160 unauthorized electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards to stores throughout New York, illegally processing more than $30 million in EBT transactions.\nThe group also faces accusations of submitting fraudulent USDA applications, misusing license numbers, and falsifying documents to register unauthorized stores.\nWhy It Matters: The Trump administration had been vocal about its intentions to revamp food assistance programs. In February, the new leadership at the USDA, including Kailee Buller, the chief of staff, had criticized the previous administration for what they termed as \u201cfinancial mismanagement\u201d of food benefits. The Trump administration had pledged to correct these issues.\nOn the other hand, the rollout of the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) food box initiative had been met with uncertainty and criticism, making it difficult for food organizations to plan ahead. The sudden changes and lack of communication from the Trump administration had also been a point of concern.\nThe 2026 budget proposal aims to cut the $425 million Commodity Supplemental Food Program, replacing it with \u201cMAHA boxes\u201d sourced directly from U.S. farmers, a move that could affect the grocery lifeline of over 730,000 seniors.\nImage via Shutterstock\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Retirement, ideally a period of relaxation and enjoyment after years of hard work, is often envisioned as a time to pursue hobbies, travel or simply unwind. But without a solid financial plan, many Americans worry they\u2019ll outlive their money. This fear is often more acute among married couples, who face the added complexity of planning for two people with varying financial needs.\nIf you're 50 or older and have over $100,000 in investable assets, now is the time to take retirement planning seriously. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be difficult. WiserAdvisor's free tool matches you with a vetted financial advisor that meets your needs, with no obligation to hire.\n60% of Americans Lack a Retirement-Specific Account\u2013 Do you?\nA NerdWallet study, using the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, indicates that 60% of Americans lack a retirement-specific account. The disparity in average household retirement savings by age group further illustrates this issue:\n- Under 35: $49,130 (median: $18,880)\n- Ages 35 to 44: $141,520 (median: $45,000)\n- Ages 45 to 54: $313,220 (median: $115,000)\n- Ages 55 to 64: $537,560 (median: $185,000)\n- Ages 65 to 74: $609,230 (median: $200,000)\nThese figures show a significant gap between average and median savings, pointing to a broad spectrum of financial preparedness across different age groups. Those nearing retirement, especially those with $250,000 or more in retirement savings, stand to benefit most from expert, fiduciary guidance.\nTo guide couples in their retirement planning, T. Rowe Price, a reputable global investment management firm, provides savings benchmarks as multiples of income, varying by household income and marital status.\nFor example, a dual-income married couple with an annual income of $75,000 at age 55 should have retirement savings equal to five times their income, which should increase to 8.5 times by age 65. These benchmarks scale up for higher-income brackets, and for those with $250,000 or more in assets, strategic investment planning becomes especially important.\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\nIf you\u2019ve worked hard to build a nest egg of $100,000 or more, WiserAdvisor can connect you with a trusted, independent fiduciary advisor who understands the unique financial needs of pre-retirees and retirees.\nFiduciary advisors are legally required to put your interests first. They can help you:\n- Create a tax-smart drawdown plan\n- Manage and grow a diversified investment portfolio\n- Maximize Social Security strategies\n- Protect assets for your spouse or heirs\n- The matching service is fast and free\u2014and designed specifically for individuals with significant investable assets who are looking for personalized, high-quality advice.\nTake the first step toward a more confident retirement. If you have at least $100,000 in investable assets, WiserAdvisor can match you with a pre-screened fiduciary financial advisor in your area.\nBook here to get started; no cost, no obligation.\nBenzinga Money is a reader-supported publication.
