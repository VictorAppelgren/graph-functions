  "content": "MANAHAWKIN, NJ \u2014 As summer comes to an end and the new school year is set to begin, you can help kids get off to a strong start by donating school supplies at the Doherty-owned Applebee's Restaurants' annual \"Stuff the Bus\" school supply drive. Again in 2025, the Manahawkin location will be participating.\n\nEach year, participating locations turn their parking lots into donation hubs by parking a bright yellow school bus outside the restaurant. By donating school supplies or cash contributions, guests can help \"stuff the bus\" and support local school districts. All collected items and funds will be loaded directly onto the bus and delivered to three local school districts helping students start the school year off right with the supplies they need to succeed.\n\n\u201cGiving back to our neighborhoods stands tall as a pillar of our company\u2019s mission,\u201d said Tim Doherty, President of Doherty Enterprises. \u201cOur annual Stuff the Bus campaign has become a late summer tradition we look forward to as another school year approaches. It\u2019s amazing to see the generosity of our guests and how many local students benefit from their kindness.\u201d Guests and community members are encouraged to drop off donations during their next Applebee\u2019s visit. Last year\u2019s effort raised more than $33,000 worth of supplies and donations for local schools.",
