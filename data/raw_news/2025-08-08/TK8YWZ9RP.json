  "description": "This is the latest move the Trump administration has made to bar transgender people from enlisting or serving in the military.",
  "content": "The U.S. Air Force will deny transgender airmen and airwomen with 15 to 18 years of experience who are being forced out the option to retire early, instead separating them without retirement benefits.\n\nThe affected servicemembers will not have the opportunity to either take a lump-sum separation payment offered to junior troops or be removed from the service, according to Reuters.\n\nThis is the latest move the Trump administration has made to bar transgender people from enlisting or serving in the military. The Pentagon, under Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, views those with gender dysphoria as being \u201cincompatible with military service.\u201d An Air Force spokesperson told the Washington Examiner, \u201cAlthough service members with 15 to 18 years of honorable service were permitted to apply for an exception to policy, none of the exceptions to policy were approved.\u201d About a dozen transgender airmen and airwomen were \u201cprematurely notified\u201d that they would be able to retire before that decision was overturned. Brian Scarlett, who is performing the duties of assistant secretary of the Air Force for manpower and reserve affairs, signed an Aug. 4 memo rejecting all of the exceptions. This memo comes after a May 23 memo that said Air Force personnel with 15 to 18 years of service could request early retirement. The Air Force did approve early retirement for more senior service members who self-identified as transgender and had between 18 and 20 years of service. Regular military retirement happens after 20 years. Despite legal challenges, a Supreme Court ruling in May allowed the department to implement a ban on transgender people from serving in the Armed Forces.",

      "text": "TRUMP: \u2018IT\u2019S GOING TO BE UP TO HIM\u2019: Today\u2019s the deadline that President Donald Trump set for Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to negotiate a ceasefire in the Ukraine war or face secondary sanctions intended to make it harder for Russia to sell oil, the mainstay of its struggling economy.\nHowever, with active discussion underway to arrange a summit between the two presidents as soon as next week, Trump is noncommittal about whether he\u2019ll follow through with the threat. Asked by a reporter at the White House yesterday, \u201cIs your deadline still standing?\u201d for Putin to agree to a ceasefire, Trump replied. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to him. We\u2019re going to see what he has to say, but it\u2019s going to be up to him. Very disappointed.\u201d\nEarlier in the day, a White House official told the Associated Press that Trump\u2019s agreement to meet face-to-face with Putin had been conditional on Putin agreeing to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump quickly rendered that statement inoperative. \u201cDoes Putin have to meet with Zelensky in order and before you and Putin have to meet?\u201d Trump was asked.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to agree to meet with Zelensky? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins pressed Trump.\n\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t. No, no,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cThey would like to meet with me, and I\u2019ll do whatever I can to stop the killing. So last month, they lost 14,000 people, killed last month,\u201d he said. \u201cMostly it\u2019s soldiers, and you\u2019re talking about, on average, 20,000 a month. 20,000 people are dying a month, young \u2014generally young people, soldiers.\nMEANWHILE IN MOSCOW: In a brief interaction with reporters at the Kremlin, Putin \u2014 who has repeatedly asserted that Zelensky is not the legitimate leader of Ukraine \u2014 appeared dismissive of the idea of sitting down with Zelensky.\n\u201cI have said repeatedly that I have no objection to meeting with him in principle. It is possible, but certain conditions must be in place first. Unfortunately, we are still far from that point,\u201d Putin said, according to the official Kremlin transcript.\nThe Kremlin has previously said that Putin and Zelensky should only meet after subordinates have negotiated the terms of a peace agreement.\nPutin, who had just finished meeting with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the president of the UAE, also suggested that the venue for his meeting with Trump will likely be in the Gulf region.\n\u201cWe have many friends willing to help organize such events. One of them is the president of the United Arab Emirates,\u201d Putin said. \u201cThe exact venue is still being decided, but the UAE would be one of the suitable options.\u201d\nZELENSKY, EUROPE FEAR BEING SIDELINED: Zelensky said in his discussions with President Trump, he made clear that Ukraine and its European allies must be front and center in any peace process.\n\u201cEveryone also agrees that Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine is a war in Europe and against Europe. Every decision that will be made to end this war and guarantee security truly concerns all of Europe, not just one country. That\u2019s why Europe\u2019s voice must carry weight in the processes,\u201d Zelensky said in his nightly video address.\n\u201cIt is just that Ukraine be a participant in the negotiations. Russia\u2019s war is against Ukraine, against our independence as the embodiment of the independence of every European nation,\u201d Zelensky said, \u201cSo the format of meetings, of leaders\u2019 meetings, is, in particular, a trilateral format. And we discussed this in detail yesterday \u2014 several bilateral formats, the trilateral format, all the options.\u201d\nIn a post on X, The Ukrainian Review quoted former British Defense Minister Ben Wallace as saying, \u201cBritain must be invited to peace talks to stop Zelensky from being bullied by Trump and Putin.\u201d\nMCGURK: \u2018THE GOAL IS A CEASEFIRE\u2019: Brett McGurk, former Middle East and North Africa coordinator for the National Security Council, argued that Trump has a strong hand going into the talks with Putin, assuming that, like any good negotiator, he\u2019s willing to walk away from a bad deal.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s coming in with a lot of leverage. I think Putin is reacting to the new policy the President announced a few weeks ago, sanctions, weapons through NATO to Ukraine. I think that surprised him a little bit. The strikes in Iran, Putin understands power. That was an assertion of American power,\u201d McGurk said on CNN last night.\n\u201cThe President has to go in with the only outcome that\u2019s successful is a ceasefire. Anything short of that, you got to walk away from the table and try to get the ceasefire later,\u201d McGurk argued. \u201cThe goal is a ceasefire. Anything short of that and Putin will come in with all sorts of promises and maps and details and make it look like he\u2019s actually being reasonable. It\u2019s a ceasefire or not. If there\u2019s not a ceasefire, you have to walk away from the table.\u201d\n\u201cI would not have this summit unless you\u2019re very confident that you\u2019re going to come out with a ceasefire,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing that right now.\u201d\nTRUMP SAYS PUTIN DOESN\u2019T HAVE TO MEET WITH ZELENSKY AHEAD OF BILATERAL MEETING\nGood Friday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre\u2019s Daily on Defense, written and compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre (@jamiejmcintyre) and edited by Christopher Tremoglie.

We intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free of [Hamas], and to pass it to civilian governance that is not Hamas and not anyone advocating the destruction of Israel,\u201d Netanyahu replied. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want to do. We want to liberate ourselves and liberate the people of Gaza from the awful terror of Hamas.\u201d\n\u201cAre you saying today that you will take control of the entire 26-mile Gaza Strip, as it was 20 years ago to this month in 2005?\u201d Hemmer followed up.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter. We don\u2019t want to govern it. We don\u2019t want to be there as a governing body. We want to hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly, without threatening us, and giving the Gazans a good life,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible with Hamas.\u201d\nThe timing of what would no doubt be another major ground operation remains unclear, given that it will require a significant mobilization of additional Israeli troops, as well as giving time for civilians to evacuate the city.\nIn a statement posted on X, Netanyahu\u2019s office said, \u201cThe IDF will prepare for taking control of Gaza City while distributing humanitarian assistance to the civilian population outside the combat zones.\u201d\nNETANYAHU: ISRAEL INTENDS TO CONTROL ALL OF GAZA BEFORE HANDING IT TO \u2018ARAB FORCES\u2019\nU.K.\u2019S STARMER: \u2018WHAT WE NEED IS A CEASEFIRE\u2019: While earlier this week President Trump said what Israel does in Gaza is \u201cpretty much up to Israel,\u201d and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told CBS News, \u201cIt\u2019s not our job to tell them what they should or should not do,\u201d Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Keir Starmer took a harder line.\n\u201cThe Israeli Government\u2019s decision to further escalate its offensive in Gaza is wrong, and we urge it to reconsider immediately. This action will do nothing to bring an end to this conflict or to help secure the release of the hostages. It will only bring more bloodshed,\u201d Starmer said in a statement from 10 Downing Street. \u201cWhat we need is a ceasefire, a surge in humanitarian aid, the release of all hostages by Hamas, and a negotiated solution. Hamas can play no part in the future of Gaza and must leave as well as disarm.\u201d\nSENIOR EU OFFICIAL SUGGESTS ISRAEL\u2019S WAR IN GAZA \u2018LOOKS VERY MUCH\u2019 LIKE \u2018GENOCIDE\u2019\nPENTAGON BUILDING IMMIGRANT DETENTION CENTER AT TEXAS BASE: The Pentagon revealed details yesterday about the construction, already underway, of a massive migrant detention center at the U.S. Army Base in Fort Bliss, Texas.\n\u201cWork has begun for initial detainment capacity of 1,000 illegal aliens with initial operating capacity likely to be achieved by mid-late August,\u201d Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson told reporters in an off-camera briefing yesterday. \u201cOnce DOD achieves initial stand up, we will finish construction for up to 5,000 beds in the weeks and months ahead.\u201d\n\u201cUpon completion, this will be the largest federal detention center in history for this critical mission, the deportation of illegal aliens,\u201d Wilson said.\nHEGSETH: \u2018DRILL SERGEANTS WITH KNIFE HANDS\u2019: \u201cBay tossing\u201d and \u201cshark attacks\u201d are back for news recruits, as part of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s recent directive to make basic training \u201cGreat Again.\u201d\n\u201cA shark attack is when drill sergeants surround one particular enlistee, right, creating a stressful situation that they have to figure out how to manage, to bed-tossing inside barracks after you have had a long day doing \u2014 on the range or walking patrol,\u201d Hegseth explained in an appearance on Fox News\u2019 Will Cain show.\nThe tactics were banned, but Hegseth says he\u2019s bringing them back to toughen up recruits and instill a warrior ethic. \u201cAnyone who went through any form of basic training for decades understood, as a recruit, you were going into a crucible. You were going to be forged. You were going to be challenged. You were going to be scared, nervous, and anxious, and, by coming through that, you were going to be forged an American warrior.\u201d\n\u201cThis is basic stuff. This is not beyond what\u2019s been done. This is a restoration,\u201d Hegseth said. \u201cWe are going back to basics. Drill sergeants will be drill sergeants with knife hands who ensure \u2014 who maintain good order and discipline and train up great recruits who will make great formations, just like we need military officers with that same rigorous discipline and background.\u201d\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nTHE RUNDOWN:\nWashington Examiner: Trump says Putin doesn\u2019t have to meet with Zelensky ahead of bilateral meeting\nWashington Examiner: Israeli Cabinet greenlights Netanyahu plan to occupy Gaza City\nWashington Examiner: Netanyahu: Israel intends to control all of Gaza before handing it to \u2018Arab forces\u2019\nWashington Examiner: Senior EU official suggests Israel\u2019s war in Gaza \u2018looks very much\u2019 like \u2018genocide\u2019\nWashington Examiner: Tom Cotton calls on DOD to bar foreigners from access to Pentagon online systems\nWashington Examiner: Army Secretary Dan Driscoll credits soldiers who tackled Fort Stewart shooter for ending attack\nWashington Examiner: Powering deterrence: John Phelan\u2019s vision for an unstoppable Navy\nWashington Examiner: China\u2019s stranglehold on rare earth elements threatens America\u2019s national security\nWashington Examiner: Opinion: Defense Department lies about fixing grave Afghan allies error\nWashington Post: Putin suggests meeting Trump in UAE as Kremlin senses advantage\nWall Street Journal: How Trump and Putin Reached a New Make-or-Break Moment on Ukraine\nAP: Israel announces plan to retake Gaza City in another escalation of the war\nNBC: Satellite images show Israel building up forces for a possible ground invasion of Gaza, sources say\nAP: Trust in Zelenskyy is diminished even after reversal of law that fueled anti-corruption protests\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: Air Force Reverses Offer of Early Retirement for Transgender Troops\nStars and Stripes: Air Force Recruit Disqualified From Service Over Weight-Loss Surgery Sues DOD for Discrimination\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: Ukraine\u2019s Operation Spiderweb Has Implications for Golden Dome\nBreaking Defense: DoD Considering \u2018Czar\u2019 Roles For Key Navy, Air Force Programs: Sources\nThe Hill: Democrats Press Air Force on Qatar Jet Funding Details\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: Bombers Should Be Ready for Continuous Ops, 2-Star Says\nDefense News: Space Force Wargame Could Inform Framework for Allied Info Sharing\nDefense One: ULA\u2019s Heavy-Lift Rocket Prepares to Launch First Space Force Mission\nTHE CALENDAR:\nFRIDAY | AUGUST 8\n7 p.m. 610 Water St. SW \u2014 Politics and Prose Bookstore book discussion: The Devil Reached Toward the Sky: An Oral History of the Making and Unleashing of the Atomic Bomb, with author Garrett Graff, host of the Doomsday Scenario newsletter https://politics-prose.com/garrett-graff"

      "text": "Germany\u2019s government will indefinitely halt all military equipment exports that could be used in Gaza, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced on Friday.\nThe statement comes after the Israeli Security Cabinet agreed with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plan to occupy Gaza City, a plan that makes it more feasible for Netanyahu to achieve his original objective of a gradual occupation of the entire Gaza Strip.\nMerz said Israel \u201chas the right to defend itself against Hamas\u2019 terror,\u201d and insisted Germany\u2019s priority is a ceasefire negotiation and the release of the Israeli hostages Hamas took during its brutal Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\u201cThe even harsher military action by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, approved last night by the Israeli Security Cabinet, makes it increasingly difficult for the German government to see how these goals will be achieved,\u201d Merz said in his statement. \u201cUnder these circumstances, the German government will not authorize any exports of military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice.\u201d\nMerz said the German government is \u201cdeeply concerned about the ongoing suffering\u201d of Gaza civilians and flagged that the Israeli government \u201cbears even greater responsibility\u201d for delivering the needs of Gaza civilians with the planned offensive to occupy Gaza City.\n\u201cIt must allow comprehensive access for aid deliveries, including for UN organizations and other non-governmental institutions,\u201d Merz said in the statement. \u201cFollowing the correct steps taken in recent days, Israel must continue to comprehensively and sustainably improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza.\u201d\nGermany\u2019s stance comes after worldwide reaction to images and reporting out of Gaza on the deteriorating humanitarian situation there. On Thursday, the European Commission Executive Vice President Teresa Ribera told Politico that Israel\u2019s actions in its war in Gaza look \u201cvery much\u201d like genocide.\nAs the Washington Examiner reported Thursday, Ribera\u2019s stance had served as the polar opposite of the approach Germany has taken to its relationship with Israel. Germany, in reparation for the holocaust, has long been a vehement supporter of Israel.\nOn Tuesday, a German official told Politico that the country\u2019s \u201cunyielding stance\u201d was a positive influence on the Israeli government\u2019s approach to Gaza humanitarian aid. On Thursday, an official said that positive developments in Israel\u2019s humanitarian aid approach to Gaza \u201cbecame clear\u201d during a \u201cvery long and very good\u201d phone call between Merz and Israeli President Isaac Herzog.\nISRAELI CABINET GREENLIGHTS NETANYAHU PLAN TO OCCUPY GAZA CITY\nWith Merz\u2019s statement on Friday, Germany is taking a more resistant stance. The chancellor concluded his statement discussing the West Bank.\n\u201cFurthermore, the German government urgently calls on the Israeli government to refrain from taking any further steps toward annexing the West Bank,\u201d Merz said.\nNetanyahu spoke with Merz after the decision to \u201cexpress his dissapointment,\u201d according to the Prime Minister\u2019s office.\n\u201cInstead of supporting Israel\u2019s just war against Hamas, Germany is rewarding Hamas terrorism by embargoing arms to Israel,\u201d the office told Axios in a statement. \u201cNetanyahu said that Israel\u2019s goal is not to take over Gaza, but to free Gaza from Hamas and enable a peaceful government to be established there\u201d"

      "text": "The U.S. military will discharge transgender troops in the coming weeks unless they are granted an individualized waiver, the Department of Defense announced in a memo that became public Wednesday.\n\u201cService members who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria will be processed for separation from military service,\u201d said a memo from the official performing the duties of the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness.\nIt specifically gave a 30-day deadline for senior leaders to \u201cidentify service members who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria\u201d before beginning separation actions within 30 days of identification.\nThe memo was revealed in a court filing as a part of the legal challenge to President Donald Trump\u2018s executive order from last month directing the Pentagon to implement its own policies regarding the administration\u2019s belief that identifying as transgender is incompatible with military service.\n\u201cThe Department only recognizes two sexes: male and female. An individual\u2019s sex is immutable, unchanging during a person\u2019s life. All service members will only serve in accordance with their sex,\u201d the memo said, adding that affected troops may be \u201cconsidered for a waiver on a case-by-case basis, provided there is a compelling government interest in retaining the service member that directly supports warfighting capabilities.\u201d\nA transgender service member can stay in the military if they are able to prove they\u2019ve gone through \u201c36 consecutive months of stability\u201d in their sex with no \u201cclinically significant distress or impairment.\u201d They also need to prove they have \u201cnever attempted to transition to any sex other than their sex\u201d and have to be willing to adhere to \u201call applicable standards\u201d relating to their sex.\nTransgender advocates condemned the memo and have opposed the overarching policy since the first Trump administration.\n\u201cThe assertion that gender dysphoria is incompatible with military service is both medically unsound and a blatant disregard for the proven capabilities and dedication of transgender individuals who have served and continue to serve with distinction,\u201d the Modern Military Association of America, an LGBTQ military advocacy group, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cIt sends a damaging message to the world about the values of the United States.\u201d\nPENTAGON BANS TRANS PEOPLE FROM ENLISTING, STOPS TRANSITION PROCEDURES\nEarlier this month, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued a memo informing senior Department of Defense leaders that the department would stop accepting transgender individuals into the military and stop impending transition procedures.\nThe military does not have a specific tally for the number of transgender individuals in the military, though a 2018 independent study by the Palm Center, which researches such subjects, assessed that there were about 14,000 transgender troops.\nThe military lifted a ban on transgender troops in 2016 during the Obama administration. Trump reversed the policy following court battles in 2019, while his successor, former President Joe Biden, undid Trump\u2019s reversal just days after taking office."

As Krishnamoorthi said, they are in everything that moves by electricity.\nAnd China, he said, \u201cproduces 90% of the world\u2019s rare earth magnets.\u201d\nIn April, China cut off the export of rare earth elements to the U.S. in retaliation for President Donald Trump\u2019s 34% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff on Chinese imports.\nThe effects were immediate.\nFord was forced to halt production of certain advanced vehicles at its Chicago facility, its oldest plant in the U.S.\nBut the shock to the U.S. defense industrial base was even greater.\nChina maintains a near monopoly on a slew of rare earth elements, including dysprosium, gadolinium, germanium, gallium, lutetium, scandium, ytterbium, and yttrium.\nBut one in particular, samarium, is perhaps the most vital to the U.S. defense industry.\nSamarium is essential in making the heat-resistant magnets required for F-35 stealth fighters, which need magnets that can function at extremely high temperatures generated by jet engines.\nThere are some 50 pounds of samarium magnets in a single F-35, and according to one estimate cited by RAND, each plane has a total of 920 pounds of various rare earth elements.\nAs a result of recent trade negotiations, China has since relaxed restrictions on some rare earth elements used for non-military purposes, but it\u2019s maintaining a chokehold on anything related to national security.\nThis has forced defense manufacturers to scramble for alternate, and far more expensive, sources of rare earth minerals, which are needed for everything from drone motors and night-vision goggles to microelectronics and missile-targeting systems.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that one U.S company was quoted a price for samarium 60 times the going rate.\nAs the Trump administration works to reach a trade deal with China, the ban on magnets is a key sticking point.\n\u201cI won\u2019t go into detail, because they\u2019re confidential conversations between two governments, but they are really focused on rare earth magnets and minerals,\u201d U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation.\n\u201cChina has put a global control on the world, and so for the United States, we\u2019re focused on making sure that the flow of magnets from China to the United States and the adjacent supply chain can flow as freely as it did before the control,\u201d Greer said. \u201cAnd I would say we\u2019re about halfway there.\u201d\nYou might think that China\u2019s chokehold on critical supply chains is because rare earth elements are hard to find, difficult to mine, and mostly in China.\nBut it turns out that while they are rare, they\u2019re not that rare. They\u2019re also not hard to mine, so long as you don\u2019t care about the effects on the environment.\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that the U.S. was the primary source of samarium magnets, a result of research by General Motors in the 1980s.\nBy the 1990s, the U.S. was manufacturing the magnets in Indiana and mining the rare earth elements in the desert at Mountain Pass, California, near the Nevada border.\nThe mine violated environmental restrictions, and the cost of cleanup made it unprofitable, so it shut down.\nMeanwhile, China, unencumbered by environmental concerns, began to realize it was sitting on a gold mine.\nAs then-Chinese Finance Minister Deng Xiaoping famously said in 1992, \u201cThe Middle East has oil, China has rare earths.\u201d\n\u201cThese rare earths are not that hard to mine. It doesn\u2019t take lots of big, sophisticated equipment,\u201d Keith Bradsher, Beijing bureau chief for the New York Times, said in a recent podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s called bucket chemistry. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of resources to do it. All it really takes is a corrupt local politician willing to look the other way as you start digging holes in public lands, and dumping chemicals in them, and pumping out what comes out of the bottom of the hillside.\u201d\nRare earth exports from China became plentiful and cheap until a spat between China and Japan underscored the problem of overreliance on Beijing as the sole source for rare earth elements.\nIn 2010, tensions over ownership of a group of uninhabited islands near Taiwan prompted Beijing to cut off Japan\u2019s supplies of rare earth minerals for two months.\nSeeking a more stable supply chain, Japan subsidized a mine in Australia.\nThe U.S. also began to seek to lessen its dependence on China and invested roughly a billion dollars to address the environmental concerns at Mountain Pass and reopen the mine.\nBut the flood of cheap rare earth minerals from China cut global prices and forced the mine into bankruptcy in 2015 after operating for only one year.\nWhile causing near-term shortages, the current crisis may have a long-term positive effect if it results in the U.S. making a new commitment to developing a domestic rare earth industry.\n\u201cOur country, with the largest economy in the world, sits atop many rare earth minerals vital to our future prosperity, but China has a near monopoly, 90%, on the ability to process them,\u201d Rahm Emanuel, former U.S. ambassador to Japan, told the House committee last month.\n\u201cWe must answer CCP coercion with resolve, unity, and resilience. That means building a collective defense among the democratic nations against coercion. It means investing at home and diversifying our supply chains,\u201d he said.\nThe Pentagon has already taken a major step, entering into a multibillion-dollar public-private partnership with MP Materials, operator of Mountain Pass, to build a new rare earth separation facility and a second domestic magnet manufacturing plant at the site.\nChina\u2019s actions have given the mine, the world\u2019s second largest, a new lease on life.\nTAXPAYERS NEED GOOD GOVERNMENT DATA\nThe 10-year agreement will make the Defense Department the company\u2019s largest shareholder with an investment of $400 million in newly created preferred stock, and will cement the company\u2019s status as a national strategic asset.\n\u201cThis initiative marks a decisive action by the Trump administration to accelerate American supply chain independence,\u201d James Litinsky, founder, chairman, and CEO of MP Materials, said in a press release."

This decision follows a memo that rejected all requests for exceptions to the policy, despite prior indications that early retirement might be possible. In related news, President Trump has set a deadline for Russian President Putin to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine, while Israel's security cabinet has approved plans to retake Gaza City, prompting international calls for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid.",
