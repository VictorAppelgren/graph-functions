      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid start but still feels like a high‑level overview rather than a world‑class, horizon‑focused scenario map. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly linking the “big beautiful bill” fiscal tightening to real‑rate expectations, consumer disposable income, and the shift toward private‑label and budget durable goods; quantify the debt‑to‑GDP trajectory (e.g., 120% by 2028) and the projected 3–4% private‑label sales CAGR (YQOMV2HAJ). Anchor the Barista FIRE narrative with concrete data—e.g., 71% of retirees staying active (source 9) and the 40–60k‑mile lifespan of Douglas tires (source 2)—and explain how this labor‑market shift dampens velocity but sustains demand for low‑price durable goods. Add a clear timing window: 2025‑mid‑2026 for the bill’s immediate impact, 2026‑2028 for debt‑to‑GDP stabilization, and 2026‑2027 for the mid‑term election outcome as a path‑dependency trigger. Include alternative scenarios (e.g., Democratic rollback of the bill) with specific risk thresholds (real rate >4% or CPI >3%). Cite each claim with the appropriate source ID (e.g., YQOMV2HAJ, EPJYXB7DX, UPV3X2MQ6, 9) and reconcile any conflicting data (e.g., differing CPI projections). Finally, end with a concise base case, two alt paths, key risks, watch signals, and a confidence rating. This will elevate depth, clarity, and first‑principles rigor while meeting the 3–6‑month horizon and format constraints.",
