  "title": "Is crime in Washington DC 'out of control', as Trump claims?",
  "description": "President Trump says he will deploy hundreds of troops to Washington DC to address crime there.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump has said he will deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington DC and is taking control of its police department to fight crime.\n\nAt a press conference, he declared \"Liberation Day\" for the city and pledged to \"rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse\".\n\nHowever, Mayor Muriel Bowser has said the city has \"seen a huge decrease in crime\" and that it was \"at a 30-year violent crime low\".\n\nBBC Verify looks at what the figures show about violent crime in the capital and how it compares to other cities in the US.\n\nIs violent crime up in Washington DC?\n\nTrump's executive order declaring \"a crime emergency in the District of Columbia\" mentions \"rising violence in the capital\". In his press conference he made repeated references to crime being \"out of control\".\n\nBut according to crime figures published by Washington DC's Metropolitan Police (MPDC), violent offences fell after peaking in 2023 and in 2024 hit their lowest level in 30 years.\n\nThey are continuing to fall, according to preliminary data for 2025.\n\nViolent crime overall is down 26% this year compared to the same point in 2024, and robbery is down 28%, according to the MPDC.\n\nTrump and the DC Police Union have questioned the veracity of the city police department's crime figures.\n\nViolent crime is reported differently by the MPDC and the FBI - another major source of US crime statistics.\n\nMPDC public data showed a 35% fall for 2024, while the FBI data showed a 9% drop.\n\nSo the figures agree that crime is falling in DC, but differ on the level of that decline.\n\nThe downward trend is \"unmistakable and large\", according to Adam Gelb, the CEO of the Council on Criminal Justice (CCJ), a legal think tank.\n\n\"The numbers shift depending on what time period and what types of crime you examine,\" said Mr Gelb.\n\n\"But overall there's an unmistakable and large drop in violence since the summer of 2023, when there were peaks in homicide, gun assaults, robbery, and carjacking.\"\n\nTrump also claimed that \"murders in 2023 reached the highest rate probably ever\" in Washington DC - adding that numbers \"just go back 25 years\".\n\nWhen we asked the White House the source for the figures, they said it was \"numbers provided by the FBI\".\n\nThe homicide rate did spike in 2023 to around 40 per 100,000 residents - the highest rate in 20 years, according to FBI data.\n\nHowever, that was not the highest ever recorded - it was significantly higher in the 1990s and in the early 2000s.\n\nThe homicide rate dropped in 2024 and this year it is down 12% on the same point last year, according to the MPDC.\n\nStudies have suggested that the capital's homicide rate is higher than average, when compared to other major US cities.\n\nAs of 11 August, there have been 99 homicides so far this year in Washington DC - including a 21-year-old congressional intern shot dead in crossfire, a case Trump referred to in his press conference.\n\nThe president also mentioned the case of a 19-year-old former employee of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) who was injured in an alleged attempted carjacking in the capital at the start of August.\n\nTrump claimed \"the number of carjackings has more than tripled\" over the last five years.\n\nSo far this year, the MPDC has recorded 189 carjacking offences, down from 300 in the same period last year.\n\nAccording to the CCJ, carjacking rose markedly from 2020 onward and spiked to a monthly peak of 140 reported incidents in June 2023.\n\nSince July 2025, a citywide curfew has been in force for people under the age of 17 from 23:00 to 06:00.\n\nIt was introduced to combat juvenile crime - including carjacking - which often spikes in the summer months.\n\nHow does crime compare to other parts of the US?\n\n\"The level of violence in the District remains mostly higher than the average of three dozen cities in our sample,\" Mr Gelb from the CCJ told us.\n\n\"Although it is consistent with what we're seeing in other large cities across the country,\" he added.\n\nThe CCJ looks at crime rates across 30 large US cities.\n\nIts analysis suggests that the homicide rate in DC fell 19% in the first half of this year (January-June 2025), compared with the same period last year.\n\nThis is a slightly larger fall than the 17% average decline across the cities in the CCJ's study sample.\n\nHowever, if you take the first six months of 2025 and compare it to the same period in 2019 - before the Covid-19 pandemic - it shows only a 3% fall in homicides.\n\nAcross the 30 cities in the study, that decrease was 14% over the same timeframe.\n\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

  "summary": "President Donald Trump has declared \"Liberation Day\" in Washington DC, declaring a crime emergency and taking control of the city's police department to combat crime. However, according to crime figures by Washington DC's Metropolitan Police (MPDC) and FBI, violent offences have fallen after peaking in 2023 and in 2024, reaching their lowest level in 30 years. These figures are reported differently by the MPDC and the FBI, which differ on the level of crime decline. The Council on Criminal Justice (CCJ) CEO Adam Gelb described a large decrease in violence as \"unmistakable and large\" according to the CEO of the think tank. The homicide rate dropped in 2024 and this year it is down 12% on the same point last year, down from the same period last year.",

      "text": "Stay up to date on MPD's latest news alerts here: https://mpdc.dc.gov/newsroom\nYour car is replaceable, but you\u2019re not. Carjacking is a crime of violence that can be particularly scary. Knowing how to respond in a situation may mean the difference between serious injury or death and walking away unscathed.\nThe crime of \u201ccarjacking\u201d \u2014 which is stealing a car by force \u2014 captures headlines across the country. Statistically speaking, however, your chances of being a victim of carjacking are very slim, and taking preventive measures can reduce that risk even more.\nWho Does It Happen To?\n- Carjacking is a crime of opportunity \u2014 a criminal searching for the most vulnerable potential victim. Sometimes it is the first step in another crime.\n- Up until 1993, carjacking was reported as either armed robbery or auto theft in the District of Columbia. In response to several highly-publicized incidents, the D.C. Council passed laws providing stiffer penalties for individuals arrested and convicted of carjacking. It is critical that victims report these crimes to the police.\n- Carjacking is not just a problem for large cities \u2014 it happens in suburbs, rural areas, and small towns.\n- Even though carjacking can take place at any time, a large share of those cases appears to occur during the late night hours.\n- Carjackers are looking for an opportunity. They don\u2019t discriminate, so the victim\u2019s sex, race, or age is usually not a factor.\nWhere Do Carjackers Find Their Victims?\nCarjacking can take place anywhere, although some locations are more common:\n- ATMs (automated teller machines)\n- Self-serve gas stations and car washes\n- Garages and parking lots of shopping malls, grocery stores and mass transit\n- Intersections that are controlled by stop lights or signs\n- Highway exit and entry ramps, or anyplace else where drivers slow down or stop\n- Residential driveways and streets as people get into and out of vehicles\nWhat Do I Do If It Happens to Me?\n- If the carjacker threatens you with a gun or other weapon, GIVE UP YOUR CAR! Don\u2019t argue. Your life is definitely worth more than a car!\n- Get away from the area as quickly as possible.\n- Try to remember what the carjacker looked like \u2014 sex, race, age, hair and eye color, special features, clothes.\n- REPORT THE CRIME IMMEDIATELY TO THE POLICE BY CALLING 9-1-1.\nHow Do I Reduce My Risk of Becoming a Victim?\nBelow are ways that drivers can avoid becoming a target of these crimes:\n- Always lock your car\n- Never leave your vehicle idling/running unattended \u2013 even if your key fob is on you, someone can still drive off with your car until it stops or gas runs out\n- Always keep track of your keys, never leave them inside the vehicle\n- Do not leave children unattended inside your vehicle\n- Park in a safe spot\n- Stay alert and aware of your surroundings\n- If you see suspicious activity, report it anonymously by calling (202) 727-9099\n- If you are a victim of a crime, report it immediately by calling 911\nWhat are some safety tips to avoid being a victim?\n- Park in well-lighted areas, near sidewalks or walkways. AVOID parking near dumpsters, large vans or trucks, woods, or anything else that limits your visibility.\n- NEVER leave valuables out in plain view, even if the car is locked. ALWAYS put them in the trunk or out of sight.\n- Try to park in a garage with an attendant. Leave only the ignition key, with no identification.\n- Even if you\u2019re rushed, LOOK AROUND before you get out and STAY ALERT to the surroundings.\n- Always trust your instincts. If the situation doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel right,\u201d get away."

      "text": "Juvenile Curfew Emergency Amendment Act of 2025\nThe Juvenile Curfew Emergency Amendment Act of 2025 took effect on July 7, 2025. An 11:00 p.m. curfew is now in effect citywide every night for all persons age 17 and under though August 31, 2025.\nWhat does the law say?\nThe Juvenile Curfew Emergency Amendment Act of 2025 states that persons age 17 or younger cannot remain in any public place or on the premises of any establishment within the District of Columbia during curfew hours, unless they are involved in certain exempted activities.\nThe law gives the Chief of Police the authority to establish Extended Juvenile Curfew Zones and allows the Mayor of the District of Columbia to authorize an Emergency Juvenile Curfew.\nWhat are the curfew hours?\nNow through August 31, 2025 :\n- Curfew hours are 11:00 pm to 6 am, seven days a week\nBeginning September 1, 2025:\n- Curfew begins at 11 pm on Sunday through Thursday nights, and continues until 6 am the following day\n- Curfew hours are 12:01 am to 6 am on Saturday and Sunday (curfew on \"Friday night\" begins at 12:01 am Saturday; curfew on \"Saturday night\" begins at 12:01 am Sunday)\nJuvenile Curfew Zones\nIn Juvenile Curfew Zones, any person age 17 and under gathering in a group of nine (9) or more youths in any public place or on the premises of any establishment within the perimeter of an extended juvenile curfew zone must leave the area unless engaged in certain exempted activities. The Chief of Police will designate the curfew hours within these zones and communicate them to the public, but they will not begin before 8:00 pm or end after 6 am.\nA list of declared Juvenile Curfew Zones is available in a link at the bottom of this page.\nJuvenile Curfew Zone Petition\nPursuant to the emergency law, an Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC), business improvement district (BID), or Main Street organization may petition the Chief of Police to establish a Juvenile Curfew Zone with extended juvenile curfew hours in an area covered by, or adjacent to the area covered by, the organization.\nThe petition must be approved by a formal vote of the members of the ANC, or the members of the BID or Main Street board of directors.\nFor more information on submitting a petition, please visit this form.\nDoes the curfew law apply to non-District residents?\nYes. The curfew law applies to all persons age 17 and under who are in the District of Columbia during curfew hours. This includes both District residents as well as young people who reside elsewhere.\nWhat are the penalties for violating the law?\nA parent or legal guardian of a juvenile age 17 and under commits an offense if he or she knowingly permits, or by insufficient control allows, a minor to violate the curfew law. Any adult who violates the Juvenile Curfew Act is subject to a fine not to exceed $500 or community service. A minor who violates curfew may be ordered to perform up to 25 hours of community service.\nPersons age 17 and under are exempt from curfew if they:\n- Accompany a parent or guardian\n- Complete an errand at the direction of a parent or guardian, without detour or stop\n- Ride in a motor vehicle involved in interstate travel\n- Work or return home from a job, without detour or stop\n- Become involved in an emergency\n- Stand on a sidewalk that joins their residence or the residence of a next-door neighbor, if the neighbor did not complain to police\n- Attend an official school, religious, or other recreational activity sponsored by the District of Columbia, a civic organization, or other similar group that takes responsibility for the juvenile (this includes traveling to and from the activity)\n- Exercise their First Amendment rights protected by the US Constitution, including the free exercise of speech, religion, and right of assembly\nIs a Curfew Law Constitutional?\nPassed in 1995, The Juvenile Curfew Act of 1995 (DC Code 2-1541 et. seq.) was set up to protect the health and safety of young people and our communities. After the law was challenged in court, MPD stopped enforcement until the court decided whether the law was constitutional. In June 1999, the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia found the law to be constitutional. The District began enforcing the law again in the fall of 1999.\nAdditional Resources\nFor more information on programs and safety tips for young people, visit:\n- Safe Summer DC\n- DC Department of Parks and Recreation Summer Programs\n- Mayor Marion S, Barry Summer Youth Employment Program\n- National Crime Prevention Council Online Resource Center"

      "text": "There were 22,380 homicides in the US in 2023 \u2014 an average of 6.8 deaths per 100,000 people (the homicide rate). Over half (53.7%) occurred in major metropolitan areas with populations over 1 million.\nWhile the national homicide rate has decreased (-9.1%) since 2022, many counties and metro areas have seen numbers climb. Notably, Washington, DC (District of Columbia) has experienced a 42.4% increase in its homicide rate since last year.\nWhy are we talking about counties?\nThe most geographically granular homicide data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is county-level, which means that we have to approximate city homicide numbers from county data. Some counties map to a single city; their data is the most straightforward. Others contain multiple cities or a broader metropolitan area. This data is less exact, but still instructive.\nWhich counties have cities with the most homicides?\nCook County, the largest county in the Chicago metropolitan area, had 805 homicides \u2014 the most in the nation. The second highest total was Los Angeles County in the Los Angeles, California metro area, with 659 homicides.\nSubscribe to get unbiased, data-driven insights sent to your inbox weekly.\nWhich large cities have the highest homicide rates?\nThe top five homicide rates among large population centers \u2014 those with more than a million residents \u2014 were the cities of:\n- Memphis, Tennessee (Shelby County)\n- St. Louis, Missouri (St. Louis city)\n- Baltimore, Maryland (Baltimore city)\n- Washington, DC, (District of Columbia, DC)\n- Birmingham, Alabama (Jefferson County).\nIn large, urban municipalities with 20 or fewer reported murders, the rates are considered unreliable. In 2023, this applied to 45 counties nationwide.\nWhich smaller cities have the highest homicide rates?\nSome less-populated urban counties also have higher-than-average homicide rates, particularly in the Southeast. The five cities with the highest rates were:\n- Jackson, Mississippi (Hinds County)\n- New Orleans, Louisiana (Orleans Parish)\n- Little Rock, Arkansas (Pulaski County)\n- Baton Rouge, Louisiana (East Baton Rouge Parish)\n- August, Georgia (Richmond County\nWhich cities have rising murder rates?\nFrom 2018 to 2023, murder rates rose in 71 of the 97 metro area counties with reliable data.\nThe biggest change was in Shelby County, Tennessee, home to Memphis, where the homicide rate grew by 16.6 homicides per 100,000,. Rates grew by more than 10 homicides per 100,000 in both Washington, DC, and St. Clair County, Illinois, part of the St. Louis metro area.\nMurder rates didn\u2019t rise in every county \u2014 they remained stable in four counties, and fell in 22. Baltimore city, Maryland (-6.9 homicides per 100,000 people); St. Louis city, Missouri (-6.3) and Essex County, New Jersey in the New York metro area (-4.9) were the most improved.\nDiscover data on the US crime rate, what type of property crimes are rising, and get crime data delivered to your inbox by signing up for our weekly newsletter.\nKeep exploring\nPage sources and methodology\nAll of the data on the page was sourced directly from government agencies.
