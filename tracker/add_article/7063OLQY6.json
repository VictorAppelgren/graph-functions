      "summary": "The Senior Citizens League is advocating for a one-time $1,400 catch-up payment for Social Security beneficiaries to help them cope with rising inflation, which many seniors feel is not accurately reflected in current cost-of-living adjustments (COLA). A recent survey indicated that nearly 80% of seniors believe inflation was higher than reported, and many are dissatisfied with their Social Security benefits. The proposal aims to provide immediate financial relief, especially for the 7.3 million seniors living on less than $1,000 a month, while also calling for a reevaluation of how COLA is calculated to better reflect the economic realities faced by older Americans.",
