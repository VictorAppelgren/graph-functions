      "summary": "Gemini Space Station Inc. plans to list on Nasdaq under GEMI, but its S‑1 shows widening losses: a $158.5 million net loss on $142.2 million revenue in 2024 and a $282.5 million loss on $67.9 million revenue in the first half of 2025. The article highlights a surge in crypto IPO activity, noting Circle’s $1.1 billion offering that saw its shares jump 168% on debut and a market cap of $16.7 billion, and Bullish’s $1.1 billion IPO that more than doubled its price. These strong first‑day performances reflect growing investor appetite for crypto and stablecoin companies amid a more favorable regulatory environment. The piece also mentions other upcoming IPOs such as Omada Health and Chime, underscoring a broader trend of crypto firms turning to public markets as conditions improve.",
