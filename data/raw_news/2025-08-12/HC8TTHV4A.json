It can be perceived as something else because of how much it is talked about and how much we are tracked whenever we do go out, but I would say that it\u2019s as normal of \u2026 It happened very organically even though from a media standpoint it was being tracked. It still happened very organically.\u201d\nFollow Taylor Swift live updates from Page Six for the latest news, photos, fan theories and more\nThe three-time Super Bowl champion, 35, was first linked to Swift, also 35, in the summer of 2023, when he expressed interest in connecting with her at an Eras Tour stop in Kansas City, hoping to pass along a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it.\nSwift, who had been touring throughout the US that year, made her first Chiefs appearance in September 2023, and fans \u2014 not to mention the dads, Brads and Chads \u2014 have not been the same since.\nKelce joined Swift on tour during the 2024 offseason, even making his Eras Tour debut in Europe, while the 14-time Grammy winner has attended various Chiefs games, including their Super Bowl 2025 loss to the Eagles in February.\nDespite the heightened attention on their every move, at the end of the day, Kelce says, he and Swift are simply two regular people.\n\u201cNothing I\u2019ve ever done has been a controlled, organized process,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I say it was so organic, we fell in love just based off the people we were sitting in a room together with. We are two fun-loving people who have the morals to appreciate everyone for who they are. We share all those values. It just kind of took the f\u2013k off.\u201d\nSwift, who spent the offseason with Kelce as he prepares for his 13th season in the league, even made a pitstop on his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast to tease her upcoming 12th studio album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl.\u201d"

It was really nice to meet ya \ud83e\udd1d Never take for granted that many of my best friends are the ones I met in elementary school,\u201d Balionis, 39, captioned the Saturday post. \u201cTo take this trip with them\u2026 well I think 5th grade us would be really proud of how far we\u2019ve come, and that we continue to choose to do it together \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f also shoutout to the guys for marrying the most fun partners \ud83e\udee1.\u201d\nBalionis looked stunning in a white bikini as she enjoyed a coconut cocktail under the sun.\nOther images spotlighted group dinners, sightseeing and partying in fluorescent-lit clubs.\nBalionis took some well-deserved time off after 19 weeks on the road with \u201cGolf on CBS.\u201d\nLast week, she shared a tribute to her broadcast team, including photos from the season.\n\u201cHard to put into words what 19 weeks on the road really looks like,\u201d Balionis wrote. \u201cFor us announcers, we have it easy \u2014 we show up to work with hotel rooms already booked, everything we need waiting at check-in. Our headsets and mics work flawlessly, our sets are stocked, and our camera operators have been setting the scene for days.\u201d\nBalionis made headlines off the course last May when a Daily Mail report linked her and McIlroy after he filed for divorce from his wife of seven years, Erica Stoll.\nMcIlroy, 36, and Stoll have since reunited, and his divorce petition was voluntarily dismissed.\nFans noticed Balionis wasn\u2019t wearing her wedding ring last February while covering the Genesis Invitational.\nBalionis married former North Carolina quarterback Bryn Renner, who also had a brief career in the NFL, in 2022.\nBalionis, who wasn\u2019t wearing her ring in the Ibiza photos, has not publicly addressed speculation about a divorce, but Renner no longer appears on her social media pages.\nUs Weekly confirmed last spring that Balinois and the reigning Masters champ \u201care not dating and only have a professional relationship.\u201d\nBalionis joined CBS Sports in 2017 as a golf reporter and also serves as a sideline reporter for select NFL ON CBS games and CBS Sports Network college football games."

      "text": "A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island\u2019s coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse.\nAccording to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani\u2019s agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal.\n\u201cBalelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani\u2019s promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs\u2019 role in the project \u2014 for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,\u201d the lawsuit claims.\nThe suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture.\nA spokesman for Balelo\u2019s agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful.\n\u201cThis case is about abuse of power,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cDefendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.\n\u201cDefendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants\u2019 misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all \u2014 celebrity or not.\u201d\nOhtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team.\nA five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series.\nInvestment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn.\nIt called Ohtani \u201cJapan\u2019s Babe Ruth\u201d and the \u201c1st Resident,\u201d giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, \u201cone of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,\u201d Hapuna Beach, \u201crated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler\u201d and two golf courses \u2013 one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr.\n\u201cOhtani will act as the celebrity spokesperson for the project and has committed to purchasing one of the 14 residences within the project,\u201d the brochure says. \u201cHe also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training.\u201d\nThe suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and \u201cas part of a bold marketing strategy\u201d signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, \u201cone of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable.\u201d\n\u201cThis partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project,\u201d the investment brochure said. \u201cWe see Shohei Ohtani\u2019s homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives.\u201d\nThe suit said Balelo \u201cquickly became a disruptive force,\u201d threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren\u2019t made.\n\u201cKingsbarn began capitulating to Balelo\u2019s every whim,\u201d the suit said. \u201cOver time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with Otani than honoring its obligations to its business partners.\u201d\nLast month, in what the suit called \u201ca coordinated ambush,\u201d Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto.\n\u201cKingsbarn openly admitted during the call that Balelo had demanded the terminations and that they were being done solely to placate him,\u201d the suit said. \u201cPlaintiffs stand to lose millions of dollars in compensation tied to projected homebuilding profit, construction management fees, and broker commissions.\u201d"
