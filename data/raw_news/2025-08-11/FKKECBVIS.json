  "content": "Right now, my two teenage sons are off with my husband on their fifth annual boys' lake trip \u2014 a tradition that started a few years ago when I casually suggested they take a getaway without me. It was right after the height of the pandemic, and we were all in need of some breathing room after a year of virtual school and working from home.At first, my staying behind was a practical choice: our pet sitter was unavailable and boarding wasn't an option with two dogs, a cat, and a parrot.That first year, I felt a mix of guilt and anxiety as they drove away. I'd pitched the idea as a chance for them to bond \u2014 father and sons, no \"default parent\" hovering \u2014 and I meant it. But once they actually left, I had a pit in my stomach. Had I made a terrible mistake?I was a little panicked that first year and didn't know how to fill my alone time. I started a to-do list that morphed into a massive, over-ambitious three-page document. I can't help but laugh at myself now \u2014 I'm a former Navy spouse who used to spend months alone at a time. But after a decade of parenting, I had forgotten what it was like to truly be alone in my own house.When my family was getting ready for their first trip without me, I double-checked their packing lists, tucked snacks and notes into backpacks, and offered advice on what to bring. My husband \u2014 the Navy guy I trust completely and who's more than capable of organizing a weeklong trip \u2014 definitely didn't need my help. He still patiently indulged my anxiety attack as I tucked children's Motrin, Band-Aids, and antibiotic cream into his toiletries bag.After that first year, I gradually stopped feeling the need to double-check their packing or toss out last-minute reminders about sunscreen and underwear. My kids are teenagers now, and with the help of their father (not me!), they have the planning and packing down. This year, I was content to watch from the sidelines as they loaded the car with all of the gear they'd need for a week away. The morning they left, I waved from the porch and headed back inside to a quiet house. I've learned to let go.For them, this week is about swimming, fishing, eating junk food, and staying up late watching movies. It's exactly the kind of memory-making experience that doesn't require my involvement \u2014 and honestly, they probably benefit from my absence. They come home sunburned and tired, full of stories that don't include me. They've found a place that belongs to the three of them, and rather than being jealous, I love the memories \u2014 and confidence \u2014 they're building.Meanwhile, I get a stretch of time that's entirely my own. In previous years, I've hosted girls' night on my deck or invited a long-distance friend to visit for a few days. This year, I was craving the alone time to focus on some big creative projects. I also binged some shows, read two novels, and reveled in the quiet (and a clean house).As a night owl, I find it liberating not to have to sync up with anyone else's schedule. I eat when I'm hungry rather than at designated family meal times, go to bed as late as I want, and start my day whenever I'm ready. I feel like a teenager with the house to myself while my parents are out of town \u2014 only better, because I don't have to sneak anything.After five years of trips, my to-do lists have gotten a little shorter (and focus more on fun), and I've started looking forward to this week almost as much as my family does. I can't wait to see what next year brings.",
