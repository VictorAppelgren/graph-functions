      "title": "Appfigures: ChatGPT app sees a 673% increase in global revenue",
      "summary": "Appfigures’ latest analysis shows ChatGPT’s mobile app has generated $2 billion in global consumer spending since its May 2023 launch, a 673 % year‑over‑year jump and 53 times the revenue of its nearest rival, Grok. The app has been downloaded 318 million times this year, with India leading installs (13.7 %) and the U.S. driving nearly 40 % of revenue at an average $10 per download. ChatGPT also tops competitors in lifetime revenue per install ($2.91 vs. Claude’s $2.55, Grok’s $0.75, Copilot’s $0.27), while Grok’s later mobile launch explains its lower earnings. Elon Musk’s recent accusations that Apple unfairly promotes ChatGPT were quickly refuted, and the data underscores the app’s dominance in the App Store charts.",
