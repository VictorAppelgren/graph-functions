  "description": "The lawsuit alleged that a former sensor systems architect in the Apple Watch team 'conspired to steal Apple's trade secrets relating to Apple Watch and disclose them to his new employers, OPPO and InnoPeak.'",
  "content": "Don't miss out on our latest stories. as a preferred source on Google.\n\nApple is suing a former member of the Apple Watch team for allegedly sharing trade secrets with Chinese consumer tech rival OPPO.\n\nAccording to the suit, first spotted by MacRumors, Dr. Chen Shi, a former sensor systems architect on the Apple Watch team, \u201cconspired to steal Apple\u2019s trade secrets relating to Apple Watch and disclose them to his new employers, OPPO and InnoPeak.\u201d\n\nDr. Shi is accused of downloading 63 confidential documents from Apple\u2019s systems onto one of his personal USB drives. The engineer, who spent five years at the company, is also accused of lying about the nature of his departure, saying he was set to return to China to provide care to elderly parents, instead of taking up his new position at OPPO. In addition, Shi allegedly set up and attended \u201cdozens of one-on-one meetings with Apple Watch technical team members,\u201d where he learned about their ongoing research and development efforts, including work on optical sensors, temperature sensors, and ECG sensors.\n\nApple\u2019s lawyers also allege that Shi was fully aware of the illegal nature of his alleged activities, reportedly searching \u201chow to wipe out [a] MacBook.\u201d In the middle of downloading information from Apple\u2019s shared drives, Dr. Shi reportedly searched, \u201cCan somebody see if I\u2019ve opened a file on a shared drive?\u201d\n\nOPPO has denied Apple's claims.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the recent lawsuit filed by Apple in California and have carefully reviewed the allegations in Apple\u2019s complaint,\u201d OPPO said in an official statement shared with MacRumors. \u201cWe have found no evidence establishing any connection between these allegations and the employee\u2019s conduct during his employment at OPPO.\u201d\n\nThe US technology sector has been on guard about these types of insider-information leaks for the best part of a decade. In 2020, John Demers, who served as US Assistant Attorney General for National Security, told the RSA Conference that \u201cWe see [trade secret theft] more and more manifesting itself from the insider threat.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s insider-information theft allegations have resulted in federal charges in the past. In March 2023, a federal grand jury indicted and later charged a former Apple employee in connection with the now-defunct Apple Car project, alleging he stole trade secrets relating to autonomous systems.",

      "text": "Former Apple engineer charged with stealing autonomous car tech trade secrets\nWeibao Wang fled the U.S. in 2018, has reportedly worked for Chinese EV company since\nThe U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday it has charged a former Apple Inc. engineer with attempting to steal the firm's technology related to autonomous systems, including self-driving cars, and then fleeing to China.\nThe case was among five announced on Tuesday aimed at countering efforts to illicitly acquire American technology by nations including Russia and China. The actions were the first announced by a \"strike force\" formed in February in part to keep sensitive technologies away from foreign adversaries.\nThe former Apple engineer, identified as 35-year-old Weibao Wang, formerly resided in Mountain View, Calif., and was hired by Apple in 2016, according to an April indictment unsealed on Tuesday.\nIn 2017, he accepted a U.S.-based job with a Chinese company working to develop self-driving cars before resigning from Apple, but waited about four months before informing Apple of his new job, according to the indictment.\nAfter his last day at Apple, the company discovered that he had accessed large amounts of proprietary data in the days before his departure, the U.S. Justice Department said.\nFederal agents searched his home in June 2018 and found \"large quantities\" of data from Apple, it said. The same night the search was conducted, Wang was able to fly from San Francisco International Airport to Guangzhou, China, on a one-way ticket.\nThe Justice Department said in a statement that Wang is alleged to have stolen, or attempted to, six categories of trade secrets. Each carries a maximum statutory sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 US fine.\nThe department did not identify the company who offered the job to Wang. He has been identified in media reports since leaving the U.S. as the head of automated driving at Jidu, an EV venture controlled by Baidu and co-funded by Chinese automaker Geely.\nProject Titan long in the works\nApple's automotive efforts, known as Project Titan, have proceeded unevenly since 2014, when the company first started to design a vehicle from scratch. A December report said Apple had postponed the car's planned launch. Reports filed with the state of California show Apple is testing vehicles on the state's roads.\nApple declined to comment on the case.\n\"We stand vigilant in enforcing U.S. laws to stop the flow of sensitive technologies to our foreign adversaries,\" Matt Olsen, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, said at a news conference. \"We are committed to doing all we can to prevent these advanced tools from falling into the hands of foreign adversaries.\"\nDeputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, the department's No. 2 official, said in February that the \"strike force\" was a joint effort with the U.S. Commerce Department to safeguard American technology from foreign adversaries and other national security threats. Monaco said at the time that the United States would \"strike back against adversaries trying to siphon off our most advanced technology, and to attack tomorrow's national security threats today.\"\nTwo of the cases announced Tuesday involved dismantling alleged procurement networks created to help the Russian military and intelligence services obtain sensitive technology. Two cases, including Wang's, were tied to former software engineers allegedly stealing source code from U.S. technology companies to market it to Chinese competitors.\nThe fifth case involved a Chinese network created to provide Iran with materials used in weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles.\nThe Commerce Department last year imposed new export controls on advanced computing and semiconductor components in a manoeuvre designed to prevent China from acquiring certain chips.\nWith files from CBC News"

      "text": "Press Release\nFormer Apple Employee Charged With Theft Of Trade Secrets\nFor Immediate Release\nU.S. Attorney's Office, Northern District of California\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 A federal grand jury indicted former Apple Incorporated (Apple) employee Weibao Wang, charging him with theft and attempted theft of trade secrets in connection with a scheme to access, download, and steal Apple technology related to autonomous systems, announced United States Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey and FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert K. Tripp.\nAccording to the indictment, Apple hired Wang, 35, formerly of Mountain View, Calif., to work as a software engineer beginning in March of 2016. The indictment describes how Wang signed a confidentiality agreement with Apple. The indictment further states that Apple provided Wang with in-person secrecy training that covered the appropriate handling of confidential material, and established rules prohibiting the transfer and transmission of the company\u2019s intellectual property without Apple\u2019s consent. Wang was assigned to work with a team at Apple that designed and developed hardware and software for autonomous systems, which can have a variety of applications, such as self-driving cars.\n\u201cInnovation is alive and well in Silicon Valley\u2014indeed, throughout the Northern District of California,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ramsey. \u201cUnfortunately, there will always be some who cheat the system by stealing and profiting from the fruits of others\u2019 labor. The Wang prosecution is but one example. We are pleased that the Disruptive Technology Task Force renews energy and focus on securing innovation for those who actually create it.\u201d\n\u201cThe protection of intellectual property rights is crucial to the economic security of our region, which is home to world-renowned ingenuity and innovation,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Tripp. \u201cThe FBI is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to pursue individuals who cut corners by using deceptive and illegal methods to obstruct law enforcement investigations and benefit themselves.\u201d\nAccording to the indictment, in November of 2017, a little more than two and a half years after being granted access to a range of Apple\u2019s sensitive materials, Wang signed a letter accepting an offer of full-time employment as a Staff Engineer with the U.S.-based subsidiary of a company headquartered in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The parent company is described in the indictment as \u201cCOMPANY ONE\u201d and allegedly was working to develop self-driving cars. The indictment alleges Wang waited more than four months after signing the new employment agreement before informing Apple that he was resigning.\nAfter Wang\u2019s last day at Apple on April 16, 2018, Apple representatives reviewed access logs documenting historical activity on Apple\u2019s network. Apple identified Wang as having accessed large amounts of sensitive proprietary and confidential information in the days leading up to his departure from Apple.\nThe indictment describes the June 27, 2018, search by law enforcement of Wang\u2019s Mountain View residence and the discovery of large quantities of data taken from Apple prior to his departure. Wang was present during the search and told agents he had no plans to travel. Nevertheless, Wang purchased a one-way plane ticket from San Francisco International Airport to Guangzhou, China, and boarded a flight that night. Through subsequent investigation, law enforcement determined that Wang accessed Apple\u2019s proprietary and confidential information after leaving Apple, during the period in which he was employed by the subsidiary of COMPANY ONE.\nThe indictment describes six categories of trade secrets that Wang allegedly stole, or attempted to steal, and charges him with one count of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1832(a)(1),(2),(3), & (4) for each category as follows:\n|\nCount |\nDate |\nItem Description |\n|---|---|---|\n|\nOne |\nOn or about August 11, 2016 |\nEntire Autonomy Source Code |\n|\nTwo |\nOn or about April 18, 2018 |\nTracking for an Autonomous System |\n|\nThree |\nOn or about April 15, 2018 |\nBehavior Planner for an Autonomous System |\n|\nFour |\nOn or about April 14, 2018 |\nArchitecture Design for an Autonomous System |\n|\nFive |\nIn or about April 2018 |\nDescriptions of Hardware Systems, Including Architecture, Modules, Power, and Inputs |\n|\nSix |\nOn or about April 15, 2018 |\nMotion Planner for an Autonomous System |\nAn indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. Wang faces a maximum statutory sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine in the amount of $250,000 (or twice the gross gain or loss resulting from the scheme) for each count of theft or attempted theft of trade secrets. As part of any sentence following conviction, the court also may order a term of supervised release, fines or other assessments, restitution, and forfeiture, if appropriate. However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.\nThe Special Prosecutions Section of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California is prosecuting the case. The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nUpdated May 16, 2023\nComponent"
