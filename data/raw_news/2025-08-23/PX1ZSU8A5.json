  "title": "NordVPN vs PrivateVPN 2025: Which VPN Is Best for You?",
  "description": "Read our NordVPN vs PrivateVPN comparison and find out which VPN is better overall. Here's more info on PrivateVPN vs NordVPN.",
  "content": "Our NordVPN vs PrivateVPN comparison explains everything you need to know about these providers. In short, both VPNs are safe to use, don\u2019t store logs, and offer applications for all devices. However, after an in-depth assessment, we ultimately liked NordVPN more in 2025.\n\nDespite the outcome, we think PrivateVPN is a decent low-cost option, albeit with a few caveats explained in today\u2019s PrivateVPN vs NordVPN comparison. We performed eight tests and declared the winner at the end of each. Our results are below, so keep reading for more information.\n\nNordVPN is widely compatible with all devices, including routers, gaming consoles, Smart TVs, and even Apple TV, for which it offers a native client. PrivateVPN, despite being a lot smaller VPN, still provides excellent applications for popular and less popular systems.\n\nWe found that NordVPN\u2019s router compatibility is superior overall; however, the difference is negligible. For those interested, both VPNs can be used with Kodi, and you can even equip your Linux computer without a GUI, alas. So what about simultaneous connections?\n\nDuring our PrivateVPN vs NordVPN comparison, we found that:\n\nOn the compatibility front, these VPNs seem to stand shoulder to shoulder.\n\nAre They Easy to Use?\n\nSo, what about ease of use then? Is PrivateVPN better than NordVPN, or is it the opposite?\n\nIt\u2019s a nice-looking app with a beautiful world map and settings on the left side. NordVPN feels snappy and premium. Click on the country you want, and it\u2019ll connect in two seconds. The left-hand sidebar lets you access all fundamental settings and features for convenience.\n\nThe Settings menu is intuitive and lets you easily enable a kill switch, change your protocol, and tweak other options. NordVPN\u2019s design philosophy remains consistent across all devices, so switching from a computer to your phone or tablet will always feel seamless.\n\nIt looks more \u201cbarbaric\u201d than NordVPN, but after testing it, we must say it\u2019s polished and smooth. Connection times are pretty short; you can always connect with a click. Menus on the left provide access to all of PrivateVPN\u2019s features, and if you want, you can switch to a simple view, which simplifies the app.\n\nPrivateVPN\u2019s design transfers to mobile devices, where the app looks identical and even offers similar features. Like NordVPN, PrivateVPN feels premium and snappy enough, as it works reliably and without bugs.\n\nOur next PrivateVPN vs NordVPN comparison takes us to the pricing round.\n\nYou may be wondering how much a VPN is, and above everything, how much you\u2019ll spend on NordVPN or PrivateVPN, depending on your decision. Let us jump right in if this is the primary factor behind your decision-making process. We\u2019ll start with NordVPN, which costs this much:\n\nThe cheapest Basic plan costs $3.00 to $3.50 monthly, depending on the current promotion. The Plus plan is roughly $4.00, and it is the most popular option. The Complete plan is about $5.00 and includes NordLocker.\n\nGet the Best Discount on NordVPN\n\nThese are biennial plans that sometimes offer three extra months. As these are introductory prices, NordVPN\u2019s renewal costs are higher. After the first two years, all plans are renewed annually. Speaking of annual renewals, NordVPN offers annual plans at higher prices.\n\nYou can refer to our NordVPN pricing guide for more information.\n\nPrivateVPN promotes its 36-month plan at $2.00 monthly. It\u2019s only $72 for the first three years, making it a fantastic value. After that, it\u2019s renewed at $72 every 12 months, which is about $6 monthly. PrivateVPN\u2019s renewal cost is cheaper than NordVPN\u2019s, and it offers a 30-day money-back guarantee (like NordVPN).\n\nThis is precisely where we\u2019ll prove it.\n\nNordVPN is famous for delivering innovative security solutions by inventing in-house protocols and features that other providers lack. PrivateVPN\u2026 not so much. It\u2019s more of a run-of-the-mill VPN in comparison.\n\nDespite that, these VPNs have a few similarities that we\u2019d like to address in this duel:\n\nEven these similarities can be broken down into more minor differences.\n\nFor instance, both VPNs use GCM encryption, which we prefer over AES, but PrivateVPN allows you to choose 128-bit. In theory, it should provide better performance, but this isn\u2019t the case in practice.\n\nBoth VPNs have IKEv2 and OpenVPN protocols, but also support WireGuard.\n\nThe difference is in their implementation. NordVPN uses NordLynx, an improved version of WireGuard. Meanwhile, PrivateVPN relies on the \u201cvanilla\u201d version. Regarding obfuscation, PrivateVPN uses Stealth VPN, which masks your VPN traffic, ensuring it looks like a regular one.\n\nNordVPN does the same with its obfuscated servers. In our NordVPN vs PrivateVPN test, we found that its obfuscated servers are a tad more effective. More about that later.\n\nFinally, both providers offer advanced kill switches that can work on the system level or be applied to specific applications. We explained how a kill switch works here, but PrivateVPN and NordVPN took our definition to another level by extending their kill switch capabilities.\n\nMany differences exist between PrivateVPN and NordVPN. Unfortunately for the former, they are reflected in NordVPN\u2019s advanced features, which are lacking in PrivateVPN.\n\u2022 Split tunnelling, which PrivateVPN still lacks in 2025\n\u2022 Double VPN for doubling your encryption and improving security\n\u2022 Dark Web Monitor for alerts about leaked personal data or passwords\n\u2022 Meshnet for file sharing, remote control, and more.\n\nPrivateVPN offers nothing similar. Plus, its servers aren\u2019t based on RAM like NordVPN\u2019s, which explains its inferior performance in our speed tests below.\n\nWe should remember that PrivateVPN is much cheaper, but Surfshark, at a similar price, offers many NordVPN-like features. In a separate duel, we compared Surfshark to NordVPN and found that they\u2019re very comparable security-wise despite the obvious price difference.\n\nSadly, that cannot be said about PrivateVPN.\n\nPrivateVPN is worthy of its name, as it offers impeccable privacy through its proven no-logging practices. NordVPN\u2019s name bears no similar significance, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s unsafe. Our comparison between PrivateVPN and NordVPN showed the opposite: they\u2019re both no-logging VPN services!\n\nPrivateVPN operates from Sweden, while NordVPN is in Panama.\n\nInspecting their privacy policies reveals that neither stores sensitive data. By sensitive data, we refer to your IP address, browsing history, original location, connection metadata, etc. They store a minimal amount of data necessary for maintenance and server operation.\n\nThe problem with PrivateVPN is the lack of third-party audits.\n\nOn the other hand, we have NordVPN, which has a few from PwC and Deloitte. This instantly makes it more trustworthy, primarily because audits mainly focused on its no-log policy and security features.\n\nIf you\u2019re afraid of PrivateVPN\u2019s lack of audits, don\u2019t be. Many \u201cnon-audited\u201d VPNs exist (PrivadoVPN, for example) and are famous for being safe and secure. However, audits cost money, and smaller VPN companies likely can\u2019t afford them, which explains why they lack them.\n\nWhich VPN Is Faster: NordVPN or PrivateVPN?\n\nShould you pick NordVPN or PrivateVPN if speed is your primary concern? We\u2019d say NordVPN, but let\u2019s elaborate on that. Before we move on, let\u2019s set a reference point: our non-VPN internet speed. At the time of writing, we were in Eastern Europe with these connection speed parameters:\n\nOur test emphasised more distant servers to push the boundaries of both VPNs.\n\nTo make our test more accurate, we performed it three times a day, three days in a row, using three server locations: the UK, the USA, and Japan. We also stuck to their fastest protocols, such as NordLynx in NordVPN and WireGuard in PrivateVPN.\n\nAll tests were performed on our Windows 11 desktop computer with the latest version of network adapter drivers.\n\nOkay, so the first table displays the speed retention rate, which is higher in NordVPN.\n\nWe used the best results to make this comparison. Speaking of the best results, we wanted to give this duel more context by displaying the actual speed test results, so here they are:\n\nOur detailed NordVPN review highlighted its streaming prowess as one of its key aspects. Torrenting was also included because of its special P2P servers. It\u2019s clear that PrivateVPN has to fight an uphill battle, but let\u2019s see how well it holds up against its foe in 2025.\n\nWe won\u2019t lie: NordVPN was better for streaming.\n\nWe tested over twenty Netflix libraries, including the most popular, and NordVPN unblocks them all without a hitch. Interestingly, the VPN has an exciting browser extension with location spoofing, which aids streaming through Firefox, Chrome, Brave, and other supported browsers.\n\nMoreover, including Smart DNS helps unblock US-based streaming services on various devices.\n\nNordVPN\u2019s streaming prowess goes far beyond Netflix. You can also enjoy Hotstar, Max, Prime Video, foreign TV channels, and more. There\u2019s pretty much no insurmountable obstacle for this VPN.\n\nMeanwhile, PrivateVPN is a solid pick for Netflix if you stick to the most popular libraries. Experiment a bit and you\u2019ll find cracks in its \u201cstory\u201d. PrivateVPN works with BBC iPlayer, but simultaneously fails to unblock more \u201cdemanding\u201d platforms like ESPN Plus, which worked with NordVPN in our tests.\n\nDue to occasionally slower speeds, longer buffering times are typical, but they don\u2019t always break the immersion. NordVPN\u2019s superior performance and unblocking abilities result in an exceptional overall experience.\n\nThese VPNs support P2P on all servers, while NordVPN offers specialised torrenting servers. We noticed no difference between these and \u201cregular\u201d servers.\n\nAs you can see below, NordVPN works well for torrenting:\n\nIf you choose PrivateVPN, you\u2019ll get the same results:\n\nPrivateVPN offers port forwarding, which may slightly aid torrenting performance. In our tests, however, we haven\u2019t noticed any difference. NordVPN supports SOCKS5, which you can set up in your torrent client.\n\nHowever, we recommend sticking only to the VPN connection to maximise privacy and performance.\n\nThe benefits of a larger server network are usually reflected in performance and the IP address pool.\n\nIf the network is large enough, finding an uncrowded server that provides the best speed is easier. Meanwhile, a more constrained network inevitably leads to overcrowding and usually results in less convincing performance.\n\nSo, how large are their server parks?\n\u2022 PrivateVPN has around 200 servers in 63+ locations\n\nNordVPN\u2019s server count is roughly 40 times larger. The location count is about 3.5 times larger, so things are straightforward. Additionally, NordVPN has many speciality servers, such as Onion over VPN, Double VPN, and P2P. It also offers inexpensive dedicated IP addresses.\n\nYou\u2019ll say PrivateVPN also has dedicated IPs: you\u2019d be right!\n\nHowever, it uses so-called dynamic IP addresses, which means you get a unique IP with each connection, but not the same one. These IP addresses are free, but aren\u2019t better than NordVPN\u2019s traditional dedicated IP addresses.\n\nLastly, we\u2019ll repeat that NordVPN\u2019s servers are RAM-based, while PrivateVPN has yet to migrate to RAM.\n\nBypassing Censorship: Which VPN Does It Better?\n\nCan you use NordVPN and PrivateVPN in China?\n\nYes, you can, but they behave differently. PrivateVPN\u2019s StealthVPN struggles to connect, but the connection speed is drastically slower when it does. NordVPN\u2019s obfuscated servers do a slightly better job and maintain the speed, with minimal occasional losses.\n\nTo be clear, the Great Firewall successfully fights off VPNs, and most won\u2019t work as well as they used to. Therefore, expect connection issues on both sides, but less with NordVPN.\n\nWe tested PrivateVPN and NordVPN in Turkey, the UAE, and Qatar. These censored regions are known for occasional VPN blocking, but luckily, both providers were up to the task. In some instances, we didn\u2019t need to use obfuscation, but relied on regular servers without issues.\n\nNordVPN offers NordWhisper, which also helps overcome network filtering. This makes it a great VPN to use in school or any other environment where proper internet access is restricted.\n\nOur extensive tests brought us back to our initial conclusion: NordVPN is a better VPN overall.\n\nPrivateVPN took one out of eight rounds, and the rest easily went to NordVPN. The extension is a sub-round in which we compared their torrenting prowess, and PrivateVPN was on par. However, you\u2019d be crazy not to see how superior NordVPN is in every aspect.\n\nNow, we must address the pricing aspect.\n\nNordVPN isn\u2019t an expensive VPN, as the Basic plan starts at just over three quid. PrivateVPN costs 55% less for three years, but as you saw, it offers very little compared to NordVPN. We advise against picking PrivateVPN and saving money because you\u2019ll likely be disappointed.\n\nInstead, we advise exceeding your budget (if possible) and spending that extra dollar or so on NordVPN. Given the negligible price difference, NordVPN is an unbelievably better option.\n\nThis concludes our NordVPN vs. PrivateVPN comparison. We hope you\u2019ve picked your favorite by now.",

      "text": "VPNs safeguard your online privacy and security by rerouting your online traffic through an encrypted tunnel, masking and temporarily replacing your IP address in the process. As a result, they\u2019re also incredibly useful for accessing geo-blocked content. Apple TV, being a high-end streaming device, checks many boxes for a great streaming experience. However, users face the same regional restrictions as on other devices\u2014until they use a VPN for Apple TV, that is.\nA quality provider will clear the way for more entertainment options while protecting your sensitive information. That said, not all VPNs are created equal. In this article, we\u2019ll review the best VPN providers for Apple TV, highlighting their features so you can make an informed decision.\nDo You Really Need to Use a VPN on Your Apple TV?\n\u201cNeed\u201d is a strong word. You can certainly enjoy the streaming device without resorting to a VPN. But we\u2019ll let you in on a secret: if you\u2019re looking for the freedom to explore content beyond your country or region, you need a way to change your IP address. And a VPN is the most reliable approach.\nA VPN service can bypass geo-restrictions on content libraries and platforms by spoofing your location. Those digital roadblocks keep you from viewing shows, movies, and more on foreign TV channels. Streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video also employ geo-blocks to enforce licensing agreements.\nThankfully, an excellent streaming-friendly VPN clears those hassles.\nOn top of that, it will provide an extra layer of security and privacy to keep hackers, snoops, and your ISP from accessing your data. The latter is especially relevant while you\u2019re streaming with Apple TV because it prevents your ISP from throttling your connection speed.\nThe Best VPN for Apple TV: 5 Services We Recommend in 2025\nBelow, you\u2019ll find a list of the best Apple TV VPN services, per our extensive tests. To arrive at this ranking, we compared 40+ VPNs based on factors like their compatibility with Apple TV, performance, unblocking capabilities, security, and more.\nLet\u2019s jump right in.\n7492 servers\n118 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n10 simultaneous connections\n9.4 /10\n3000 servers\n105 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n8 simultaneous connections\n9.1 /10\n27000 servers\n91 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n9 /10\n3000 servers\n100 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n8.7 /10\n12000 servers\n100 covered countries\n45 days money-back guarantee\n7 simultaneous connections\n8.4 /10\n1. NordVPN\nNordVPN offers the best VPN app for Apple TV in 2025. The full-featured client lets you instantly change your IP address to enjoy streaming content curated for other audiences. Setting up is easy, and it looks even better (and is less cluttered) than the provider\u2019s desktop apps.\nBesides the Apple VPN app, NordVPN is widely compatible with apps for computers (it\u2019s the best Windows VPN according to our tests), smartphones, routers, set-top boxes, and other devices. With one subscription, you get to connect up to 10 devices directly at the same time.\nThanks to NordVPN\u2019s exceptional unblocking capabilities, you can access a wide range of geo-restricted libraries on platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, HBO Max, and more. The VPN\u2019s presence in 111 countries means there are more catalogs to choose from than virtually any other competitor.\nPlus, it comes with a massive network comprising over 6,300 servers. Not only does that mean you won\u2019t run out of connection options, but the ultra-fast servers ensure you get to enjoy bufferless streaming.\nSecurity-wise, NordVPN implements military-grade encryption to protect your data, along with an advanced kill switch and DNS leak protection. It has an obfuscation feature to disguise your traffic, and several other advanced and extra tools add extra layers of security.\nOn top of that, it won\u2019t store your connection logs on its servers, so you needn\u2019t worry about your digital presence getting exposed.\nThere\u2019s a 30-day money-back guarantee attached to every NordVPN plan that allows you to check it out risk-free.\nPros\n- Full-featured Apple TV app\n- A massive network of VPN servers\n- Multiple third-party privacy audits\n- Effortlessly bypasses geo-restrictions\n- Blazing-fast connection speeds\n- Many advanced and extra features\nCons\n- Renewal price\n- Clunky mobile user interface\n2. ExpressVPN\nExpressVPN was the first top provider to roll out a VPN for Apple TV app, only a few months after tvOS 17 came out. It\u2019s a lightweight app that works with both HD and 4K versions of the device. Its Smart DNS service, MediaStreamer, is included for enhanced viewing wherever you are.\nExpressVPN supports many other platforms, including smart TVs and streaming devices like the Amazon Fire TV Stick. You can use two fewer devices than NordVPN if you connect several simultaneously unless you extend the connection with a router.\nIt\u2019s a quality VPN for streaming, so you get to enjoy movies, TV shows, and documentaries curated for other audiences. During our tests, it instantly unblocked US TV channels from outside the country, as well as streaming services like Netflix, BBC iPlayer, and Hulu.\nExpressVPN offers more than 3,000 servers across 105 countries. They\u2019re high-performance servers, as our speed tests found, and will enable steady streams. Even if you\u2019re watching your videos in 4K.\nBest-in-class encryption masks your data from your ISP and other prying eyes. An automatic kill switch prevents accidental exposure, and the provider includes an excellent ad-blocker. Moreover, by committing to its strict no-logs policy, ExpressVPN designed its TrustedServer technology to force-wipe data on its servers with each reboot.\nExpressVPN also has a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you\u2019re not impressed, you can cancel your subscription for a full refund.\nPros\n- User-friendly Apple TV VPN application\n- Unblocks streaming services hassle-free\n- Performance-friendly servers\n- Multiple audits of no-logs policy\n- MediaStreamer for enhanced streaming\nCons\n- Expensive subscription pricing\n- Apple TV app is light on features\n3. Private Internet Access\nPIA VPN\u2019s Apple TV app opens access to a world of content, whether you\u2019re home or on a trip abroad. It\u2019s quite customizable but impressively easy to use and has light and dark modes to suit your visual preferences. The VPN also has five Smart DNS locations if you prefer that option.\nThere\u2019s wide support for several devices, including routers, gaming consoles, and smart TVs. What\u2019s more, Private Internet Access is in the small elite group of providers without a limit for simultaneous connections on one account.\nA global server network in 91 countries lets you relish online content wherever you are. PIA may struggle with formidable blocks on popular streaming services, we found. Still, you can stream a few Netflix libraries and use most geo-restricted websites.\nAs for performance, the VPN produces impressive speeds, thanks to its modern protocols and 10 Gbps ports. Even when some servers displayed high pings, we could stream online videos without pesky buffering.\nPrivate Internet Access has a US headquarters. But don\u2019t worry; it won\u2019t store any logs with digital trails that could lead back to you.\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s armed with top-notch security tools, from AES 256-bit encryption to DNS leak protection. There\u2019s also an automatic kill switch with multiple levels of customization.\nWhat if you change your mind about the VPN? As long as it\u2019s within 30 days of buying a plan, you can ask for a full refund.\nPros\n- Vast network of servers\n- Unlimited simultaneous connections\n- Verified no-logs policy and open-source apps\n- Affordable pricing\nCons\n- Inconsistent unblocking capabilities\n- Based in a Five Eyes country\n4. Surfshark\nAnother top-rated VPN for Apple TV, Surfshark, has a dedicated app available in the App Store. It also allows you to explore more technical approaches by offering router support and a Smart DNS option.\nYou can download or set up Surfshark on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, routers, and Fire TV. And get this: there\u2019s no need to ponder over what device gets protected. Surfshark removes the device limit placed by most VPNs, allowing unlimited simultaneous connections.\nIt\u2019s impressive how well Surfshark is optimized to break past geo-restrictions on websites and online services. It passed through several streaming services hassle-free during testing, including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and BBC iPlayer.\nPlus, it\u2019s pretty speedy \u2014 one of the fastest VPN services around, in fact. Surfshark\u2019s 10 Gbps ports and modern protocols ensure it maintains stable connection speeds, so expect buffer-free streaming. In addition, with 3,200+ servers in 100 countries, you can always connect to an uncrowded server nearby.\nSurfshark scrambles your data with bank-level AES-256 and ChaCha20 encryption algorithms so bad actors can\u2019t look in. It also does an excellent job of preventing DNS leaks and exposure whenever the VPN connection drops. What\u2019s more, its toolkit comes loaded with several advanced and extra features.\nYou can try Surfshark\u2019s Apple TV experience without risking your money because it offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nPros\n- Fast connection speeds\n- Capable, dedicated Apple TV VPN app\n- Optimized servers for unblocking streaming services\n- Unlimited simultaneous connections\nCons\n- Expensive monthly pricing\n- Many virtual servers hosted far from intended locations\n5. CyberGhost\nCyberGhost is the last service worth presenting to you on this list of the best VPNs compatible with Apple TV in 2025.\nBesides, its router support allows you to cover every device on your local network, including your Apple TV. It\u2019s easier to carry out with CyberGhost than with most other VPN services.\nAside from PIA, no top provider matches CyberGhost\u2019s extensive server network. It offers more than 12,000 servers across 100 countries, but there\u2019s more to it than sheer size. The VPN has categories for various activities that enhance the experience. For example, its streaming-optimized servers break past most geo-blocks hassle-free to provide access to international content on your Apple TV.\nPlus, you can expect speedy connections, especially when you use WireGuard. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the provider has no data caps or bandwidth limits to interrupt you in the middle of a TV show marathon.\nWhile you stream, CyberGhost secures your connection with virtually uncrackable encryption. It doesn\u2019t skimp on features, providing a bunch of tools, including a kill switch and protection for your device on public networks. Besides, it has nothing to hand over about your online sessions because your browsing logs aren\u2019t collected or stored.\nA six-month or longer plan gives you 45 days to make up your mind risk-free. That\u2019s longer than any other provider allows.\nPros\n- Extensive collection of servers\n- Verified no-logs policy\n- High-level collection of features\n- 45-day money-back guarantee on long-term plans\nCons\n- Pricey monthly plans\n- Limits access by device, not connection\n- Not-so-clear privacy policy\nHow to Use a VPN With Apple TV\nGetting a VPN up and running on Apple TV may require some tinkering, depending on your provider. There are a few ways to go about doing so, some easier than others. Let\u2019s go through the process for each approach.\n1. Install a VPN App Directly on Apple TV\nUntil recently, Apple TV lacked native support for VPN applications, and that limited users to more complex workarounds. Thankfully, the release of tvOS 17 in 2023 brought exciting updates, including the ability to install and use VPN apps on your Apple TV directly. As you can imagine, this straightforward method is the simplest.\nHere\u2019s how to set up a VPN app on your Apple TV. We\u2019ll demonstrate using NordVPN, the best VPN for Apple TV, but the steps are similar for other premium providers.\n- Launch the App Store on your Apple TV.\n- Search for your chosen VPN provider\u2019s app.\n- Download and install the app.\n- Create an account if you\u2019re a first-time user.\n- Log in with your VPN account credentials.\n- Connect to a server of your choice.\nWhenever you need to stream geo-restricted content, connect to a VPN server in that country, and you\u2019ll gain access. For example, if you want to watch content from an American streaming service, connect to a server located in the US to obtain a US IP address.\n2. Install a VPN on Your Router\nAlternatively, you can set the VPN up on your router if your provider doesn\u2019t have a native app yet. It\u2019s more technical, but this approach is also a good choice for broadening your VPN coverage. That way, you can protect all the devices on your local network for the price of a single subscription.\nWhat to do:\n- Enter your router\u2019s IP address (usually found in the manual or on a sticker on the device itself) into a web browser to access the admin panel.\n- Head to the VPN section of the settings.\n- Enter your VPN provider\u2019s details. You should find the required information on its website or support page.\nNote that your Apple TV has to be connected to the router\u2019s network for this method to work.\nNot all routers support VPN configurations, so check its manual (or online) to see if yours does. You\u2019re good to go if it allows installing custom firmware or has built-in VPN functionality.\n3. Use Smart DNS\nSmart DNS uses your DNS to unlock geo-restricted websites and online services. So, it\u2019s a bit like a VPN, except it doesn\u2019t encrypt your entire connection. That means you\u2019ll enjoy faster speeds because it removes the extra step in the connection process. Keep in mind, however, that your online traffic is more vulnerable.\nSome VPNs, like NordVPN, offer a Smart DNS service. Follow these steps to set it up on your Apple TV if you have a VPN with it:\n- Log into your VPN account on the provider\u2019s website.\n- Navigate to the Smart DNS settings and allowlist your IP address.\n- Back on your Apple TV, go to General, and select Network.\n- Select your Wi-Fi connection and click Configure DNS.\n- Choose Manual.\n- Enter your VPN\u2019s SmartDNS server address.\n4. Share Your VPN Connection From Your Computer\nThe final technique involves connecting your VPN to your already protected Windows or Mac computer to establish a VPN connection. This method will come in handy if your VPN doesn\u2019t have a native app and you\u2019d rather not follow the rather technical process in the previous approach.\nSet up the VPN on your computer and connect to a server. Enable internet sharing (there are different steps for Windows and Mac), then connect your Apple TV to the shared network.\nCan You Use a Free VPN for Apple TV?\nYou don\u2019t necessarily need to shell out for an expensive VPN service just because you\u2019re using a high-end streaming device. Still, going for a free one instead of a premium provider may be more trouble and frustration than it\u2019s worth.\nTo begin with, they may not even support Apple TV. We\u2019ve only come across a couple of free VPNs with an app for tvOS. And most free providers, including those two, don\u2019t offer a Smart DNS service.\nApart from that, free VPNs typically only have limited server networks. As a result, your choice of connection options is severely restricted, and you\u2019re almost always going to experience slow speeds. On top of that, most have data and bandwidth limits, and that caps how much streaming you can enjoy.\nOn the privacy side, many free VPNs sustain their operations by extensively logging and selling user data. As you can imagine, that cancels out the primary purpose of using a VPN in the first place. They may also only offer subpar or obsolete security features or lack the necessary ones to safeguard your data.\nIn essence, you need a paid VPN for Apple TV. You can use an affordable provider like NordVPN or Private Internet Access if you have a tight budget.\nFinal Words\nMost people want a virtual private network that masks their data and online sessions from hackers and other third parties. But there are other benefits, especially for cord-cutters with devices like Apple TV. A VPN will unblock geo-restrictions in the way of your entertainment so you can enjoy region-exclusive content.\nThis article highlighted the best providers that stood out in our tests. NordVPN is the best VPN for Apple TV, as it effortlessly bypasses geo-blocks and offers blazing-fast connection speeds. It\u2019s also a highly secure VPN service.\nWant to check it out? Its plan prices are not expensive, and each comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHere are the most commonly asked questions (and their answers) about using a VPN for Apple TV.\nDoes Apple TV support VPNs?\nYes, you can use a VPN with Apple TV. However, you may only install a VPN app on it if you use tvOS 17 or a later version of its operating system. For older versions, the manual configuration methods discussed in this article apply.\nIs there a VPN that works with Apple TV?\nYes. Some VPN services offer Apple TV apps you can install on the streaming service. In addition, they\u2019re compatible with routers and may allow you to unblock streaming services on your Apple TV with Smart DNS. NordVPN, ExpressVPN, PIA, Surfshark, and CyberGhost all work with Apple TV.\nWhat is the fastest VPN on Apple TV?\nNordVPN is the fastest VPN for Apple TV. Its custom NordLynx protocol, 10 Gbps servers, and a well-optimized network guarantee speedy connections without buffering. In addition, NordVPN doesn\u2019t cap your data and prevents your ISP from throttling your connections.\nHow can I change my VPN country on Apple TV?\nTo change your VPN location, launch your VPN app and connect to a server in a different country. Alternatively, you can change the settings for your router if you\u2019re using one or opt for Smart DNS. Finally, you may share the VPN connection from your computer to your Apple TV device.\nWhich VPNs have an app for Apple TV?\nVPN services are increasingly joining the Apple TV train with dedicated apps for the platform. Currently, here are the providers with Apple TV clients.\n- NordVPN\n- ExpressVPN\n- Private Internet Access\n- Surfshark\n- CyberGhost\n- IPVanish\n- PureVPN\n- Hide.me\n- Flow VPN\n- X-VPN"

      "text": "Student life is pretty challenging on its own. Having to put up with restricted Wi-Fi networks while juggling classes, assignments, and all those other extras? That can be a real headache. But, most schools and colleges mount firewalls to filter online content. Consequently, it can be difficult to source the educational content you need on sites like YouTube. Even social networks like TikTok aren\u2019t all cat videos and dance challenges. They\u2019re also valuable tools for learning. Thankfully, you can bypass that digital roadblock with the best VPN for school.\nHowever, because there are so many VPNs on the market, finding the right one for your needs isn\u2019t easy. We\u2019ve done the hard work, and in this article, we\u2019ll highlight the best VPN services to use as a student (or teacher, for that matter) while connected to your school\u2019s Wi-Fi network.\nHow to Unblock School Wi-Fi With a VPN\nA virtual private network (VPN) is easily the most reliable method to bypass firewalls and unblock your school Wi-Fi network. Don\u2019t worry; it\u2019s not as complex as it sounds.\nHere\u2019s a simple step-by-step guide to follow:\n- Choose a Reliable VPN: You want a VPN known for its strong encryption, fast speeds, and user-friendly interface. Ideally, it should come with a massive network with servers in multiple locations, including those outside your school\u2019s region. According to our tests, the most effective option is NordVPN.\n- Sign Up: Create an account with your chosen VPN provider. Most services offer various subscription plans, so pick one that fits your budget and needs.\n- Download the VPN App: Head to the download section on the VPN\u2019s website or an official app store. Most premium providers have apps for various platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. They may also offer browser extensions. Download and install the appropriate app for your device.\n- Connect to a Server: Launch the installed app and log in with your account credentials. Select a server in your country or a nearby region, for better performance. Click the \u201cConnect\u201d button to establish a secure connection.\n- Browse Freely: Congratulations, you\u2019re now free to use previously blocked websites and online services. Enjoy unrestricted access to educational resources, social media, streaming platforms, and more.\nIt goes without saying that you should be using a quality VPN service that excels at bypassing geo-restrictions, whether at school, college, or anywhere else. We\u2019ll discuss the best options below.\nThe Best VPN for School and College \u2014 Our 5 Top Picks in 2025\nYou need a VPN in school for two main reasons: to gain access to restricted websites and resources and to ensure your privacy and security while doing so. What\u2019s more, it should ideally provide fast connection speeds.\nYou cannot rely on just any VPN service to handle these tasks, as they aren\u2019t all on the same level. Below, you\u2019ll find the five VPNs we consider best for students following extensive testing. They each combine strong unblocking capabilities with excellent performance, user-friendliness, and air-tight security.\n7492 servers\n118 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n10 simultaneous connections\n9.4 /10\n3000 servers\n105 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n8 simultaneous connections\n9.1 /10\n27000 servers\n91 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n9 /10\n3000 servers\n100 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n8.7 /10\n6500 servers\n112 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n10 simultaneous connections\n8.8 /10\n1. NordVPN\nAccording to our tests and analysis, NordVPN is the best VPN for school and college because it effortlessly tackles restrictive school Wi-Fi. It excels at bypassing firewalls and other restrictions that may block your access to educational resources on various websites.\nYour school has systems in place to detect and block VPN use? No problem. NordVPN offers specialty obfuscated servers that dress your VPN traffic up as regular traffic to avoid detection. We tested them multiple times, and they worked perfectly.\nAs for security and privacy, it\u2019s feature-packed. The AES 256-bit algorithm encrypts your internet traffic, making it appear like a jumbled mess to anyone trying to snoop. The VPN also has a kill switch, DNS leak protection, ad and malware blocker, and several other advanced tools.\nWhat\u2019s more, NordVPN never tracks, collects, or shares your internet activities with third parties. That means there\u2019s no chance your online sessions can lead back to you.\nOn top of that, you needn\u2019t worry about slow connection speeds. NordVPN, the fastest VPN in 2025, offers 10 Gbps servers and excellent performance with its 8,000+ servers across 126 countries, whether you\u2019re browsing, downloading content, or streaming.\nBroad compatibility means you can install NordVPN on all major platforms. It allows as many as ten devices simultaneously, so some classmates can connect their devices to your account. Its pricing is fair compared to many others, and a 30-day money-back guarantee backs every plan.\nPros\n- Massive network of global servers\n- Lightning-fast connection speeds\n- Easily bypasses network restrictions\n- Comes with obfuscated servers\n- Multiple third-party audits\n- Excellent VPN for streaming and downloading\nCons\n- No GUI on Linux\n- The customer support cannot be reached by phone\n2. ExpressVPN\nExpressVPN is another exceptional VPN for school that lets you access the websites and online services your school network has restricted. It\u2019s so hassle-free that you don\u2019t have to keep switching servers to get through to the sites you\u2019re interested in.\nPlus, the provider offers obfuscation on all its 3,000+ servers across 105 countries. Consequently, your school cannot detect your VPN use, let alone block it.\nSeveral advanced features safeguard your traffic while you\u2019re online. ExpressVPN employs military-grade encryption, as well as an automatic kill switch and IP/DNS leak protection. A pretty effective ad blocker stops pesky ads from intruding while you\u2019re studying, and the provider blocks malicious sites.\nWhat\u2019s more, its TrustedServer technology ensures any details of your online sessions are wiped away when the servers shut down.\nExpressVPN\u2019s speeds are truly impressive, thanks to performance-friendly servers and its proprietary Lightway protocol. That translates to buffer-less streaming, and you can browse smoothly without hiccups.\nWith a user-friendly interface and apps for all major platforms (it\u2019s one of the best VPNs compatible with macOS), setting up and using ExpressVPN is straightforward, even if you\u2019re not tech-savvy. Each subscription permits up to eight devices simultaneously, enough to fit in a few other students.\nThe main downside is ExpressVPN\u2019s rather expensive plans. Still, there\u2019s a generous discount on its annual plan that students can take advantage of. There\u2019s also a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nPros\n- Feature-rich VPN service\n- Bypasses school firewalls hassle-free\n- Unblocks most streaming services\n- Blazing-fast connection speeds\n- Multiple privacy and security audits\nCons\n- Expensive pricing\n- \u201cOnly 8\u201d simultaneous device connections allowed\n3. Private Internet Access\nWhat if you could share your VPN connection with all your friends and classmates at school? Private Internet Access offers unlimited simultaneous device connections, which means that one subscription covers every device connected to the VPN.\nThere may be hiccups if you\u2019re looking to watch content on some international streaming platforms. That said, PIA will grant you easy access to most websites that your school blocks students from connecting to. It\u2019s not all bad on the streaming front either \u2014 it unlocks Netflix US and several other libraries and services.\nConnect to a PIA server, and your data is encrypted and obfuscated. As a result, neither your ISP nor the school\u2019s network administrator can see what you\u2019re browsing or streaming.\nMultiple security audits have confirmed the VPN\u2019s stance that it doesn\u2019t log any identifiable information on its servers. In addition, the feature-rich provider offers bank-level AES 256-bit encryption to scramble your data and effectively plug DNS leaks. Its advanced kill switch prevents your cover from being blown when the VPN connection drops.\nPIA\u2019s network blows away every other provider on this list, with more than 30,000 connection options across 91 countries. Combine that massive collection with 10 Gbps connections and no bandwidth limits, and you can count on smooth browsing and streaming experiences.\nIf you\u2019re not impressed by the VPN\u2019s service, its refund policy allows you to get your money back within 30 days.\nPros\n- Vast network of servers\n- Unlimited simultaneous device connections\n- Affordable subscription prices\n- Verified no-logs policy\nCons\n- Not the most visually appealing\n- Doesn\u2019t unblock some streaming services\n4. Surfshark\nFor a relatively young VPN service, Surfshark is pretty remarkable. Take its unblocking capabilities, for instance, with the provider effortlessly bypassing most network restrictions. Your school\u2019s firewalls won\u2019t stand a chance.\nOur tests have shown that the provider also beats geo-restrictions on region-exclusive websites and platforms. It\u2019s an excellent VPN for streaming, offering access to foreign libraries on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, and more.\nCamouflage Mode is its version of obfuscation and removes VPN traces from your connection. That makes it nearly impossible even to detect your VPN use.\nSurfshark offers comprehensive protection. It employs ironclad encryption and a strict no-logs policy to keep potential snoopers away. Plus, there are features like CleanWeb, which blocks ads and malware, and Multi-Hop, which routes your traffic through multiple countries for added security.\nPerformance-wise, Surfshark\u2019s 3,200+ servers across 100 countries deliver impressive speeds and reliability. It comes through with a smooth and uninterrupted service, whether you\u2019re streaming educational videos or simply browsing the web.\nSurfshark packs a ton of value into a package that\u2019s budget-friendly. Well, as long as you opt for its longer-term plans. Also, like PIA, it allows unlimited simultaneous connections, so you can protect all your devices with a single subscription.\nPros\n- Provides speedy connections\n- Cheap long-term pricing\n- Excellent unblocking capabilities\n- Unlimited simultaneous device connections\nCons\n- Expensive monthly plan\n- 9 Eyes member country jurisdiction\n5. Proton VPN\nProton is the only freemium service to earn a spot on this list. While we consider its free plan the best free VPN on the market, a paid plan makes all the difference when you need a VPN for school.\nWe especially like its Stealth protocol. Proton VPN doesn\u2019t offer obfuscation on other protocols but built Stealth from the ground up to bypass deep packet inspection (DPI) technology and other network restrictions.\nThe VPN is renowned for its strong emphasis on privacy and security. That makes sense, considering the same team behind Proton Mail developed it. Industry-standard encryption protects your data with extra layers of security in the form of advanced features like Tor over VPN. What\u2019s more, NetShield blocks ads and malware while you browse.\nProton VPN doesn\u2019t store details of your online sessions on its servers \u2014 it won\u2019t even keep metadata logs like most other services.\nIn terms of performance, you can expect speedy and stable connections. With over 5,500 servers across 91 countries, you won\u2019t run out of nearby options no matter where you are.\nProton VPN is compatible with multiple platforms and devices and permits up to 10 connections at once. If you decide the VPN isn\u2019t for you, a 30-day money-back guarantee allows you to request a full refund.\nPros\n- Free version available\n- Bypasses network restrictions and geo-blocks\n- Audited no-logs policy\nCons\n- Expensive long-term pricing\n- Free users have a limited network\nMethodology for Ranking the Best VPN for School\nA quick Google search will reveal a dizzying array of VPN services vying for your attention. Unfortunately, not all of them deliver on their promises. And sometimes, even the features they do have may not be well implemented.\nSo, we considered several crucial factors to cut through the clutter and ensure our recommendations meet your unique needs. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what we looked out for.\n- Bypassing Capability: The primary requirement of a VPN for school is to bypass restrictive networks and geo-blocks. The providers we listed can effectively evade those restrictions so you can access the resources you need.\n- Speed and Performance: Your school\u2019s firewall already slows down your internet connection. A sluggish VPN would significantly worsen things. To avoid that, we put each VPN through a speed test and prioritized those with impressive results.\n- Security and Privacy: With the firewall out of the way, your online traffic may be exposed on your school\u2019s Wi-Fi network. Our recommended services offer industry-standard and advanced features to safeguard your online activities.\n- Compatibility: Students and teachers use various devices, from computers to smartphones and tablets. The school VPNs we ranked are versatile, offering apps for a wide array of platforms.\n- Ease of Use: They\u2019re also user-friendly, which is a plus for students who aren\u2019t tech-savvy.\n- Customer Support: You need reliable customer service to answer pressing questions or when an issue pops up. Each provider on our list offers 24/7 customer support.\n- Value for Money: Students typically have tight budgets, but free VPNs may not do the job. So, we looked to find a balance between cost and quality offered.\n- Money-Back Guarantee: If a VPN\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t impress you, don\u2019t worry; you didn\u2019t throw the money away. The services on our list back their subscriptions with full refund options for unsatisfied customers.\nCan\u2019t Bypass Your School\u2019s Firewall With a VPN? Try These Quick Fixes\nEven if you\u2019re using a top-tier VPN, you might still encounter issues when trying to bypass your school\u2019s firewall. Don\u2019t worry, here are a few expert-recommended troubleshooting tips to help you regain access:\n1. Switch Servers\nYour school may have blocked the specific IP address used by your VPN server, or the server could simply be overloaded. Connecting to a different server location in your VPN app is often a quick and effective way to bypass restrictions.\n2. Clear Your Browser\u2019s Cache and Cookies\nSometimes, cached data or cookies can interfere with VPN connections and trigger blocks. Clear your cache and cookies via your browser settings and try accessing the site again.\n3. Change the VPN Protocol\nIf the problem persists, try switching to a different tunneling protocol. Most premium VPNs offer several options like OpenVPN, IKEv2, or WireGuard. You can also try proprietary protocols like NordLynx (NordVPN) or Lightway (ExpressVPN) for better performance and stealth.\n4. Enable Obfuscation Mode\nAdvanced firewalls may use Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to detect and block VPN traffic. To counter this, enable obfuscation (or \u201cstealth mode\u201d) in your VPN settings. This feature disguises VPN traffic as regular HTTPS traffic, making it much harder to detect and block.\n5. Try a Better VPN Provider\nStill stuck? The issue might be your VPN itself. Not all services are equally effective at bypassing school or university firewalls.\nSwitch to a trusted VPN known for defeating network restrictions, such as NordVPN, ExpressVPN, or Surfshark, all of which offer strong obfuscation features and extensive server networks.\nFree VPNs for School and College: Can I Use One Instead?\nWe discussed paid VPN services because, well, they are the best options for beating your school\u2019s firewalls. But free VPNs are exactly that \u2014 free. That automatically makes them alluring, especially if you\u2019re a budget-conscious student.\nHowever, we generally don\u2019t recommend using free VPNs ahead of the providers above, and for good reason.\nFor one, they typically have limited server options and can suffer from slow connection speeds due to overcrowded servers. Throw in data caps and bandwidth restrictions, and your browsing, streaming, and downloads can quickly become frustrating experiences.\nThere\u2019s more. Your school has a good reason for blocking some websites. Unfortunately, some free VPNs only offer subpar encryption and security features. They may not safeguard your data well enough when you visit dangerous sites. Plus, some providers log and sell your data to third parties to generate revenue, which completely undermines the privacy you\u2019re seeking anyway.\nSo, we recommend sticking to the premium providers up there. If pricing is a major issue, opt for an affordable VPN like NordVPN or Private Internet Access.\nFinal Words\nMany schools and colleges place restrictions on their networks to keep students and teachers focused. The idea isn\u2019t strictly wrong. Still, it can be counterproductive when you cannot access some educational resources or relax during break periods because certain websites are behind a firewall.\nThis article highlighted and discussed the best options for choosing a VPN for school. Our top choice is NordVPN, as it comes with all you need for unrestricted browsing and streaming. The best part? It\u2019s completely risk-free to try for up to 30 days.\nBypass School Blocks with NordVPN\nFAQs\nWhy do I need a VPN at school or university?\nSchools and universities often restrict access to certain websites or apps (YouTube, Reddit, gaming platforms, etc.). A VPN allows you to bypass these firewalls, protect your privacy, and secure your data on public Wi-Fi networks.\nCan a VPN unblock streaming platforms like Netflix or Spotify on school Wi-Fi?\nAbsolutely. The right VPN can help you access geo-restricted content and unblock platforms that are usually restricted on school networks, like Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, or Disney+.\nWill a VPN slow down my internet connection?\nSome VPNs may slightly reduce your speed due to encryption overhead. However, premium VPNs like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, or Private Internet Access are optimized for speed and may even improve performance on throttled school networks.\nAre free VPNs safe for use at school or university?\nMost free VPNs come with serious drawbacks: limited data, slower speeds, weak security, and invasive logging practices. For student use, it\u2019s best to stick with affordable premium VPNs that offer stronger protection and better performance.\nWill my school know if I\u2019m using a VPN?\nSchools can sometimes detect VPN traffic patterns, but they usually can\u2019t see what you\u2019re doing inside the VPN tunnel. Using obfuscated servers (offered by many top VPNs) can help hide the fact that you\u2019re using a VPN at all."

      "text": "With so many VPN options available, it can be tricky to find one that truly fits your needs. Promises of privacy, fast speeds, and unrestricted access to content are common, but the reality often varies. PrivadoVPN, based in Switzerland, has built its reputation around a strong no-logs policy and a focus on security, backed by Switzerland\u2019s strict privacy laws.\nLaunched in 2019, PrivadoVPN delivers reliable performance for streaming and browsing securely, but it does have a few limitations. Its server network is smaller compared to leading VPNs, and it lacks unique features that set it apart from competitors. Despite these drawbacks, it remains a contender as an easy-to-use VPN for those seeking security and privacy protection.\nIf you\u2019re looking to explore a new VPN option and are considering PrivadoVPN, this 2025 review will help you decide whether it meets your expectations and is worth considering among the many alternatives.\nPrivadoVPN\nPrivadoVPN offers a secure VPN that is generally quite satisfactory. However, whether it's the free or paid plan, we found it somewhat lacking when it comes to unblocking streaming platforms. Additionally, it still lacks advanced features that most of the best VPNs currently offer.\nPros\n- User-friendly app\n- Ad-blocking and protection\n- Strong encryption features\n- Unlocks Netflix libraries\n- Affordable long-term plans\n- Offers a free plan\nCons\n- Struggles with regional content\n- No optimized servers\n- Lacks live chat support\n- Comes with a few features\nPrivadoVPN Pricing: Is It Affordable?\nWhen looking for the best VPN, pricing is often one of the most critical factors. In this section, we\u2019ll break down PrivadoVPN\u2019s pricing structure, providing a clear, in-depth analysis to help you determine if it truly delivers value for your money.\nWith multiple subscription plans available, we\u2019ll examine each one closely based on our hands-on experience with various VPNs to see which plan best suits different user needs.\nPlans and Pricing\nPrivadoVPN offers three main subscription plans, each with different pricing tiers. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown:\n- Monthly Plan: $10.99/month \u2013 Ideal for short-term users but on the higher end for a VPN service.\n- 12-Month Plan: $2.99/month \u2013 Offers significant savings compared to the monthly plan and provides long-term value.\n- 24-Month Plan: $1.99/month \u2013 The most affordable option for those willing to commit for a longer period, offering the best value overall. This price brings it closer to the cheapest VPNs on the market.\nAdd-on: Available on one and two-year plans, PrivadoVPN antivirus costs an additional $1.99 per month. It provides real-time protection against malware, ransomware, and other threats, ensuring that your devices remain secure while you browse or download content.\nEach plan includes unlimited data, access to servers in 66 cities, and allows up to 10 simultaneous connections. Long-term plans clearly offer better value if you\u2019re looking for extended coverage.\nIs the PrivadoVPN Free Plan Worth It?\nWhile PrivadoVPN does offer a free plan with 10GB of data each month (which makes it a great free VPN), it\u2019s worth noting that this plan comes with limitations.\nWith the free plan, you get access to a limited number of servers, which can result in slower speeds during peak times. Plus, you also miss out on their proprietary Control Tower and additional perks that enhance usability.\nIt\u2019s a decent starting point for those who want to test the service, but the free plan is clearly not meant for heavy users or those seeking full access to all the VPN\u2019s features.\nMoney-Back Guarantee\nPrivadoVPN provides a 30-day money-back guarantee on all paid plans, which gives you a good safety net if you\u2019re unsure whether to commit. Based on our tests, the refund process seems straightforward, and we haven\u2019t come across significant reports of issues when requesting refunds.\nIt\u2019s an industry-standard policy, giving you the chance to thoroughly test the service before fully committing. On that note, if you\u2019re interested, we have an article listing the best free VPN trials.\nPayment Methods\nWhen it comes to payment options, PrivadoVPN offers several methods, including credit/debit cards, PayPal, and cryptocurrency. The addition of cryptocurrency is a plus for those prioritizing anonymity, which aligns well with the overall privacy-focused nature of VPN services.\nRenewal Costs and Considerations\nIt\u2019s important to be aware of renewal costs, as PrivadoVPN\u2019s discounted rates are for the first term only.\nAfter the initial subscription period, the renewal prices increase to their standard rates. For example, the 12-month plan will renew at a higher price once the first year is up. This is something to consider, especially if long-term affordability is a priority.\nSecurity Features: How Secure Is PrivadoVPN?\nSecurity is the core reason most people seek out a VPN. In this section, we\u2019ll review PrivadoVPN\u2019s security measures and provide an in-depth analysis of how it protects your online activity.\nWith encryption protocols and extra features, PrivadoVPN claims to offer strong protection, but how does it hold up in testing and real-world experience?\nBasic Security Features\nPrivadoVPN comes with a standard set of security features expected from any reliable VPN provider:\n- AES-256 encryption: Widely regarded as the gold standard in encryption, AES-256 scrambles your data so thoroughly that even the most sophisticated attackers can\u2019t decipher it.\n- No-logs policy: Based in Switzerland, PrivadoVPN operates under strict privacy laws, meaning it doesn\u2019t record any of your online activity, safeguarding your data from surveillance.\n- Kill switch: In the event of a VPN disconnection, the kill switch ensures that your internet connection is cut off immediately to prevent any unprotected data from leaking.\nThese foundational security features provide a good level of protection, but we need to look closer at the more advanced options PrivadoVPN offers to see how it stacks up against competitors.\nAdvanced Security Features\nWhile the basics are solid, PrivadoVPN steps up with more advanced features, which we\u2019ll analyze to see if they provide that extra layer of protection:\nIP Leak Protection\nThis feature ensures that your actual IP address is never exposed, even in situations where the VPN connection becomes unstable or weak. DNS leaks are a common vulnerability, and PrivadoVPN\u2019s leak protection is designed to prevent any accidental IP or DNS exposure.\nSmartRoute\nPrivadoVPN offers split tunneling with SmartRoute, a feature that lets you choose which apps go through the encrypted VPN tunnel and which access the internet directly. This is particularly useful for tasks like local browsing while keeping your sensitive data protected.\nIt also features an application-specific kill switch, ensuring that even if you lose your VPN connection, certain apps stop transferring data to avoid exposure. Plus, you also get the flexibility to bypass or tunnel specific websites and IPs.\nSOCKS5 Proxy\nFor those who prioritize speed over security in certain situations, PrivadoVPN provides access to a SOCKS5 proxy. This proxy hides your IP address without the need for full data encryption, offering much faster speeds, especially for torrenting and file-sharing activities.\nWhile this is handy, you can\u2019t access the SOCKS5 proxy within the app; you have to sign in to PrivadoVPN and set it up from the website.\nControl Tower\nPrivadoVPN\u2019s Control Tower feature adds an extra layer of security by blocking intrusive ads, preventing tracking, and protecting your devices from malware, ransomware, and other cyber threats. It also includes ad-blocking and threat prevention, enhancing your browsing experience and security.\nWhile this is a standard offering with most VPNs, PrivadoVPN takes a step ahead by offering Family security (Parental controls) with social media blocking support.\nHow Good is the Control Tower?\nPrivadoVPN introduces its Control Tower as a standout feature in its security arsenal. The Control Tower functions as an advanced ad blocker and threat prevention tool, designed to improve your overall browsing experience by keeping intrusive ads and malware at bay.\nControl Tower \u2013 Threat Protection\nPrivadoVPN\u2019s Control Tower offers more than basic VPN protection \u2014 it provides a comprehensive threat prevention system. This includes active malware and phishing blocking, as well as the ability to block ads and prevent ad trackers from tracking user activities.\nIn my in-depth review, we started by disabling the Control Tower feature and running an ad-block test, which unfortunately resulted in a low score of just 10%. After enabling it, the score jumped to 90%. Disabling individual options like \u2018Ads\u2019 dropped the score to 30%, proving the Control Tower\u2019s effectiveness in blocking threats.\nControl Tower \u2013 Family Security\nFamily Security is a key feature of PrivadoVPN\u2019s Control Tower, designed to restrict access to inappropriate content such as gambling sites, substance abuse platforms, and cryptocurrency-related risks.\nWe tested the Family Security feature with the Gambling option. Disabling it allowed access to betting sites while enabling it blocked access as expected. This shows PrivadoVPN\u2019s experience in keeping families safe online.\nControl Tower \u2013 Social Media\nPrivadoVPN\u2019s Control Tower also includes social media management, enabling users to block access to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok. This feature is ideal for families or anyone looking to control their social media usage.\nWhen reviewed, we performed a test of the Social Media section, specifically focusing on Instagram. With the feature disabled, YouTube was fully accessible. After enabling the option, Instagram access was blocked, proving the feature\u2019s efficiency.\nDoes PrivadoVPN Keep Logs?\nOne of the most critical factors when evaluating a VPN service is its logging policy. Since the primary purpose of using a VPN is to enhance privacy, the idea of data logging raises concerns for many users.\nIn our analysis, PrivadoVPN promotes itself as a strict \u201cno-logs\u201d service, meaning it doesn\u2019t store or track your online activities. This reassures privacy-conscious users that their browsing habits remain secure and undisclosed.\nHowever, upon closer review, PrivadoVPN\u2019s privacy policy does mention that it may collect certain non-personally identifiable data for service operation, such as connection timestamps or server performance metrics. This is fairly standard among VPN providers but might be a point of consideration for those who prioritize total anonymity.\nWhile PrivadoVPN\u2019s headquarters in Switzerland, with its strong privacy laws, provides some reassurance, it has never undergone a third-party independent audit. We found no significant red flags, but it\u2019s always a good idea to read through the privacy policy to evaluate your personal comfort level with any data collection, even if it\u2019s minimal.\nIf you ask us, we would suggest going with NordVPN or ExpressVPN, as they are independently audited and provide more detailed transparency reports.\nHow Does PrivadoVPN Perform?\nWhen testing any VPN, performance is often the key factor that determines its day-to-day usability. In our performance review, we ran PrivadoVPN through a series of tests to provide a comprehensive analysis of its capabilities.\nSpeed Tests: Performance Evaluation\nSpeed tests are the first step in reviewing a VPN\u2019s performance and understanding how it handles different tasks. In our test and analysis, we evaluated PrivadoVPN\u2019s speeds across various server locations and protocols. For comparison, our speeds were around 60Mbps before connecting to the VPN.\nRegional Servers\nIn our experience, PrivadoVPN excelled in terms of speed on nearby servers. We noticed only a minimal dip in connection speeds of around 10-20%, allowing for uninterrupted FHD \u2013 4K streaming, fast browsing, and even online gaming. It\u2019s suitable for everyday tasks, with no noticeable lag.\nLong-Distant Servers\nOn long-distance servers and countries with VPN restrictions, the speed drop became more pronounced by dropping 50-60%. While still usable for general browsing and HD streaming, other bandwidth-intensive activities experienced some buffering. This is typical for most VPNs, but PrivadoVPN maintained a stable connection, just with reduced speeds.\nProtocol Efficiency\nPrivadoVPN supports several protocols, including OpenVPN, IKEv2, and the highly efficient WireGuard. In our test, WireGuard provided the fastest speeds, particularly on long-distance servers. If you are looking to balance security and speed, WireGuard is likely the best choice, but OpenVPN remains an excellent option for those focused on security.\nHowever, the only issue we experienced was the time it took to change between protocols and servers.\nThe delay was more than 10-15 seconds, and we never experienced such issues when testing NordVPN, ExpressVPN, or Private Internet Access. If you want the best performance, you should clearly opt for one of these.\nEncryption and Leak Tests\nEncryption and leak prevention are crucial for maintaining privacy while using a VPN. PrivadoVPN secures your data with advanced encryption algorithms, ensuring it remains unreadable to anyone without proper authorization.\nTo truly assess a VPN\u2019s effectiveness, it\u2019s essential to check encryption and run leak tests that check how well your IP address, DNS requests, and other data are kept private.\nEncryption Test\nWe ran an in-depth analysis of PrivadoVPN\u2019s encryption by examining how well it secures the data being transmitted. The VPN employs the widely trusted AES-256 encryption, the highest standard in the industry.\nDuring our test, we used Wireshark to track and follow packets by setting the protocol to WireGuard, and all packets were completely encrypted. This confirms that PrivadoVPN effectively shields your data from prying eyes, ensuring your browsing and sensitive information remain secure.\nIP Leak Test\nAn IP leak occurs when your actual IP address is exposed, even when you\u2019re connected to a VPN. During our review, we ran an IP leak test on various servers using websites like ipleak.net.\nThe results were promising, with PrivadoVPN successfully masking our real IP address in every scenario, displaying only the IP address of the VPN server. This suggests that PrivadoVPN passes the IP leak test across all tested servers, whether they are nearby or long-distance.\nDNS Leak Test\nA DNS leak can expose which websites you\u2019re visiting, compromising your privacy. We tested PrivadoVPN\u2019s ability to protect DNS requests by conducting a DNS leak test on DNSleaktest.com.\nOur test confirmed that there were no DNS leaks, as all DNS requests were securely routed through PrivadoVPN\u2019s encrypted servers. This means that none of the browsing data was visible to third parties like your ISP, ensuring a private web experience.\nWebRTC Leak Test\nWebRTC is a browser-based technology that can reveal your real IP address, even while connected to a VPN. To assess PrivadoVPN\u2019s performance, we ran a WebRTC leak test on BrowserLeaks.com.\nThroughout the test, PrivadoVPN successfully blocked any WebRTC leaks, preventing our true IP from being exposed. This ensures that both your public and private IP addresses remain secure, even when using WebRTC-enabled browsers like Chrome or Firefox.\nStreaming and Torrenting Capabilities\nIf streaming or torrenting is a priority, PrivadoVPN handles both. However, while it performs admirably in most areas, some limitations could affect your experience.\nAccess Various Streaming Platforms\nIn our review, PrivadoVPN was able to unblock the most popular streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Hulu, and BBC iPlayer. We experienced minimal buffering on local servers and enjoyed HD and 4K streaming without any significant delays.\nHowever, we noticed some inconsistencies when accessing regional content, which required multiple attempts to find the right server and unblock the content (for example, when trying to access the American Netflix catalog from outside the US).\nDespite these minor issues, a little patience can overcome them, making it a decent option for general streaming needs and unblocking content.\nThat being said, if you don\u2019t want to make any compromises, it\u2019s better to turn to NordVPN, which is the best VPN for anything related to streaming.\nTorrenting is Fast and Secure\nPrivadoVPN supports torrenting across its network, offering stable speeds for P2P downloads. In our test, torrent speeds were consistent on nearby servers, and the added security features, like DNS leak protection and a kill switch, ensured that our activities remained private.\nHowever, we noticed that PrivadoVPN lacks dedicated P2P servers, a feature that some competitors provide. While this isn\u2019t a dealbreaker, it could be seen as a drawback for those who rely heavily on torrenting.\nTo avoid these limitations, it is better to pick a VPN like NordVPN that offers dedicated P2P servers. It also goes a step ahead by offering the Onion over TOR feature, which adds an extra layer of anonymity by routing your traffic through both the VPN and the Tor network.\nAre PrivadoVPN Servers Reliable?\nIn our in-depth analysis, server coverage is a critical aspect we review to determine a VPN\u2019s overall reliability. PrivadoVPN currently operates servers in 49 countries and 66 cities, strategically covering key regions such as Europe, North America, Asia, and beyond.\nWhile the server network isn\u2019t as extensive as some of the larger VPN providers, such as NordVPN, ExpressVPN, PIA or Proton VPN, it still offers a solid range of locations for general browsing, streaming, and secure connections.\nAll of PrivadoVPN\u2019s servers can support P2P traffic, making it a reliable choice for torrenting and other file-sharing activities. While there aren\u2019t any specifically dedicated P2P servers, the existing network ensures sufficient performance for these activities.\nHowever, when compared to larger VPN providers with vast server networks, the limited number of servers may result in congestion during peak times, especially in popular locations. During our test, the servers performed reliably across multiple locations, and we did not experience any significant downtime or interruptions.\nBypassing Censorship: Is It Effective?\nIn this in-depth review, we tested PrivadoVPN\u2019s ability to bypass various forms of censorship and geo-restrictions. A key use case for many VPN users is accessing content from regions where websites, streaming platforms, or apps are restricted due to local regulations or government censorship.\nPrivadoVPN performed well in regions with moderate censorship. Additionally, the VPN was able to bypass restrictions on content in countries with strict censorship, such as China or the UAE, though performance may be inconsistent due to their stricter censorship policies.\nWhile PrivadoVPN did succeed in bypassing many restrictions during our test, it doesn\u2019t offer the advanced obfuscation or stealth modes seen in NordVPN or ExpressVPN, which are specifically designed for countries with heavy surveillance and censorship, like China or Russia. This may limit its effectiveness in those high-censorship regions.\nIn summary, PrivadoVPN can work in countries with low censorship. However, in countries with strong censorship, it\u2019s better to turn to other services. We recommend reading our list of VPNs that work in China, or our ranking of the best VPNs for Saudi Arabia.\nEase of Use & Compatibility\nPrivadoVPN stands out for its easy-to-use interface and broad device compatibility, making it a great option for both beginners and experienced users. In this section, we\u2019ll provide an in-depth analysis of how well the VPN works across different platforms and how simple it is to navigate.\nPrivadoVPN App Interface (PC and Mobile Platforms)\nThe app interface remains the same on all platforms, it is clean, intuitive, and simple to use. It features a large connect button right on the home screen, allowing you to quickly connect to the nearest or the best server.\nThe settings are easy to navigate, and essential features such as split tunneling, kill switch, and server selection are all accessible from the main dashboard without needing to dive into complicated menus. This makes it convenient even for those who aren\u2019t tech-savvy.\nDevice Compatibility\nPrivadoVPN is compatible with a wide range of devices, ensuring flexibility in usage. It offers native apps for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and even Amazon Fire TV. This multi-platform support makes it convenient for those who want to protect their privacy on various devices.\nIn our test, we found the apps to work seamlessly across all platforms with no significant differences in performance or features. If you\u2019re an advanced user, you can refer to PrivadoVPN\u2019s support manuals on setting up routers and Linux devices, allowing you to use VPN on all devices.\nUp to 10 Simultaneous Connections\nPrivadoVPN allows for up to 10 simultaneous connections, which is generous compared to other VPN services that often limit you to 5 or 6 devices. This is especially beneficial for families or individuals with multiple devices. Whether you\u2019re securing your smartphone, laptop, desktop, or smart TV, PrivadoVPN has you covered.\nSetting Up PrivadoVPN on Routers\nIf you want to secure your entire network, PrivadoVPN can be manually set up on compatible routers. This is a useful feature if you have several devices that aren\u2019t natively supported by the app, such as gaming consoles or smart home devices.\nBy configuring the VPN on your router, every device connected to that router benefits from VPN protection. While the detailed guides are handy, the steps are too straightforward. We felt that adding more steps and images would make it easy for even those who aren\u2019t technically aware.\nCustomer Support\nWhen using a VPN, responsive and knowledgeable customer support can greatly improve the overall user experience. PrivadoVPN offers several options for customer assistance, but does it truly provide the in-depth help that users might need during setup or troubleshooting?\nAvailable Support Channels\nPrivadoVPN\u2019s website provides email support, a knowledge base, and an FAQ section. The knowledge base covers common queries related to installation, account management, and troubleshooting issues.\nHowever, it lacks live chat support, which is a major drawback for those who expect real-time assistance. Email inquiries can take up to 24 hours for a response, so it\u2019s not ideal for urgent matters.\nResponse Quality\nBased on our test of PrivadoVPN\u2019s customer support, we found the email responses to be polite, helpful, and accurate, but not always timely. While the support team is knowledgeable, the lack of instant communication options may leave you frustrated if you encounter an issue that requires immediate attention.\nIf you\u2019re looking for the best support, we have never found any better than NordVPN and ExpressVPN. They are always quick with their 24-x7 live chat support.\nSelf-Help Resources\nPrivadoVPN\u2019s FAQ section and knowledge base are fairly detailed, but they could benefit from more comprehensive troubleshooting guides and tutorials. Compared to other VPN providers that offer extensive video tutorials or step-by-step guides, PrivadoVPN\u2019s self-help resources feel somewhat limited.\nFinal Verdict: Should You Choose PrivadoVPN?\nPrivadoVPN ticks the boxes for privacy and security, offering strong encryption, a no-logs policy, and features like the Control Tower for advanced ad and threat blocking. However, in a competitive VPN market, these offerings aren\u2019t enough to stand out.\nWith a smaller server network spanning 49 countries, you may experience congestion during peak times, especially in high-demand regions. Struggles to unlock regional content, speed drops on long-distance connections, and the lack of dedicated servers for streaming or P2P also limit its appeal for power users.\nCustomer support is another downside. The absence of live chat and slower email response times can be frustrating, especially when compared to providers that offer 24/7 live assistance.\nTo summarize our review of PrivadoVPN, the service works well for casual users needing basic privacy and access to geo-blocked content. However, if you\u2019re looking for a feature-rich, high-performance VPN with a broader server network and better support, services like NordVPN or ExpressVPN offer more value for serious users."

      "text": "NordVPN is a renowned VPN service, known for impenetrable security, worldwide servers, and superb compatibility. If you\u2019re looking to get it, you\u2019ll first be interested in NordVPN pricing. Second, you\u2019ll want to know more about it, and for that, here is our NordVPN review.\nToday\u2019s article is essentially the NordVPN cost analysis. It\u2019s a buyer\u2019s guide that explains how much NordVPN is in 2025 and discusses the features the user gets in each plan. We\u2019ll compare NordVPN Basic vs Plus, as well as examine its high-tier Complete and Ultimate plans.\nLet\u2019s dive right in and determine the cost of NordVPN in 2025 together.\nNordVPN Pricing: How Much is This VPN?\nNordVPN offers various promotions that change periodically. However, its prices never fluctuate that much. To ensure you get the best possible price on it, we suggest using our NordVPN coupon that\u2019ll automatically \u201cconnect\u201d you to the latest and greatest discount.\nWith that in mind, we\u2019ll refer to NordVPN pricing as it is when you buy it using our buttons.\nOkay, so NordVPN has biennial, annual, and monthly plans. Biennial and annual plans yield savings \u2014 monthly plans are pricey.\nNordVPN\u2019s biennial plans sometimes offer 3 extra months, and if you click one of the buttons in this article, you\u2019ll save at least 72% on each.\nThe biennial plans are:\n- Basic \u2014 $3.09/mo or $83.43 upfront\n- Plus \u2014 $3.99/mo or $107.73 upfront\n- Complete \u2014 $4.99/mo or $134.73 upfront\n- Prime \u2014 $6.99/mo or $188.73 upfront\nWe should also analyze the pricing of annual plans:\nThey\u2019re expectedly more expensive but still some of the best VPN deals around. These are their prices:\n- Basic \u2014 $4.99/mo or $59.88 upfront\n- Plus \u2014 $5.99/mo or $71.88 upfront\n- Complete \u2014 $6.99/mo or $83.88 upfront\n- Prime \u2014 $8.99/mo $107.88 upfront\nNordVPN also has monthly plans but their prices aren\u2019t exactly low, plus, there are no savings to be made. They range from a whopping $12.99/mo for Basic to $17.99/mo for Prime, making them a poor choice for the long term.\nNordVPN Basic vs Plus vs Complete vs Prime\nNow that we\u2019ve established NordVPN prices, it\u2019s time to see what these plans are.\nI mean, you\u2019re aware that they differ in length, but Basic, Plus, Complete, and Prime plans build upon each other, expanding the package far beyond the VPN\u2019s capabilities. How so?\nLet us examine their crucial differences in the table below:\n| Basic | Plus | Complete | Prime | |\n| VPN Features | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |\n| Threat Protection Pro | \u274c | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |\n| NordPass | \u274c | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u2705 |\n| NordLocker 1 TB | \u274c | \u274c | \u2705 | \u2705 |\n| NordProtect | \u274c | \u274c | \u274c | \u2705 |\nThe Basic plan\u2019s low price lets you enjoy NordVPN\u2019s \u201cvanilla\u201d form. You\u2019ll still get access to all of the servers, Double VPN, P2P servers for torrenting, and even obfuscation to be able to use it in China. However, the Basic plan lacks malware/tracker protection and ad-blocking.\nThis is where the Plus plan chimes in. It comes with Threat Protection Pro, which is designed to block ads, trackers, malicious downloads, and malware in real time. It transforms the provider into a VPN with an antivirus, which contributes to online security tremendously.\nNot to mention, NordVPN Plus also includes NordPass, a lightweight password manager. It helps you create, manage, and store passwords securely, without anyone\u2019s notice. The Complete plan, as said, builds upon it by introducing 1 TB of NordLocker storage.\nIt\u2019s end-to-end-encrypted cloud storage with ample space to store your precious videos, photos, documents, or anything else. The Prime plan is the only one with NordProtect, which enables ID theft insurance and protects you against cyber extortion and data breaches.\nWhat\u2019s the Best Plan for Me in 2025?\nLength-wise, biennial plans are best for savings if you plan a long haul with this VPN. However, the best plan for you depends on which price is suitable for your budget. While the Basic plan saves you the most, it doesn\u2019t have a whole lot to offer.\nSure, you do get a VPN and it\u2019s a phenomenal one, but there\u2019s no malware protection, which would\u2019ve been handy, as it works on all devices. NordVPN deems its Plus plan the best value. At under $4/mo, it fills in the void with Threat Protection Pro and NordPass. Both are great.\nIf you can afford it, the Complete plan is likely the best option for most users. With added cloud storage, you can secure your privacy AND your files, which is equally important. Obviously, the beefiest Prime plan is best overall, but it\u2019s costly, even with the said discount.\nDoes NordVPN Offer a Free Trial?\nIf you\u2019re not willing to pay associated NordVPN prices, you can begin with a free trial. NordVPN offers two options. One is a 7-day free trial when signing up on Android and another is a 30-day money-back guarantee, which requires a subscription beforehand.\nIn the first case, you\u2019ll simply have to sign up on Android and provide a credit card. Immediately after, you can install the VPN and use it normally on all devices, not just Android phones and tablets. A 30-day money-back guarantee allows you to test the provider longer.\nAlbeit, you must subscribe, as you normally would initially. Despite that, this is still a foolproof solution. NordVPN\u2019s refund policy is non-conditional, and if you\u2019re a first-time user, you\u2019ll be 100% refunded the same day. The conclusion is that there\u2019s no risk in trying it.\nRefer to this NordVPN free trial guide to find out in detail how to test the service without paying.\nTest NordVPN for Free for 30 Days\nFeatures Rundown\nDespite its low-cost plans, NordVPN doesn\u2019t skimp on features, which it uses to provide:\nOnline Security and Privacy\nYou can protect your privacy and security with a simple connection to one of its 7,400 servers in 118 countries. Pick one, connect, and you\u2019ll be encrypted in no time. NordVPN\u2019s kill switch will deter DNS leaks, while its RAM-only servers will prevent your data from being stored for too long.\nNot to mention, NordVPN relies on a certified no-logging policy, so it stores nothing in the first place. RAM-based servers are just a safety measure because they can be restarted in seconds and lose all their data, even though there\u2019s nothing on them.\nNordVPN\u2019s Double VPN servers can encrypt your traffic twice, and Onion over VPN servers protect your dark web adventures. If you get the Plus plan, you\u2019ll even protect your device from malicious entities with Threat Protection Pro. It\u2019s a 360-degree security package.\nEndless Streaming\nConsidering associated NordVPN costs, it\u2019s impressive what this provider can do for streaming lovers. It\u2019ll easily unblock Netflix libraries or any other streaming service you can\u2019t access otherwise. Its servers are optimized for speed, reliability, and streaming on all devices.\nThere\u2019s also Smart DNS called SmartPlay, which allows for streaming on non-VPN-friendly platforms. Pair this with unlimited bandwidth, a revolutionary NordLynx protocol, and market-leading speeds, and you\u2019ll see why it\u2019s so popular among binge-watchers.\nUninterrupted Torrenting\nAll plans are equipped with P2P servers. These are bespoke servers for torrenting whose purpose in \u201clife\u201d is to enable encrypted, safe, and fast torrenting for your convenience. We\u2019ll remember a no-log policy that guarantees that no data lingers on NordVPN\u2019s servers.\nThis means only one. You can connect to any P2P server and download torrents in complete anonymity. If you want, you can even use NordVPN\u2019s SOCKS5 proxy to speed things up or enable NordWhisper to overcome network filtering when using restricted networks.\nSafe Online Gaming\nGamers love VPNs because they protect them against DDoS and doxxing attacks.\nNordVPN does this but amplifies the experience with incredible performance for combating ISP throttling and reducing latency. The result is a perfect blend of gaming enjoyment and privacy.\nNordVPN is also the best Xbox VPN, but rest assured, people use it on all other gaming consoles and gaming computers to make each gaming session a pure joy.\nNordVPN Pricing: The Final Verdict\nSome of you might find NordVPN prices a bit confusing at first. However, we believe all NordVPN pricing plans are listed clearly, and with our guide to explain everything, you shouldn\u2019t have any issues. The point is that NordVPN starts at $3.09/mo for its biennial Basic plan.\nThis a VPN-only plan, with no beefy extras. The biennial Plus and Complete plans are what most users will want, at $3.99/mo and $4.99/mo. They offer malware protection, NordPass, and/or NordLocker, while Prime, the last one, packs NordProtect on top at $6.99/mo.\nNow that you know how much NordVPN is in 2025 and the features you\u2019ll get in each plan, hopefully, you can choose the right one for you. If not, there\u2019s a 30-day money-back guarantee, so it\u2019s not the end of the world if you end up not liking what you got.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nOur NordVPN pricing guide is done, but let\u2019s top it up with answers to your questions.\n\ud83e\udd14 Is NordVPN worth it?\nDrawing from our experience, it\u2019s very well worth the price. This applies to the entire range of plans. However, it\u2019s worth noting that its monthly plans are too pricey, while annual and biennial plans are way cheaper, but they require an upfront payment for the given period.\nDespite being inconvenient at first, the price difference is huge after a year or two. Would you rather pay $12.99 monthly or $3.09/mo upfront for 2 years? You can calculate the difference and see how much you\u2019ll save.\n\ud83c\udd93 Can I use NordVPN for free?\nYes, but only for a limited period, via a 7-day trial on Android or a 30-day money-back guarantee, with a refund at the end. Sadly, NordVPN features don\u2019t come for free, and never will, because it\u2019s a market-leading provider. Check out these free VPNs if you\u2019re okay with their persistent limitations.\n\u267b\ufe0f What are NordVPN\u2019s renewal prices?\nNordVPN prices explained in this article are introductory, which means that once the initial 24-month or 12-month period is over, prices will change. For example, both annual and biennial plans renew as annual plans, and their prices are:\n- Basic \u2014 $139.08 a year\n- Plus \u2014 $179.88 a year\n- Complete \u2014 $219.48 a year\n- Prime \u2014 $371.88 a year"

      "text": "Kodi gives you the freedom to stream just about anything, but that freedom comes with strings. Without a VPN, your internet provider can throttle your speeds, block access to certain add-ons, or log everything you\u2019re watching. And if you\u2019re using third-party streaming sources, you\u2019re exposing your IP address.\nA good VPN keeps your Kodi activity private, helps you access geo-blocked content, and stops buffering caused by network throttling. But not all VPNs play nice with Kodi.\nThat\u2019s why we put the top VPNs for Kodi to the test. We looked at how well they handled popular add-ons like Seren and The Crew, tested them on Raspberry Pi and Fire TV, and checked for leaks, slowdowns, and playback issues. If you want to make Kodi smoother, safer, and more capable, you need a VPN that\u2019s built for it. Let\u2019s look at the best options for 2025 and how to get them running.\nWhy You Should Always Use a VPN With Kodi\nKodi itself is perfectly legal. But once you start using third-party add-ons like Seren, The Crew, or SportsDevil, you\u2019re stepping into legal gray zones. These add-ons often source content from unofficial or unlicensed streams. Even if you\u2019re just browsing, your IP address is exposed\u2014and everything you watch is easy to trace.\nMany internet service providers throttle streaming apps, especially on shared networks like dorms or public Wi\u2011Fi. Kodi users get hit particularly hard since data usage can spike during high-definition playback. A VPN helps you avoid throttling by encrypting your traffic and hiding the fact that you\u2019re using Kodi at all.\nIf you\u2019re trying to access geo-blocked content, a VPN is the only way in. Whether it\u2019s watching out-of-market sports, unlocking international TV channels, or accessing Netflix and Hulu+ libraries that aren\u2019t available in your region, a VPN gives you the control to switch your virtual location and bypass those restrictions.\nAnd then there\u2019s privacy. Without a VPN, your IP address is out in the open. Every Kodi add-on, every scraper, and every hosting source can see exactly who you are and where you\u2019re located. With the right VPN, that exposure disappears.\nBest VPNs for Kodi in 2025: Our Ranking\nWe didn\u2019t just run speed tests and call it a day. These VPNs were tested with real Kodi add-ons, on real Kodi devices, over real-world networks. From streaming through The Crew on a Fire TV Stick to running IPTV on a Raspberry Pi, we pushed each service to see who could handle buffer-free playback, device quirks, and privacy under pressure.\n1. NordVPN \u2014 Best Kodi VPN for Speed and Streaming\nIf your Kodi setup relies on high-quality streams and add-ons that demand speed and stability, NordVPN is the one to beat. It handled everything we threw at it, from fast-switching between servers while streaming live TV to maintaining crisp 1080p and 4K playback without stalling.\nStream-Ready Speeds with NordLynx: NordVPN\u2019s secret weapon is NordLynx, its WireGuard-based protocol. It kept speeds consistently high across our Kodi tests, with minimal impact on bandwidth even during peak hours, and rarely dipped below 85% of our base speed.\nSmartPlay for Geo-Unblocking: Getting around region locks was easy. We connected to UK, US, and Canadian servers, then tested add-ons pulling content from BBC iPlayer, Pluto TV, and USTVnow. NordVPN\u2019s SmartPlay feature handled the switching in the background, letting us focus on watching instead of troubleshooting.\nPrivacy and Leak Protection: Kodi users need solid protection, especially when dealing with P2P-based sources. NordVPN comes with a built-in kill switch, DNS and IPv6 leak protection, and obfuscated servers for bypassing network restrictions.\nDevice Support and Setup: We installed this top VPN on a Fire TV Stick, Android TV box, Raspberry Pi (via router), and Windows laptop. The app setup was straightforward on all supported platforms, and its smart auto-connect feature helped avoid manual setup every time Kodi launched.\nYou can protect up to 10 devices at once, and long-term plans come in at just over $3/month, backed by a 30-day money-back guarantee. For Kodi users who value performance and privacy, it\u2019s a strong investment that pays off every stream.\nPros\n- Excellent speeds with NordLynx\n- Works with all Kodi add-ons\n- Strong privacy for P2P streams\n- Native apps for Fire and Android TV\n- Audited no-logs policy\n- Affordable long-term plans\nCons\n- Price fluctuations\n2. ExpressVPN \u2014 Best VPN for Kodi on Fire Stick and Smart TVs\nIf you want Kodi to run like a polished streaming app with zero fuss, ExpressVPN is the smoothest option around. It worked flawlessly on Fire TV, Android TV, and even Raspberry Pi, keeping things stable while streaming high-bitrate add-ons like The Crew and Tempest.\nLightway Keeps Playback Fast and Consistent: ExpressVPN\u2019s Lightway Turbo protocol is built for devices that struggle with heavy traffic, and it shows. During Kodi tests on both Wi\u2011Fi and mobile hotspots, we were able to stream 1080p with zero buffering on add-ons that usually stall under pressure.\nSeamless Streaming With Minimal Setup: Geo-blocked content didn\u2019t stand a chance. We tested live sports add-ons and free-to-air channels from the US, UK, and Australia, all of them loaded fast, without proxy errors. ExpressVPN\u2019s Smart DNS feature (MediaStreamer) also helped with Kodi installs on smart TVs that don\u2019t support native apps.\nStrong Privacy and Always-On Protection: ExpressVPN uses RAM-only TrustedServer tech, which means no data is ever written to disk. That\u2019s a big plus for privacy-focused Kodi users who want to stay anonymous while streaming from unofficial sources. The Network Lock (kill switch) worked during every drop test, keeping our IP protected even on flaky hotel Wi\u2011Fi.\nDevice Compatibility and Install Ease: We ran ExpressVPN across Fire Stick, Windows, macOS, Android TV, and a router install for Raspberry Pi. App interfaces were intuitive, and the VPN connected automatically when Kodi launched. Plans start at around $5/month, and with a 30-day money-back guarantee, you can test it on every Kodi device you own without risk.\nPros\n- Excellent performance with Lightway\n- Works great on Fire TV and Android TV\n- RAM-only servers with no user logs\n- Smart DNS for Kodi without VPN apps\n- Easy install across platforms\n- Offers free 7-day trial on mobile\nCons\n- No advanced settings for power users\n- More expensive than other options\n3. Private Internet Access \u2014 Best for Power Users\nIf you\u2019re the kind of Kodi user who loves tweaking settings, digging into menus, and optimizing every inch of your setup, Private Internet Access is your go-to VPN. It\u2019s flexible, powerful, and surprisingly smooth with Kodi once configured right.\nAdvanced Customization Without Losing Simplicity: PIA gives you more control than most VPNs. You can switch between WireGuard and OpenVPN, adjust encryption levels, set custom DNS, and even enable port forwarding, all through the app.\nGreat for Kodi Boxes and Router Installs: PIA runs natively on Windows, macOS, Android TV, Fire Stick, and can be configured easily on a router for Raspberry Pi-based Kodi builds. We tested it on a Pi 4 running Kodi via LibreELEC with traffic routed through a PIA-enabled router. Once up, it stayed stable for hours without any IP leaks or playback drops.\nP2P-Friendly and Built for Privacy: All of PIA\u2019s servers support P2P, which is essential for Kodi add-ons that rely on decentralized streaming. You also get MACE, PIA\u2019s built-in blocker that filters ads, trackers, and some malware, which is a nice bonus for anyone using third-party Kodi repositories.\nEasy on the Wallet, Hard to Beat on Value: Despite all the advanced features, pricing is where Private Internet Access really hits the right spot. Long-term plans start at just over $2/month, and you get unlimited device connections, making it ideal for Kodi households with multiple streaming setups.\nTry Private Internet Access Now\nPros\n- Customizable protocol and encryption settings\n- Works on all major Kodi platforms\n- P2P support and strong privacy history\n- MACE helps with shady Kodi sources\nCons\n- Interface can be a bit for newbies\n- Slightly slower than NordVPN servers\n4. Surfshark \u2014 Best Kodi VPN for Multi-Device Kodi Setups\nSurfshark VPN is a favorite for Kodi users who want something fast, simple, and scalable. If your household has multiple Kodi boxes or you bounce between Fire TV, Android TV, and laptops, Surfshark\u2019s unlimited device support makes it a no-brainer.\nClean Interface, Fast Streams: Surfshark\u2019s UI is refreshingly minimal, and its WireGuard protocol delivered steady performance across our test devices. We streamed in 1080p and 4K using add-ons like The Crew and Tempest with zero stutters, even during evening peak hours. Switching servers took seconds, and reconnects on weaker Wi\u2011Fi were handled without a hitch.\nKodi-Friendly Features for the Everyday Streamer: While it doesn\u2019t offer deep customization like PIA, Surfshark still covers the essentials: P2P support on all servers, a kill switch, private DNS, and split tunneling. Add in CleanWeb, which blocks ads and trackers at the DNS level, and you\u2019re getting an extra layer of protection, especially useful with third-party Kodi sources.\nUnlimited Devices, One Plan: The standout feature? Unlimited simultaneous connections. We ran Surfshark on six Kodi devices at once (Fire Stick, two Android TVs, a Raspberry Pi, and two laptops), and performance stayed consistent.\nEasy to Set Up, Easy to Forget: Installation on all Kodi-compatible platforms was quick, and once Surfshark was running, we rarely had to touch it again. It autoconnected on boot, remembered our preferred servers, and quietly did its job in the background.\nSurfshark\u2019s long-term plans start around $2/month, and come with a 30-day money-back guarantee, making it an affordable yet powerful choice for Kodi users who just want things to work.\nPros\n- Unlimited device connections\n- Fast, stable WireGuard performance\n- Native apps for Fire TV and Android TV\n- Affordable pricing with strong features\nCons\n- Fewer advanced settings\n- Multihop doesn\u2019t use WireGuard\n5. Proton VPN \u2014 Best Free VPN for Safe Kodi Browsing\nIf you\u2019re looking for a free VPN that actually respects your privacy, Proton VPN is the standout. It\u2019s not ideal for streaming high-resolution Kodi content or unlocking every geo-block, but it\u2019s a strong pick for users who want basic Kodi protection without paying upfront.\nStrong Security Without the Price Tag: Proton VPN\u2019s free tier includes unlimited data, which is rare. Most free VPNs either cap bandwidth or inject ads. Here, you get clean connections, AES-256 encryption, DNS leak protection, and a strict no-logs policy, all without paying a cent.\nLimited Speed and No Streaming Support: Here\u2019s the tradeoff. The free servers are slower than premium plans, and they don\u2019t work with Netflix, BBC iPlayer, or other major geo-restricted Kodi content. You\u2019ll still be able to stream public domain or unblocked add-ons, but if your setup relies on region-switching or 4K playback, you\u2019ll likely hit buffering walls.\nDevice Support and Setup: Proton VPN works on Windows (it\u2019s arguably the best free VPN for Windows PCs), macOS, Android, Fire OS, and routers, with open-source apps and a simple interface. It lacks some automation features found in the premium players, but setup is easy enough, and once connected, it runs reliably in the background.\nProton VPN\u2019s paid plans unlock access to streaming servers, higher speeds, and more countries. If you like the interface and care about Swiss-based privacy, the upgrade is worth it. But even if you stick with the free plan, it\u2019s one of the safest no-cost ways to protect your Kodi traffic.\nPros\n- Unlimited free data with strong privacy\n- No ads or logging, even on the free plan\n- Easy to install on Kodi-supported devices\n- Paid upgrade unlocks fast streaming servers\nCons\n- Free tier doesn\u2019t support streaming\n- Slower speeds compared to others\n- No native Fire TV app\nWhat Makes a VPN Truly Great for Kodi\nNot all VPNs are built with Kodi in mind. The wrong one can slow your stream, break your add-ons, or fail to run on the devices you actually use. Here\u2019s what separates the great from the forgettable.\n- Fast, Streaming-Ready Protocols: Look for VPNs with speed-first protocols like WireGuard or Lightway. They minimize lag and keep playback smooth, even in 4K. NordVPN\u2019s NordLynx delivered top speeds in our tests with IPTV and high-bitrate add-ons.\n- Full P2P Support and Leak Protection: Many Kodi add-ons rely on peer-to-peer sharing, so your VPN needs to support P2P on all servers, not just a few. Private Internet Access stood out with RAM-only servers, DNS leak protection, and a kill switch that worked every time.\n- Kodi Device Compatibility: A great VPN should work across Fire Stick, Android TV, Raspberry Pi, Windows, and macOS. ExpressVPN nailed this with reliable apps that ran smoothly on all platforms we tested.\n- Simple Setup and Device Flexibility: Whether you\u2019re installing on a Kodi box or routing traffic through your network, setup should be quick and hassle-free. Surfshark makes it easy with helpful guides, unlimited device support, and an interface that just works.\n- Proven Privacy and No-Logs Policy: If privacy matters, look for VPNs with independent audits and real-world transparency. Proton VPN earned points for its open-source apps and strong privacy documentation, even on the free plan.\nHow to Install a VPN on Kodi (Quick Steps for All Devices)\nYou don\u2019t install a VPN inside Kodi; you install it alongside. Once it\u2019s running in the background, Kodi routes its traffic through the VPN just like any other app. Based on your device setup, here\u2019s how to get started.\nAndroid TV & Kodi Boxes\nMost Android TV boxes that run Kodi can install a VPN app directly.\n- Open the Google Play Store.\n- Search for your Android TV VPN app (NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Surfshark, or PIA).\n- Install, log in, and connect to a server.\n- Launch Kodi \u2014 all traffic is now routed through the VPN.\nIf your box doesn\u2019t have Play Store access, you\u2019ll need to sideload the APK from the VPN\u2019s website using a file manager.\nFire Stick or Fire TV\nThis is one of the easiest setups thanks to native apps.\n- Go to Fire TV home screen > Find > Search.\n- Type in your VPN (e.g. ExpressVPN).\n- Download, open the app, and sign in.\n- Tap \u201cConnect\u201d to activate the VPN.\n- Open Kodi and stream safely.\nIf the app isn\u2019t available in your region, sideload the APK using Downloader.\nWindows or macOS\nPerfect for users running Kodi on a laptop or media PC.\n- Download your VPN from the official site.\n- Install the app, log in, and connect.\n- Keep it running in the background.\n- Open Kodi \u2014 traffic is now encrypted and masked.\nFor extra privacy, set the VPN to auto-launch on boot and enable the kill switch.\nRouter Setup (For Kodi on Raspberry Pi or Other No-GUI Devices)\nIf your Kodi device can\u2019t run a VPN app, use a VPN-enabled router.\n- Log in to your router\u2019s admin panel (192.168.x.x).\n- Flash with custom firmware like DD-WRT or AsusWRT-Merlin if needed.\n- Add your VPN\u2019s OpenVPN config or use their router app (NordVPN and ExpressVPN support this).\n- Once connected, all devices on the network \u2014 including Kodi boxes \u2014 are covered.\nFor preconfigured plug-and-play options, some VPNs also sell ready-to-use routers.\nFinal Tips: Test Before You Stream\n- Use dnsleaktest.com or ipleak.net on Kodi\u2019s browser (if available) or a paired device to verify the VPN is active.\n- Check your Kodi add-ons. If region-locked content is now accessible, you\u2019re good to go.\n- Still seeing blocks? You might want to try switching protocols (WireGuard or Lightway) or changing servers.\nFinal Thoughts\nKodi\u2019s power lies in freedom, but that freedom comes with risks. Whether you\u2019re unlocking global content, relying on third-party add-ons, or just trying to avoid buffering, a good VPN makes the experience smoother, safer, and far more reliable.\nAll the VPNs we tested worked well, but NordVPN stood out as the most consistent across speed, privacy, and device support. It handled high-bitrate add-ons, bypassed region locks without fail, and stayed rock-solid on everything from Fire TV Stick to Raspberry Pi."

      "text": "You\u2019re not selfish if you\u2019re not fond of sharing. Some people prefer using a VPN that offers dedicated IP addresses for many reasons. For one, you\u2019re the only person using the IP address, which helps prevent IP blacklisting and allows you to use online banking without suspicion.\nShared IPs can be detected as spam by some platforms, which prevents access to them. Another reason to use a VPN with dedicated or static IP addresses is bypassing CAPTCHA. On top of that, dedicated IP VPN providers offer the same benefits as \u201cnormal\u201d ones.\nThis means you still get bank-grade encryption and features like IP leak protection, a kill switch, and modern security protocols. Sadly, very few providers offer dedicated or static IP addresses. We\u2019ll explore those that do and talk about the very best options in 2025.\nBest VPNs With Dedicated and Static IP Addresses in 2025\nLet\u2019s immediately cut to the chase. Our team has prepared 3 excellent dedicated IP VPNs, some of which even offer static IP addresses. The best picks in 2025 include:\n- NordVPN\n- Private Internet Access\n- Surfshark (includes static IPs as well)\nLet\u2019s discuss their dedicated IP offerings and see what they have in store.\n1. NordVPN\nNordVPN is our top choice for a VPN with dedicated IP addresses overall. It sports an array of security features, uncapped bandwidth, and over 6,400 servers globally. It also works for streaming and torrenting, all while not keeping any logs. You can say it\u2019s the #1-rated VPN for privacy and security.\nDedicated IP Offer\nWhat does this dedicated IP VPN offer if you don\u2019t want to use a shared IP address? For the start, you get 24 countries, such as the UK, the USA, Hong Kong, Poland, Singapore, Australia, Canada, Denmark, and many more. The US, for example, has 7 cities, which is great.\nIn terms of price, NordVPN won\u2019t be the cheapest VPN with dedicated IP addresses. It depends on the subscription length. For example, if you pick the 2-year option, you\u2019ll pay $4.19 a month, which is around $100 for the first 2 years. You also have the annual plan.\nThis one bumps the price to $5.89 a month or $70 for the first year. The least cost-effective option is the monthly plan at $8.99. Bear in mind you\u2019ll need an active NordVPN subscription to get these IP addresses. Also, the price is per IP address \u2013 if you need two, you\u2019ll pay double.\nGet NordVPN\u2019s Dedicated IP Address\nOther Features\nAs said, NordVPN is an all-around pick with no specific shortcomings. Its base subscription is pretty cheap as well in 2025, costing as low as $3.1 a month. NordVPN comes with AES-256 encryption to fully secure your traffic. It also uses DNS leak protection for added safety.\nWe appreciate NordVPN\u2019s versatility thanks to dedicated servers. Double VPN servers can encrypt your connection twice and ensure stronger encryption. Users also enjoy Obfuscated servers that can be used in China. Another benefit is P2P optimization for torrenting.\nThis is handy when you want to hide your IP address on torrent sites and download stuff without anyone\u2019s notice. NordVPN has apps for all devices, so you can use this VPN with a dedicated IP on your phone, tablet, laptop, computer, or even a Smart TV.\nWith 10 simultaneous connections, you should be more than satisfied with the 360-degree protection you\u2019ll get. NordVPN has ample other features like malware protection, a dark web monitor, NordLynx, Meshnet, and dozens more. It\u2019s really a state-of-the-art VPN.\nYou can test it risk-free with a 7-day trial. Alternatively, there\u2019s a 30-day money-back guarantee to get a refund if you\u2019re not impressed.\n2. Private Internet Access\nIf you want a cheaper dedicated IP VPN, consider Private Internet Access. It\u2019s a great option for overall privacy, unlimited simultaneous connections, and advanced security features. The VPN is also P2P and streaming-friendly, so it ticks pretty much all the boxes.\nDedicated IP Offer\nSpeaking of ticking the boxes, we\u2019re confident you\u2019ll like its pool of IP addresses. PIA offers 26 locations in total, in countries like the USA, Sweden, Canada, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Singapore, the UK, Belgium, and Australia. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s plenty in the USA.\nUnlike NordVPN with 7 locations in America, PIA opts for 12 locations. This is why PIA is generally considered the best US VPN if you need an IP from this country. Price-wise, it\u2019s also far more affordable. Instead of $4.19, you\u2019ll be charged just $2.50 a month for the 2-year plan.\nThis is exactly $60 for 2 years. PIA lets you get its 6-month dedicated IP VPN plan, which is $4.25 a month or $25.50 every 6 months. The monthly plan is again the black sheep with the price of $5, which, again, isn\u2019t too high compared to NordVPN.\nBear in mind that PIA also requires an active subscription to use its dedicated IPs. However, this shouldn\u2019t be an issue considering the base price of ~$57 for 8 months.\nGet PIA\u2019s Dedicated IP Address\nOther Features\nDon\u2019t be fooled by this provider\u2019s affordability. PIA has everything you need and offers cutting-edge features like Multi-hop, obfuscation with Shadowsocks, and MACE for blocking ads. We love this VPN\u2019s customization, which is reflected in its modern VPN protocols.\nFor example, you can select the transfer method from UDP or TCP. You can also use WireGuard to speed up your connection and get stable performance. Private Internet Access is an expert in security thanks to an automatic kill switch amplified by IPv6 leak prevention.\nAnother option you\u2019ll like is split tunneling which tunnels specific apps through the VPN. On top of everything, PIA has a certified no-logging policy and uses RAM-only servers. This is paramount for not storing any logs and preventing privacy-infringing data leaks.\nAs explained, Private Internet Access capitalizes on affordability and value for the money. Like NordVPN, it packs a 30-day money-back guarantee plus a 7-day free trial if you don\u2019t want to pay upfront. Read our PIA VPN free trial tutorial to test it for free.\n3. Surfshark\nFinally, there\u2019s Surfshark. This is another banger for the money, costing just over $2 a month and packing unlimited simultaneous connections. This is a great VPN for dedicated IP because it also offers static IPs included in every plan. We\u2019ll explain those later.\nDedicated IP Offer\nFor now, let\u2019s focus on the thing you want the most. Getting your dedicated IP address with this VPN will cost $3.75 a month, so it\u2019s a sweet spot between NordVPN and Private Internet Access. Arguably, it\u2019s not very affordable considering it also offers the least locations.\nSurfshark has 11 locations at the time of writing, including the UK, the USA, Australia, Hong Kong, Canada, Germany, France, Holland, Japan, South Africa, and Singapore. Each location has one city, except for the US, with servers in Los Angeles, San Jose, and Dallas.\nThe great thing about these dedicated IPs is their fixed price. It\u2019s $3.75 a month no matter the plan you choose. It\u2019s easy to add them to your existing plan too, pay upfront for the remaining plan\u2019s duration, and enjoy. What about its static IPs?\nWe said they\u2019re included out of the box. You can connect to any static IP and have a fixed address. Bear in mind static IP addresses are also shared, so expect traffic from other users.\nGet Surfshark\u2019s Dedicated IP Address\nOther Features\nSurfshark works closely with NordVPN, offering similar features at a slightly lower price. You still get Multi-hop that you can customize by choosing entry and exit VPN locations. Surfshark also has CleanWeb to block ads and uses WireGuard for the majority of the time.\nWe love Surfshark\u2019s modern-looking apps on all devices. If you buy its One or One+ plan, you can get more amazing features, such as antivirus, which works even on your phone. There\u2019s also the Search browser, which makes you \u201cincognito\u201d and doesn\u2019t track anything.\nSurfshark offers exceptional streaming prowess, working with over thirty Netflix libraries. Like the rest, it\u2019s torrent-optimized and supports Onion Over VPN connections. As the third-best VPN with dedicated and static IP addresses, Surfshark is pretty fast for a cheap provider.\nThis is great for gaming or other bandwidth-hungry activities. With over 3,200 servers in 100 countries, it\u2019s easy to find a fast one too. You can find out more about it in our Surfshark review. Don\u2019t be afraid to test it because it\u2019s cheap and can be free for 30 days.\nDedicated vs Static IP Address: What Are the Differences?\nBy default, every VPN uses shared IP addresses. Let\u2019s say you connect to a server with one IP address. You\u2019re not the only one because other users can connect and use the SAME address to go online. In the case of a dedicated IP address, you almost have the server for yourself.\nOnce you purchase one, the IP address is assigned to you and only YOU can connect to it. We said you \u201calmost\u201d have the server for yourself but that\u2019s partially true. VPNs have servers that house hundreds, sometimes thousands of shared IP addresses.\nThe difference is that you \u201creserve\u201d one of these addresses for yourself and only you can use it. However, the server is still shared by a myriad of users, so don\u2019t be confused if your VPN with a dedicated IP address doesn\u2019t speed up your connection compared to a shared one.\nNow, we have this static IP address. As explained, a static IP stays the same. It\u2019s one address used by many people. In essence, a dedicated IP is also static but can be used by one person. A static IP allows multiple people to use it, making it a so-called shared address.\nThe thing with shared addresses is that they can sometimes be dynamic. This means each time you connect, you can get a new IP. On the contrary, your dedicated IP address remains the same.\nDedicated IP Address Benefits Explained\nDedicated IP VPNs offer numerous benefits but getting this type of address isn\u2019t mandatory. In fact, you\u2019ll do just fine with the typical shared addresses, as long as you don\u2019t have special demands. Speaking of them, here\u2019s why a dedicated IP address is beneficial:\n- Avoiding CAPTCHA puzzles. These often appear when the website thinks you\u2019re a robot \u2013 you\u2019ve seen this. It happens on shared addresses because multiple requests are sent from the same IP. With a dedicated IP, you\u2019re the only person using it, which minimizes CAPTCHA prompts and allows for a better experience.\n- Bypassing blacklisting and bans. VPN-related IPs can be blocked by some sites and platforms, or even game servers. Thankfully, getting your own address can remedy the issue and allow for swift access to any site, game server, or app.\n- Using online banking. Banks will likely prevent access to your account if they detect that the request comes from a different address. Using a single, fixed IP will prevent this and let you pay for stuff or withdraw money promptly.\n- Website hosting. It\u2019s great to have a reliable web hosting provider. However, it\u2019s also handy to have a dedicated IP VPN to host your website more safely, as these IPs are less likely to be targeted by cyber attackers (hackers).\n- Transferring files privately. Some people use this type of address to transfer files with increased privacy. Since you\u2019re the only person using it, file sharing will be uninterrupted, faster, and safer.\nHow to Purchase a Dedicated IP Address: Tutorial\nIn this part, we\u2019ll explain how to subscribe to a VPN with a dedicated IP and select the address you need. Here\u2019s our step-by-step guide:\n1. Subscribing to a VPN\nWe explained that you\u2019ll need a basic VPN subscription beforehand. If you don\u2019t have one, let us recommend NordVPN as the best overall option. Don\u2019t like it? No problem, Private Internet Access and Surfshark are great too and offer slightly cheaper prices.\nYou can use the buttons on this page to snag their cheapest deals and pay merely a few monthly dollars. Simply go to the VPN\u2019s website, subscribe to it, and if needed, verify your account through email. You can now install the provider on your device.\nFrom here, you can connect to any server to encrypt your connection and enjoy all the other benefits. However, if you want to specifically use a dedicated IP, you\u2019ll need to buy it first.\n2. Getting a Dedicated IP Address\nRegardless of the VPN you choose, this is an optional add-on that you\u2019ll pay for on top of your subscription. To get it:\n- Go to your provider\u2019s website and sign in to your account. We\u2019ll use NordVPN as an example.\n- Once your dashboard opens, click \u201cGet Dedicated IP\u201c, as displayed in the image below.\n- You\u2019ll now see the three plans from above. Select the plan you want and click on it.\n- Pay for the subscription using the preferred payment method.\n- Once you subscribe, you\u2019ll be able to select the location you want.\n3. Connecting to a Dedicated IP VPN Server\nWith everything done, you\u2019ll need to find your address. To do so:\n- Open the VPN app \u2013 again, we\u2019re using NordVPN.\n- Select \u201cMore Connection Options\u201d to unwrap the server list.\n- Press the \u201cSpecialty Servers\u201d option.\n- You\u2019ll see a \u201cDedicated IP\u201d choice there. Click on it to connect. You\u2019ll see a green \u201cConnected\u201d message that tells you the connection is in place.\nCan I Get a Free VPN With a Dedicated or Static IP Address?\nNo. We said that this is a premium feature and you won\u2019t find any free provider that offers it. In the same fashion, you won\u2019t find the feature free in premium VPNs. Free providers cut corners by offering not-so-great security and privacy. They also use typical shared IPs.\nThese IPs are also dynamic, so each time you connect, you\u2019re assigned a different IP address. This is in line with most premium providers, which isn\u2019t bad but likely not what you want. It\u2019s good to know that some free choices have static IPs but they\u2019re shared as well.\nWe\u2019re also not fond of free VPN logging practices. Some of them rely too much on logging and storing data to earn revenue. In addition, they lack certain security features, such as Multi-hop, ad-blocking, and RAM-only servers, making them severely inferior.\nOur team has tested many free VPNs but very few were remotely good. We can think of Proton VPN and Hide.me. However, none of them offer these IP addresses. They\u2019re, however, safe and secure and have unlimited bandwidth but without P2P/streaming abilities.\nThe Bottom Line\nAre you struggling with blacklisting, website restrictions, CAPTCHAs, and other annoyances? Perhaps you can resolve them with the best VPNs with dedicated IP addresses. It\u2019s easy to get NordVPN, Private Internet Access, or Surfshark, and purchase a cheap dedicated IP.\nA simple connection to your own address will make things far better. Apart from addressing the aforementioned issues, you\u2019ll revel in unbreakable security, ironclad privacy, fast speed, streaming, torrenting, and much more while not breaking the bank.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHere are a few more bits of information to top up this comprehensive guide.\nAre dedicated IP addresses faster?\nThey could be in theory but not in practice. When you get this address, you\u2019re not renting the entire server. The servers used to store these addresses are still utilized by multiple people who \u201cdrain\u201d their resources. Will you get slower speeds in that case?\nNo. VPN servers are designed for multiple concurrent users. That said, the speed will be the same as with the shared address but with the benefit of you being the only person who can use the address you bought.\nWhat are the downsides of dedicated IPs?\nThere aren\u2019t many. Some experts agree on the lack of anonymity while using them but that\u2019s negligible in our book. For example, it\u2019s simpler for websites and data brokers to associate your online activities with the IP address and thus, track you more easily.\nHowever, bear in mind that these addresses still offer encryption and all other privacy/security features, including a no-log policy. We all know how valuable a no-log policy in a VPN is.\nWhere can I get the cheapest dedicated IP address?\nAccording to our analysis, you\u2019ll get the cheapest one in Private Internet Access. At just $2.5 a month, you\u2019ll pay exactly $60 every 2 years. Best of all, this applies to any location you choose. Whether it\u2019s the USA, Switzerland, or Canada, the price stays the same.\nCombined with its 2-year plan with 4 free months at $57, you can enjoy the provider AND its dedicated IP address for a little over $110 for the first 28 months based on the actual deal. We haven\u2019t mentioned CyberGhost with the same offer, which might be worth checking out."

      "text": "Want to watch US TV live while you\u2019re outside the United States? Go to a television channel\u2019s website, head to the \u201cLive\u201d page, click \u201cPlay,\u201d and \u2014 oh wait. You\u2019re probably reading this because you tried that already, but geo-restrictions threw a wrench in your plans.\nA host of television channels and networks in the United States geo-block their content. The country may be producing some of the world\u2019s finest TV shows, movies, and programs, but licensing agreements restrict some of that content to within America\u2019s borders.\nIf you\u2019re feeling left out, don\u2019t worry; there are a few workarounds. The most convenient and reliable option is to use a virtual private network (VPN). In this article, we\u2019ll focus on that option and show you how to access American TV channels from abroad.\nWhy Are US TV Channels Blocked Abroad?\nWonder why you can\u2019t just fire up your favorite American TV channel\u2019s website and stream live content while abroad? Even if you\u2019re American and have an active TV subscription. Well, the answer lies in a complex web of licensing agreements and content distribution rights.\nBasically, broadcast networks and content creators often sign licensing deals with distributors that limit where their content can be shown. Or the times they can be shown elsewhere. It\u2019s not just an American thing. For instance, you can\u2019t hop on BBC iPlayer to watch UK TV abroad for the same reason.\nTelevision networks and channels use geo-blocking technology to enforce these agreements.\nWhen you visit the NBC News website, for instance, it uses your IP address to determine your approximate location and then blocks you from watching live programs if you\u2019re outside the United States.\nWatch American TV Live Outside the US With a VPN in 5 Steps\nRemember when we mentioned that a VPN is the most convenient way to stream live broadcasts and catch-up content on American TV channels from anywhere in the world? Here\u2019s a guide with simple step-by-step instructions:\n- Choose a Reliable VPN Service: Your preferred provider must have American servers to give you a US IP address. In addition, it must be excellent at bypassing geo-restrictions and has to deliver fast connection speeds. We recommend NordVPN.\n- Subscribe: Visit the VPN\u2019s website to create an account. Select one of the subscription plans on offer and provide the required information to complete the payment.\n- Download the VPN App: Your provider likely has applications (and manual setups) for various operating systems. Download the app for your device from its website or an official mobile app store.\n- Connect to a US Server: Open the VPN and sign into your newly created account. Navigate to the server menu and connect to a server located in the United States. The VPN may take a few moments to change your IP address and encrypt your traffic.\n- Watch American TV live or on-demand: You may need to clear the cache and cookies on your browser. Afterward, you can enjoy live programs as you\u2019re now virtually in the United States, regardless of your actual location.\nThe 5 Best VPNs for Watching US TV Outside the US\nYou\u2019d think any VPN service with American servers is enough to unlock the world of live US television, right? Not quite.\nSure, having US servers is a crucial factor. However, several other features differentiate a great VPN from a good one \u2014 or a dud, for that matter. We know because we\u2019ve tested 40+ providers to draw up this list.\nHere are the five premium services that stood out.\n7492 servers\n118 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n10 simultaneous connections\n9.4 /10\n3000 servers\n105 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n8 simultaneous connections\n9.1 /10\n27000 servers\n91 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n9 /10\n6500 servers\n112 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n10 simultaneous connections\n8.8 /10\n3000 servers\n100 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n8.7 /10\n1. NordVPN\nPros\n- Thousands of US servers\n- Smart DNS for streaming\n- Works with Netflix USA\n- In-house NordLynx protocol\n- Modern-looking apps for all devices\n- The fastest VPN on the list\nCon\n- Seldom connection issues on Windows\nUnsurprisingly, the best VPN on the market is our top choice for watching US TV channels live outside the US. NordVPN effortlessly unblocks anything, from websites to streaming services and TV channels.\nWe checked that out during our NordVPN tests. Connecting to NordVPN\u2019s US servers allowed us to seamlessly access popular streaming services like Netflix US and major networks like ABC and NBC. No matter which platform we attempted, the provider consistently delivered, and we had uninterrupted access to live US television.\nSpeedy access, too. NordVPN is consistently the fastest VPN service, thanks to its well-managed 10 Gbps network. It has over 7,400 servers in 117 countries, with almost 2,000 spread across the United States. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the provider\u2019s proprietary protocol, set by default, is built around the performance-friendly WireGuard.\nStream all you want on any platform, as NordVPN is widely compatible. You can even watch US TV live on devices without native VPN support, thanks to its SmartPlay, which combines the VPN\u2019s security features with Smart DNS.\nNordVPN allows you to connect to a server on up to 10 devices simultaneously, not counting the devices covered by your router.\nInterested in giving NordVPN a go? You\u2019d be doing so risk-free, thanks to a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n2. ExpressVPN\nPros\n- Unblocks all US TV channels abroad\n- MediaStreamer (Smart DNS)\n- Beginner-friendly apps\n- Servers in 20+ locations in the USA\n- Unlimited VPN bandwidth\nCon\n- Not the most affordable pick\nExpressVPN is another quality option for streaming American TV channels while you\u2019re on that trip or vacation abroad. We like how lightweight its apps are, considering how they\u2019re stacked with features. Even complete beginners should have no issues navigating and using them.\nThe provider\u2019s unblocking capabilities are even more impressive. We\u2019ve assessed ExpressVPN extensively in our last round of testing, and it managed to come through each time without hassles. You should have no problems enjoying TV channels and streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video alike.\nAs its name suggests, ExpressVPN takes performance seriously. For example, its proprietary protocol, Lightway, delivers a faster experience than OpenVPN without compromising your online security.\nThe provider has over 3,000 servers across 105 countries, all equipped with 10 Gbps ports to minimize congestion. With a significant chunk of them in the United States, you can easily acquire a US IP address and enjoy reliable connections on your favorite American TV channels.\nExpressVPN offers a wide range of native apps, including for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. But that\u2019s not all \u2014 its MediaStreamer feature can spoof your location on non-compatible devices. That way, you can watch American TV channels directly on your smart TV or streaming device. It has an eight-device simultaneous connection limit.\nSubscription plans may be on the higher end, but a 30-day money-back guarantee allows you to test the waters before committing.\n3. Private Internet Access\nPros\n- Servers in all states\n- Incredible security\n- Unlimited simultaneous connections\n- Affordable biennial plan\n- VPN obfuscation\nCons\n- Not the best pick for Netflix\n- It lacks a Firestick app\nGranted, you may experience mixed success while trying to beat tough geo-blocks on major streaming services with PIA. So, why is it on this list? Because it doesn\u2019t have that issue with American TV channels.\nWe confirmed this during our tests. PIA unblocked access to every channel we threw at it, and we could conveniently watch US TV live outside the USA. That includes the major networks, as well as regional sports networks like Fox Sports and ESPN. We found that streaming-optimized servers located in the East and West of the country produced the best results.\nSpeaking of servers, here\u2019s another reason we consider it a great choice: PIA has VPN servers in every American state. That\u2019s more than any other provider can boast of \u2014 but it\u2019s no big surprise, considering it has more than 30,000 servers in total.\nA vast network doesn\u2019t always mean fast speeds. However, PIA delivers in this area, thanks to 10 Gbps servers across its entire collection and modern speedy protocols like WireGuard.\nPrivate Internet Access has native apps for computers, phones, and compatible smart TVs. Plus, its built-in Smart DNS works on other devices, like gaming consoles and set-up boxes. Most VPNs limit the number of devices you can connect simultaneously. Not PIA \u2014 a single subscription covers all your devices at once.\nIf unsatisfied, you can always cancel your subscription in 30 days and claim a full refund, no questions asked.\n4. Proton VPN\nPros\n- 3,000+ streaming-ready US servers\n- Secure Core for added privacy\n- Fast WireGuard protocol\n- It includes a free plan\nCons\n- Subpar customer support\n- No P2P in the free plan\nProton VPN has the best free VPN app, but we\u2019re focusing on its more robust Plus plan (which is paid). It\u2019s been creeping up in our estimations lately and has blossomed into an excellent VPN for streaming live and catch-up content.\nPaid users can catch the news and episodes of their favorite shows on ABC, NBC, Fox, the CW, and several other US broadcast channels. The VPN worked reliably during our tests, and we never had to switch between servers to find one that worked. The free plan, on the other hand, managed to provide access to a few channels but hit a roadblock on several others.\nYou can watch US TV live smoothly without buffering and slowdowns, just like Proton VPN promises. Its network delivers high-speed connections of up to 10 Gbps on 11,700+ servers globally.\n3,100+ of those servers are in the United States. That means plenty of connection options, and you can easily side-step congested servers. On top of that, it doesn\u2019t impose any data restrictions or bandwidth throttling, which is important for streaming.\nProton VPN has apps for all the major platforms and devices. Like our top choice, NordVPN, you\u2019re restricted to connecting ten devices at once on one account.\nEvery Proton VPN plan comes with a 30-day refund window. If you\u2019re not impressed by its quality, you can cancel within that period and ask for your money back.\n5. Surfshark\nPros\n- Impressive streaming performance\n- No limits on simultaneous connections\n- NoBorders for bypassing censorship\nCons\n- Pricey monthly plan\n- Occasionally slow speeds\nSurfshark is an excellent choice for the budget-conscious \u2014 as long as they skip the rather pricey monthly plan.\nBut that\u2019s not its only strong forte. Surfshark became a serious contender in our roundup when it unblocked the American TV channels we tested during a trip to Europe. Whether you\u2019re interested in streaming sports, news, or TV shows, it circumvents geo-restrictions hassle-free to deliver the content.\nThe provider mirrored that strong showing when we checked to see if it would provide access to American libraries on platforms like NordVPN, Amazon Prime Video, Max, and Hulu.\nAlso, Surfshark won\u2019t let you down in terms of performance. While its network of 3,200+ servers in 100 countries isn\u2019t the most extensive we\u2019ve come across, a whopping 600 of those are distributed across 25 American cities. Since upgrading its collection to deliver 10 Gbps connections, Surfshark\u2019s speeds have translated into buffer-less streaming, especially on WireGuard.\nYou can install or manually set up Surfshark on several devices. Its Smart DNS is a practical tool for devices without native support. Like PIA, the provider allows unlimited simultaneous device connections, so all your household devices are covered.\nIf you find you don\u2019t like the service within 30 days of buying a plan, you can request a refund. The VPN will reimburse you, no questions asked.\nHow a VPN Unlocks Access to American TV Channels Abroad\nEarlier, we mentioned that TV websites (any website, really) detect your location using your IP address. You can think of it as your digital address because it identifies your device and reveals your general location. Every internet-enabled device has an IP address.\nSo, you visit a US TV channel\u2019s website. It finds that you\u2019re outside the United States (thanks to your IP address) and prevents you from viewing the programs you\u2019re interested in.\nWhere does a VPN come in? It\u2019s pretty simple. When you connect to a VPN server located in the US, the technology creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and that server.\nWhat\u2019s more, it assigns you a temporary new IP address from the server location.\nThat new IP address becomes your disguise because it tricks the website into \u201cthinking\u201d that you\u2019re in the US. As long as you use a quality streaming VPN like those discussed above, you should be able to enjoy your favorite live content as long as you\u2019re connected.\nHow We Picked the Best VPNs to Watch American TV Outside the US\nHere\u2019s what to look for in a top-tier VPN for watching US TV live abroad:\n- Unblocking Ability: Can it bypass geo-restrictions and unblock your favorite US channels and streaming services? A top choice should consistently grant access to a wide range of US-locked content.\n- Strong US Server Presence: An extensive global network is great, but it\u2019s all the better if a VPN has a deep pool of servers in the United States. We prioritized VPNs with plenty of US servers for optimal connection speeds and reliability.\n- Speed and Performance: Laggy streams are a nightmare. Speed tests helped us identify VPNs that deliver fast connections for smooth, uninterrupted streaming on live US TV channels. The providers on our list are among the fastest on the market.\n- Privacy and Security: These aspects don\u2019t take a back seat just because you\u2019re interested in streaming. We only considered VPNs with robust arsenals that include the highest encryption standards and industry-standard features.\n- Device Compatibility: So that you can watch US TV on the go (or on your smart TV), we took into account the availability of apps for various platforms, like Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, etc. Plus, every VPN on our list allows more simultaneous connections than the industry average.\n- Money-Back Guarantee: VPNs don\u2019t always deliver what they promise. Thankfully, with a money-back guarantee, you can confirm that it meets your needs before committing.\nCan You Watch US TV Channels Abroad With a Free VPN?\nThey may seem tempting for the obvious reason, but free VPNs tend to under-deliver. Even worse, they may come with privacy and security risks.\nTake their limited networks, for instance. That typically means overcrowded servers during peak periods, resulting in crawling connection speeds. Throw in the fact that most free providers cap data and throttle bandwidth, and you can see how they\u2019re recipes for frustrating streaming experiences.\nThat is if the VPN even manages to unblock the TV channel you\u2019re interested in \u2014 and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d.\nOn top of that, many free VPNs collect information liberally to sell for profit. They may also have subpar (and missing) security features. We listed some good free VPNs you can use in the USA but be mindful of their flaws \u2014 again, paid VPNs will be infinitely more reliable!\nFinal Thoughts\nA VPN is the tool you need if you\u2019re a fan or an American abroad interested in watching US TV live outside the country. The right provider unblocks channels easily and guarantees fast connection speeds for stable streaming.\nThis article explored the steps to take, as well as the VPNs you should consider. Top on our list is NordVPN. A heavy US presence (nearly 2,000 servers), blazing-fast speeds, and exceptional unblocking mean you can enjoy streaming like you\u2019re in the US.\nWatch US TV abroad with NordVPN\nFAQ\nDo you still feel like you need more information? Let us then answer all your questions.\n\u2696\ufe0f Is watching US TV abroad legal?\nIt\u2019s completely legal but it goes against the terms and conditions of the channels you\u2019re trying to watch. Now, are you going to get sued? No. Will your account on the channel be banned? Likely not \u2014 we can\u2019t say. One thing is certain \u2014 no one will bat an eye!\nThousands of Americans overseas use NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and other VPNs for this and many other purposes. Guess what? We haven\u2019t heard of anyone rotting in a prison cell!\n\ud83e\udd14 Can I unblock Netflix US with a VPN?\nOf course. It\u2019s the same as accessing your favorite US TV channels. Connect to an American server, go to Netflix, and voila! You should now be able to find all the shows and movies you want as if you were on American soil. See this list of the best Netflix VPNs for more info.\n\u274c Can I watch American TV abroad without a VPN?\nNo. You can use a proxy or a free VPN but either expect poor results or no results at all. The only way to access them is to either really be in the USA or have an IP address from any of the states."

      "text": "VPNs come with a wealth of benefits to improve your internet experience. Before getting one, people often wonder how much is a VPN and the price of the subscription. In short, we can say that the typical VPN price is roughly $2 to $7 a month, depending on the provider.\nThat\u2019s a few quids a month, which isn\u2019t too high. However, the VPN pricing is dictated by many things, among which are the quality and subscription length. In today\u2019s article, we\u2019ll analyze the VPN cost of some of the most popular providers to see how much you\u2019ll pay.\nAlso, we\u2019ll discuss other price-influencing factors and give you some money-saving tips. Since we mentioned them, you might want to check out this guide on the cheapest VPNs. If not, let\u2019s begin our analysis and determine your subscription cost.\nVPN Price Variables: What Influences the Cost?\nAt the start, we explained that the price of these services is approximately a few dollars a month. Some exceptions to the rule exist, especially if you opt for an outrageously-priced Astrill VPN or a business-grade VPN. These services operate in a different realm.\nIf you need a commercial VPN, chances are you\u2019ll land in the few-dollar-per-month area. Before we go over the VPN pricing of popular providers in 2025, we\u2019ll quickly examine the factors that can influence their price.\nSubscription Duration\nHow much is a VPN directly depends on the subscription length. These services operate by charging you less for longer plans and vice versa. Let\u2019s say you want a monthly plan. You can, for example, pick NordVPN because it\u2019s the best option overall, and pay $12.99/mo.\nIn 2 years, you\u2019ll pay 24 times $12.99 a month and spend over $310 for 2 years.\nHowever, if you immediately opt for its 2-year plan, you can pay as low as $3 or so a month, in which case, the price is roughly $80 for 2 years. That\u2019s a substantial difference.\nThe cherry on top? You don\u2019t even need a NordVPN coupon to enjoy such a discount. Just click the button below.\nThis doesn\u2019t apply only to NordVPN. As you\u2019ll see in our VPN cost analysis, all providers do this.\nIt\u2019s a great way to keep their subscribers but also offer incentives for people willing to invest in their online privacy in the long run.\nOptional Features\nOptional features can quickly skyrocket the VPN cost. Surfshark and NordVPN offer plenty of them. They\u2019re very useful if you\u2019re willing to pay a few more dollars each month. For instance, NordVPN\u2019s Basic plan offers just the VPN and related features.\nPaying for the Plus plan already gives you anti-malware, web protection, tracker blocker, password manager, and so on. The Complete plan tops you up with 1 TB of encrypted cloud storage and a few other tidbits. Surfshark\u2019s mid-tier plan includes Antivirus \u2013 awesome!\nHowever, implementing all of these features requires additional investment from these companies. If you work hard to implement a new feature, you\u2019ll want ROI, which produces higher costs for the end-user. As you\u2019ll see, this isn\u2019t always the case but in most cases, it is.\nServer Network Size\nMaintaining a huge server park takes a LOT of money and work. Imagine having tens of thousands of servers, the majority of which must function properly and be ready for you. This takes a load of maintenance and careful planning, which exudes a lot of time.\nTime is money nowadays and hard work must be paid for. That\u2019s why having plenty of servers can potentially raise the cost. If you wonder how much is a VPN with the most servers, however, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s not that much \u2013 around $2 a month (Private Internet Access).\nThat doesn\u2019t mean all providers with large server fleets are affordable. Some will cost more, especially if you want a dedicated IP address or \u201cnon-typical\u201d servers for special needs. A good example of a correlation between a large server network and the price is a free VPN.\nFree providers rarely offer more than 100 or 200 servers in a few countries. Paid providers offer hundreds of countries and thousands of servers. Why? Because they earn more money and can afford them!\nTorrenting & Streaming Prowess\nDo you want to download torrents in privacy, not worrying about your snooping ISP? You got it. Do you want streaming on Netflix, HBO, and BBC iPlayer without geo-blocks? You got it as well. Just be aware you\u2019ll need to PAY for these providers. They\u2019re not free.\nTo be clear, the cost of a VPN subscription isn\u2019t always tied to these factors. However, some providers with better streaming and torrenting prowess will cost more. Again, we can mention free providers that don\u2019t work for these purposes compared to paid ones.\nTorrenting and streaming are some of the most popular reasons to use a VPN. Providers capitalize on this by sometimes charging you slightly more. However, the enjoyment level is higher when you can enjoy P2P and stream on all devices, even on the fly.\nHow Much Does a VPN Cost? Most Popular VPNs Compared\nNow that you\u2019ve got the basic principles of VPN prices, it\u2019s time to get on with our analysis. By far THE most influencing factor is the subscription length, which is clearly displayed in the table below, where we compared the prices of 20 popular providers.\nAs you can see, monthly plans are way more expensive compared to others.\n| Provider | Monthly Price | Six Months Price | Annual Price | Biennial Price | Triennial Price |\n| NordVPN | $12.99 | $4.99 | $3.09 | ||\n| ExpressVPN | $12.95 | $9.99 | $6.67 | ||\n| Private Internet Access | $11.95 | $7.50 | $2.03 | ||\n| Proton VPN | $9.99 | $3.99 | $3.59 | ||\n| Surfshark | $15.45 | $2.99 | $2.19 | ||\n| CyberGhost | $6.99 | $2.03 | |||\n| Hide.me | $9.95 | $4.57 | $2.69 | ||\n| IPVanish | $12.99 | $3.33 | $2.19 | ||\n| TunnelBear | $9.99 | $4.99 | $3.33 | ||\n| Hotspot Shield | $9.99 | $6.67 | |||\n| PureVPN | $12.95 | $3.99 | $2.14 | ||\n| Ivacy VPN | $12.95 | $3.99 | $2.14 | ||\n| PrivateVPN | $9.99 | $2.00 | |||\n| Speedify | $14.99 | $7.49 | $4.99 | ||\n| Windscribe | $9.00 | $5.75 | |||\n| PrivadoVPN | $10.99 | $2.99 | $1.99 | ||\n| Mullvad | $5.52 | $5.52 | $5.52 | $5.52 | $5.52 |\n| VyprVPN | $10 | $5 | $3 | ||\n| Avast SecureLine VPN | $4.59 | $4.39 | $4.39 |\nOn the other hand, we have great biennial plans that go as low as roughly $2 a month. Many of them even come with 50-plus percent discounts and a few free months, which technically drop the price further. Very few providers at the moment offer longer plans as 2 years seem to be the sweet spot.\nWe\u2019d like to separate a few VPN providers from the pack:\n- NordVPN at just over $3/mo\n- ExpressVPN at $6.6/mo\n- Private Internet Access at just over $2/mo\n- Proton VPN at just over $3.5/mo\n- Surfshark at just over $2/mo\n- CyberGhost at just over $2/mo\nThese five are the best you can get. NordVPN, in particular, is the #1-rated VPN in 2025, yet, its price seems to be among the lowest. The second-best is ExpressVPN but its price is nearly $6.7 a month. We\u2019ll also address the third-best, which is PIA, costing only $2 a month.\nWe can see that the best VPN options don\u2019t cost much. This is great news for those wondering how much is a VPN and if they have to spend a fortune. They don\u2019t, as long as they opt for long-term plans and choose to save more from 50% to 86%.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to explore our table above fully and meticulously analyze the prices. You\u2019ll see a recurring trend of long-term plans being cheaper and costing no more than $8/mo.\nExpensive vs Cheap VPNs: Should You Always Pay More?\nWe\u2019ve noticed a few trends outside the VPN marketplace. Food, tech, and vehicles that cost more are usually better, with higher quality standards. Buying a cheap, half-rotten chicken will get you as far as the first medical center. VPNs are a bit different.\nA paid VPN IS indeed better than a free one. However, a cheaper provider usually isn\u2019t worse than a more expensive one, unless we\u2019re talking a suspiciously cheap option. We\u2019ll take NordVPN as the numero uno option and Astrill VPN, which can be $30 a month.\nNordVPN costs roughly 9 times LESS while providing more. It\u2019s not only more popular but also equipped with a Double VPN, Threat Protection, unlimited bandwidth, 6,400+ servers, and much more. Astrill VPN\u2019s only advantage is working in China slightly better.\nIf you factor in its bonus add-ons, the price can go well over $40 a month, unless you pay for its 2-year plan and end up with $12.5 a month. Racking up all of NordVPN\u2019s add-ons can cost you as much as $14.99 for the monthly plan and as low as $5.5 for the 2-year plan.\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the higher cost of some providers. As you see in the table above, Hotspot Shield is far from an affordable option but even further from the best. The same goes for Urban VPN, a free provider with a premium plan at nearly $8 and poor quality.\nSo, how much does a VPN cost to get the best possible outcome? It can be, again, anywhere from $2/mo to $7/mo. At the time of writing, the top-rated picks, on average, will cost you way under $4 monthly for their 2-year and sometimes 1-year plans.\nHow to Cut the Total VPN Cost? Money-Saving Tips\nWe all look for ways to save money, especially with today\u2019s prices of food, bills, and other basics. This rings true for non-essential things, some of which are VPNs. Here are a few honest tips from our experts on how to get the most out of them and not spend much.\nGo for Long-Term Plans\nYou don\u2019t have to have eagle-like eyesight to see that long-term plans yield the best savings. To save the most money per month, it\u2019s easiest to pick a 1-year or 2-year plan, pay upfront for the entire thing, and forget about it until the next billing cycle.\nInstead of paying over $11 a month, you\u2019ll pay $2 or $3, resulting in staggering savings. This is great for people who want long-term privacy and security. They\u2019ll get everything they need and reduce the price of the VPN, which is a win-win situation.\nDon\u2019t Always Pick the Cheapest Plan\nOkay \u2013 we know this is a bit contradictory but hear us out. Long-term plans are the cheapest, which we discussed in our recommended Black Friday VPN deals (don\u2019t miss them if Black Friday is around the corner!). But some people don\u2019t need a long subscription. They, perhaps, need a VPN briefly.\nIf you\u2019re in China for a week or two, you might need this service to bypass censorship. People on vacation abroad might need it to access local TV channels from their countries of origin. Such cases call for short-term plans that seem to be much more befitting.\nInstead of paying $80 or so for 2 years, they can pay $11 to $15 for the monthly plan. While it\u2019s more expensive per month, you\u2019re paying for ONE month only \u2013 not 24 \u2013 leaving you with dozens of dollars in your bank account. Think about this.\nWould you buy 10 pounds of apples at $0.5 per pound or a pound of apples at $2? You\u2019d likely opt for the latter because only a lunatic can mow down five pounds of apples before they\u2019re devoured by worms!\nUse a Free Trial\nGetting a free trial is another option you can consider. We answered your \u201cHow much does a VPN cost\u201d question but we haven\u2019t mentioned you don\u2019t always need to pay. NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Private Internet Access, and the rest of the \u201cpack\u201d have nifty free trials.\nThey\u2019re not long and last about 7 days. However, you can opt for them, provide your credit card, and NOT be charged until these 7 days are out. This means you can use the VPN for free, see whether you like it, and cancel your trial before you\u2019re charged.\nTest NordVPN For Free for 30 Days\nIsn\u2019t this a great money-saving tip? You get to use a premium provider without spending a single dollar! If you\u2019re unsure how to do this, read our VPN free trial tutorial which goes into detail on this topic, and thank us later.\nWhat About Lifetime VPN Plans?\nThese are very rare and not many providers offer them. At the time, we can only think of two:\n- Keepsolid VPN Unlimited at $199.99\n- FastestVPN at $40\nThese prices differ a lot but you can\u2019t deny both deals look attractive. Lifetime means you\u2019ll pay once and get to use the service as you exist (or the VPN). When something is too good to be true, it usually isn\u2019t, and most experts agree on the irrelevancy of lifetime plans.\nCompanies that offer such plans have low-quality VPN services that won\u2019t meet your demands. Above all, their existence is unsure because they don\u2019t attract many customers. Think about NordVPN or ExpressVPN \u2013 why don\u2019t they offer lifetime deals?\nBecause they don\u2019t need to! They have a steady stream of customers and millions of users, enough to sustain them for decades. When you\u2019re desperate, you\u2019re using all your power to keep the user stream going, and lifetime plans sound like a perfect deal.\nThe worst that could happen is the company disappearing with your money. You\u2019ve paid for the service, and now, you can\u2019t use it anymore. The company will vanish with all the money, which sounds like a perfect crime. Besides, lifetime plans make no sense to us.\nEven annual and biennial plans are very affordable and will cost a few dollars a month. You\u2019re not making huge savings by going lifetime, especially since you won\u2019t like what you get. Imagine the slog of using a poor-quality VPN just because you paid for it \u2013 yikes!\nHow Much Does a VPN Cost in 2025: Our Final Verdict\nSo, to recap, let\u2019s again answer the question of how much is a VPN. For those with the child\u2019s attention span, the answer is roughly $2 to $7 a month. Sometimes less, sometimes more. It all depends on the subscription plan length and a few additional features.\nThe best-case scenario is getting a long-term plan and making significant savings. However, if you need the service for a month or two, using a monthly plan can be beneficial. One is certain. You don\u2019t have to belong to the Rothschild family to afford a VPN.\n7492 servers\n118 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n10 simultaneous connections\n9.4 /10\n3000 servers\n105 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n8 simultaneous connections\n9.1 /10\n27000 servers\n91 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n9 /10"

      "text": "A proper Surfshark vs NordVPN comparison will help you decide which provider should be your next choice. If you\u2019re considering one, you\u2019re in the right place. These are among the best affordable VPNs available, offering excellent value for money, security, and privacy.\nSurfshark is renowned for its competitively priced 2-year plans, unlimited simultaneous connections, and advanced security features. NordVPN, on the other hand, is an all-around performer, excelling in every aspect from safety and privacy to streaming, torrenting, and bypassing censorship.\nA few years ago, NordVPN and Surfshark collaborated to enhance their services collectively. Therefore, this NordVPN vs Surfshark comparison for 2025 promises to be compelling, as we evaluate these two allies to determine the superior choice.\nBefore you commit to either option, we recommend reading this comprehensive analysis to the end. Both providers offer exceptional features, which we will detail in our comparison of Surfshark and NordVPN. Let\u2019s find out who claims the throne!\nSurfshark vs NordVPN: Overview\nAfter testing both providers side-by-side, we concluded that NordVPN is better than Surfshark and should be your go-to option. However, here\u2019s a brief overview of their features if you don\u2019t have time to read the entire NordVPN vs Surfshark comparison.\n| Surfshark | NordVPN | |\n| Our Current Ranking | #4 | #1 |\n| Prices | starting at $2.19/mo | starting at $3.39/mo |\n| Money-Back Guarantee | 30 Days | 30 Days |\n| Free Version | No | No |\n| Logging | No | No |\n| Protocols | OpenVPN, IKEv2, WireGuard | NordLynx, OpenVPN |\n| Servers | 3,200 in 100 countries | 6,400 in 111 countries |\n| Specialty Servers | MultiHop, Static IP | Double VPN, Obfuscated, Onion Over VPN, P2P |\n| RAM-Only Servers | Yes | Yes |\n| Working With Netflix | Yes (30+ catalogs) | Yes (20+ catalogs) |\n| P2P Allowance | Yes | Yes |\n| Simultaneous Connections | Unlimited | 10 |\nApplications & Ease of Use\nThis comparison starts with the evaluation of their apps and compatibility. Let\u2019s discuss the latter first. Both VPNs excel in this department, offering applications for all platforms. This makes them great for desktop, mobile, tablet, and laptop users.\nSupported platforms include:\n- Windows\n- Linux\n- macOS\n- Android\n- iOS\n- Routers\n- Smart TVs\n- Apple TV\n- Firestick, and so on\u2026\nWe love their native Firestick VPN apps, as they\u2019re ideal for streaming geo-blocked content. On top of that, both providers work on an array of router models, so you can use them to protect all devices in your household. What about concurrent connections?\nWell, Surfshark is better than NordVPN here. It offers unlimited connections, while NordVPN is capped at 10. While not impressive by any means, it\u2019s way ahead of ExpressVPN and CyberGhost, for instance. Ease of use is a strength in both providers, so it\u2019s a huge plus.\nSurfshark\u2019s desktop app looks funky and professional simultaneously. It\u2019s snappy and easy to use, alas, with a few cases of longer connection times on Windows. Its mobile apps are state-of-the-art, offering plenty of features to enjoy on the go. NordVPN takes the lead here.\nWe think it looks better and is snappier than its rival. This applies to all platforms. NordVPN, for example, takes 1-2 seconds to connect. It\u2019s also decorated with a world map of servers that you can use to connect. Better yet, it feels sleeker and is slightly more intuitive.\nDuring our Surfshark vs NordVPN evaluation, we thoroughly enjoyed both providers\u2019 apps. While Surfshark beats its rival in simultaneous connections, NordVPN\u2019s overall functionality is slightly better. This makes the initial round of the comparison a draw.\nSurfshark vs NordVPN: Price Comparison\nWe praised Surfshark\u2019s very affordable nature in our review. However, we drew the same conclusion for NordVPN as well! Starting with the shark that loves surfing, its price is dangerously close to $2/mo at the time of writing. We\u2019re discussing its 24-month plan.\nThere are three tiers \u2013 Starter, One, and One+. The Starter plan isn\u2019t very attractive features-wise because it lacks many that we\u2019ll mention later. The One plan is extremely good, and at under $2.7/mo with 3 extra months, you\u2019re getting even its antivirus and other good stuff.\nSurfshark\u2019s 12-month plans are ridiculously affordable. The One plan, again, shines, at over $3.1 a month with 3 extra months. Bear in mind that ExpressVPN\u2019s equivalent costs $6.67 \u2013 above TWO times more! Sadly, its monthly plans start at over $15 \u2013 quite expensive.\nNordVPN\u2019s 2-year plans are more expensive but they\u2019re very valuable. The Basic 2-year plan starts at around $3.4 and already includes plenty of features of NordVPN. The Plus plan is the one you want, with malware protection, ad blocker, and other premium features.\nSadly, it\u2019s over $4.3 a month, making it a lot more expensive than Surfshark. NordVPN\u2019s 1-year plans are also discounted but slightly less. The Plus plan, which is the best value, is around $6 a month. Compared to Surfshark\u2019s $3.1+ a month price, it\u2019s\u2026 well, expensive.\nIn this NordVPN vs Surfshark duel, it\u2019s good to mention a 30-day money-back guarantee on both sides. It applies to all plans and lets you get a full refund in no time. Payment methods are identical \u2013 pretty much \u2013 and you\u2019ll get options like PayPal, crypto, and debit cards.\nThis round goes to Surfshark because it\u2019s way cheaper than NordVPN.\nNordVPN vs Surfshark Features\nOur Surfshark vs NordVPN price comparison might be enough for you to decide. Well, we wouldn\u2019t rush to conclusions just yet. These providers are brimming with features waiting for you to explore them. We\u2019ll help you a bit by explaining how they work.\nShared Features\nGiven the \u201cbuddies\u201d status of these services, they share an awful lot of security features. They include:\n- Bank-grade encryption. The strongest encryption \u2013 also titled 256-bit AES encryption. It\u2019s a standard in premium VPNs that specialize in privacy and security. Being impenetrable and in this case, amplified by Perfect Forward Secrecy, it\u2019s easy to see why popular options like these use it.\n- Double VPN/MultiHop. This is the same feature present in both VPNs. It doubles your encryption by routing your traffic through two servers in different countries. As a result, the speed is slightly slower but the level of security rises significantly.\n- Ad Blocker. Both VPNs can block ads, trackers, and malicious sites. NordVPN\u2019s ad blocker is part of its Advanced Protection, while Surfshark has CleanWeb.\n- Kill Switch. This is an integral part of both providers. NordVPN\u2019s kill switch historically works better because its rival struggled with its malfunctions in the past. NordVPN also includes an App Kill Switch, which Surfshark lacks.\n- Obfuscation/NoBorders. It\u2019s great for avoiding censorship and getting over firewalls. NordVPN\u2019s obfuscated servers are in all apps (except mobile) and Surfshark\u2019s NoBorders mode is as easy to turn on \u2013 a win-win situation.\n- Dark Web Monitor/Alerts. This feature is great for getting alerted about leaked credentials. You can react immediately and resolve the problem to avoid data theft. Both features are available in these VPNs\u2019 mid-tier plans.\n- Split Tunneling. Quite a handy feature if you want to exclude certain apps from using a VPN tunnel. Or perhaps include only specific apps. Not unique but very useful.\n- Dedicated IP. Both providers offer dedicated IPs for purchase in multiple locations. Surfshark\u2019s dedicated IPs are cheaper than NordVPN\u2019s.\n- RAM Servers. Finally, they use RAM-only servers for the ultimate privacy. RAM servers lose their data with each reboot, so no information stays on the server for long.\nUnique Features\nDespite all the similarities, these providers have their \u201cpersonality\u201d and still offer something unique. NordVPN has the NordLynx protocol, which is an improved version of WireGuard. Surfshark went with the \u201cplain\u201d WireGuard but with some tweaks to make it more dependable.\nOther protocols include OpenVPN and IKEv2 on both sides. NordVPN\u2019s offers don\u2019t end there. Its Threat Protection includes real-time protection against malicious files and trackers. Surfshark has an antivirus that works incredibly well on all devices.\nSurprisingly, it\u2019s even better than NordVPN\u2019s Threat Protection at detecting malignancies. Surfshark also includes the Search browser, which is a bespoke \u201cincognito\u201d mode for browsing without ISP monitoring. This feature is in the One and One+ plans.\nSurfshark comes with the IP Rotation function to rotate your IP periodically while keeping your connection intact. This means you can\u2019t be tracked even by NSA-level hackers. NordVPN punches back with Meshnet, which can be used in many interesting ways.\nIt\u2019s good for remote control, remote access, and even file sharing. We love that Surfshark includes Static IPs but security-wise, they don\u2019t do a whole lot. Security-wise, it\u2019s hard to tell who is the winner because they offer amazing features not found in many other VPNs.\nHowever, NordVPN is slightly better than Surfshark because of a few \u201cextras\u201d, particularly Meshnet, which seals the deal for many users looking to expand upon basic VPN functions.\nDo NordVPN and Surfshark Store Logs?\nStoring logs is an unattractive characteristic of many free VPNs. Thankfully, neither of them is free, which sort of implies that none of them keep logs! Examining the privacy policies of NordVPN and Surfshark, we can clearly see minimal logging practices.\nThese VPNs won\u2019t store information like:\n- Your IP address\n- DNS requests\n- Timestamps\n- Connection logs\n- Geolocation\n- Traffic metadata, and so on\u2026\nWe must say we\u2019re impressed with the level of privacy both display. After examining the part about logging, both providers do well with very few bits of information. They\u2019re limited to troubleshooting data and things like your payment info and email.\nNow, both offer some \u201cextras\u201d that might require some more information. In particular, both contain anti-malware/antivirus, so scanning your computer for threats is naturally going to be \u201cprivacy-unfriendly\u201d. This issue is resolved by anonymizing your data.\nEven if something arrives at these VPNs\u2019 servers, this information is in an anonymized form, plus, all data is wiped quickly, as soon as it\u2019s not needed anymore. Besides, both providers have RAM-exclusive servers, so they can easily restart them and wipe all information.\nJurisdictions are quite different. NordVPN is in Panama, which is better than Surfshark\u2019s Netherlands. NordVPN also has very significant audits from PwC and Deloitte. Surfshark has been audited by Deloitte and Cure53, so we\u2019re talking about equal providers.\nSo, which provider to choose for privacy and no logging, NordVPN or Surfshark? Both are amazing, which is why this round is yet another tie.\nWhich VPN Is Faster: Surfshark or NordVPN?\nIf we exclude security and privacy, speed is perhaps one of the most important aspects of a VPN service. Today\u2019s Surfshark vs NordVPN comparison for 2025 takes us to another vital face-off, which is all about performance. Before we proceed, we\u2019ll mention a few things\nThe first thing is our location at the time of testing. We were in Europe, using a pretty fast internet connection with download and upload speeds of over 340 Mbps and 19 Mbps respectively. Here are our results:\nAfter performing this test without using a VPN, we did the following. We tested both providers for 3 days in a row, 3 times a day, using 3 locations \u2013 the UK, the US, and Japan. Since both offer very fast protocols, we used them for our test.\nTo translate, Surfshark\u2019s WireGuard and NordVPN\u2019s NordLynx were used. We also performed our tests on our Windows computer as these VPNs work very well on Windows and it was also easier to perform our tests on this platform.\nHere\u2019s the average speed reduction of both providers based on our tests:\n| Download Speed Loss | Upload Speed Loss | |\n| Surfshark | 27% | 32% |\n| NordVPN | 18% | 7% |\nThe table above favors NordVPN as the faster of the two. It was quite faster in both download and upload performance, however, the difference is even larger in the latter case. Surfshark\u2019s 32% drop in upload performance was indeed alarming.\nGet the best speeds with NordVPN\nNordVPN, on the other hand, stayed composed, with its average speed reduction never going over 20%. Even in practice, the Panamanian VPN performed much better thanks to not only faster overall speeds but also lower latency.\nHere are their complete speed test results across all three locations where you can see how they performed during our 3-day testing.\n| UK (Download/Upload) | US (Download/Upload) | Japan (Download/Upload) | |\n| Surfshark | 306.48/16.97 Mbps | 253.79/12.47 Mbps | 191.07/10.90 Mbps |\n| NordVPN | 324.25/18.68 Mbps | 292.75/18.31 Mbps | 223.54/17.85 Mbps |\nStreaming & Torrenting\nAfter our performance evaluation, our Surfshark vs NordVPN duel moves in another direction. In two, to be precise \u2013 streaming and torrenting. As they\u2019re respectable premium providers, you\u2019d expect awesome performance from both. Here\u2019s how they truly perform.\nStreaming\nStreaming is first and here, we have one amazing surprise. NordVPN performs exceptionally well, unblocking over 20 Netflix catalogs, BBC iPlayer, Hotstar, and dozens of other streaming platforms. It also works with TV channels abroad \u2013 ITV is one of them.\nWe must praise NordVPN\u2019s unblocking abilities on all platforms. Having tested it on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS, we can report its apps are equally capable of jumping over geo-blocks. NordVPN\u2019s inclusion of Smart DNS is more than welcome.\nIt is, however, limited to US-based streaming services only. Surfshark includes Smart DNS too, which is a great move for a greater streaming variety. We mentioned one surprise, which is Surfshark\u2019s overwhelmingly powerful streaming ability that overshadows even NordVPN.\nSurfshark works with 30 or more Netflix catalogs, which surpasses its rival. For instance, the provider can help you access Netflix Turkey, which many providers can\u2019t \u2013 we can mention ExpressVPN in this regard. Other streaming platforms are easily accessible as well.\nInterestingly, these providers don\u2019t have dedicated streaming servers, which makes things more impressive. This means out-of-the-box optimization is already perfect for watching content online. While both are impressive, Surfshark has a slight edge because it unblocks more Netflix libraries.\nTorrenting\nTorrenting and P2P activities are enjoyable regardless of the provider you choose. NordVPN\u2019s P2P servers are excellent, offering impressive speeds and stability for daily downloads. After testing them multiple times, we found that speed reductions are non-existent, which is awesome.\nWe used nearby servers in Europe to download torrents without hassle. NordVPN even has the SOCKS5 proxy that you can combine with torrent clients for slightly better performance. Surfshark also works for torrenting on all of its servers. That\u2019s nice to have.\nThere\u2019s no port forwarding or other extras to enhance torrenting. In our experience, this \u201cextra\u201d is unnecessary if you\u2019re already using a fast P2P VPN such as these two. NordVPN and Surfshark are P2P-friendly but the former is slightly faster, as expected.\nThat\u2019s why NordVPN is a tad better than Surfshark for P2P. Given the outcome of the streaming comparison, which was in Surfshark\u2019s favor, the torrenting/streaming round ended up in a tie, as you can\u2019t really go wrong with any of them.\nServer Locations of Surfshark and NordVPN\nHaving a large server park isn\u2019t necessarily better if the server quality is lacking. Luckily for us, this isn\u2019t the case here. NordVPN and Surfshark have 10 Gbps RAM-only servers, resulting in the best possible experience. NordVPN has 6,400+ servers in 110+ countries.\nIt includes specialty servers we already mentioned plus dedicated IP addresses to make things varied. We can only praise this server network, which excels in aspects like security, privacy, and speed. NordVPN\u2019s servers are distributed well, so it\u2019s another plus.\nIt even has Indian VPN servers that fully work with Hotstar and other India-locked content abroad. We appreciate its Onion over VPN servers too that people mostly use to visit the dark web through Tor. Surfshark offers 3,200 servers in 100 countries.\nIt effectively has twice as less servers as its rival, so it\u2019s at a disadvantage. However, this number isn\u2019t critically small and won\u2019t produce overcrowding and not being able to find a fast server for you. It doesn\u2019t have specialty servers, so it\u2019s less versatile, in a way.\nLike its rival, Surfshark possesses dedicated IP addresses but also static IPs, which you won\u2019t find in NordVPN. The provider has 10 countries less than NordVPN, which isn\u2019t too alarming considering its amazing server distribution across every continent.\nNordVPN wins this round because of a significantly larger, yet equally reliable server network with specialty servers.\nBypassing Censorship: Which VPN Does It Better?\nAvoiding censorship is never easy, especially in China. The Great Firewall trumps even some of the best providers, one of which is CyberGhost. Well, if you\u2019re using CyberGhost, it might be great to swap it for NordVPN which uses obfuscated servers. They\u2019re extremely good!\nHaving tested them in China, we concluded that obfuscated servers can indeed get over the firewall. There\u2019s a minor speed drop because of all the encryption and stuff going on in the background. However, the performance is sublime for all purposes, gaming included.\nSurfshark uses NoBorders to achieve the same effect. It\u2019s obfuscation applied to your connection, masking it, and making it look like a normal connection. This effectively lets you get over the Great Firewall and use it in China hassle-free. It\u2019s efficient in practice.\nBut we noticed that it\u2019s slightly less reliable than NordVPN, with a few connection problems here and there. That\u2019s usually resolved by using Open VPN TCP, which is often better for firewall bypassing. The main thing is that both can be used in China.\nNordVPN is a bit better, generally speaking. Other countries like Iran, the UAE, Turkey, and Russia aren\u2019t problematic for either. Their censorship means aren\u2019t as strong as China\u2019s, so both can work efficiently and without connection issues.\nConclusion: NordVPN Wins Against Surfshark\nNow that we have all the cards on the table, it\u2019s time to sift through them and see which provider is better \u2013 Surfshark or NordVPN. Well, if we do the math, we can see that NordVPN won the comparison by beating Surfshark in most cases.\nNordVPN is faster, offers more servers, and is better at bypassing censorship. Surfshark is cheaper, offers unlimited connections, and is slightly better for Netflix. Other aspects, such as torrenting, security, privacy, and compatibility are a tie, making the VPNs some of the best choices around.\nIn the end, our ultimate choice would be NordVPN. It\u2019s better and only slightly more expensive than Surfshark. Having more servers and being way faster is important to us. If you\u2019re more value-inclined and want to save as much money as you can, it\u2019s okay.\nIn that case, you can opt for Surfshark but an even better option is Private Internet Access. At just over $2/mo, it\u2019s also packed with unlimited connections, rock-solid security, and strong privacy. Still not better than NordVPN but superior to Surfshark overall."

      "text": "When it comes to keeping your online activities private, a VPN is your best friend. It is a service, like an app of sorts, that encrypts your data and hides your IP address, creating a secure tunnel between your device and the internet. But what happens if that tunnel suddenly collapses? Without a safety net, your sensitive information could be exposed. That\u2019s where a VPN kill switch steps in to save the day.\nA VPN kill switch is like an emergency brake for your secure internet connection. The moment your VPN connection drops, the kill switch jumps into action, cutting off your internet access. This keeps your IP address and other sensitive data hidden. It\u2019s a simple yet powerful feature that shields you from accidentally browsing the web without protection.\nWhile most premium VPNs include a kill switch, not all kill switches are the same. Some are more reliable and easier to use, which is why it\u2019s essential to choose a VPN that offers a top-notch kill switch.\nOur #1 recommendation for the best VPN with a kill switch is NordVPN. It offers one for specific apps and one for your entire system, so you can tailor your protection to suit your needs, whether you\u2019re torrenting, gaming, or just browsing. In this guide, we\u2019ll break down what a VPN kill switch is, why you need it, and which VPNs do it best.\nWhy Do You Need a VPN Kill Switch?\nWhen your VPN connection drops unexpectedly, your online activities can suddenly be exposed.\nThis is where a VPN kill switch becomes crucial. It acts as an emergency cut-off, instantly disconnecting you from the internet if your secure VPN connection fails. This keeps your real IP address, location, and any sensitive information hidden.\nProtecting Your Privacy in Critical Moments\nA VPN kill switch ensures that you never browse unprotected, even for a second. It\u2019s a safeguard against accidental exposure, making it especially valuable if you\u2019re accessing sensitive data or using public Wi-Fi.\nWithout a kill switch, a momentary lapse in connection can leave you vulnerable.\nAvoiding Data Leaks\nEven the best VPNs can sometimes drop their protection. When this happens, without a kill switch, your data could flow through an unsecured network, exposing your IP address and other personal information.\nA kill switch prevents this by shutting down your internet until the secure connection is reestablished, keeping your data safe.\nTypes of Kill Switches\nVPN kill switches come in different forms, each offering unique benefits:\n- System-Level Kill Switch- This type shuts down all internet activity on your device if the VPN drops. It\u2019s ideal for ensuring that no data leaks occur, especially when dealing with highly sensitive information.\n- Application-Level Kill Switch- This allows you to specify which apps should be cut off if the VPN fails. It\u2019s helpful if you want to continue browsing while ensuring that specific apps, like your torrent client or banking app, are fully protected.\n- Manual vs. Automatic Kill Switches- Some VPNs require you to manually enable the kill switch, while others automatically activate it when the VPN connection drops. Automatic switches are generally preferred for their ease of use and reliable protection.\nIn short, a VPN kill switch is not just an optional feature that you can do without. It\u2019s essential for maintaining your online privacy and security, especially in scenarios where even a brief exposure can have serious consequences.\nBest VPNs with a Kill Switch in 2025\nA VPN kill switch is a critical feature for anyone serious about online privacy. It ensures that your data remains protected even if your VPN connection drops. While many VPNs offer this feature, not all are created equal.\nIn this section, we\u2019ll explore the best VPNs that provide reliable and customizable kill switches, starting with NordVPN.\n7492 servers\n118 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n10 simultaneous connections\n9.4 /10\n3000 servers\n105 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n8 simultaneous connections\n9.1 /10\n27000 servers\n91 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n9 /10\n1. NordVPN\nWhen it comes to safeguarding your online privacy, having a reliable kill switch is non-negotiable. NordVPN delivers as the best Kill Switch VPN to get in 2025, offering this feature with impressive flexibility. NordVPN\u2019s kill switch is available across major platforms, including Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS.\nIt offers both system-level and application-level kill switches, giving you control over how your connection is protected. The system-level kill switch is particularly robust on Windows, where it can permanently block all traffic if the VPN connection drops, even if the VPN client is off. This ensures no accidental exposure of your IP address or data.\nFor those who prefer more tailored security, the application-level kill switch allows you to select specific apps that should be disconnected if the VPN fails, making it ideal for torrenting or secure transactions.\nBeyond its kill switch, NordVPN uses top-tier encryption (AES-256) and the fast NordLynx protocol, ensuring your connection remains secure and swift. With over 6,400+ servers in 111 countries, you\u2019ll have plenty of options for reliable connections and bypassing geo-restrictions.\nPricing starts at around $3 per month on long-term plans with a 30-day money-back guarantee, making NordVPN affordable and one of the most secure VPNs \u2014 ideal choice for those seeking comprehensive protection.\nPros\n- Kill switch available on multiple platforms\n- System-level and application-level kill switches\n- Strong encryption and fast speeds\n- Extensive server network\n- Competitive pricing with long-term plans\nCons\n- A permanent kill switch on Windows may be restrictive\n2. ExpressVPN\nExpressVPN is another top choice for its reliable kill switch, known as the Network Lock. Available across platforms like Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS, this kill switch is designed to block all internet traffic if your VPN connection drops unexpectedly.\nThe Network Lock kicks in automatically so that your IP address and online activity remain hidden until the VPN connection is restored. ExpressVPN uses AES-256 encryption combined with the Lightway protocol, providing both strong security and fast speeds. This makes ExpressVPN one of the most preferred VPNs with a kill switch.\nThis makes it an excellent option for streaming, gaming, or any activity where you need a stable and secure connection. With over 3,000 servers in 105 countries, ExpressVPN offers extensive global coverage, unblocks blocked websites and bypasses geo-restrictions, allowing you to access content from virtually anywhere.\nWhile ExpressVPN\u2019s pricing is on the higher side, starting at around $6 per month, its robust features, including the Network Lock, make it a worthy investment for those who need top-tier privacy protection.\nPros\n- Reliable kill switch across multiple platforms\n- Strong encryption with the Lightway protocol\n- Fast and stable connections\n- Extensive server network\n- 24/7 customer support\nCons\n- Higher cost compared to other VPNs\n- Not as many advanced features as NordVPN\n3. Private Internet Access\nPrivate Internet Access (PIA) offers one of the most robust and customizable VPN kill switches available. PIA\u2019s kill switch is available across all major platforms, including Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS.\nWhat makes PIA one of the best kill switch VPNs is the ability to choose between a standard kill switch and an advanced, permanent kill switch. While the standard one disconnects your internet when the VPN drops, the advanced mode blocks all traffic even when the VPN is off or the client is closed.\nThis advanced kill switch feature on Windows and macOS gives users on both platforms the highest level of security possible. The permanent kill switch assures that any potential IP leaks are eliminated, making it nearly impossible for your real IP address to be exposed.\nPrivate Internet Access also uses top-tier encryption protocols, including AES-256, to keep your data secure. With over 29,000 servers in 91 countries, PIA provides extensive global coverage for a safe and fast connection from almost anywhere.\nPIA\u2019s pricing is also highly competitive, with plans starting at around $2 per month. This makes it one of the affordable VPNs with a kill switch that offers both security and flexibility.\nTry Private Internet Access Now\nPros\n- Kill switch available on multiple platforms\n- Standard and permanent kill switch options\n- Strong encryption with customizable settings\n- Affordable pricing with long-term plans\nCons\n- A permanent kill switch may be overly restrictive\n- Could be better for unblocking streaming services\nHow to Enable a VPN Kill Switch: Step-by-Step Tutorial\nEnabling a VPN kill switch is straightforward, but the exact steps can vary depending on the VPN service you\u2019re using. We\u2019ll use NordVPN as an example to guide you through activating this crucial feature on a Windows 11 system.\nStep 1: Download and Install NordVPN\nIf you haven\u2019t already, download and install the NordVPN app on your device. NordVPN is available on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. Once installed, log in with your NordVPN credentials.\nStep 2: Access the Settings Menu and Locate the Kill Switch\nOpen the NordVPN app and navigate to the settings menu. On Windows and macOS, you\u2019ll typically find this by clicking the gear icon in the top-right corner of the app. On mobile devices, you might need to tap the hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) to access the settings. In the settings menu, locate the \u201cKill Switch\u201d option.\nStep 3: Choose the Type of Kill Switch\nNordVPN offers two types of kill switches: system-level and application-level. The Internet Kill Switch will block all internet traffic if the VPN connection drops.\nTo enable it, simply toggle the switch on. If you prefer to block internet access only for specific apps, select the App Kill Switch option and choose which apps should be cut off if the VPN disconnects.\nStep 4: Save Your Settings\nAfter selecting your preferred kill switch type, make sure to save your settings. NordVPN usually applies these settings automatically, but it\u2019s always a good idea to double-check.\nTo confirm your kill switch is working correctly, you can conduct a simple test. Connect to a NordVPN server, then disconnect from the VPN by manually turning off the VPN connection or simulating a network drop. If you\u2019ve set the kill switch to \u201cmanually,\u201d your internet connection should be cut off immediately until the VPN reconnects.\nSummary\nWhen it comes to safeguarding your online privacy, having a VPN with a reliable kill switch is essential. But, as we have discussed, not all VPN kill switches are created equal in this regard.\nNordVPN stands out as the best VPN with a kill switch if you want a highly customizable and effective solution. Its ability to offer both system-level and application-level kill switches across multiple platforms makes it a top choice.\nWhile ExpressVPN and Private Internet Access (PIA) also provide effective kill switch features, they cater to slightly different needs.\nFAQs\nWe\u2019ve sifted through the most common questions about VPN kill switches and answered them for you down below.\nWhy do I need a VPN kill switch?\nA VPN kill switch is crucial for ensuring your online privacy and security. Without it, if your VPN connection fails, your data could be transmitted over an unprotected network, leaving you vulnerable to hackers, ISPs, and other prying eyes.\nDoes the kill switch affect my internet speed?\nThe kill switch itself does not affect your internet speed. However, if the kill switch is triggered and your VPN connection drops, you will be disconnected from the internet until the VPN reconnects, which may temporarily interrupt your online activities.\nCan I use the VPN kill switch on mobile devices?\nYes, most top VPNs, including NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and PIA, offer a kill switch feature on mobile devices, such as Android and iOS. This ensures your mobile data remains secure, even on the go."

      "text": "Calling a VPN service best-rated is easier said than done for us. Yet, when you read a typical review of NordVPN, people who tested it first-hand frequently refer to it exactly like that. Every NordVPN test yields excellent results, seemingly making it the #1 VPN service to use. NordVPN is a pretty familiar service. It\u2019s a product of Nord Security \u2014 a well-known company. This provider built its strong reputation around three concrete pillars; security, privacy, and performance. However, the service is much more than this.\nThink of a 360-degree app for online protection, which is an accurate representation of this software. It\u2019s clear as day that we\u2019re discussing a powerful VPN service with plenty of experience in the industry. After all, you don\u2019t need this NordVPN test to know what it is.\nHowever, if you\u2019ve never used it, this in-depth NordVPN analysis will come in handy. Our team has been using it since its inception and is living through its various stages of improvement. We noticed vast improvements to the formula, especially in the past few years.\nThis implies a surge of advantages that the majority of users will enjoy. However, no VPN is perfect and this one still has a few shortcomings. Before you shell out your money on it, read our exhaustive NordVPN review to see what our experienced team of experts thinks of it.\nNordVPN\nAfter testing several dozen VPNs, we can say that NordVPN is the best VPN of [year]. With excellent speeds, a user-friendly app, and many advanced features, you won't lack anything by opting for their service. Moreover, it won't even cost you much.\nPros\n- Multiple third-party audits\n- AES-256 bank-grade encryption\n- Robust apps for all platforms\n- Double VPN servers for added security\n- 115+ server locations to pick from\n- Affordable and generous 2-year plans\n- Faster than any VPN we tested\nCons\n- No website split tunneling\n- Occasional connection problems on Windows & macOS\nNordVPN Features: A Quick Rundown\n| \ud83d\udcb8 Starting price | $3.09 a month for 24 months |\n| \ud83d\udd16 Money-back guarantee | 30 days |\n| \ud83c\udf10 Protocols | OpenVPN, NordWhisper, NordLynx, IKEv2 |\n| \ud83e\udd78 No-log policy | Yes |\n| \ud83d\udcbe Servers | 7,600+ in 118 countries |\n| \u23f8\ufe0f Double VPN | Yes |\n| \ud83e\udda0 Malware/ad/tracker protection | Yes (in the Plus plan and above) |\n| \ud83d\udcfa Streaming and P2P | Allowed |\n| \ud83d\udcaf Third-party audits | Yes (Deloitte and PwC) |\n| \ud83d\udcbb Supported platforms | Windows, iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, and more |\n| #\ufe0f\u20e3 Simultaneous connections | 10 |\n| \u260e\ufe0f Customer support | 24/7 live chat, email, help center |\nNordVPN Pricing: How Much Does It Cost?\nBefore trying out NordVPN and discussing our test results, let us talk about its prices.\nWe know many of you are wondering about the NordVPN cost and whether it\u2019s expensive. We\u2019ll say only one word \u2014 no. Bear in mind that the provider doesn\u2019t have a \u201cfixed\u201d price.\nThis means it frequently offers different discounts and deals, often including several free months. Speaking of that, at the moment of crafting this in-depth NordVPN review, this service offers 3 free months for its 2-year plans.\nWe can see that the service exudes unbelievably low prices close to $3 a month. The Basic plan is a good starting point. However, the best value deal on this service is the Plus plan with a price of around $4 a month.\nWhy?\nBecause it offers malware protection, tracker/ad blocker, and a few other features we tested in this review. We appreciate NordVPN for being an all-around cybersecurity suite. With a VPN and malware protection, at this price, you\u2019re not getting better software anywhere.\nThe Complete plan comes with Nord Security\u2019s reliable NordLocker encrypted cloud storage. You\u2019re getting 1 TB, which should be ample. At under $5 at the time of writing, this plan is on par, price-wise, with ExpressVPN\u2019s least expensive 2-year deal. Should we add that it\u2019s better, too?\nMoney-Back Guarantee and Free Trial\nWhen it comes to a money-back guarantee, the Panamanian giant is more than generous. All plans are subject to a 30-day refund policy. This allows you to enjoy the provider for 30 days, or not enjoy it if you dislike it, and call it quits, being reimbursed at the end.\nIn our years-long NordVPN use, we always appreciated this feature. You can get a refund no matter the reason. Even if you just don\u2019t need the service anymore. Contact the support team through live chat, explain the problem, and voila!\nThe provider doesn\u2019t offer a full-fledged free trial, though. This refund policy is sort of a free trial if you plan to get a refund. However, Android users who sign up on their phones get a 7-day trial, which we ended up appreciating in our NordVPN review.\nPayment Methods\nIf you\u2019ve already read our test of NordVPN, or at least the gist of it above, you might want to purchase it. In that case, you\u2019re looking at four payment methods:\n- Credit/debit cards\n- Google Pay\n- PayPal\n- Cryptocurrencies\nPick one, snag a discount on NordVPN\u2019s 2-year plan, and enjoy.\nEase of Use & Compatibility\nTo be frank, we love NordVPN\u2019s apps. They\u2019re modern. Cutting-edge in a way. However, beginners might find them slightly intimidating with all of the unknown features at first. Rest assured, the provider\u2019s apps are some of the simplest around.\nOnce you\u2019re on the server list, it takes one click to connect to a server. NordVPN\u2019s hastiness lets you connect in 1-2 seconds and conceal your IP address from the prying eyes. The mobile app, as you see, looks the same, at least aesthetics-wise.\nWe love that mobile users get almost the same features, even including Threat Protection Lite. In our experience, both iOS and Android apps are optimized well. Both sides have access to all of NordVPN\u2019s protocols which we\u2019ll discuss in this NordVPN review for 2025.\nOn the compatibility side, the provider doesn\u2019t disappoint.\nOne curiosity is that it allows for 10 simultaneous connections, which is more than ExpressVPN and CyberGhost. Being a highly appreciated service by millions of users, the provider\u2019s supported devices/systems include:\n- Windows, macOS, and Linux computers and laptops\n- iOS and Android smartphones and tablets\n- Fire TV, tvOS, and Android TV systems (including Nvidia Shield TV)\n- Routers (Asus, pfSense, Tomato, DD-WRT, Netduma, \u2026)\n- Gaming consoles like Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox\n- Firefox, Brave, Edge, and Chrome extensions\nWe\u2019ll briefly touch on NordVPN\u2019s extensions which are some of the best around. They offer full WebRTC protection and VPN-like capabilities for streaming, torrenting, and safe browsing (location spoofing, for example). Now that we\u2019re at it, explore our favorite Chrome VPN extensions here.\nSecurity Features of NordVPN\nOne of the reasons you\u2019re reading this NordVPN review and test is that you want to know whether it\u2019s safe and secure. More than 10 years ago when we started to use it, we wondered the same. Yet, even then, we quickly concluded that its safety is undeniable.\nWe tested and evaluated all of its security features. The list is mile-long, so let\u2019s make haste.\nBasic VPN Features\nNordVPN\u2019s basic features are mandatory and include:\n- 256-bit GCM encryption. It\u2019s the strongest encryption in the world, unbreakable even by NSA-level hackers.\n- Perfect Forward Secrecy. The provider utilizes PFS, generating unique encryption keys for every connection. As a result, it\u2019s impossible to trace the connection and read its contents. Even if this happens, when the user disables the VPN, the encryption key is useless, as it won\u2019t be assigned to either of the forthcoming connections.\n- Kill Switch. A standard feature in every VPN. In our NordVPN test, it worked well with a few connection problems we encountered. It shuts down your internet traffic to prevent IP leaks if the VPN connection breaks. NordVPN even offers an app-level kill switch to apply the same effect to chosen apps. We explained how the kill switch works in a separate guide.\n- Split tunneling. It\u2019s here to route specific apps through the encrypted tunnel or prevent them from using a VPN. In return, you can encrypt only the traffic from the apps that would benefit from additional security or location change. No website split tunneling can be found, which our team isn\u2019t so happy about.\n- DNS Filtering. Once you enable it, NordVPN will block malicious sites and ads, as long as you\u2019re connected to the VPN server. However, we don\u2019t like that NordVPN doesn\u2019t list the blocked threats to inform you about whether it truly works. In our test, we couldn\u2019t tell whether it truly works for the most part.\nAdvanced Security Features\nOur NordVPN analysis is empty without advanced security features that the provider is so proud of. Keep in mind we tested the service using the Plus plan, which includes all of the core and bonus functions.\nSpecialty Servers\nA quality server network isn\u2019t all about numbers. Sometimes, it\u2019s the specialty servers that significantly boost the experience. The provider includes the following servers:\n- Double VPN. This is by far our favorite feature of NordVPN. We use these servers pretty much daily. They route your traffic through two servers in different countries for double the encryption. NordVPN offers pre-built Double VPN locations for easier access, including the US-Canada, Netherlands-Switzerland, and so on. Our experience shows that Double VPN servers are slower because of stronger encryption but they\u2019re still capable of streaming and high-speed downloads.\n- Obfuscated Servers. They use OpenVPN TCP and obfuscation to get over firewalls. We used these servers in China and other censored regions. They work well to bypass DPI and enjoy free internet in the harshest conditions. Read our NordVPN review further to see how efficient these servers were in practice.\n- P2P Servers. As implied by the name, these are made for safe and secure torrent downloads. They\u2019re also optimized for speed and stability and can take full advantage of NordLynx to squeeze out every drop of performance.\n- Onion Over VPN Servers. These servers are in the Netherlands and Switzerland. They\u2019re used for Tor Over VPN connections when you want to ensure additional anonymity and privacy. You can use them for going on the dark web safely, for example.\nThreat Protection Pro\nUsers will be interested in trying out Threat Protection Pro. Well, our experience yet again shows that this nifty little feature works extremely well. On iOS and Android, it\u2019s titled \u201cThreat Protection Lite\u201d but is almost the same feature. The best experience is on macOS/Windows.\nIn this scenario, you\u2019ll get three protection levels:\n- Anti-malware\n- Advanced browsing protection\n- Ad and tracker blocker\nThe first is our favorite, as it protects you against malware thanks to real-time scanning. Even better, NordVPN will display blocked threats to showcase its efficiency. We liked the option to exclude certain domains because some sites won\u2019t function with tracking disabled.\nOur team appreciates the URL Cleaner function too. It\u2019s a unique part of Threat Protection Pro that trims web addresses and removes tracking parameters for added privacy. File Protection prevents malicious downloads similarly to Windows Defender.\nIf you don\u2019t prefer Windows Defender and Microsoft\u2019s tracking policies, this is a better alternative in our book. Lastly, Vulnerability Protection (part of anti-malware) detects vulnerable apps on your device by scanning them multiple times a day.\nAs you can see, it detected one during our extensive testing procedure, which we promptly updated afterward.\nNordLynx & NordWhisper VPN Protocols\nThe reason we put NordLynx in this section is because it\u2019s an advanced security protocol you\u2019ll find nowhere else. A proprietary solution like this takes WireGuard as a base and expands upon it to create a superior protocol.\nNordLynx is WireGuard\u2019s improvement in security, privacy, and performance done by NordVPN. This makes the protocol extremely fast and responsive, allowing for second-long connection times for a snappy experience. One of the trademark features, mind you!\nAs you\u2019ll see in our speed test results later on, NordLynx is impressive performance-wise.\nNevertheless, apart from this protocol, the provider includes three more, such as:\n- NordWhisper\n- OpenVPN TCP/UDP\n- IKEv2 (manual setup)\nNordWhisper is the newest protocol made by NordVPN for overcoming network filtering. During our extensive NordVPN review, we found it pretty efficient after testing it on a few censored networks. The protocol selection isn\u2019t the widest but it\u2019s still excellent.\nOpenVPN and IKEv2 are ideal for security while being slower than NordLynx. However, OpenVPN TCP is used by Obfuscated servers to bypass censorship, so it\u2019s pretty handy in many scenarios.\nYou can find more info about NordLynx on NordVPN\u2019s site if you want to explore this reliable protocol.\nDark Web Monitor\nThe Dark Web Monitor tool is another worthy addition. We tested this feature simply by enabling it, and oh boy, we had a few interesting findings. This tool alerts you to public exposure of your data online. By that, we mean data linked to your email and passwords.\nThe app immediately showed us three websites where our data was compromised. For privacy reasons, we can\u2019t show them but we saw info such as our usernames, IP addresses, and passwords. After this NordVPN review, we resolved these issues thanks to this feature.\nMeshnet\nYou do not often find a VPN feature worthy of a separate article. Meshnet is one of them. To be clear, it\u2019s not a security feature but nonetheless, we found it incredibly useful in our NordVPN review. This feature is excellent for file sharing and remote access.\nUsers can link up to 10 personal devices and up to 50 other users\u2019 devices. In doing so, a safe and secure device network can be weaved, where you can share files, remote-control devices, and so on. We like the option to use another device\u2019s IP address.\nLet\u2019s say you want to unblock a restricted site. You can connect to a friend in another country who also uses NordVPN. Once he enables Meshnet, connect to their device and route your traffic through the device\u2019s IP address.\nNow, you can access the site that works in his country but not yours. Meshnet allows for remote access, as said, so that you can fetch a file from another computer or phone too. Oh, one more thing. Meshnet works on ALL supported systems, including iOS and Android.\nThis enables the remote control/access to phones or tablets. Pretty handy if you, let\u2019s say, forget your phone/tablet at home where you have important business files. Our team used Meshnet in this case to transfer these files and have them at our fingertips.\nRAM-Only Servers\nRandom Access Memory, also known as RAM, is a staple of every high-quality provider. Our rich experience showed that RAM-only servers are far better than those based on traditional HDDs. Performance, security, and privacy are elevated significantly.\nNordVPN bases all of its servers on RAM \u2013 quite amazing news! RAM servers wipe their data with each reboot, ensuring nothing is left. We found the provider\u2019s profound understanding of the importance of privacy baffling, which explains why it\u2019s so popular.\nCoupled with a no-log policy, RAM servers are another vital measure that prevents even NordVPN from keeping your private data around.\nPrivate DNS\nThe provider also uses Private DNS servers. Instead of using third-party DNS providers, the provider opts for a proprietary DNS server that adheres to the no-log policy. It means your DNS queries won\u2019t be monitored and stored on the server.\nLet\u2019s compare this to third-party options. Free DNS providers are notorious for storing your DNS requests, so when a VPN uses any of them, it negates its privacy features. Once you connect to NordVPN\u2019s server, your every step online is shrouded in a 100% secure VPN connection.\nNordProtect\nWe left this feature for the end before testing for IP/DNS leaks for a reason. It\u2019s available only in the Prime plan for users in the EU, the UK, the US, Canada, and Switzerland. It\u2019s a third-party tool for removing your private data from brokers\u2019 databases.\nUsers can buy it separately, but we recommend it as part of the Prime plan at under $7/mo for the 24-month plan. NordProtect can remove your private data from 170+ data brokers but this number will increase in the future.\nIf you care deeply about your privacy, it can be handy to wipe out your online footprints more thoroughly.\nIP/DNS Leak Test: No Leaks Detected\nIt couldn\u2019t be clearer that this is one of the top services for overall security. Our NordVPN test also showed the absence of IP and DNS leaks. We connected to a random US server and tested the service using two websites \u2013 ipleak.net and browserleaks.com.\nThe results above show the first website, where the provider completely concealed our original IP/DNS addresses and replaced them with the US counterparts.\nAgain, the second website showcases the same excellent results. Just to be clear, we tested all 118+ countries and had ZERO leaks with NordVPN. However, for the sake of simplicity of this review and test, we included a few screenshots.\nDoes NordVPN Keep Logs?\nDo you want a short or long answer? Here\u2019s the short one \u2013 NO. The provider is based in one of the most privacy-friendly jurisdictions: Panama. We all know Panama as an off-shore location whose privacy laws are way different than those in the US or the UK.\nIt\u2019s a country far away from the 5 Eyes, as well. Nord Security is a reputable company too, unlike Gaditek which owns PureVPN. Judging only by these factors, the provider isn\u2019t forced into storing logs and tracking your online footsteps.\nBut is this truly the case? Let\u2019s review the privacy policy of NordVPN.\nNordVPN\u2019s Privacy Policy Review\nOn its site, the provider claims not to keep any logs. This rings true in the privacy policy too. When it comes to the information that isn\u2019t kept, it includes:\n- IP address\n- DNS requests\n- Browsing history\n- Used bandwidth\n- Traffic logs\nThis is enough to conclude and confirm its no-logs practices. Of course, every provider must store at least something to function properly. When you use NordVPN, it will store your username and a timestamp of the last session status. Justifiably so.\nThis information helps the provider enforce its simultaneous connection limit and is wiped 15 minutes after the connection has stopped. Other stored information includes server load, and anonymized data, such as device information, active subscriptions, and so on.\nNow, using other non-VPN features is another story \u2014 the one we must clarify in this NordVPN review. Threat Protection Pro, for example, must scan visited URLs and apps on your device if you\u2019re using Vulnerability Protection or File Protection.\nThe good news is that the provider doesn\u2019t directly store this information. Instead, it\u2019s either briefly on the server in an anonymized form or isn\u2019t stored at all and is quickly wiped. How can we confirm this, you might be wondering.\nThird-Party Audits\nWith a third-party security audit! NordVPN currently has a few of them, coming from PwC and Deloitte. At the time of testing the service for this NordVPN review, the service counts four of them in 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2023 \u2014 there will likely be more.\nIndependent audits like these are important for trustworthiness. In this case, PwC and Deloitte audited not only a no-log policy but various security features, infrastructure, and so on. With pristine results on its hands, NordVPN is a paramount VPN for overall privacy.\nNordVPN Review: Server Locations\nPeople usually associate the provider\u2019s size with quality. While this isn\u2019t always the case, NordVPN\u2019s larger server fleet indeed brims with reliability and sublime performance. With over 7,600+ servers in 118 countries, it\u2019s hard not to be impressed.\nThe provider uses RAM servers, as explained, but Dedicated IPs are there too. It\u2019s good to have Smart DNS addresses as well. They\u2019re nifty for streaming and let you unblock streaming portals without installing the VPN.\nNordVPN\u2019s server selection is stellar because it covers all continents. For example, you\u2019ll find VPN servers in the UAE, which aren\u2019t present in ExpressVPN. We like the addition of Indian servers, which weren\u2019t there just a few years ago.\nHowever, the provider introduced a handful of virtual servers to ensure it covers \u201cinconvenient\u201d VPN locations. All of this means you\u2019ll never find yourself searching for a VPN location and not finding it. That\u2019s how you make a ubiquitous, worldwide server network.\nSpeed Tests: NordVPN\u2019s Performance Evaluation\nThe user experience with a VPN mostly depends on its performance. Our in-depth NordVPN review contains several speed test results we want to share with you, as we think they\u2019re some of the most brilliant.\nBefore we move on, let us show you our native internet speed in Southeastern Europe (Belgrade):\nOur team tested NordVPN across multiple locations \u2014 near and distant. We also repeated these tests 3 times a day, for 3 days in a row. For convenience, we tested 3 popular locations in Europe (the UK), the US, and Asia (Japan) \u2014 the results are below:\nUK Speed Test Results:\nUS Speed Test Results:\nJapan Speed Test Results:\nAll tests were done using the \u201cAuto\u201d option for protocol selection. We don\u2019t need to analyze the speed test results that much. NordVPN is faster than other providers we tested, displaying an imposing level of performance and low latency across all three locations.\n| UK Server | US Server | Japan Server | |\n| \ud83d\udd3d Download Speed Loss | 5.35% | 14.5% | 34.8% |\n| \ud83d\udd3c Upload Speed Loss | 5% | 6.8% | 9.1% |\nFor convenience, we added a small table that displays NordVPN\u2019s speed losses for each server location in percentages. You can notice just how little the provider loses, even on very distant servers.\nTake Japan as an example \u2014 it\u2019s more than 13,000 kilometers (8,000+ miles) away from our location!\nStreaming & Torrenting With NordVPN\nNordVPN exemplifies a provider whose streaming and torrenting abilities should be top-tier. During our 10-plus-year use, we rarely had any problems in this regard. To ensure this is the case, our team\u2019s NordVPN review meant that we would test it once again for you.\nAs expected, the results were amazing. We managed to access at least 30 Netflix libraries, such as those from the US, the UK, Canada, Japan, and many European catalogs. Platforms like BBC iPlayer and Hotstar also work flawlessly and without buffering.\nStream Content Freely With NordVPN\nThis applies to obfuscated servers too, whose VPN connection masking provides total anonymity necessary to get over certain geo-blocks. We must say it\u2019s superior to CyberGhost and its dedicated streaming servers that can \u201cglitch\u201d and not work occasionally.\nNordVPN sings the same catchy tune in P2P situations. Torrenting is extremely easy. Connect to a P2P server, open your Torrent client, and you\u2019re set. The provider is fast, reliable, and easily configurable so that torrenting is uninterrupted.\nWe need to mention that NordVPN can be bound directly to torrent clients with a SOCKS5 proxy, as explained in this guide. So overall, it\u2019s capable of delivering entertainment to your doorstep with a click of a mouse.\nIf your idea of entertainment is exploring the dark web, you can use its Onion Over VPN servers too. However, even \u201cnormal\u201d servers will work for all your activities.\nUsing NordVPN for Bypassing Censorship\nPeople are quickly deterred from visiting the Great Wall or the Bund because of the Great Firewall. The latter isn\u2019t a popular Chinese monument but rather an annoyance that blocks websites and imposes censorship on the country\u2019s online space.\nPeople use VPNs in this country but to no avail, as most don\u2019t work. Thanks to our numerous testers in China, our team discovered that NordVPN works in 2025. Its Obfuscated servers are powerful enough to bypass deep-packet inspection and provide unlimited internet access.\nBetter yet, NordVPN\u2019s speeds in China are stable and fast. Another point for NordVPN is its ability to work in other censored regions. After trying out this provider in the UAE, Turkey, Qatar, Russia, and other countries, we found that it works without a hitch.\nBrowse the Internet Freely With NordVPN\nCustomer Support\nDid you know that NordVPN is the largest VPN company right now? Well, a part of its gargantuan budget is devoted to staggering customer service, which we must praise in this NordVPN review for 2025. What can you expect? 24/7 live chat support, for example!\nIt\u2019s there for you at any moment, showcasing helpfulness and user-friendliness. Email support is another option and might we add, it\u2019s VERY quick to respond. The company is ever-present on YouTube and other social networks for added accessibility.\nIf you\u2019re shy and avoid communication like a proper introvert, don\u2019t panic. FAQs and guides are on the site, explaining everything you\u2019ll want to know. We especially like its setup tutorials for every device under the big yellow ball called Sun.\nYou\u2019ll learn how to install a VPN on your iPhone, router, PlayStation, and so on. With multiple support channels across different platforms, NordVPN will gladly and swiftly solve any problems you might have as a newcomer.\nNordVPN Review: The Final Verdict\nWith this in-depth review of NordVPN coming to an end, we\u2019ll gladly digress on the analysis we performed. This is a great all-around service whose improvements never cease to amaze new and existing users. Recent improvements, in particular, made it much better.\nNordVPN\u2019s status as the most powerful provider is justifiable. It offers top-tier performance, unbeatable privacy and security, excellent compatibility, plenty of server locations, and state-of-the-art streaming/torrenting abilities.\nWhat are its shortcomings?\nTo be 100% honest, there aren\u2019t many. We dislike the lack of website split tunneling, for instance. New users complain about NordVPN\u2019s complexity, which can be the case for first-time users who find the feature-filled apps a tad overwhelming.\nSome users reported occasional connection issues on Windows and macOS. For us, that was rarely the case. Curiosity was also a security breach in 2018 on one server, which the provider patched promptly without consequences, receiving multiple third-party audits shortly after.\nSo, after this comprehensive review of NordVPN, only one question remains.\nShould you buy and use NordVPN? Our team confidently says yes."

  "argos_summary": "The article compares NordVPN and PrivateVPN, concluding that both are safe, log\u2011free services with broad device support, but NordVPN outperforms PrivateVPN in speed, server network, advanced features (double VPN, split tunneling, dark\u2011web monitoring, meshnet), and obfuscation, making it the preferred choice for 2025. PrivateVPN offers a lower price point and decent privacy, yet it lacks many of NordVPN\u2019s advanced tools and has a smaller, non\u2011RAM\u2011based server fleet. NordVPN\u2019s audited no\u2011log policy and superior performance in streaming, torrenting, and censorship\u2011bypass scenarios further strengthen its advantage. Overall, the review recommends NordVPN over PrivateVPN for users seeking comprehensive security, speed, and feature richness, while noting PrivateVPN remains a viable low\u2011cost alternative for basic needs.}",
