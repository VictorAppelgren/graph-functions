Have you got some new stationary that you particularly love? Or is there a lesson you have started doing this year that is already becoming your favourite?\n\nThe start of a new school year is an exciting and sometimes nerve wracking time, so we want to hear all about it.\n\nTell us in the comments what you are loving about being back at school.",
