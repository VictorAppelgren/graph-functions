  "description": "Google's rolling out its redesigned Clock app right now.",
  "content": "We uncovered Google\u2019s Clock app redesign back in May, revealing a visual overhaul in line with the Material 3 Expressive style. Now, it looks like this redesigned app is starting to roll out to users.\n\nVersion 8.1 of the Google Clock app (spotted by Telegram user @mosatoru) includes plenty of Expressive changes. This doesn\u2019t offer all the tweaks we saw in our earlier leak, but you\u2019re still looking at a fairly comprehensive change. You can view our screenshots below.\n\nThe screens reveal a number of notable changes compared to the previous version of the Clock app. This includes a distinct background for your enabled alarms, as well as a new alarm setup screen (see the last image in the gallery). This screen lets you change the alarm name and sound, tweak the applicable days, toggle vibration, toggle the weather forecast, add an Assistant routine, or delete the alarm. I quite like the alarm backgrounds, as they allow you to quickly see which alarms are active and which ones are disabled.\n\nWe also see two distinct buttons for snoozing or stopping an alarm (see the seventh screenshot), as opposed to a slider design in the previous version. This screen also shows the phone wallpaper rather than a blank background. The stopwatch section also gets much larger buttons for stopping, resetting, and completing a lap.\n\nOur earlier Google Clock leak revealed an overhauled timer tab. This redesign didn\u2019t show up in the latest version of the app, but we managed to dig under the hood and enable it nonetheless. You can view the images below.\n\nThe timer creation UI now shows much larger font for hours, minutes, and seconds. It also does away with the built-in number pad for setting the timer. Meanwhile, the second screenshot reveals smaller timers, allowing you to see more at once before you need to scroll.\n\nIn any event, we\u2019re glad to see Google bringing these visual changes to plenty of apps ahead of Android 16\u2019s Material 3 Expressive overhaul later this year.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nMaterial 3 Expressive deep dive: All you need to know about Android's big design upgrade\nMay 13, 2025\nAt The Android Show today, Google officially introduced Material 3 Expressive, the next evolution of Android\u2019s design language, set to arrive with Android 16. This sweeping UI update is a significant step in Google\u2019s ongoing effort to make Android and Wear OS more visually engaging, emotionally resonant, and interactive. With new motion physics, component updates, fresh color schemes, impactful fonts, and more, Material 3 Expressive is poised to reshape how Android feels and functions. Here\u2019s a closer look at what this new design direction means for Android users, what devices will support it, and when you can expect to see it.\nMaterial 3 Expressive: What is it, and why is Google bringing it?\nAndroid 16\u2019s big story is its look. Material 3 Expressive builds on Material Design, Google\u2019s open-source design framework, and is a direct evolution of Material You (Material 3), introduced four years ago with Android 12. To be clear, this is not a new generation like \u201cMaterial 4.\u201d It\u2019s an extension of the Material You design philosophy, not a replacement.\nSo why this update? According to Google, Material 3 Expressive is its most rigorously researched design refresh ever. It stems from 46 global studies, hundreds of design variations, and insights from over 18,000 participants. What emerged from that effort is that \u201cexpressive interfaces\u201d have the power to stir emotions, convey personality, and enhance usability.\nWhat do you think of Google's Material 3 Expressive design for Android?\nGoogle says that in its testing, expressive designs consistently outperformed others on attributes like playfulness, creativity, energy, and friendliness. Usability also saw improvements, with users identifying key UI elements up to four times faster in expressive layouts, making it not just a visual but a functional update.\nMaterial 3 Expressive brings a host of UI upgrades designed to make Android feel livelier and more intuitive. Some of the key themes include:\n- Springier, natural-feeling animations that enhance touch interactions\n- New icon shapes and refreshed typography\n- Background blur effects for depth and focus\n- Updated color themes\n- Home screen and Quick Settings enhancements for a more dynamic layout\n- Visual redesigns for many Google apps, bringing them in line with the new expressive aesthetic\nBefore we break down everything Material 3 Expressive has to offer, let\u2019s talk a bit about its availability.\nWhen will Material 3 Expressive roll out?\nMaterial 3 Expressive will debut on Pixel devices running Android 16. And yes, that includes more than just phones and tablets; the Pixel Watch is also getting a taste of the new design language.\nHowever, don\u2019t expect to see it immediately when Android 16 rolls out publicly. We previously spotted traces of these UI changes hidden in Android 16 Beta 4, the final beta before launch, but they weren\u2019t enabled by default on that update. Now we know why.\nMaterial 3 Expressive will begin rolling out to Pixel phones later this year.\nIn a press briefing, Google confirmed that Material 3 Expressive will begin rolling out to Pixel phones later this year, following the stable Android 16 release in June.\n\u201cSo, the updates for Material Expressive are going to be available on Pixel devices first later this year, but it\u2019s not going to be part of the public release in June,\u201d confirmed Allen Huang, Google\u2019s Director of Product Management for Pixel and Android system UI.\nHowever, the company did say that Material 3 Expressive will be available \u201cat the end of the month,\u201d hinting at a possible beta build that\u2019ll carry some of the new design elements. It\u2019s likely Google was hinting at the first Android 16 QPR1 beta release, but we\u2019ll have to wait and watch.\nThese changes will also appear across Google apps later this year. Other Android OEMs are also expected to adopt elements of Material 3 Expressive, likely blended with their own custom Android skins.\nWhat\u2019s new in Material 3 Expressive?\nLet\u2019s explore the new Material 3 Expressive design changes you can expect to see on your Android phones and apps.\nNew animations and motion physics\nMaterial 3 Expressive brings a new spring-based motion system that promises to make interactions more fluid, dynamic, and natural. For instance, when you dismiss a notification, there\u2019s a smooth detach effect with a haptic rumble, and the surrounding notifications also subtly react to your swipe. You\u2019ll see similar effects when closing an app in the Recents screen, interacting with the volume sliders, or pulling down the notification shade. Developers can tap into these expressive spring physics using updated Material motion APIs to ensure their app transitions also feel consistent with Material 3 Expressive.\nMore dynamic and personalized color themes\nMaterial 3 Expressive also refines Android\u2019s dynamic color theming engine with richer, more nuanced color palettes that aim to improve visual hierarchy and personalization. Google says the updated system ensures clearer separation between primary, secondary, and tertiary tones, helping users better understand which actions matter the most. By building visual contrast, the new themes aim to prevent interface elements from blending together. That said, Material 3 Expressive themes will continue to reflect custom wallpapers and preferences.\nTypography refresh\nTypography is also getting a serious upgrade with Material 3 Expressive, bringing new type styles designed to enhance user attention. Headlines and key actions are now easier to spot thanks to larger sizes, heavier weights, and improved hierarchy. Whether you\u2019re starting a recording or checking unread messages, the new Material 3 Expressive type styles will make those interactions feel more immediate. Google is making these updates available to developers through the Material type scale, so Android apps will soon offer richer layouts with improved clarity. The company says Material 3 Expressive\u2019s typography and aforementioned color theming changes will also apply across Google apps (see video above). You can see an example of this in our leaked preview of the Google Clock\u2019s Material 3 Expressive redesign.\nNew shapes, transitions, and updated components\nMaterial 3 Expressive brings a new shape library to Android with 35 distinctive options that will let app developers create more diverse interfaces. Android users will see smooth shape-morphing transitions, such as a square morphing into a squircle, to provide a more fluid and interactive experience. You can see an example of this in the video embedded above.\nMaterial 3 Expressive also carries an upgraded suite of components, including fifteen new or refreshed UI elements. There will be new additions like button groups, split buttons, toolbars, loading indicators, and a floating action button (FAB). Existing elements like app bars, carousels, icon buttons, and navigation bars have also been refined with improved customization for shapes, sizes, and styles. We also previously showed you examples of new status bar icons for Wi-Fi, mobile data, airplane mode, and battery level.\nEnhanced system UI: Quick Settings, notification shade backgrounds, and more\nThe Android system UI is becoming more customizable with Material 3 Expressive, and the biggest example can be seen in Quick Settings. Users will now be able to pin more controls, like Flashlight or Do Not Disturb, for faster access. Quick Settings tiles are also becoming resizable, allowing users to pack more features into that space than ever before.\nMeanwhile, the notification shade backgrounds now feature a subtle blur effect that adds depth, allowing you to stay in context while navigating your phone.\nA new feature called Live Updates, which you\u2019ve probably already seen in previews, makes it easier to track real-time progress from apps like Uber Eats or Google Maps. It puts delivery times or rideshare statuses front and center without needing to open an app. All of these can be expected to make for a more intuitive system experience.\nMaterial 3 Expressive on Pixel Watch and Wear OS\nMaterial 3 Expressive is also making its way to Wear OS, beginning with the Pixel Watch. While Google has confirmed that colors still won\u2019t sync between phones and wearables, Material 3 Expressive\u2019s dynamic color theming is also coming to Wear OS, with its effects reflected consistently across the system UI.\nAnimations are now designed to follow the natural curve of the Pixel Watch\u2019s circular display, creating a more immersive and fluid experience. Users can expect the same springy transitions and motion effects found on Android phones, helping unify the overall experience of the ecosystem.\nThe update also introduces shape-morphing elements that adapt elegantly to the watch\u2019s compact form. Daily interactions, like entering a PIN or controlling media, are becoming smoother and more responsive. Glanceable buttons now stretch edge-to-edge for easier tapping, and refreshed Tiles offer quicker access to essential features like workouts or favorite contacts. Google also promises real performance improvements, including up to 10% better battery life with the Wear OS 6 update.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nUpcoming Google Clock redesign shows off Material 3 Expressive at its best\nMay 6, 2025\n- Google is updating its Clock with some of the boldest Material 3 Expressive changes we\u2019ve seen so far.\n- The updated app plays with fonts, as well as new UI elements.\n- An alarm can now be dismissed using a button instead of the old slider.\nAs we wait for the announcement of Google\u2019s new Material 3 Expressive system at Google I/O, I\u2019m seeing more and more leaks of the new look. So far we\u2019ve seen the new settings app, the Google account section as well as the new keyboard. None of them seemed very expressive, though.\nToday, we have another look at more materials from the upcoming design system. Thanks to a source inside Google, I was able to try out the refreshed Google Clock app, which showcases some more significant Material 3 Expressive changes.\nYou\u2019re reading an Authority Insights story. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\nThe most redesigned part of the app is the alarms tab. Google removed the expanding tabs and instead added a panel sliding from the bottom when editing or adding new alarms. The panel itself also looks interesting \u2014 the use of a very tall font, a fun new switch for AM/PM, and a very compressed options layout makes it stand out.\nEnabled alarms are also now highlighted in a way more visible way, which should make it easier to see if they are active at a quick glance.\nGoogle also got rid of the old swipe-to-dismiss gesture when an alarm goes off, instead opting for simple buttons. It\u2019s honestly surprising that the old design lived for so long. The blank background has also been replaced with the phone\u2019s wallpaper.\nThe timers tab also sees a major redesign. Adding new timers is now done through a panel similar to the alarms. The timer cards are also much smaller, which should make it easier for people who like to use a bunch at once.\nLastly, the stopwatch function has also been updated with much larger buttons, which should make it easier to use. There\u2019s a new font here, too.\nI\u2019ve been using the new Clock for a few days, and the changes are positive. They generally improve the app\u2019s experience, and I hope Google makes similar changes throughout the system.\nMaterial 3 Expressive is likely to debut at Google I/O later this month.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nHere\u2019s when Android 16's Material 3 Expressive redesign and Desktop Mode will roll out\nJune 10, 2025\n- The Android 16 update is now available for Pixel devices, but the anticipated Material 3 Expressive UI and new Desktop Mode are not included in this initial release.\n- Google plans to launch the Material 3 Expressive redesign with the Android 16 QPR1 update, which is expected to roll out on September 3, 2025.\n- The new Desktop Mode is also slated for the Android 16 QPR1 release and is currently available for testing in QPR1 Beta 2.\nGoogle is finally rolling out the Android 16 update to supported Pixel devices today. The update introduces some nice quality-of-life improvements to notifications, welcome accessibility features, and a new security mode. However, it doesn\u2019t bring two of the biggest changes that Google announced last month: the new UI based on Material 3 Expressive and the new Desktop Mode experience. Fortunately, both of these features are launching very soon, and you can even try them out right now.\nWhen is Google rolling out Android 16\u2019s Material 3 Expressive redesign?\nMaterial 3 Expressive, the latest iteration of Google\u2019s design language, promises a bolder, more fluid, and more engaging UI. It introduces a revamped Quick Settings panel, new physics-based animations, fresh dynamic color schemes, background blur effects, more customization options, updated buttons, and refreshed icons, among other changes.\nAndroid\u2019s big Material 3 Expressive redesign is set to go live in the upcoming Android 16 QPR1 release. According to a source, Google plans to roll out the update to supported Pixel devices on September 3, 2025. The update\u2019s source code will be released a few weeks earlier, on August 20, 2025.\nThese release dates aren\u2019t set in stone, as Google can change things at the last minute to address major issues that arise or in response to other news. For example, the company originally planned to release Android 16 on June 3, 2025, but it decided to delay the release to today for unknown reasons.\nWhile we can\u2019t say for sure that Android\u2019s Material 3 Expressive redesign will roll out on September 3, 2025, we do know that it will go live in Android 16 QPR1. Google explicitly said that \u201cmuch of the new visual polish associated with Material [3] Expressive\u201d will arrive in the \u201cQ3 update in-between the API releases.\u201d\nThe \u201cQ3 update\u201d Google mentioned refers to its third quarterly Android release of 2025. Internally, this is called \u201c25Q3,\u201d which corresponds to the public Android 16 QPR1 release. For context, today\u2019s Android 16 launch is considered \u201c25Q2,\u201d the second quarterly release of the year.\nThus, the Material 3 Expressive UI overhaul is confirmed to go live in Android\u2019s third quarterly release of 2025, which typically rolls out in the first week of September. If you would rather not wait until then, you can try the new design right now on your Pixel device by installing the Android 16 QPR1 beta. Much of the new UI is already available in the Beta 1 release, but more changes are coming in the next Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2 update, which will also bring the long-awaited Desktop Mode.\nWhen is Google rolling out Android 16\u2019s new Desktop Mode experience?\nPower users have been begging Google to add a proper desktop mode like Samsung DeX for years, and the company is finally delivering. In collaboration with Samsung, Google is developing this new experience for Android 16 QPR1. The feature brings a desktop-like interface to connected displays, complete with a taskbar, status bar, freeform window support, and mouse movement between screens.\nWhen we first showed off Android\u2019s new desktop mode experience last month, we didn\u2019t know when it would go live. Today, however, Google announced that the feature is now available to try on your Pixel phone. The company said that \u201cconnected displays support on compatible Android devices is now in developer preview with the Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2 release.\u201d\nSince the Desktop Mode feature is in developer preview, it isn\u2019t enabled by default. To enable it, you need to go to Settings > System > Developer options and toggle \u201cenable desktop experience features.\u201d\nAlongside connected display support, Android 16 QPR1 also brings enhanced desktop windowing capabilities. Google is introducing flexible window tiling, multiple desktop sessions, enhanced app compatibility, multi-instance management, and desktop persistence. These features are available for testing in the new Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2 release and will be included in the stable update rolling out in September.\nGoogle hasn\u2019t said when it\u2019ll enable Android\u2019s new connected display support and enhanced desktop windowing capabilities by default. It\u2019s likely the features will remain locked behind a developer option even in the stable release of Android 16 QPR1, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\nWhen these features do launch, the connected display support will only be available on devices that support a DisplayPort connection. Among Pixel devices, this means the Pixel 8 and later, including the A-series. Although the Pixel Tablet doesn\u2019t support a DisplayPort connection, its display is large enough to run a desktop session, so it can at least use desktop mode on the internal display.\nThank you for being part of our community.
