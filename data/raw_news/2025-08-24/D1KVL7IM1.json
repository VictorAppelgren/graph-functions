The company was founded in 2020 by the creators of Uber\u2019s AI pricing platform Michelangelo.\n\nGhodsi said Tecton\u2019s technology and talent could help build out Databricks\u2019 Agent Bricks, its flagship product for building and automating workflows with AI agents, as competition to supply AI tools to businesses heats up.\n\nWith this deal, the report said, Databricks can help reduce response times in AI applications, a key priority for customers developing interactive services.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the real-time building block to feed real-time information into the agents,\u201d he said, adding that speed is crucial for AI use cases such as voice interaction. \u201cMany of the use cases are directly user-facing and human-facing, and humans hate to wait.\u201d\n\nThe companies were already tied together, both by working together and through Databricks investing in Tecton. Ghodsi added that many of Tecton\u2019s clients, including crypto exchange Coinbase, already use Databricks\u2019 services, meaning the acquisition would help to bolster relationships with clients that depend on both technologies.\n\nThe deal follows a report last week that Databricks was finalizing a funding round that would help it reach a valuation of $100 billion. The money will be used to help the company attract AI talent, and postpone its plans to go public, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\u201cThe finance team tells me to not use this term, but I think Databricks has a shot to be a trillion-dollar company,\u201d Ghodsi told the newspaper. \u201cBut we have a lot of work ahead of us to get there.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, PYMNTS wrote recently about findings from the PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cThe Agentic Trust Gap: Enterprise CFOs Push Pause on Agentic AI.\u201d\n\nThe report spotlights that while familiarity with agentic AI is nearly universal among CFOs there is hesitation regarding its deployment. Just 15% of executives surveyed said they were even considering putting agentic AI to work, with most still in the early evaluation phase.\n\n\u201cThis contrasts with the surging adoption of generative AI, which CFOs are increasingly using for tasks like content creation, customer service, coding and data analysis,\u201d PYMNTS wrote. \u201cThe report shows generative AI\u2019s deployment for product and service innovation up 21% and for spotting fraud and errors up 31% since March 2024.\u201d",

Venture capital firm Thrive Capital is expected to co-lead the round, with Andreessen Horowitz also planning to invest.\nDatabricks, which provides software that helps businesses analyze datasets, has grown as the artificial intelligence industry has blossomed, the report said. The company was valued at $62 billion following another funding round earlier this year.\nThe company will use its new capital to compete in the race to attract AI talent, CEO Ali Ghodsi said, per the report. Databricks wasn\u2019t planning another funding effort so soon, but prospective investors have been in touch daily.\nThe funding round will also help Databricks postpone plans to go public, the report said.\n\u201cThe finance team tells me to not use this term, but I think Databricks has a shot to be a trillion-dollar company,\u201d Ghodsi said, per the report. \u201cBut we have a lot of work ahead of us to get there.\u201d\nDatabricks said in June that it projects that its data warehousing business will nearly double in size this year. A company spokesperson said Databricks expects a $1 billion revenue run rate for Databricks SQL by the close of its fiscal year in January 2026, compared to a $600 million run rate in December 2024.\nAlso in June, PYMNTS wrote about the challenges facing companies such as Databricks and Snowflake. When these firms rose to prominence, their success was bolstered by the growth of digital-first businesses, startups or cloud-native unicorns, which required scalable, agile infrastructure to drive their growth.\n\u201cCloud data warehouses and platforms were the answer, offering a way to store, manage and analyze data without the burdens of traditional IT infrastructure,\u201d a June 11 report said. \u201cHowever, as these cloud providers set their sights on the next phase of growth by targeting large, multinational enterprises with legacy systems, a different picture is emerging, one centered around capital budgets for mainframe modernization, enterprise resource planning (ERP) upgrade timelines and multiyear IT strategic plans.\u201d\nFinancial filings and statements from the top cloud providers about their deal plans show that digital transformation in the enterprise space is a marathon, not a sprint."

      "text": "It started with moving from legal pads to spreadsheets. Then shifted from spreadsheets to accounting and payments automation. Next, gen AI came along and the trend from manual finance management and forecasting took on a new speed and urgency. Now a new, more sophisticated and complicated form of AI is here, one that requires CFOs to let go of the wheel in a big way.\nIt\u2019s agentic AI. It promises to turn yesterday\u2019s month-end close into a continuous, autonomous, automated predictive engine. On the consumer side, agents are being pitched as a shopping assistant and task manager. But the more impactful usage will come from the business side of the economy. With capital markets bracing for tighter spreads and relentless rate volatility, the pressure to capture AI\u2019s agentic speed advantage is suddenly urgent. CFOs know that, but \u2026\nThe same executives who champion agentic AI\u2019s autonomy are privately questioning whether the technology is battle-ready. PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s coverage\u2014including last week\u2019s (June 21) interview with Trustly chief legal officer Kathryn McCall\u2014underscores a growing fear that agentic AI can go \u201coff script,\u201d exposing firms to cascading payment errors, sanctions screening failures and headline-grabbing compliance fines. Infrastructure gaps, large language model transparency and still unsettled audit and regulatory standards mean accountability remains a moving target. For finance leaders, the message is stark: Harness AI\u2019s momentum now, but build the guardrails before the next quarterly call\u2014or risk owning the fallout.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that enterprise CFOs aren\u2019t ignoring agentic AI, but neither are they racing to deploy it. Familiarity with the technology is nearly universal, as expected from the hype. But the execution-level confidence isn\u2019t there yet. Just 15% of executives surveyed by PYMNTS Intelligence are considering putting it to work, and most of those remain in the early evaluation stage. The hesitation comes even as the use of gen AI has surged. Among its use cases: creating content, fielding customer service queries, coding software and analyzing data. Since March 2024, the share of CFOs deploying the technology to innovate products and services has jumped 21%. Meanwhile, its use for spotting fraud and errors has climbed 31% over that same period.\nHere\u2019s another interesting finding: CFOs are more likely to trust agentic if they\u2019ve been successful with gen AI. The momentum behind agentic AI, which goes one step further than its precursor by autonomously making decisions and carrying out tasks independently of humans, builds at companies where the latter has lived up to its promise. Among highly automated firms, 67% are weighing agentic AI adoption, compared to just 11% of their low-automation peers.\nLikewise, firms reporting strong return on investment (ROI) from gen AI are twice as likely to increase their spending compared to low-automation CFOs. Among the big questions: Will the technology take away jobs? Across the board, CFOs say that gen AI has reshaped staffing needs. All report needing more analytically skilled workers, and nearly all agree that the overall skill mix across teams has changed. AI is on its way to presenting another level of automation to CFOs, one that will require a prerequisite course in gen AI deployment to understand and a more cautious, patient approach.\nThese are just some of the findings detailed in \u201cThe CAIO Report: The Agentic Trust Gap: Enterprise CFOs Push Pause on Agentic AI,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence and AI-ID collaboration. This edition examines the future of autonomous AI in enterprise settings and draws on insights from a survey of 60 CFOs conducted in May 2025.\nAgentic AI Adoption Lags Despite High Familiarity\nCFOs know the term, but not the tech.\nTechnology companies developing and selling agentic AI tools have done a strong job of making sure companies know what\u2019s on offer. Every CFO now knows about the technology and its potential to fully automate a host of labor-intensive business functions, from cybersecurity to product development. The reality is that very few companies are actually using it.\nDespite nearly universal familiarity, just 15% of CFOs are even considering putting agentic AI to work in their companies\u2014and 85% say they have no current plans. Among those considering climbing on board, 89% remain in the evaluation phase, with no concrete roadmap in place.\nBut that top-line number obscures a more nuanced story. Adoption interest closely tracks how far firms have already gone with gen AI automation. More than two in three CFOs from high-automation enterprises are considering agentic AI. That figure plunges to 11% among firms still dependent on manual workflows. Firms that already automate processes more are more willing to explore what comes next.\nThe same split appears by self-reported impact. One-quarter of high-impact CFOs\u2014those whose companies are most active in using gen AI\u2014are at least considering the agentic version. In medium- and low-impact roles, the share drops to 12% and 7%, respectively. The gap reflects how closely interest in autonomous systems aligns with C-suite support.\nEven among executives considering adoption, active test runs of the technology remain rare. Just 6% of high-impact CFOs, meaning executives at highly automated firms, say they\u2019re exploring adoption within the next year.\nGen AI Use Cases Surge While Investment Cools\nAgentic AI remains an idea, not a project.\nWhat is clear is that companies are not accelerating their use of agentic tools. Among CFOs considering adopting the technology, 89% say their organizations are still evaluating its relevance and fit. Just 11% are running pilots or proof-of-concept trials. Another 11% report active vendor partnerships. The overlap means that very few are doing more than research and actively using the technology.\nEven among the most engaged segment\u2014high-impact CFOs\u2014activity remains limited. One in five say their firms are piloting agentic AI. The same share reports working with vendors to explore early use cases. That leaves four in five still in the planning phase. These CFOs are best positioned to move forward\u2014but most have yet to do so.\nEngagement is nonexistent among lower-impact personas. No medium- or low-impact CFOs say their firms are evaluating agentic AI. None are testing deployments. None are working with partners. This total lack of movement reinforces the idea that strategic influence is a precondition for even limited adoption steps.\nCaution among more uncertain firms may reflect broader pressures. Gen AI has become essential\u201490% of CFOs say it\u2019s now critical for financial planning. Use is expanding across fraud detection, service innovation and real-time query response. Still, investment in the technology is slowing. Just 27% of firms are increasing budgets this year\u2014down from 53% last year. That contraction likely spills over to agentic AI, which requires even greater confidence and trust in the technology.\nUntil firms commit time, budgets and cross-functional leadership, agentic AI could sit stuck where it is today: as a widely known tool with promise for transforming business operations, but no timeline for that to happen.\nAutomation and ROI Drive Future Adoption Plans\nOver the past year, CFOs have doubled the importance they place on Gen AI.\nWhile companies have been slow to deploy agentic AI, their use of gen AI has nearly doubled. Nine in 10 CFOs now say it\u2019s very or extremely important to financial planning and analysis\u2014up from just 47% in March 2024. That shift reflects not just broader use but growing operational dependence on the technology. Gen AI has become core to how CFOs plan, monitor and execute across financial domains.\nUsage continues to expand. Since March 2024, gen AI\u2019s use for product and service innovation has grown 21%. Deployment for spotting fraud and operational errors is up 31%. Three out of four CFOs now say they use the technology to generate real-time, automated responses to customer queries.\nIt all demonstrates that gen AI is no longer siloed to a narrow, individual task: CFOs say the technology\u2019s value reaches across core functions. The tool ranks as highly important for financial reporting (87%), cost management (85%) and capital management (88%). More than 70% say it\u2019s critical for strategic planning, risk management and working capital optimization. The shift isn\u2019t limited to back-end efficiency\u2014it spans decision making, compliance and customer experience.\nStill, enthusiasm is now tempered by caution. Just 27% of firms are increasing their gen AI budgets in 2025\u2014down from 53% a year ago. Investment plans now track closely with results. Among firms reporting strong ROI, half are increasing spend. Among firms with negligible ROI, that number drops to 17%.\nAutomation levels matter, too. Highly automated firms are three times more likely to consider agentic AI adoption than low-automation peers. These firms have already laid the groundwork\u2014and now view agentic AI as a logical next step. Firms that have scaled gen AI\u2014and benefited\u2014are the ones continuing to invest.\nGen AI Shifts Workforce Needs and Skill Priorities\nCFOs agree they need more analytically skilled workers in their businesses.\nGen AI has started reshaping the talent CFOs need to transform how they operate. All CFOs now say implementation of the technology has increased their need for more analytically skilled workers. In March 2024, that share stood closer to 60%. The shift in the past year reflects growing hands-on use and a rising urgency to close capability gaps.\nThe impact goes beyond analytics alone. Ninety-seven percent of CFOs say the overall mix of skills required across the business has changed. As gen AI automates workflows and elevates data as a core asset, all with the involvement of humans, CFOs increasingly need talent that can evaluate, interpret and act on machine-generated output.\nTech teams are expanding in response. Eighty-three percent of CFOs now say they need a larger technology or IT support team. That\u2019s up 25 percentage points from 58% in March 2024. Demand for high-skill tech roles has grown as gen AI tools become more embedded in daily operations.\nAt the same time, demand for lower-skilled labor is falling. More than six in 10 CFOs say their need for such workers has declined. Nearly half (45%) say they no longer need to hire as many employees as possible in certain businesses. The trend points to gen AI\u2019s role in reducing headcount pressure while reallocating hiring needs to higher-value, higher-skilled roles.\nThe workforce shift is structural. Skills once considered specialized\u2014like data fluency and systems thinking\u2014are fast becoming baseline requirements. gen AI isn\u2019t just changing the tools teams use. It\u2019s changing who organizations need to hire, train and retain to stay competitive.\nRead More\nPYMNTS Intelligence is the leading provider of information on the trends driving AI adoption patterns. To stay up to date, subscribe to our newsletters and read our in-depth reports.\nMethodology\n\u201cThe Agentic Trust Gap: Enterprise CFOs Push Pause on Agentic AI\u201d is based on a survey of 60 enterprise CFOs conducted between May 6, 2025, and May 16, 2025. The report examines how CFOs are evaluating and adopting agentic AI as a follow-on to their existing gen AI investments. Respondents represent U.S.-based companies with $250 million or more in annual revenue across a range of industries. The sample included CFOs with varying degrees of strategic influence and operational impact, enabling analysis by automation maturity, gen AI return on investment (ROI) and role-based authority. PYMNTS Intelligence designed the survey instrument to measure both adoption intent and current deployment patterns, with an additional focus on budget planning, staffing and enterprise capability gaps."

Only 15% of executives surveyed are even considering putting agentic AI to work, with most remaining in the early evaluation stage.\nThis contrasts with the surging adoption of generative AI, which CFOs are increasingly using for tasks like content creation, customer service, coding and data analysis. The report shows generative AI\u2019s deployment for product and service innovation up 21% and for spotting fraud and errors up 31% since March 2024.\nThe report underscores that the willingness to embrace agentic AI, which goes a step further than its predecessor by autonomously making decisions and carrying out tasks independently, is not uniform. Instead, it is influenced by a firm\u2019s existing levels of automation and the tangible return on investment (ROI) already realized from generative AI.\nThis suggests that confidence in more advanced AI systems is built upon a foundation of successful prior AI implementation and a proven track record of automation within the enterprise.\nHere are specific data points detailing how automation and ROI are shaping future adoption plans:\n- Automation as a Prerequisite: Among highly automated firms, 67% of CFOs are weighing agentic AI adoption, a contrast to just 11% of their low-automation peers. Highly automated firms, having already laid the groundwork, are three times more likely to consider agentic AI as a logical next step.\n- ROI Drives Further Investment: Companies that report strong ROI from their generative AI initiatives are twice as likely to increase their spending on AI compared to low-automation CFOs. Among firms with strong ROI, half are increasing their AI budgets, whereas only 17% of firms with negligible ROI plan to do so.\n- Growing Reliance on Generative AI: CFOs\u2019 perception of generative AI\u2019s importance for financial planning and analysis has nearly doubled, with 9 in 10 now deeming it \u201cvery or extremely important,\u201d up from 47% in March 2024. This indicates a growing operational dependence on generative AI across core financial functions like reporting, cost management and strategic planning.\nDespite the benefits of generative AI and its growing importance, CFOs remain cautious about agentic AI due to fears it could go off script, leading to cascading payment errors, sanctions screening failures and compliance fines. Challenges like infrastructure gaps, the transparency of large language models, and unsettled audit and regulatory standards further contribute to this hesitation.\nThe report also reveals that generative AI is reshaping workforce needs, increasing the demand for analytically skilled workers and altering the overall skill mix across teams, while reducing the need for lower-skilled labor.\nAdditionally, while generative AI use cases surge, overall investment in the technology is cooling, with only 27% of firms increasing budgets this year, down from 53% last year, a trend that likely impacts agentic AI adoption.\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."

The move follows a funding round that could value the company at $100\u202fbillion and postpone an IPO. Meanwhile, a PYMNTS Intelligence report shows CFOs are familiar with agentic AI but only 15% are considering deployment, with most still in evaluation, contrasting with rapid growth in generative\u2011AI use for content, customer service, and fraud detection.",
