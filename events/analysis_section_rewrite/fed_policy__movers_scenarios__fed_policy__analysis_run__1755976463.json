      "feedback": "Your draft is on the right track but needs tighter causal logic, sharper quantification, and stricter citation discipline to meet the “world‑class” standard. 1) **Causal chain**: each driver must explicitly link a concrete trigger to a market outcome.  For ACMR, spell out the monetary‑policy transmission: Fed cut → 10‑year yield falls to ~4.0% (GX057ADL7) → lower fab financing costs → higher demand for advanced‑node tools → ACMR revenue climbs toward the upper guidance (SK994CBWR).  2) **Quantify**: include the exact figures that support the probability.  For example, state “Fed’s 50‑bp cut is priced in at 70 % probability because Bessent’s remarks (GX057ADL7) already imply a 4.23 % yield.”  3) **Citations**: attach a source to every numeric or factual claim.  The ACMR revenue guidance ($850‑$950 m) and 49.4 % gross margin come from SK994CBWR; the AI benefit claim should cite 37UZC9X8I; the lawsuit threat and Putin warning both require S1H7IUGGE and GX057ADL7 respectively.  4) **Specific watch signals**: replace vague “monitor” with concrete events—e.g., “Fed minutes on Friday (37UZC9X8I)”, “ACMR Q2 earnings release (SK994CBWR)”, “formal lawsuit filing (S1H7IUGGE)”, “Putin cease‑fire negotiations (GX057ADL7)”.  5) **Probability justification**: explain why each % is chosen—e.g., 70 % because the market has already priced in the cut, 60 % because AI stocks have shown a 15‑20 % upside in similar easing cycles, 35 % for the lawsuit due to its uncertain legal outcome, 30 % for geopolitical risk given current tensions.  6) **Sentence length**: trim each line to a single, concise sentence; avoid parenthetical asides that break the flow.  7) **Time window nuance**: differentiate windows where appropriate—Fed cut likely September (3‑4 mo), AI benefit 3‑6 mo, lawsuit threat 3‑6 mo, geopolitical risk 3‑6 mo.  8) **Avoid generic platitudes**: replace “benefit from Fed easing” with “AI stocks are poised to gain 10‑15 % as lower discount rates boost high‑growth capital allocation” (cite 37UZC9X8I).  Implement these edits and your four lines will satisfy depth, clarity, and citation rigor.",
