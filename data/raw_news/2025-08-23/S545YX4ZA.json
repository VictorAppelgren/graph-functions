  "description": "The HBO host credits Trump\u2019s focus on tips, toilets and airport security for picking off Democratic voters.",
  "content": "HBO host Bill Maher urged the Democratic Party on Friday to see how President Donald Trump has become a \u201cmaster\u201d at picking off their voters.\n\nDuring the latest episode of \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher,\u201d the comedian admitted that while Trump doesn\u2019t run on protecting democracy or other high-minded American ideals, he knows how to sell obvious things to the common man, which is why he continues to take chunks of voters away from his opposition.\n\n\u201cHe is the master at winning votes from small groups who are passionate about one issue, picking up a couple percent here, a couple there until it\u2019s \u2018YMCA!'\u201d he said, quoting the president\u2019s favorite campaign song.\n\nMaher provided an example showcasing Trump\u2019s skill. \u201cWhile Democrats offer up high-minded intangibles like equity and saving the soul of America, Trump says, \u2018Hey waitress, how would you like to pay no tax on those tips?\u2019 Remember that? And everybody was like, \u2018Why didn\u2019t we think of that?'\u201d\n\nHe offered that as a reason Trump won Nevada in 2024 \u2013 the first time a GOP candidate has done so in 20 years \u2013 because of all the service industry jobs there that run on tips.\n\nMaher then listed the other groups Trump was able to snag votes from that led to his victory.\n\n\u201cHe did it with the tips. He got the TikTok vote. He got the people for whom toilets are very important vote. He got the \u2018enough of taking our shoes off at the airport\u2019 vote, the crypto bro vote, the tech bro vote, the bro bro vote,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cHe got rappers and kale eaters.\u201d\n\nHe also mentioned how Trump was able to secure the former independent candidate and current Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s supporters in 2024, saying, \u201cOh, that\u2019s another \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 four percent he picked off. And they\u2019re ride or die.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump runs for office like that kid in eighth grade who ran for school president on a pledge of more snow days,\u201d Maher joked.\n\nHe continued, saying that \u201celections are won on the margins, by a coalition of little things that hit people personally. Trump gets this, he feels your pain in the a\u2013. Kamala ran on democracy, which is the most important issue. But without the political skill to sell it, it added up to nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Trump was running on, \u2018I\u2019ll make the poop go down.\u2019 He never shut up about bad shower pressure, s\u2014\u2013 light bulbs, and low-flow toilets. Not exactly \u2018ask not what your country can do for you,\u2019 but for some little niche group, it was all that mattered,\u201d he said.\n\nRegarding Trump\u2019s efforts to potentially reclassify marijuana, Maher joked, \u201cFinally, he got around to me.\u201d",

      "text": "Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell told the Department of Justice earlier in 2025 that she never saw President Donald Trump act inappropriately, according to DOJ documents released Friday of her interview.\n\"I think they were friendly, like people are in social settings. I don't \u2014 I don't think they were close friends, or I certainly never witnessed the President in any of \u2014 I don't recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance.\" she told the DOJ.\n\"I actually never saw the President in any type of massage setting. I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.\"\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche interviewed Epstein associate Maxwell at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee, Florida, in July, where she has been serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.\nEPSTEIN\u2019S FORMER LAWYER: GHISLAINE MAXWELL SHOULD GET IMMUNITY IN EXCHANGE FOR SECRETS\nThe interview was held across a two-day period, with the administration weighing in August whether to release the audio file and transcript of the interview, senior administration officials previously told Fox Digital.\nMaxwell explained in her interviews that she first met Trump in the 1990s through her father, saying Trump was \"always very cordial and very kind to me.\"\n\"Well, I just want to say for my relationship with President Trump \u2014 relationship's a big word \u2014 but I just want to say that I met him or I believe I may have, because of my father, in the '90s,\" she said.\n\"Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me,\" she continued. \"And I just want to say that I find \u2026 I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now. And I like him, and I've always liked him. So, that is the sum and substance of my entire relationship with him.\"\nAs for Epstein's relationship with Trump, Maxwell said she only ever witnessed the pair interacting in social settings and that she was unsure how they struck up a friendly association.\n\"I don't know how they met, and I don't know how they became friends,\" she told Blanche. \"I certainly saw them together, and I remember the few times I observed them together, but they were friendly. I mean, they seemed friendly.\n\"I believe I only ever saw them in social settings,\" she continued. \"I don't recall any private settings.\"\nEpstein was a notorious predator who pleaded guilty to procuring underage girls for prostitution in 2008, before he was arrested in 2019 on new federal charges of sex trafficking minors and conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of minors. The predatory billionaire, who had rubbed elbows with the world's elites stretching from Bill Gates to being photographed with Trump long before his presidency, was found dead in his New York City jail cell in August 2019 by an apparent suicide.\nMaxwell continued in her DOJ interviews that she last saw Trump in the mid-2000s in a social setting. When pressed if Maxwell had ever heard rumors or witnessed Trump do anything inappropriate with \"masseuses or with anybody in your world,\" she gave a firm denial.\n\"Absolutely never, in any context,\" she responded.\nToward the end of her interview, Maxwell asked Blanche to add to the record that she believes Trump was \"swept into\" the controversy surrounding Epstein.\n\"I just would like to put out there that I also focused on how I think the president got swept into some of this unnecessarily, by the way,\" she said. \"And I'm not a conspiracy theorist, and I certainly don't subscribe to all the \u2014 all of everything that I see. But I do believe that there is animus in some areas that may have contributed to how the use of the president to harm him, that I find deeply offensive.\n\"And whilst I can't obviously say definitively that that is what it is, I would like to show you what I see so that you can evaluate it and do with that as you see fit if it needs to be addressed. I've seen it, it struck me and I would like to give it to you,\" she continued, before Blanche agreed to her request and the interview wrapped for the day.\nMaxwell weighed in on Epstein\u2019s 50th birthday \"book,\" which included people sending him cards in 2003, but said she did not recall Trump sending Epstein a card and reported she had no evidence of such a card in her discovery of legal proceedings.\nThe DOJ and FBI said in a joint memo in July that the two agencies had no further information to share with the public about Epstein's case and death, determining that he died by suicide and that there was no list of clients whom Epstein may have procured for exploitation by third parties.\nThe memo set off condemnation from some MAGA supporters, who said the reports would not make the Epstein scandal disappear and continued calling for documents to be released. Such supporters claim that Epstein did not hang himself and that the death was allegedly part of a bigger cover-up protecting elites allegedly involved in his sexual abuse of minors.\nTrump repeatedly has slammed the Epstein case as a hoax promoted by the Democrats, including chastising reporters who asked him about the matter when the FBI and DOJ first reported evidence showing Epstein committed suicide.\n\"For years, it's Epstein, over and over again,\" Trump said in a July Truth Social post. \"Why are we giving publicity to Files written by Obama, Crooked Hillary, Comey, Brennan, and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden administration.\n\"They created the Epstein Files, just like they created the FAKE Hillary Clinton/Christopher Steele Dossier that they used on me, and now my so-called \u2018friends\u2019 are playing right into their hands,\" Trump wrote. \"Why didn\u2019t these Radical Left Lunatics release the Epstein Files? If there was ANYTHING in there that could have hurt the MAGA Movement, why didn\u2019t they use it?\"\nAmid mounting calls from voters that the government release more details on Epstein, Trump instructed the Justice Department in July to release \"all credible\" evidence in the files.\n\"We\u2019d like to release everything, but we don\u2019t want people to get hurt that shouldn\u2019t be hurt, and I would assume that was why he was there,\" he told Newsmax in July.\nThe White House referred Fox News Digital to Trump's public comments earlier Friday when asked about the Maxwell interview drop.\n\"Innocent people shouldn't be burt, but I'm in support of keeping it totally open,\" Trump told the media Friday of keeping the Epstein case open. \"I couldn't care less. You got a lot of people that it could be mentioned in those files that don't deserve to be, people, because he knew everybody in Palm Beach.\n\"This is a Democratic hoax to try and get the significance of what we've done over the past seven months,\" he added. \"Nobody's ever seen anything like it. They say it's No. 1 in history. What we've done, including stopping seven wars, I mean.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News Digital\u2019s Brooke Singman, Breanne Deppisch and Ashley Oliver contributed to this report."

Roger Marshall, R-Kan., said.\nHouse Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., is leading the investigation into the alleged cover-up of Biden's cognitive decline and use of the autopen during his tenure as president.\nComer said on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle\" last month that the \"odds\" of Harris getting a subpoena to appear before the House Oversight Committee are \"very high.\"\nINSIDE THE BIDEN COVER-UP PROBE: 8 AIDES QUESTIONED, MORE ON THE WAY\nWhile Marshall told Fox News Digital that Harris should testify, he admitted, \"I don't think you need her testimony to show Americans what I knew as a physician a long time ago, that Joe Biden had a neurodegenerative disease of some sort.\"\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS FLOAT GRILLING JOE, JILL BIDEN AS FORMER AIDES STONEWALL COVER-UP PROBE\nMarshall has a medical degree from the University of Kansas and practiced medicine for more than 25 years before running for public office.\n\"All you had to do is look at his very fixed, flat face,\" Marshall explained. \"Look at his gait, the way he walked. He had a shuffled walk. He didn't move his arms, hardly at all. When he talked, it was very monotone, a very soft voice. He had malingering thought processes. I don't think it took much to figure that out.\"\nAfter listing the former president's symptoms, the Kansas senator lamented that Biden \"turned weakness into war,\" creating a national security threat.\nDuring Biden's presidency, the United States' withdrawal from Afghanistan resulted in the death of 13 U.S. soldiers, Russia invaded Ukraine and Hamas attacked Israel, triggering the ongoing war in Gaza.\nBut as Republicans demand transparency, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Fox News Digital that he is far more worried about the \"challenges we face right now,\" particularly on the economy, inflation and the impact of Trump's tariff policies.\nMeanwhile, Sen. John Hoeven R-N.D., defended the accountability argument, telling Fox News Digital that Americans \"always want more information and more transparency.\"\n\"If you're involved in an administration, you [should] always be willing to come in and say what you did and why you did it, and you know what it's all about. I mean, that's how it works, and that's what the American people want,\" he said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News Digital reached out to Biden and Harris for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\nFox News Digital's Elizabeth Elkind contributed to this report."

      "text": "Former National Security Advisor John Bolton, who served under President Donald Trump's first administration, was the subject of FBI raids at his home and office Friday morning as federal authorities searched for classified documents.\nThe raids follow a storied history between Trump and Bolton that has devolved into the pair trading repeated political blows on the public stage.\nNews broke early Friday morning that FBI agents flocked around Bolton's Maryland home and were seen carrying out boxes, which was followed hours later by the FBI raiding Bolton's Washington, D.C., office.\n\"I'm not a fan of John Bolton,\" Trump told reporters on Friday morning after the raids began, adding he saw the reports but was not aware of details on the raid ahead of time. \"He's a real sort of a lowlife.\"\nJOHN BOLTON BLASTED BY TRUMP ALLY ROGER STONE, WHO FACED BIDEN FBI RAID: 'KARMA IS A B----'\n\"He\u2019s a very quiet person, except on television, if he can say something bad about Trump,\" Trump added. \"He's not a smart guy, but he could be a very unpatriotic guy. We\u2019re going to find out.\"\nThe remarks echo years of past comments the pair have shared in public forums airing their dissatisfactions with one another, most notably after Trump tapped Bolton to serve as his national security advisor in 2018.\nFox News Digital took a look back at the pair's relationship since Trump's mad dash to fill his first administration in 2017, through his ouster of Bolton as the national security advisor and the ongoing clashes the pair have shared since.\nTRUMP\u2013BOLTON FEUD BACK IN FOCUS AFTER FBI RAID: 'NEVER HAD A CLUE \u2026 WHAT A DOPE!'\n\"I like (Bolton),\" Trump said in 2015 while appearing on \"Meet the Press\" just weeks after announcing his candidacy for the White House. \"I think he\u2019s, you know, a tough cookie, knows what he\u2019s talking about.\"\nBolton was first speculated as a likely pick to serve as Trump's secretary of state in December 2016, when Trump was preparing for his first inauguration after his upset victory over Hillary Clinton in the election that year. Pundits touted Bolton as an experienced foreign policy hawk who could bolster Trump's diplomatic agenda, and conservative outlets such as the National Review's editorial board implored the Trump transition team to choose Bolton, identifying him as a \"hard-headed realist whose focus is always the national interest.\"\nJAMES COMER PRAISES KASH PATEL FOR 'HOLDING DEEP STATE ACCOUNTABLE' AS FBI RAIDS JOHN BOLTON'S HOME\nTrump, however, ultimately tapped Rex Tillerson to serve as secretary of state.\nBolton showered Trump with praise of his own ahead of his confirmation as national security advisor in 2018, calling the president \"a terrific guy\" who \"knows a lot\" when the administration kicked off in 2017.\nThe warm relationship got cozier when Trump announced in 2018 on X that he called on Bolton to serve as his national security advisor\n\"I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9.\"\n\"I didn\u2019t really expect that announcement this afternoon,\" Bolton said on Fox News shortly after the announcement. \"But it\u2019s obviously a great honor and always an honor to serve our country.\"\nThe pair found common ground on issues such as withdrawing the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal, which was an Obama-era agreement with other world powers to limit Iran's nuclear capabilities.\nTrump ultimately pulled the U.S. out of the agreement in 2018, slamming it as a \"horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,\" and was backed by his hawkish group of foreign policy advisors, such as Bolton and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\nBolton\u2019s relationship with Trump began to sour as he advanced hard-line strategies toward U.S. adversaries, including Iran and North Korea. He had long advocated regime change in Tehran, though he later clarified in his role as national security advisor that American policy was \"not regime change,\" but rather a push for \"massive change in the regime\u2019s behavior.\" Trump, by contrast, initially favored a more diplomatic path, urging that flaws he saw in the Iran nuclear deal be renegotiated before ultimately deciding to withdraw from the agreement altogether.\nBOLTON TWEET DURING RAID SHOWS FOCUS WAS ELSEWHERE AS FBI SEARCHED HIS HOUSE\n\"John Bolton is absolutely a hawk. If it was up to him, he\u2019d take on the whole world at one time, okay?\" Trump said of Bolton in June 2019, underscoring the bubbling tensions between the two on foreign policy.\nIn April 2018, Bolton suggested North Korea follow Libya\u2019s example of denuclearization, which he called the \"Libya model,\" and included the country giving up its nuclear weapons in 2003 in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Bolton's comments about such a model for North Korea set off condemnation in Pyongyang as they raised concerns this would lead to potential regime change.\nTrump cited the comment following Bolton's abrupt exit from the White House in September 2019.\n\"We were set back very badly when John Bolton talked about the Libyan model \u2026 what a disaster,\" Trump told reporters at the time.\nDays ahead of Bolton's ouster, Trump was slated to meet with Taliban leaders in an effort to negotiate peace in Afghanistan, but the meeting never took place and Bolton reportedly slammed such an effort in conversations with Trump, media outlets reported at the time.\nBolton was ousted from his role as national security advisor Sept. 10, 2019, with Trump characterizing the departure as a firing, and Bolton saying he tendered his resignation and was not fired.\nJOHN BOLTON'S HOME RAIDED BY FEDERAL AGENTS, SOURCES SAY\n\"I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,\" Trump tweeted in 2019. \"I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week.\"\nBolton shot back on X that he \"offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow.'\"\nThe former national security advisor was replaced by Robert C. O'Brien, with Trump and Bolton continuing their contentious relationship years later.\nThe raid on Bolton's home is part of the \"early stages of an ongoing investigation into John Bolton,\" Vice President JD Vance said Friday during an appearance on \"Meet the Press.\" Bolton was not arrested or in custody amid the early morning raids.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe searches are focused on potential classified documents agents believe Bolton may still possess, Fox News reported."

      "text": "Psychologists predicted Trump\u2019s 2024 win before a single vote was cast \u2014 here\u2019s how they did it\nPsychologists pulled off what political pundits and polls failed to do: predict the 2024 presidential election winner.\nBefore a single ballot was cast in 2024, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania say they already predicted Donald Trump as the winner by tracking how optimistically each candidate explained bad news.\nWhile Trump\u2019s tone grew increasingly upbeat in the final weeks of the campaign, Kamala Harris\u2019s stayed flat. That shift correctly forecast not just that Trump would win, but by how much, according to a new study from Penn\u2019s Positive Psychology Center.\n\u201cStarting around October 10 or so, Trump started to get significantly more optimistic,\u201d Martin Seligman, the study\u2019s co-author and a professor of psychology at Penn, told The Post. \u201cBy the 27th, it was a very large difference between Harris and Trump.\u201d\nThe team analyzed 1,389 explanations of negative events \u2014 such as war, crime, or economic hardship \u2014 from both candidates. Their dataset drew from speeches, interviews, and their only presidential debate, all delivered between early September and October 27.\nEach explanation was scored using the CAVE method, or Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanations, a positive psychology technique that analyzes how people explain events in speech or writing. Researchers used it to measure optimism by assessing whether causes were described as temporary, specific, and fixable.\nThe narrower and solvable the cause, the more \u201coptimistic\u201d the candidate\u2019s message.\nTrump referenced more than 1,000 negative issues or events \u2014 over four times the number cited by Harris \u2014 often blaming outside forces while insisting the problems were fixable, usually by himself, the study found.\nHarris, by contrast, described deep, lasting threats with little sense of resolution, Seligman said.\nTo see whether any other speech patterns could have predicted the results, the researchers also looked at emotional tone, focus on past vs. future and language about control or responsibility. None of them tracked with the outcome. Optimism stood alone.\nSeligman\u2019s earlier research found that more optimism predicted the winner in 9 out of the 10 elections between 1948 and 1984.\nAfter that, he advised both political parties on using optimism in their campaigns. But when candidates began scripting fake optimism, he shelved the method.\nHe only revived it this cycle because Trump\u2019s off-the-cuff style allowed for real-time analysis.\nThe researchers encrypted their prediction before Election Day and shared it with four outside verifiers, including Wall Street Journal reporters Lara Seligman \u2014 daughter of Martin Seligman \u2014 and Al Hunt, University of Washington political scientist Dan Chirot, and Hope College psychologist Dave Myers, before publishing the results after the race.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only people who predicted a Trump election, as far as I know,\u201d Seligman said.\nA separate forecasting model, based on economic conditions and presidential approval ratings, was developed by Cornell University professor Peter Enns and also correctly predicted Trump\u2019s win in all 50 states.\nThe findings suggest voters respond more favorably to optimistic candidates who present problems as fixable rather than systemic \u2014 and that Trump\u2019s tendency to \u201cgo off script\u201d gave researchers an authentic glimpse of his true mindset, Seligman said.\n\u201cWhen optimism is genuine, I think there\u2019s a lot of reason to believe that the American public wants optimism and wants hope,\u201d he said. \u201cIt speaks to the general optimistic slant of American history.\u201d"

I really like this where she says she\u2019s going to sue him for a billion dollars.\u201d\n\u2018If Hunter loses, it\u2019s going to be weird for him writing a woman a check because she\u2019s not a prostitute,\u201d said Maher, drawing chuckles and applause.\nThe first lady put Biden on notice Wednesday that she\u2019ll sue him unless he apologizes and takes down a podcast video where he made the false claim.\nHowever, Biden crassly brushed aside Melania Trump\u2019s threat during an interview on YouTube show \u201cChannel 5 with Andrew Callaghan\u201d released Thursday.\n\u201cF\u2013k that. That\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Biden said with an arrogant smile.\nBoth the president and first lady have said they met in 1998 during a New York Fashion Week party hosted by businessman Paolo Zampolli.\nFederal investigators in 2023 raised the possibility of charging first son Hunter Biden for crimes related to sex trafficking.\nJustice Department Tax Division prosecutor Jack Morgan outlined nine instances in which then-President Joe Biden\u2019s son appeared to be communicating with prostitutes and coordinating their travel across state lines, in an October 2020 email to Assistant US Attorney Lesley Wolf released by the House Ways and Means Committee\nHunter Biden had been staring at jail time after being found guilty in 2024 of illegal possession of a firearm and also pleaded guilty to charges in another indictment for willful refusal to pay $1.4 million in taxes. However, he was later pardoned by his father."

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.

By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications.
