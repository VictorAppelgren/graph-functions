  "content": "A new report from Appfigures shows ChatGPT firmly leading the pack in revenue per download among the top AI assistant apps. Here\u2019s the breakdown.\n\nAccording to the report (via TechCrunch), since launching in May 2023, the ChatGPT app has generated $2 billion in global consumer spending across iOS and Android, with a 673% year-over-year surge in 2025 alone.\n\nAppfigures also says the app has been downloaded 318 million times so far this year, 2.8 times more than in the same period last year.\n\nIndia leads in lifetime installs, accounting for 13.7% of total downloads, followed by the U.S. with 10.3%. Still, when it comes to spending, U.S. users make up nearly 40% of the app\u2019s total revenue to date, with average spending per download reaching $10. Germany is a distant second, at 5.3%.\n\nChatGPT also leads in global lifetime revenue per install, with an average of $2.91, followed by Claude at $2.55, Grok at $0.75, and Copilot at $0.27.\n\nAs TechCrunch points out, Grok\u2019s later arrival on mobile may have played a role in its lower total lifetime global revenue per user. While xAI launched the chatbot in November 2023, Grok didn\u2019t get a standalone iOS app until January 2025, followed by its Android release in March.\n\nToday\u2019s report comes just days after Elon Musk accused Apple of unfairly favoring OpenAI, claiming it\u2019s \u201cimpossible\u201d for any other chatbot to top the App Store charts.\n\nAnd while the claim was quickly debunked (even by Grok), today\u2019s data shows how wide the gap really is, and how it goes beyond app installs. So far in 2025, ChatGPT has earned $1.35 billion in mobile revenue, 53 times more than Grok, which comes in second place with $25.6 million.\n\nDo you subscribe to any chatbot apps?

      "text": "ChatGPT\u2019s mobile app is raking in the revenue.\nSince launching in May 2023, ChatGPT\u2019s app for iOS and Android devices has reached $2 billion in global consumer spending, according to a new analysis by app intelligence provider Appfigures. That figure is approximately 30x the combined lifetime spending of ChatGPT\u2019s rivals on mobile, including Claude, Copilot, and Grok, the analysis indicates.\nSo far this year, ChatGPT\u2019s mobile app has made $1.35 billion, up 673% year-over-year from the $174 million it made during the same period (January-July) in 2024, per the data. On average, the app is generating close to $193 million per month, up from $25 million last year.\nThat\u2019s significantly higher \u2014 or about 53x higher \u2014 than ChatGPT\u2019s next nearest competitor, Grok, which made approximately $25.6 million this year to date. Grok\u2019s average monthly consumer spending is estimated at $3.6 million, or 1.9% of ChatGPT\u2019s.\nThis data suggests that other consumer chatbots still have a way to go to catch up with ChatGPT\u2019s dominance on mobile devices, even if the numbers don\u2019t provide a complete picture of the AI companies\u2019 overall revenue. Consumers, teams, and businesses can also subscribe to AI plans on the web, and the companies generate revenue in other ways, too, like via their APIs.\nRather, this new data offers a window into the apps\u2019 traction with consumers, who discover and pay for these AI assistants via the mobile app stores.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that when xAI\u2019s Grok launched in November 2023 (after ChatGPT), Grok didn\u2019t initially have stand-alone iOS or Android apps. Instead, users interacted with the AI chatbot through the X platform. Grok only became available on mobile devices through its own iOS app as of early January 2025 and has been on Google Play since March 4.\nStill, ChatGPT\u2019s lifetime global spending per download is $2.91, compared to Claude\u2019s $2.55, Grok\u2019s $0.75, and Copilot\u2019s $0.28, Appfigures found.\nIn the U.S., ChatGPT\u2019s spending per download to date is even higher, at $10, leading the market to account for 38% of the app\u2019s revenue to date. Germany is the second-largest market, accounting for 5.3% of ChatGPT\u2019s lifetime total spending.\nChatGPT\u2019s lead can also be seen in terms of downloads. To date, the app has been installed an estimated 690 million times globally, compared with Grok\u2019s 39.5 million. (That puts X owner Elon Musk\u2019s recent complaints about the App Store\u2019s alleged favoritism of ChatGPT in its Top Charts into better context.)\nAverage monthly downloads of ChatGPT globally are now at approximately 45 million, up 180% from about 16 million in January through July of 2024.\nIn 2025 so far, ChatGPT\u2019s app has been downloaded 318 million times, or 2.8x more than the 113 million it saw during the same period last year. By the number of installs, however, India is the top market, accounting for 13.7% of lifetime downloads, compared with second place, the U.S., which accounted for 10.3% of all downloads."

      "text": "Elon Musk is (once again) going after Apple, this time accusing the company of an \u201cunequivocal antitrust violation\u201d for allegedly favoring OpenAI in the App Store\u2019s AI rankings. Here are the details.\nA bit of context\nLast month, xAI released Grok 4, its latest large language model, promising major performance gains over leading competitors. Since then, the company has also rolled out features like Grok Imagine, its image and video generator, as well as customizable \u201ccompanion\u201d chatbots.\nDuring the same time period, according to data from App Figures, the Grok app climbed from around 60th to 29th place in the overall App Store rankings last week.\nEarlier today, xAI made Grok 4 free for users worldwide, helping the app climb further to fifth place in the overall App Store rankings, and second in the Productivity category.\nStill, that hasn\u2019t been enough to dethrone OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, which has spent the better part of the past year hovering at, or near, the top of Apple\u2019s charts.\nFor the past year, Apple has also repeatedly featured ChatGPT in its App Store editorial content. More significantly, it partnered with OpenAI as part of its new Apple Intelligence rollout, which includes direct Siri integration and support for the Writing Tools feature.\nBut what about the lawsuit?\nEarlier tonight, Elon Musk posted the following on X:\nIt\u2019s unclear what exactly triggered his threat of legal action, but if history is any guide, he\u2019ll likely post more about it as his supporters egg him on. So his reasoning behind the move may become more apparent as the hours and days progress.\nMusk, of course, co-founded OpenAI before parting ways with the organization early on. More recently, he sued the company in an effort to block its transition to a for-profit model, a case still making its way through the courts.\nAt the same time, he\u2019s also been competing directly with OpenAI with xAI. So it\u2019s possible his latest grievance with the App Store is just an extension of that broader fight, and that he sees Apple\u2019s platform as playing a key and anticompetitive role in OpenAI\u2019s continued success.\nBe that as it may, Musk has a history of threatening legal action without always following through, so whether tonight\u2019s post amounts to anything remains to be seen. For now, we\u2019ll have to wait and see if he offers more context, or if xAI actually moves forward with a lawsuit in the coming days.\nDo you think Apple is giving OpenAI an unfair advantage on the App Store? Let us know in the comments.\nUpdate 10:25 p.m. ET: A few hours before the lawsuit threat, Musk had published this post in which he asked Apple why it \u201crefuse(d) to put either \ud835\udd4f or Grok in your \u2018Must Have\u2019 section when \ud835\udd4f is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps.\u201d His post quoted a Tesla fan account, claiming that \u201cthe people\u201d had spoken, and that X was the top news app in the U.S.\nAirPods deals on Amazon\n- AirPods Max, USB-C Charging: $479.99 ($549 off)\n- AirPods Pro 2, USB-C Charging: $169 ($80 off)\n- AirPods 4 USB-C Charging: $99 (was $129)\n- AirPods 4, USB-C and Wireless Charging: $148.99 (was $179)\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "Last night, Elon Musk took to X to complain about the fact that Apple never seems to feature either X or Grok on the App Store. He claimed the company was unfairly favoring ChatGPT, and said xAI would take \u201cimmediate legal action\u201d. Today, Apple responded.\nApple highlights safety as a feature criteria\nIn a statement to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple said:\nMusk\u2019s claims came after he grew frustrated that, despite the X app topping the News chart yesterday, it never seemed to be featured on the App Store, apparently making it harder to climb the overall rankings.\nLikewise, over the past few days, and despite launching new features and making Grok 4 free for all users, the Grok app only reached fifth place overall and second in the Productivity category.\nTop comment by Mark Langston\nIf Musk actually files this suit, which I doubt he will, he'll be open to discovery, meaning his business practices will be under scrutiny and could reveal a lot of dirty laundry and secrets he may not want revealed.\nLet's keep in mind that Musk tweeted that Trump was in the Epstein files, which means he knowingly worked for, campaigned with, shilled for and funded a presidential campaign in the hundreds of millions for a PDF.\nAnyway, this is just the tweet of the day and won't go any further.\nBy contrast, he claimed that Apple\u2019s constant promotion of ChatGPT made it \u201cimpossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store,\u201d a claim quickly and easily debunked by xAI\u2019s own Grok, following a heated exchange between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman:\nAs for the lawsuit, despite Musk\u2019s promise of \u201cimmediate legal action\u201d by xAI, no suit appears to have been filed today.\nApple\u2019s statement to Gurman suggests it\u2019s taking the threat seriously, but its pointed use of the word \u201csafe\u201d is a not-so-subtle nod to Grok\u2019s recent controversies (including antisemitic content and the release of sexualized companion chatbots), which may disqualify it as a recommendation-worthy app in the company\u2019s view.\nWhat did you think of Apple\u2019s response to Musk\u2019s threat?

The U.S. accounts for roughly 40\u202f% of revenue, averaging $10 spent per download, while India leads in installs.  ChatGPT also tops lifetime revenue per install at $2.91, far ahead of rivals Claude ($2.55), Grok ($0.75) and Copilot ($0.27).  Musk\u2019s recent claim that Apple unfairly favors OpenAI is contradicted by the data, which shows ChatGPT\u2019s dominance in both downloads and revenue across the App Store. ",
