  "title": "Walmart CEO Says Lower And Middle Income Consumers Hit Most - Walmart (NYSE:WMT)",
  "description": "Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) reported Q2 results and raised annual outlook. EPS missed estimates, but sales exceeded expectations. Stock trading lower.",
  "content": "Walmart Inc. WMT shares are trading lower in the premarket session on Thursday, after the company reported second-quarter results and raised its annual outlook.\n\nThe retail giant reported adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents, missing the analyst consensus estimate of 74 cents.\n\nQuarterly sales of $177.40 billion, up 4.8% year over year, outpaced the Street view of $176.16 billion. Total revenues on a constant currency basis increased 5.6%.\n\nWalmart reported a 4.6% increase in U.S. comparable sales (excluding fuel), while Sam's Club U.S. comparable sales (excluding fuel) rose 5.9%.\n\nIn the Walmart U.S. segment, transactions grew 1.5%, while average ticket rose 3.1%.\n\nIn Sam's Club U.S., transactions rose 3.9% and the average ticket grew 2.0%\n\nAdjusted operating income fell 0.8% year-over-year to $7.87 billion in the quarter under review, lower than $7.940 billion a year ago. The GAAP operating income fell 8.2% year-over-year to $7.29 billion.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin slipped 10 basis points to 6.5%. Walmart said the decrease was primarily due to net sales growing faster than adjusted operating income.\n\nThe gross margin rate, however, improved by four basis points, primarily driven by Walmart U.S, partially offset by pressure in International. Quarterly margins gained from \"continued benefits from strong inventory management in the U.S. and improved business mix; partially offset by merchandise category mix pressure.\"\n\nThe company's global advertising segment expanded by 46%, bolstered by contributions from VIZIO.\n\nIn the U.S., Walmart Connect recorded a 31% increase, reflecting strong momentum in its retail media operations.\n\nMembership and other income rose 5.4%, supported by a 15.3% increase in global membership income.\n\nWalmart exited the quarter with cash and equivalents worth $9.431 billion, higher than $8.811 billion a year ago.\n\nWalmart raised its fiscal year 2026 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $2.52\u2013$2.62 from the prior $2.50\u2013$2.60, compared to the $2.62 analyst estimate.\n\nIt raised the annual revenue growth outlook (in constant currency) to 3.75% to 4.75% year over year, translating to an increase from $694.735 billion to $701.480 billion (prior outlook) to $703.151 billion to $709.928 billion versus the $706.209 billion consensus.\n\nWalmart projects that the third quarter adjusted earnings per share will range from 58 to 60 cents, above the 57 cents estimate. The company expects constant currency sales between $175.95 billion and $177.64 billion, compared to the $176.33 billion estimate.\n\nHowever, the retailer cautioned that there would be approximately a 140-bps headwind from the VIZIO acquisition.\n\nWalmart's CEO reportedly said the company is seeing its costs increase week after week as it replenishes inventory at post-tariff price levels.\n\nHe added that tariff-related costs are expected to rise further into the third and fourth quarters.\n\nHe also noted that middle and lower income customers are making more adjustments than higher-income shoppers in discretionary categories where prices have climbed.\n\nDuring the conference call, Walmart's CFO reportedly said the company is closely monitoring customer demand and adjusting purchasing quantities as it gauges the price elasticity of tariff-impacted items.\n\nWatch the live coverage of the Walmart conference call here\n\nPrice Action: WMT shares are trading lower by 3.16% to $99.33 premarket at last check Thursday.\n\u2022 Top 2 Financial Stocks You May Want To Dump In Q3",

      "text": "As of Aug. 19, 2025, two stocks in the financial sector could be flashing a real warning to investors who value momentum as a key criteria in their trading decisions.\nThe RSI is a momentum indicator, which compares a stock\u2019s strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices go down.

Same-store sales contracted by 1.9%, better than Street expectations of a 3.2% decline, reflecting a 1.3% decline in traffic comp and 0.6% ticket declines, he added.\nGross margin contraction to 29% reflects \"higher markdowns, purchase order cancellation costs and pressure from category mix,\" the analyst wrote. Target announced the departure of CEO Brian Cornell and that he would be replaced by current COO Michael Fiddelke, he further stated.\nJPMorgan: Target reported mixed quarterly results but maintained its full-year guidance, Horvers said. The current Street expectations are at the low end of the guidance, \"suggesting the potential for estimates to move higher post-earnings,\" he added.\nThe departure of the CEO signals that Target will remain a merchant in discretionary categories to differentiate itself from Amazon.com Inc AMZN and Walmart Inc WMT, the analyst stated. It also indicates that the company \"is unlikely to go on a significant capex/spending spree to build out a fulfillment operation for its growing marketplace offering,\" he further wrote.\nTGT Price Action: Shares of Target had declined by 7.72% to $97.25 at the time of publication on Wednesday.\nRead More:\n\u2022 Target Outgoing CEO Warns Of Short-Term Tariff Pressure, Stock Sinks\nPhotos: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
