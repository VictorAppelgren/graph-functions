  "content": "You can gauge the greatness of a spectacular long-range strike in several ways.\n\nThere are the prosaic measurements of speed, distance and the apex which the ball reaches. You may well factor in the stage on which it is executed and its importance in the context of a game.\n\nKieron Bowie\u2019s outrageous dipping strike against FK Partizan on Thursday ticked every box.\n\nThe Hibs forward was closer to 40 yards from goal than 30 when he took aim. His left foot seemed to send the ball halfway to the moon before it landed in the top-right corner. Without it, Hibs\u2019 hopes of reaching the play-off round of the Conference League were fading.\n\nPerhaps the best assessment of a moment no one present will ever forget came from the man of the moment.\n\n\u2018I think their goalie was speaking to Martin Boyle after the game, asking why I shot,\u2019 revealed Bowie. \u2018So, that just sums it up really.\u2019\n\nIt certainly did. When Bowie rolled two opponents while contesting a long punt up the field, there wasn\u2019t a man, woman or child in the 19,377 crowd who considered that beating Marko Milosevic was even a vague possibility.\n\nIt was a truly astonishing strike, one which many present will never have seen bettered and probably never will.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t feel like I needed to make something happen,\u2019 insisted Bowie. \u2018But, at half-time, Sammy (goalkeeping coach Craig Samson) spoke to me, telling me there was a goal in this for me. I didn\u2019t think it would be like that.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve obviously shielded two of them off, and then it\u2019s just sat up lovely and I\u2019ve just hit it. And I\u2019ll never do that again, probably.\n\n\u2018When it went in, it felt unbelievable. The whole crowd erupted. Everyone was going mental on the bench, so I ran over there. Everyone was surrounding me. That was amazing.\u2019\n\nWhile it was worthy of winning any game, that honour in fact would fall to Chris Cadden.\n\nOn a night brimming with drama, Bowie\u2019s goal only nudged his side ahead on aggregate after a pair of unfathomable errors in the first half from goalkeeper Jordan Smith.\n\nReduced to 10 men, Partizan\u2019s young side showed incredible spirit to level in the 95th minute and take the tie the distance.\n\nMany a Hibs team of the past would have been flummoxed by that. But the one David Gray has moulded is made of sterner stuff.\n\n\u2018I mean, they score like, what, five seconds before the end?\u2019 asked Bowie. \u2018And my head\u2019s gone. Like, I\u2019m just shouting into the sky.\n\n\u2018But we showed the character that we\u2019ve had throughout. You\u2019ve seen that, back to Aberdeen when we drew 3-3 here.\u2019\n\nEven without a goal which has immediately entered Hibs\u2019 folklore, Bowie\u2019s display was outstanding.\n\nThere were two moments in the first half where he left his station, tracked back and regained possession with clean sliding tackles.\n\nSat high in the main stand, Scotland manager Steve Clarke would have been impressed with everything the man from Kirkcaldy did. The first cap Bowie won in Liechtenstein in June will not be his last as the World Cup qualifiers come into view.\n\n\u2018I feel like that\u2019s a big thing, winning tackles, tracking back,\u2019 reflected the 22-year-old. \u2018That boosts the crowd.\n\n\u2018I feel like I just need to try and put myself in that shop window (for Scotland) and hopefully I can keep doing that.\n\n\u2018As the weeks go on, I\u2019m playing more and more games, getting into my sharpness.\n\n\u2018I feel like I\u2019m getting there, I\u2019m almost fully fit now. You can see in my performances, it\u2019s not as slack as what I was last season.\u2019\n\nNone of this has come easy. Bowie started out as a 16-year-old in League One with hometown team Raith Rovers.\n\nA move to Fulham followed but he moved on loan to Northampton to get the first-team football he craved.\n\nThere were huge expectations when Hibs paid a \u2018significant fee\u2019 for him a year ago, but the four months he spent out with a serious hamstring injury was a desperate setback. This now feels like his moment.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m definitely improving as my games go on,\u2019 he added. \u2018I\u2019m just constantly trying to play as many games as I can and I\u2019ve done that. That\u2019s six starts in a row now and hopefully it can continue.\u2019\n\nUnder contract until 2028, the sky\u2019s the limit in terms of what he might achieve in his time in Leith.\n\nCapable of holding the ball up, blessed with game awareness and an eye for goal, he\u2019s a formidable talent whose reputation is starting to precede him.\n\nThe fact that the Serbs had a man sent off for fouls against him home and away is taken as a backhanded compliment.\n\n\u2018In the first leg, they tried to stay off me a little bit,\u2019 said Bowie. \u2018And then they get a bit angry because they\u2019re not getting the ball and then they make silly fouls. That gives me a chance to go at them and I thrive on that.\n\n\u2018They were scared to try and get too tight on me, because I could just turn them. Over both legs, that was very important to get us up the pitch.\u2019\n\nThe significance of the aggregate win was lost on no one. In this, the club\u2019s 150th anniversary season and 70 years on since reaching the semi-final of the first European Cup, this is a result which would have met with resounding approval from the legends of yesteryear.\n\nLegia Warsaw await in a shoot-out which comes with the prize of group-stage football.\n\nThey don\u2019t come bigger than that. Which is precisely how Bowie likes it.\n\n\u2018Nights like that are half the reason I came to this club, to get in Europe,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018We set ourselves the target of getting European group-stage football, no matter whether that was Europa or Conference League. Hopefully we can continue to have more big nights.\u2019",

      "text": "Hibs 2 Partizan 3 (4-3 on agg) Defeat on the night can't stop Bowie-inspired Hibs progressing\nThis was the kind of match which takes years off managers and gives supporters flashbacks in the dark of night.\nIn a commanding position before a ball was kicked, Hibs almost conspired to throw away everything they\u2019d achieved in Belgrade last week.\nJust when it looked like those present would witness another painful capitulation, Kieron Bowie produced something which generations yet to be born will one day hear of.\nTo say the striker\u2019s dipping strike from 30 yards on the hour mark was a thing of wonder would scarcely do it justice.\nIt came just as his side most needed it. It changed the entire complexion of a game that was threatening to go badly wrong for David Gray\u2019s side. And it should have been enough.\nSeemingly over the line on aggregate, they were within seconds of progressing to the play-off round until Andrej Kostic dramatically levelled.\nHibernian's Kieron Bowie celebrates scoring a wonder goal to put Hibs ahead in the tie\nPartizan's Andrej Kostic scored at the death to send the match into extra time\nJordan Smith made two blunders to gift Partizan goals but made amends later on\nOn a night of extraordinary drama, though, they came again in extra-time, scoring through Chris Cadden to secure a clash with Legia Warsaw.\nHow they got there was at times hard to fathom. But get there, they did.\nIt was not a night that Jordan Smith Will recall with any fondness. Culpable as Milan Vukotic halved the aggregate score with a speculative strike from distance, the keeper made a hash of trying to prevent Jovan Milosevic\u2019s weak shot from crossing the line a half-time loomed.\nCredit is due to the keeper, however, for making some important saves thereafter.\nGray had ordered his players to play with a freedom, ignoring the result from the first leg. Easier said than one, you suspect.\nThe issue could have been all but settled just three minutes in. Martin Boyle gathered on the right and eliminated Mario Jurcevic with a twist of his hips.\nHis cross found Chris Cadden. The wing-back had the whole target to aim at yet fired straight at the keeper.\nWhile there was plenty of invention going forward as the game settled, the men in green looked nervous.\nChris Cadden grabbed the decisive goal in extra time to ensure Hibs progressed\nJack Iredale thinned a routine pass rom the box. Jovan Milosevic looked set the drive home the opener. Somehow Rocky Bushiri made up the ground and held off the striker until the cavalry arrived.\nThe game was ridiculously open. Partizan were in a rush to strike early and change the whole mood of the evening. On 17 minutes, their time came.\nNikola Simic took the ball on the half turn and played in Vukotic. The midfielder looked far too far from goal to ask a question of Smith but his strike from 27 yards arrowed towards goal.\nThe keeper got a hand to the ball and should comfortably have pushed it away to safety. The sight of it hitting the netting stunned the home supporters.\nIt took a whole for Hibs to rally. Bowie gathered Boyle\u2019s cross but couldn\u2019t get enough power on his strike from the edge of the box to work the keeper.\nA patient build-up ended with Dylan Levitt floating a cross to the far post.. Bushiri\u2019s header flashed a foot wide.\nToo many of Hibs\u2019 entries into the opposing box were of the hit-and-hope variety. Too fee of Gray\u2019s players were pausing for breath and making the right decisions.\nWhenever Partizan broke up the park, they did so in numbers. The efforts of the home side to stop them in the tracks were woefully inadequate.\nA concerning picture got a whole lot worse a minute from the break.\nJurcevic got in behind Chris Cadden down the left and cut the ball back to Milosevic. The strike lacked any real purchase. Smith seemed to have the ball in his grasp only for it to squirm through his arms and over the line.\nIt was a horrific error by the Englishman. He must have felt like the loneliest man in the world as he made his way back up the tunnel.\nAs well as Partizan had played up to that point, Gray\u2019s men had made it all too easy for them.\nInitially, it was not much better after the turnaround. Heavy touches. Bad decisions. Not enough options off the ball.\nIt needed something special to happen. And as the hour mark came up, that\u2019s what we witnessed.\nBowie did a decent job of rolling his marker as they contested a long ball. He was fully 30 yards from goal? Too far to try his luck, surely? What did we know.\nFrom the minute his left foot strike soared onto the air, the keeper was worried. It fell from the night sky and landed perfectly in the top corner. It was an astonishing goal. The place erupted. The was about to get a whole lot better for the Scots.\nAlready on a booking for dissent, Simic was sent packing for going through the back of Bowie. The balance of the tie had shifted dramatically.\nOff the bench, Nicky Cadden thought he\u2019d dragged his side level on the night until the flag went up.\nCredit to Smith where it\u2019s due. As the visitors pushed for the goal to take the game to extra-time, he denied Milosevic first with his knee than with his fingertips.\nAs we went into injury time, he dived full length to deny Yanis Karabelyov.\nStill Partizan came. And in the final minute of injury time, there was a dagger to the heart.\nA surge down the fight saw the ball eventually centred by Karabelyov. Substitute Andrej Kostic was most alive to the situation and hammered the ball high into the net. We were going the distance.\nWith the 10-man Serbs sitting in and looking for penalties, Hibs were able to find something.\nWith 10 minutes of the first period gone, Josh Mulligan charged in from the left and saw his shot spilled by Marko Milosevic. Cadden was alert and thumped the ball high on to the net.\nBowie was then inches away from claiming his second with a shot on the turn with Smith again denying Milosevic at the other end.\nThe second period saw Nicky Cadden miss with the goal gaping while Kostic hit the post. By the skin of their teeth, Hibs got there."

  "argos_summary": "Kieron Bowie scored a spectacular 30\u201140 yard dipping strike that gave Hibernian a narrow lead in the second leg of a UEFA Conference League tie against FK Partizan, sparking a dramatic turnaround. Partizan\u2019s late equaliser forced extra\u2011time, where Chris Cadden\u2019s goal sealed a 3\u20112 win for Hibs, sending them to a play\u2011off against Legia Warsaw. The match highlighted Hibs\u2019 resilience after a first\u2011leg defeat and a 10\u2011man disadvantage, while Bowie praised the moment and his personal development. The victory keeps the club\u2019s 150th anniversary season and European ambitions alive. ",
