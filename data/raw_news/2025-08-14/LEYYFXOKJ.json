  "content": "Michael King\u2019s stay off the injured list didn\u2019t last long.\n\nAfter making one start Saturday against the Red Sox, the Padres right-hander is heading back to the 15-day IL with knee inflammation.\n\nBefore that one outing, King had been out since May 18 with shoulder inflammation.\n\nThe injuries have limited King \u2014 who finished seventh in the National League Cy Young Award voting last year \u2014 to just 11 starts in 2025.\n\nWhen he has been able to pitch, though, King has been excellent with a 2.81 ERA and 1.09 WHIP with 65 strikeouts in 57 2/3 innings.\n\nIt\u2019s a notable loss for a San Diego team that not only sits ahead of the Dodgers in the NL West, but will also play a three-game series this weekend in Los Angeles.\n\nKing had been scheduled to start the series opener on Friday against Clayton Kershaw, but Randy Vasquez has been called up and is slated to either get the start or be a bulk pitcher, ESPN reported.\n\nEven without King for most of the summer, the Padres have been one of the hottest teams in baseball, particularly in August after the All-Star break.\n\nThe team is 9-3 this month and winners of five in a row, including a three-game sweep of the Giants. After holding a 3.19 ERA in July, the team has mostly held steady with a 3.60 mark in August.\n\nSan Diego\u2019s hot streak comes as the Dodgers have played middling ball for a good chunk of the summer, going 15-21 since the start of July.",

      "text": "A five-time Pro Bowl guard quietly retired earlier this year and it only came out after it was reported on in a spotlight feature done by his alma mater.\nBrandon Scherff retired from the NFL this summer after 10 years in the NFL, a 2025 Iowa Athletics Hall of Fame spotlight feature reported.\nScherff had played seven seasons with the Washington Commanders organization, earning Pro Bowl nods in 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\nThe NFL All-Pro \u2014 who earned the nod in 2020 \u2014 spent his last three seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nAll told, he made over $111 million over the life of four contract per Spotrac, three with Washington and his final deal with Jacksonville, a three-year, $49.5 million pact in 2022.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been something I could never dream of,\u201d he said in the feature. \u201cSometimes I would tell my wife that she has to pinch me, because I\u2019m playing a kid\u2019s game, and being able to do it as a job is pretty amazing. Now, having kids and being able to see them after games is absolutely wonderful. So I would say it\u2019s a dream come true. And I will be forever grateful to have had that chance.\u201d\nIn a post on X, NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport reported that teams had been told in the spring that he was retiring.\nScherff was the No. 5 overall pick in 2015 by Washington and during the course of his decade in the league, he played in \u2014 and started \u2014 140 games.\nScherff, a native of Iowa, was essential to Jacksonville\u2019s surprising run to the AFC Divisional Round in the 2022 playoffs.\nHe will turn 34 years old this coming December."

      "text": "Bodybuilding champion Hayley McNeff died last Friday, with the news confirmed on Wednesday.\nShe was 37.\nAccording to an obituary published on Boston.com, the death of the Concord, Mass., native was \u201cunexpected but peaceful.\u201d\n\u201cHayley was like a beam of light in this world. She had boundless energy and was very determined to achieve whatever she set out to do,\u201d Hayley\u2019s dad, Dave, told People in a statement. \u201cShe set her sights on bodybuilding and fitness and achieved the highest success that sector offered. She loved us and we love Hayley very much, we miss her madly.\u201d\nMcNeff\u2019s family is set to hold a service on Saturday and has asked for attendees to make a donation to the National Alliance on Mental Illness in McNeff\u2019s honor.\nPer the obituary, McNeff graduated from Concord-Carlisle High School and University of Massachusetts Amherst, and was an accomplished bodybuilder in the 2000s with state titles in Maryland and Delaware. She was also part of the 2005 documentary \u201cRaising the Bar,\u201d which highlights the world of the sport.\n\u201cThe quest for getting huge will never end,\u201d McNeff said about her career in the documentary. \u201cThere\u2019s no limit. I hope there\u2019s a day that I\u2019ll be able to look in the mirror 100% of the time and be like, \u2018Yeah man, I\u2019m huge.'\u201d\nAfter retirement from the sport, McNeff decided to pursue a graduate degree in psychology.\n\u201cShe had a gift for making those around her laugh and feel welcomed,\u201d the obituary reads. \u201cHer energy and determination was a constant in her life and she always accomplished what she set out to achieve. She treasured her friendships and nurtured strong, lasting relationships with those who knew her best. Hayley will be deeply missed by her parents, siblings, extended family, and friends.\u201d\nUpon hearing the news of McNeff\u2019s death, bodybuilding coach Dave Palumbo posted a tribute message on Instagram.\n\u201cI\u2019m sad to hear of the passing of former woman bodybuilder @hayleysmash (HAYLEY MCNEFF) \u2026 she left us way too soon,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShe was a good soul, super intelligent and had tremendous potential as a bodybuilder. She appeared in @dave_pulcinella RAISING THE BAR videos back in the day and I was proud to be able to call her a friend. Prayers to her family and friends. R.I.P. @official_rxmuscle.\u201d\nMcNeff is one of many bodybuilders who have recently passed away.\nZunila Hoyos Mendez died at 43 in June after she was killed in a hammer attack. A month prior, Gui Bull died at 30."
