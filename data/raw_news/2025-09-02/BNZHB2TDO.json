  "title": "Why is a 30-year-old Selena album charting again?",
  "description": "Sales of Selena's last album surged more than 30,000% in the last week.",
  "content": "More than 30 years after her tragic passing, Tejano icon Selena is once again topping the charts with one of her most famous recordings.\n\nSales of Selena's 1995 record, Dreaming of You, jumped more than 30,000 percent according to an analysis by music data firm Luminate. Dreaming of You, the Texas artist's last album, received a remaster and re-release in July for its 30th anniversary. According to Luminate, the re-release sold more than 6,100 copies over the last week, which is Luminate's most recent tracking period. That's opposed to double-digit sales in previous weeks.\n\nMost interestingly, driving that boom is vinyl sales. Dreaming of You debuted at No. 4 on the Vinyl Albums chart thanks to people scooping the re-release on wax. But Tejano fans aren't picking up the album at their local record shop. One reason that the remaster is surging in sales is that Target's exclusive vinyl version of the record was released on Aug. 15. Other versions that went up for pre-order in July began hitting music fans' mailboxes throughout the month, driving a delayed surge in sales. A brief search on TikTok for \"Selena\" shows that fans are flocking to Target to buy the double LP release, which comes with deep-red colored discs and a unique poster.\n\nSelena's new Target release isn't the first time the retailer has partnered with an artist for an exclusive release. As vinyl sales boom thanks to a surge of young record-buyers, Target has obtained the exclusive rights to sell special-edition CDs and vinyl records from artists including Conan Gray, The Weeknd, and various K-pop groups. They've also hit the jackpot by selling exclusive versions of Taylor Swift albums that feature Target-specific colored records and bonus content. It appears that Target has found another cash cow with Dreaming of You, and it's been beneficial for Selena's estate, too.\n\nDreaming of You's re-release is also topping other charts. It hit No. 1 on the Top Latin Pop albums chart and No. 8 on the Top Album Sales chart, the list of the best-selling albums in the United States for a given week. The record is once again proving its staying power; when it was released in 1995, it became the first predominantly Spanish-language album to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. Dreaming of You spent 44 weeks atop the Top Latin Albums Chart.\n\nFirst released on July 18, 1995, Dreaming of You was Selena's fifth and final studio album. The record's release came just months after Selena's murder at the hands of Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, the president of the singer's fan club. Dreaming of You is written in both Spanish and English, with the English-language tracks originally intended for a follow-up pop album planned before Selena's death. The critically acclaimed album sold more than 300,00 copies in its first week.",

      "text": "Selena returns to multiple Billboard charts this week \u2013 not with new material, but with one of her most famous recordings. The late Latin pop superstar sends Dreaming of You back to a handful of rankings, and the project even manages to debut on one list after being reissued in celebration of the groundbreaking effort\u2019s thirtieth anniversary.\nDreaming of You was remastered and offered for sale on different vinyls, as well as CDs and digital downloads, but it\u2019s purchases on wax that help Selena\u2019s album become a new win after so many years.\nDreaming of You\u2019s Sales Jump More Than 30,000%\nLuminate, the organization that collects sales and streaming data which is then used to compile the weekly Billboard charts, reports that Dreaming of You sold a little more than 6,100 copies in America in the most recent tracking period. The frame prior, the set only managed double-digit sales. In the span of only a few days, purchases of Dreaming of You grew by more than 30,500%, and it\u2019s all thanks to the thirtieth anniversary reissue.\nDreaming of You Debuts on the Vinyl Albums Chart\nAll those sales on wax bring Dreaming of You to the Vinyl Albums chart for the first time. Selena debuts her last release at No. 4. The talent reaches the highest tier on the vinyl albums roster for the third time, as both Amor Prohibido and Ones spent a single turn at number one.\nSelena Returns to No. 1\nDreaming of You even manages to conquer a Billboard chart, one that it didn\u2019t appear on the week before. Selena is back at No. 1 on the Top Latin Pop Albums ranking as Dreaming of You breaks back in and dominates the list once more. On that roster, the English/Spanish release is one of Selena\u2019s half-dozen leaders, and the set has ruled for 45 nonconsecutive frames.\nDreaming of You Bounces Back Onto Multiple Tallies\nSelena also returns to another two rankings thanks to Dreaming of You\u2019s reintroduction. On the Top Album Sales chart, the general list of the top-selling projects in the U.S., Selena is back at No. 8. Dreaming of You only makes it to No. 14 on the Top Latin Albums roster this time around, though the set has previously led the charge."
