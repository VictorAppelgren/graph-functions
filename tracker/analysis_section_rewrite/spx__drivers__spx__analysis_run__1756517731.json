      "feedback": "Your draft is essentially empty – it contains no causal chain, no canonical handle mapping, no catalysts, and no citations. To meet the Argos standards, rewrite it as follows:\n\n1. **Choose a focal asset** (e.g., ust10y, spx, or dxy) and state the view’s direction (↑/↓) and magnitude (e.g., +0.25 bp/‑0.5 %).\n2. **Map the view to at least one canonical handle** and provide a clear causal path (e.g., Fed policy → 10‑yr yield → spx). Use the naming convention (e.g., fed_policy → ust10y → spx).\n3. **Identify a dated catalyst window** (e.g., Fed policy meeting on Aug 15 2025) and explain how it will transmit to the handle (e.g., rate hike → yield rise → equity valuation).\n4. **Quantify** the expected impact using recent data or model outputs (e.g., a 25 bp hike would lift spx by ~0.15 % based on historical elasticity).\n5. **Cite** each claim with a source ID (e.g., (H86O3XRUJ)) and ensure the ID exists in the source material. Avoid generic statements; use concrete numbers or ranges.\n6. **Include a watch‑list** of decisive signals (e.g., Fed minutes, inflation data, earnings surprises) with dates and expected direction.\n7. **State fragility** (e.g., if the Fed signals dovish, the upside collapses) and possible invalidations.\n\nOnce you incorporate these elements, the analysis will satisfy the truth‑over‑verbosity rule, map to canonical handles, and provide actionable, time‑bound guidance.",
