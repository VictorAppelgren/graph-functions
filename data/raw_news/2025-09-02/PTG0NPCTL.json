  "content": "Listen below or on the go on Apple Podcasts and Spotify\n\nWall Street slides as renewed tariff uncertainty weighs. (00:31) Tesla falls short in India with about 600 orders since launch, Bloomberg News reports. (01:26) Meta created flirty chatbots of celebrities, including Taylor Swift, without consent: report. (02:10)\n\nThis is an abridged transcript.\n\nWall Street is looking at a negative start to September, with stock index futures down this morning.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield (US10Y) rose 2 basis points to 4.28%. The 2-year yield (US2Y) was flat at 3.64%.\n\nOne item of note happening today is that President Trump is set to make a statement from the Oval Office at 2pm.\n\nUBS' Paul Donovan said, \u201cThere are a number of topics the president may choose to address and a number of directions that may be taken on each of those topics. Uncertainty about policy has economic consequences\u2014relevant as markets consider the next employment report on Friday.\"\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has reportedly received orders for just over 600 cars since launching sales in India in mid-July.\n\nBloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that the number falls short of Tesla's own expectations.\n\nDeliveries will initially be limited to Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, and Gurugram, the report said, adding that the size of shipments is based on the full payments it has received for the cars as well as the company's ability to deliver outside the four cities where it has a physical presence.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) officially entered the Indian market in July with the launch of its Model Y electric SUV, priced at around \u20b96 million ($69,751).\n\nAnd now for a trending article on Seeking Alpha.\n\nMeta reportedly appropriated the names and likenesses of celebrities, including Taylor Swift, Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway and Selena Gomez, to develop dozens of flirty social-media chatbots\u2026and it was done without their consent.\n\nAccording to Reuters, several of these were created by users with a Meta tool for developing chatbots, but a Meta employee also produced at least three, including two Taylor Swift \u201cparody\u201d bots.\n\nThe report added that Meta also allowed users to develop publicly available chatbots of child celebrities, including a 16-year-old movie star.\n\nAll the virtual celebrities have been shared on Meta\u2019s social media platforms, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. In several weeks of Reuters testing to see the bots\u2019 behavior, the avatars often insisted they were the real actors and artists. The bots routinely made sexual advances, often inviting a test user for meetings, according to the report.\n\nMeta spokesperson Andy Stone told the news agency that the company's AI tools should not have created intimate images of adult celebrities or any photos of child artists. He also blamed Meta\u2019s production of images of female celebrities wearing lingerie on failures of the company\u2019s enforcement of its own policies, which forbid such content, the report added.\n\nMeta\u2019s rules also forbid \u201cdirect impersonation,\u201d but Stone said that the celebrity characters were acceptable so long as the company labeled them as parodies. Many were labeled but Reuters found that some were not.\n\nMeta deleted about a dozen of the bots, both \u201cparody\u201d avatars and unlabeled ones, shortly before the story was published.\n\nTrump says India offered to cut tariffs to zero, slams purchase of Russian oil and arms\n\nMetaplanet gains shareholder approval to raise up to $3.8 billion to buy more bitcoin\n\nBessent bets on Supreme Court upholding Trump tariffs but keeps backup plan ready - report\n\u2022 None The three-day Commercial UAV Expo will begin in Las Vegas. The conference is considered the leading international trade show and conference dedicated to commercial unmanned aerial systems. Workhorse Group (WKHS), Sony (SONY), Trimble (TRMB), KULR Technology Group (KULR) and Teledyne (TDY) are some of the companies scheduled to participate.\n\u2022 None Lucid Group (LCID) will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis after the company's 1-for-10 reverse stock split.\n\nWe\u2019ve already touched on Dow, S&P and Nasdaq futures.\n\nCrude oil is up 1.8% $65/barrel. Bitcoin is up 1.1% at $110,000. Gold is flat at $3,478.\n\nThe FTSE 100 is down 0.4% and the DAX is down 1%.\n\nThe biggest movers for the day premarket: Frontier Group Holdings (NASDAQ:ULCC) +8% - Shares surged after Deutsche Bank upgraded the low-cost carrier to buy from hold, citing its strong positioning to capture market share following Spirit Airlines\u2019 bankruptcy.",
