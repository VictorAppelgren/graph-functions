  "title": "Trump administration sues New York over sanctuary city policies",
  "description": "The lawsuit is the administration's latest effort to crack down on laws that limit local officials' cooperation with federal immigration authorities.",
  "content": "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi attends a press conference with FBI Director Kash Patel (not pictured) where they make an announcement in connection with a child sex abuse enforcement action, in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 7, 2025.\n\nThe Trump administration sued New York City on Thursday over its \"sanctuary\" laws, continuing a monthslong effort to crack down on localities that try to shield undocumented immigrants from federal detainment efforts.\n\n\"New York City has released thousands of criminals on the streets to commit violent crimes against law-abiding citizens due to sanctuary city policies. If New York City won't stand up for the safety of its citizens, we will,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said.\n\nIncluded in Trump's effort to drastically reduce the flow of unlawful immigration into the United States has been a concerted effort by his administration to crack down on so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, described as states, cities, counties or municipalities that enact laws that effectively prevent local officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.\n\nThe administration alleged New York's sanctuary city policies \"impede the Federal Government's ability to enforce the federal immigration laws\" and \"violate the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.\"\n\n\"New York City has long been at the vanguard of interfering with enforcing this country's immigration laws. Its history as a sanctuary city dates back to 1989, and its efforts to thwart federal immigration enforcement have only intensified since,\" the complaint reads.\n\nThe Trump Justice Department, meanwhile, said the city's immigration policies have the \"purpose\" and \"effect\" of making it more difficult for federal immigration officers to carry out their responsibilities.\n\n\"These provisions intentionally obstruct the sharing of information envisioned and affirmatively protected by Congress, including sharing basic information such as release dates, court appearance dates, and custodial status,\" the complaint reads.\n\nAmong the defendants named in the suit are New York Mayor Eric Adams; City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, a former mayoral candidate; and Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.\n\nIn the suit, filed in the Eastern District of New York, the administration asks the court to declare that the city's laws violate the Supremacy Clause and are therefore invalid. The administration also asked the court to permanently prohibit the city's departments and officials from enforcing the sanctuary city policies.\n\nMayor Adams had sought to establish a friendly relationship with administration officials, meeting with Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, before Trump's inauguration to discuss what he called a shared goal to remove violent immigrants from the city. Adams went as far as to publicly back a bill that would roll back parts of the city's sanctuary policies to better allow cooperation with the federal government, a move that ultimately would be up to the City Council to enact.\n\nDespite the early outreach, Homan this week sharpened his attacks on New York, which he has described as \"the biggest sanctuary city in this country,\" after an off-duty Customs and Border Protection agent was shot in the city. Several Trump administration officials, including Homan and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, attributed the shooting to the city's sanctuary policies. City officials have detained a person of interest and said the shooting was an attempted robbery that did not appear to be connected to the victim's job.\n\n\"The sanctuary cities are now our priority. We're going to flood the zone,\" Homan said Monday. \"So sanctuary cities got exactly what they don't want: more agents in the community and more agents in the worksite.\"\n\nAdams said he \"will review the lawsuit\" in a statement on X that also reiterated his support for re-examining local ordinances on immigration.\n\n\"We support the essence of the local laws put in place by the City Council \u2014 but I have also been clear that they go too far when it comes to dealing with those violent criminals on our streets and have urged the Council to reexamine them to ensure we can effectively work with the federal government to make our city safer,\" Adams said. \"So far, the Council has refused.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the city council said in a statement that city's law department is reviewing the lawsuit.\n\n\"Pam Bondi may want to distract from reality, but the facts are clear: the evidence consistently shows that cities with sanctuary laws are safer than those without them,\" the spokesperson said. \"When residents feel comfortable reporting crime and cooperating with local law enforcement, we are all safer, something both Republican and Democratic mayors of New York City have recognized. It is the Trump Administration indiscriminately targeting people at civil court hearings, detaining high schoolers, and separating families that make our city and nation less safe.\"\n\nThe city Corrections Department, the city Probation Department and the police department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAcross both of his presidential terms, Trump has threatened to withhold federal funds from sanctuary jurisdictions and prosecute state or local officials who impede enforcement actions to varying degrees of success.\n\nIn January, Trump signed an executive order directing Noem and Bondi to ensure sanctuary jurisdictions \"do not receive access to federal funds\" and to consider pursuing criminal or civil penalties if localities \"interfere with the enforcement of Federal law.\"\n\nA federal judge in April blocked the effort to withhold federal funds, finding that Trump's order violated the Constitution's separation of powers principles. The same judge blocked a similar effort by Trump in 2017.\n\nThe administration sued the state of New York this year over its \"Green Light Law,\" which allows the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants and limits the sharing of related data with federal immigration authorities. In addition, the law requires state officials to notify license holders when their information is requested. The Justice Department is seeking to have the law declared unlawful and unenforceable.\n\nIn addition to New York, the Trump administration has targeted other Democratic-leaning communities over policies it alleges impede federal authorities' ability to enforce immigration laws.\n\nThe administration sued the state of Illinois and city of Chicago in February, seeking to block the enforcement of a law that bars state and local law enforcement agencies from assisting the federal government with civil immigration enforcement absent a criminal warrant.\n\nIn June, the administration sued the city of Los Angeles over its immigration laws, arguing that they interfere and discriminate against federal agents by treating them differently from other law enforcement agents in California by restricting access to property and individual detainees. In the suit, the administration pointed to the laws as being behind recent clashes between federal immigration officials and protesters in Los Angeles last month.",

These policies reflect an intentional effort to obstruct federal law enforcement and thus are preempted under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\u201cNew York City has released thousands of criminals on the streets to commit violent crimes against law-abiding citizens due to sanctuary city policies,\u201d said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. \u201cIf New York City won\u2019t stand up for the safety of its citizens, we will.\u201d\n\u201cFor too long, New York City has been at the vanguard of interfering with enforcing our immigration laws,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate. \u201cIts efforts to thwart federal immigration enforcement end now.\u201d\nThe case, filed in the Eastern District of New York, is the latest action from the Justice Department fighting back against unlawful obstruction of enforcement of federal immigration laws. In the past three months, the Department has filed lawsuits against Los Angeles, New York State, Colorado, Illinois, the city of Rochester, New York, and several New Jersey cities to invalidate unconstitutional sanctuary policies. Recently, the Mayor of Louisville revoked the city\u2019s sanctuary policy after the Justice Department threatened legal action.\nRead the full complaint here."

      "text": "A California man was arrested on a 14-count federal indictment Thursday that alleges he used dating apps to con matches out of millions of dollars by posing as an investor, officials said.\nChristopher Earl Lloyd, 39, of Orange County, is accused of executing the scheme from April 2021 until February 2024, according to the indictment, released Thursday by the Justice Department in the Central District of California.\nThe indictment accuses Lloyd of using dating apps \u2014 like Tinder, Hinge and Bumble \u2014 \"to befriend and engage in romantic relationships with victims,\" whom he then lied to about his finances and career to get them to invest their money with him. When they sent him cash, he used it for his \"personal benefit,\" according to the federal indictment.\nLloyd told the victims that he had recently closed on multiple properties, that he had been a finance manager for years, that he was vice president of a company called 13 Holdings and that he worked for an investment company called Landmark Holdings \u2014 none of which was true, the indictment alleges.\nHe convinced his victims that he was knowledgeable about investments and encouraged them to send him their money for him to invest, according to the indictment.\nThe indictment alleges he promised that his victims would see \"regular returns\" on the money invested with him and that their investments were \"insured up to a significant amount.\" He also told them they could withdraw their funds at any time, the indictment says.\nTo legitimize the process, Lloyd signed contracts that \"specified the investments that the victims were to make\" and created \"a false schedule of returns on their investments,\" the indictment alleges. His victims sent money to a number of bank accounts he owned via wire, Zelle and Cash App or by using cash, it says.\n\"Rather than using the victims' funds for investments, defendant Lloyd largely spent it for his own personal benefit,\" the indictment says, including a 2023 incident in which he used $40,000 of his victims' money to write a check to a Lexus dealership in Southern California.\nThe federal indictment lists at least five victims who it says, on multiple occasions, wired Lloyd amounts that ranged from $15,500 to $110,000. In total, Lloyd collected more than $2 million from his victims through the scheme, it says.\nLloyd was charged with 13 counts of wire fraud and one count of engaging in a monetary transaction in property derived from the fraud, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office said in a release.\nHe made an initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana on Thursday afternoon and remains in federal custody.\nA lawyer representing Lloyd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIf he is convicted, Lloyd would face a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for each of the 13 wire fraud counts and up to 10 years in prison for the monetary transaction count."

      "text": "An off-duty Customs and Border Patrol agent was shot in New York City's Riverside Park late Saturday in an alleged robbery that did not appear to target him because of his job, police said.\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Monday that the perpetrators were two unauthorized immigrants who had been arrested multiple times. Both suspects have been detained, Noem said.\nNoem said the first suspect is a Dominican national named Miguel Francisco Mora Nunez, 21, who had allegedly been arrested four different times in New York City. New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a news conference Sunday that he was hospitalized with gunshot wounds that investigators believe he sustained during the incident.\nShortly after the news conference, Noem said on X that the second suspect was Christian Aybar-Berroa, who is also from the Dominican Republic. Noem said on X that Aybar-Berroa entered the country in 2022 and was ordered to leave a year later by an immigration judge.\nTwo law enforcement sources told NBC News that the encounter appeared to be random and that it was an attempted robbery.\nTisch said the CBP agent was sitting on the rocks along the water in the Manhattan park when two men rode up to him on a scooter and one of them got off, approaching him from behind.\nOne of the men took out a gun, at which point the agent realized he was being robbed and took out his firearm in defense, Tisch said. The gunman fired at the agent, who returned fire, she said.\nThe CBP agent was hit in the face and on the forearm, Tisch said. Mayor Eric Adams said he had visited the agent in the hospital as the agent recovered with family members. His condition was unknown.\nThe incident was caught on CCTV, allowing detectives to match Mora with the person shown firing at the CBP agent, Tisch said. Mora went to Bronx Care Hospital after midnight with gunshot wounds to the groin and a leg consistent with those sustained by the person who shot the agent, Tisch said, citing the security video.\nTrump highlights shooter's immigration status\nAdams said Mora is known by law enforcement and has had repeated and violent past encounters with officials.\nTisch said Mora is also in the United States illegally, having entered through Arizona in 2023.\nHe has two previous arrests for domestic violence in New York and an active warrant after he did not show up in court in one of those cases, Tisch said. Mora was also wanted by New York police in connection with an alleged robbery in December and an alleged stabbing in January, she said.\nMora was in police custody at Lincoln Hospital, where he had surgery, Tisch said.\nAdams said of Mora at the news conference Sunday: \"In less than one year, he has inflicted violence in our city. And once he is charged for last night's crimes, we will be able to add attempted murder to his rap sheet.\"\nPresident Donald Trump called the person of interest an \"Illegal Alien Monster\" on Truth Social on Sunday and said Democrats \"have flooded our Nation with Criminal Invaders.\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on X that Mora is from the Dominican Republic.\nTrump has long highlighted crimes committed by undocumented migrants as reasons for harsh immigration crackdowns, despite evidence showing that the undocumented population commits fewer crimes than natural-born U.S. citizens.\nExpert analysis and available data from major-city police departments reviewed by NBC News last year showed that despite some high-profile incidents, there was no evidence of a migrant-driven crime wave in the United States.\nIn December 2020, researchers studying Texas crime statistics found that \u201ccontrary to public perception, we observe considerably lower felony arrest rates among undocumented immigrants compared to legal immigrants and native-born U.S. citizens and find no evidence that undocumented criminality has increased in recent years.\u201d\nIn the first months of his second term, Trump and his administration have been cracking down on arrests of undocumented immigrants, with promises to deport violent criminals. Most of those in immigration custody, however, do not have criminal records, according to data.\nAs of June, after six months of aggressive immigration enforcement, only a small fraction of undocumented immigrants known by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers as having been convicted of sexual assault and homicide had been arrested, internal ICE data obtained by NBC News showed.\nFrom Oct. 1 through May 31, 185,042 people were arrested and booked into ICE facilities. Of that group, 65,041 had been convicted of crimes, the data showed.\nOther ICE data showed that nearly half of those in ICE custody had neither been convicted of nor been charged with any crime.\nIn a statement Monday, acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons said that \"sanctuary city policies and the Biden administration\u2019s open border policies allowed two criminal illegal aliens to enter this country, roam free and commit multiple crimes with no repercussions.\"\n\"Habitual criminals who weren\u2019t even supposed to be in the United States shot an off-duty federal officer in one perpetrator\u2019s second armed robbery this year,\" Lyons said. \"I\u2019m tremendously relieved that this CBP officer will recover, but the bottom line is that this shouldn\u2019t have happened.\""

      "text": "PROTECTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGAINST INVASION\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Purpose. Over the last 4 years, the prior administration invited, administered, and oversaw an unprecedented flood of illegal immigration into the United States. Millions of illegal aliens crossed our borders or were permitted to fly directly into the United States on commercial flights and allowed to settle in American communities, in violation of longstanding Federal laws.\nMany of these aliens unlawfully within the United States present significant threats to national security and public safety, committing vile and heinous acts against innocent Americans. Others are engaged in hostile activities, including espionage, economic espionage, and preparations for terror-related activities. Many have abused the generosity of the American people, and their presence in the United States has cost taxpayers billions of dollars at the Federal, State, and local levels.\nEnforcing our Nation\u2019s immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the United States. The American people deserve a Federal Government that puts their interests first and a Government that understands its sacred obligation to prioritize the safety, security, and financial and economic well-being of Americans.\nThis order ensures that the Federal Government protects the American people by faithfully executing the immigration laws of the United States.\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to faithfully execute the immigration laws against all inadmissible and removable aliens, particularly those aliens who threaten the safety or security of the American people. Further, it is the policy of the United States to achieve the total and efficient enforcement of those laws, including through lawful incentives and detention capabilities.\nSec. 3. Faithful Execution of the Immigration Laws. In furtherance of the policies described in section 2 of this order:\n(a) Executive Order 13993 of January 20, 2021 (Revision of Civil Immigration Enforcement Policies and Priorities), Executive Order 14010 of February 2, 2021 (Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework To Address the Causes of Migration, To Manage Migration Throughout North and Central America, and To Provide Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border), Executive Order 14011 of February 2, 2021 (Establishment of Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families), and Executive Order 14012 of February 2, 2021 (Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans) are hereby revoked; and\n(b) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all appropriate action to promptly revoke all memoranda, guidance, or other policies based on the Executive Orders revoked in section 3(a) of this order and shall employ all lawful means to ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States against all inadmissible and removable aliens.\nSec. 4. Civil Enforcement Priorities. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to enable the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to set priorities for their agencies that protect the public safety and national security interests of the American people, including by ensuring the successful enforcement of final orders of removal. Further, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that the primary mission of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations division is the enforcement of the provisions of the INA and other Federal laws related to the illegal entry and unlawful presence of aliens in the United States and the enforcement of the purposes of this order.\nSec. 5. Criminal Enforcement Priorities. The Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall take all appropriate action to prioritize the prosecution of criminal offenses related to the unauthorized entry or continued unauthorized presence of aliens in the United States.\nSec. 6. Federal Homeland Security Task Forces. (a) The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to jointly establish Homeland Security Task Forces (HSTFs) in all States nationwide.\n(b) The composition of each HSTF shall be subject to the direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, but shall include representation from any other Federal agencies with law enforcement officers, or agencies with the ability to provide logistics, intelligence, and operational support to the HSTFs, and shall also include representation from relevant State and local law enforcement agencies. The heads of all Federal agencies shall take all appropriate action to provide support to the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that the HSTFs fulfill the objectives in subsection (c) of this section, and any other lawful purpose that fulfills the policy objectives of this order.\n(c) The objective of each HSTF is to end the presence of criminal cartels, foreign gangs, and transnational criminal organizations throughout the United States, dismantle cross-border human smuggling and trafficking networks, end the scourge of human smuggling and trafficking, with a particular focus on such offenses involving children, and ensure the use of all available law enforcement tools to faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States.\n(d) The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to provide an operational command center to coordinate the activities of the HSTFs and provide such support as they may require, and shall also take all appropriate action to provide supervisory direction to their activities as may be required.\nSec. 7. Identification of Unregistered Illegal Aliens. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action to:\n(a) Immediately announce and publicize information about the legal obligation of all previously unregistered aliens in the United States to comply with the requirements of part VII of subchapter II of chapter 12 of title 8, United States Code;\n(b) Ensure that all previously unregistered aliens in the United States comply with the requirements of part VII of subchapter II of chapter 12 of title 8, United States Code; and\n(c) Ensure that failure to comply with the legal obligations of part VII of subchapter II of chapter 12 of title 8, United States Code, is treated as a civil and criminal enforcement priority.\nSec. 8. Civil Fines and Penalties. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of Treasury, shall take all appropriate action to ensure the assessment and collection of all fines and penalties that the Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized by law to assess and collect from aliens unlawfully present in the United States, including aliens who unlawfully entered or unlawfully attempted to enter the United States, and from those who facilitate such aliens\u2019 presence in the United States.\n(b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a report to the President regarding their progress implementing the requirements of this section and recommending any additional actions that may need to be taken to achieve its objectives.\nSec. 9. Efficient Removals of Recent Entrants and Other Aliens. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action, pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I)), to apply, in her sole and unreviewable discretion, the provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the INA to the aliens designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II). Further, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly take appropriate action to use all other provisions of the immigration laws or any other Federal law, including, but not limited to sections 238 and 240(d) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1228 and 1229a(d)), to ensure the efficient and expedited removal of aliens from the United States.\nSec. 10.

Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.

The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to:\n(a) Cooperate and effectively implement, as appropriate, the sanctions provided by section 243(d) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1253(d)), with the Secretary of State, to the maximum extent permitted by law, ensuring that diplomatic efforts and negotiations with foreign states include the foreign states\u2019 acceptance of their nationals who are subject to removal from the United States; and\n(b) Eliminate all documentary barriers, dilatory tactics, or other restrictions that prevent the prompt repatriation of aliens to any foreign state.

Visa Bonds. The Secretary of Treasury shall take all appropriate action, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, to establish a system to facilitate the administration of all bonds that the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may lawfully require to administer the provisions of the INA.\nSec. 15. Reestablishment of the VOICE Office and Addressing Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall direct the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to take all appropriate and lawful action to reestablish within ICE an office to provide proactive, timely, adequate, and professional services to victims of crimes committed by removable aliens, and those victims\u2019 family members. The Attorney General shall also ensure that the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3771 are followed in all Federal prosecutions involving crimes committed by removable aliens.\nSec. 16.

The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly take all appropriate action, consistent with law, to rescind the policy decisions of the previous administration that led to the increased or continued presence of illegal aliens in the United States, and align any and all departmental activities with the policies set out by this order and the immigration laws. Such action should include, but is not limited to:\n(a) ensuring that the parole authority under section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) is exercised on only a case-by-case basis in accordance with the plain language of the statute, and in all circumstances only when an individual alien demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from their particular continued presence in the United States arising from such parole;\n(b) ensuring that designations of Temporary Protected Status are consistent with the provisions of section 244 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1254a), and that such designations are appropriately limited in scope and made for only so long as may be necessary to fulfill the textual requirements of that statute; and\n(c) ensuring that employment authorization is provided in a manner consistent with section 274A of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1324a), and that employment authorization is not provided to any unauthorized alien in the United States.\nSec. 17. Sanctuary Jurisdictions. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, to the maximum extent possible under law, evaluate and undertake any lawful actions to ensure that so-called \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions, which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to Federal funds. Further, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall evaluate and undertake any other lawful actions, criminal or civil, that they deem warranted based on any such jurisdiction\u2019s practices that interfere with the enforcement of Federal law.\nSec. 18. Information Sharing. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly issue guidance to ensure maximum compliance by Department of Homeland Security personnel with the provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1373 and 8 U.S.C. 1644 and ensure that State and local governments are provided with the information necessary to fulfill law enforcement, citizenship, or immigration status verification requirements authorized by law; and\n(b) The Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to stop the trafficking and smuggling of alien children into the United States, including through the sharing of any information necessary to assist in the achievement of that objective.\nSec. 19. Funding Review. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall:\n(a) Immediately review and, if appropriate, audit all contracts, grants, or other agreements providing Federal funding to non-governmental organizations supporting or providing services, either directly or indirectly, to removable or illegal aliens, to ensure that such agreements conform to applicable law and are free of waste, fraud, and abuse, and that they do not promote or facilitate violations of our immigration laws;\n(b) Pause distribution of all further funds pursuant to such agreements pending the results of the review in subsection (a) of this section;\n(c) Terminate all such agreements determined to be in violation of law or to be sources of waste, fraud, or abuse and prohibit any such future agreements;\n(d) Coordinate with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to ensure that no funding for agreements described in subsection (c) of this section is included in any appropriations request for the Department of Justice or the Department of Homeland Security; and\n(e) Initiate clawback or recoupment procedures, if appropriate, for any agreements described in subsection (c) of this section.\nSec. 20. Denial of Public Benefits to Illegal Aliens. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall take all appropriate action to ensure that all agencies identify and stop the provision of any public benefits to any illegal alien not authorized to receive them under the provisions of the INA or other relevant statutory provisions.\nSec. 21. Hiring More Agents and Officers. Subject to available appropriations, the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, shall take all appropriate action to significantly increase the number of agents and officers available to perform the duties of immigration officers.\nSec. 22. Severability. It is the policy of the United States to enforce this order to the maximum extent possible to advance the interests of the United States. Accordingly:\n(a) If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby; and\n(b) If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid because of the failure to follow certain procedures, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements to conform with existing law and with any applicable court orders.\nSec. 23. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025."

Gavin Newsom, who called it an \"assault\" on Democracy and invoked \"authoritarian regimes\" who \"begin by targeting people who are least able to defend themselves.\"\nLos Angeles Mayor Mayor Bass has also been vocal about her opposition to the deployment of National Guard troops, calling it an unnecessary overreach.\nIn a statement Tuesday, she said the troops' removal \u201chappened because the people of Los Angeles stood united and stood strong. We organized peaceful protests, we came together at rallies, we took the Trump administration to court \u2014 all of this led to today\u2019s retreat.\"\nThe state sued over the mobilization, which state Attorney General Rob Bonta said was unlawful and infringed on the governor's role as commander-in-chief.\nAn appeals panel ruled against the state's challenge, writing in a decision last month that President Donald Trump \"exercised his statutory authority\" when he activated the troops.\nThe deployment marked the first time a president had federalized National Guard troops without a governor\u2019s permission since 1965.\nHalf of the troops will remain in the area, for now, along with the roughly 700 Marines who Hegseth deployed.\nThe troops are authorized to detain people who pose a threat to federal personnel or property, but only until police can arrest them. Military officials are not allowed to carry out arrests themselves."

This isn't military personnel driving through your neighborhood. This is a targeted, well-planned operation,\" Homan said.\nJust days after he won last month's presidential election, Trump tapped Homan to serve as border czar, one of the earliest key hires for his second administration. Homan is a former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A proponent of hard-line border policies, Homan supported the first Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy, which resulted in family separations at the southern border.\nTrump made immigration and the border a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, vowing mass deportations and frequently using degrading language toward migrants.\nNew York City has laws in place limiting how local agencies cooperate with federal deportation efforts. Adams cannot unilaterally rescind the city's sanctuary status; rather, the status is determined by the city council.\nBut the mayor said earlier this year that he supported a bill that would roll back parts of the city's sanctuary policies.\n\"I've stated this over and over again, long before this election, that this can't be a safe haven of violent individuals,\" Adams said during Thursday's press conference. \"You have a right, a privilege, to live in this country, and those who want to commit acts of violence, they are violating that privilege.\"\nThe city saw an influx of migrants in 2022 and 2023, prompting Adams to urge the federal government to provide additional assistance and funds.

      "text": "A federal judge Tuesday blunted the impact of one of President Donald Trump's executive orders on immigration, forbidding the White House from withholding federal funds from sanctuary cities \u2014 local governments that limit police cooperation with federal immigration authorities.\nFederal District Court Judge William Orrick issued a nationwide injunction in response to a lawsuit filed by San Francisco and nearby Santa Clara County. They argued that the president's January 25th executive order, declaring sanctuary cities ineligible to receive federal grants, was unconstitutional.\n\"The Constitution vests the spending power in Congress, not the President,\" the judge said. President Trump's executive order \"cannot constitutionally place new conditions on federal funds.\"\nSan Francisco's city attorney, Dennis Herrera, applauded the judge's order. \"This is why we have courts - to halt the overreach of a president and an attorney general who either don't understand the Constitution or chose to ignore it.\"\nRelated: San Francisco Seeks Ban on Trump \u2018Sanctuary Cities\u2019 Order\nThe Trump administration argued that the lawsuit was premature because the government hasn't yet taken steps to carry out the executive order. But the judge said the city and county were already feeling the effects of budget uncertainty caused by the administration's threat to withhold grants. Lawyers for San Francisco said the city could lose about $2 billion a year.\nTuesday's order covered a section of Mr. Trump's executive order titled \"Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States.\" The challenged provision directed the attorney general to ensure that sanctuary cities \"are not eligible to receive federal grants.\" It also directed the secretary of Homeland Security to designate local governments as sanctuary cities.\nAt the heart of the dispute are detainer requests, issued by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE, asking local police and sheriff's offices to hold jail inmates for up to 48 hours after they have completed serving their sentences. The requests apply to people in the US illegally who are convicted of committing local crimes and who are subject to deportation after they are released.\nCity ordinances prohibit San Francisco police from giving immigration authorities advance notice of an inmate's release from jail, even if the police know that ICE wants to detain that person.\nRelated: Conservative Cities See 'Sanctuary City' Term as Scarlet Letter\nJudge Orrick also said the executive order was unconstitutional because it imposed conditions on federal funds already issued or approved. And he said the president's action was too broad.\n\"Federal funding that bears no meaningful relationship to immigration enforcement cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the president disapproves,\" the judge wrote.\nSanta Clara Supervisor Cindy Chavez in a statement Tuesday said the Trump administration attempted an \"end run\" around the Constitution. Board of Supervisors President Dave Cortese said \u201cThe politics of fear emanating from the Trump White House has just suffered a major setback.\u201d\n\"The court\u2019s decision is a win for the neediest people in our nation. Seniors in need of food, foster youth in need of shelter and children who need medical care,\u201d Chavez said. \"We\u2019ll continue being a welcoming, safe and diverse community.\"\nTuesday's order does not completely forbid the federal government to withhold grant money from uncooperative cities. An existing federal law says local governments cannot restrict law enforcement officials from sending information to the federal government about the citizenship status of any person.\nThe judge said his injunction \"does not impact the government's ability to use lawful means to enforce existing conditions of federal grants,\" including obeying that law.\nIn a statement, the Justice Department said Tuesday's order upheld the government's ability to enforce existing conditions on federal grants and said it \"will follow the law with respect to regulation of sanctuary jurisdictions.\"\nWhite House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said Tuesday night that the administration plans to appeal. \"The idea that an agency can\u2019t put in some reasonable restrictions on how some of these monies are spent is something that will be overturned eventually,\" Priebus said. \"We'll win at the Supreme Court at some point.\"\nSimilar lawsuits are pending in Washington, Massachusetts, and elsewhere in California.\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement Tuesday that the judge\u2019s order is another defeat for the Trump administration\u2019s policies on immigration.\n\"Once again a federal court has told the Trump administration: 'No you can't.' The president is going beyond his authority when he tries to cut vital funding to cities that don\u2019t share his illogical and unconstitutional desire to scapegoat immigrants,\" de Blasio, a Democrat, said."

      "text": "The Trump administration sued the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago on Thursday, alleging that their sanctuary city policies are blocking federal authorities from enforcing immigration laws.\nThe federal lawsuit is the first by President Donald Trump's Justice Department against states or municipalities that have sanctuary city policies in effect.\nThe 22-page lawsuit, filed one day after a sanctuary jurisdiction directive was issued by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on her first day on the job, alleged that the sanctuary policies put in place by Illinois, Chicago and Cook County \u201cobstruct\u201d the federal government from enforcing immigration laws.\n\u201cThe challenged provisions of Illinois, Chicago, and Cook County law reflect their intentional effort to obstruct the Federal Government\u2019s enforcement of federal immigration law and to impede consultation and communication between federal, state, and local law enforcement officials that is necessary for federal officials to carry out federal immigration law and keep Americans safe,\u201d the lawsuit reads.\nThe suit is the latest vehicle to be used by the Trump administration as it quickly advances its mass deportation push of undocumented immigrants. It may also raise questions about the future enforcement of a directive issued days after the inauguration, when the Trump White House instructed the Justice Department to investigate state or local officials who resist the enforcement of federal immigration laws.\nSanctuary cities or states are not official terms. The labels refer to a state, city, county or municipality that has enacted laws that either explicitly or effectively prevent or limit local officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.\nThe lawsuit specifically references Illinois\u2019 \u201cTrust Act,\u201d Chicago\u2019s \u201cWelcoming City Ordinance\u201d and Cook County\u2019s \u201cPolicy for Responding to ICE Detainers.\u201d\nThe Illinois Trust Act, enacted in 2017, \u201cprevents state and local law enforcement from assisting the federal government with civil immigration enforcement but allows coordination when there is a federal criminal warrant,\u201d according to a fact sheet describing the law provided by the office of Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker.\nChicago\u2019s \u201cWelcoming City Ordinance\u201d and Cook County\u2019s policy essentially spell out that same mission.\nThe suit seeks both a temporary and permanent blockage on enforcement of all three of the policies.\nIn a statement to NBC News, Pritzker spokesperson Alex Gough said the state will fight the suit.\n\u201cThe bipartisan Illinois TRUST Act, signed into law by a Republican governor, has always been compliant with federal law and still is today. Illinois will defend our laws that prioritize police resources for fighting crime while enabling state law enforcement to assist with arresting violent criminals,\u201d Gough said. \u201cInstead of working with us to support law enforcement, the Trump Administration is making it more difficult to protect the public, just like they did when Trump pardoned the convicted January 6 violent criminals. We look forward to seeing them in court.\u201d\nJohnson said in a statement that the city's law department was reviewing the suit and would \"respond in due course.\"\n\"Chicago is and will remain a welcoming city, with welcoming people,\" Johnson said. \"The safety and security of Chicago residents remains the priority,\" he said, adding that Chicago \"will continue to protect the working people of our city and defend against attacks on our longstanding values.\"\nJohnson and other Chicago officials have remained fiercely defiant against Trump on immigration issues.\nIn the weeks following Trump\u2019s victory in November, Johnson, a Democrat, said the city \u201cwill not bend or break\u201d on its sanctuary laws.\nAnd last month, the Chicago City Council voted down a proposal that would have eased laws barring city officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities who are targeting individuals involved in violent crimes.\nTrump sparred with Chicago over the same issues during his first administration. The city was the site of one of the administration\u2019s first major enforcement actions after Trump was sworn in last month."

In 2020, after years of litigation, the Trump administration won the right to withhold funding from sanctuary cities, but was not in office for long after the ruling was issued.\nThere is no precedent for prosecuting state or local officials who are deemed to have resisted federal immigration enforcement.\nOne of the most notable directives instructs the FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country to coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security \u201cto assist in the execution of President Trump\u2019s immigration-related initiatives.\u201d That is a marked departure from past policy. Those task forces generally focus on terrorist threats, which officials say are at a higher level than they have been in recent years.\nThe memo orders the FBI, DEA, ATF, the U.S. Marshals and the Bureau of Prisons to \u201creview their files for identifying information and/or biometric data relating to non-citizens located illegally in the United States.\u201d\n\u201cThe Department of Justice will take all steps necessary to protect the public and secure the American border by removing illegal aliens from the country and prosecuting illegal aliens for crimes committed within U.S. jurisdiction,\u201d the memo says.\nIt orders the DOJ to pursue every possible immigration violation and coordinate with federal courts to handle \u201cthe increased number of prosecutions that will result.\u201d\nSome officials in sanctuary cities like Chicago, Denver and Minneapolis have said they intend to defend immigrants who are in their city without authorization.\nIn the days ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, a Democrat, said he would preserve the city\u2019s sanctuary city laws.\n\u201cIf Donald Trump tries to break the law and abuse his power, he will get no help from us,\u201d Johnston spokesperson Jordan Fuja said in a statement to NBC News, adding that the mayor is \u201cconsidering a number of options to strengthen protections for all our residents.\u201d"

      "text": "To former aides who worked in Barack Obama\u2019s White House, the Trump administration\u2019s allegations of \u201ctreason\u201d carried the stench of desperation from a president straining to shift the focus from a burgeoning scandal around Jeffrey Epstein.\nStill, they\u2019re grappling with how to contain the unprecedented accusations National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard has leveled, even as they dismiss them as asinine, interviews with more than half a dozen people who worked in Obama\u2019s White House or on his campaigns reveal.\nThese people say the events of the last week have turned into a messaging balancing act between unnecessarily giving oxygen to the claims that Obama ordered a false intelligence analysis to show Russia had worked to help Trump win the 2016 election and leaving the potential for unchecked accusations to balloon. Many of those who talked to NBC News were not authorized to speak publicly about strategy.\n\u201cThe battle now is to play this even to make sure that thoughts don\u2019t start to creep into more mainstream\u201d audiences, a former Obama administration official said. That person said it was important to reach \"mainstream Republicans,\" who would listen to editorial boards and those in Congress who deemed the allegations against Obama as \"beyond the pale.\"\nSome expressed uncertainty over what to expect next from Trump or his lieutenants, charging that the administration could grow more bullish to draw attention away from a string of explosive Epstein stories that Trump is struggling to tamp down. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but it has said there is merit to accusations around Obama.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what is ahead, and I don\u2019t know what their plans and intentions are,\u201d John Brennan, who was CIA director in the Obama administration, told NBC News. \u201cI just find all of this very troubling when it is being done by individuals who serve in such important positions and know what they are doing is wrong.\u201d\nFormer National Intelligence Director James Clapper echoed Brennan\u2019s ambiguity over the Trump administration\u2019s intentions, telling CNN he would \u201clawyer up.\u201d\nNational Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe leveled claims last week that Obama administration officials manipulated intelligence and conspired to undermine the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s electoral victory in 2016. Gabbard posted on social media last Friday that she was making a criminal referral to the Justice Department. Then, this week, she stepped up publicity around the accusations from the White House briefing room.\nBroadly, the former Obama aides unequivocally say that there is zero merit to the allegations and that they do not believe they will lead anywhere. They point to a 2020 Senate investigation, which endorsed intelligence agencies\u2019 assessment that Russia had spread disinformation online and leaked stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee to undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 candidacy and help Trump. Trump-appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio was the acting chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee at the time, which endorsed the findings.\n\u201cThere is no factual basis for the allegations that Tulsi Gabbard is making. She\u2019s cherry-picking things from various documents that are out of context and mischaracterized,\u201d Brennan said.\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s clear either she has not read the intelligence community assessment or she is purposely, willfully lying about the contents,\u201d he added.\nObama allies also say the timing of the allegations is suspect. They emerged as Trump has struggled to contend with his own base after his administration announced it would not release more documents tied to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who faced a litany of allegations of abuse of underage women before he died by suicide.\nOn Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal, owned by Rupert Murdoch, reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi told Trump in May that his name appears in the Epstein files \u2014 even though he told reporters this month that Bondi had not informed him that he was named.\nIn the midst of a firestorm Trump has yet to shake, the administration brought out the allegations against Obama. Over the weekend, Trump reposted a fake AI-generated video of Obama being arrested on social media.\nOnce Gabbard used the word \u201ctreason,\u201d Obama\u2019s team ramped up its messaging, leading Obama's spokesperson to release a carefully worded statement. It denounced Gabbard\u2019s accusations without mentioning Epstein, because it was \u201cbelow the dignity of the former president,\u201d a former Obama administration official said.\n\u201cOut of respect for the office of the presidency, our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this White House with a response,\u201d Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in a statement this week. \u201cBut these claims are outrageous enough to merit one. These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.\"\nNed Price, who held roles under Obama as a special assistant to the president, a National Security Council senior director and spokesperson and as a CIA senior analyst under Obama and George W. Bush, said he believed it was imperative to reach conservative audiences with a response. On Wednesday, he wrote an opinion piece for Fox News titled: \u201cAmericans should beware of Gabbard\u2019s \u2018dangerous distraction\u2019 with revisionist history of 2016 election.\u201d\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a piece I would have written for any mainstream or left-of-center outlet. This was designed solely and exclusively for Fox News, because that\u2019s where this fire of disinformation is raging,\u201d Price said in an interview. \u201cI thought it was important ... to inject facts into that very venue in the hope that at least a few people would read it and be exposed to what actually transpired in 2016.\u201d"

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order prohibiting \u201cthird party, pay-for-play\u201d payments to college athletes, a move the White House is taking to curb \u201cbidding wars\u201d that have roiled college sports in recent years.\nThe order, a fact sheet that was shared in advance with NBC News by a White House official, notes that recent court rulings have dismantled the NCAA\u2019s transfer and recruiting rules and \u201ccreated a chaotic environment that threatens the financial and structural viability of college athletics.\u201d\nThe order could send shockwaves through college football and men\u2019s basketball, where player recruitment in the so-called transfer portal has become a multimillion-dollar market in recent years, with top teams spending tens of millions to fill out rosters.\nThe order would not apply to fair-market compensation for athletes who make brand endorsements, according to the White House.\nThe order also looks to protect women\u2019s and nonrevenue sports by mandating that revenue sharing between universities and college athletes be implemented in a manner that protects those programs.\nThe president\u2019s order also notes that a patchwork of laws in 30 states have contributed to competitive imbalances in sports.\nIt was not immediately clear how the proposed order would be enforced, or what mechanisms were in place to ensure revenue is shared more equitably between men\u2019s and women\u2019s and nonrevenue-generating sports."

Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that these policies have led to the release of criminals who pose a threat to public safety. The lawsuit seeks to declare the city's laws invalid and prevent local officials from enforcing them, amidst ongoing tensions between the federal government and sanctuary jurisdictions across the country.",
