  "content": "Patrons of a new Peruvian restaurant in Pleasanton feel that the restaurant lives up to its name. \"I can't say enough good things about Bravazo! Their service and food always blows me away and I'm always super excited when I get the chance to eat here. There are so many good options here that it's hard to choose one thing,\" one reviewer said of the restaurant, which was located at Passion Pastry at 3500 Bernal Avenue for a while, but opened a new location at 428 Main Street on Wednesday.\n\n\"Bravazo is the culmination of a lifelong love for cooking and a deep connection to Peruvian flavors. From an early age, [founder Lucho Blanco] was inspired by his mother's exceptional culinary skills and began experimenting in the kitchen, creating dishes that delighted his family and friends. This early exposure to cooking ignited a passion that has only grown stronger over the years,\" the restaurant said on its website. In addition to their signature pan con chicharr\u00f3n and many varieties of empanadas, guests can enjoy Peruvian treats like chichi Morada, a purple corn drink infused with cinnamon, tuna salad sandwich, avocado toast, French toast, special Bravazo hot sauce available for purchase , and all varieties of coffee.\n\nThe new location is open 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. every day of the week except Tuesday.
