  "title": "Is There An Opportunity With Avolta AG's (VTX:AVOL) 36% Undervaluation?",
  "description": "Key Insights Avolta's estimated fair value is CHF72.06 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Avolta is estimated to...",
  "content": "\u2022 Avolta's estimated fair value is CHF72.06 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\u2022 Avolta is estimated to be 36% undervalued based on current share price of CHF46.04\n\u2022 Our fair value estimate is 46% higher than Avolta's analyst price target of CHF49.23 Does the August share price for Avolta AG (VTX:AVOL) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example! Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit. We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = CHF5.4b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 0.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.9%. Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= CHF12b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.9%)10= CHF5.0b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is CHF10b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of CHF46.0, the company appears quite good value at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Avolta as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. Check out our latest analysis for Avolta\n\u2022 Debt is well covered by cash flow.\n\u2022 Interest payments on debt are not well covered.\n\u2022 Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Specialty Retail market.\n\u2022 Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the Swiss market.\n\u2022 Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\u2022 Dividends are not covered by earnings.\n\u2022 Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year. Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Avolta, we've put together three further aspects you should explore:\n\u2022 Risks: For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Avolta (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\u2022 Future Earnings: How does AVOL's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market? Dig deeper into the analyst consensus number for the upcoming years by interacting with our free analyst growth expectation chart.\n\u2022 Other Solid Businesses: Low debt, high returns on equity and good past performance are fundamental to a strong business.

      "text": "Results\n22\nMidstream oil and gas companies, specifically pipeline operators, are well-positioned to benefit from Trump\u2019s executive orders on fossil fuels enacted in early 2025. \u2013 \u2013 These policies aim to accelerate infrastructure development by streamlining environmental reviews and permitting processes, such as those under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$310.9b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$155.55\n7D\n0.3%\n1Y\n6.7%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$69.9b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$57.80\n7D\n0.8%\n1Y\n29.4%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$59.0b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$26.82\n7D\n-0.1%\n1Y\n27.7%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$51.9b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$240.61\n7D\n3.4%\n1Y\n32.3%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$50.4b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$164.94\n7D\n1.6%\n1Y\n-4.0%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$46.4b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$74.02\n7D\n-1.0%\n1Y\n-15.4%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.4b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$103.24\n7D\n-0.5%\n1Y\n36.3%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.7b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$41.32\n7D\n-0.4%\n1Y\n12.9%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.4b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$17.71\n7D\n-2.7%\n1Y\n21.0%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.4b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$39.83\n7D\n-2.7%\n1Y\n-6.2%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$2.8b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$22.19\n7D\n-2.3%\n1Y\n-33.9%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.6b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$30.13\n7D\n6.8%\n1Y\n36.7%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.5b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$22.64\n7D\n7.8%\n1Y\n12.6%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$532.9m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$2.40\n7D\n5.3%\n1Y\n-21.8%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$397.1m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.28\n7D\n-2.1%\n1Y\n-39.2%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$236.1m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$20.03\n7D\n-0.3%\n1Y\n-44.9%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$78.3m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$4.21\n7D\n-4.3%\n1Y\n7.0%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$39.7m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$0.83\n7D\n-2.9%\n1Y\n-55.8%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$1.3m\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0025\n7D\n78.6%\n1Y\n-75.0%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a"
