  "title": "China's Chemicals Makers Reap Reward of Shift From Oil to Coal",
  "description": "Falling coal prices are shifting the profitability of China\u2019s chemicals sector, away from traditional oil-based producers to the growing number of plants that use t\u2026",
  "content": "China\u2019s biggest coal-to-chemicals producer, Ningxia Baofeng Energy Group Co., saw first-half profits surge 73%, while top miner China Shenhua Energy Co. reported a near 20-fold increase at its Inner Mongolia chemicals facility. Meanwhile, oil refining giant Sinopec lost 4.5 billion yuan ($630 million) at its chemicals unit over the first six months of the year, even worse than the 3.6 billion yuan it shed in the same period in 2024.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\nBut coal-based producers are still profitable at current chemicals prices, thanks to the price of their feedstock dropping to a four-year low. The industry is eyeing a 520-billion yuan expansion over the next five years, potentially increasing its capacity by a third.\n\nAs long as Chinese coal stays cheap, the reorientation of the sector could be hard to halt, not least because it comes with the additional benefit of cutting the country\u2019s dependence on foreign energy. China produces most of its own coal, and imports most of its oil. Indeed, the nation has a surfeit of coal that needs to find a home as renewables take an ever greater share of power generation.\n\nThe trade off that could give policymakers pause relates to decarbonization. Making chemicals from coal is even more polluting than using petroleum-based feedstocks. Beijing\u2019s goal of peaking emissions by the end of the decade is likely to have a sharper focus in the next five-year plan due early in 2026.\n\nThe coal-to-chemicals sector emitted 690 million tons of CO2 last year, as much as 440 million tons more than would have been released at traditional plants, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin appears to have secured a diplomatic win he has sought for years, with a massive pipeline deal that would tie Russia and China together for decades and could redefine the global gas trade. China\u2019s seaborne gas needs, meanwhile, could stall, according to BloombergNEF.\n\nIn almost every area of the energy transition, one country dominates: China. Wind power, where the People\u2019s Republic still has less than half the global market, is a rare exception. President Donald Trump is doing his best to change that.",

The shift is driven by coal feedstock prices hitting a four\u2011year low, enabling a projected 520\u2011billion\u2011yuan expansion that could raise capacity by a third over five years. However, the move raises decarbonization concerns, as coal\u2011based chemicals emit roughly 250\u202fmillion tonnes more CO\u2082 than petroleum\u2011based plants, potentially challenging China\u2019s 2030 emissions\u2011peaking goal.",
