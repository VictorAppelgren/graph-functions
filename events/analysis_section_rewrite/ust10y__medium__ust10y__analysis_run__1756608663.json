      "feedback": "The draft is on the right track but needs several hard edits to meet Argos standards:  \n\n1. **Add explicit canonical‑handle mapping and magnitude ranges** – e.g. “spx ↓ 5–10 %” (FAN5RYW6T), “fed_policy ↓ 0–2 bp” (FAN5RYW6T), “us_inflation ↑ 2.7 %” (FAN5RYW6T), “us_core_cpi ↑ 2.9 %” (FAN5RYW6T).  \n2. **Insert inline citations** after every substantive claim (use the article ID FAN5RYW6T).  \n3. **Define the catalyst window clearly** – “September 5 payrolls, September Fed meeting, Q3 earnings season (early Oct)”.  \n4. **Structure the scenario in the required format**:  \n   *Base case*: spx ↓ 5–10 % if any of the top 8 tech names miss earnings or Fed cuts rates.  \n   *Alt*: spx ↑ 2–5 % if earnings surprise or Fed pauses/hikes.  \n   *Risks*: Fed holds rates higher than expected (exacerbates tech valuation pressure); tariff‑driven inflation persists (weakens discretionary spending).  \n   *Watch‑list signals*: September 5 payrolls, Fed minutes, earnings releases of the top 8 constituents.  \n   *Confidence*: moderate (structural concentration risk + well‑defined catalyst window).  \n5. **Remove any generic statements** (“could trigger a sharp market pullback”) and replace with quantified language.  \n6. **Adhere to naming policy**: use “spx”, “fed_policy”, “us_inflation”, “us_core_cpi” (no underscores).  \n7. **Keep the paragraph concise** (≤ 200 words) and action‑oriented.  \n\nRe‑write the draft incorporating these edits to achieve a world‑class, defensible macro view.",
