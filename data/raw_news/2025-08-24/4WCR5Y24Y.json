      "text": "When is the Super Bowl?\n- Sunday, Feb. 9, at 6:30 p.m. ET (3:30 p.m. PT).\nWhere to watch the Super Bowl?\n- Super Bowl 2025 will air on Fox and stream for free on Tubi.\nThe Kansas City Chiefs have a chance to become the first team to win the Super Bowl three straight times. Standing in the way of a three-peat (and a fourth title in six years) are the Philadelphia Eagles, whom the Chiefs defeated two years ago for the first of their back-to-back titles.\nThe Eagles are looking for the second Super Bowl championship in the franchise's history after winning it seven years ago against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. This time around, Brady will be in the broadcast booth, calling the game for Fox.\nSuper Bowl LIX will take place in New Orleans tonight on Sunday, Feb. 9, and will be broadcast nationally on Fox. And, for the first time, you'll be able to watch the game on streaming service Tubi -- for free and in 4K. Keep reading to see the best ways to watch Super Bowl LIX on Fox or for free on Tubi.\nWhen is the Super Bowl?\nSuper Bowl 59 will take place on Feb. 9 at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. Kickoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET (3:30 p.m. PT) and will be broadcast nationally on Fox.\nRead more: Best TV of 2025\nWhich teams are playing in Super Bowl LIX?\nThe AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs and the NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles are playing in Super Bowl 59. It's a rematch of Super Bowl 57, which saw the Chiefs come back from a 10-point halftime deficit to edge the Eagles 38-35 with a field goal in the closing seconds.\nHow to watch the Super Bowl without cable\nYou don't need a cable or satellite TV subscription to watch the big game. You can use a live TV streaming service to watch the Super Bowl on Fox, and you can also watch for free on Tubi. Unlike in past years when Fox had the Super Bowl, you will not be able to use the Fox Sports app to stream the Super Bowl.\nHow to watch Super Bowl 59 on Tubi\nIn addition to watching the game on Fox, you can also stream the Fox broadcast for free -- and in 4K -- on Tubi. The Fox-owned free streaming service will show the game and halftime show, as well as a lengthy pregame show.\nYou may have streamed a movie for free on Tubi before, agreeing to sit through a few ad breaks to avoid paying to rent or buy the movie. Now you can use the ad-supported streaming service to watch the Super Bowl. Tubi will offer a livestream of the Fox broadcast for Super Bowl LIX, including the pregame, halftime and postgame shows in addition to the full game itself.\nTubi's live Super Bowl coverage will begin at 3:30 p.m. ET (12:30 p.m. PT) with a pregame red carpet event hosted by Olivia Culpo.\nTubi does not require you to create an account to watch a movie or TV show, but it will require you to sign up for a free account with an email address to watch the Super Bowl.\nHow to watch Super Bowl 59 in 4K\nFox will broadcast the Super Bowl in 4K, assuming you have the proper setup. To get the game in its best resolution, you'll need to either use Tubi, have service from a company that offers 4K broadcasts (DirecTV, Dish, Comcast, Optimum and Verizon Fios are some traditional cable/satellite companies that offer 4K) or a 4K-capable plan on a streaming service. Four of the five major live TV streaming services will stream the game in 4K -- all but Hulu Plus Live TV.\nIf you want a new TV for the Super Bowl, check out our recommendations for the best TVs we've tested as well as the best TV deals and best 4K TV deals happening right now. If you're set with your TV but want to improve your living-room audio to hear every tackle (and commercial) during the game, check out the best soundbars.\nHow to watch Super Bowl 59 on Fox\nYou can watch the game on your local Fox station with a cable or satellite TV subscription or with an over-the-air antenna. Most live TV streaming services such as YouTube TV and Hulu Plus Live TV also carry your local Fox station (see below).\nYou can also subscribe to NFL Plus, the NFL's own streaming service at $7 per month, but those streams are limited to just watching on a phone or tablet (not a TV).\nYouTube TV costs $83 a month after a recent price hike and includes Fox. Right now, the first six months are discounted to $70 a month. You'll need the $10-a-month 4K Plus add-on to watch the Super Bowl in 4K. Plug in your ZIP code on YouTube TV's welcome page to see which local networks are available in your area.\nIf you plan to use YouTube TV to watch the game, you might want to change this setting to decrease the broadcast delay and stay closer to the action in real time.\nFubo's Essential plan costs $85 a month after a recent price hike and includes Fox. To watch the game in 4K, you'll need to spring for the $95-a-month Elite plan. Click here to see which local channels you get. Read our Fubo review.\nHow to watch the Super Bowl with a VPN\nIf no convenient opportunities exist to watch the game where you live, then using a VPN with US-based server should provide access to some or all of the streaming options listed above. With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, non-blackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, are very easy to use.\nUsing a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US and Canada, as long as you've got a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.\nWhat are my Super Bowl viewing options outside the US?\nInternational viewers should check their local listings to determine the best local option to watch or stream the Super Bowl. You could also see if DAZN's NFL Game Pass service is available where you live. It's a low-cost subscription streaming service that's available internationally.\nHow to watch the Super Bowl in the UK\nIn the UK, the game will be broadcast on ITV and Sky Sports.\nHow to watch the Super Bowl in Germany\nIn Germany, the game will be shown on RTL and streamed live on RTL Plus.\nHow to watch the Super Bowl in Australia\nIn Australia, you can watch the game on Channel 7 and 7mate.\nHow to watch the Super Bowl in Canada\nIn Canada, you will be able to watch the broadcast on CTV or TSN, depending on your location, or the French-language broadcast on RDS.\nExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100 you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month.\nNote that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nLooking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now and the best VPN's we've tested.\nOther options for watching the Super Bowl in 4K in the US\nIf Sling TV carries Fox in your area, then it's the cheapest way to watch the Super Bowl with a live TV streaming service. DirecTV Stream, in contrast, is the most expensive live TV streaming service but also has the most RSNs for watching other sports.\nSling TV Blue costs $46 a month and includes Fox but only in select markets. It does not charge extra for 4K streaming. Read our Sling TV review.\nDirecTV Stream's basic $87-a-month package includes Fox in most markets. It does not charge extra for 4K streaming. You can use its channel lookup tool to see which local channels are available where you live. Read our DirecTV Stream review.\nAll the live TV streaming services above allow you to cancel anytime and require a solid internet connection. Looking for more information? Check out our live TV streaming services guide.\nHow much are Super Bowl tickets?\nIn the lead-up to the game, ticket prices are dropping but still probably more than you want to spend unless you're the most passionate supporter of the Chiefs or Eagles. As of Thursday, the cheapest tickets are going for roughly $2,600 per ticket on StubHub.\nWho's singing the national anthem?\nNew Orleans native and five-time Grammy Award winner Jon Batiste will sing the national anthem.\nWho's performing in the Super Bowl halftime show?\nKendrick Lamar will headline the Super Bowl halftime show with special guest SZA. You can expect to hear the duo perform Luther and Gloria, two songs from Lamar's latest album, GNX, that feature SZA, and perhaps their Oscar-nominated song All the Stars from the Black Panther movie. Less likely to be included in the Super Bowl set is Not Like Us, Lamar's diss track aimed at Drake.\nThis will mark Lamar's second time on the Super Bowl stage. He performed at the Super Bowl halftime show three years ago with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent and Anderson .Paak.\nWho's calling the game?\nFox's lead team of Kevin Burkhardt and Tom Brady will call the game alongside sideline reporters Erin Andrews and Tom Rinaldi. Brady played in 10 Super Bowls, winning a record seven titles, but this will be his first time announcing the game."

      "text": "Sports fans may already be playing the New York Times' Connections: Sports Edition daily puzzle, which the newspaper has been offering in beta since September. But on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 9, the game is moving out of beta. The Connections: Sports Edition puzzle that day will be Super Bowl-themed, as a tribute to that day's game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.\nBut don't look for Connections: Sports Edition in the New York Times Games app. Instead, it will appear in The Athletic app in both the iOS App Store and Google Play, for Android devices. That's because the game is a partnership between the Times and The Athletic, its subscription-based sports journalism site. Puzzles are written by The Athletic's managing editor for news, Mark Cooper.\nConnections: Sports Edition also will remain available on The Athletic's site for anyone to play without a subscription.\nCNET posts daily hints and answers for Connections: Sports Edition, regular Connections, Wordle, Strands and the NYT Mini Crossword.\nRead more: How to Watch the Super Bowl Without Cable\nConnections: Sports Edition is like the newspaper's popular online game Connections, where you look at a grid with 16 words and try to match them up into four categories. But you'd better know at least a little about a wide variety of sports to play Connections: Sports Edition. All the words are sports related, and the categories range from general terms about sports to superspecific trivia, such as \"rookie quarterbacks to reach the conference championship\" in the NFL.\nLike regular Connections, Connections: Sports Edition loves to play with words, so you might find four words that all have \"Super\" as a prefix, or \"Block\" as a suffix. And the editors lean heavy on \"teams that are all from this certain city,\" or \"colleges that are all in this certain conference,\" or \"teams in various sports and cities that share a mascot.\" So it helps if your sports knowledge isn't limited to your own home city, state or conference.\nRead more: Super Bowl 2025: How to Watch the Halftime Show With Megastar Kendrick Lamar\nAnd since the Times is a US newspaper, this is a puzzle heavily slanted towards American sports, although occasionally a category about the English Premier League or an international tennis tournament makes it through. The puzzle also occasionally throws team logos or athlete photos into the puzzle, so you need to have some visual knowledge of sports as well.\nRead more: NYT Connections: Sports Edition Delivers a Real Challenge, Even to Sports Fans\nYour skill at Connections: Sports Edition depends on your knowledge of the sports being included that day, but here are three of the categories I've found especially tough in recent days.\nNo. 1: Homophones of NBA player names, Jan. 26. Answers: Barns, Connect, Heart and Hero.\nNo. 2: WNBA MVPs, Jan. 21. Answers: Catchings, Delle Donne, Fowles and Stewart.\nNo. 3: Premier League team nicknames, Jan. 17. Answers: Bees, Cherries, Foxes and Hammers."

      "text": "How about that Wordle puzzle on May 29? The five-letter answer in the New York Times' engaging online word-guessing game probably shattered a few winning streaks, since it begins with the absolute rarest letter in the English language. I never guess that letter except out of total and complete desperation. Personally, I like to stick with starter words that I know feature some of the most frequently used letters. (TRAIN and CLOSE are among my favorites.)\nClick here for today's Wordle hints, as well as our daily answers and hints for The New York Times Mini Crossword, Connections, Connections: Sports Edition and Strands puzzles.\nIn order to get the absolute best starter words, you should know which letters turn up the most in English. I reached out to the big brains at the Oxford English Dictionary -- you know, the whopping, multi-volume dictionary that no one actually owns, but that your school librarian adored. An OED representative sent me a list in which staff analyzed all of the main entries in the concise version of the dictionary.\n\"It's worth noting that the piece is pretty old,\" the OED representative said apologetically. \"It mentions that the stats are from Concise Oxford English Dictionary in 2004, although current colleagues aren't sure when the piece itself was written, and I'm afraid we don't have any newer analysis of this sort.\"\nThe list may be 20 years old, but I'm going with it. The alphabet isn't like ice cream flavors or musical acts -- no new, trendy letters have been introduced in that time. So whether you're just getting into Wordle, or you want to shake up your starter words and make sure they're still hitting the most common letters, this list is for you.\nS begins the most English words\nThe most common letter is no surprise to most people: It's E, and it's immediately followed by another vowel, A. And those letters are much, much more popular than the final two letters in the OED's list, which are J and Q. (Anyone else surprised that J is used less than X and Z?)\n\"The letter E is over 56 times more common than Q in forming individual English words,\" the OED analysis found.\nIt notes that \"there are more English words beginning with the letter S than with any other letter.\"\nSo Wordle players, bookmark this article, and you might find yourself doing a little better in upcoming games. Here are the letters of the alphabet ranked according to how frequently they showed up in the 2004 Concise Oxford English Dictionary.\nThe most common letters used in English\nE\nA\nR\nI\nO\nT\nN\nS\nL\nC\nU\nD\nP\nM\nH\nG\nB\nF\nY\nW\nK\nV\nX\nZ\nJ\nQ"

The same day the NFL championship, Super\u202fBowl\u202f59, pits the Kansas\u202fCity\u202fChiefs against the Philadelphia\u202fEagles, with the game airing on Fox and a free 4K stream on Tubi. Viewers can also watch via various live\u2011TV streaming services, and the broadcast will feature the national anthem by Jon\u202fBatiste and a halftime show headlined by Kendrick\u202fLamar. Ticket prices are dropping but remain high, and the article also notes how to watch the game abroad and through VPNs.",
