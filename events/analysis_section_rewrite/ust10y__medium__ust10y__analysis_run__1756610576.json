      "feedback": "The draft is too vague and does not satisfy the Argos criteria. It mentions the S&P 500 but never maps to a canonical handle (e.g., spx, ust10y, dxy, gold, etc.) with a clear sign and magnitude range. It also fails to anchor every claim to a specific source ID (e.g., FAN5RYW6T, KX6AOMQZ5) and to provide a dated catalyst window. The analysis drifts from the required 3‑6‑month horizon by not specifying a concrete trigger date (e.g., September 5 payrolls, September FOMC meeting) and by not quantifying the impact on the index (e.g., ‑3 % to ‑8 % or +3 % to +7 %). It also omits key macro drivers that must be mapped: us_inflation (CPI 2.7 %), us_core_cpi (2.9 %), us_pce (2.9 %), fed_policy (September cut), us_labor_market (weak growth May‑July). Additionally, it does not list any invalidation scenarios (e.g., Fed holds rates, inflation spikes, tariff escalation). To meet the standard, rewrite the scenario as: “Base case: spx falls 4 % over 3‑6 months driven by a 40 % concentration in top‑10 tech names, weak us_labor_market (jobs growth 0.2 % q/q), sticky us_inflation (CPI 2.7 %) and us_core_cpi (2.9 %) that keep fed_policy at 5.25 % until September. Catalyst: September FOMC meeting on 2025‑09‑20; if Fed cuts to 4.75 % (fed_policy‑cut), spx gains 3‑5 % (spx‑up 3‑5 %) and us_dxy falls 2‑4 %. Invalidation: Fed holds rates, inflation rises to 3.2 %, or tariff‑driven price pressures increase corporate costs, pushing spx down an additional 2‑4 %. Include explicit source IDs for each data point and map each driver to a canonical handle with sign/magnitude. This will satisfy the truth‑>verbosity, market‑mapped, action‑over‑prose, and pillar‑diversification requirements.",
