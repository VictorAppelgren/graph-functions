Lesley is based in Los Angeles.\nLesley has assisted in the recovery of billions of dollars on behalf of aggrieved investors, including the victims of the Bernard M. Madoff bankruptcy. Courts throughout the United States have appointed him as Lead Counsel to represent investors in securities fraud class actions.\nGet Informed\nA class action is a type of lawsuit in which one person, usually the lead or named plaintiff, represents everyone who suffered similar harm from the defendant\u2019s unlawful conduct. Class action lawsuits are often filed when it would be impractical or prohibitively expensive for each person who was harmed to file an individual lawsuit. This procedural device enables shareholders or consumers who have suffered relatively small losses or injury to seek recovery from large corporations possessing much greater legal and financial resources without having to bear the financial risk.\nIn federal court, a \u201clead plaintiff\u201d will be appointed to represent the other shareholders who purchased the securities during the \u201cclass period,\u201d which is the time frame during which the fraud occurred. While class action lawsuits can take two to three years to litigate, they may also settle much sooner.\nSecurities class actions are lawsuits filed by at least one investor seeking to recover losses caused by corporate fraud and malfeasance. Securities class actions typically allege that a corporation through its officers and directors misled investors over a certain period of time, the \u201cClass Perios.\u201d\nClass actions typically take at least 2-3 years to litigate, although the actual time it takes to resolve a case varies, depending on the complexity of the case, the issues involved and other factors.\nUnder the direction of the federal securities laws, Courts appoint a lead plaintiff to direct legal counsel and represent the interests of the class of investors harmed by the alleged corporate wrongdoing.\nIf you purchased your securities during the class period, and your purchase resulted in a loss, you may be eligible to recover money damages.\nYes, investors can participate in the class action after selling shares, so long as the shares were purchased during the Class Period.\nNo. The Portnoy Law Firm will advance all costs of your class action lawsuit. Operating on a contingency basis, clients do not pay out of pocket, and the firm only recovers its expenses upon recovering money for clients.\nPotentially, other investors may file another case, in the event more than one class action filed, the court typically consolidates the cases into one single cases. The lead case will incorporate all the potential claims and parties."
