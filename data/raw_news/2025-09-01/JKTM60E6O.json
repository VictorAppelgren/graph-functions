  "content": "\u266a > > THIS IS THE ASIA TRADE. AVRIL: YOUR TOP STORIES: ASIAN MARKETS ARE CAUTIOUS FOLLOWING A U.S. COURT RULING TRUMP'S TARIFFS ILLEGA. POLITICAL UPHEAVAL IN THAILAND AND INDONESIA, FORCING THE PRESIDENT TO CANCEL A VISIT TO CHINA. > > THE SCO GETS UNDERWAY WITH WORLD LEADERS IN ATTENDANCE. XI JINPING AND PRIME MINISTER MODI OF INDIA WILL REBUILD TIES AMID THE U.S. TARIFF WAR. HOST: NIKKEI STOCKS HAVE RISEN IN THE PREVIOUS WEEK BUT RIGHT NOW FUTURES ARE GAINING 3/10 OF 1%. JAPANESE YEN LAST MONTH SAW GAINS AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR AND WE ARE WATCHING ECONOMIC DATA FROM JAPAN LIKE CAPEX NUMBERS AND FOLLOWING SOME DEFENSE STOCKS BECAUSE THE MINISTRY CAME OUT WITH A RECORD BUDGET FOR NEXT YEAR AND WE ARE WATCHING AUSTRALIAN PMI RISING TO THE HIGHEST SINCE 2022 WITH FACTORY OUTPUT IN CHINA AND CONTRACTIONARY TERRITORY. U.S. FUTURES ARE SETTING UP FOR A FOURTH CONSECUTIVE MONTH OF GAINS FOR THE S & P, DESPITE DOWNSIDE ON FRIDAY WITH A SELLOFF IN TECH. THE BIGGEST DATA WILL BE NONFARM PAYROLLS, A PRINT OF 75,000 JOBS FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST. AVRIL: YEAH, GEOPOLITICS IS IN THE BACKDROP AND WE HAD THE CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING AND INDIA'S MODI PLEDGING TO REBUILD TIES AMID PRESSURES FROM THE U.S. TRADE WAR, MEETING AT THE SHANGHAI SUMMIT. STEPHEN IS AT THE EVENT AND JOINS US NOW. WHAT IS YOUR SENSE ON THE DISAGREEMENTS AND ISSUES? CAN THEY REBUILD TIES AND CAN THE ELEPHANT IN THE DRAGON DANCE TOGETHER? STEPHEN: THAT IS WHAT CHINA WANTS. THE SCO HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE 2001, BUT THIS WILL BE THE BIGGEST ONE WITH MORE THAN 20 WORLD LEADERS . THE CHINA AND RUSSIA DYNAMIC WILL BUILD ON STRENGTHS. WEHT -- WHETHER WE GET OIL OR ENERGY DEALS IS YET TO BE SEEN, CHINA IS COURTING INDIA AND INDIA IS THE BIG FISH TO CATCH, LONG KNOWN FOR STRATEGIC AUTONOMY. THEY DON'T HAVE TREATIES, THEY ARE PART OF THE QUAD AND BRICS AND THEY LIKE THEIR AUTONOMY. SO THE COURTING ON MODI IS ONGOING AND MODI ANNOUNCED RESUMED FLIGHTS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, NOT A HUGE NEWS-WORTHY EVENT, BUT AGAINST THE U.S. PRESSURE ON INDIA BECAUSE OF THE PURCHASING OF RUSSIAN OIL IS OFFERING XI JINPING A GIFT AT THE SCO. SHERY: CHINA'S MILITARY PARADE, WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING? > > ABOUT 26 WORLD LEADERS, BUT MODI WILL NOT ATTEND. BUT KIM JONG UN AND PUTIN, AS WELL AS OTHERS. ONE LEADER NOT THERE IS FROM INDONESIA BECAUSE OF THE UNREST IN JAKARTA'S STREETS, BUT INTERESTINGLY, THE LEADER OF TURKEY, EGYPT, MALAYSIA AND OTHERS AS XI TRIES TO PORTRAY MILITARY MIGHT MODERNIZED IN CHINA. ALL THE LATEST MILITARY TECH FROM DRONES TO MISSILES, TO JET FIGHTERS ON WEDNESDAY. AVRIL: THANK YOU, STEPHEN ENGLE. AS STEVE TALKED ABOUT, THE INDONESIAN PRESIDENT IS CALLING FOR CALM. THERE WAS PUBLIC OUTRAGE ABOUT RISING LIVING COSTS. WHAT TRIGGERED THE PROTESTS? > > YES, THE FLASHPOINT WAS THE PERKS FOR LAWMAKERS AND PEOPLE ARE SEEING A SLOWING ECONOMY. THIS IS RUBBING SALT ON THE WOUNDS BY DEMANDING FOR HIGHER ALLOWANCES, THESE FRUSTRATIONS HAVE BUILT OVER THE LAST MONTHS WITH FACTORIES CLOSING DOWN AND LAWMAKERS SEEN AS POLITICAL ELITES WHO ARE OUT OF TOUCH. SHERY: THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN IN POWER FOR LESS THAN ONE YEAR, HOW IS HE TRYING TO APPEASE THE PUBLIC? > > THE PRESIDENT SAID THEY ARE SCRAPPING THE PERKS AND PARLIAMENT NEEDS TO BE IN TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE. THEY ARE TRYING TO CALM THE GROUND AND IT HAS BEEN A TUMULTOUS REIGN WITH MASSIVE PROTESTS, THEN MARKETS PLUNGED IN MARCH BECAUSE OF EXPENSIVE POLICIES, SO COMPANIES ARE INSTITUTING WORK FROM HOME MEASURS BECAUSE PROTESTS COULD OCCUR. AVRIL: HOW MUCH WORSE MIGHT IT GET FOR THE PRESIDENT AND WHAT IS THE WAY FORWARD? > > THE PROTESTS SHOW PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH THE LACK OF STABLE SALARIES AND IT'S A WAKE UP CALL FOR ELITES THAT PEOPLE ARE WATCHING. DISPLAY OF EXCESSIVE LIFESTYLE WOULD TRIGGER MORE PROTESTS AND THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WILL TAKE ACTION IF THERE IS MORE ANARCHY ON THE STREETS. SHERY: INDONESIA'S INFLATION HAS STABILIZED FOR AUGUST. WHAT ARE WE SEEING FROM THE BROADER ECONOMY? WHAT CAN THE CENTRAL BANK DO? > > THE CENTRAL BANK IS INTERVENING AND WE HAVE SEEN WEAKER CONSUMPTION POINTING TO PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO GET JOBS. YOU ARE SEEING PEOPLE NOT GETTING STABLE SALARIES AND THEY CANNOT CONTRIBUTE. ON TOP OF THE LACK OF POLICY CLARITY, THEY HAVE TO CONTEND WITH THE HEADWINDS FROM TARIFFS, SO THEY ARE DIGGING IN THEIR HEELS AND EXECUTING POLICIES, BUT THEY WILL INTERVENE WHEN NEEDED AND ADJUST POLICIES. AVRIL: THANK YOU. BLOOMBERG SOUTH EAST ASIA BUSINESS REPORTER. TURNING TO THAILAND, POLITICAL JOSTLING IS INTENSIFYING. . SO THE PEOPLE'S PARTY IS THE BIGGEST GROUP IN PARLIAMENT, IN POLE POSITION TO ANOINT THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER. WE WILL HAVE ANALYSIS ON THESE UPHEAVALS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE'S ASIA INSTITUTE JOINING US. SHERY: TRUMPS TARIFFS WERE DECLARED ILLEGAL UNDER AN EMERGENCY LAW. SENIOR EDITOR WENDY, WERE TALKING ABOUT 10% TARIFFS AS A BASELINE SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, WHAT HAPPENS TO GLOBAL TRADE? WENDY: NOTHING YET, THE RULING SAID THEY WERE UNCONSTITUTIONAL , THE U.S. DID THIS AFTER THE STOCK MARKET CRASH. SO A LOWER COURT REVIEWED THESE TARIFFS AND THE WHITE HOUSE IS APPEALING TO THE SUPREME WORD. THIS IS MAKING PLANNING DIFFICULT BECAUSE A COURT COULD RULE AT ANY MOMENT SO HOW LONG THE STATE OF PLAY REMAINS, WE HAVE NO IDEA. AVRIL: MORE... STATE OF LIMBO. WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF WHAT OPTIONS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MAY HAVE IF THE TARIFFS ARE DEEMED ILLEGAL? WENDY: IF THEY ARE DEEMED ILLEGAL, THEY ARE IN AN AWKWARD POSITION BECAUSE THIS IS HOW TRUMP SAID HE WOULD PAY FOR THE ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT BILL? THAT COST 3.4 TRILLION DOLLARS AN TARIFFS -- AND TARIFFS WERE SUPPOSED TO BRING IN REVENUE BECAUSE THE WEALTHY ARE GETTING TAX CUTS. HE SLASHED FOREIGN SPENDING AND AID, SO TAX CUTS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE PAID WITH TARIFF REVENUE OR DEBT WILL SOAR. SHERY: WENDY WITH THE ALATEST. MORE AHEAD, THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a AVRIL: TAKING A LOOK AT THE WEEK AHEAD, SOUTH KOREA'S TRADE DATA LOOKS WEAKER. ON WEDNESDAY CHINA WILL MARK THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE END OF WORLD WAR II. LEADERS ATTENDING INCLUDE KIM JONG-UN AND VLADIMIR PUTIN. AUSTRALIA'S SECOND-QUARTER GDP IS DUE ON THURSDAY, THE ECONOMY LIGHTLY PICKED UP ON FURTHER HOUSEHOLD SPENDING AND CONSTRUCTION. A U.S. JOBS REPORT MAY VALIDATE THE FED RESUMING POLICY EASING, THAT'S YOUR WEEK AHEAD. OVER THE WEEKEND WE GOT CHINA FACTORY DATA STUCK IN CONTRACTION AS THE GOVERNMENT CRACKED DOWN ON PRICE WARS. HOME PRICES DECLINED AND FRESH STIMULUS FROM BEIJING AND SHANGHAI WAS RULED OUT. ILIANA JANE IS INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIST. LET'S START WITH CHINA, ARE YOU SEEING A BOTTOM ON CHINA FACTORY ACTIVITY OR ARE WE JUST GETTING STARTED BECAUSE OF THE PRICE WARS? > > CERTAINLY THE PMI'S CAME OUT, WE SAW INCREASING PRICES AND ACTIVITY GOING AHEAD, IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT PMI FIGURES ARE WEEK COMPARED TO 10 YEAR TIME BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. THERE ARE RISKS GOING AHEAD. AVRIL: WHAT ABOUT COUNTRIES SUCH AS INDONESIA? WE ARE EXPECTING PMI NUMBERS LATER THIS MORNING AND THE MOOD IS PESSIMISTIC. DOES THIS COMPOUNDS THE RISK FOR INDONESIA? > > CERTAINLY FOR INDONESIA THERE ARE FACTORS EXTERNALLY AND DOMESTICALLY HAMPERING GROWTH LIKE TARIFFS AND DEMAND FOR MANUFACTURED GOODS OUT OF INDONESIA AND WITH THE PROTESTS, DOMESTIC PICTURE IS SHAKY. WE WILL SEE THE CONSUMER IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY. THEY ARE HESITANT TO SPEND MORE. SHERY: IS THAT THE MOOD FROM SOUTHEAST ASIA/ WE'VE SEEN HOW MUCH THEY HAVE ALL BEEN HIT BY TARIFFS. > > POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN ASIA HAS BEEN MARKED THIS YEAR, IMPACTING ASSET PRICES AND CONFIDENCE. BIG RISK EVENTS ONLY MAKE GROWTH WORSE AND COMPOUND TARIFFS MOVES. SHERY: KOREA EXPORT NUMBERS, JAPAN CAPEX DATA AS WELL. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING AS ECONOMIC GROWTH DRIVERS/ > > HOW QUICKLY THEY TRADE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND DIVERT TRADE FLOWS AS WE SEE ACTIVITY FROM ASIA TO EUROPE INCREASE. TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THAT PICK UP THE SLACK LOST TO THE U.S.? WE ARE SEEING TRADE PACTS IN ASIA, LIKE JAPAN AND INDIA MEETING. THROUGH COOPERATION, THEY MAY OFFSET TARIFFS. AVRIL: HOW ARE YOU READING THIS TARIFFS COURT LOSS FOR TRUMP? > > FOR TRADING, UM, FOR TRADING NATIONS, NOT TOO MUCH SO FAR. THE EXPORT NUMBERS HAVE BEEN STRONG AND THESE COUNTRIES ARE CHANGING THE WAY THEY EXPORT. IN JAPAN, AUTO NUMBERS DECLINED, BUT THAT WAS HEAVY DISCOUNTING TO CIRCUMVENT TARIFFS IN EXPORTING INTERMEDIATE GOODS OR DISCOUNTING GOODS BEFORE EXPORT. SO WE WILL SEE HOW TARIFFS CHANGE TRADE BETWEEN ASIA AND THE U.S. IT'S HARD TO SEE VALUES DECLINE, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE U.S. TRADES WITH ASIA WHILE THEY BUILD UP THEIR OWN DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES, SO WE WILL SEE DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING AROUND THAT. SHERY: MORE AHEAD ON THE ASIA TRADE. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a > > TAKE A LOOK AT U.S. FUTURES AFTER FRIDAY DOWNSIDE. FOUR MONTHS OF GAINS FOR THE S & P WITH THE USD STEADY. IN U.S. STOCKS, SEPTEMBER IS USUALLY THE WEAKEST MONTH, THE S & P FALLS 56% OF THE TIME WITH SLOWER BUYING. THE VIX IS 20% BELOW THE ONE YEAR AND TREASURY YIELDS CONTINUE TO FALL. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT FUTURES WITH SYDNEY POINTING TO SOME LOSSES AND NIKKEI DECLINES WITH MARKETS NEEDING TO KNOW THERE IS STABILITY AND THAT THE FED WILL EASE. THE NEXT FEW WEEKS GIVE WALL STREET A CLEAR READING ON WHETHER THE STOCK MARKEY RALLY WILL CONTINUE AND LET'S BRING IN GARFIELD REYNOLDS. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING BETWEEN NOW AND THE FED? > > THE JOBS DATER -- DATA IS THE BIGGEST ONE. THE SHOCKING DOWNWARD REVISIONS AND POTENTIAL FOR A SEPTEMBER FED CUT WAS LOW, DESPITE BETS IT COULD OCCUR. THE POOR LABOR MARKET READING GETS THE FED'S ATTENTION, IN PARTICULR -- PARTICULAR FROM POWELL AT JACKSON HOLE, IT CAME AS A SHOCK TO HIM. UNLESS WE GET A FLIP-FLOP, IT'S HARD TO SEE THE FED NOT CUTTING RATES, BUT DO THEY CUT ONCE AND HOLD OR COMMIT TO CUTTING SEVERAL TIMES? THE -- LATTER OPTION IS WHAT TARIFFS -- TREASURIES EXPECT, BUT WILL IT LOOK SO BAD THAT THE FED IS TOO LATE TO MOVE? SHERY: SO THE POSSIBLE RATE CUT LEADING TO A RALLY IN THE U.S. AND EM'S, COULD WE SEE DOWNSIDE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA? > > YEAH, THOSE ARE OMINOUS CLOUDS OVER SOUTHEAST ASIA, A REMINDER THAT THE REASON FOR CHEAPER VALUATIONS IS POTENTIAL FOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. NOT TOO MUCH OVER THE WEEKEND WOULD INDICATE DIPBUYERS AND INTERESTING TO SEE HOW MUCH THE BANK OF INDONESIA NEEDS TO INTERVENE TO KEEP THE RUPIA STABLE. AS YOU SAID, ASIAN MARKETS HAVE DONE WELL, BACK FROM THE TARIFFS SHOCKS. THE COURT CASE ON FRIDAY STATES WHETHER TARIFFS STAY IN PLACE? WHAT WILL TRUMP DO IF THEY GET OVERTURNED? ALL OF THAT REMINDS US OF RISK, EVEN WITH A FED RATE CUT. WATCHING JAPAN. AND WHAT GOES ON WITH DATA THERE AND WHETHER IT BUILDS TO A BOJ RATE HIKE AND YEN STRENGTH, WHICH CAN CREATE UNEXPECTED OUTCOMES. SHERY: GARFIELD REYNOLDS IN ASIA. SURROUNDING THE FED, WHETHER TRUMP COULD OUST LISA COOK, WHO SUED TRUMP OVER ALLEGATIONS OF MORTGAGE FRUAD. WE SPOKE TO ESTHER GEORGE ON FED INDEPENDENCE. > > THIS IS ANOTHER ATTACK ON THE INSTITUTION. HOWEVER THIS PLAYS OUT IN TERMS OF DETAILS OF THIS CASE, WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR THE PUBLIC IS TO UNDERSTAND WHO WILL INFLUENCE DECISIONS THAT THE FED MAKES. > > PERSONNEL DETERMINES POLICY AND THE CONCERN IS THE PRESIDENT WILL TARGET RENEWAL OF APPOINTMENTS OF REGIONAL FED PRESIDENTS IN FEBRUARY. HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU? ESTHER: VERY CONCERNED. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF THIS INSTITUTION, THEY WERE ANCHORED IN MAKING SURE THAT POLITICAL PRESSURE WOULD BE AS LIMITED AS POSSIBLE IN TERMS OF THE DECISIONS THE COMMITTEE MAKES, SO IT IS STRUCTURED TO PROTECT THE LONG RUN VIEW. IT'S CRITICAL AND DURABLE OVER THE LAST 100 PLUS YEARS, SO THAT IS AT STAKE. HOW WILL THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS PLAY OUT AND TAKE A LONG TERM FOCUS? > > HOW MUCH OF A DISTRACTION IS THIS FOR FED OFFICIALS GIVEN THE BACK AND FORTH WITH TRUMP? > > THERE IS A LOT OF NOISE BECAUSE THERE IS ENOUGH UNCERTAINTY RELATIVE TO THE ECONOMY. AVRIL: FORMER KANSAS FED PRESIDENT. NOW WE'LL HAVE MORE AHEAD, THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a > > WE ARE HEADING TOWARD THE JAPAN MARKET OPEN WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN THE YEN. NIKKEI HAS BEEN UP IN THE PAST WEEK, BUT JGB FUTURES CLIMBED AND THE FINANCE MINISTRY ASKED DEALERS ABOUT ISSUANCE OF SUPER LONG BONDS. WE ARE FOLLOWING MODI AND ISHIBA PLEDGING DEEPER TIES AGAINST U.S. TARIFFS. MODI SECURED A PLEDGE, SO LET'S BRING IN REPORTER YOSHIAKI. WHAT WAS DISCUSSED AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? > > THE MAJOR TAKEAWAY WAS JAPAN AND INDIA WANT TIES WITH EACH OTHER AS THEY FACE HIGHER U.S. TARIFFS. AVRIL: SO WHAT IS NEXT FOR ISHIBA AND MODI? > > MODI IS IN CHNINA -- CHINA, WITH ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP TO MANAGE. ISHIBA PLACES -- FACES PRESSURE TO STEP DOWN FOLLOWING THE POOR ELECTION RESULTS, BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THE PRESSURE IS ESCALATING. HE WILL DECIDE WHETHER TO STAY ON OR STEP DOWN. SHERY: THE VISIT OF JAPAN'S TRADE NEGOTIATOR TO WASHINGTON DC WAS CANCELED SO WHAT CAN WE EXPECT ON THAT FRONT? > > WHAT IS GOING ON IS THE DEAL WAS REACHED IN A SURPRISING DEAL IN LATE JULY BUT NONE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION HAS TAKEN PLACE AT THIS POINT SO THE CANCELLATION OF THE TRIP SUGGESTS A GAP BETWEEN THE NATIONS TO HAMMER OUT WHETHER THE U.S. WANTS THE INVESTMENT BEFORE THEY SIGN OFFICIALLY OF THE CUTS. JAPAN WANTS THE TARIFFS CUTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO GET GOING ON THIS? AVRIL: WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE A GOOD OUTCOME? HELP US MANAGE EXPECTATIONS FOR NEGOTIATIONS THIS WEEK. YOSH IAKI: GOOD QUESTION, BUT ANOTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS A DEAL HAS BEEN MADE AND RIGHT NOW IT IS ABOUT THE DETAILS. IF THE JAPAN CAN PRESS AHEAD FOR QUICK IMPLEMENTATION IT WILL BE GREAT LOOKING FOR RESIDENTS. THE U.S. HAS TO DO THE SAME. IT DOES NOT JUST LOWER THE TARIFFS WITHOUT INVESTMENT INTO THE U.S. SO BOTH SIDES HAVE INCENTIVES WITH HOW TO PRESENT THEMSELVES, LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT TO DELIVER WHAT THEY HAVE PROMISED TO DO. SHERY: BLOOMBERG ECONOMICS AND GOVERNMENT REPORTER, GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US. LET'S DISCUSS GEOPOLITICS WITH PAUL, FROM TEMPLE UNIVERSITY IN JAPAN. GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE RELATIONSHIPS TOGETHER BECAUSE HAVING A TENSE RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA, WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR JAPAN? PAUL: THE MEETING IS A REMINDER STUFF HAPPENS BEYOND DONALD TRUMP. JAPAN AND INDIA HAVE BEEN COOPERATING ON AUTOS, POSSIBLY ROBOTICS, SEMICONDUCTORS, NUCLEAR. AS OUR PREVIOUS GUEST AND YOU JUST SAID, THE U.S. IS PUSHING THEM TOGETHER, MUCH MORE OF AN ACCELERANT THAN SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN THE ABSENCE OF U.S. PRESSURE. BOTH COUNTRIES WILL GET HIT BY TARIFFS, BOTH ARE GOING TO NEED TO COOPERATE TO BOOST ECONOMIC RESILIENCY, SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCY. TO WEATHER THE STORM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. SHERY: COOPERATION IS ON BUSINESS AND TRADE, WHAT ABOUT POLITICAL ALIGNMENT BETWEEN CHINA AND JAPAN AND INDIA WHEN INDIA IS GETTING CLOSER TO CHINA? > > IF YOU ARE A CHINA HAWK IN THE U.S., THIS IS NOT GREAT, NOT WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE WANTED. YOU WOULD HAVE WANTED INDIA AND JAPAN TO BE PART OF AN ARC TO CONTAIN OR DETER CHINA AND SO TO SEE TRUMP ALIENATE FRANKLY MODI FOR THE REASON THAT HE HAS, NOT A GEOPOLITICAL REASON, HE'S JUST MAD THAT MODI WILL NOT BACK HIM UP FOR THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE, THAT IT IS NOT GREAT IF YOU ARE TRYING TO BUILD A COALITION AGAINST CHINESE COERCION. NOW I WILL NOT SAY THAT THE ALIGNMENT IS FRACTURING BECAUSE JAPAN AND INDIA BOTH HAVE REASONS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT CHINA'S COERCION. THAT EXISTS WITHOUHT TRUMP, BUT WITHOUT THE U.S. AT THEIR BACK, THAT'S NOT IDEAL, SO THIS ALLIGNMENT TIGHTENING MAKES SENSE. AVRIL: FOR TRUMP, MAYBE HE MIGHT NOT WELCOME THIS. WE ARE SEEING CENTRALIZED DECISION MAKING IN A WAY. WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF TARIFFS, NOW THAT IT COULD BE DEEMED ILLEGAL BY A COURT? PAUL: THE LEGALITY WILL HANG OVER THIS WHOLE THING. IF THE SUPREME COURT AFFIRMS THE DECISION THAT TARIFFS ARE ILLEGAL, TRUMP STILL HAS OPTIONS ON FIRM LEGAL GROUND, NOT IDEAL BECAUSE YOU EITHER NEED CONGRESS ON BOARD OR YOU GO SECTOR BY SECOTR, TARIFFS ON STEEL, AUTOS, AS MANY SECTORS AS YOU WANT, SO HE HAS OPTIONS, EVEN IF THE LIBERATION TARIFFS GO AWAY, THEY WILL BE PART OF TRUMP'S PLAN. HOW COUNTRIES RESPOND IS HARD TO SAY. JULY'S DEALS INDICATE THAT COUNTRIES WANT TO RESPOND IN A WAY THAT KEEP THE U.S. N -- IN THE ROOM, BUT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED TO SEE COUNTRIES SLOW-WALKING TALKS, TAKING THEIR TIME MORE. AND THE OTHER THING, YOU ARE ALMOST SEEING THE BARE INDICATIONS THAT THESE TARIFFS MAY NOT STAND UP. NOT A SURPRISE, BUT WHY ARE YOU SAYING IT OUT LOUD? THAT'S WEIRD TO ME, SO THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT TALKS. SHERY: PAUL, ADJUNCT PROFESSOR AT TEMPLE. OUT OF JAPAN, WE ARE GETTING CAPITAL SPENDING DATA TO THE UPSIDE, COMING IN ABOVE ESTIMATES FOR 6.1%. IT GOES TO SHOW YOU BUSINESSES INCREASING INVESTMENTS. THIS WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BANK OF JAPAN WITH WAGE DATA LATER THIS WEEK. CATCH JAPAN AHEAD, SUBSCRIBERS CAN USE THE TV  FUNCTION ON THE TERMINAL. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a AVRIL: HERE IS THE LATEST FROM THE CORPORATE FRONT, U.S. LISTED SHARES OF ALIBABA SOLD AFTER SURGING REVENUE FROM CHINA'S AI BOOM, A TRIPLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE POINT GAIN IN REVENUE OFFSETTING A DROP IN PROFIT. ALIBABA CREATED A CHIP CAPABLE OF OPERATING AI SERVICES AS NVIDIA FACES HURDLES. WE WILL BE WATCHING BYD LATER, POSTING A SURPRISE DROP IN QUARTERLY DROP AMID FIERCE COMPETITION, WITH MARGINS SLIPPING TO THEIR WEAKEST SINCE 23. TRUMP IS TIGHTENING EXPORT RULES FOR SAMSUNG AND SK HYNIX, REVOKING WAIVERS TO USE U.S. TECH IN CHINESE OPERATIONS. THEY WERE OPERATING UNDER REGULATIONS THAT ALLOW THEM TO IMPORT EQUIPMENT WITHOUT APPLYING FOR A NEW LICENSE EACH TIME. SHERY: ON THAT NEWS, WATCHING SAMSUNG, SK HYNIX AND ALIBABA IS MOVING TO DEVELOP AN AI ACCELERATOR CHIP. WATCH OUT FOR THE HONDA NAMES AS THERE IS SPECULATION OF RESTRUCTURING WITH SPECULATION OVER THE HEALTH OF THE HONORARY CHAIRMAN OF HONDA MOTOR GROUP. A SET UP FOR SUCCESSION IS BIG NEWS. THE MARKET OPENS OUR NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a > > THERE ARE SOME DEVELOPMENTS ON THE CHIP FRONT AS WELL. AS YOU SAY, GEOPOLITICS IN THE BACKDROP SHOOTER. > > THOSE ARE SOME OF THE STOCKS WE\u2019LL BE WATCHING AT THE OPEN RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE SEEN A WEEK OPHIDIANS FOR JAPANESE STOCK MARKETS. THE JAPANESE YEN NOT DOING MUCH IN THE PREVIOUS SESSION BUT WE SAW A MONTH OF GAINS AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. WE\u2019LL BE WATCHING OTHERS AS WELL. PRIMARY DEALERS FOR THEIR DEALS ON REVVING ISSUANCE OF SUPERLONG BONDS. THAT PART OF THE YIELD CURVE. WE\u2019RE ALSO WATCHING CAPITAL SPENDING NUMBERS COMING OUT. RISING TO THE UP SIDE. 7.6% GROWTH. VERY KEY FACTOR FOR WHAT THE B.O.J. COULD DO NEXT. LOOK AT HOW SOUTH KOREA IS OPENING AT THE MOMENT. NUMBERS RISING 3.3 YEAR ON YEAR, BELOW EXPECTATIONS BUT AUGUST WAS A MONTH OF FEWER WORKING DAYS SO UP TO FACTOR THAT IN. WE HAVE ALSO SEEN THE IMPORT NUMBERS, CONTRACTION OF MORE THAN EXPECTED 4.4% YEAR ON YEAR. THAT LEFT A SURPLICE OF 4 BILLION U.S. DOLLARS. IMPORTANT TO WATCH FOR AN INDICATION OF WHERE GLOBAL TRADE IS GOING AS WE\u2019RE TALKING ABOUT HYNIX, THE CHIP MAKERS. AND SOME OTHER NAMES BECAUSE OF SPECULATION OF RESTRUCTURING, AVRIL. AVRIL: WE\u2019RE ALSO GOING TO BE WATCHING SOME OF THE CHINESE CHIP-RELATED STOCKS ALONG WITH ALLEY BABBA AS IT SEEMS TO BE MAKING SOME HEADWAY WHEN IT COMES TO ITS A.I. ACCELERATED CHIPS BUT LET\u2019S LOOK AT THE AUSTRALIAN 8888 MARKETTEN AUSSIE HOLDING STEAD AGAINST THE GREENBACK. FUTURES APPOINTED TO SOME ASH ARE POINTING TO SOME DOWNSIDE. DATA FROM THE U.S., AT THE END OF THE WEEK, JOBS REPORT AND ALL THIS, AHEAD OF THE FED\u2019S MEETING A COUPLE OF WEEKS? NOW. SO LET\u2019S BRING IN RON TEMPLE. RON, IF YOU COULD FIRST WEIGH IN BECAUSE WE DID GET NUMBERS OUT OF JAPAN ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURE. THAT LOOKED QUITE STRONG. THAT TELLS US LONGER TERM HOW BUSINESSES ARE PLANNING IN THE COUNTRY. WHAT IS YOUR GUESS ON THE TENT THAT THIS SOLIDIFIES THE BET FOR A B.O.J. HIKE IN OCTOBER. > > I\u2019M STILL SKEPTICAL WE\u2019LL GET A RATE HIKE IN THE B.O.J. AND OCTOBER AND EVEN BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THE MARKETS ARE SAYING ABOUT AN 85% CHANCE OF ONE BASIS POINT HIKE BY YEAR END. I THINK THE B.O.J. WOULD BE WELL SERVED NOT TO RAISE RATES. WE\u2019LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR ADDITIONAL SIGNALS. CLEARLY INNATION RUNNING WELL ABOVE THEIR TARGET BUT THERE ARE CLEAR SIGNS THAT THAT INFLATION WILL FADE MOVING THROUGH THE NEXT YEAR SO I\u2019M A BIT SKEPTICAL IN TERMS OF THAT RATE HIKE LIKELIHOOD. > > HOW YOU DO YOU FEEL ABOUT JAPANESE STOCKS AS A WAY TO POSITION, DIVERSIFY AWAY IN THE U.S.? > > I\u2019M POSITIVE ON JAPANESE EQUITIES BUT I THINK IT\u2019S CRITICAL TO BE MANAGING YOUR EXPOSURE IN JAPAN. TO ME WHEN I LOOK AT JAPAN, THIS IS NOT A MACROECONOMIC GROWTH STORY. THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES AROUND DEMOGRAPHICS, AROUND THE BURDEN OF DEBT HAVEN\u2019T REALLY CHANGED BUT WHAT I SEE THAT\u2019S REALLY EXCITING IN JAPAN, THEY HAVE A THREE PART THESIS. DEFLATION IS DEAD. NUMBER TWO, CHANGES TO THE CORPORATE TAKE OVER CODE ARE FORCING COMPANIES TO BETTER MANAGE THEIR BASE AND CAPITAL OPERATIONS AND WE CONTINUE TO SEE CAPITAL OUT OF THE HOUSEHOLD SECTOR OUT OF BANK DOPE SITS AND CURRENCY INTO RISKIER ASSETS. TO THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE BASICALLY GOTTEN RELIGION ON CAPITAL WILL BASICALLY IMPROVE ON SHAREHOLDERS. > > THAT\u2019S WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK, ABOUT RELATIVE ATTRACTIVE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU COMPARE IT TO THE UNITED STATES, WE HAVE SEEN VALUATIONS ALREADY PRETTY STRETCHED. TECH RALLYING AND ON TOP OF, THAT OCTOBER SUPPOSED TO BE A WEAKER MONTH. DOES THIS MEAN YOU WOULD TAKE MONEY OFF THE TABLE IN THE U.S. AND GO ELSEWHERE, INCLUDING JAPAN? > > I DO THINK IF YOU LOOK BACK OVER THE LAST 1 OR 1 YEARS, FROM LATE 2007 TO THE END OF 2024, U.S. EQUITY IS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMED ALMOST ALL MAJOR DEVELOPED AND EMERGING EQUITY MARKETS. I THINK FOR INVESTORS IT\u2019S TOMMY TOO REI EVALUATE THAT VALUATION. THAT IS A REALLY HIGH EXPOSURE DRIVEN IN PART BY THOSE YEARS OF OUT PERFORMANCE BUT IN MY VIEW WE\u2019RE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF AMERICAN EXCEPTLY. \"G.Q.\" P. RATES ARE SLOWING DOWN. I THINK THERE ARE MANY OTHER FACTORS THAT LED TO THE U.S. BEING SEEN AS THE GOLD STANDARD, FROM A CURRENCY PERSPECTIVE, THE RESERVE CURRENCY. TREASURIES IS THE SAFIST PLACE TO PARK YOUR MONEY AND EQUITIES THE BEST FOR GROWTH. I THINK THOSE ARE BEING CHESSED AWAY AND I THINK IT\u2019S A GOOD TIME FOR INVESTORS TO BE LOOKING AT NON-U.S. MARKETS. AVRIL: WOULD YOU ALSO LEAN TOWARDS EMERGING MARKETS? WE HAVE SEEN THE LONGEST WINNING STREAK ON A MONTHLY BASIS SINCE 2007 AND HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS CHINA AND WOULD YOU PUT YOUR BET ON CHINA AT THIS POINT? RON: MY FAVORITE BET IS ON EMERGING MARKETS, AND THAT\u2019S A FIVE TO 10-YEAR VIEW. IT\u2019S HARD TO DISENTANGLE HOW MUCH IS JUST DRIVEN BY CHINA BUT IN EMERGING MARKETS, I SEE GROWING ECONOMIES. YES, THERE ARE ISSUES. WHAT WE\u2019RE SEEING IN INDONESIA AND THAILAND ARE GREAT REMINDERS THAT YOU CAN HAVE POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THAT CAN BE TEMPORARY OR MORE EXTENDED BUT I LOOK AT EVALUATION THAT IS NINE MULTIPLES CHEAPER THAT THAN THE UNITED STATES AND BY THE WAY, OVER NEXT 12 MONTHS WHERE YOU\u2019RE LIKELY TO GET BETTER EARNINGS GROWTH THAN EMERGING MARKETS IN THE U.S., I THINK IS THIS IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE PLACE FOR INVESTORS. AVRIL: THERE IS STILL A HEAD WINDS WHEN IT COMES TO CHIP. THE REVOKING OF SOME OF THESE WAIVERS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, HOW ARE YOU INCLUDING THAT IN YOUR ASSESSMENT? RON: I THINK THAT\u2019S A GREAT POINT IN THE DEVELOPED MARKETS, IT\u2019S INCREASINGLY TRUE OF MOST MARKETS. YOUR GOAL IS TO FORECAST THE CASH FLOWS OF THE COMPANY THEN FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RIGHT DISCOUNT RATE IS. FIGURE OUT WHAT TODAY\u2019S TRUE VALUE IS BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO WORK AROUND OTHER ISSUES AROUND RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENT POLICY CHANGES, ETC. SO I THINK IT\u2019S CRITICAL REGARDLESS OF COUNTRY YOU\u2019RE LOOKING IN THAT YOU HAVE A REALLY FIRM GRASP OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF EACH COMPANY. UNDERSTAND HOW MACROAND GEOPOLITICAL CAN AFFECT THOSE AND PUT A PRICE ON IT. EVEN WITH ALL THAT I DO THINK YOU STILL HAVE SOME EXCEPTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN EMERGING MARKETS. SHERY: RON TEMPLE, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT WILL CZAR. LOOK AT SOME OTHER MOVES IN THE SOUTH KOREAN MARKET, ESPECIALLY HYUNDAI. NEWS THAT HYUNDAI HEAVY IS NOW ABSORB SORBING HYUNDAI NIPO IN DECEMBER. RAISING BETS ON A SERIES OF RESTRUCTURING MOVES FOR SUCCESSION. YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A MIXED PICTURE BUT DO KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE HONDA SHARE THAT IS RALLIED IN THE PREVIOUS SESSION. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. > > BECOME FRIENDLY NEIGHBORS AND SUPPORTING PARTNERS AND REALIZING THAT DRAG JOINING TOGETHER SHOULD BE THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR BOTH SIDES. SIMILARY: CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING MEETING WITH INDIA LEADER MODI. STEPHEN ENGEL JOINS OUT FROM THE EVENT AND WHAT CAME OUT OF THOSE SUMMIT TALKS? > > THERE\u2019S GOING TO BE NO TALKS NO DOUBT WITH X AND I, PUTIN AND MODI AND OTHER LEADERS. MORE THAN 20 LEADERS HERE AT THE SHANGHAI CORPORATION ORGANIZATION OR S.C.E. IN HIS 25TH YEAR. IT WAS FORMED IN 2001. HASN\u2019T REALLY BEEN ABLE TO GENERATE A UNIFIED VOICE BUT THIS IS THE BIGGEST FATHERING SO FAR LED BY ONE OF THE FOUNDING NATIONS, CHINA, AND XI JINPING, THEY\u2019RE CONTROLLING THE MAYOR ACTIVE A LITTLE BIT. WE\u2019RE HEARING THAT MEDIA CENTER, WHICH IS NEXT DOOR TO THE MAIN VENUE BUT THEY KIND OF HAVE THE MEDIA SEQUESTERED HERE SO THERE\u2019S FOOT A LOT OF CROSS POLLINATION BETWEEN POLITICIANS AND PRESS RIGHT NOW SO WE\u2019RE HOPING TO GET MORE HEADLINES OUTSIDE AS THE MORNING GOES ON AS XI AGAIN HOSTS EASE OTHER LEADERS. THIS IS THE FI FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS YOU\u2019RE GOING TO HAVE THE LEADERS OF CHINA, RUSSIA, INDIA, PAKISTAN AND IRAN ALL ON THE SAME PODIUM TALKING ABOUT THEIR SHARED INTERESTS AMID THE TRADE WAR LAUNCHED BY DONALD TRUMP EARLIER THIS YEAR. AGAIN, THE XI-MODI DYNAMIC IS THE ONE WE\u2019RE REALLY WATCHING CLOSELY FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT HEADLINES HOPEFULLY OTHER THAN MODI ANNOUNCING THAT CHINA AND INDIA ARE GOING TO RESUME DIRECT FLIGHTS. THEY WERE HALTED DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT NEVER RESUMED BECAUSE OF BALAD BLOOD BETWEEN CHINA AND INDEPENDENCE AYE OVER BORDER DISPUTES. NOW, WE DON\u2019T HAVE A TIME FRAME BUT FLIGHTS ARE GOING TO RESUME. WE\u2019VE HEARD INDEPENDENCE TWO HAS INTEREST AND I WOULD ASSUME AIR INDIA WILL BE A PART OF THAT. WHAT KIND OF HEADLINES ARE WERE GOING TO GET LATER TODAY? WILL THERE BE A COHESIVE, UNIFIED STATEMENT COMING FROM THE S.C.O.? SO FAR HEADLINES IN THE CHINA TAILLIE HAVE BEEN SIMILAR TO THIS. FAIRLY VAGUE COMMENTS. S.C.O. TO CHART COURSE FOR A SHARED FUTURE. THAT IS OBVIOUS, NO DOUBT BUT ARE WE GOING TO GET ANY OIL OR ENERGY DEALS BETWEEN CHINA AND RUSSIA? ARE WE GOING TO GET FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR THE BURGEONING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHINA AND INDIA? AVRIL: WE\u2019RE ALSO LOOKING AHEAD TO THE MILITARY PARADE WHERE CHINA CAN SHOWCASE ITS MILITARY MIGHT BUT ALSO COMING AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A PURGE IN THE P.L.A. DOES IT TAKE SOME OF THE SHINE OFF? > > WE KNOW THE BACKGROUND OF P.L.A. AND IT HAS MODERNIZED ITS MILITARY BUT THERE HAS BEEN A PURGE OF TOP OFFICERS IN THE DEFENSE MINI CITY AS WELL AS WITHIN THE RANKS OF GENERALS WITHIN THE PEOPLE\u2019S GENERATION ARMY SO THERE\u2019S A TIGHTSENING OF DISCIPLINE BY XI JINPING WITHIN THE MILITARY RANKS. BUT THERE\u2019S ALSO BEEN AN EXTREME PUSH OF MODERNIZATION. WITH DRONE TECHNOLOGIES, HYPER SUPERSONIC TECHNOLOGIES AND OF COURSE THEIR FIGHTER JETS AND STEALTH FIGHTERS AND BOMBERS WHICH WILL MOST LIKELY FLY OVER BEIJING AND TIANANMEN JUDICIARY ON WEDNESDAY -- SQUARE ON WEDNESDAY WHERE THERE WILL BE THAT BIG MILITARY PARADE. THERE WAS ONE FIVE YEARS AGO BUT THE LEAST ONE, THEY MARKED THE END OF WORLD WAR II, THE 70TH I WAS IN HE WAS, WE WERE THERE -- ANNIVERSARY, WE WERE THERE AT TIANANMEN SQUARE. WE\u2019LL BE THERE AGAIN. YOU\u2019LL SEE XI JINPING, NO DOUBT, PUTIN AND JOHN ILL UP AMONG OTHER LEADERS. MODI NOT EXPECTED TO BE THERE. I GO BACK TO THAT BECAUSE THAT IS THE MAIN STORY RIGHT NOW HERE AT THE S.C.O., THE CHINA-INDIA RELATIONSHIP AND HOW FAR DOES INDIA GO IN BUILDING THE RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA AT A TIME WHEN WASHINGTON IS IMPOSING 50% TARIFFS ON NEW DELHI BECAUSE OF INDIA\u2019S PURCHASE OF RUSSIAN OIL. SO THAT IS THE BIG DYNAMIC WE\u2019D LIKE TO FLESH OUT HERE. AVRIL: STEPHEN ENGEL THERE ON SIDE AS WE COME TO FOLLOW THE INDIA PRIME MINISTER\u2019S BUSY SCHEDULE. SHERY: YOU ALSO MET WITH JAPANESE COUNTER PARTS. PLEDGING AN INVESTMENT PLEDGE OF UP TO 68 BILLION FROM TOKYO, PART OF A BROADER ECONOMIC PACT FOCUSED ON SEMICONDUCTORS, CRITICAL MINERALS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. U.S. TRAINING PARTNERS ARE FACING INCREASING UNCERTAINTY AFTER A FEDERAL COURT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S WERE ISSUED ILLEGALLY. JILL JOINS US. PRETTY CONFUSE CONFUSING BECAUSE YOU\u2019VE HAD THE U.S. TRADE DEALS AND ON TOP OF THAT, YOU HAVE THESE LOCAL RULINGS, MAY SIGNAL THAT THESE TWO SO-CALLED LIBERATION DAY TARIFFS ARE ILLEGAL? ARE THERE ANY IMMEDIATE IMPLICATION FOR TRADE? > > GOOD MORNING. THE ENTIRE SITUATION IS ADDING TO THE CONFUSION. WHILE THE COURT DID DEEM THESE ILLEGAL AND WE STILL WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION\u2019S PATH FORWARD IS. IT COULD BE THAT THEY APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURT. THE APPEALS COURTS HAVE SAID THAT THE TARIFFS COULD STAY IN PLACE WHILE THEY\u2019RE WORKING THROUGH THE COURTS. SOME OF THESE LOWER COURTS HAVE SAID THAT THE LIBERATION TARIFFS, ANYTHING ANNOUNCED AS PART OF THAT BIG LIBERATION DAY SO-CALLED RECIPROCAL FIGURE THAT IS TRUMP ANNOUNCED. THAT\u2019S WHAT\u2019S BEING THROWN INTO QUESTION HERE. SO YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF TARIFFS ON CANADA, MEXICO. A LOT OF OTHER REGIONAL TARIFFS. WE\u2019RE SEEING THEM SAY ALL TARIFFS ARE IN EFFECT. THAT\u2019S TRUE BECAUSE THAT\u2019S WHAT THIS COURT HAS ULTIMATELY ALLOWED TO CONTINUE BUT FACT THERE\u2019S NO FINAL RESOLUTION DOES LEAD TOT QUESTION OF WHETHER THESE COULD ALL BE DEEMED ILLEGAL SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE. > > ONE OF OUR GUESTS EARLIER ON THE PROGRAM TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WOULDN\u2019T BE SURPRISED IF THIS LATEST DEVELOPMENT TAKES SOME OF HEAT OFF THE IMMEDIACY OF NEGOTIATIONS. THE U.S. AND JAPAN TRADE TALKS ARE EXPECTED TO RESUME. WHERE ARE WE EXPECT THE FROM JAPAN AND THE U.S.? > > WHAT\u2019S BEEN A STAKING POINT WITH THE U.S.-JAPAN TALKS IS THAT THERE WERE SOME TARIFF LEVELS RELATED TO AUTOS THAT WERE APPARENTLY AGREED TO EARLIER THIS SUMMER. IT DOES SEEM LIKE THERE\u2019S BEEN SOME KIND OF HOLD-UP IN TERMS OF RIGHTS PURCHASES. THE U.S. WANTS JAPAN TO AGREE TO MORE RIGHTS PURCHASE FROM JAPAN. SO SOME STICKING POINTS THERE BUT I THINK THE BROADER ISSUE WITH U.S.-JAPAN NEGOTIATIONS SHOWS YOU IN THE CASE OF SOME NATIONS THAT KIDDIE AGREE WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO VARIOUS DIFFERENT LEVIES, THERE\u2019S STILL SOMETHING OPEN HERE. I THINK IT REFLECTS THE FACT THAT IT\u2019S REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT TO REACH COMPREHENSIVE AFRAID AGREEMENT IN A MERIT AFTER MONTHS. PRE-TRUMP T.O.0. , SOME OF THESE HAVE TAKEN YEARS TO NEGOTIATE. WITH SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS IN PLACE, YOU HAVE DO HAVE OCCASIONS WHERE COUNTRIES MAY BE TRYING TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE U.S. FOR BETTER DEALS. NOW YOU\u2019VE ADDED IN THE FACT THAT A LOT OF THESE DEALS AREN\u2019T NECESSARILY 100% COMPLETELY NEGOTIATED WITH THIS POTENTIAL UNCERTAINTY OVER HOW SOME OF IT COULD BE THROWN OUT IN COURTS ULTIMATELY. AVRIL: JILL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. TURNING TO INDONESIA AS WELL, ONE OF THE COUNTRIES FACING TARIFF RISKS. PARLIAMENT HAS SCRAPPED CONTROVERSIAL LAWMAKER PARKS THAT ARE BROUGHT THIS CONTROVERSY AND SO UNCERTAINTY. WE BRING IN SORAYA. HOW\u2019D WE GET TO THIS STAGE? WHY IS THERE SO MUCH UNHAPPINESS AMONG THE PEOPLE? > > THANK YOU AND MORNING. SO THE PROTESTS REALLY BEGAN LAST MONDAY WHEN HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS RALLIED AGAINST A SIGNIFICANT PAY INCREASE FOR LAWMAKERS. THIS IS AT A TIME WHEN THE ECONOMY IS NOT LOCKING TOO WELL AND AN EQUALITY CORRUPTION CASES AND JOB LOSSES IN THE STEPS OF THOUSANDS SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR, ESPECIALLY IN THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY. ALL THESE THINGS ARE CREATING FRUSTRATION AMONG THE PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IN INDONESIA AND THE WORKING CLASS BUT THE SITUATION ESCALATED DRAMATICALLY WHEN A MOTORCYCLE TAXI DRIVER WAS KILLED AFTER BEING RUN OVER BY A SPEEDING ARMORED POLICE VEHICLE AND HE WAS THERE TO DELIVER A PACKAGE SO HE WASN\u2019T EVEN PART OF THE PRO TEST. THIS WAS CAUGHT ON VIDEO AND RAPIDLY SENT ON GROUP CHAT IN SOCIAL MEDIA. WHAMMED TO BE MANAGEABLE PROTESTS AND TURNED INTO THE MOST SERIOUS TEST YET FOR THE PRESIDENT WHO IS ONLY LIKE 10 MONTHS INTO HIS TERM AND BY FRIDAY, THE MAIN STOCK INDEX HAS SLIPPED 1.5%. WORST PERFORMER IN THE WORLD AT THAT POINT AND DEEPER THAN IT PEERS IN INDONESIA. THAT PROMPTED BANK OF INDONESIA TO SAY THEY ARE STAYING IN THE MARKET. > > IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN DO AT THIS POINT? > > YES, THE PRESIDENT, AFTER CANCELING HIS TRIP TO CHINA CHINA, THEN HELD MEETINGS WITH POLITICAL LEADERS AND HIS CABINET MINISTERS AND IN A TELEVISED ADDRESS HE GAVE A STRONG WARNING AGAINST PROTESTERS. HE ORDERED POLICE AND THE MILITARY WHO\u2019S BEEN ASKED TO HIPP, TAKE THE FIRMEST RESPONSE IF NEEDED. HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT PARTLIMENT HAS AGREED TO DROP THE CONTROVERSIAL HOUSING ALLOWANCE. AS OF NOW, THERE ALREADY STILL POCKETS OF PROTESTS ON THE CAPITAL AS WELL AS IN OTHER CITIES AND IN ANTICIPATION OF FURTHER ARRESTS. GOVERNMENT HAS ADVISED PEOPLE TO WORK FROM HOME TODAY. > > SO THESE PROTESTS COULD CONTINUE FAR WHILE YET BUT I WANTED TO PICK ON SOMETHING THAT YOU PICKED ON EARLIER. ABOUT HAVING TO BOTH PONY HIS TULIP TO CAMBODIA. PRABOWO. WHAT READY IMPLICATION THERE? > > I THINK IT WAS KIND OF EXPECTED. OF COURSE, IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER HE\u2019S GOING THERE. ONCE A TENSE SITUATION HAS CALMED DOWN A BUILD BUT YEAH, THAT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD WATCH FOR OVER THE NEXT FEW DAY. > > THANK YOU SO MUCH. TURNING TIE HAND. POLITICAL JOSTLING THIS IS INTENSIFYING FOLLOWING THE COURT-ORDERED OUSTING OF PRIME MINISTER. THE PARTY MET WITH EXECUTIVES OF THE PEOPLE\u2019S PARTY TO SEEK SUPPORT TO FORM A GOVERNMENT OF THE THE PEOPLE\u2019S PARTY IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST GROUP IN PARLIAMENT AND IS IN POLE POSITION APPOINT NEXT PRIME MINISTER. THE UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE\u2019S ASIA INSTITUTE WILL UNION US LATER THIS HOUR AND LATER ON, CHINA SHOW. THE PROTESTS ROCKING INDONESIA. MORE AHEAD ON \"THE RAREA TRADE.\" THIS IS BLOOMBERG. > > TAKE A LOOK AT HOW EUROPEAN FUTURES ARE TRADING. U.K. FUTURES DROPPED AFTER A WINDFALL TAX WAS SUGGESTED ON COMMERCIAL BANKS. SEPTEMBER A BIG MONTH FOR FRANCE. WE HAVE A CONFIDENCE VOTE ON SEPTEMBER 8. SWISS INFLATION DATA AND ALSO U.K. HOUSING PRICING AS WELL. MORE AHEAD ON \"THE ASIA TRADE.\" THIS IS BLOOMBERG. > > TAKE A LOOK AT THE EARLY TRADING SESSION ACROSS ASIA. NIKKEI STOCKS HEADING HIGHER BUT TECH STOCKS UNDER PRESSURE. WATCH OUT FOR CHIP STOCKS ACROSS SOUTH KOREA. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL REVOKE WAIVERS FOR A COUPLE OF COMPANIES FOR PRODUCTION. THERE ARE SPECULATIONS OF RESTRUCTURING MOVE US THAT COULD TAKE THESE STOCKS HIGHER. THE 200, ON DOWNSIDE OF .2%. AVRIL: WE WERE JUST FEDDING SOME OF THESE DATA POINTS. THE S & P GLOBAL MANUFACTURING P.P.E. INCLUDING JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA AND TAIWAN. SOUTH KOREA FIRST, WE\u2019RE SEEING IT PICK UP A LITTLE FROM THE PRIOR READING. COMING IN AT 49.7 AND FOR TAIWAN SITTING AT 47.4 SO A BIT BETTER THAN PRIOR READING FOR TAIWAN BUT IN THESE MAJOR ECONOMIES, IT IS STILL STUCK IN CAN CONTRACTION IN INDONESIA, 51.5. THIS IS A FASTER PACE THAN THE PRIOR READING, WHICH WAS IN CARON TRACTION OF 49.2. DATA FROM THE PHILIPPINES AS WELL IN EXPANSION ON THESE MANUFACTURING P.M. AIRPORT OF I.\u2019S. INDONESIA, SOME DATA COMING IN FROM THE P.M.I. MANUFACTURING BUT THE COMPANY IS IN THE SPOTLIGHT AS THE PRESIDENT HAS CALLED FOR CALM AFTER VIOLENT DEMONSTRATIONS OVER THE WEEKEND AND PARLIAMENT HAS SCRAPPED CONTROVERSIAL LAWMAKER DECISIONS THE. AND POLITICAL TENSION IS INTENSIFYING IN TAIWAN. JOINING US NOW IS THE PROFESSOR OFFISH STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE\u2019S ASIAN INSTITUTE. REALLY GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. HE\u2019S START OFF WITH INDONESIA. AS WE SEE, THERE\u2019S BEEN LONG-RUNNING DISCONTENT ABOUT THESE LAWMAKERS\u2019 ALLOWANCES. WHY HAVE THINGS BOILED OVER AT THIS STAGE? > > WELL, THE RIOTING, THE PROTEST EXPRESSES REALLY LONG-SIMMERING DISCONTENT WHICH ARE CULMINATING NOW IN THE SCENES YOU\u2019RE SEEING IN JAKARTA NOW. YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR ARE FINDING IT VERY HARD TO FIND JOBS. MIDDLE CLASS IS BEING SQUEEZED AND THERE IS WIDESPREAD PERCEPTION THAT THE -- ARE OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE SITUATION OF ORDINARY PEOPLE AND THEN WHEN THE RULE MAKERS WITH THESE EXORBITANT PERKS, I THINK IT TAPPEDDED INTO A LOT OF THOSE SIMMERING ANGERS. BUT EVEN THOUGH TO THE ANGER THE GENERALIN AND VALUED, I THINK ELITE FORCES ARE TRYING TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE AND THEREFORE WE SEE THAT THE SITUATION HAS ESCALATED AND THERE\u2019S LOT OF ELITE WHEELING AND DEALING HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES. > > COULD YOU SHARE A BIT MORE ON THAT? ELITE DEALING BEHIND THE SCENES? WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONSES FOR INDEPENDENCE NEARBIEN POLITICS? > > THE THICK IS THIS, I DON\u2019T WANT TO TAKE AWAY FROM THE GENUINE NATURE OF ANGER BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE IS GROWING CHISEL BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT\u2019S CAMP AND THAT OHIO OF HIS PRETTY SAYSOR. IT SEEMS TO ME IMPROBABLE WHAT A SITUATION SUCH AS THIS WOULD NOT SOMEHOW FEED IN TO SOME OF THEIR POLITICAL CALCULATION IN TERMS OF BALANCING DEPOSITION VISA VOLUNTEER EACH OTHER AND THIS SING SHOWN BY THE FACT THAT PRABOWO HAS BROUGHT IN ALL OF THE LEADERS OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES OF INDONESIA TO ENSURE THAT THEY WILL SUPPORT HIS ACTIONS IN DEALING WITH THE UNREST AND TO MAKE SURE THAT OPPONENTS ALREADY NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE MISSED FACT THAT AFTER THAT MEETING WITH THE POLITICAL LEADERS, THERE WERE A SERIES OF POINTS THAT CAME OUT AND THEY MIGHT HAVE MISSED THAT HE DID MENTION INDICATIONS OF TREASON AND TERROR. AND THAT IS, IN POLITICAL LICKO, SORT OF QUESTIONING WHETHER THERE\u2019S PEOPLE BEHIND ALL OF THIS. AVRIL: DO YOU EXPECT THE PRESIDENT JUST TO REVIVE THIS UPHEAVAL? SHERY: AND WE HAVE SEEN THEM TRYING TO REVOKE THOSE LAWMAKER PARTS BUT THERE THAT BE ENOUGH AND WHAT ELSE CAN HE DO? > > I THINK REVOKING THE LAWMAKERS\u2019 PERKS WAS THE LONG CAL MINIMUM STEP TO TAKE AND HE\u2019S ALES CONVINCED THE PARTIES TO WITHDRAW THEIR CONTROVERSIAL MEMBERS WHO HAVE MADE STATEMENTS WHICH SEEM TO HAVE JUST MAKE PEOPLE ANGRIER THAN THEY HAD BEEN, WITH YOU THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES IN INDONESIA WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO BELEAGUER HIS GOVERNMENT AND THE THING IS THAT HE IS ACTUALLY TIED UP WITH A LOT OF THE INTERESTS THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, CONTINUE IN ENSURING THAT INDEPENDENCE NEARBIEN GOVERNMENT POLITICS AND ECONOMICS IS RUN BY OR DRIVEN BY THE LOGIC OF CORRUPTION. IT\u2019S JUST INESCAPABLE FOR HIM TO BE DEALING WITH THESE THINGS. IN FACT, ALL OF HIS ALLIES ARE IMPLICATED IN THESE SORTS OF PRACTICES. > > WE SEE POLITICAL UPHEAVAL IN TAIWAN WITH THE OUSTER OF THE PRIME MINISTER. DOES THAT IS HAVE IMPLICATIONSES FOR THE LANDSCAPE OF POLITICS IN THAILAND AND WHAT CAN WE EXPECT NEXT? > > WELL, AS YOU KNOW -- WELL, THERE IS PLANNED TO BE A PARLIAMENTARY VOTE TO SET UP UNINTERIM GOVERNMENT AND WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING NOW IS, WELL, THE ELITE PARTY WHEELING AND DEALING. REALLY THE MAIN QUESTION IS WHETHER THE PEOPLE\u2019S PARTY, USED TO BE THE MOVE FORWARD PARTY, WILL SUPPORT CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE OR WILL THEY GO WITH OTHER CANDIDATE. IT SEEMS LIKE ANOTIN HAS THE UPPER HAND AT THE MOMENT. BUT IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE P.M. IS CONVINCE ON WHETHER EITHER OF THOSE CANDIDATES WILL DELIVER ON THE PROMISE OF HAVING ELECTIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE P.P. RIGHTLY THINK THAT THEY WOULD WIN SUCH AN ELECTION. > > REALLY GOOD TO GET YOUR INSIGHTS. PROFESSOR OF ASIAN STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE DO HAVE MORE AHEAD ON THE ASIA TRADE. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. > > THE SHANGHAI CORPORATION SUMMIT IS UNDERWAY. THE BIGGEST EVENTS ON CHINESE DIPLOMATIC CALENDARS OF THE YEAR HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER WORLD LEADERS. INDIAN PRIME MINISTER MODI IS USING HIS TRIP TO RESET NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHINA WHILE ALSO LOOKING TO STRENGTHEN TIES WITH RUSSIA. THIS ALL AMIDST THE U.S. TRADE WAR. WE BRING IN OUR GUEST FROM THE CENTER OF STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES. WE HAD PICK PING MEET WITH PRIME MINISTER MODI. WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST TAKEAWAY FROM THESE SUMMIT TALKS AND WHAT WILL YOU BE WATCHING FOR THIS THE NEXT FEW DAYS? > > THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. CHINA-INDIAN LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN IMPROVING ALL THE WAY BACK TO LAST FALL WHEN THERE WAS A BREAKTHROUGH ON THE BORDER AND WE\u2019VE SEEN INCREMENTAL PROGRESS ON RESTORING DIRECT FLIGHTS AND RECENT PROGRESS ON VISAS BUT IT DOES SEEM LIKE PRESIDENT MODI\u2019S MEETING WITH PRESIDENT XI ACCELERATED THINGS. THE TONE WAS POSITIVE. LOT OF LANGUAGE ABOUT PARTNERSHIP AND COLLABORATION. I EXPECT WE WILL SEE ADDITIONAL CONCRETE ECONOMIC COOPERATION IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS AND I THINK WE\u2019LL SEE THAT UNFOLD AT A MUCH ACCELERATED PACE AS A RESULT OF WASHINGTON\u2019S ALMOST INPUBLICABLE DECISION TO LAYER 50% TARIFFS ON DELHI. GIVING IT EXTRA INCENTIVE TO DIVERSIFY AND ALSO TO SHOW WASHINGTON THAT IT CAN. AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS A CEILING ON HOW FAR INDIA WILL BE WILLING TO GO. THERE\u2019S STILL A LOT OF DISTRUST ON THE BORDER. DELHI IS NOT ABOUT TO FORGIVE BEIJING FOR ITS I DON\u2019T THINK GOING AND LONG SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN. SO IN A WAY I\u2019M THINKING OF THE INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE. I THINK WASHINGTON IS QUITE LUCKY THAT EVEN AS IT EMULATES THE U.S.-INDIA RELATIONSHIP, DELHI HAS ITS OWN REASONS TO KEEP A LITTLE BIT OF STANCE FROM BEIJING AND SO, WHEN I THINK OF THAT BROADER CONTEXT, I WOULDN\u2019T BE SURPRISED IF THE U.S. GOES TO DELHI ASKING TO COLLABORATE -- 1. > > BUT DOES THE U.S. HAVE AN INDOE SPECIFIC STRATEGY AT THIS POINT? EVERYTHING THAT WAS ACHIEF ACHIEVED DURING THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, HOW MUCH OF THAT IS STILL IN PLACE AND COULD WE SEE -- AFTER THIS ADMINISTRATION -- WHERE DOES WASHINGTON SEE THE U.S.-INDIA RELATIONSHIP GOING FROM HERE? > > IT\u2019S A GREAT QUESTION. I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS THERE IS NO SINGLE INDOE-SPECIFIC STRATEGY. NO SINGLE STRATEGY COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON. ON THE ONE HAND, SECRETARY RUBIO, THE SECRETARY OF STATE, HAS CONVENED NUMEROUS MEETINGS WITH HIS QUAD COUNTERPARTS, A GROUP VERY DEPENDENT ON INDIA GOODWILL. INDIA, JAPAN AND THE U.S. AND ON THE OTHER HAND YOU SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP LAYERING ON BRUTAL TARIFFS WITH VERY LITTLE STRATEGIC RATIONALE SO I THINK YOU\u2019LL CONTINUE TO SEE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES PLAYING OUT AT ONCE THAT ARE SOMETIMES CONFLICTING WITH EACH OTHER. > > WHAT ABOUT HOW THE CHINESE PRESIDENT, WHO IS MEETING WITH HIS RUSSIAN COUNTERPART, VLADIMIR PUTIN, HOW IS HE LIKELY TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE WITHOUT POTENTIALLY WIDENING THE SCHISM WITH EUROPEAN COUNTRIES? > > IT\u2019S A GREAT QUESTION. PRESIDENT XI IS DEEPLY COMMITTED ON WHAT SEEMS TO BE A PERSONAL LEVEL TO HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN AND THE CHINA-RUSSIAN PARTNERSHIP AND YOU SEE HIM TRYING TO GO AS FAR AS HE CAN TO SUPPORT THE RUSSIAN WAR EFFORT IN UKRAINE BY PROVIDING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT, BY PROVIDING IMPORT INPUTS TO THE RUSSIAN INDUSTRIAL BASE BUT TRYING TO STOP RIGHT SHORT OF WHERE HE WOULD DO IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE IN HIS MIND TO THE CHINA-EUROPE RHYTHM BECAUSE HE DOES STILL PRIZE THIS LONG-STANDING EFFORT TO SPLIT THE TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCE AND WITH WASHINGTON BECOME SO FLEXIBLE TOWARDS ALLIES AT THIS TIME, CHINA DOES SEE AN OPPORTUNITY WITH EUROPE THAT IT DOESN\u2019T WANT TO LOSE SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW XI TRIES STRIKE THAT BALANCE AFTER THE MEETING. > > YOU ALLUDED TO SOME OF THIS EARLIER. WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF HOW PIVOTAL POTENTIALLY THIS WEEK IS GOING TO BE AS A PORT OF PUSHBACK TO THE U.S.\u2019S GLOBAL ORDER? > > I THINK THAT IS A CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE SUMMIT. CHINA HAS ALWAYS SEEN THE S.E.O. AS A CRITICAL VEHICLE FOR ADVANCING AN ALTERNATIVE VISION OF WORLD ORDER. THAT\u2019S WHY, FOR EXAMPLE, BEIJING PRIZES SO HIGHLY THAT THE U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL ATTENDS THESE MEETINGS IN ADDITION TO MANY NATION STATE PARTNERS SO YOU SEE CHINA TRYING TO SEIZE THIS MOMENT OF POLICY REVERSAL IN WASHINGTON TO ADVANCE AN INTERNATIONAL ORDER MORE FRIENDLY TO CHINESE INTERESTS, TO CHINA\u2019S AUTHORITARIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM WHILE ALSO DEMONSTRATING THE INCREDIBLE CONVENING POWER THAT WE SEE SON DISPLAY AND I THINK BEIJING IS TRYING TO SHOW NOT ONLY THAT IT IS MAKING PROGRESS IN BUILDING THIS ALTERNATIVE ORDER BUT THAT THERE\u2019S SUPPORT FOR IT. > > WE DO HAVE, OF COURSE, THE MILITARY PARADE THIS WEEK. WHEN IT COMES TO THE NORTH KOREAN ISSUE, DO YOU EXPECT PERHAPS NOT NECESSARILY PROGRESS BUT MORE FOCUS THERE ESPECIALLY AS WE\u2019RE HEADED TOWARD APEC IN KOREA? > > I THINK KIM JONG-UN IS WALKING INTO CHINA WITH AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE WHEN IT COMES TO HIS STANDING IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND EVEN IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. RUSSIA\u2019S DESPERATION FOR MILITARY SUPPORT THAT IS PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR NORTH KOREA TO PROVIDE THE RUSSIANS WITH AMMUNITION AND TROOPS AND IN EXCHANGE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF ECONOMIC AND POTENTIALLY MILITARY SUPPORT FROM THE RUSSIANS THAT HAS GIVEN THE NORTH CRANES AND KIM JONG UN A VERY STRONG HAND WHEN TRYING TO MANAGE THEIR OTHER LARGE NEIGHBOR IN BEIJING. SO I DO THINK YOU SEE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE FROM THE NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT AND I THINK YOU\u2019LL SEE THAT ON DISPLAY AT THE PARADE THIS WAYS THAT COULD PRESENT REAL COMPLY OCCASIONS FOR THE U.S. AND ITS ALLIES. > > POTENTIALLY A PIVOTAL WEEK IN CHINA. THANKS SO MUCH. HENRIETTA, A SENIOR FELLOW AT S.I.S. MORE ON THE ASIA TRADE. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. > > HERE ARE SOME OF THE LATERS CORPORATE HEADLINES WE\u2019RE TRACKING. CHINA\u2019S E.V. GIANT TRADES LATER. THE FIRM POSTED A SURPRISED DROP IN QUARTERLY PROFIT AMID FEARS PRICE COMPETITION IN CHINA. FELL 20% LAST QUARTER, MISSING ESTIMATES. THE CARMAKER SOLD 2.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST HALF, JUST SHY OF 40% OF IT ANNUAL TARGET. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS TIGHTENING CHIP EXPORT RULES FOR SEVERAL COMPANIES. WASHINGTON IS REVOKING WAIVERS FOR SOME FIRMS TO USE CHIPS THIS THEIR CHINESE REGULATIONS. THAT ALLOWS THEM TO IMPORT CHIP MAKING EQUIPMENT WITHOUT APPLYING FOR A NEW LICENSE EACH TIME. AVRIL: THAT IS THE CROSS CURRENT WE ARE WATCHING THAT SEEMS TO BE PLAYING OUT IN THE JAPANESE SESSION. LOOK AT THESE DECLINERS. THEY ARE THE BIGGEST DRAGS OF THE NIKKEI. THERE IS ANOTHER HEAD WIND WHEN IT COMES TO JAPANESE CHIP-RELATED STOCKS AND THAT IS IN THE FORM OF ALLEY BABBA. IT SEEMS TO BE MAKING SOME HEADWAY WHEN IT COMES TO A.I. CHIPS. WE\u2019LL BE WATCHING BABA WHEN IT STARTS TRADING THIS IN HONG KONG. LET\u2019S BRING IN KATHERINE. LOOKING AT THESE NUMBERS, BABA EX CLOUD UNITS MISS BUT THEY OUTPERFORM A COUPLE OF OTHERS. IS THIS GOING TO CONTINUE IN THE SECOND HALF? > > THE EXPECTATIONS WEREN\u2019T VERY HIGH. IT WAS A VERY NICE BEAT I WOULD SAY THIS ALIBABA\u2019S PERSPECTIVE. TECH RATE DOES LOOK LIKE IT\u2019S IMPROVING, WHICH IS A GOOD THING AS WELL. AND QUICK COMMERCE, WHICH IS ALL THE FOOD AND ON-DEMAND DELIVERY THAT\u2019S IN THERE. IT\u2019S A FAIRLY NEW SEGMENT I WOULD SAY, WITH ALL THE RECLASS OCCASIONS ITSELF BUT ALIBABA DEFINITELY FELT PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THEY WERE IN A POSITION TO AT LEAST NARROW LOSSES THAT THEY\u2019RE CURRENTLY INCURRING FOR QUICK COMMERCE RIGHT NOW IN THE VERY IMPORTANT OCTOBER-NOVEMBER-DECEMBER QUARTER SO LET\u2019S SEE HOW THEY IMPORTANT THERE. > > WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE METRICS THAT YOU HEED TO FOLLOW FORDELIVERY LEADERSHIP, WHAT WILL BE KEY IN THE BATTLE BETWEEN MAITWON AND ALIBABA? > > THEY\u2019RE LOOKING TO MERGE ITS HE\u2019S ACROSS ITS MULTIPLE FOR EXAMPLE AND THESE ARE VERY ACCESSIBLE, WELL ESTABLISHED APPS. BUT THIS IS GOING TO ACTUALLY DRIVE LOYALTY AMONG THE USERS WHICH EFFECT LIVERY CAN\u2019T INCREASE ORDER FREQUENCY. NOT JUST FOR FOOD OR ON DEMAND BUT EVEN THE DISCRETIONARY GOODS ITSELF AND 8-V.I.P. DID THESE. GOING FORWARD IT IS A BATTLE OF HOW MANY OF THESE MEMBERS AND HOW STICKY EACH OF THOSE FIRMS ARE ACTUALLY TO ABLE HOLD ON TO THESE USERS. DO YOU THINK TAOBAO IS GOING TOCK KEEP ITS USERS WITH THE NEW LOYALTY PLATFORM? > > FROM A NON-FOOD ANGLE. WE ALL SHOP ON TAOBAO. IT\u2019S A HUGE USER BASE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT ALIBABA DEFINITELY HAS THE UPPER HAND. THEY ALL THE HAVE THEY STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES BUT FROM A SKILL BASIS ITSELF, I HAVE TO GIVE IT TO ALIBABA AT THIS POINT IN TIME. > > CATHERINE THERE. GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US. BECAUSE OF ALIBABA NEWS BUT ESPECIALLY CONCERNING THEIR A.I. ACCELERATORS. SOME OF THE STOCKS RELATED TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WE\u2019LL BE WATCHING. THE LIKES OF T.M.C., EXAMPLE, ARE KEY. ESPECIALLY WITH THE NEWS EARLIER ABOUT THE U.S. REVOKING CAMPAIGNS SO SHIP CRITICAL COMMITMENT TO THEIR FACTORIES IN CHINA. ALSO PRICE COMPETITION HITTING THE CHINESE E.V. MAKER. JUST SECONDS AWAY FROM THE OPEN IN CHINA. THAT\u2019S IT FROM \"THE ASIA TRADE.\" WE CONTINUE AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO THE START OF TRADE ELSEWHERE. \"THE CHINA SHOW\" IS NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG.",
