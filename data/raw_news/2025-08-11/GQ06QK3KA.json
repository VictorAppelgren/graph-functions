  "content": "The next batch of inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics was already shaping up to be a high-profile affair due to the expected impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s hefty tariffs. But after Trump fired the agency\u2019s top statistician, Tuesday\u2019s report now comes with some other, unexpected baggage.\n\nJuly\u2019s Consumer Price Index is set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday, just 11 days after Trump\u2019s unprecedented firing of the head of the BLS, following a lackluster jobs report that contained substantial revisions to prior months of employment data. The president baselessly claimed that BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer \u201crigged\u201d the data (an allegation that Trump\u2019s former BLS head and a cadre of statisticians and economists resoundingly disputed).\n\nMoreover, the data that feeds into the CPI could make the closely watched inflation gauge subject to greater revisions, in part due to Trump administration\u2019s budget and staffing cuts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a larger margin of error with an expectation of rolling revisions to the CPI data in a way that is somewhat similar to what we see in the jobs data and the durable goods data,\u201d Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told CNN.\n\nThe BLS, one of many federal agencies subject to the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s blunt axe, has increasingly cut back on the data collection that feeds into the critical pricing gauge.\n\nSince April, the BLS stopped collecting data in three not-so-small metro areas (Buffalo, New York; Lincoln, Nebraska; and Provo, Utah) and further leaned on an imputation process used to estimate prices by means other than direct, local observations (such as making price comparisons on a regional or national basis instead).\n\nThe BLS said in early June that the tri-city collection reductions (which amounted to roughly 3.6% of the CPI\u2019s overall sample) were expected to have \u201cminimal\u201d impact on the overall index but increase the volatility of geographic- or item-specific price indexes.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the agency shared a statistical analysis of those cutbacks using a 77-month study period. It showed that the annual inflation reading was one-tenth of a percentage point higher in 18% of those months and one-tenth of a percentage point lower in 14% of those months.\n\nIn that same notice, however, BLS also disclosed that it made a 15% wholesale reduction in collections across the other 72 coverage areas.\n\n\u201cCollection suspension affects both the Commodity and Services Pricing survey and the Housing survey,\u201d the BLS wrote. \u201cAs a result, the number of collected prices and the number of collected rents used to calculate the CPI has temporarily been reduced.\u201d\n\nThe BLS did not share any statistical analysis of those wider cuts nor provide enough information for others to estimate that, Alan Detmeister, a UBS senior economist who previously helmed the Federal Reserve\u2019s Wages and Prices section, told CNN.\n\n\u201cThe 15% of the remaining sample is four times larger than the number of observations dropped than those three cities,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if those three cities already made it round differently a third of the time. You\u2019re probably talking a tenth or so on overall inflation. Not huge, but it\u2019s something.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely degrading the quality of the inflation statistics,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the reductions in price observations and increase in imputations could make the CPI data \u2014 especially on a monthly basis \u2014 less sharp, it\u2019s not expected to cause similar large variations as seen in the survey-driven jobs report, which is reliant on an increasingly shrinking sample of respondents, RSM\u2019s Brusuelas said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to bore us to sleep watching the back revisions in the CPI and [Personal Consumption Expenditures] data,\u201d he said.\n\nThe issues of greater importance involving the CPI data is what Tuesday\u2019s numbers say about the trajectory of inflation and any coinciding pushback from the Trump administration on any report that shows tariffs are driving prices higher, Brusuelas said.\n\nFor any presidential administration, that\u2019s \u201ctantamount to engaging in self-harm, attempting to tell the public that prices aren\u2019t rising, when they can clearly feel it in their own bottom lines and reduced purchasing power of their paychecks,\u201d he said. \u201cYou saw what happened when the Biden administration tried to play down price increases as inflation growth was slowing. It did not resonate.\u201d\n\nIn June, CPI rose to 2.7%, its highest level in four months, as price increases \u2014 including those from tariffs \u2014 packed a bigger punch.\n\nJuly\u2019s CPI is expected to tell a similar tale: Tariffs are causing higher prices on a wider swath of goods while falling gas prices and tepid consumer demand is keeping a lid on some services prices.\n\nAll in all, the index is expected to rise 0.2% for the month and tick up to 2.8% on an annual basis, according to FactSet consensus estimates.\n\nThe July CPI will show \u201cfurther evidence of tariff-induced inflation eroding the purchasing power of consumer paychecks,\u201d Brusuelas said. \u201cThe thing to understand is this is not going to happen with a bang but more of a slow deterioration in purchasing power.\u201d",

      "text": "Whether or not you agree with the assertion that the US federal government should be shrunk dramatically because it is bloated and inefficient, the attempt to do so by Elon Musk and his team at the Department of Government Efficiency has been chaotic, confusing, abrupt and publicly contemptuous of federal agencies, their employees and the work they do.\nMusk has bragged about feeding USAID into the \u201cwoodchipper\u201d and \u201cdeleting\u201d agencies. In front of a crowd at the 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference, he delivered an impromptu performance with a chainsaw given to him on stage by Argentina\u2019s libertarian president, Javier Milei. \u201cThis is the chainsaw for bureaucracy!\u201d he yelled. \u201cChainsaw!\u201d\nIn some ways, his approach seems to echo his heavy-handed moves when he took over Twitter in 2022.\nBut will the DOGE attempt at a breakneck-speed transformation succeed in turning the federal government into a lean, efficient organization?\nAlmost certainly not, say two leadership experts who advise top executives and organizations on big turnarounds and strategy.\nHere is how Navalent co-founder and managing partner Ron Carucci, who works with CEOs pursuing transformational change, put it based on the publicly available reports he\u2019s seen: \u201cIf you were looking to leave your organization in shambles, unable to perform after downsizing, leaving workers in a paralyzed state of fear, resentment and sabotage, (Musk\u2019s) doing a marvelous job.\u201d\nThe lessons here for corporate leaders tasked with restructuring a company are many, even for those people who are highly critical of the approach Musk and DOGE are taking.\nActing quickly is okay. But only after you\u2019ve done your homework\nThere have been a lot of reports of federal workers being fired then quickly rehired once agencies realized people with critical skills had been let go. (See, for example: Those managing the US nuclear arsenal, and those working at USDA on the response to the bird flu outbreak.)\nHad DOGE, with assistance from the agencies, done its research beforehand, those kinds of sloppy, dangerous errors would be far less likely.\n\u201cMost companies are methodical and reflective about this,\u201d said Cindy Wahler, who helps organizations with leadership assessment, executive coaching and identifying needed leadership competencies. \u201cThere are usually months and months of analysis before any recommendations are made around restructuring.\u201d\nBy doing an extensive diagnostic of your enterprise beforehand, Carucci added, \u201cyou know where the opportunities for reductions are. You don\u2019t just go slicing through.\u201d\nOnce a tailored assessment is done, act quickly to execute, but be truthful about what will happen and why changes are needed, he said. And when delivering the bad news, he added, \u201ccompassion is critical.\u201d\nIf you don\u2019t take the trouble and time to do all of this, any turnaround attempt will be undercut, Carucci warned. \u201cI tell leaders all the time that how and where you cut is going to make a profound, almost irreversible statement about your culture. Likely in a damaging way. Can you do it in a way you can recover?\u201d\nHow you treat people matters \u2026 a lot\nIn an unsigned blast email from the Office of Personnel Management last Saturday afternoon, Musk ordered government workers to pop off five bullet points listing their accomplishments the prior week \u2014 posting on X beforehand that failure to do so would be viewed as their resignation. It caused mass confusion and worry. And it elicited a stream of mixed messages from the actual agency leaders to whom the employees report, raising questions as to who is actually in charge.\nA second email from OPM early Monday evening told workers they were not required to reply, which didn\u2019t clear much up. And the warning included at the end of OPM\u2019s letter to those who chose to respond was also worrying: \u201cAssume that what you write will be read by malign foreign actors and tailor your response accordingly.\u201d\nThen, as if all this hadn\u2019t been fun enough already, Musk at Trump\u2019s first cabinet meeting on Wednesday explained that his weekend email was not meant as a \u201cperformance review\u201d just a \u201cpulse check review.\u201d \u201c(W)e\u2019re literally trying to figure out, are these people real, are they alive and can they write an email?\u201d Musk said.\nThis kind of justify-your-existence threat is yet another way Musk on behalf of the Trump administration has expressed a blanket disregard for federal workers.\n\u201cElon Musk\u2019s philosophy and approach to employees and their work is diametrically opposed to every organization I work with in the public and private sectors,\u201d Wahler said. \u201cThey value preserving employees\u2019 dignity and respect, making them feel that they\u2019re making an important contribution and can feel safe in a collaborative environment.\u201d\nEgo is fine, but humility is also needed\nBeing the world\u2019s richest man with the backing of the US president and more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he owns is not an obvious recipe for humility.\nBut Wahler, a psychologist, said she\u2019s found the best leaders typically have egos but also are humble enough to understand when they\u2019re wrong and don\u2019t know enough about an issue.\nOf course, while speaking to the press next to President Donald Trump in the Oval Office earlier this month, Musk did acknowledge he isn\u2019t perfect. \u201cSome of the things I say will be incorrect and should be corrected. So nobody\u2019s going to bat a thousand \u2026 We will make mistakes, but we\u2019ll act quickly to correct any mistakes,\u201d he said.\nThe tone of his comments, however, was more like \u201c\u2018naturally I\u2019ll break some glass, but it\u2019s not a big deal,\u2019\u201d Carucci said. \u201c(As if) he feels impervious to error.\u201d\nNo corporate leaders, of course, share Musk\u2019s net worth or network. But that doesn\u2019t mean they might not share some of his attitude or behaviors that may undercut their aims when trying to push a whole organization to change.\n\u201cYou might be tempted to confuse speed with efficiency. Or to confuse fairness with across-the-board cuts,\u201d Carucci said. \u201cThese approaches may be more tempting than you think.\u201d\nAt the end of the day, how you execute a restructuring sets the tone for an organization\u2019s future.\nAnd Musk\u2019s approach so far has been read by many of those most immediately affected as antagonistic, demoralizing and callous.\n\u201cAn organization\u2019s reputational integrity is its greatest currency. When you compromise that, you have lost the loyalty and trust of your employees,\u201d Wahler said. \u201cHis approach is going to increase inefficiency by creating an environment marked by instability, a lack of trust and divisiveness.\u201d"

      "text": "President Donald Trump has fired Dr. Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, whom he accused, without evidence, of manipulating the monthly jobs reports for \u201cpolitical purposes.\u201d\nThe BLS\u2019 monthly labor report Friday showed that the US economy added only 73,000 jobs in July, far below expectations. It also sharply revised down the employment growth that had been previously reported in May and June \u2013 by a combined 258,000 jobs.\nAfter the revisions, the jobs report showed the weakest pace of hiring for any three-month period since the pandemic recession in 2020.\n\u201cIn my opinion, today\u2019s Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad,\u201d Trump said in a Truth Social post.\nAlthough the May and June jobs numbers were worse than initially believed, revisions are normal in this process. The BLS\u2019 initial monthly jobs estimates are often based on incomplete data, so they are revised twice after the initial report \u2014 followed by an annual revision every February. Additionally, BLS economists use a formula to smooth out jobs numbers for seasonal variations and that can exacerbate revisions when they fall outside economists\u2019 expectations.\nTrump on Friday incorrectly called the revisions a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\u201cMcEntarfer said there were only 73,000 Jobs added (a shock!) but, more importantly, that a major mistake was made by them, 258,000 Jobs downward, in the prior two months,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social. \u201cSimilar things happened in the first part of the year, always to the negative. The Economy is BOOMING under \u2018TRUMP.\u2019\u201d\nTrump said McEntarfer \u201cfaked\u201d the jobs numbers before the election to try to boost former Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 chances in the 2024 presidential election.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing so well. I believe the numbers were phony, just like they were before the election, and there were other times. So, you know what I did? I fired her, and you know what? I did the right thing,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday on the South Lawn.\nMcEntarfer was confirmed by the Senate 86-8 in January 2024 for a term of four years. CNN has reached out to McEntarfer for comment. Until Trump replaces McEntarfer, Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as Acting Commissioner, the administration said.\nTrump has previously criticized the BLS for its jobs data and revisions, and he told reporters Friday evening he\u2019s \u201calways had a problem with these numbers.\u201d In 2016, during his first presidential campaign, Trump claimed that the unemployment rate was significantly higher than the BLS let on. In 2024, he accused former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration of orchestrating a cover-up, after the BLS reported that it had overcounted jobs by 818,000 over the previous 12 months.\n\u201cI was thinking about it this morning, before the numbers that came out. I said, \u2018Who is the person that does these numbers?\u2019 And then they gave me stats about before the election,\u201d Trump said Friday.\n\u201cWe need people that we can trust,\u201d he added.\nBut Trump and his administration have also praised the BLS data when it has been favorable to them. During Trump\u2019s first term, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in March 2017 that the jobs data was no longer \u201cphony\u201d after the BLS issued a strong jobs report. And a month ago, current White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on social media that the economy had beat expectations for jobs in four straight BLS labor reports.\n\u2018Deeply worrisome\u2019\nThe BLS is nonpartisan, and businesses and government officials rely on the accuracy of its data to make determinations about investment, hiring, spending and all sorts of key decisions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous for anyone in government to question the integrity of the BLS,\u201d said Jason Furman, a Harvard professor and former Obama economic adviser. \u201cAccurate statistics are essential to the economy.\u201d\nFurman doubted that replacing McEntarfer would compromise the BLS, but he said even the possibility or appearance of that notion \u201cwould be bad.\u201d\n\u201cCountries that have tried to fake those statistics have often ended up with economic crises as a result,\u201d Furman said.\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the BLS\u2019 data is at the \u201chighest standard,\u201d and \u201cas accurate as it can be.\u201d\n\u201cAnything that undermines that or even the perception of that high standard is deeply worrisome,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything even close to this.\u201d\nAt Moody\u2019s, Zandi said he has hired a number of former BLS economists whom he called \u201cfantastic.\u201d\n\u201cThey do great work,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cThey are critical to a well-functioning economy.\u201d\nDemocratic Virginia Senator Mark Warner accused Trump of working the referees.\n\u201cFiring the ump doesn\u2019t change the score,\u201d Warner said in a statement. \u201cAmericans deserve to know the truth about the state of the Trump economy.\u201d\nBut Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a post on social media that she supports replacing McEntarfer.\n\u201cA recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,\u201d Chavez-DeRemer said on X. \u201cI support the President\u2019s decision to replace Biden\u2019s Commissioner and ensure the American People can trust the important and influential data coming from BLS.\u201d\nConcerns about cuts\nThe BLS jobs survey is widely considered by economists to be robust. It samples more than 100,000 businesses and government agencies each month, representing roughly 629,000 individual worksites.\nBut, as part of larger cost-cutting taking place around practically every part of Trump\u2019s government, the BLS is laying off staff \u2014 and, as a result, reducing the scope of its work.\nFor example, the BLS posted a notice in June stating it stopped collecting data for its Consumer Price Index in three cities (Lincoln, Nebraska; Buffalo, New York; and Provo, Utah) and increased \u201cimputations\u201d for certain items (a statistical technique that, when boiled down to very rough terms, essentially means more educated guesses).\nThat worried Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. In testimony before Congress in June, Powell said he believed the BLS data to be accurate, but he was upset about what could become a trend.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019m concerned about the data today, although there has been a very mild degradation of the scope of the surveys,\u201d Powell said at the time, in response to a question about survey data quality. \u201cBut I would say the direction of travel is something I\u2019m concerned about.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and context."

Traders now expect an 85% chance of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve in September, up from a 38% chance on Thursday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nThe unemployment rate rose to 4.2% from 4.1%.\nTariffs are \u2018paralyzing\u2019 employers\nHigh uncertainty over Trump\u2019s economic policies \u2014 specifically a volatile trade policy and shifting tariff rates \u2014 have been blamed for putting a stranglehold on employers\u2019 growth plans.\n\u201cTariffs and uncertainty are paralyzing employers,\u201d Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CNN in an interview.\nEconomists were expecting the report to show a slowdown in job growth, reflecting the weak pace of hiring across the vast majority of industries.\nForecasts called for a gain of 115,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate to rise to 4.2%.\nHowever, economists weren\u2019t expecting the past three months to be this frail.\n\u201cThis (jobs report) is really bad because you can see the impact of trade and immigration policy hurting demand for hiring,\u201d Brusuelas said.\nHe noted that goods-producing industries lost 13,000 jobs, with 11,000 of those losses coming in manufacturing and construction posting weak gains of 2,000 jobs.\n\u201cThese trends reflect the ripple effects of trade and immigration policies impacting labor supply, especially where migrant workers are key,\u201d he added.\nIn recent months, despite the labor market registering solid (but slower) gains, economists were sounding some alarm bells: The all-important labor market churn was grinding to a halt, and a smaller and smaller subset of industries was responsible for the job gains.\nThat lack of breadth was wildly apparent in July: Health care and social assistance, which added 73,300 jobs, accounted for the entirety of the month\u2019s overall gains.\n\u201cThere was a three-legged stool holding up the labor market; we had state and local, leisure and hospitality, and health care and social assistance,\u201d Swonk said. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re down to one.\u201d\n\u201cA one-legged stool is dangerous,\u201d she added.\nLeisure and hospitality, which typically sees a summertime boom, added a meager 5,000 jobs in July. June\u2019s gains were revised down to 4,000, BLS data shows.\n\u201cThat\u2019s almost within the margin of error,\u201d Swonk said. \u201cThat reflects a slowdown in domestic travel and tourism.\u201d\nState and local government posted a meek 2,000-job net gain in July. And June\u2019s initially reported 80,000-job gain \u2014 which economists warned was likely an \u201cartificial\u201d increase that resulted from seasonal adjustments \u2014 was revised down to 20,000 jobs.\nAnd as for that labor market churn (or lack there of), Friday\u2019s jobs report showed that the average duration of unemployment rose to 24.1 weeks (north of six months), the lengthiest average span in more than three years.\nWhy is the jobs data revised?\nThe US labor force is shrinking. It\u2019s done so for three months in a row now, and in July, the unemployment rate rose as a result.\nThe civilian labor force is the denominator in the unemployment rate calculation (with the number of out-of-work job seekers being the numerator), so that\u2019s helped to push up the overall unemployment rate.\nBut before delving into labor market dynamics, it\u2019s worth stepping back and highlighting some of the nitty-gritty about how the jobs report is structured.\nThe BLS\u2019 monthly snapshot of the labor market is composed of two surveys: One of households (which provides demographic data and feeds into the all-important unemployment rate) and the other of businesses (designed to measure employment, hours and earnings).\nThe household survey, which provides demographic data and feeds into the unemployment rate, is considered more volatile because of its smaller sample size and declining response rates. The establishment survey is responsible for the monthly estimates of how many jobs were added or lost.\nIt\u2019s important to note the \u201cestimates\u201d part of this: It is a survey after all, albeit a fairly robust one (the BLS surveys well north of 100,000 businesses and government agencies, representing roughly 629,000 individual worksites).\nWhen the market-moving jobs report is released, that initial estimate is often based on incomplete data and thus will be revised twice further in the two jobs reports that follow as the BLS receives more complete information from businesses.\nBut then it\u2019s eventually revised even further: The bigger, annual revision (which takes place each February jobs report) will come into focus starting next month when the preliminary annual benchmarking estimates are released.\nAnd, also keep in mind that the estimates seen in the jobs reports are adjusted to smooth out seasonal changes (think: construction jobs pick up in spring, schools are out for the summer). The adjustments anticipate a certain number of job losses or gains, so if the employment gains or losses fall outside those expectations, it can result in bigger or smaller employment gains.\nThe statistical refinements help smooth out the data to better understand underlying trends. These adjustments anticipate a certain number of job losses to start the year, so if fewer workers get let go than anticipated, that can result in bigger overall employment gains (and vice versa).\nWarning signs flashing\nKeeping the above context in mind, there were several potential warning signs in the July jobs report:\nBlack unemployment in America hit 7.2%, its highest level since October 2021.\nA rise in the Black unemployment rate almost always precedes the rise in the general population unemployment rate. That\u2019s because a higher percentage of Black Americans than Americans of other races are in temporary jobs or lower-income jobs that tend to be the first that employers cut when they grow concerned about the economy.\nThe labor force shrank for the third month in a row, which is the first time since 2011, according to Appcast economist Sam Kuhn. And the labor force participation rate fell to 62.2%, the lowest since November 2022.\nThe fall could be caused in part by stepped-up immigration enforcement; however, other factors such as an aging workforce, highly discouraged workers, and \u201csimply mismeasurement\u201d from lower response rates to the household survey could be factoring in to that equation, said Preston Caldwell, Morningstar\u2019s chief economist.\nThe foreign-born labor force has declined in recent months. In addition to the household survey response rate and volatility caveats, this one comes with another: Given the rhetoric and actions around immigration enforcement, workers (undocumented or not) are likely disinclined to share details about their immigration backgrounds with the federal government, Oliver Allen, Pantheon Macroeconomics\u2019 senior US economist, told CNN in a recent interview.\nEconomists warn that a shrinking labor force and fewer foreign-born workers could put upward pressure on wages (and inflation), and result in hiring challenges for key industries and negative supply chain impacts as a result.\nThe 253,000 downward revisions to May and June was the largest since at least 1979 (with the exception of 2020), according to Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale.\nThe outsized correction is reflective of an extremely volatile economic environment, KPMG\u2019s Swonk said. \u201cThe data was meant for historic norms for an economy that typically moves more slowly.\u201d\nAll told, the July report showed a \u201cweaker underbelly for the US economy,\u201d said Daco.\n\u201cThis type of very weak job growth momentum is essentially eroding the economy\u2019s buffer against headwinds,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd and in an environment where the US economy is subject to historic supply shocks, that will essentially expose it to the risk of a recession.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Matt Egan and David Goldman contributed to this report."

      "text": "Economists, researchers and analysts have warned that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping trade policy of tacking steep tariffs on most goods that come into America will deliver a taxing blow to consumers via higher prices.\nHowever, recent months\u2019 economic data has shown that overall inflation has remained fairly tame.\nTrump and members of his administration tout the positive economic reports as signs that tariffs are working. However, the chorus of concern is growing: Prices are moving higher, and economists say this is just the beginning.\nHere\u2019s a look at the mechanisms behind why price hikes, and hotter inflation, are a slow burn:\nTariffs have been applied in a staggered manner: The earliest tariffs went into effect in February (China, non-USMCA goods) and March (steel, aluminum), but the bulk were not announced or applied until April or later.\nTrade policy and tariffs are in flux: There have been plenty of instances where announced tariffs have been postponed, suddenly nixed, or unexpectedly increased or decreased in size.\nShipping takes time: Sea cargo shipments can take weeks to more than a month to reach the US from other countries.\nDomestic supply chains take time, too: Once goods land on US soil, they don\u2019t hit shelves the very next day. In addition to domestic transport times, the imported products (which are not always finished goods but rather parts and materials) have to still go through the manufacturing and production processes before being distributed to sales channels.\nInventories were loaded up before tariffs hit: Near the end of last year, businesses frontloaded import orders to prepare for any disruptions that could come from a massive, and short-lived East and Gulf Coast port strike and also to get ahead of potential tariffs. Those stockpiling efforts surged this year as steep \u2014 and unexpectedly expansive \u2014 tariffs came into view and during periods in which they were postponed or lessened.\nSome costs are being eaten: First, foreign exporters are absorbing some of the added costs. A Goldman Sachs analysis puts that share at about 20%, meaning that the remaining 80% of higher costs from tariffs (which are added to the price of wholesale goods when they hit US soil) have been split between US businesses and US consumers. Goldman Sachs economists expect that eventually about 70% of the direct cost of tariffs will be passed onto consumers through higher prices. (However, that 70% could move higher, depending on how much domestic producers change their prices as well, according to the analysis).\nBusinesses are hesitant to pass on higher prices: Consumers, hammered for years by a bout of high inflation, don\u2019t have the appetite \u2014 or the savings \u2014 for higher prices. \u201cFirms\u2019 pricing power is just getting a little weakened because consumer spending is starting to soften,\u201d Nicole Cervi, a Wells Fargo economist, told CNN.\nAwareness of goods prices is lower in summer than fall and winter: The US is a service-heavy economy, especially in the summertime, when spending is directed more at travel, recreation and leisure. However, some goods prices are already on the rise, and companies are warning more are on the way. However, goods will play a more central role in household budgets come fall and winter, when back-to-school season and spendy holidays such as Halloween and Christmas hit. \u201cI think some of this might become more real for people\u201d later this year, said Tyler Schipper, associate professor in economics and data analysis at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota.\nEconomic data is often lagged: Next week, for example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release critical inflation data that covers the month of June.\nInflation indices are comprehensive: Rising goods prices are showing up in the inflation data; however, they\u2019ve largely been overshadowed by factors such as falling gas prices and a continued slowing of price hikes for services, particularly rent and housing. As such, inflation data to this point has remained fairly muted \u2014 for now.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that tariff effects have not shown up strongly in official consumer prices yet,\u201d according to a Goldman Sachs\u2019 July 8 note.\nPrices are already rising, inflation is at a \u2018turning point\u2019\nHowever, the seemingly muted headline inflation numbers don\u2019t tell the full story: Goods prices \u2014 particularly in tariff-exposed categories \u2014 are already on the rise, both private-sector and federal data shows.\nThe May Consumer Price Index showed that several tariff-sensitive categories saw price increases:\n- The price of appliances rose by 0.8% in both April and May, the highest monthly increase in nearly four years.\n- Toy prices climbed for the second consecutive month, leaping by 1.3% (matching a four-year high).\n- Household furnishings, tools and sporting goods showed an acceleration in price hikes after post-Covid years when prices fell.\nA DataWeave analysis of 200,000 products on 13 major US e-commerce sites show that prices have risen since January:\n- Home and furniture prices have accelerated for the past five months as compared to January: up 1.1% in February, 2.1% in March, 2.8% in April, 3.7% in May and 4.7% in June.\n- Toys showed a similar trajectory, but on a smaller scale: Prices were up 3.8% in June versus January.\n- Apparel and footwear prices were fairly flat in February through May but shot a little higher in June, up 1.7% from January.\n- Some price hikes are even greater at some retailers: For example, toys at Walmart and Target were up 7.4% and 6.1% from January, versus the average increase of 3.8%, respectively.\n\u201cThe percentage changes are definitely higher than what we\u2019ve seen in previous years,\u201d Karthik Bettadapura, co-founder and CEO of DataWeave, told CNN in an interview.\nIn June 2024, for example, home and furniture prices were up 1.9% from January, toy prices were up 0.4%, and apparel and footwear were up 0.7%, DataWeave data shows.\nBettadapura said he anticipates a further and broader \u201cprice creep\u201d in the coming months as tariffs ripple through the supply chain. And given ongoing pushback on higher prices, he expects there also to be a rise in shrinkflation (where brands may trim package sizes) and private-label expansion.\nThe June CPI, due out next week, also is expected to be the \u201cturning point\u201d where the steeply higher effective tariff rate will make a bigger mark on overall inflation, said Wells Fargo\u2019s Cervi, noting expected gains in the closely watched core goods category (which excludes gas and food).\n\u201cThe core goods side will start to leg up higher because of this tariff pass-through starting to take effect,\u201d she said.\nWells Fargo expects that the overall CPI could peak at 2.9% later this year (in part because of the further disinflationary effects from the services side).\nBut even if inflationary impacts are \u201cmodest,\u201d the effects on Americans could cut deeper, said Schipper, from the University of St. Thomas.\n\u201cRight now, I am less concerned about inflation building on itself,\u201d Schipper said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a cost to consumers that are struggling.\u201d"

      "text": "President Donald Trump claimed without evidence that the massive revisions to the latest jobs report constituted a \u201cscam,\u201d accusing one of the top overseers of government statistics of cooking the books in a vendetta against his presidency.\n\u201cIn my opinion, today\u2019s Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad,\u201d Trump said in a message on Truth Social Friday.\nAs a result, he fired Dr. Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nTrump, in a message posted to Truth Social Sunday, incorrectly claimed McEntarfer \u201chad the biggest miscalculations in over 50 years.\u201d In fact, the revisions the BLS made to recent jobs reports were neither historic nor evidence of corruption.\nWhat is the BLS?\nEstablished in 1884, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is an independently operated body within the US Department of Labor. The Labor Secretary, a member of the president\u2019s cabinet, has oversight of the BLS, but it is run by a Senate-appointed commissioner.\nThe BLS collects data on a number of key economic concerns and produces critical reports on a regular basis. Those include data on prices, inflation, productivity, spending, pay, workplace injuries, employment and unemployment.\nMore than 2,000 people work for the BLS, including a number of professional economists and survey takers who regularly contact businesses and employees. The economists analyze the data and produce reports for the public and the government.\nHow does the BLS collect jobs data?\nThe BLS collects jobs data in two separate surveys. The first is done in part with old-fashioned door knocking. Survey takers go home to home throughout the country asking people for their employment status and their demographic information.\nA second survey, known as the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey, is collected from thousands of businesses and government agencies using a variety of methods: via telephone, internet surveys, and \u2013 for large corporations \u2013 through an automated data transfer. By law, participation in the CES survey is voluntary, but state laws in New Mexico, Oregon and South Carolina require businesses to produce data for the survey. A law in Puerto Rico also requires the territory\u2019s businesses to submit data to the BLS.\nCES survey respondents submit monthly employment, hours, and earnings data for all paid workers to the BLS from their payroll records. The data is collected for the pay period that includes the 12th of the month.\nWhat does the BLS do to the data?\nBLS economists first edit the data to detect processing and reporting errors. If mistakes are detected, BLS employees contact the business for clarification.\nThen, BLS staff prepare the data for a monthly report by estimating America\u2019s employment, hours worked and earnings. To extrapolate the data for the entire country, BLS economists add in some educated guesswork, based on seasonal hiring trends. The BLS also smooths out the data with calculations known as seasonal adjustments to avoid huge spikes and dips in data each month.\nThe BLS also protects the raw data and its estimates by processing them through statistical tests, so individuals can\u2019t gain access to any particular employer\u2019s data.\nWhat is in the BLS\u2019 jobs report?\nEvery month, typically on the first Friday, the BLS produces its Employment Situation Summary, known colloquially as the monthly US jobs report.\nThe report is generated from the two surveys: The household survey provides demographic data and the unemployment rate. The business survey provides data on pay, hours worked, and the number of jobs the US economy added or subtracted.\nIn addition to that particular month\u2019s jobs information, the report also revises up or down the previous two months\u2019 jobs totals.\nWhy is that data revised?\nThe BLS considers its initial jobs numbers to be preliminary when they\u2019re first published, because some respondents fail to report their payroll data by the BLS\u2019 deadline. Low survey responses can make the report more challenging to estimate. But the BLS continues to collect the payroll data as it\u2019s reported, and it revises the data accordingly.\nThe data are also revised because of the seasonal adjustments. If the more complete data comes in well above or below the preliminary data, revisions can be exacerbated by the BLS\u2019 seasonal adjustments, which sometimes need to be recalculated.\nThe data is revised several times: in each of the two months following the initial report, and then a preliminary annual revision in August and a final annual revision in February.\nWere recent revisions abnormal?\nThe July report, issued Friday, included revisions for May and June that were historically large, but they were not unprecedented.\nMay\u2019s jobs total was revised lower to 19,000, down from an initial estimate of 139,000 \u2013 a total revision of 120,000 jobs. For the June jobs total, the BLS on Friday said the US economy added just 14,000 jobs, down from a preliminary estimate of 147,000 \u2013 a revision of 133,000 jobs.\nThe BLS tracks each month\u2019s revisions dating back to 1979, but the BLS introduced a new probability-based sample design for revisions in 2003. Between 1979 and 2003, the average monthly revision was 61,000 jobs. Since 2003, the average monthly revision is only a slightly more accurate 51,000 jobs.\nBut you don\u2019t need to look so far back to find larger revisions than the ones the BLS reported over May and June. In 2020 and 2021, jobs numbers were all over the map because of the pandemic: Revisions in four months during those years were bigger than the revisions from last month\u2019s report \u2013 including the largest-ever 679,000-job revision in March 2020, attributed to particularly poor survey responses during a nationwide lockdown.\nThere have been bigger revisions outside of the pandemic, too, including a 143,000-job revision in January 2009.\nHas Trump complained about other data?\nTrump has complained about a preliminary annual revision that was issued in August 2024, that showed the US economy had added 818,000 fewer jobs over the past year than previously reported. Trump in a Truth Social post on Friday incorrectly called that revision a \u201crecord\u201d: A 902,000-job revision in 2009 was larger. And the final 2024 revision, issued in February, showed that the 2024 data was overestimated by 589,000 jobs. The BLS said the difference between the initial and final annual revisions was due to information received in US tax returns.\nTrump also correctly noted on Friday the the BLS revised lower initial jobs totals in August and September 2024 by a combined 112,000 positions before last year\u2019s presidential election. But that revision was not out of the ordinary \u2013 several revisions were larger earlier in the year and in previous years. And October\u2019s jobs numbers, reported just days before the election, constituted the worst month for jobs since the pandemic.\nWho uses the BLS\u2019 data?\nMany businesses and government organizations rely on the BLS data for their decision-making about investment, pay and hiring decisions. The Federal Reserve, in particular, relies on the BLS data to help guide its monetary policy and rate-setting.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week said the entire economy relies on strong data.\n\u201cGood data helps not just the Fed, it helps the government, but also helps the private sector,\u201d Powell said at a press conference last week. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to accurately capture in real time the output of a $20-plus trillion economy, and the United States has been a leader in that for 100 years, and we really need to continue that, in my view.\u201d\nIn June, Powell told Congress he was concerned about the \u201ctrajectory\u201d of weaker data.\nIn addition to the Fed and the private sector, the BLS notes its survey data is used by the National Bureau of Economic Research to determine whether or not the economy is in a recession. It\u2019s used by the Conference Board to produce economic indexes that help companies better understand the current business cycle. And it helps the BLS produce several other reports about jobs and the economy throughout the year.\nCan other data replace the BLS\u2019 report?\nAlternatives to the BLS data have proven limited. Payroll processing company ADP produces a monthly private payrolls report that fails to capture government hiring and is notoriously out of sync with the BLS report. Its inconsistencies have led economists to largely ignore the report.\nOther surveys, such as a layoffs report from outsourcing and placement services firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, is sometimes instructive but far less robust than the BLS report.\nThe BLS report has its challenges too. For example, the household survey that includes the monthly unemployment rate and demographic data is considered rather volatile because of its smaller sample size and declining response rates. But the business and government employment survey is widely considered by economists to be the gold standard.\n\u201cBLS is the finest statistical agency in the entire world, it\u2019s numbers are trusted all over the world,\u201d former Commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics William Beach told Kasie Hunt on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday.\n\u201cI do believe, though, that the president\u2019s attack on the commissioner and on the bureau is undermining that infrastructure, could undermine that trust over the long term,\u201d he added."

      "text": "The Consumer Price Index is more than just the most widely used inflation gauge and a measurement of Americans\u2019 purchasing power.\nIts robust data plays a key role in the US economy\u2019s trajectory as well as monthly mortgage payments, Social Security checks, financial aid packages, business contracts, pay negotiations and curiosity salves for those who wonder what Kevin McCallister\u2019s $19.83 grocery bill in \u201cHome Alone\u201d might cost today.\nHowever, this gold standard piece of economic data has become a little less precise recently: The Bureau of Labor Statistics posted a notice on Wednesday stating that it stopped collecting data in three not-so-small cities (Lincoln, Nebraska; Buffalo, New York; and Provo, Utah) and increased \u201cimputations\u201d for certain items (a statistical technique that, when boiled down to very rough terms, essentially means more educated guesses).\nThe BLS notice states that the collection reductions \u201cmay increase the volatility of subnational or item-specific indexes\u201d and are expected to have \u201cminimal impact\u201d on the overall index.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s drastic cutbacks of government spending and the federal workforce have economists, researchers and statisticians sounding the alarm that the reliability and accuracy of economic data could become a casualty to those efforts.\n\u201cThe BLS\u2019s need to infer more data points due to personnel and funding constraints is deeply concerning,\u201d Gregory Daco, EY-Parthenon\u2019s chief economist, told CNN. \u201cIt raises legitimate questions about the reliability and timeliness of critical economic indicators.\u201d\nWhile statistical agencies often have protocols to maintain data quality during short disruptions, any sustained underfunding could \u201cdegrade the foundational data used for policymaking, market analysis and business planning,\u201d he said.\nBLS officials did not respond to questions posed by CNN and instead referred to the notice and related links on response rates and collections.\nIn the early days of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term in office, federal websites went dark and data disappeared as the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency set its sights on streamlining the government. That further heightened concerns as to whether the nation\u2019s statistical infrastructure \u2014 which already has been in a precarious state in terms of funding, response rates and public trust \u2014 was at risk of crumbling.\nTrump\u2019s fiscal 2026 budget proposal includes an 8% reduction to BLS funding and staffing.\nTo what extent the CPI reductions are a sign of what\u2019s to come remains to be seen; but the immediate impacts to inflation readings could be minimal for now, Alan Detmeister, a UBS senior economist who previously helmed the Fed\u2019s Wages and Prices section, told CNN.\n\u201cTheir statement said that this will have little impact on the aggregate index, which is quite possible; but up to this point, they have not put out enough information that we would need to really evaluate \u2014 we don\u2019t have any numbers on how [the reductions] are distributed, except for a few locations they stopped sampling,\u201d he said.\nThe reductions likely won\u2019t affect the long-run increases or decreases in inflation and, because of that, don\u2019t seem to be politically motivated, he added.\n\u201cWhat it does mean is that since they\u2019re using fewer observations, there\u2019s likely to be a little bit more noise in the monthly CPI data,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much more noise? We don\u2019t really know.\u201d\nDetmeister flagged the imputations anomalies in a note to clients earlier this week, noting that the share of imputed prices jumped 15% in March (the highest level since the pandemic rattled the economy in April 2020), and then surged even more in April, by 29%.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether the CPI has become less reliable, but what is certain is that any weirdness or hitches in the data is happening at a bad time, he added.\n\u201cAny time you\u2019re using fewer observations, it creates a bit of an issue; the real concern is if these types of surprises continue to occur, and the number of observations continues to be reduced,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you see it occurring in other statistics as well, it just makes our view of what\u2019s going on in the economy slightly worse.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re really scrutinizing all the price data every month to see if there are impacts of the tariffs coming through; so, the timing isn\u2019t ideal.\u201d\nThe CPI for May will be released Wednesday next week."
