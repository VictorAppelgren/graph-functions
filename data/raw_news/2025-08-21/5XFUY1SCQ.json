  "title": "Rayner hit with net zero legal challenge over \u00a31bn data centre",
  "description": "Environmental activists argue the Deputy Prime Minister is imperilling climate goals",
  "content": "Angela Rayner is facing a legal battle with green activists over plans for a \u00a31bn data centre on the edge of the M25.\n\nCampaigners have challenged a decision by the Deputy Prime Minister to wave through a twice-rejected data centre project in Iver, Buckinghamshire, arguing that there had been no proper environmental impact assessment.\n\nActivists from the non-profit group Foxglove and environmental group Global Action Plan claimed Ms Rayner\u2019s decision would imperil climate goals. They also argued that the process was unlawful and broke planning regulations.\n\n\u201cData centres are extremely resource intensive, requiring a large amount of power and water to operate,\u201d they said in a legal letter seen by The Telegraph. \u201cThe intensity of the anticipated resource usage is likely to have a significant environmental effect.\u201d\n\nOliver Hayes, of Global Action Plan, said AI data centres threatened \u201cprecious local resources and the planet\u201d. He added: \u201cAre the societal benefits of chatbots and deepfakes really worth sacrificing progress towards a safe climate and dependable water supply?\u201d\n\nMs Rayner approved the 775,000 sq ft Buckinghamshire project in July as part of a drive by Sir Keir Starmer to boost the UK\u2019s flagging growth with a data centre building blitz.\n\nThe project was rejected last year by Buckinghamshire council. An earlier attempt to redevelop the site was blocked in 2023 by Michael Gove, the Conservative former housing minister.\n\nHowever, Matthew Pennycook, the current planning minister, stepped in to overrule the prior decisions and approve the project.\n\nActing on behalf of Ms Rayner, Mr Pennycook said there was no need for an environmental review and warned that \u201c\u00a31bn investment would or could be lost to the UK\u201d if the scheme was rejected.\n\n\u201cGiven the increasingly sluggish state of the UK economy, an investment in excess of \u00a31bn is of huge importance,\u201d the decision said.\n\nMs Rayner has used her powers to wave through multiple data centres since Labour took office, despite the objections of local authorities and warnings that data centres threaten Britain\u2019s net zero targets and strain local resources.\n\nRosa Curling, of Foxglove, said: \u201cLocal people will soon be competing with a power guzzling-behemoth to keep the lights on.\u201d\n\nIn the Government\u2019s decision, it rejected a local planning inspector\u2019s assessment that the land at Iver, a disused landfill site overshadowed by the M25, was \u201ctranquil and calm\u201d.\n\nGreystoke Land, the Iver site\u2019s developer, has said the area is \u201cideally positioned on the UK\u2019s long-haul fibre network\u201d and suggested the 90 megawatt (MW) data centre would create 230 jobs.\n\nA spokesman for Greystoke said: \u201cModern data centres play a key role in advancing scientific research, medical diagnostics and sustainable energy.\n\n\u201cThe data centre campus incorporates measures which benefit the environment, including appropriate building standards, solar panels and heat pumps. The Secretary of State took all relevant matters into account and reached the right decision.\u201d\n\nTech giants are spending tens of billions of pounds on new data centre infrastructure and energy projects across the world to power artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Sir Keir has identified AI as a key area of focus for the UK economy, with plans to make the country a hub for processing power through large-scale data centre construction.",
