  "description": "President Donald Trump and his economic advisers are planning a historic sale of stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-owned mortgage giants that help provide stability and affordability to America\u2019s home loan market.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump and his economic advisers are planning a historic sale of stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-owned mortgage giants that help provide stability and affordability to America\u2019s home loan market.\n\nThe plans, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, have not yet been finalized, and Trump continues to weigh various options, according to a senior administration official. But the White House believes an initial public offering of up to 15% of the two companies\u2019 shares could raise $30 billion, which could make it the largest IPO in history.\n\nThe president has been weighing an IPO for years. Trump\u2019s first administration tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to privatize Fannie and Freddie from the government conservatorship. But Trump has renewed his effort in his second term. In May, he posted on Truth Social that he was \u201cgiving very serious consideration to bringing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public.\u201d He said would consult with cabinet members and make a decision \u201cin the near future.\u201d\n\nTrump has met with various Wall Street bank CEOs in recent weeks, including JPMorgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon, Goldman Sachs\u2019 David Solomon and, this week, Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan, with whom Trump discussed a potential Fannie and Freddie IPO, according to a source familiar with their discussions.\n\nMany of Trump\u2019s allies in the Republican Party have long advocated for ending the government conservatorship that Fannie and Freddie were placed under during 2008 global financial crisis. The conservatorship ensured their survival during the housing crisis that precipitated the Great Recession, but government control of the two entities was intended to be temporary.\n\nProponents say the companies are viable on their own, and returning Fannie and Freddie to the public could help raise money for a government that is flooded with debt.\n\nBut some economists have warned that attempts to privatize Fannie and Freddie could upset the balance in the mortgage market, making it even more expensive for Americans to borrow money to purchase a home. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, estimated in 2024 that privatization could cost the typical American taking out a new mortgage between $1,800 and $2,800 per year.\n\nCritics have also noted that Fannie and Freddie have enormous backing from hedge fund investors, so much of the proceeds of an IPO would go to wealthy financial backers, not taxpayers.\n\nThe companies guarantee 70% of America\u2019s mortgages. Although they don\u2019t issue mortgages to borrowers, Fannie and Freddie help ensure America\u2019s housing market functions properly: They buy mortgages from lenders and repackage them for investors, helping money flow in and out of the housing market.\n\nFannie and Freddie are both instrumental in making 30-year mortgages possible \u2013 and relatively affordable (although rates have surged in recent years for a variety of reasons).\n\nAn IPO would return Fannie and Freddie to their pre-2008 state, when they were publicly traded companies backed by the US Treasury. They were placed under government control on September 7, 2008, after facing massive losses amid crashing home values. A week later, Lehman Brothers collapsed, sparking a global financial crisis.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he soon planned to decide whether to privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that help provide stability and affordability to America\u2019s home mortgage market.\n\u201cI am giving very serious consideration to bringing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public,\u201d Trump posted on his social media website, Truth Social, on Wednesday, saying he would consult with cabinet members and make a decision \u201cin the near future.\u201d\n\u201cFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are doing very well, throwing off a lot of CASH, and the time would seem to be right,\u201d the post said.\nBut at a time when mortgage rates remain stubbornly high and home prices keep climbing, some economists have warned that attempts at privatizing Fannie and Freddie could upset the balance in the mortgage market, making it even more expensive for Americans to borrow money to purchase a home.\nMany of Trump\u2019s allies in the Republican Party have long advocated for ending the government conservatorship that Fannie and Freddie were placed under after their role in the 2008 global financial crisis. Government control of the two entities was intended to be temporary.\nIn fact, Trump attempted to untangle Fannie and Freddie from US government control in 2019 during his first administration and failed.\nFannie and Freddie essentially grease the wheels of America\u2019s home lending market by buying mortgages from lenders and repackaging them for investors. This helps enable a reliable flow of money, allowing mortgage lenders to offer more affordable mortgage rates to would-be homebuyers.\nMany experts credit the two entities with helping to prop up the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the most popular type of home loan in the US due to its relatively low monthly payments compared to shorter-term loans.\nBefore 2008, Fannie and Freddie were private companies, backed by the US Treasury \u2013 though both were originally created by the government. They were placed under government control on September 7, 2008, after facing massive losses amid crashing home values that ignited the Great Recession. A week later, Lehman Brothers collapsed, sparking a global financial crisis.\nPrivatizing Fannie and Freddie could spook the investors who buy up mortgage loans, leading them to demand a higher return for their investments and pushing up mortgage rates, experts warn.\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, estimated in 2024 that privatization could cost the typical American taking out a new mortgage between $1,800 and $2,800 per year.\nFannie and Freddie are currently controlled by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which has been run by William Pulte since his confirmation in March. At that time, Pulte told CNN that any effort to privatize Fannie and Freddie would need to include \u201csignificant study\u201d on what the effort might do to mortgage rates.\nThat may take a few years. In a note to clients on Wednesday, TD Cowen financial services and housing policy analyst Jaret Seiberg said he did not expect the Trump administration to attempt a spin-off until late 2026 or early 2027."

      "text": "The Trump administration is calling on federal agencies to draft plans to overhaul the nation\u2019s housing finance system, years after the US government seized the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday signed a memo directing the Treasury Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to develop both legislative and regulatory plans to revamp the two companies still under the government\u2019s control since the 2008 financial crisis, the White House said in a statement.\nTrump\u2019s directive calls for ending the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie and improve the federal government\u2019s regulatory oversight over them.\nThe Treasury Department will spearhead drafting a reform plan for the two companies, while HUD will design a separate regulatory protocol to oversee the housing finance agencies.\n\u201cThe housing finance system of the United States is in urgent need of reform,\u201d the President\u2019s memo read, which noted three White House priorities: reducing taxpayer risk, expanding the private sector\u2019s role and improving access to sustainable home ownership.\nThose plans should be delivered to the President \u201cas soon as practicable,\u201d the White House said in the statement.\nThe presidential memo comes as the Senate Banking Committee held two days of hearings on Capitol Hill on the viability of blueprint to reform the housing finance market. The proposal was introduced by Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Indiana, chairman of the panel, in February.\n\u201cI have long said that the status quo is not a viable option, and I consider it a top priority this Congress to find a comprehensive solution,\u201d said Crapo on Tuesday in his opening remarks at the hearing.\nA spokeswoman for the senator did not immediately respond to comment from CNN on the President\u2019s initiative.\nPolicy analysts were quick to note there were few signs of progress reform, a top priority for Crapo.\n\u201cNothing we heard \u2026 on reform of Fannie and Freddie convinced us that Congress is ready to act,\u201d wrote Jaret Seiberg, managing director at Cowen Washington Research Group, in a note to clients.\nFannie and Freddie, along with other government-insured mortgages, currently dominate the mortgage market with roughly 70% of all mortgages touched by the federal government.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has previously said he would prioritize working with Congress this year on a bipartisan basis to fix the government-sponsored enterprises and relinquish them from conservatorship.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the secretary endorsed the President\u2019s move, saying, \u201cWe support a system that provides for access to lending for hardworking Americans, while also protecting taxpayers from risk.\u201d\nAmong the criteria laid out in the presidential memo includes asking Treasury to craft a plan that would minimize risks to the financial system, provide that the federal government be \u201cproperly compensated\u201d for any explicit or implicit support it provides to the GSEs or the secondary mortgage market.\nTreasury\u2019s reform plan should also preserve homeowners access to 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, establish adequate capital and liquidity requirements for Fannie and Freddie and expand the private sector\u2019s share of the US mortgage market, among other factors. The White House is also asking the agency to specify whether each proposed reform would require approval from Congress or could be done administratively.\nThe President also asked HUD to prepare a list of its own reform proposals, including determining the benefits and risks tied to providing assistance to first-time homebuyers, including down payment assistance."

      "text": "A long-held stake by a handful of hedge funds may finally yield returns under the Trump administration, but it risks sending shockwaves through America\u2019s $12 trillion mortgage market.\nLast month, President Donald Trump said he had plans to take mortgage financing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public. Such a move would end 17 years of federal government conservatorship over the two companies, which have played a central role in America\u2019s housing finance system by providing liquidity to the mortgage market.\nSome experts warn that severing Fannie and Freddie from government control could raise mortgage rates and restrict access to popular mortgage products \u2014 like the 30-year fixed loan \u2014 at a time when housing affordability remains out of reach for many Americans. Last week, Senate Democrats sent a letter to William Pulte, who leads the Federal Housing Finance Agency, asking him to pause efforts to take the two public, citing the risk that it could increase costs for homebuyers.\nA group of investors has been anxiously awaiting the day Fannie and Freddie return to the public markets. None has been more vocal than billionaire investor Bill Ackman, whose hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital, is one of the largest holders of common shares in Fannie and Freddie.\n\u201cWe have been leading the charge on behalf of all (Fannie and Freddie) shareholders to help them to exit from conservatorship,\u201d Ackman posted on social media on Tuesday. A representative for Ackman pointed to his commentary on social media when asked about Pershing Square\u2019s current stake.\nAckman isn\u2019t the only hedge fund investor who bet on Fannie and Freddie after the government seized them during the 2008 financial crisis, when both were on the brink of collapse.\nOther investors, including billionaire hedge fund managers Carl Icahn and John Paulson, have previously disclosed stakes in Fannie and Freddie, though neither responded to CNN\u2019s request for information about the current size of their stakes.\nTaking the two mortgage giants public may be challenging, said Lori Goodman, a fellow at the Urban Institute, who has studied the history of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nTogether, Fannie and Freddie\u2019s total net worth is more than $150 billion. Goodman estimates any public offering of Fannie and Freddie shares would likely eclipse the largest IPO in history: state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco, which raised $26 billion when it went public in 2019.\n\u201cThis is an enormously complicated undertaking,\u201d she said.\nFannie and Freddie were never meant to permanently remain in a conservatorship arrangement, but Trump failed in an initial attempt to spin them off during his first administration.\nInvestors are wagering that his next try will be successful. Shares of Fannie (FNMA) and Freddie (FMCC), which trade over the counter, surged after Trump was elected in November. In the last year, shares of Fannie\u2019s stock are up nearly 500% and Freddie\u2019s gained nearly 400%.\nHomebuyers could pay more\nFannie and Freddie essentially grease the wheels of America\u2019s home lending market, one of the world\u2019s largest, by buying mortgages from lenders and repackaging them for investors. This helps enable a reliable flow of money to mortgage lenders, allowing them to offer more affordable rates to would-be homebuyers. Today, the mortgage giants guarantee more than half of America\u2019s mortgages, according to the FHFA.\nGoodman said she expects that any plan to take the companies public would lead to higher borrowing costs for homebuyers.\nThe risk is that spinning off Fannie and Freddie could unsettle investors without the assurance of a government backstop, like the one provided during the 2008 crisis. In response, lenders might demand higher rates, especially from lower-income borrowers.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a trillion-dollar mortgage-backed securities market, both single-family and multi-family, that they\u2019re a critical part of,\u201d Goodman said of Fannie and Freddie. \u201cYou can\u2019t tamper with the government guarantee without upsetting that huge market.\u201d\nLast month, Trump addressed the issue of the government\u2019s guarantee, writing on social media: \u201cI am working on TAKING THESE AMAZING COMPANIES PUBLIC, but I want to be clear, the U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES, and I will stay strong in my position on overseeing them as President.\u201d\nBut a social media post might not be enough to assure investors in the multitrillion-dollar mortgage-backed securities market, Goodman said. It is possible that Fannie and Freddie could pay a fee to assure the government\u2019s guarantee long-term, but that cost would also likely be passed on to homebuyers, she added.\nAny rise in mortgage rates would likely be unwelcome news to prospective homebuyers, who have been grappling with elevated borrowing costs since the Federal Reserve hiked its benchmark interest rate in 2022 to combat inflation. Mortgage rates, which track the 10-year Treasury yield, have recently been climbing again as growing concerns about the national debt and Trump\u2019s tariff policy have fueled fears of an economic slowdown.\nDemocrats have criticized the Trump administration\u2019s plans to overhaul Fannie and Freddie. Last week\u2019s letter to Pulte, the Federal Housing Finance Agency director, accused the Trump administration of being primarily motivated by \u201crewarding President Trump\u2019s billionaire campaign contributors.\u201d\n\u201cWe have serious concerns that you plan to make significant changes to the Enterprises in a way that would put investor profits over the homes of millions of Americans,\u201d Senate Democrats wrote in the letter.\nThere is also the question of whether it makes sense to release Fannie and Freddie into the public market in their current form, said Norbert Michel, a director at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\u201cThis system of privatized profit and socialized loss is what led to the 2008 crisis in the first place,\u201d Michel said. \u201cUnder no circumstances should they be released as they were prior.\u201d\n\u201cThat was a bad system. We should not have that system,\u201d he added.\nA risky trade\nIt remains unclear what exactly the Trump administration plans to do with Fannie and Freddie, which means it\u2019s also unclear whether hedge fund stakes, such as Ackman\u2019s, are worth anything at all.\nThat\u2019s because, as part of the conservatorship agreement, the US Treasury owns a preferential stake in Fannie and Freddie that takes priority over all other shareholders: Fannie and Freddie must pay back a $190 billion debt to the government for its bailout assistance before it can exit its conservatorship, which would prevent other shareholders from making a profit.\nAckman has advocated for the removal of the government\u2019s preferred shares, arguing that Fannie and Freddie have already paid back more money than it cost to bail them out. Since entering conservatorship, the two companies have paid $301 billion in dividends to the Treasury.\n\u201c(Fannie and Freddie) shareholders don\u2019t have their hands out. The opposite is the case,\u201d Ackman wrote last week on social media. \u201c(Fannie and Freddie) shareholders are simply seeking credit for payments that have already been made to the government so that a release from conservatorship can occur.\u201d\nBut financial analysts say investing in Fannie and Freddie is risky.\n\u201cAt the moment, on an economic basis, the private shareholders\u2019 equity is about negative $200 billion, because that is what Fannie and Freddie owe the government,\u201d said Bose George, a managing director at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a boutique investment banking company. \u201cOwning the shares is speculative because you\u2019re making an assumption that the government is going to forgive this debt.\u201d"
