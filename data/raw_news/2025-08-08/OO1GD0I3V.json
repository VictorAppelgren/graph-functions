  "description": "When was the last time you switched mobile carriers? A recent Android Authority poll has revealed some interesting results.",
  "content": "Colleague Joe Maring recently chronicled his switch from T-Mobile to Visible after ten years as a T-Mobile customer. He also revealed a few things he learned after a month with his new carrier, and it sounds like this was a long-overdue move.\n\nWe were curious to find out the last time our readers switched carriers, so we posted a poll. Almost 6,000 votes have been tallied, and here\u2019s what you told us!\n\nReader tracy.d.reynolds outlined their reasons for sticking with T-Mobile since the 1990s: I have been a T-Mobile customer since 1997 back when they started out as Powertel and it would take a lot to get me to move. I\u2019m under a very old government plan that I don\u2019t believe can be beat. I have 5 phones, one watch, 5G gateway for Internet and all the freebies T-Mobile gives away as Netflix, Apple TV and others from time to time and pay less than $200 per month with the go5G plus plan. I have never had an issue with T-Mobile customer service. They have always been there and fixed any issues I\u2019ve encountered which have been very few over the past 25+ years. The reception may not be the best across the country, but it\u2019s always been great wherever I am and wonderful when I travel abroad to Europe. I\u2019ll be hanging on with T-Mobile a while longer! Meanwhile, user jjbudzinski didn\u2019t reveal if or when they switched carriers, but explained why they\u2019ve stayed: We\u2019ve stuck with T-Mobile becuase they have free international data & texting around the world and my wife gets unlimited international calling for $15/month. This allows her to call family and friends, at $3/minute for most countries she needs to speak for just 5 minutes per month to pay for itself. She often talks for over an hour per month on a regular phone call \u2013 no data usage needed. Almost 18% of respondents said they last switched carriers five or more years ago, while 17.2% said they switched networks one to three years ago. Even if you combine these two figures, it\u2019s still clear that more surveyed readers last switched carriers 10+ years ago.\n\nUser anthonysr44 said he switched to Google Fi in the last few years: I had switched from T mobile to Google Fi a few years ago and I\u2019m glad I did. There was no change in my service whatsoever and everything was much cheaper. Meanwhile, reader alyson003 was a former Sprint subscriber who made a switch last year: I was a Sprint customer for 20 years, then the t-mobile merger happened. Nothing but a nightmare for 2 years dealing with them and trying to get my billing straight. My coverage was also terrible. Switched to Visible last year, saved $100 a month and have not missed that crummy company one bit. Otherwise, 12.2% of polled readers said they \u201crecently\u201d switched, while 7.94% said they switched in the last few months. Finally, ~2% chose the \u201cother\u201d option. I\u2019m guessing some of the people who chose this option haven\u2019t switched at all.\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s clear that six out of 10 respondents haven\u2019t switched carriers in the last five years or more. I\u2019m guessing most of you who voted this way are happy with the service, or aren\u2019t so unhappy that they want to leave. However, I\u2019d still suggest that you look at other carriers to make sure you aren\u2019t missing out on a great deal. Then again, colleague Andrew Grush has a list of carriers he doesn\u2019t recommend. Me? I haven\u2019t switched carriers in just over a decade, but that\u2019s mainly because I\u2019m too lazy to do so.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nAs a cell phone expert, these are the 5 carriers I don't recommend\nAugust 3, 2025\nI\u2019ve spent a significant portion of the past few years reporting on and testing various wireless service providers operating in the US market. As you might imagine, this has allowed me to form clear recommendations for just about every need \u2014 family plans, customer service, pricing, and more.\nConsidering postpaid and prepaid options together, there are dozens of choices available, yet only a handful of providers truly stand out enough to recur regularly in my recommendations. Some carriers are excluded because they don\u2019t offer anything unique enough, others because they simply target too narrow of a niche.\nAfter digging into reader comments on my coverage and Android Authority\u2019s mobile service content in general, I noticed certain brands were frequently mentioned, with readers wondering why they were left out. Indeed, some carriers can be useful in specific situations but don\u2019t often make mainstream recommendation lists due to limited appeal.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at a few commonly mentioned alternatives that I typically don\u2019t highlight, examining who they\u2019re for and whether you\u2019re better off skipping them.\nBoost Mobile\nI remember a comment in my best US carrier guide earlier this year asking why Boost Mobile doesn\u2019t get more attention from us, or really from the media in general.\nI understand the confusion. On paper, Boost sounds appealing, with unlimited plans starting as low as $25 per month and premium postpaid options offering yearly flagship upgrades for iPhones or Galaxy devices at just $65 monthly. These prices significantly undercut Verizon, AT&T, or T-Mobile. However, looking deeper reveals issues.\nOne challenge is Boost\u2019s unclear identity. While it now operates as a genuine postpaid provider with prepaid options, many still associate it with its budget prepaid legacy. Beyond perception, network consistency is a major concern.\nBoost sounds great on paper, but the reality is often not as appealing.\nBoost has its own 5G network through Dish Network, but coverage outside these areas depends entirely on rivals like AT&T and T-Mobile. Coverage inconsistencies result from differing SIM card options based on Dish\u2019s native reach and various roaming agreements. Consequently, Boost Mobile can be hit or miss. For some, it offers great savings; for others, it\u2019s a significant downgrade.\nWhile not generally recommended for just anyone, Boost can work well and save you a fortune if you live in a strong coverage area. If you\u2019re considering it, try a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) plan with a secondary number first. Why? Because it\u2019s much easier to leave this way if it doesn\u2019t work out. Upgrading phones locks you into Boost Mobile for a full year, longer than major competitors.\nInterested in learning more? You\u2019ll want to check out Boost Mobile\u2019s website.\nRedPocket Mobile\nSeveral readers have also asked about RedPocket Mobile in the past, but after taking a closer look, I\u2019ve found that for most users, it simply doesn\u2019t stand out much, and you\u2019re likely better off elsewhere.\nPricing ranges from $10 to $40 per month, or slightly less if you pay annually upfront. All plans advertise \u201cunlimited\u201d talk, text, and data, but premium data caps range from just 1GB to 50GB. Once you exceed that limit, speeds plummet to around 256Kbps, making even basic tasks painfully slow. Frankly, calling 1GB of data \u201cunlimited\u201d is misleading in today\u2019s usage environment.\nComparatively, RedPocket\u2019s cheapest plan (1GB for $10/month) matches poorly against Tello, which offers double the data at the same price. Its top-tier Elite plan, with 50GB data, hotspot, and Apple Watch support for $40, isn\u2019t terrible \u2014 but competitors like Visible offer even better international features and smartwatch support at roughly the same price. You\u2019ll find even cheaper options at US Mobile, with the 2GB Light Plan starting at just $10 a month or as low as $8 if paid annually.\nThe one notable feature is that RedPocket lets you choose from all three major networks, though even here, US Mobile offers the same flexibility with better execution, including the ability to use two networks simultaneously.\nAt the end of the day, RedPocket isn\u2019t a bad carrier and offers customer service that\u2019s no worse than any other budget provider, but there\u2019s rarely a compelling reason to choose it over the competition.\nInterested in learning more? You\u2019ll want to check out RedPocket Mobile\u2019s website.\nTracfone\nTracfone occasionally appears in the comments as well, though not nearly as much as the others. Once the king of burner phones, it\u2019s now much less popular. Smartphone plans start around $15 per month for 1GB, considerably pricier than competitors like US Mobile or Tello. In most cases, you\u2019ll generally receive a better experience with other Verizon value brands like Straight Talk.\nToday, Tracfone mainly serves those using basic phones as secondary devices \u2014 a shrinking market mostly consisting of older adults relying on landlines that look to cellphones only as an emergency device. For infrequent users, Tracfone can be affordable: for example, 365 days of service costs $125, including 1,500 minutes, 1,500 texts, and 1.5GB of data.\nInterested in learning more? You\u2019ll want to check out TracFone\u2019s website.\nHelium Mobile\nNow I actually have recommended Helium Mobile in a few pieces, but the truth is it\u2019s a pretty niche provider. For those who don\u2019t know, Helium Mobile runs on T-Mobile\u2019s network, but that\u2019s not its only claim to fame. The provider initially pushed itself as a crypto-carrier and leaned harder on its own Helium Network, but these days it feels a bit more like a typical prepaid carrier in reality.\nPlans for Helium range from free to $30 a month. If you have strong T-Mobile coverage and don\u2019t suffer from major congestion issues, you\u2019ll find Helium is a compelling choice that runs every bit as well as any other T-Mobile-based alternative.\nSo why don\u2019t I mention it more? First, the network is very much involved with crypto-technologies, its own network, reward partnerships, and other aspects that might be seen a positive for some but also make Helium slightly more questionable when it comes to privacy. It\u2019s also clear that mobile service isn\u2019t this company\u2019s first priority.\nThere are so many other brands out there with a more proven record in the mobile space, and unless that changes, it\u2019ll never be a common recommendation on my end. Still, if you find it works well for you, there\u2019s really nothing wrong with Helium. In fact, if you have a young kid or elderly family member who doesn\u2019t need much data, the free plan or the kids plan can be a great way to test them on their first phone without much risk.\nInterested in learning more? You\u2019ll want to check out Helium Mobile\u2019s website.\nTotal Wireless\nLast on the list is Total Wireless, which is another carrier that I admit doesn\u2019t get a recommendation from me very often. When I do recommend this carrier, it\u2019s usually to those with bigger families, as this is where Total shines.\nThis Verizon-owned brand has plans ranging from $40 to $60 a month for one line, but the pricing drops significantly as you add more lines. In fact, the best savings are triggered once you reach five lines, with even the most expensive plan only coming out to around $27 a month per line and the cheapest plan dropping to just $23 a month.\nAll three plans include truly unlimited data, though you\u2019ll need to get the Total 5G Unlimited or 5G Plus Unlimited plan if you want higher priority data that\u2019s similar to what you\u2019d get with postpaid Verizon access. These later plans also include international roaming and improved international calling features. Looking for streaming perks? The Plus plan even includes Disney Plus Premium for free, while the standard Unlimited plan just gives you a six-month trial.\nIf you have a large family, Total Wireless is a fairly tempting choice. This plan becomes even better if you happen to also have friends or family members outside of the US, as the perks here are quite good for the price. So why don\u2019t I mention this one more then? Honestly, it\u2019s because Visible is typically a better choice if you only need a line or two, as its pricing starts at just $25 for unlimited and maxes out at $45 a month, and yet it offers a very similar experience to Total, as it is also owned by Verizon.\nInterested in learning more? You\u2019ll want to check out Total Wireless\u2019 website.\nAre any of these carriers really worth it?\nWould you consider any of these brands?\nAgain, it really depends on what you are looking for. Out of all the brands on this list, I\u2019d personally recommend Helium and Total Wireless the most. Helium is great if you don\u2019t mind taking a risk of a brand that\u2019s newer to the mobile space, and Total has family plans that are truly hard to beat. As for the other three? While none of them are bad choices per say, for most folks, there are simply better options for a similar price that will likely provide a better value long term.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nI've had T-Mobile for 10 years, but I just canceled my account. Here's why\nMay 11, 2025\nFor the last 10 years, T-Mobile has been my cell phone carrier of choice. I\u2019ve been on a family plan with my partner, parents, and grandmother (with two lines for myself), and it\u2019s been a good experience for all of us. T-Mobile\u2019s coverage is reliable, 5G speeds are fast, and extra perks like weekly gas coupons and discounted streaming services have been nice cherries on top.\nHowever, after a decade of being a loyal T-Mobile customer, I\u2019m canceling my account and switching to another provider.\nWhy? It\u2019s something that\u2019s been boiling for a while, though anytime I\u2019ve thought about switching, I shrugged it off and decided to stay. That is the easier choice, after all. But T-Mobile\u2019s latest price increase pushed me over the edge, and after 10 years of use, I\u2019m officially moving on.\nIf you have a T-Mobile legacy plan that just got more expensive, what are you doing?\nThe price hike that broke the camel\u2019s back\nFor the last few years, my T-Mobile bill has ranged anywhere from $173/month to $183/month, depending on whether or not I have active LTE service for my Apple Watch. That\u2019s for six lines on a mixture of the old T-Mobile ONE and ONE Plus plans. Not too bad at all.\nI haven\u2019t been thrilled with everything else surrounding T-Mobile (security breaches, degrading customer service, etc.), but with my bill largely staying the same, I never felt compelled to jump ship. That changed with my most recent bill generated at the end of last month.\nAs announced in March, T-Mobile increased the cost of legacy plans by $5 per month per line. As such, my bill, which is usually $173 or $183 per month, jumped up to $212. My grandma\u2019s portion of the bill increased by $5, my parents\u2019 went up $10, and my partner and I were looking at a $15/month increase \u2014 with nothing to show for it other than more money leaving our pockets.\nIs an extra $15/month make-or-break money? In our situation, no. But it\u2019s still extra money we\u2019re paying without gaining anything in return. As a self-proclaimed penny-pincher, I wasn\u2019t a fan of that.\nT-Mobile has been testing my patience for years\nBut there\u2019s more to it. If this were the only issue we\u2019d had with T-Mobile in the 10 years we\u2019ve been customers, I\u2019d probably be willing to stomach the cost and remain subscribed. But having been a customer for so long, I\u2019ve witnessed firsthand a constant degradation in the service we\u2019re paying for.\nWhat kind of degradation? The mobile app is a prime example. For the longest time, T-Mobile had separate applications for its various services. There was a main T-Mobile app to manage your account and bill, plus another T-Mobile Tuesdays app to get your free goodies each week. They weren\u2019t anything spectacular, but they were good, reliable mobile apps.\nIn 2024, T-Mobile retired those applications and replaced them with a new, singular T-Life app. On paper, this is a swell idea. In practice, it\u2019s been awful. The app constantly throws pop-ups and survey requests in your face. Important details like bill history and payment methods are hidden below giant banners to remind you of your Magenta Status. The app regularly logs me out of my account even when I\u2019m actively using it, and on multiple occasions, it\u2019s failed to process a bill payment.\nI've witnessed firsthand a constant degradation in the service we're paying for.\nUnfortunately, this is not just a \u201cme\u201d issue. Take one look at Reddit, and you\u2019ll find endless reports of other people reporting similar (and other) problems with T-Life. It\u2019s a complete mess for so many different reasons, and considering T-Mobile is going all-in on T-Life, it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019ll get better any time soon.\nIt isn\u2019t just the T-Life app, though. Customer service used to be one of T-Mobile\u2019s biggest advantages over other major carriers. Remember when T-Mobile made a big push for its \u201cTeam of Experts\u201d program? The pitch was that all postpaid TMO subscribers had a small, dedicated group of customer service agents to help them out, and you\u2019d always talk to a real person and never a bot.\nYeah, not so much anymore. The last few times I\u2019ve used the live chat feature in T-Life, I\u2019ve had to first talk with T-Mobile\u2019s \u201cAI-powered Virtual Assistant.\u201d And, like any good AI customer service chatbot, I have to type \u201ccustomer service\u201d and indicate I want to talk to a real person to get the help I need. It\u2019s a mess.\nWhat else? The quality of freebies from T-Mobile Tuesday has decreased dramatically over the years. In 2023, T-Mobile removed autopay discounts if you had autopay set up with a credit card, forcing you to link your bank account or debit card to keep that discount. And that\u2019s not to mention the (at least) nine major data breaches T-Mobile has had since 2018.\nIf only one of these things were true, we\u2019d be having a different conversation. But the fact that all of this has happened \u2014 and T-Mobile is now asking me to pay more money for a significantly worse service \u2014 I\u2019m at my breaking point.\nI\u2019m ready to move on\nIf things have been so bad, why have I stayed with T-Mobile for so long? Because it was easy. I don\u2019t have an allegiance to the company or anything like that, but if you\u2019ve switched carriers before, you know how much of a hassle the process can be. But after months and years of mounting frustration, throwing a price increase on top of everything else finally got me to call it quits.\nThe good news is that there\u2019s never been a better time to switch. Google Fi\u2019s recent plan updates have made it more compelling than ever. Visible is a great choice if you want Verizon\u2019s network for cheap, and there\u2019s stuff to like with US Mobile and Helium Mobile, too. There are ample ways to get comparable cell service to what I had with T-Mobile, and they all cost significantly less.\nAfter years of frustration, a price increase on top of everything else finally got me to call it quits.\nDoes all of this mean T-Mobile is the worst carrier out there? One you should avoid altogether? No. If you\u2019re OK with the price increase and happy with your service, you may not need (or want) to switch.\nHowever, if you\u2019re a longtime customer like me who hasn\u2019t made a change in a while, and you aren\u2019t thrilled with the trajectory T-Mobile is heading, use this as your sign to start searching for something new. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing, and as time-consuming as searching for a new carrier may be, I think it\u2019ll be well worth it in the end.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nBest T-Mobile plans in 2025: Pricing, phone options, and more\nApril 28, 2025\nT-Mobile is one of the fastest-growing carriers in the United States thanks to aggressive pricing, marketing, and a penchant for doing the unexpected. The Uncarrier has significantly shaken up the mobile industry in the US, but recently it\u2019s made quite a few changes to its plans and how it operates.\nIn 2025, T-Mobile is still the most affordable of the big three carriers and has some very clear advantages, but it has also drifted away from its \u201caffordable hero\u201d image that the Uncarrier once invoked. Let\u2019s take a closer look at what T-Mobile has to offer in 2025.\nWhat plans does T-Mobile offer through its postpaid service?\nT-Mobile now offers just two main plans:\n- Experience More: This plan is the recommended entry point for most users.\n- Experience Beyond: This plan adds more international data, phone upgrade features, and other perks.\nIn addition to these two plans, the Essentials and Essentials Saver plans offer a more basic experience and lower priority data, but come at a much lower price tag. Here\u2019s a deeper look at how all the plans compare:\n| Essentials Saver | Essentials | Experience More | Experience Beyond | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\nCost | Essentials Saver Prices per line, plus taxes and fees: $50 for one line $40 for two lines $33.33 for three lines | Essentials Prices per line, plus taxes/fees: $60 for one line $45 for two lines $30 for three lines $26.25 for four lines $24 for five lines $100/month for Essentials 4 Line Offer - better deal if you sign up for all four lines at once. | Experience More Prices per line, plus taxes/fees: $85 for one line $70 for two lines $42.50 for three lines $42.50 for four lines $40 for five lines | Experience Beyond Prices per line, plus taxes/fees: $100 for one line $85 for two lines $56.66 for three lines $53.75 for four lines $52 for five lines |\nUnlimited Talk & Text | Essentials Saver Yes | Essentials Yes | Experience More Yes | Experience Beyond Yes |\nUnlimited 4G Data | Essentials Saver Unlimited 5G/4G LTE with lower priority during congestion | Essentials Unlimited 5G/4G LTE with lower priority during congestion | Experience More Unlimited 5G & 4G LTE with Unlimited Premium Data | Experience Beyond Unlimited 5G & 4G LTE with Unlimited Premium Data |\nMobile Hotspot | Essentials Saver Unlimited 3G | Essentials Unlimited 3G | Experience More 60GB of high speed hotspot data, 3G speeds after | Experience Beyond 250GB of high speed hotspot data, 3G speeds after |\nNetflix perk? | Essentials Saver No | Essentials No | Experience More Netflix Standard with Ads | Experience Beyond Netflix Standard with Ads |\nApple TV perk? | Essentials Saver No | Essentials No | Experience More Included | Experience Beyond Included |\nHulu perk? | Essentials Saver No | Essentials No | Experience More No | Experience Beyond Hulu with Ads |\nUnlimited video streaming | Essentials Saver SD streaming | Essentials SD streaming | Experience More Up to 4K UHD streaming | Experience Beyond Up to 4K UHD streaming |\nInternational features | Essentials Saver - Unlimited talk and text in Canada and Mexico - Unlimited international texxting within the US | Essentials - Unlimited talk and text in Canada and Mexico - Unlimited international texxting within the US | Experience More - Unlimited international calling within the US - Unlimited talk, text and 15GB high-speed data in Canada and Mexico - Unlimited talk, text, and 5GB data in over 215 countries - In flight connections | Experience Beyond - Unlimited international calling within the US - Unlimited talk, text and 30GB high-speed data in Canada and Mexico - Unlimited talk, text, and 15GB data in over 215 countries - In flight connections |\nSatellite feature included? | Essentials Saver No | Essentials No | Experience More Free through 2025 | Experience Beyond Included |\nWhat about T-Mobile\u2019s prepaid offerings?\nT-Mobile offers a variety of prepaid plans that range from $40 to $60 a month for one line, or $25 to $35 per line for four. On the lower end of the scale, you\u2019ll get unlimited talk and text but just 10GB of data. Unlimited plans begin at $50 a month.\nAt a quick glance, here\u2019s the difference between the three unlimited plans:\n- T-Mobile Unlimited starts at $50 a month or as low as $25 per line for four. This is the most basic option with unlimited talk, text, and data, but only 3G hotspot speeds.\n- T-Mobile Unlimited Promo is $55 a month or as low as $30 a month for four. This plan adds talk and text in Mexico and Canada, texting to over 200 destinations from within the US. You even get 3GB of high-speed hotspot data for domestic use.\n- T-Mobile Unlimited Plus is $60 a month or as low as $35 per line for four. This plan adds 10GB of high-speed data to the mix.\nOverall, I\u2019d recommend Unlimited Promo the most out of these three. In fact, it might even be a solid alternative to T-Mobile Essentials or Essentials Saver for those who want something a bit less locked in. You\u2019ll also pay around the same or a little less. You\u2019ll still get the same lower-level data priority with both plans as well.\nWhich of T-Mobile\u2019s plans do we recommend?\nIf you have your heart set on T-Mobile\u2019s service and aren\u2019t already a customer, I\u2019d suggest T-Mobile Experience More, as you\u2019ll get higher priority data than any of the prepaid options but you\u2019ll pay a lot less than Beyond.\nOf course, not everyone is the same. Here are a few other recommendations based on different use cases:\n- If you want better international features: You\u2019ll find that T-Mobile Experience Beyond is much better for frequent travelers than any of the other plans here.\n- If you simply want to save money: If paying less is what matters most, we\u2019d recommend the prepaid T-Mobile Unlimited Promo plan or the T-Mobile Essentials if you want better customer service, in-store support, and other postpaid perks. Just be aware both plans will have lower priority data.\n- If you want the best streaming perks: You\u2019ll find that T-Mobile Experience Beyond is the way to go with Hulu, Netflix, and Apple TV Plus on offer.\nOf course, there\u2019s also a lot of competition out there. If you aren\u2019t completely set on T-Mobile, you could save money and get a similar or even better experience elsewhere.\nBest T-mobile phones\nT-Mobile keeps its pricing and options consistent regardless of whether you\u2019re a prepaid or postpaid T-Mobile customer, though the latter will have financing options. If you go the prepaid route, you\u2019ll have to pay for the full phone outright. With that in mind, pretty much every major flagship sold in the US can be found on T-Mobile. Be sure to head to T-Mobile\u2019s official store for a full look at what\u2019s available.\nLooking for more options? Visit our best Android phones and best cheap phones guide to learn more about many of the great unlocked phones you can bring to T-Mobile. Of course, you can also unlock any T-Mobile phone if you want to jump to a new network.\nT-Mobile vs the competition\nIf you\u2019re here to switch carriers, you might wonder how T-Mobile compares directly to the other major carriers.\nVerizon:\n- Pricing: $65-90 per line, or as low as $30-$55 per line for four\n- Notable extras: Optional perks for streaming and more\nAT&T:\n- Pricing: $50-$85.99 per line, or as low as $30.99-$50.99 per line for four\n- Notable extras: Nearly all plans include talk and text in Canada and Mexico\nAs you can see, T-Mobile prices are pretty comparable to the other big three. You\u2019ll also get similar roaming features and the best streaming features, depending on your plan choice. If you live in an area with solid T-Mobile coverage and absolutely want postpaid service, T-Mobile is probably your best bet. Verizon is a very close second in 2025, and my number one pick if you live in an area with weaker T-Mobile coverage, especially.\nOf course, in 2025 the real competition won\u2019t be found in the postpaid realm. Prepaid carriers have evolved to match their postpaid counterparts in many ways, including payment plans and more for some brands. There are typically some small sacrifices when it comes to the speed of customer service or network priority in some cases, but you\u2019ll also pay a lot less for service.\nWe have a guide that looks closer at the best phone carriers in the US, but here\u2019s a quick look at just a few of my top recommendations:\nGoogle Fi Wireless\nGoogle Fi Wireless is a great option if you\u2019re looking for something that feels like a postpaid carrier. In fact, you\u2019ll find a lot of perks that you\u2019d probably normally associate with the big three networks, including:\n- Free or low-cost phone promotions.\n- Device financing and insurance options.\n- Exceptional family discounts.\n- Exceptional international roaming features.\n- The same high-priority T-Mobile data you\u2019d get with Experience More or better.\nMetro by T-Mobile\nMetro is directly owned by T-Mobile and also feels more like a postpaid provider when it comes to the extras it provides, with the exception of network priority. While Google Fi is prioritized, Metro will have the same lower priority data you\u2019d get with T-mobile Essentials. Here are some other features worth highlighting:\n- Amazon Prime on select plans\n- Much cheaper pricing than T-Mobile postpaid\n- T-Mobile\u2019s new 5-year price lock\n- Free phone promotions\n- T-Mobile Tuesdays\nVisible\nThis is my personal top recommendation for most users. While the Verizon-owned carrier doesn\u2019t offer any kind of customer service outside of the web, its no-frills approach makes it a stark alternative to the others I just listed above. You\u2019ll get some of the very best single-rate prices you\u2019ll find in the US with unlimited plans as low as $25 a month. Here are a few other highlights:\n- Truly unlimited data including hotspot (though the latter is speed throttled)\n- An optional plan with unlimited premium data\n- Decent international roaming options are available\nFrequently asked questions\nYes, as long as it\u2019s unlocked. If you\u2019re switching from another carrier you\u2019ll want to make sure the phone can be unlocked and is compatible with T-Mobile\u2019s network.\nThis question used to be a lot easier to answer before the Sprint and T-Mobile merger. Deutsche Telekom is still the majority owner of the new T-Mobile, controlling around 43%. Softbank is the second-largest controlling part, with roughly a 24% cut. Outside shareholders hold the rest of the shares.\nYou can unlock your T-Mobile phone for use with another network as long as you meet specific requirements, including an account in good standing, a fully paid device active on the network for at least 40 days for post-paid accounts, and a few other hoops for prepaid. For more specific instructions, head over to T-Mobile.\nTechnically, T-Mobile supports GSM alongside its LTE and 5G standards.\nMost likely, yes. While Verizon is a CMDA carrier and T-Mobile runs on GSM, the former\u2019s devices are typically designed with all the necessary GSM bands (for use while traveling, etc.). Be sure to check out the specific Verizon phone in question and make sure it can run on the same bands required by T-Mobile in your area.\nObviously, the answer to this varies on what you\u2019re looking for and where in the US you live. That said, don\u2019t assume it won\u2019t work well if you tried T-Mobile years ago and found it wasn\u2019t powerful in your area. Years ago, T-Mobile was best suited for urban areas, but with changes to its network (including the purchase of Sprint), this is no longer the case. Consult T-Mobile\u2019s coverage map for more details.\nYes, T-Mobile supports Wi-Fi calling on its network.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nGoogle Fi was the perfect carrier for me 10 years ago, but not anymore\nApril 22, 2025\nWhen Google first announced what was then called Project Fi on April 22, 2015, I was more than a little intrigued. As a tech journalist, it was easy for me to see the appeal of a carrier with flexible data that worked seamlessly in the US and abroad. I signed up immediately.\nAt the time, it was hard to imagine a better option. Not only did I love the international coverage, but the service itself felt more like a postpaid provider. I used the service for more than six years straight, but fast forward to 2025, and I haven\u2019t been a regular Google Fi user since about 2021. I still reactivate it occasionally for testing, and I\u2019d likely use it again if I started traveling more frequently.\nWhile Google Fi was the perfect carrier for me 10 years ago, a lot can change in a decade. I travel less now, and the prepaid market has matured. Parts of what drew me to Fi haven\u2019t really changed; it\u2019s my needs and the competitive landscape that have evolved.\nAuthor\u2019s note: When this was originally published, Google had yet to announce a new plan for its anniversary. Five hours later, its arrival changes things a little. That said, while this is a great upgrade, it still doesn\u2019t largely change the fact that Google Fi isn\u2019t quite for me right now. That said, I\u2019m certainly paying attention to the changes and hope this means Google is far from done pushing Fi Wireless forward.\n10 years in, how do you feel about Google Fi?\nWhat drew me (and many like me) to Google Fi in the first place\nIn its early days, Google Fi felt like a disruptor. It was sort of the prepaid equivalent of John Legere\u2019s T-Mobile. Fi launched at a time when US prepaid carriers were improving, but there was still a clear divide between prepaid and postpaid options.\nThen came Fi: a prepaid carrier that made international data easy and affordable. It offered simple pricing, multi-network support, a built-in VPN, and a Wi-Fi-first approach to calls, texts, and data at a time when Wi-Fi calling was still uncommon in the US.\nI\u2019d always been hesitant about prepaid service, but Fi felt like the future. Its arrival convinced me to drop Sprint and activate service on my Nexus 6 using a special invite code.\nBack then, Fi had a single plan: $20 per month for talk and text, plus $10 per gigabyte of data. This was before unlimited data plans became widespread in the U.S. The most comparable postpaid plans cost around $80 per month for 10-12GB back in 2015. If memory serves, plans often included at least 5GB by default, though it varied.\nGoogle Fi felt like a disruptor and a better way to prepay.\nOne of the biggest draws for me was the simple pricing. I worked from home, so I rarely used mobile data. Because Fi credited unused data, my monthly bill usually stayed low. Typically, I used no more than around 1.25GB at this time, which was just $12.50 on top of the base rate.\nAt the time, international support was more of a bonus than a necessity. But later, when I started traveling abroad more often, it proved invaluable. I didn\u2019t need to fiddle with APN settings or swap SIMs \u2014 the service just worked. Occasionally, I had to toggle airplane mode or reboot, but overall, it was remarkably smooth.\nNetwork switching wasn\u2019t flawless, to be fair. Fi sometimes defaulted to weaker signals, though you could force a switch using third-party apps. Still, it felt like a cutting-edge carrier subscription.\nFi originally partnered with T-Mobile and the then-independent Sprint. In 2016, it added US Cellular, which was a big deal in my area. I hoped Google would eventually bring even more networks under its umbrella, but that never happened. Instead, Sprint and T-Mobile merged, and US Cellular became more of a fallback option. I don\u2019t blame Google Fi for this; the mobile landscape was changing quickly, and as an MVNO, Google had limited control.\nEven as multi-network support faded, Fi\u2019s overall philosophy stayed the same. Over time, it added unlimited plans, international streaming, family discounts, device promotions, and other features. But none of this happened in a vacuum. The prepaid market improved, the pandemic reduced international travel, and my own needs shifted.\nGoogle Fi didn\u2019t change \u2014 but I did, and so did the market\nGoogle Fi has slowly evolved, but it hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed. Since its early days, it\u2019s been built largely around three core ideas:\n-\nUS coverage through multiple networks\n-\nSeamless international travel\n-\nSimple, transparent pricing\nNow rebranded as Fi Wireless, it still aims to deliver those goals. The difference is that many of its once-unique features are no longer exclusive and, in some cases, arguably no longer best-in-class.\nWide coverage across the US\nIn 2025, Fi relies solely on T-Mobile\u2019s network. T-Mobile has good nationwide coverage now \u2014 thanks in part to its Sprint merger \u2014 but so do most carriers. What used to make Fi special for me was its ability to hop between networks.\nI\u2019ve lived in several rural areas, so network flexibility used to matter a lot. These days, I live in a rural region with excellent Verizon-based coverage but not-as-good T-Mobile coverage. On Verizon, I get strong reception and 5G nearly everywhere, so Fi\u2019s single-network setup holds less appeal to me since it runs on the Uncarrier\u2019s network.\nIf you need access to multiple networks, Fi is no longer the leader here either. US Mobile now fills that niche, supporting all three major networks and offering advanced options like Warp 5G and Light Speed for automatic switching between two networks.\nSeamless international travel\nFi was once the king of international travel with $2 per gigabyte of data in over 200 countries \u2014 and it just worked. Today, competitors have raised the bar.\nAll three major US carriers now include free roaming in Canada and Mexico on most postpaid plans. Some prepaid carriers do as well. Verizon\u2019s premium plans extend coverage to many countries, albeit at a higher cost. Prepaid options have stepped up, too:\n- Mint Mobile: Free calling to Mexico, Canada, and the UK from the U.S. It also offers free roaming in Canada or a $20 \u201cMinternational Pass\u201d with 10GB of data (works out to the same $2 per gig as the Google Fi Flex plan charges in 2025).\n- Visible: All Visible Plus tier plans include unlimited talk and text in Canada and Mexico. Higher-tier plans add Global Pass days, plus broad international texting and calling options.\n- US Mobile: International calls from the US are included in unlimited plans. Higher-tier options offer up to 20GB of roaming data usable in hundreds of countries, depending on the network (Dark Star, Warp, or Light Speed).\nTo be clear, none of these international programs quite match Google Fi Wireless even in 2025, as this is one area where Google has never fallen behind, especially when it comes to the Fi Unlimited Plus plan.\nGoogle\u2019s best plan includes 50GB of high-speed data usable in the US or abroad across over 200 countries. There\u2019s no need to accrue passes or juggle multiple caps. As long as you spend most of your time in the US during any 90-day window, Google doesn\u2019t mind if you travel extensively. That\u2019s hard to beat, though it\u2019s overkill for many users.\nEven for those who travel less, Fi offers a hidden advantage: reliability. Fi\u2019s international experience is rarely perfect, but it usually works with fewer hiccups. A quick glance at Reddit shows many users struggling with APN issues on other carriers like US Mobile, Mint Mobile, and countless others. Visible is generally more reliable here, but this is still a category where Fi has an edge.\nSimple, transparent pricing (and once, value)\nI already mentioned how Google Fi had more transparent pricing and was generally a better value unless you consumed huge amounts of data in 2015. Of course, trends and pricing change. Unlimited became more common again, and even Google introduced its own unlimited plan in 2019.\nAt launch, Google Fi Unlimited cost as little as $45 per line for four, or $180 in total. At the time, this was still at least $30 less per person than you\u2019d pay for unlimited with any of the big three carriers, typically, and yet it still had superior international features. The rates were also pretty comparable to other prepaid unlimited plans of the era, depending on the number of lines involved.\nGoogle's pricing is still straightforward, just no longer particularly impressive unless you are a frequent international traveler.\nFi kept its original flexible plan (now called Fi Flexible), but its value proposition weakened. By 2019, Mint Mobile charged $15 a month for 3GB, $20 for 8GB, and $25 for 12GB. In contrast, Google Fi charged $20 just for access and $10 per gig. Using only 500MB could still cost $25 a month \u2014 more than Mint\u2019s 12GB tier.\nIn 2019, I switched to Fi\u2019s Unlimited plan, which I kept until 2021. As my traveling days came to a halt, I later downgraded to the then-new Simply Unlimited plan, which dropped international features in exchange for lower pricing. A single line at the time cost $60 a month, but three or more lines brought the price down to $30 each. While not a bad deal for families, it no longer stood out unless you wanted phone deals tied to Pixel or Galaxy promos.\nAfter a few months on Simply Unlimited, I realized I didn\u2019t need Fi anymore. I began exploring other prepaid carriers, and I haven\u2019t looked back outside of work purposes.\nGoogle Fi is a niche carrier in 2025, and that seems to be by design\nIn 2025, 10 years after its launch, Google Fi has been overtaken in affordability by carriers like Tello and Mint Mobile, especially for low-data plans. Even on the unlimited side, there are cheaper options, though Fi Wireless remains comparable to other premium prepaid brands like Cricket and Metro by T-Mobile.\nMany of Fi\u2019s early advantages eroded over time, but that was never really the point. Google Fi was designed to offer simple, reliable service anywhere, without hidden fees or confusing roaming charges. While it\u2019s moved away from its original multi-carrier model in the US, its core philosophy remains intact. The main difference now is that it has greater competition.\nFi still shines for frequent international travelers, especially when it comes to the Unlimited Plus plan. Google seems content keeping Fi Wireless a niche product, and that\u2019s okay. It has a clear target audience and yet still manages to attract others, such as families taking advantage of multiline discounts or fans of the broader Google ecosystem.\nPersonally, I switched to Visible for my main line after leaving Google Fi. It was far cheaper than Fi\u2019s Simply Unlimited and worked well on Verizon\u2019s strong network in my area. Eventually, I moved to a Verizon family plan to finance multiple devices (largely a mistake), though I\u2019m slowly migrating back to prepaid options as those phones are paid off.\nGoogle Fi would need to change in a few ways to bring me back, but it doesn't really need to.\nI still test Google Fi occasionally when something new rolls out, but those moments are rare. Fi Wireless hasn\u2019t pushed the envelope lately, and unless I start traveling more, I don\u2019t see myself returning full-time. Barring that, to get me back, Google Fi\u2019s Simply Unlimited would need more generous hotspot limits and a higher data cap before throttling kicks in. Lower pricing would help, too, especially for the Flexible plan, which still charges $20 for access and $10 per gig, which feels like a lot in 2025.\nOf course, Google would need to be careful. Price cuts could undermine the postpaid-like experience that keeps many loyal customers around. And even then, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to win me over, as my biggest barrier is Fi\u2019s reliance on T-Mobile. Unless T-Mobile\u2019s coverage improves in my area \u2014 or Fi brings back multi-network support like US Mobile \u2014 I\u2019m not likely to switch back.\nRealistically, I don\u2019t expect big changes. Google Fi Wireless clearly isn\u2019t a major company priority, and keeping the status quo seems more in line with its current strategy. Price tweaks, sure. But I don\u2019t foresee any dramatic overhauls (though I could be wrong).\nThat said, while Google Fi is no longer my personal carrier of choice, it\u2019s still one of the best mobile phone service providers in the US. I still often recommend it to those who travel frequently or for those who might value its unique perks. It may not be mainstream, but for the right user, it still delivers.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."
