      "feedback": "Solid start, but the piece needs a tighter, three‑layer structure, sharper causal chains, and explicit, source‑driven boundaries to reach world‑class quality for a 0–3 week horizon. Concrete edit directions below in one compact paragraph:\n\n- Rebuild the micro narrative around a single, testable Beasley/CAP trigger: state the exact leverage map (Detroit’s non‑taxpayer MLE exhausted by LeVert at 2 years, $28.9M; Beasley max re‑sign with Pistons via Early Bird at $7.2M; other teams can outbid with full non‑tax MLE or cap space). Quantify the move’s mechanical effect on Pistons’ cap sheet and Beasley’s decision, then lay out the near‑term catalysts (Beasley contract talks re‑emerging or Beasley‑signing with another team) and the invalidation point (Beasley signs at or above $15M/year with another team or new federal/Govt statement shifts investigation status). Tie every assertion to XB5ZRN1VP and/or ESPN/Known sources in S‑series (the exact numbers from XB5ZRN1VP, including the 3‑year, $42M MLE discussion, the $7.2M ceiling, and the MLE/Non‑Bird nuances) and avoid generic language.\n\n- Add a clear macro transmission map with explicit, dated catalyst anchors: list the tariff pass‑through as a near‑term inflation channel with a quantified anchor (tariff rate moved to 15% and noted pass‑through; cite S15934PBQ, and contrast with the “no clear price increase” stance from some automakers). Specify the CPI/pricing monitors and auto‑sector earnings calls to watch in the next 2–3 weeks; give a threshold (e.g., if CPI core autos component prints hotter than ~0.4–0.6% m/m, imply higher rate expectations). Reconcile the Street’s pass‑through claim with the narrative that tariffs are easing but still cost‑pressure; anchor every causal step (tariff → input costs → auto pricing → consumer inflation expectations → Fed/POM decisions) to S15934PBQ.\n\n- Strengthen the tech/durables and consumer‑finance thread with tight, device‑level data and explicit market implications: present BeeStation Plus as a concrete unit economics example (8TB, ~$400, no subscription; Plex/cloud‑sync integrations; 8 users) and state how this fits a broader “substitute cloud storage” demand in 0–3 weeks (watch for consumer demand signals, unit sales velocity, and reviews; cite 8VMO3PFEO and BST170‑8T page S9). Pair this with a crisp contrast to a budget‑tier consumer angle (Douglas Tires summary in 4B5JK15SY) to illustrate price‑quality trade‑offs in a tightening discretionary environment. Translate into a near‑term consumer spend impulse: will cloud‑storage substitution bite pricing signals or capex cycles in retail/household tech? Tie back to the cited sources.\n\n- Integrate a formal, three‑scenario framework (base/bull/bear) with explicit catalysts and invalidations, and map each to a monitoring list: Beasley outcome (base: Beasley re‑signs for ~$7–$9M one year or two, with Early Bird rights; bear: Beasley signs elsewhere at a higher price; bull: Detroit keeps LeVert/Beasley in a revised mix). Tariffs/auto pricing (base: 15% pass‑through continues but moderated; bull: broader auto pass‑through re‑accelerates prices; bear: tariff relief dominates and CPI cools). Credit/loans/financing costs (base: fixed vs. variable rate paths hold; bull: rates drift higher; bear: rate relief from policy signals). For each, specify the numeric triggers (Beasley price, CPI autos component, Fed commentary) and the corresponding market reaction function (cap space churn, inflation read, consumer credit costs). Use precise citations next to each assertion.\n\n- Tighten the numbers discipline and ensure no unsupported generalities: whenever you claim “cap space is available” or “outbid Detroit,” back it with concrete figures from sources (Nets cap space; Bulls/Wizards/Kings/MLE opportunities; 14.1/15.0M MLE benchmarks in XB5ZRN1VP; RealGM/Spotrac data in S6/S7 as applicable). Explicitly quantify the potential delta in Detroit’s cap room if Beasley signs elsewhere (e.g., loss of Early Bird leverage vs. MLE ceiling). Add a brief, transparent reconciliation of any conflicting facts (e.g., tariff pass‑through vs. official price claims) with direct source quotes.\n\n- Improve format/length discipline by delivering: a lean, causal chain (Beasley/cap → rival bids → Pistons response) in one paragraph, a crisp 2–3 bullet “near‑term catalysts to watch” list, and a 1‑slide‑style “watch levels” box (Beasley bid threshold, CPI autos component threshold, auto‑sector earnings date). Ensure every claim maps to one of the cited sources (XB5ZRN1VP; S15934PBQ; 8VMO3PFEO; S9; 4B5JK15SY; S7M6BJSRT) and remove any extraneous data not anchoring the horizon.\n\nIn short, add a formal micro/macro conduit with precise numbers and explicit triggers, present Beasley as a single, testable cap‑story with clear invalidation points, embed a 0–3 week scenario plan with thresholds, and calibrate the inflation/price dynamics using the tariff piece as the primary macro input, all while maintaining tight source‑to‑claim traceability.",
