  "content": "Fundstrat Chief Investment Officer Tom Lee has predicted that Ethereum will rally in the near term to $5,500, with an ambitious year-end target of $12,000.\n\nDuring his August 26 guest appearance on the Amitis Investing program, Lee disclosed that institutional Wall Street sentiment toward Ethereum has shifted dramatically following the U.S. Senate\u2019s passage of the GENIUS Stablecoin legislation.\n\nLee emphasized that Ethereum is the foundational blockchain infrastructure for traditional finance (TradFi), currently supporting over $145 billion in stablecoin supply.\n\nThis substantial market dominance is among the primary reasons he considers ETH one of the largest macro investment opportunities of the coming decade.\n\nFollowing Lee\u2019s launch of the ETH treasury firm BitMine, substantial capital flowed into Ethereum.\n\nInvestment managers and retail investors have been systematically reallocating funds from Bitcoin to Ethereum, with daily rotation volume averaging $900 million.\n\nBetween June 30, when Tom Lee initiated BitMine\u2019s Ethereum accumulation strategy, Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization expanded by over $255 billion.\n\nStandard Chartered analyst Jeff Kendrick recently observed that ETH treasury companies are becoming increasingly large in terms of capital flows compared to their Bitcoin counterparts.\n\nFrom a regulatory arbitrage standpoint, Kendrick believes these Ethereum-focused treasury entities possess greater expansion potential compared to Bitcoin treasury companies.\n\nTom Lee\u2019s internal analyst, who accurately predicted last week\u2019s Ethereum decline to $4,075 before the subsequent rally to an all-time high of $4,900, has provided new analysis to the BitMine leadership.\n\nOn August 26, Tom Lee anticipated Ether\u2019s price floor to materialize within hours, coinciding with BitMine Immersion Technologies\u2019 acquisition of an additional $21.28 million in ETH, increasing total holdings to 1.72 million ETH worth $7.65 billion.\n\nThis forecast aligned with insider analyst Mark Newton\u2019s technical evaluation, which suggests Ethereum will advance toward new peaks near $5,100 before targeting the $5,500 level.\n\nIn a subsequent CNBC interview, Lee reinforced his ETH projections with bold price targets ranging from $12,000 to $16,000 for Ether, stating his belief that \u201cEthereum is experiencing its Bitcoin 2017 moment.\u201d\n\nTom Lee gained recognition in 2017 when he appeared on CNBC advocating for a $55,000 Bitcoin target, while the cryptocurrency was trading at $2,000.",

His BitMine treasury strategy has driven a $255\u202fbillion increase in ETH market cap and daily rotation of roughly $900\u202fmillion from Bitcoin to Ethereum. Analysts note that ETH\u2011focused treasury firms are expanding faster than Bitcoin counterparts, reinforcing Lee\u2019s view that Ethereum is poised for a \u201cBitcoin 2017\u201d\u2011style surge. The forecasts align with technical analysis that projects ETH to reach new peaks near $5,100 before hitting the $5,500 level. ",
