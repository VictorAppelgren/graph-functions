  "title": "Best Christmas gifts for the 2025 holiday season",
  "description": "These are the gifts we've tried, tested, and loved this year.",
  "content": "Choosing the best Christmas gifts for the ones you love is either an epic quest that you look forward to every year \u2014 or one you dread. Luckily, we spend our days testing all the latest gadgets and gear, and we know exactly what to recommend. For 2025, our Christmas wishlist is simple: It's all of the things we've loved the most this year, from the tech we're putting to the test every week, to the swoonworthy items we just had to take home and keep for ourselves. With input from Mashable's own reporters and editors across the Tech and Shopping teams, every item on our list is something we use, love, or have gifted to others ourselves. So whether you're searching for Christmas gifts for your mom and dad, or just in need of a good stocking stuffer, this may truly be the only Christmas gift guide you'll need.\n\nBeloved by reviewer Alex Perry, who wrote that the new release is \"a fabulous follow-up to an all-time legend\" and that he \"can't stop playing\" with the handheld gaming device. The Nintendo Switch 2 is a Mashable Choice product, thanks in large part to \"massively improved system software\" and \"wonderful online social features with GameChat.\" Read the full review of the Nintendo Switch 2.\n\n\"I love mine so much, and I think it's the best thing I've ever bought,\" says Deputy Shopping Editor Miller Kern. The Kindle Paperwhite is well-loved across much of Mashable, in fact, and was given a coveted Mashable Choice award for \"its responsive interface, quick-turning pages, and lightweight design.\" Read the full review of the Kindle Paperwhite.\n\nThese kits can be built quickly, are relatively cheap (compared to other Lego sets), and are super fun to play with, as Mashable Tech Editor Timothy Beck Werth recently discovered during a playdate with his nieces and nephews. The magic comes from the \"turtle shell-firing mechanism,\" just like in the video game. Read the full story from Werth.\n\nWe put these new headphones to the test and determined, \"If you want best-in-class noise-cancelling headphones and pristine audio quality, the headphones deliver.\" An iteration of earlier models from Sony, the XM6 headphones feature improved audio quality, phenomenal active noise cancellation, and a comfortable headband and earcups. Read the full review of the Sony XM6 headphones.\n\nCreators, TikTokkers, and aspiring influencers will adore unwrapping this gimbal stabilizer on Christmas morning. Our tech editor calls it \"the best gimbal I've tested so far.\" This high praise is due to the gimbal's ease of use, stability, and 10-hour battery life.\n\nAnother recommendation from our tech editor, these wireless earbuds are a Mashable Choice award winner and \"easily beat the likes of Sony and Bose.\" They pair easily, are comfortable to wear, and sound fantastic. \"If you're looking for earbuds with the best possible sound quality, these are now the buds to beat,\" says Werth. Read the full review of the Technics AZ100 earbuds.\n\nIt's a cooler. It's a Bluetooth speaker. It's both! We love this highly giftable item for its retro design and exceptionally good sound quality. Mashable's Senior Shopping Reporter Haley Henschel owns this herself, saying, \"I'm obsessed with it. I think it should go on every gift guide.\" Read the full review of the Igloo KoolTunes Bluetooth Cooler.\n\nThis is more of a stocking stuffer, but it's a great one for wannabe influencers or anyone who's dreamed of going viral. Recommended by Mashable Senior Shopping Reporter Haley Henschel, Octobuddy is simply a silicone phone case with a series of suction cups on the back. TikTok-obsessed teens will especially appreciate the simple design that makes filming GRWM videos way easier \u2014 we frequently see the Octobuddy mentioned in our In My Bag series.\n\nMultiple editors and writers on Mashable swear by these noise reduction earplugs, saying they've worn them to concerts, while traveling, and more as a way to cut back on excess sound without missing out on what's going on. They're a great stocking stuffer, well-priced, and come in four different colors. Read our guide to the best sleep earbuds.\n\nOne of the more frustrating parts of cooking on a grill is that it's hard to know what's going on in there without living the cover. Of course, doing so lets out heat and can slow cook times. Enter the Monument Mesa Grill, which has a clear viewing window built into the top. Werth says that both his father-in-law and uncle are obsessed with it.\n\nThere is something so luxurious about a brand-new set of bath towels that all match and feel wonderful. It's like a warm hug each time you get out of the shower. The ones from Brooklinen are particularly loved by our staff \u2014 our tech editor says, \"Brooklinen makes the best towels in the world.\" Period.\n\nWhat's old is new again with the Loftie alarm clock, which our staff loves for allowing them to ditch the screens while in bed. Lead Shopping Reporter Bethany Allard owns this and says it's \"a very pleasant alarm clock to wake up to.\" It's customizable, with nice-sounding alarm options and a built-in night light. Read more about the Loftie alarm clock.\n\nAfter testing Ninja appliances for weeks, this is the one that Shopping Reporter Sam Mangino has made her own. The 3-in-1 machine can tackle espresso, drip coffee, and cold brew, and even has a built-in bean grinder. Mangino says she really loved this one because it \"streamlines the process and cuts down on the learning curve.\" See how the Ninja Luxe Caf\u00e9 fared on our list of the best Ninja appliances.\n\nHydro Flask had her moment. We have now entered the Owala era. Almost everyone on Mashable's Shopping team has the Owala FreeSip, which reporter Sam Mangino dubbed the \"best water bottle ever.\" The 24-ounce insulated stainless steel bottle is designed to accommodate both sipping (via straw) and good, ol' fashioned gulp when tipped back.\n\n\"I love it so much,\" says Shopping Reporter Sam Mangino, who owns this maple cutting board. Made in the USA, each cutting board is a thing of beauty. It's no wonder Mangino keeps hers out on the counter at all times, as if it was a piece of artwork \u2014 because it is.\n\nOur staff loved the Kobo Libra Colour during testing, saying that it makes a really great alternative to the Amazon suite of products. The e-reader allows you to interact with the text and highlight passages in color (thus the name), making things like comic books and graphic novels a bit more enjoyable. Our reviewer said the ergonomics of the e-reader are particularly good too, especially if you like to read in bed. Read the full review of the Kobo Libra Colour.\n\nWe spend a lot of time testing headphones and earbuds, and we have no shortage of recommendations when it comes to this great stocking stuffer. Our staff swears by these Bose Ultra Open earbuds, saying they're really great for working out or going on walks while remaining aware of the world around you. Read more about the best open earbuds.\n\nWe're obsessed with this skincare wand, and after vigorous testing, have deemed it to be a Mashable Choice award winner. Our staff says that as far as beauty tools go, it's a great introduction to tech-powered skincare. It's not as effective as a red light mask and you have to be more diligent with the wand, but it will deliver that same experience at a fraction of the price. Read the full review of the Solawave Wand.\n\nIf you only gift one puzzle this year, let it be one of these. \"I'm a huge puzzle nerd, and I adore Piecework puzzles,\" says Deputy Shopping Editor Miller Kern. \"All of the designs are super cute, and I have considered framing the ones I have.\" Others on the team agree. We love these puzzle for their bright photography and extra-thick pieces, which top out at 1,000.\n\nThis countertop icon is a workhorse for at-home bakers and cooks. We're obsessed. I have one, and love that it takes the muscle out of things like mixing, whisking, and kneading. One of the best parts about owning a KitchenAid Mixer are all the attachments, allowing you to utilize that powerful little motor in new ways, like grinding meat and making pasta. There's a reason why it landed on our list of the best products you'll buy once and own for life.\n\nDeputy Shopping Editor Miller Kern owns this and loves it, and after hearing her rave about it, it's now on the top of my very own Christmas wishlist. The portable printer works with any compatible iOS and Android device, allowing you to print photos on demand directly from your smartphone. The best part is the sticky photo paper, making this a great Christmas gift for anyone who likes to journal or scrapbook.\n\nThis super small and ultralight lavalier microphone would make a great Christmas gift for the creator, aspiring filmmaker, and podcast host in the family. Compatible with both iPhones and Androids (plus a host of cameras), these are the exact microphones that the Mashable social team used at VidCon. Highly recommend.\n\nDon't tell my mom, but this will be her gift this year: a rolling garden cart with storage inside and a seat, so she can bop along weeding her garden without bending over so much. I feel pretty confident that she's gonna love it.\n\nA member of our staff asserts that this is \"probably the best gift I've ever given my mom.\" We can see why. For those with family members scattered all over the globe, this simple visual reminder of their whereabouts can make everyone feel just a little bit closer. Plus, personalized Christmas presents are always so thoughtful.\n\nWe have a feeling this might actually be the best ever Christmas gift for dads. Here's why: This bird feeder with a built-in camera takes birdwatching to a whole new level. The compatible app even includes AI-powered bird identification, a livestream, and alerts for when there's a visitor on the feeder. We're obsessed, and we have a feeling your dad will be too.\n\nAnyone with kids knows that sleep can be hard to come by. We fell in love with this little gadget during testing, and now we're putting it at the top of our best Christmas gift ideas for kids. While Moonbird is designed for adults, Moonbuddy helps kids learn self-regulation, and it can be part of a calming bedtime routine and help ease stress. The secret is to have them match their breath to the handheld device.\n\nAnother great stocking stuffer, especially for anyone who juggles a lot of tech, likes to travel, or works remotely. The Charger \"features a retractable cable that snakes up inside the device when it's not in use. That means no annoying cable cluttering up your desk, countertops, or bedroom. It's one of those ingenious product innovations that makes you wonder, 'Why aren't all chargers like this?'\" Read our full review of The Charger.\n\nOur reporters maintain that the Ninja Swirl is \"way more fun\" than the more basic Creami, thanks in large part to the inclusion of a soft serve function. When Sam Mangino reviewed the Swirl, she loved it so much that she awarded it a coveted Mashable Choice, declaring, you'll \"never have to leave the house for soft serve again.\" Read the full review of the Ninja Swirl.\n\nOur team loves this as an add-on to the popular Nintendo Switch 2, with one reporter calling it their favorite gaming accessory. The case makes it easier to take the Switch 2 on the road, since the hard shell exterior keeps it protected in the event of a drop. The best part, though, is being able to quickly charge the device anywhere you are. Read our full take on the Belkin Nintendo Switch 2 Charging Case.\n\nWe test (and love) all the latest gadgets and tech products, but sometimes it's nice to take a step back from all of that and tune into nature. This steel drum sits in the garden and plays a series of 11 notes each time it's hit with rain. (Pro tip: You could also bring it into the shower.) It's soothing, it's unique, and it makes for a great Christmas gift.",

      "text": "I tested sleep earbuds for over a month: Here are the 3 I'd buy\nOverview\nTable of Contents\nGetting proper sleep can help improve nearly every aspect of your health, but over a third of adults in the United States don't get enough of it, according to the CDC.\nIf a noisy environment is what's keeping you up at night, you've likely considered foam earplugs, but those are no longer the only option available on the market \u2014 reusable earplugs and sleep earbuds offer a more convenient alternative.\nI spent a month and a half trying out earplugs and earbuds ranging from $50 to $349 to find the best of what's out on the market \u2014 and to see if getting earbuds just for sleep is actually worth it.\nNote: Following the Ozlo Sleepbuds price increase to $349, we can't recommend them at their full price \u2014 we think they're more worth it to catch on sale, ideally at their original price of $299. We're also currently in the process of testing the Anker Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds, which will come equipped with active noise cancellation for $229 when they're released in August.\nHow are sleep earbuds different than normal earbuds?\nFirst, a confession: I used to wear AirPods nearly every night to sleep. More accurately, I used to wear a single AirPod so I could actually sleep on my side.\nAfter testing earbuds designed for sleeping, I can tell you that everyday earbuds don't match up to the sleep earbud experience. For starters, standard earbuds aren't designed to be worn while you're lying on your side, so they often stick out of your ears and put hard plastic in contact with your ear. Not to mention, earbuds typically cap out at six to seven hours of battery life per charge, so if you're getting at least eight hours of sleep, you run the risk of interrupting it with the sound of your earbuds powering off.\nSleep earbuds, on the other hand, can offer white noise options, better battery life, and significantly more comfort (that actually allows you to wear more than one earbud at a time). The pairs I tested came without microphones and with touch controls that worked but were less sensitive than traditional earbuds, so you can lie on your side without activating them. There aren't really any options for active noise cancellation, but you'd be surprised at how well passive noise cancellation and a good fit can do for most nighttime noises.\nIs it safe to wear earbuds to sleep every night?\nFirst and foremost, it's important to consider that sleep earbuds aren't the only way to approach nighttime noises that might be keeping you up.\nI consulted Dr. Ashley Kita, an otolaryngologist and assistant professor in the Department of Head and Neck Surgery at UCLA, to discuss any risks associated with wearing earbuds all night. While she didn't warn against using earbuds, she suggested that if what's keeping you up is a partner's snoring, you start looking for solutions there.\n\"If you're doing all of this to avoid a partner who is snoring, sometimes gently encouraging that person to investigate why they're snoring is kind of an important consideration,\" Kita said. \"Because we find that obstructive sleep apnea is really underdiagnosed, and snoring, for some people, is the only sign of it.\"\nIf, however, what's keeping you up is less in your control, then you do want to be aware of three main aspects of using earbuds all night: proper hygiene, safe noise levels, and your ear comfort.\nProper hygiene\nWhen I started testing these earbuds, I realized I was now wearing earbuds uninterrupted for longer than I typically would in the course of a day, even as someone who tests headphones for a living. When I asked Dr. Kita how that wear time might raise someone's risk for infection, she drew a comparison to the wear time of hearing aids:\n\"Many individuals wear hearing aids for longer hours during the day than they sleep at night,\" she said. And yet, folks who wear hearing aids don't often have ear infections, though long wear times may increase their risk.\nWith the long wear times, Kita said the main concern she could anticipate was wax buildup since the natural path for wax to exit the ear canal would be blocked. However, she said it's not necessarily a cause for concern, as wax can typically exit the ear canal at other points during the day when you're not wearing earbuds (or blocking your ear canal in any other way).\nAs for any heightened infection risk, Kita shared that it can increase when there's greater wax buildup that can then trap bacteria. She recommended cleaning the buds with isopropyl alcohol and a cotton pad after each use, if possible. (The brand behind one of our picks below, Ozlo, recommends a weekly cleaning). With all that said, someone's risk for infection really comes down to personal susceptibility \u2014 some people are more prone to ear infections than others. If you fall into that category, being more proactive about cleaning your earbuds is a good practice.\nNoise levels\nNoise-induced hearing loss is the second most common type of hearing loss (behind age-related hearing loss), so it's important to be aware of the level of noise you expose yourself to. Kita pointed me in the direction of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) chart for how long people can be exposed to certain decibel levels safely.\nIn its FAQ, Ozlo also cites OSHA's recommendation, as well as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's recommendations, which top out at 90 decibels and 85 decibels for eight hours, respectively. With that in mind, Ozlo designed its earbuds so that their masking white noise tops out at 75 dB. We reached out to a rep from Soundcore to see if its earbuds have specific upper decibel limits, and will update this guide when we hear back. In general though, Kita said the less noise, the better, recommending that you always try to use the lowest volume possible.\n\"While I don't necessarily love the idea of extra noise when you're not even conscious to appreciate it, if it's the thing that's keeping you asleep or letting you sleep, it just comes in this category of risks and benefits,\" Kita said. \"Just make sure that it's quiet enough, then it really isn't that much different than using a white noise machine on your nightstand.\"\nComfort\nEarbuds fitting comfortably is important for you to be able to fall asleep, but also for your ear health.\n\"Everyone's ear canal is shaped differently,\" Kita said. \"And so something that might be really comfortable for your ears might really cause my ears to ache.\"\nIn other words, giving yourself earbuds-induced earaches every night can actually impact your ear health. If one of the below recommendations really isn't sitting right, even with adjustments to the ear tip sizes, don't be afraid to return them.\nThe best earbuds for sleeping\nBelow, I pulled three of the best sleep earbuds on the market. Between the overall, upgrade, and earplug picks, there's a wide range of price points, but as with any product, the most expensive of the bunch isn't necessarily the best overall. With that in mind, I highlighted where each earbud excelled, whether that be in comfort, noise cancellation, or ease of use, to help you pick the best sleep earbud possible.\nUPDATE: Jul. 5, 2025, 6:00 a.m. EDT As of April 2024, the Ozlo Sleepbuds increased in price from $299 to $349 on Ozlo's website and Amazon in the United States due to tariffs. We no longer recommend them at full price, but do recommend grabbing them if you catch them on sale for at least their original price.\nI tested out four sleep earbuds most nights over the course of the past month and a half, using each product for at least a week and half.\nDuring my testing, I paid attention to four major categories when determining which were the best:\nSimply put, earbuds that aren't comfortable will not be a pair that you reach for when you go to sleep. I paid attention to any ear soreness I felt in the mornings, and how easy it was to find the right fit that kept the earbuds secure in my ear, without feeling painful. While I never felt like there was nothing in my ear, I did only pick earbuds that wore well enough that I could forget I was wearing them. As Dr. Kita told me, everyone's ear shapes are different, so I also only included earbuds that had at least three different ear tip sizes to use.\nThere aren't really sleep earbuds on the market that offer active noise cancellation \u2014 the two pairs that made our list actually don't have microphones (which are standard for quality ANC). However, a good fit can take you a long way, and where you might need a little more help, white noise can make up the difference. I slept in a room with my partner, a mini split unit that likes to creak, and near a street where I can often hear cars late at night. The only earbuds that made this list were ones that significantly dampened, if not outright canceled out, those sounds.\nThis category covers a lot, from the battery life on the earbuds and the case, Bluetooth connection, app features, and even the size of the case (for those who have limited nightstand space). Basically, anything that could make these earbuds easier or more difficult to fold into a nighttime routine fell into this category \u2014 especially because the last time you want to be dealing with a pairing issue is right before you go to bed.\nIn a word, the price. Does it match up to the performance in each of the above categories? As I was looking at a $250 range between all the products I tested, I wanted to make sure that I felt those price differences in how the earbuds performed.\nAt the end of the testing period, the one product that didn't make the cut was the 1More Sleeping Earbuds Z30, which at $89.99, were the least expensive earbuds I tested. While significantly cheaper than the earbuds that did make the cut, their battery life, app features, and fit didn't quite match up to the other options on my list. However, if you're looking for very barebones low-profile earbuds (and don't mind hearing them die in the early hours of the morning), these aren't a bad option under $100.\nAnker Soundcore Sleep A20\nBest for most people\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Allows you to stream sleep sounds from app or your own audio\n- Tracks sleep data\n- Earbuds and case have great battery life\n- Half the price of the Ozlo Sleepbuds\n- Smaller case takes up less nightstand real estate\n- Touch controls don't get activated while you're sleeping\n- Comes with six different earbud tips, with three for noise blocking and three for breathability\n- Can't perform certain actions on app without both earbuds in\n- Sleep sound library isn't as good as Ozlo's\n- App design could be more streamlined\n- Earbud tips have slightly tacky texture\nWho it's for\nIf you want sleep earbuds that give you the flexibility of streaming audio or simply acting as fancier earplugs, the Anker Soundcore Sleep A20 will get the job done \u2014 and for half the price of our upgrade pick. They're not without some quirks, but on the whole, they offer the best feature to price point ratio.\nWhy we picked this\nI tested the Ozlo Sleepbuds right before I tested the Soundcore Sleep A20 buds, and honestly, it was hard to pinpoint any stark differences in performance, which considering their $150 price difference, is pretty impressive on Soundcore's part.\nThe Soundcore buds promised more battery life per charge, which I didn't really notice as both buds easily hit the eight-hour range. However, I did notice that the case held 80 hours of charge, meaning I didn't have to charge it for a week, while I had to recharge the Ozlo case after two nights of using the earbuds. The Soundcore buds also connected with my device with noticeably less lag than the Ozlos.\nSo where did they show their lower price point? Maybe this is more personal preference, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sleep sound library on the Soundcore app. A lot of the sounds felt too busy and too loud, even at lower volumes. One night, when I was testing out a feature that switches the audio from Bluetooth streaming to white noise when the earbuds detect you've fallen asleep, the sound of the white noise literally woke me up because of how loud it was. Admittedly, this was because of the volume I set it at, but only because the volume sounded fine (low even!) on the podcast I was streaming, and I didn't exactly expect the white noise from the Soundcore app to be significantly louder.\nWhen playing around with the controls later in the daylight hours, I found the highest volume literally hurt my ears \u2014 thankfully, setting it that high is avoidable, but it did feel like these headphones could've used a better safeguard in terms of volume. After all, it's not like you can quickly adjust the volume when you're unconscious. In terms of the automatic switching feature, I found that it usually jumped the gun. Sometimes, I'd just settle down to close my eyes and the earbuds would switch over (an issue I didn't experience with the Ozlo earbuds).\nIn terms of flaws, those were the only major ones I noticed. The buds stayed in my ears just as well as the Ozlos, and felt just as comfortable to use while lying on my side. Though both earbuds use silicone tips, the Soundcore ones feel the slightest bit tackier \u2014 it didn't bother me, but my partner couldn't stand the feeling, so if you deal with any sensory sensitivity, it's something to be aware of. My audio streamed reliably (if, again, a little on the loud side), and the touch controls worked perfectly when I used them but never accidentally triggered at night while I slept. In general, I didn't find myself using the touch controls to adjust the volume or switch between modes all that much, but they still felt like a nice addition.\nThe Soundcore earbuds also offer sleep data, which can be stored on the earbuds for up to a week (with a sync required to get the info in your app). I've never used any sort of sleep-tracking device before, but from the few times I've used sleep-tracking apps from my phone, these earbuds offered more accurate and detailed data on how I slept, from how long to how many times I tossed and turned.\nDetails\nOzlo Sleepbuds\nBest upgrade pick (to get on sale)\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Comfortable while secure\n- Switches between streaming and sleep sound audio very well\n- Great white noise selection\n- Volume controls easy to locate and allow for a lot of customization\n- A lot of choice in how and when you want white noise to play while you're sleeping\n- Multiple purchase options\n- No sleep metrics tracking yet\n- Case has a short battery life (and is fairly large)\n- Some lag when connecting to device and to Bluetooth playback\n- Could be spotty when connecting to the app\n- Price hike made them even more expensive than competitors options\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Ozlo Sleepbuds.\nWho it's for\nIf you want the luxury sleepbud experience and the best white noise selection available, the ex-Bose engineer-designed Ozlo Sleepbuds may just be worth investing in \u2014 as long as you can catch them on sale.\nWhy we picked this\nI won't sugarcoat it \u2014 these sleep earbuds aren't cheap. At a whopping $349, they're over twice the price of our top pick, six times the price of our earplug pick, and way, way more expensive than a pack of 100 foam earplugs. So do they live up to their price?\nAs an upgrade pick, sort of. When I first recommended these earbuds, they cost $299. Following Trump's tariffs, they jumped up to $349. While Ozlo is one of several companies that adjusted their prices, it's even harder to justify buying them at full price \u2014 especially with the Sleep A30 earbuds on their way to the market, with ANC and a much cheaper price point of $229. All this to say, if you're going to buy the Ozlo Sleepbuds, I only recommend grabbing them on sale.\nAs for what's available on the market now, I wouldn't say they're twice as good as the Sleep A20 earbuds, but they do offer a noticeably elevated experience. For starters, they're the slightest bit more comfortable, despite having larger wing tips to keep the earbuds in place. The silicone ear tips feel like those on the AirPods Pro, which are smooth without having any uncomfortable grip to them. The app itself is thoughtfully designed, with the volume controls and white noise selection sitting front and center at the top. Finding other features, like the alarm and sleep timers, requires minimal digging, making it exactly the kind of app I want to use shortly before falling asleep.\nThe white noises themselves, or \"Sleep Sounds\" as Ozlo calls them, hit the right balance of being loud enough to cancel out any sounds around you, without being so full that they're too distracting to actually fall asleep to. The app offers plenty of customization in how (and if) you want to use these sounds at all, whether you want them to play as soon as you take your earbuds out of the case or if you want to listen to your own audio first, then have the sounds kick in when you fall asleep. Only want them to play for some of the night? There's a setting for that as well, in addition to a simple timer that lets them kick in anywhere from 15 minutes to two hours. When I tested a feature that automatically switched sounds as you fall asleep, there was only one night where it didn't work correctly \u2014 considering it's still listed as a beta feature, I was impressed.\nSpeaking of beta features, my biggest gripe with these earbuds is that they don't offer any sleep-tracking data \u2014 yet. I understand that part of the higher price tag is the promise of updates to come, but considering the $150 A20 buds have this feature, it feels pretty odd to release headphones this expensive without them. Even a $250 price tag (which is what the Bose Sleepbuds II cost) would feel more appropriate with the product that's available at this point. All of that said, a rep from Ozlo told Mashable that the sleep data update is still at least a few months out, while the Ozlo app itself has a \"My Sleep\" tab, with a notice that the feature is \"coming soon.\"\nDespite that omission, the overall experience of using these earbuds feels more thought out and seamless than the Soundcore buds. I could snooze the alarm with Ozlo, where I didn't have that option with Soundcore. I could navigate the app more easily and toggle different features without having to switch between Bluetooth and sleep mode. Sure, Ozlo's buds still aren't perfect: For a couple of nights in the testing period, I did have minor issues connecting to the Ozlo app, but I stopped experiencing those issues following an update that came up toward the end of my testing period. The battery life on the case also only gets you through a couple of nights, but if you can keep them plugged in regularly, you can work around this issue.\nWith these gripes, I wish they were at least slightly more affordable, but overall, the Ozlo Sleepbuds do seem like a product intent on continuing to improve a solid starting point, and that ultimately offers the most frictionless experience. If you're interested but not quite ready to invest the Sleepbuds' asking price, they offer a rental program for $26 per month, as well as an option to buy with an HSA or FSA.\nDetails\nLoop Dream\nBest earplug option\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Incredibly comfortable to sleep in\n- Does a great job of blocking out noise without any extra white noise\n- Stays in ears well\n- Requires very minimal storage space\n- No fiddling with an app required\n- Block noise well, but still let through sounds like an alarm\n- Pricey\n- Recommended that you replace the ear tips every 100 wears\n- Fewer color options than other Loop earplugs\nWho it's for\nIf you like to keep it simple (and want to avoid using electronics before bed), a pair of reusable earplugs is a great way to block out sounds at night. The Loop Dreams are on the pricey side, but their durability, comfort, and noise-blocking abilities make them worth the price.\nWhy we picked this\nPriced at $50 for a pair of earplugs, I wanted the Loop Dreams to perform like a dream \u2014 so I was thrilled when they delivered.\nFull disclosure: Prior to testing these earplugs for this roundup, I owned a pair of original Loop Quiet earplugs (the Loop Quiet 2 earplugs retail for $27.95 and can be found on sale for $19.95). I generally used those for sleep, and so I had high expectations for Loop's Dream earplugs, specifically designed for sleeping, to elevate the experience.\nI'm going to be honest \u2014 the Loop Dreams don't block drastically more noise and feel significantly more comfortable, but to be fair, the Loop Quiets set the bar high. That said, having used both models, if you're only planning on using the earplugs during your sleeping hours, the Dreams are worth it for getting the best possible sleep experience. They never fell out of my ears, where the Quiets sometimes do. The foam ear tips are covered in silicone, and the outer closed loop shape is more tapered and smaller than the original Quiets as well, which have a more blunt tip. In general, these made the Dreams feel even more comfortable to wear and get a better seal for blocking out noise \u2014 more than once, when my partner rolled over to say something to me without realizing I was wearing these earplugs, I didn't hear a thing.\nYes, they're a good deal more expensive than the Quiets, but if you truly want to give yourself the best comfort and noise-blocking while you sleep, the Dreams are the way to go. And compared to either of our earbud picks (without white noise on, of course), I found that they blocked out sound even better. Considering all you have to do is learn how to put them in properly (which takes the slightest learning curve), they're also by far the easiest of our three picks to use.\nBeyond being no-fuss, a benefit I especially appreciated with using earbuds is that it minimized the temptation to spend more time on my phone than I really needed to right before bed. Best of all, despite how well they block room sounds like a partner sleeping or an air conditioning system, they let through more piercing sounds like that of an alarm, which was comforting both for waking up on time every day and for the reassurance that I'd wake up fine in the event of an emergency.\nSo sure, they're expensive \u2014 and their ear tip replacements aren't the cheapest either \u2014 but for the most straightforward noise-blocking solution that works well, and doesn't invite more screen time, I prefer the Loop Dream earplugs.\nDetails\nTopics Earbuds\nTesting updates\nWe're currently in the process of testing the Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds, which will be released to the general public in August. We also updated our recommendation of the Ozlo Sleepbuds following their price hike in April \u2014 we only recommend them on sale.\nBethany Allard is a Los Angeles-based shopping reporter at Mashable covering beauty tech, dating, sex and relationships, and headphones.

      "text": "I love sleeping \u2014 getting under the covers and rubbing my feet together like a little cricket before drifting into an easy sleep. Except that last part \u2014 drifting into an easy sleep \u2014 doesn't always happen for me. As an anxious person with insomnia, falling asleep is a battle. I've spent my lifetime gathering a tool kit of breathing exercises, trying sleep trackers, and developing a routine to combat sleepless nights. While I'm usually good at counting my breaths in my mindfulness practice, the Moonbird device promises to be a personal breathing coach for further relaxation.\nOver a few weeks, I tested the Moonbird handheld breathing coach, using it to relax in the evenings or calm down in anxious moments. While it's an effective tool, I'm not sure it's worth the price. Plus, we've got to talk about its... interesting design. Here are all my thoughts on the Moonbird breathing coach.\nIt's an effective, distraction-free breathing tool\nDespite being a tech-based tool, the Moonbird breathing coach is a distraction-free device without any required screen time. To use it, gently shake the device awake and hold it with your thumb resting against the sensor. The device then slowly expands and retracts to signal when you should inhale and exhale. The standard exercise runs for six minutes, and then the device shuts off. If you decide to end the exercise early, take your hand off the sensor, which will shut off after a few moments.\nHolding the device is genuinely comforting. The feeling of the smooth silicone expanding and falling emulates the image of a lung expanding or your stomach rising and falling with your breath. What I liked most is that using the device takes the thought out of the exercise. No longer did I need to count the seconds of my breath; instead, I focused on the tactile motions of the device, letting my mind rest.\nPlus, I love that the Moonbird has no screen or light. While I enjoy tuning into a meditation app or guided breathing exercise on my phone, I don't love doing so before bed when trying to avoid screen time. With the Moonbird, I hold the device to start the exercise with no blue light exposure. It's also a huge plus when I want to use it in bed. My partner goes to bed much earlier than I do, so I don't want to disturb them with any noise or light when I finally slip into bed. The silent and lightless Moonbird lets me use it without disturbing them.\nAnd the Moonbird does work. One evening after hosting a group of friends for movie night, I was still wired despite feeling exhausted. My brain wouldn't shut off after my evening reading, so I reached for the Moonbird to follow its breath coaching, and before the six-minute exercise was over, I was already drifting off. It proved that it really does come in handy in moments I'd otherwise feel restless.\nWith the app, get customizable breathing exercises and biometric feedback\nThe Moonbird comes programmed with a standard six-minute breathing exercise, but there are other options. When connected to the Moonbird app, you can adjust the device's settings to other breathing patterns designed for sleep or in the classic box breathing style. There's even an option to create your own breathing program if you have something that already works for you. Custom exercises can range from 2 to 30 minutes. The only downside is that you have to open up your smartphone to do so, defeating the purpose of a screen-free device. I preferred only adjusting the exercises during the day to avoid exposure to nightly screen time.\nIn addition to other Moonbird settings, the app has a library of educational materials on breathing, stress reduction, and heart rate. When using the app, you also gain access to biometric feedback, such as heart rate, so you can actually see the effects of the Moonbird device.\nThe Moonbird needs a redesign\nWe've gone this long, it's time to address the elephant in the room. The Moonbird totally looks like a vibrator. My colleagues and I thought so when we first saw the device, and I have touted it to all my friends for their opinions. Let's be clear, despite its looks, it is not a personal massager. While it's silly to acknowledge, its design affects its usage.\nThere are many situations where I'd love to bring along the Moonbird for some mindfulness on the go, whether coming down from a stressful situation at work or trying to fall asleep while flying. However, I'd be totally embarrassed to bring this on a plane, knowing what it could be misconstrued for.\nMoonbird has an alternative design, the Moonbuddy, which is designed for kids and is downright adorable. It doesn't have the same biofeedback or controls as the Moonbird, but I still wish the flagship device would take on a similar design to look less provocative and more appropriate for public use.\nThe app is buggy and doesn't have a ton to offer\nYou could use Moonbird without the app and be totally pleased with it, but $199 is a lot of money to spend on just one breathing exercise. Downloading the app unlocks heart rate tracking and a new set of customizable breathing exercises, but the app itself is buggy.\nEvery time I've gone to open the app, it requires the Moonbird device to reconnect to the app, which takes a few seconds and is a real pain. Plus, it has a limited library of knowledge compared to apps like Headspace or Calm, so while the accompanying app is an added bonus, it doesn't add much value to the Moonbird's $199 price tag.\nIs the Moonbird worth it?\nThe Moonbird might be worth it if you want a distraction-free breathing tool. It is effective and takes the thinking out of your breathing exercise, but other devices with similar functionality cost a lot less. We recently tested the Dodow, a light-based breathing device, which we thought was expensive at $60. Considering the Moonbird is $199, it's hard to justify its cost when it has a design we're skeptical of \u2014 and one you can't use in public.\nHowever, the Moonbird's screen-free design is a huge boon. If you've tried meditation apps, tired of their screen time, and want a silent, distraction-free alternative, the Moonbird might be a worthwhile investment."

      "text": "TikTok creator Tess Gigone does it all with an iPhone and an Octobuddy\nI love when my FYP serves me up exactly what I want. That's how it felt when Tess Gigone's videos graced my feed. From her home kitchen in Canada, Gigone takes a laid-back approach to home cooking, whether it's a simple lunch for her and her husband or an elaborate pavlova to bring to a family dinner.\nAnd Gigone is my favorite type of influencer. Rather than pedaling products on TikTok Shop or pushing a certain lifestyle, she shares things that are genuinely delicious and joyful. Her easy-going videos have inspired me to try new recipes that have become staples in my weekly meal rotation.\nSince first discovering Gigone two years ago, her following has exploded to 575.7K on TikTok, earning 33.2M likes in the process. Through her kitchen, we've seen Gigone make hundreds of delicious meals and watch her family grow. Now, Gigone has a one-year-old daughter and her own series with Food52, It's Fine.\nIn between her travels, I caught up with Gigone to talk about the essential products for her content creation. With her background in photography, she shared her favorite camera and all the tools she needs for filming.\niPhone 16 Pro Max\nRather than an extensive camera set-up, Gigone takes a simpler approach to filming her content. For her, there's no need for an external vlogging camera. All her filming is done on her smartphone.\n\"I film everything on my phone, which usually surprises people! Until recently, I was using an iPhone 12 Pro, but I just upgraded to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and I'm feeling very fancy about it,\" she says.\nAdobe Premiere Pro\nWhile some creators use TikTok or Reels' native editing tools, Gigone prefers editing on the computer: \"For editing, I'm definitely a computer person. I'm not sure how anyone could edit on their phone \u2014 my thumbs are not that precise. Adobe Premiere Pro is my go-to software.\"\nOctobuddy\nWith limited space in her kitchen, there's no room for a tripod. Luckily, an Octobuddy, the suction-cup phone attachment, is the perfect fix: \"[My] most essential tool is [the] Octobuddy phone mount, which lets me film almost anywhere. Most of my videos happen in my kitchen, where I attach my phone to the window in front of me.\"\nBoos Block\nSpeaking of the kitchen, with such limited space, the tools that Gigone keeps nearby while filming are also essential. \"Since my kitchen is tiny, I try to keep the counter space clear when filming so I have room to actually cook. My Boos cutting board is always visible in my videos,\" Gigone says.\nFuji X100VI\nBefore (and while) her content started blowing up on TikTok, she worked as a photographer. While that path has taken a back seat to motherhood and content creation, in a recent video, Gigone unboxed the Fuji Film X100VI camera, and I wanted to know a little bit more about her purchase.\n\"I owned the Fuji X100V when it first released in 2020 and really loved it. I sold it when I was building up my professional equipment, but I've missed having it. Now that I've streamlined my gear, it felt like the right time to bring a Fuji back into my collection. It's a great balance of being compact enough to carry anywhere but still capable of professional-quality images,\" she says.\nLiffner Sprout Tote\nGigone graciously squeezed in time to chat with Mashable in between traveling. As she's on the go, she's got to have all her essentials in one spot: \"Having a one-year-old means my bag needs to fit practically everything. My current favorite is the Liffner Sprout tote, which balances function and style nicely.\"\nYou can find Gigone on Instagram and TikTok under the username @tessmadalyn.\nTopics Creators\nBoston-based Shopping Reporter, Samantha Mangino, covers all things tech at Mashable, rounding up the best products and deals.

      "text": "This stylish wall charger fixes my biggest problem with USB-C chargers\nAs Mashable's Tech Editor, I have way too many charging cables, power blocks, and USB-C blocks in my apartment. But there aren't many that I actually like to use. While most chargers are simply necessary evils, only one of these products has earned permanent status in my bedside AC outlet.\nThe Charger, from under-the-radar brand Counterpart, solves the biggest problem with most USB-C wall chargers \u2014 it features a retractable cable that snakes up inside the device when it's not in use. That means no annoying cable cluttering up your desk, countertops, or bedroom. It's one of those ingenious product innovations that makes you wonder, \"Why aren't all chargers like this?\"\nYou have to be pretty confident in your charger to name it The Charger. And I think it's worthy of the name. Because on top of its innovative design, this puck-shaped charger also looks attractive, which isn't something I can say about any other charging product I own. (And, again, there are so many).\nThis 35W USB-C charger features a retractable four-foot ribbon cable. When not in use, simply press a button on the front of the device, and the cable retracts like a tape measure. As you can see in my video review, it's immensely satisfying. And as a GaN charger, it offers more efficient charging than the average device. While you can find some chargers with retractable cables for cars, this is one of the only options for the home.\nYes, the $44 price tag may give you pause, but it's well worth it for a product that's attractive, functional, and comes with a two-year warranty. These chargers also make great gifts, especially if you're looking for stocking stuffers or under-$50 gift ideas.\nThe Charger comes in five different color options and can be purchased at the Counterpart online store.\nTopics Gadgets\nTimothy Beck Werth is the Tech Editor at Mashable, where he leads coverage and assignments for the Tech and Shopping verticals.

      "text": "My favorite Nintendo Switch 2 accessory is the Belkin charging case\nA few weeks ago, I finally got my hands on a Nintendo Switch 2. I absolutely love it so far, but up until now, I hadn't been able to use one of its key features: The ability to take the handheld anywhere.\nOf course, that's not entirely true. I technically could've taken the console on the go with me for the whole time I've had it, but I personally couldn't. In other words, there's no way in hell that my paranoid self was going to bring my new Nintendo Switch out into the world without a carrying case. (In my opinion, every Switch should come with a case, but making us buy everything separately is on-brand for Nintendo.)\nThe days of my Nintendo Switch 2 being a homebody are over, though, because Belkin's new charging case is just the thing I needed to feel comfortable traveling with my precious console. I never know what to expect when it comes to third-party accessories \u2014 they can be hit or miss \u2014 but this one is a home run.\nFirst off, the case itself looks great. The durable, hardshell exterior is sleek and not overcrowded with graphics and branding, which I tend to like a lot more than a maximalist approach. It comes in three different color options \u2014 I got the one in sand, but I think the charcoal and pistachio green variants are really cool, too. The real star of the show is inside the case, though.\nOnce you open it up, you'll find an integrated rechargeable power bank nested in the center, secured by a small velcro strap. The Switch console fits over it perfectly and doesn't scratch against anything when placed in the case. When you're in need of some extra juice, you can thread the included USB-C cord out from under the handheld and start charging either while you play or while it's sitting in the case. It's super convenient, and being able to safely charge my Switch while I'm out and about means I get to spend more time actually using the console and less time waiting for it to fuel up. The battery even has a small LCD display that tells you exactly how much power it has left, which has already saved me from accidentally leaving my apartment with a dead power bank.\nThe case also has a nice amount of extra storage, including a mesh pocket that can hold cords, accessories, and more. I personally use mine to store the battery cord, a charging block for when I need to plug the power bank in, and my Joy-Con covers that are meant to be used for the Switch's mouse mode. There's also an extra flap in front of the pocket that can hold up to 12 Nintendo Switch game cards. While the only games I have at the moment are digital copies, I'm excited to start filling up those card slots with new titles soon.\nIt's not like Belkin's case is totally revolutionary \u2014 we've seen charging cases before \u2014 but it is well-made, convenient, and the best one you're going to find at the start of the Switch 2 era.\nTopics Gaming Nintendo Nintendo Switch Video Games\nDylan Haas is a Lead Shopping Reporter for Mashable, where he covers all things gaming, laptops, fitness, and shopping events like Black Friday and Prime Day.

      "text": "Table of Contents\nWill the e-reader future be in glorious e-ink color?\nProbably, but the question of how soon was top of mind as I tested the Kobo Libra Colour, the first color e-reader from a major brand. (Color e-ink e-readers and tablets like the Pocketbook Ink Pad Color 2 and BOOX Tab Ultra C have been around, but generally at a higher price point with a more sluggish performance).\nI should also disclose my bias upfront: As a lifelong reader and someone who majored in English, I am unfortunately hardwired to have a superiority complex about preferring physical books. And though that will likely forever be a part of me, I\u2019d be lying if I said that the Kobo Libra Colour didn't help me read in moments I would\u2019ve been scrolling through my phone, and significantly upped my annotation game.\nHowever, along with the Kobo Clara Colour, the Libra is the brand\u2019s first crack at a color e-reader, so it\u2019s not without its flaws. Whether or not they\u2019re enough to dissuade you from picking it up largely depends on what you want out of your e-reader, so let\u2019s jump into the specifics.\nHow much does the Kobo Libra Colour cost?\nIf this e-reader put a premium price tag solely because it offers color e-ink, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Luckily, this isn't the case, and at $219.99, it feels more than competitively priced with Kindle's offerings. Here\u2019s how it breaks down:\nKobo Libra Colour: $219.99, $289.99 with Kobo Stylus 2 (sold separately for $69.99)\nKindle Paperwhite Signature Edition: $189.99\nKindle Scribe with Basic Pen: $339.99\nWe\u2019ll get more into performance and hardware differences below, but cost-wise alone, the Kobo Libra sits just over $30 more than the Kindle Paperwhite (which we admittedly love but has no color or tablet-like abilities) and $120 less than the Scribe (which has the writing abilities of the Kobo Libra without the color). Plus, the Kindle Scribe\u2019s Premium Pen is a better analog to the Kobo Stylus 2, but the addition of the better pen brings the Scribe\u2019s price up to $369.99, making the Kobo a full $150 cheaper.\nHonestly, my expectations were that the Amazon Kindles would be a better value: for starters, Kindles don\u2019t offer color e-ink yet, and it\u2019s no secret that Amazon treats its books side of the business as a loss leader. But Kobo surprised me, restraining itself from overpricing a color e-reader and making it more than competitively priced with Kindles.\nAlong with the e-reader itself, Kobo sent me the Kobo Stylus 2, which as I mentioned above, costs $69.99. They also sent me the Kobo Libra Colour Sleepcover, which retails for $39.99 and worked as an excellent kickstand in both portrait and landscape mode.\nKobo Libra Colour specs\nThe Kobo's competitive cost falls in line with what it's offering beyond the color display. The basic overview of what this e-reader offers includes:\n7-inch E Ink Kaleido 3 screen\n300 PPI (pixels per inch) for black-and-white content\n150 PPI for color content color content\n32GB of storage\nBluetooth compatibility\nDark mode available\nYou might notice that the color screen isn't made by Kobo, which is why you can find the exact same Kaleido 3 on other e-ink devices \u2014 however, as I mentioned up top, they're usually more expensive, and generally, Kobo seems to offer the most streamlined e-reader experience.\nAs for a comparison with the rest of the specs, the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition has a 6.8-inch 300 PPI display with 32GB of storage and an estimated 10 weeks of battery life. It's nearly identical, but Kindle does have one over Kobo here: in the roughly two and a half months I used the Kobo (about 10 weeks), I charged it twice.\nThat said, I didn't give the battery its best chance \u2014 in most cases, the WiFi and Bluetooth were on when I read, mostly because I was trying to use the device as I would normally, and realistically, that would not include optimizing its battery life. Depending on the time of day my brightness could be at 75 percent or 5 percent, so that fluctuated greatly too. Though I wish it lasted a little longer, about five weeks of continuous use under those conditions is still pretty decent.\nHow much color do you get with the Kobo Libra Colour?\nThe display is arguably the draw of this particular e-reader, so naturally, it's garnered some mixed opinions.\nOnline, you'll find folks who say the technology still isn't there with the Kaleido 3 screen, with the colors appearing washed out and grainy. Defenders of the Libra Colour will say you shouldn't expect iPad-level performance and that finding the right brightness setting goes a long way.\nPersonally, I find myself falling more into the defender camp, but rather than try to describe why, I figure some pictures might help me make my case. For starters, the highlights and annotations looked great:\nBefore we get more into the next pictures, I need a second to sing the praises of how nice highlighting and switching highlighter colors felt, especially with the Kobo Stylus 2. Writing notes in the margins, on the other hand, was just OK: Some lag (which I'll get more into below) and truly subpar palm rejection soured the experience, but I appreciated that all my highlights and annotations were saved in one long list.\nAs for how the display looked beyond annotations, book covers on the lock screen came through clearly, even when in the direct sun:\nEven compared to the cover of the physical book, I could play around with the brightness of the Kobo to get a relatively accurate recreation.\nObviously, the display isn't one-to-one with the color saturation of the real thing, but I was still pleasantly surprised. The above side-by-side honestly feels like the least favorable comparison I was able to draw out of the Kobo \u2014 most times, when I saw my lock screen with the title of whatever book I happened to be reading at the moment, I was impressed.\nWith that said, devout graphic novel readers or fans of full-color manga might prefer to stick to an iPad if they want the most vibrant color possible. I saw the comparison of the Kobo offering newspaper-esque color ink, and that feels fairly apt \u2014 if you expect that level of color saturation, you won't be let down.\nThe \u201cscreen door\u201d display\nOf course, most of the time, when you're reading an e-reader you won't be seeing color. So how does the Kobo stack up with black and white material?\nAs I mentioned above, the resolution is the same that you'll find on a Kindle Paperwhite. However, some people find the Kobo's display leans warm whereas they prefer the truer black-and-white display of a Kindle. I didn't have a Kindle to compare, but I felt like I was able to adjust the warmth of the screen to my preferences easily.\nHowever, if you've spent any time on r/Kobo, you'll know a particular gripe of e-reader enthusiasts is that Kobo has the \"screen door\" effect. The effect is what it sounds like \u2014 there's a faint grainy quality to the \"page\" that again, gives an almost newspaper-like look to the display, where a Kindle might look more akin to a standard tablet display.\nTo be clear, this doesn't really affect the sharpness of the words themselves. Some folks online mentioned that this graininess made them return their Kobo altogether. While it didn't bug me at all, I can see where having the other preference would turn me off from this e-reader. My advice? Go with a Kindle if you know you like a razor-sharp display.\nThe tablet features aren't there yet\nEven though some features were promising, I have to agree with what Mashable\u2019s Alex Perry said about the Kindle Scribe last fall: e-readers just aren\u2019t comparable to tablets yet.\nWhen using the notebook feature on the Kobo, you can pick from over 35 page formats, five different pen types, five pen sizes, four highlighter colors, and 10 pen colors. While I appreciate that the tablet-like functions allow the Libra to offer more ways to use its color e-ink than the Clara Colour, compared to an iPad or on its own merit, writing on a Kobo isn't nearly as fluid for note-taking or drawing. Plus, as I mentioned above, the palm rejection sucks.\nIn other words, it's hard to see the use case where someone would turn to their Kobo as the place to jot down their to-do lists, meal plans, or Cornell notes over a tablet or a notebook.\nThe other major issue that keeps the Kobo from being a viable notebook replacement is the display's occasional ghosting issue. While I really didn't notice a lot of ghosting throughout testing, it cropped up randomly when I was messing around with the notebook features: once, when I was using the resize tool, and another time when I was using the Kobo stylus to erase some text I'd written.\nI was especially surprised by the erasing ghosting \u2014 I'd erased plenty of annotations in highlights in e-books with the Kobo stylus and found it to work incredibly well. My guess is that the Kobo's system isn't powerful enough to support to smooth notebook experience it tries to offer.\nKindle vs. Kobo: Pros and cons\nI've already pointed out some key differences between the two e-readers throughout this review, but there are a few more factors to take into consideration beyond the display and battery life.\nLibrary book support\nIf you read a lot of library books, the Kobo might be for you for one simple reason: integrated Libby (formerly OverDrive) support. On a Kobo, you can place holds, check out, and download library books directly from your device, which is way more convenient than checking out books via the Libby app like you have to with the Kindle. If you happen to prefer using the Libby app, it syncs with the Kobo without issue.\nThat said, I'd still appreciate the option to add more than one library card at a time to the Kobo, especially as the Libby app supports that exact functionality.\nEPUB files\nKindles can't read EPUBs, Kobos can. What that means is that it's much easier for you to access and download files to the Kobo from outside the Kobo store. Whether that be an article or a short story, adding an EPUB file is as easy as uploading it to your Google Drive and seeing it show up directly on your Kobo.\nI was skeptical that this process would be one of those features that in theory sounds simple and actually requires an hour of troubleshooting to set it up, but I was able to grab a PDF of an essay without a hitch and watch it load up on my home screen.\nPocket integration\nSpeaking of articles, as an avid Pocket user prior to any e-reader use, I was stoked when I found out that the app is integrated with Kobo e-readers.\nThe syncing process between my Pocket app and the Kobo was basically seamless, whether I was saving articles from the browser on my laptop or from my phone. I could favorite, archive, and delete articles directly from the Kobo, and the color display added a nice touch when I was viewing everything I'd saved.\nThe major downside was that the Pocket app didn't support any annotation, so I couldn't mark up any articles the same way I'd enjoyed doing with books and EPUB files. Still, considering that Amazon doesn't offer this kind of Pocket integration at all, this felt like a minor gripe.\nAmazon's catalog\nWhere Amazon does have a huge advantage is its catalog. As Deputy Shopping and Reviews Editor Miller Kern mentioned in her comparison between the two brands, Kindle's catalog is simply bigger. This is especially apparent as Kindle Unlimited, the brand's subscription service, offers over 4 million digital titles to Kobo Plus's 1.5 million.\nYou can also buy e-books directly from your Kindle, while Kobo requires you to scan a QR code to buy them on a phone or computer.\nHonorable mentions\nA few more rapid-fire odds and ends that might sway you to one e-reader over the other: the Kobo Libra Colour has page-turning buttons, which Kindle doesn't currently offer (RIP, Kindle Oasis). These buttons work without a hitch in landscape, portrait mode, or even upside down, and can be programmed to suit what makes the most sense for you.\nSpeaking of design, I liked that the Kobo's on button was on the back of the device so I couldn't never accidentally lock the device (the Kindle's sits on the bottom, and is much more prone to that issue).\nFinally, I appreciated that the stylus magnetically attached to the Kobo and the sleep cover they sent me \u2014 sometimes, if I placed it wrong on the button side it would rest on the button and turn a bunch of pages, so a fix for that in a future generation would be great to see. However, it was easy to troubleshoot by placing it on the left side of the tablet while reading, and keeping it on the case when I wasn't using the device.\nIs the Kobo Libra Colour worth it?\nI'll keep it short and sweet: the Kobo Libra Colour is definitely a first-generation product with a few issues to work out, especially with its notebook feature. However, if you love using your library card, marking up your books, appreciate a color display, and prefer page turn buttons to a full touch screen experience, you'll likely be happy with the Kobo Libra Colour.\nFor folks who want the best unlimited subscription service, don't like a newsprint-like look, and prioritize the most vibrant colors possible when reading comics or manga, you'd likely be better off with a Kindle or a traditional tablet until Kobo (or another brand) improves on the color e-reader."

      "text": "It\u2019s no secret that skincare is trending right now, and a quick glance at social media proves it. Celebrities and influencers alike have hopped on the \u201cskincare as self-care\u201d train, and the resulting swarm of must-have products can be overwhelming to say the least. From the best Korean beauty products to the latest skincare gadgets, there\u2019s a lot to choose from. However, while skincare has (thankfully) come a long way from scrubbing your skin off with microbeads, it hasn\u2019t gotten any easier to decide if a product is nothing but hype or a true holy grail.\nEnter Solawave\u2019s advanced skincare wand with red light therapy. Touted as a science-backed, four-in-one skincare tool, this tiny wand is on a mission to be the next must-have in your medicine cabinet. (Since this review originally published, Solawave has released its new Radiant Renewal skincare wand, which is an upgraded version of the original wand.)\nSo how does it work?\nAs a novice skincare enthusiast, I was definitely intrigued by the Solawave the first time I saw it on social media. It was cheaper than many of the skincare devices I\u2019d seen in the past, and \u2014 with celebrities like Doja Cat, Vanessa Hudgens, and Reese Witherspoon reportedly loving the device \u2014 I immediately wanted to know more. The company\u2019s website explains that the tiny device combines four different skincare technologies \u2014 red light therapy, microcurrents, facial massage, and therapeutic heat \u2014 to provide what the company describes as the \u201cultimate at-home spa facial.\u201d\nI\u2019d heard about all of these techniques in the past. Red light therapy, for example, is touted as a way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles, scars, redness, acne, and more. And microcurrent facials? I\u2019ve heard some people swear that zapping a low-level electrical current through your skin is better than botox.\nHowever, while none of these technologies are new \u2014 and the science behind them definitely shows promise \u2014 I also have a healthy dose of skepticism around whether or not a tiny pen-sized wand can deliver the same results as professional-grade equipment.\nI put it to the test\nStraight out of the box, I was surprised at how tiny the Solawave was in my hand. Just over the size of a pen with a convenient swivel head, the tiny device uses \u201csmart-touch activation\u201d meaning it turns on and off when the ceramic head comes into contact with your skin. After charging the device according to the instructions in the package, it was time to get to work.\nWhile the Solawave turns on immediately when it comes into contact with your skin, the company explains that it works best on hydrated skin. Rather than fuss around with finding the right product, I opted to stick with their recommended Renew Complex Activating Serum. With ingredients like blue tansy oil, hyaluronic acid, and Aloe vera, the serum is designed to help evenly distribute the microcurrent therapy across your skin, so I washed and dried my face, applied a thin layer of the serum, and got started.\nHow does it feel?\nI\u2019m not going to lie, the first few seconds of swiping the Solawave wand across my skin felt odd. I was expecting a stronger sensation due to the microcurrent, but it felt like a gentle tingling sensation spreading out from the smooth ceramic head of the device. The device felt warm against my skin \u2014 it gradually increased in temperature the longer I used it \u2014 without being hot or uncomfortable.\nI started using the wand at the base of my neck, following the instructions in the package to glide it upward and outward as I gradually moved along each side of my face. During my first session, I started small \u2014 Solawave recommends starting with a five-minute session, three to five times a week \u2014 and I found that I actually enjoyed the process.\nIt was super relaxing to use the device on my face and neck, and it almost felt like the device was making it easier for my skin to absorb the products I was using, so my skin felt way more hydrated than normal.\nBut does it actually work?\nImmediately after using the red light therapy wand, I was surprised to find that I noticed a slight improvement in my skin. It wasn\u2019t dramatic or anything \u2014 if I hadn\u2019t taken a selfie earlier that evening, I probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed \u2014 but there was a visible reduction in puffiness around my eyes, cheeks, and jawline.\nOver the next two weeks, I diligently included the Solawave in my skincare routine. I used it both morning and evening, typically right after washing my face and applying a toning essence and the Renew Complex serum, around five or six days a week. Eventually, I started extending my Solawave sessions by a few minutes at a time \u2014 adding some focused attention to areas of my face that were holding tension, needed some extra de-puffing, or looked a little dehydrated \u2014 and I was surprised by how well it worked.\nBy the end of my second week, my skin was definitely looking better: A few hormonal acne scars on my chin had faded, the redness in my cheeks went down, and I swore to my partner that a broken capillary on my cheek had completely disappeared. On days when my seasonal allergies had me waking up with puffy bags under my eyes, I was thrilled to discover that the Solawave was a great way to quickly knock them out. While I didn\u2019t notice a huge difference in fine lines or wrinkles (at 32, I only have a few fine lines on my face that are noticeable when I\u2019m dehydrated) I was still shocked by how well the device worked.\nI used the red light wand, which is designed to reduce the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, dark circles, blemishes, and dark spots. But Solawave also offers a three-minute spot treatment device, which uses red and blue light to target acne-causing bacteria, and used to offer a blue light wand (meant to fight against breakouts, boosts the effects of serum topicals, and improve your skin's radiance), which has tragically been discontinued.\nThe Solawave wand is one of my skincare staples\nAfter months of using the Solawave red light therapy wand, it's officially a staple in my weekly skincare routine. I don't always remember to use it daily \u2014 mostly because my work schedule got busy and my skincare routine took a hit \u2014 but I use it whenever I need to depuff, prep for an event, or simply need to unwind. I've also discovered that I love using it after applying a face mask \u2014 especially when my skin is feeling dry \u2014 so I can really pack in any leftover serum on my skin. Since I first started trying the Solawave wand, I've also convinced several friends (and three other Mashable editors and writers) to buy the wand. One friend told me that it helped heal the hyperpigmentation and bumpiness she had after a bad bout of hormonal acne, adding, \"I use it after moisturizing almost every evening, and the difference is VERY noticeable.\"\nI've also tried a few other light therapy devices over the last few months, like the celeb-favorite DRx SpectraLite FaceWare Pro, and the Solawave is way more convenient and budget-friendly. It's definitely not as powerful as professional red light therapy treatments at your dermatologist's office \u2014 and you definitely need to remember to clean it regularly or risk an acne breakout (having learned that lesson the hard way) \u2014 but it's a great tool that has definitely changed my skin for the better.\nIs it worth it?\nHonestly, I\u2019ve got to say yes, the Solawave is worth it. I\u2019ve seen several at-home skincare devices, including red light therapy masks and microcurrent facial devices, that cost anywhere from $200 to $500. Compared to these, the Solawave advanced skincare wand\u2019s $149 price tag is a breeze. It\u2019s still a little more expensive than the beauty devices you might see on the shelf at Target, but considering how well it worked, it\u2019s definitely worth the splurge.\nIf you want to save a few bucks, you can also swap out Solawave\u2019s Renew Complex serum with one of your own favorites. At $32 a bottle, it\u2019s a little pricey compared to my favorite serums, and I didn\u2019t notice much of a difference when I started experimenting with a few I already had on hand. Thankfully, the company\u2019s website says it\u2019s totally fine to swap in your own products \u2014 especially if they contain conductive ingredients to help make the most of the microcurrent technology \u2014 so you can try using it with products that you already know work well with your skin.\nIf you\u2019re still on the fence? I\u2019d recommend following Solawave on social media or checking out the website. The company frequently offers sales on its products, so you might be able to save a bit of money by snagging a discount code on the website. Plus, since the new Radiant Renewal wand came out, the original Solawave wand is discounted to $89.\nTopics Beauty Reviews Mashable Choice"

      "text": "We tested the most popular Ninja appliances in our own kitchens. Here's what we found.\nOverview\nNinja Luxe Caf\u00e9 Premier 3-in-1 Espresso and Coffee Maker\nTable of Contents\nThe popularity of Ninja and Shark appliances is undeniable. The brand touches nearly every room in your home. It makes vacuums to keep your floors clean, air purifiers to refresh the air, hair stylers for at-home blowouts, and an appliance for every step of the cooking process. But with such an expansive catalog, it can be hard to sort through the best of the brand.\nWe wanted to test our way through the best Ninja had to offer in kitchen appliances. We brought the most popular products from the brand into our kitchens to see how the Creami, Slushi, and Foodi stacked up.\nHere are the best Ninja kitchen appliances we tested.\nEach device on this list was tested by a Mashable expert. To thoroughly evaluate each device, we used them in our kitchen for weeks at a time. We cooked a variety of meals in each appliance and assessed the following qualities in each device:\nDid the device have a learning curve? How much set-up did it require? Are its parts dishwasher safe?\n: Does the device have multiple uses? How effective is it at each use?\nHow large is the device? Is it difficult to store in small spaces?\nHow does its price match up with its overall functionality? If it's expensive, does it offer multi-functionality? Or if it's cheap, is it still effective?\nNinja Swirl\nBest Creami\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Makes ultra-creamy ice cream\n- Doesn't require re-spins like previous models\n- All parts are dishwasher-safe\n- Easy to use\n- It's still really loud\n- Takes up a lot of counter space\n- No mix-ins available with soft serve\n- Not fit to serve a crowd\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Ninja Swirl.\nWho it's for\nIf you are an ice cream enthusiast, in need of a sweet, frozen treat every night, you need the Ninja Swirl. It builds off Ninja's existing Creami technology to spin and churn your homemade pints of ice cream, froyo, and fruit whip. However, the Swirl also has a soft serve dispenser for serving up creamy, fluffy swirls of ice cream. It's the most impressive Creami for the hosts with the most, but it's also just straight-up fun.\nWhy we like it\nHaving tested both the Creami and the Swirl, the latter is my preferred ice cream maker from Ninja. Its ease of use is exceptional. To use, mix up your concoctions and let the pints freeze for 24 hours. Once frozen, put them in the Creami, where a blade spins through the ice cream to give it a fluffy, smooth texture.\nAny model in the Creami lineup is great, but the Swirl is the best because it nails texture. The Swirl manages to get more into the pints when spinning them for a light and spreadable treat. When making my favorite chocolate hazelnut frozen yogurt, it only needed one spin in the Swirl to get the perfect texture. Previously when I used the Ninja Creami Deluxe I needed to spin the ice cream several times to get the perfect whipped consistency.\nMy caution to those interested in a Ninja Swirl is that it's expensive and quite large, occupying a lot of counter space. However, for an ice cream aficionado, it'll be a worthwhile investment. And word of warning: it's so loud, but that will be the case for any Ninja Creami model you go for.\nDetails\nNinja Detect Kitchen System Blender\nBest blender\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Multi-use tool\n- Base has suction\n- Dishwasher Safe\n- Powerful motor\n- Blendsense doesn't always work\nWho it's for\nIf you're trying to make the decision between investing in a blender or a food processor, the answer is to get both and get them with the Ninja Blender Kitchen System. This blender is for the kitchen multitasker who wants to do it all without shelling out money for multiple appliances. It's for beginners and kitchen professionals alike, as you can use manual settings or use BlendSense technology to take the thought out of it.\nWhy we like it\nMaybe it's because I've been an apartment dweller for so long, but my biggest pet peeve is a one-use appliance. If you're going to invest in a new kitchen tool, you want it to work overtime. That's why I adore the Ninja Detect Kitchen System, it's a full-sized blender, food processor, and personal blender.\nHaving owned and used multi-use kitchen appliances, I find that you sometimes have to make some sacrifices and lose features. That's not the case with the Ninja Detect Kitchen System. It has an incredibly powerful motor and no matter what attachment you're using, you can choose from a variety of settings with each attachment.\nThe device uses one base to run everything, which saves space on multiple bases. Just swap out the attachments, whether that be the personal-sized blade and cup or the big 72-ounce pitcher. It's exceptionally powerful and able to quickly mince vegetables or crush ice.\nWhile it's nice to have a single base for the different attachments, it saves space in one sense. However, beware that the attachments are still very large and take up quite a bit of room.\nDetails\nNinja Luxe Caf\u00e9 Premier 3-in-1 Espresso and Coffee Maker\nBest espresso and coffee machine\nThe Good & The Bad\n- 3-in-1 espresso, coffee, and cold brew maker\n- Grinder included with adjustable grind settings\n- Automated milk frothing\n- Beginner design\n- Expensive\n- Can't manually froth\n- Occasionally weak pressure\nWho it's for\nIf you've ever felt intimidated by using an espresso machine, the Ninja Luxe Caf\u00e9 Premier strikes the perfect balance of user-friendly design with high-end settings.\nPlus, if you're a divided household, with latt\u00e9 drinkers or drip coffee loyalists, this machine bridges the gap with the ability to grind and brew both espresso and coffee. This machine may not be for professional baristas, but it will be for someone who has expert taste but prioritizes convenience.\nWhy we like it\nWhile my partner and I are espresso enthusiasts, any time our parents come into town, we run into the problem of not having a good drip coffee setup. The Ninja Luxe Caf\u00e9 Premier is the ideal solution for offering both without any pods. Instead, it grinds beans to serve brew espresso, coffee, and cold brew. It has adjustable grind settings while providing suggested grind settings based on your chosen coffee setting \u2014 much easier than troubleshooting on a standard espresso machine.\nUsing the machine is pretty foolproof. While I do have a barista background and know my way around an espresso machine, I enjoyed just how easy it was to use. The machine tells you exactly how fine to grind your beans, grinds them, and then pulls an espresso shot with a rich layer of crema, all with the press of a button.\nMilk frothing is automated on the Luxe Caf\u00e9 Premier. The milk pitcher includes a steaming wand as well as a circular frother at the bottom. While I enjoyed the seamlessness of getting steamed milk, this is where the machine won't be for everyone. If you prefer to steam your own silky microfoam for latt\u00e9s, you won't be able to with this machine, as you can't angle the wand without placing the pitcher on its pedestal.\nOtherwise, I think this is a perfectly approachable machine that blends ease of use with a delicious finished product.\nDetails\nNinja Crispi\nBest air fryer\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Portable\n- Dishwasher safe\n- Makes food crispy on the outside, moist on the inside\n- Comes with storage lids\n- Great for reheating\n- Limited setting options\n- Largest size is still rather small\nWho it's for\nAir fryers are great for anyone, but the Ninja Crispi is made for meal preppers. With its portable design, it stores nicely and can be used on the go. Plus, it actually works. The controls are simple, and the glass baskets come with storage lids for easy food storage.\nWhy we like it\nThere are certain devices I look at and think, there's no way that's going to work, always hoping to be proven wrong. The Ninja Crispi is one of those devices, with its glass basket and air-frying lid, I was skeptical of its efficacy. I'm pleased to say I was wrong. It delivered food that was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.\nWhen it comes to testing air fryer crispiness, my go-to trials are always tofu and frozen French fries. The Ninja Crispi handled both with flying colors. In less than 20 minutes, it air-fried cubes of tofu tossed in cornstarch to crunchy perfection. Frozen French fries also turned out great. I tossed a handful in to fill up the container, not bothering to lay them without any overlap, and still, the Ninja Crispi made every fry perfectly crispy on the outside while remaining soft on the inside.\nAir fryers are an appliance of convenience, able to get food hot and crispy quickly, and the Ninja Crispi maximizes that with its design that allows you to meal prep and store food directly into glass baskets, where you will then reheat it. The storage containers are all dishwasher safe, a rare trait in air fryer baskets.\nCompared to other air fryers, the settings on this device may be a little limited, as you can't adjust the temperature. However, I have tested the Crispi on a variety of foods, and I didn't miss being able to adjust the temperature.\nDetails\nNinja Foodi Everyday PossibleCooker Pro\nBest multicooker\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Cooks quickly\n- Pot is oven safe\n- Can sear and saut\u00e9\n- Large capacity\n- Handwashing is recommended\nWho it's for\nSo you only have space for one appliance in your kitchen, and you can't decide between a rice cooker and a slow cooker? Choose the Ninja Foodi Everyday Possible Cooker. This device doesn't look like a lot, essentially a hot plate and non-stick pot, but it's incredible how much it can do. It makes rice in the blink of an eye, can boil a pound of pasta, and slow-cooks food to tender perfection.\nWhy we like it\nNinja makes some big claims with the Ninja Foodi Everyday PossibleCooker as it supposedly makes rice 50 percent faster than a traditional rice cooker. As the No. 1 fan of my rice cooker, I obviously had to test this claim first. The Ninja Foodi does indeed make rice 50 percent faster \u2014 almost.\nWhile my rice cooker cooked one cup of white rice in 25 minutes, the Ninja took just 15 minutes, and even better, it was perfectly fluffy without any overcooked crisp bits on the bottom. And it does much more than that. I made slow-cooked BBQ chicken, and it produced tender, moist chicken that was a crowd-pleaser.\nNinja has plenty of other multicookers, but this one is my favorite because it's the most affordable option and replaces multiple appliances at once.\nDetails\nNinja Thirsti\nBest sparkling water machine\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Adjustable carbonation level\n- Adjustable flavor settings\n- Holds two flavor containers\n- Water needs to be cold\n- Have to use Ninja-specific flavor pods\nWho it's for\nThere's a big camp of people who need their water to be flavored. If you happen to be in that group, then the Ninja Thirsti might prove itself to be an essential kitchen appliance. It delivers both sparkling and still options and can infuse water with flavor. There are subtle, unsweetened options like a hint of lime or caffeinated, sweet fruity options for at-home energy drinks.\nWhy we like it\nHaving previously used Sodastream carbonated drink makers, I was pleased by Ninja's higher-tech spin on CO2 machines. Rather than pumping CO2 into bottles of water, the Ninja Thirsti delivers personalized glasses of flavor-infused beverages. It allows you to adjust flavor and carbonation levels for a customized drink.\nThe flavor add-in is what sets the Ninja Thirsti apart from other drink makers. With others, you need to drop in flavor after carbonation, but the Ninja Thirsti infuses it right into your cup, taking out the guesswork of flavoring your drink. However, to use this feature, you have to use Ninja's own flavor pods.\nThere's one part of the Ninja Thirsti that I really don't like, and it's that the brand recommends using cold water for the best product. For room temperature water enthusiasts, this is not ideal. Plus, it requires refrigerating the water ahead of time, which requires some forethought. Not to mention, the water tank's lid isn't super secure, leaving it susceptible to spillage.\nOtherwise, this is a fantastic carbonated drink maker, best for the flavored water devotee.\nDetails\nNinja Slushi\nBest frozen drink maker\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Buttons and lights are very straightforward\n- Could easily incorporate this into my weekly wellness routine\n- Can just pour ingredients right in top\n- Slushies in less than an hour\n- Very quiet when running\n- Hand washing just involves four pieces\n- Recipe book has a lot of measuring guidelines for \"make your own\" drinks\n- No countdown timer\n- Whole process is a bit much for just making a drink for one person\n- Sugar and alcohol content math can get a little tricky\n- Doesn't work with diet soda or anything sugar-free\nOur review\nRead our review of the Ninja Slushi.\nWho it's for\nPut away the blender! If you're going to make frozen drinks this summer, let it be with the Ninja Slushi. It's a little extra but if you're looking to host all summer long and want something to impress your guests, do it with the Ninja Slushi, which freezes and spins drinks until they're icy.\nWhy we like it\nYou can make frozen drinks with a lot of different appliances, like a blender or a Ninja Creami, but the most foolproof way is with the Ninja Slushi. It's certainly not a necessary appliance, but if you're a frozen drink fanatic, it's essential.\nUnlike the Creami, it freezes drinks in the machine and churns them until it has the perfect slushy texture. It does require a bit of math work, as you need the right sugar or alcohol levels to perfect the texture.\nThat being said, at $349.99, it's quite expensive. As my colleague Leah Stodart pointed out, people pay twice that for an espresso machine, so depending on your enthusiasm for frozen drinks, it may be a worthy price to pay.\nDetails\nTopics Kitchen\nWhy buy Ninja?\nThere are plenty of kitchen appliance brands out there, so why Ninja? Generally, we find its products to be some of the best value products. They tend to be the most affordable options on the market that still deliver excellent performance.\nPlus, Ninja products are really beginner-friendly devices that are easy to use with minimal setup required. The appliances bring ease with delicious end products. The Creami is a perfect example of this. Traditional ice cream making requires a bit of skill, knowing how to cook custards to the right temperature with hours of churning. But the Creami simplifies ice cream making with a user-friendly product that still delivers a fantastic end result.\nJust because they're beginner-friendly devices doesn't mean they're only for beginners. They're convenient devices with professional-level performance that help develop a more efficient kitchen.\nOther products we tested\nHaving rounded up the best Ninja kitchen appliances means we tested a lot of products and not all of them made it to the list, two notable exceptions being the Ninja Creami Deluxe and Foodi Grill and Air Fryer.\nThe Ninja Deluxe was my introduction to the Creami lineup, and it is great. It spun up creamy frozen confections and even featured a frozen drink setting. However, compared to the Swirl, it required several re-spins to get the right texture.\nMeanwhile, the Foodi Grill was another great multicooker from Ninja. The indoor grill made delicious, juicy chicken breasts with actual char marks. Plus, its air-frying capabilities were a little too good. It got things crispy fast, but often felt like it dried out food in the process. Plus, it was just so large that it didn't feel like a practical device for most people.\nThat being said, these devices are good, but not in our all-star line-up.\nBoston-based Shopping Reporter, Samantha Mangino, covers all things tech at Mashable, rounding up the best products and deals. She\u2019s covered commerce for three years, spending extensive time testing and reviewing all things home, including couches, steam irons, and washing machines.

      "text": "Table of Contents\nKindles are the It Girl of the e-reader market. Of course, they have the power of Amazon behind them, but it isn't unwarranted. Having tested my way through almost all the e-readers on the market, it's clear that Kindles simply are the best.\nBut which Kindle is the best? Because yes, there is more than one. There's the entry-level Kindle, Kindle Colorsoft, Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Kindle Scribe, plus several kid's models. Last year, the line-up got an update and we can safely say that the new Kindle Paperwhite is the best option.\nThe new Kindle Paperwhite remains as good as ever, even if it's missing some updates we were hoping for. It's quick, lightweight, and easy to use. Here's why the Kindle Paperwhite is the best e-reader of the moment.\nKindle Paperwhite price and specs\nThe 2024 Amazon Kindle Paperwhite costs $159.99 for the ad-supported device, while the model without lock screen ads costs $179.99.\nIn the past, Amazon has offered different storage options for each Kindle model, but 16GB is the new standard, and to upgrade to 32GB, you have to opt for the Signature Edition. Now, the only choice you have to make when purchasing the Kindle Paperwhite is whether to have ads or go ad-free.\nNo matter which version you go for, these are the specs for the 2024 Paperwhite.\n7-inch display, up to 94 nits brightness and 300 ppi resolution (up from 6.8 inches on the 2021 model)\nUSB-C charging port with up to 12 weeks of battery life\n16GB of storage\nIPX8 waterproof rating can be fully submerged in water for up to one hour\nComes in black, raspberry, and jade\nIt's fast, with a vibrant screen\nBefore testing the 2024 Kindle Paperwhite, I thoroughly enjoyed the prior model, and I didn't think there was much to improve upon. It was already a quick-moving e-reader that made reading more convenient. However, the most significant upgrades come to the performance and screen.\nThe latest Kindle moves fast. The previous generation was already quick, so the 25 percent increase in speed isn't quite noticeable if you're moving from there, but it still improves the reading experience with far less loading in between page turns or stalling when opening and exiting books.\nWhile the brightness and resolution specs haven't changed from the previous model, the screen on the 2024 model does look higher resolution, edging closer to the resolution of a tablet and away from the classic, dim e-reader. The Paperwhite's screen still sports a matte finish that is as easy to read outside on a sunny day as in a dark bedroom.\nThe battery life can't be beat\nI don't think there is another device in my house that can go months without charging. My smartphone, smartwatch, laptop, and tablet all require daily charging. My smart ring and headphones can sometimes last up to a week, but months?! That's unheard of.\nYet, the Kindle Paperwhite manages to do it. Having tested the previous model, the new Kindle Paperwhite offers a couple of extra weeks of battery life. On average, I need to charge my Kindle Paperwhite every two to three months, and that's with near daily use.\nBuilding a library is cheap and convenient\nYou might not believe me when I say buying a $160 device makes your reading habit cheaper, but trust me when I tell you it will. The cost of a Kindle Paperwhite is the same as about five to six hardcover books, but luckily, Kindle e-books are a lot cheaper. If you plan on buying books from the Kindle store, eventually, the Kindle will earn itself in savings. Plus your purchases earn you points through the Kindle Rewards system, where every 300 points is turned into $3 in Kindle book credits. But there are even more affordable ways to read.\nAnother affordable reading option is the Kindle Unlimited Program. The subscription program lets users borrow books for as long as they want for a monthly fee of $11.99. You don't need a Kindle to use the program, as long as you have the Kindle app you can subscribe. However, with the purchase of a Kindle, you gain access to a free three-month trial.\nAmazon also has a First Reads program where Prime members get free early access to editor-selected e-books. During Prime Day months, members get to select two free books.\nPlus you can read library books with Libby on the Kindle Paperwhite.\nIs it the best e-reader for Libby?\nIn my opinion, Libby is the best app to ever exist. It connects you with digital loans from your local libraries, bringing e-books to your phone, tablet, or e-reader.\nYou can use Libby across all Kindle devices as the integration is the same on all models. But is the Kindle Paperwhite the best e-reader for Libby? It's got some competition from Kobo's e-readers.\nTo get your Libby books on a Kindle Paperwhite, you have to use the Libby app on your phone to then send the books to your Kindle. In terms of ease, Kobo has the Kindle slightly beat, as Overdrive (Libby's parent company) is integrated directly into the e-readers.\nHowever, the Kindle Paperwhite will be the best e-reader for Libby if you have multiple library cards. If you're borrowing on different accounts, it doesn't affect how you send your books to the Kindle. Unfortunately, the Kobo only supports one library account at a time, meaning you have to sign in and out of your account depending on where you're borrowing from.\nThe library interface is clunky\nAs much as I love how easy it is to read library books on my Kindle, they can also make the Kindle library clunky. After you read a library book and the loan expires, you won't be able to read the book. However, the cover still appears in your Kindle library.\nJust like I want my books tidy IRL, I want them organized on my e-reader, too. There's no filter to hide your library books on the Kindle. Instead, if you want to hide the expired titles, you need to make a collection in your Kindle library to separate your library books from those you own.\nThe Paperwhite is better than the Signature Edition for this one reason\nI have spent weeks with both the Paperwhite and the Signature Edition, and despite the SE's extra features, I prefer the Paperwhite. The reason is the ad-free lock screen. Yes, ads are annoying. However, the lock screen with ads forces you to swipe past the screen when you turn it on. This is different from the SE's screen, which automatically pushes past the lock screen when you hit the power button.\nOn its face, that sounds super convenient, saving you a step. That is until you throw the Signature Edition in your bag and pull it out to discover you've lost your page in your book because it accidentally turned on. Meanwhile, this was never an issue with the Paperwhite, which stayed locked while I was on the go.\nThis issue will be on any ad-free Kindle, not just the Signature Edition. You can add a PIN as a workaround, but like many users, I'd rather just swipe.\nAll these updates, but there's still room for improvement\nFrom the previous model, the Kindle Paperwhite remains our favorite e-reader. However, it's missing a few upgrades that I was really hoping to see. Amazon should have moved the power button to the top of the Kindle rather than keeping it on the bottom. I hit the power button while holding the device constantly because of its placement. It could be fine if the Kindle had an internal gyroscope like the Kobo Libra Colour does, and the Kindle could rotate the page, but alas, another missing feature.\nAnother perk the Kobo Libra has over the Kindle is page-turning buttons. Amazon devastated users by discontinuing the Kindle Oasis in June 2024, taking away the only Kindle with page-turning buttons. I was hopeful that meant this new batch of Kindles would feature buttons, but they're noticeably absent. While the buttons aren't necessary \u2014 the Kindle's touchscreen is plenty responsive \u2014 having the buttons is just a better reading experience, which is why, in terms of ergonomics, the Kobo Libra is much better.\nNone of these missing features are dealbreakers, but they do remind us that the Kindle Paperwhite isn't perfect.\nIs the Kindle Paperwhite worth it? Here are our final thoughts.\nThe Kindle Paperwhite is not just the best Kindle but the best e-reader overall. It's compact and lightweight, just the right size for toting around. The screen strikes the balance of tech and paper, and the adjustable warmth makes reading in the evening better for your eyes. With the release of the 2024 model, it's the fastest Kindle yet, which is good news. When you turn the physical page, it never buffers, so digital readers deserve the same.\nWhile Amazon still leaves some to be desired, it remains the best e-reader you can buy. It's $10 more expensive than the last model but is still a good value.\nTopics Amazon Books Mashable Choice Kindle"

      "text": "The cult-favorite Loftie alarm helped me kick my nighttime phone habit\nI'll be the first to admit that I did not need a $170 alarm clock to stop using my phone at night and actually get some good rest. After all, willpower is free, and in general, most alarm clocks are much cheaper.\nStill, I was intrigued by the Loftie Clock, from the positive reviews it received across the board, often citing its pleasant \"wakeup\" sounds that replace the classic blaring alarm. As a lifelong night owl who now works East Coast hours from Los Angeles, I made the case over and over to myself about why I should invest in one \u2014 but I could never quite get over the sticker shock.\nThat was until I came across Loftie's refurbished section. Combined with a coupon from the Shop app, I got the $170 Loftie down to $96 for a refurbished clock in \"Great\" condition. Though $96 is still steep, it was at least below triple digits, and after spending nearly a year with it, I'm convinced I'll use this alarm clock until it dies.\nThough it is technically a \"smart\" clock in that it can connect to an app, once I set it up with my phone, I can use all of its functions just with the clock. The biggest reason I wanted an alarm clock was so I could leave my phone outside of my bedroom at night, so this was a huge plus.\nWhat I appreciate most about this clock, however, was that it is maybe the only alarm I have ever used that doesn't jolt me awake. I have aspirations of being a person with a healthy REM cycle, but for the time being, I am not. If I want to wake up on time, I need an alarm. Unlike using a song to wake up (an excellent way to Pavlov yourself into hating the music you like) or a standard iPhone alarm (just generally grating), the Loftie clock comes with a two-alarm system that manages to nail the balance of soothing sounds that can actually wake you up.\nThe system works by playing an initial \"wakeup tone\" followed by a \"getup tone\", which plays either nine, six, three, or zero minutes after the first one, depending on your settings. If the wakeup tone is akin to a sound bath, the getup tone is a bird gently chirping outside your window. In other words, the reviews about this clock being downright pleasant to wake up to weren't lying.\nThe Loftie's display is minimal, and though it's tinier than most standard alarm clocks, I can still read it from about a foot away, squinting, if I happen to wake up in the middle of the night. (For anyone unimpressed by that, I have a -6.5 prescription in both eyes). The smaller display also means I don't deal with a glaring light in my room. Once I moved in with my partner, we found that he was slightly more sensitive to the light, but switching to the clock's red mode did the trick. There's also an option to turn off the display altogether if you're extra sensitive to light.\nThe features I've described so far are enough to make the clock worth it to me, and I say this as someone who's tried out other premium sleep tech. Additional features include:\nA bed signal alarm that can help remind you to wind down at night\nA Bluetooth speaker that allows you to stream audio directly from your phone\nA built-in night light that's easy to turn on and off in the middle of the night\nPreloaded sleep machine sounds, sound baths, and guided meditations\nExcellent customer service: I had a small issue connecting my clock to WiFi after a move, but when I reached out to the Loftie team (from my personal email), they responded within four minutes. You can also book 15-minute live support sessions if you need more hands-on help.\nThe option for a Loftie+ membership, which comes out to $5.99 per month or $49.99 per year\nIt's not an absolute necessity, but it's definitely one of the nicer luxuries I've treated myself to. With the amount of use I get out of it (and the hours I've saved myself from doomscrolling), I would make the decision to pay $96 for it all over again. (Though, I can't say I recommend buying the Loftie at full price.)\nTopics Gadgets\nBethany Allard is a Los Angeles-based shopping reporter at Mashable covering beauty tech, dating, sex and relationships, and headphones.

      "text": "Table of Contents\nI'll admit it: I miss the 2000s frozen yogurt craze. There was a shop on every corner and an endless array of flavors and toppings. I never thought the day would come when I could bring that joy home until I was introduced to the Ninja Swirl.\nAfter testing the Ninja Creami, I got used to having homemade frozen dessert on command. So when Ninja reached out about the debut of its latest Creami device, the Ninja Swirl, which lets you make soft serve at home, I was all ears.\nI got a sneak peek of the Ninja Swirl at the brand's event in early February, and it certainly got me hyped to bring it home. Now that I've tested it, here's what I think about the Ninja Swirl.\nHow does the Ninja Swirl work?\nThe Ninja Swirl builds off of the original Creami technology. Each Swirl comes with two pints to mix up your concoctions. Once filled, the pints must be frozen for 24 hours before you can \"spin\" them. You can think of the spinning process as a reverse blender. Instead of the blade sitting at the bottom, it comes down from the top, cutting and spinning through the ice cream until it's as creamy as what you buy from the store.\nEach Creami has a variety of settings, including ice cream, lite ice cream, frozen yogurt, sorbet, gelato, and milkshake. Plus, there are settings to re-spin if your mix is not the right texture or you want to add mix-ins.\nThe Swirl adds a new feature for dispensing soft serve. The pints that come with the Swirl all have a dispensing feature, which is utilized when you place them in the left-hand dispenser. Then, you pull the lever, and the machine pushes the ice cream out.\nHow is the Ninja Swirl different than the Creami?\nThe most significant difference between the Swirl and the standard Creami is the ability to make soft serve. The regular and deluxe Ninja Creami produce scoopable ice cream or frozen drinks, and the Swirl can do all of that, plus make soft serve. Part of the soft serve process is the inclusion of a soft serve dispenser that feels like you're working at an ice cream shop, with a handle to pull and everything.\nThe biggest difference between soft serve and regular ice cream is air. Soft serve adds more air to achieve a light and fluffy texture compared to denser ice cream. In standard ice cream making, air is added during the churning and freezing process; however, the Ninja Creami brings air into play during the spinning process.\nThe Ninja Swirl features a setting that adds more air to the product so it's ready to dispense as soft serve.\nIt's creamier than ever\nWhen I was first introduced to the Ninja Swirl, I was intrigued by the brand's claim that this new device added more air to the spinning process to replicate classic soft serve or froyo. I was cautiously optimistic about this but still hesitant. My previous experience with the Ninja Creami was that getting the right texture, one that's genuinely creamy and easy to scoop, requires at least one re-spin, but often more.\nSo when I first used the Ninja Swirl, I wanted to try my go-to Creami recipe for chocolate hazelnut froyo. I mixed plain Greek yogurt with a chocolate hazelnut spread and let it freeze for over 24 hours. When it came time to spin the pint, my jaw was on the floor when, after one spin, it turned out to be the smoothest ice cream (pictured above, right) I'd ever seen from a Creami. Usually, getting anywhere near that consistency requires multiple spins, and even then, it's still a little too thick (pictured above, left).\nNinja has clearly improved the technology between models and has struck gold. The spinning process is more powerful than ever on the Ninja Swirl, regardless of whether you're making soft serve or scoopable ice cream.\nYou never have to leave the house for soft serve again\nThere's nothing I love more than leaving the house on a late summer evening to indulge in a cone of soft serve. It's something you can't get at home, unlike a pint of ice cream you buy at the grocery store. But now, with the Ninja Swirl, I don't have to leave the house for soft serve.\nUsing the Ninja Swirl's soft serve feature is impossibly easy. After spinning your pint on the soft serve setting, install the soft serve lid attachment and install the whole pint into the dispensing portion. Then, using the lever on the right side of the machine, release the ice cream.\nI tried a couple of different recipes for the soft serve mechanism, both dairy and non-dairy. The creamiest was, unsurprisingly, the dairy-based froyo, which dispensed evenly without any air pockets to disrupt the flow of dispensing. The fruit whip I made, an ode to a Dole whip, still faired pretty well in the machine. It looked really smooth and silky after spinning, so I had high hopes when I went to dispense it.\nIt had a less consistent flow than the dairy recipe I made. Ninja warns users that they might hear some popping during the soft serve dispensing, just air pockets getting pushed out. I definitely experienced quite a lot of popping with the fruit whip, which resulted in a less consistent flow. My swirls weren't as pretty as they were with the froyo, but the ice cream's texture was fine while eating it. It just might not look as Instagrammable as other recipes.\nThat being said, using the soft serve dispenser is just straight-up fun. Pulling the lever and swirling the ice cream feels like you're back in the froyo shop.\nIt's made for meal preppers and protein maxxers\nThe Ninja Creami became an internet sensation through creators in the health and fitness space. Users see the device as a way to enjoy ice cream while still hitting their daily macros. At the Ninja event I attended, the brand doubled down on the Swirl's spot in the health space, collaborating with health and fitness creator John Jung to highlight the new Creamifit setting.\nCreamifit is designed to work best with recipes that include protein powders or shakes, which is a huge draw for users already tapping the Creami to make protein-focused desserts.\nI had an issue with the Creami in my first review: the pints require 24 hours of freezing before use, so it's not like you can just have some ice cream on a whim. That remains the case for the Ninja Swirl, so it's best fit for meal preppers who want to prep a few pints at the beginning of the week so they're ready to go when the mood strikes.\nIt isn't great for single servings \u2014 or a crowd\nThe only real drawback I've found to the Ninja Swirl's soft-serve feature is that it's not great for single servings or a crowd. At 16 oz, it's best used to produce four four-ounce servings. At the Ninja event, I noticed the Ninja team needed to swap out the pints after about four people served themselves. So, if you're planning on serving a crowd, prepare to have some backup pints ready.\nIf it's just you enjoying the soft serve, you'll have leftovers. The issue here is that the ice cream dispenses directly from the pint in which it's frozen. It gets pretty messy during dispensing, so it's not great to throw it back in the freezer like I would with the pints I used in the standard Creami.\nThat being the case, I found myself reaching for the Swirl a lot less during the week. When it's just me and my partner, we don't want to polish off a pint, just the two of us, and we don't want to deal with the messy leftover pint. So, I waited until we had a couple more people over before using the soft serve function.\nIf you want to enjoy the soft serve in single servings, I recommend having a clean pint on hand and moving your leftovers there after use.\nIt's still way too loud \u2014 and even bigger than before\nThe number one complaint you will hear about the Ninja Creami is its loudness. Imagine a powerful vacuum and then crank it up a couple of notches kind of loud. This makes it less than ideal for parents looking to sneak in a late-night snack when the kids are asleep, apartment dwellers sharing a wall with their neighbors, or pet owners. My cat seriously hates the Ninja Swirl, even if he begs me for the fruits of its labor.\nUnfortunately, the Swirl is just as loud as the Creami, as you can hear from the video above. While it's a total pain hearing it go on for six minutes, it's an unavoidable part of the Swirl and Creami experience.\nBecause of the addition of the soft serve dispenser, the Ninja Swirl is a lot bigger than the Creami. As an apartment dweller with already limited counter space, I may not be able to justify making the Swirl a permanent fixture in my kitchen. However, if you have endless counter or storage space or just really love ice cream, making room for it is a worthy sacrifice.\nIs the Ninja Swirl worth it?\nYes, the Ninja Swirl is worth it. Having tested both the standard Ninja Creami and the Ninja Swirl, the Swirl is the better investment as an ice cream maker. It has improved performance, requiring fewer re-spins to achieve a creamy consistency. Soft serve or froyo fiends will love the new dispensing feature, which is exceptionally easy to use and, not to mention, really fun.\nThere are certainly drawbacks, such as its size and how loud it is to use, but if you're prepared for both, there's no reason that it will inhibit your experience using it.\nIt will cost you $349.99; however, with the capability to make both soft serve and scoopable ice cream, it's the best-valued Creami device yet.\nTopics Mashable Choice Gadgets Kitchen"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nUnless you're an audio nerd, you might not be familiar with Technics, which is celebrating its 60th anniversary with the launch of new flagship earbuds \u2014 the EAH-AZ100 wireless earbuds. The buds debuted at the CES 2025 show in Las Vegas, and I've been testing them for the past few weeks.\nTechnics made the turntable used by DJs since the earliest days of hip-hop and electronic music. More recently, the Panasonic brand has focused on HiFi products for audiophiles. They make studio-quality wired earphones for professional musicians and engineers, as well as luxury speakers, amplifiers, and turntables.\nWith the AZ100s, Technics wants to bring true high-fidelity, reference-class music quality to an everyday product. But you don't have to be a pretentious audiophile (and I say that will all due respect to the pretentious audiophiles of the world) to appreciate these new wireless earbuds.\nBecause, damn, do they sound good.\nTechnics EAH-AZ100 wireless earbuds specs\nYou can start listening to music with these buds minutes after unboxing them. I've had no issues with pairing, dropped connections, or lag \u2014 even while using multi-point connections. They've also got an impressive feature set:\nSpeaker Driver Unit: 10mm\nFrequency Response: 20 to 40 kHz\nAdaptive Active Noise Cancellation\nIPX4 water resistance\n10 hours of battery with ANC / 28 hours of battery with charging case\n15-minute quick charge provides 90 minutes of ANC listening\nSupports LDAC lossless audio\nUSB-C and Qi wireless charging\nCharging case dimensions: 69 x 36 x 27 mm\nEarpiece sizes: XS, S, M, M/L, L\nColors: Black and silver\nThe Technics Audio Connect app is also super user-friendly, and the custom ANC, EQ settings, and Voice Focus AI features are simple to set up. Personally, I found the \"Dynamic\" audio setting worked best for music. When using the buds, I found the touch controls responsive \u2014 but not so responsive that I accidentally paused or skipped tracks.\nThe AZ100s produce high-fidelity audio for music lovers\nIn December, Panasonic invited a group of journalists to the Technics Design Studio in Kyoto, Japan, where we got to demo these new earbuds ahead of their CES debut. They deliver richer, fuller, more detailed sound than any earbuds I've ever tested. The only buds I've tried that achieved similar clarity and sound separation were next-gen in-ear monitors that used ultrasound technology.\nThat means when you're listening to a really layered track \u2014 think symphonies from Beethoven or \"National Anthem\" by Radiohead \u2014 you can distinctly hear all the various layers of sound. Instead of notes blurring into each other, you clearly hear each individual chord just as it was recorded.\nBasically, they pass the \"bop\" test. As in, how much do I bop my head and play air drums while using them? It can be hard to articulate exactly why HiFi music sounds so much better, but you know it when you hear it.\nI found this to be true across the entire audio range, from bass to treble. I've seen some Reddit reviews that complain these buds have weak bass. In reality, they have incredibly clear bass, whereas too many audio products simply blow out the bass beyond all reason.\nThese buds are so good they even compare favorably to over-ear headphones and luxury speakers.\nThe difference is obvious when switching back and forth between the AZ100s and other buds. Music just sounds more complete. They also produce incredible resonance, giving you a real sense of space.\nAnd if you like to crank up the volume to 11, these earbuds get loud. (Loud enough that sound leaks slightly to the people around you.)\nThese earbuds made me wonder how close we are to achieving peak earbuds. Beyond incremental improvements to battery life, noise cancellation, and comfort, where do we go from here?\nIntroducing the Magnetic Fluid Driver\nThe new Technics AZ100s use a proprietary Magnetic Fluid Driver to produce high-resolution, low-distortion sound that's as close to the original source as possible.\nWhat is a Magnetic Fluid Driver? Per Technics, the driver includes a ring of oily magnetic liquid between the driver magnet and voice coil (the part of the speaker that moves the diaphragm that produces sound waves). This creates more stable movement, higher clarity, and lower distortion. The new driver also uses an ultra-thin aluminum diaphragm for improved detail and sound separation.\nI got the chance to demo this tech at a Panasonic demonstration in Kyoto, Japan in Dec. 2024. Here's what the new driver looks like in action:\nThis Magnetic Fluid tech previously appeared in the Technics EAH-TZ70 in-ear monitors \u2014 professional monitors with a $1,199.99 price tag. The new AZ100s feature a miniaturized version of that tech, plus a much more reasonable $299.99 price tag, the same as Bose's flagship QuietComfort Ultra earbuds.\nI previously reviewed the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds for Mashable, and I've consistently rated them as the best wireless earbuds of the moment. So, how do they compare in a head-to-head test with the AZ100s?\nComparing the AZ100 to other headphones and earbuds\nI've reviewed a lot of audio products for Mashable and other publications. I was surprisingly impressed with the audio quality of the Dyson OnTrac over-ear headphones, and I've previously praised the Bose QuietComfort Ultra line.\nNow, premium over-ear headphones have advantages over wireless earbuds \u2014 a more comfortable form factor (and no ear wax gumming up the buds), a tighter seal around your ears, and larger speaker components. But unless you splurge on $1,000 in-ear monitors made for professionals, I don't know where you'll find better-sounding earbuds.\nThat said, I found the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds to be more comfortable for extended use. After three to four hours of wearing the AZ100s, I experienced some ear fatigue. The Bose buds are lighter and use a unique stability band that hugs the contour of your outer ear, and I find this provides a tighter seal and better fit. On the plus side, the AZ100 buds don't stick out too much from your ears, making them relatively comfortable when leaning against a pillow or surface.\nIn terms of active noise cancellation, the AZ100s are as good as the very best noise-cancelling earbuds I've tested. They filter out human voices extremely well. While testing, I couldn't hear my partner unlocking, opening, and closing a door just seven feet away from me, nor did I hear her yelling my name. They dampened the clamor of the New York City subway, too.\nAdditional features justify the high price point\nIf you have an Android smartphone or compatible digital audio player, the AZ100 buds support the LDAC codec, aka lossless audio. Now, I'm just a lowly iPhone and Spotify user, but if you're a true connoisseur of sound, you'll appreciate this.\nThe AZ100s also support multi-point connection on three Bluetooth devices at once. In my experience, lots of brands claim to offer multi-point connection, but in reality, you have to do a lot of annoying manual switching. Here, multipoint works seamlessly. As I write this, the buds are connected to my iPhone and Macbook, and I can switch back and forth to audio on either device.\nSurely, this will be the standard in the years ahead, and I can only hope other brands figure it out.\nThere are two other features I have to call out.\nFirst, the Voice Focus AI. These earbuds use AI to isolate the sound of human voices, which is helpful when listening on ambient mode. It's also very handy for phone calls and online meetings. Truly, it made other sounds disappear like magic on calls. You can activate it on either end of a call, or both.\nLastly, the adaptive aspect of the active noise cancellation is much appreciated. We haven't really seen custom tuning available for ANC since the Bose 700 noise-cancelling headphones disappeared. With the AZ100s, you can fine-tune the ANC to your liking, providing an even better audio experience.\nI haven't even mentioned the Dolby Atmos, the 10-hour battery life (with ANC engaged), or the IPX4 water resistance.\nIf you're curious, here are some of the tracks I used to test out these buds. I listened to these songs repeatedly with the Technics buds and other premium buds and headphones.\nThe verdict: Wow.\nPersonally, if I'm being asked to pay $300 or more for a product, I expect more than plastic. And in keeping with the premium tech inside these buds, the AZ100s use a metal charging case and metal accents on the buds themselves. The precision-cut details are a nice touch, especially compared to the all-plastic design of the competition.\nOf course, what really matters here is the sound quality. While Bose retains an edge on overall comfort, I'm not aware of any wireless earbuds in the world that offer better, fuller, more accurate sound.\nThe Technics Reference Class HiFi Wireless Earbuds are priced at $299.99 and are available now at Amazon, Crutchfield, and Panasonic.\nTopics Music Mashable Choice Gadgets"

      "text": "It\u2019s been a long eight years.\nSince the Nintendo Switch launched in early 2017, we\u2019ve collectively experienced the worst pandemic in a century. Presidents have come, gone, and come back again. In our personal lives, we've all experienced a tremendous amount of growth and change, whether we realize it or not. And through it all, we had the Switch, arguably the best Nintendo console ever made, and one of the best game consoles of all time.\nSo, how do you follow that up? It turns out the answer is \u201cmake it again, but better.\u201d The Nintendo Switch 2 launched on June 5, and it's already my new favorite Nintendo console, purely from a hardware perspective. The new console/handheld hybrid is a souped-up sequel with added horsepower to make games look and perform better than ever. But that\u2019s only part of what makes it great.\nPut simply, the Switch 2 is full of so many thoughtful little considerations that I\u2019ve frequently found myself amazed at how often it just works. For much of its recent history, Nintendo hardware has been an active impediment to enjoying Nintendo software because basic things like \u201cplaying video games on the internet with your friends\u201d were often maddeningly arcane. That\u2019s not the case anymore\u2026for the most part.\nWhile there are definitely quirks with the setup process, the new virtual game cards, and the $450 price tag (not counting games and peripherals), I\u2019m confident these problems will soften in time. I believe that eight years from now, we\u2019ll probably talk about the Switch 2 the same way we talk about its predecessor.\nUpdate: I've decided to come back and update this review after spending almost two months with the console. The short version: while there are a couple of problems that have reared their heads since my original review, I'm still loving the Switch 2. Crucially, the Switch 2 has also become easier to find in stock online.\nNintendo Switch 2 review: The basics\nTo start, I want to get something out of the way: I will not be analyzing the Switch 2\u2019s lineup of launch games in this hands-on review. The way I feel about the launch titles now will be irrelevant in a month or two. I will say that Mario Kart World is a ton of fun, but if that\u2019s not enough for you, you can wait a bit to get a Switch 2. That is all I will say on the matter.\nAnyway, in case you\u2019ve been living an ascetic off-the-grid existence for the last six months, the Switch 2 is a lot like the Switch 1. It\u2019s a handheld game console with detachable controllers that can be placed into a dock, which then outputs the image to a television. It\u2019s mostly compatible with Switch 1 games, and a decent number of them are actually better on Switch 2 thanks to paid upgrade packs, free patches, or, most surprisingly, the fact that the hardware inside the Switch 2 makes games better by itself, in some cases.\nIn other words, if you\u2019ve been a Switch devotee for the past several years, you can pick up right where you left off without even buying any new games. That\u2019s rad, but it\u2019s also just following the precedent set by the PS5 and Xbox Series X five years ago, so I don\u2019t want to give Nintendo too much praise for this. This is the bare minimum we should expect from new gaming consoles.\nBefore I get into discussing each granular part of Switch 2, I\u2019d like to say it feels great in the hands. I personally like that it\u2019s bigger than the first Switch, which eventually started to feel a bit like a child\u2019s toy after I got used to the Steam Deck. Nintendo made the vital decision to maintain the exact same level of thinness as the first Switch, so while it has a larger surface area, it\u2019s not anywhere near as bulky as handheld gaming PC alternatives. At 1.18 pounds, it\u2019s noticeably heavier than the first Switch, but I wouldn\u2019t call it burdensome to hold at all. It just feels more substantial, which I like.\nThe display looks good, but not OLED good\nFor some, the Switch never plugged into a TV at all. For others (like myself), it never left the dock. I largely fell out of love with handheld gaming as a teenager, as that was around the time TVs started to get really big and swanky. It didn\u2019t help that I lived in a place with no public transit at the time, either. There just wasn\u2019t much room for it in my life anymore. The Switch 2 display is changing that equation for me.\n1080p resolution\n120Hz refresh rate\nHDR support\nLCD panel\n7.9 inches\nFor comparison's sake, this display is about an inch bigger than the first Switch\u2019s LCD display, which also had no HDR support, topped out at 720p, and didn\u2019t go beyond 60Hz.\nYou may have noticed I didn\u2019t say \u201cOLED.\u201d This is likely going to be one of the first sources of disappointment for people, especially those with a Switch OLED or Steam Deck OLED. While the Switch 2\u2019s LCD is good, it definitely lacks the wider color range and more defined whites and blacks that an OLED offers. Games simply don\u2019t look as vibrant as they could on the Switch 2\u2019s display, especially if you frequently go between playing on a nice TV and playing in handheld mode.\nBrightness, too, is just OK. To be clear, the positives outweigh the negatives here; it\u2019s still a better display in terms of resolution and refresh rate than any Steam Deck model. Having a 120Hz panel is especially vital because it enables developers to include 40Hz performance modes in their games, which is a way to compromise between visual fidelity and smoothness in more demanding AAA blockbuster titles. Switch 2 games such as Cyberpunk 2077 make especially good use of this feature in handheld play.\nStill, I wouldn\u2019t blame anyone who wanted to wait for the inevitable OLED model in a year or two. Especially because, now that the system is out in the wild and in the hands of millions, lots of people have noted that the console's display simply isn't bright enough to offer a real HDR experience like it is supposed to.\nThe controllers are a big upgrade\nJust like the Switch 1, there are multiple control options with Switch 2.\nThe new Joy-Con 2 controllers attach and detach from the display using magnets, rather than a sliding rail mechanism, which is infinitely more satisfying. It\u2019s also more secure thanks to a clever release lever you have to pull to detach each Joy-Con. The previous console\u2019s Joy-Cons had a distinct little wiggle to them, even when attached, but the new ones feel locked in.\nAs I said in my day one Switch 2 review, attaching and detaching the new magnetic Joy-Con 2 controllers feels so good the first time you do it. Trust me.\nThe Switch 2 Joy Cons are also bigger, which is nice for people like me who have adult-sized hands. Admittedly, in handheld play, I still get a bit uncomfortable during long sessions. You don\u2019t get much of a grip on either side by default, so I specifically felt my right hand cramp up to a small extent while playing in bed. I\u2019ve heard other people complain about how the Joy-Cons feel when placed into the little grip accessory that turns them into more of a regular game controller, though I actually find that more comfortable than using them in handheld mode.\nMinor cramping issues aside (I was able to alleviate a good deal of it by just adjusting my bodily position), the buttons are more satisfying to press, and the new analog sticks are notably more responsive. They\u2019re very smooth in a way that\u2019s hard to articulate without just telling you to try them. We will have to wait and see if stick drift becomes an issue over time.\nLike a lot of people, I have always preferred the Pro Controller, and the new Switch 2 Pro Controller is\u2026basically the same as the first one. That\u2019s not a bad thing! It\u2019s a little more dense and heavy, presumably due to improved internal mechanisms, but that\u2019s fine. Buttons and analog sticks feel great across the board on the Pro Controller, and it brings back gyro controls for games that benefit from those, so you aren\u2019t missing out on anything by using it. I highly recommend picking one of these up, if you can.\nWell, with one caveat: The new Pro Controller is apparently a disaster for self-repair aficionados. The repair experts at iFixit said as much in a scathing teardown video made a few weeks after launch; the short version is that it's an $85 controller that's almost guaranteed to break after enough use, and the best recourse at that point will just be to buy another one because you can't easily repair it yourself.\nGoing back to my earlier point about how much of the Switch 2 \u201cjust works,\u201d this can first be seen with controllers. You can actually pair your Switch 1 Joy-Cons or Pro Controllers with a Switch 2. According to Reddit, you can even use a Switch 1 Joy-Con and a Switch 2 Joy-Con together as a pair. You don\u2019t really have to jump through any weird hoops to make any of this happen, either. I went to a friend\u2019s place for a Mario Kart night, and using a Switch 1 Pro Controller worked seamlessly. It\u2019s great that your old accessories aren\u2019t immediately useless on the new console.\nThe dock\nThere isn\u2019t a ton to say about the Switch 2\u2019s dock because, like before, it\u2019s meant to sit underneath or next to a TV, where ideally you\u2019ll barely ever think about it. It\u2019s more bulky than its predecessor thanks to some additional processing power and more fans inside of it, but it\u2019s still smaller than your average game console by a wide margin.\nUnlike the original Switch dock (and like the Switch OLED dock), there\u2019s an included Ethernet port now. Hell yes. I wired it up to my router right away and would have liked to have kept it that way forever. Unfortunately, just a few weeks after launch, my Switch 2's Ethernet port mysteriously stopped working. This has happened to some other people online, so it's not just a fluke on my end.\nThe software\nFrom a system-level software standpoint, the Switch 2 is a lot like the Switch 1. The main menu looks more or less identical, save for some new icons on the bottom row. There are still only two themes, a light one and a dark one. Aside from a couple of amusing little sound effects here and there, it\u2019s very sterile and lacks the pizzazz of previous Nintendo console operating systems.\nThere\u2019s definitely a part of me that resents this. The UI is quick and snappy, yes, but it\u2019s possible to marry efficiency of use with fun aesthetics. Even some fun themes would help a lot, but alas, they aren\u2019t here.\nI don\u2019t want to paper over the \u201cquick and snappy\u201d part, though, especially as it relates to the new eShop. Nintendo\u2019s digital storefronts have been nightmarishly sluggish to use for basically as long as they\u2019ve existed, across various DS consoles, the Wii, the Wii U, and the first Switch. The new eShop isn\u2019t flashy (or even very different at all) in appearance, but my God, does it work so much better than before. You can get in, purchase a game, and get out in less than a minute. Praise be.\nThe social features: GameChat is a godsend\nRevisiting the theme of Switch 2\u2019s thoughtfulness and elegance, let\u2019s talk about its online features.\nYes, I can imagine you\u2019re a little shocked to see the words \u201cthoughtfulness\u201d and \u201celegance\u201d anywhere near \u201conline features\u201d as they relate to a Nintendo console. But nothing surprised me more about the Switch 2 than GameChat. This is a voice and video chat feature you can activate by pressing the \u201cC\u201d button, the only new button on every Switch 2 controller. Doing so prompts you to either start a room or join an existing one being hosted by one of your friends, and up to 12 people can be in a GameChat room at once.\nOf course, this is similar to what has been on offer on Xbox and PlayStation consoles for nearly two decades. Nintendo didn\u2019t reinvent the wheel here. What it did do, however, is create a voice chat service that moves beyond pure utility and into the realm of actively being enjoyable to use. Nintendo achieved this by placing a big priority on open-room microphone use, and everything that makes GameChat great starts from there.\nThere\u2019s a mic built into the Switch 2 itself that is simply remarkable at picking up human voices and filtering out everything else. It feels like magic, especially considering a docked Switch\u2019s microphone is usually closer to your TV speaker. I tested GameChat while sitting next to a loud window air conditioner unit, and the people on the other end swear they couldn't hear it. Likewise, I\u2019ve never heard anything other than their voices, either.\nThis also opens up more possibilities for group play, as several people can physically be in a room together and talk into the same microphone. That\u2019s the kind of thing that headset-centric voice chat can't do.\nThat said, you can also plug a headset into your Pro Controller\u2019s new headphone jack, too. One of the most \u201coh my god I can\u2019t believe that worked\u201d moments for me was when I connected the official wireless PlayStation headset to my Switch 2, and it worked natively, with the console even correctly labeling it as a PlayStation headset. I wasn\u2019t shocked that the audio would output to the headset (you can also do that on a Switch 1, funnily enough), but the fact that the microphone worked without any fuss whatsoever felt miraculous to me.\nAnd if you're a parent who's worried about young children playing GameChat, check out the new parental controls for the Switch 2.\nGameChat makes social livestreaming possible\nUnbelievably, there\u2019s way more to GameChat than merely talking to people. Up to four people in one GameChat session can actually stream their gameplay feed to everyone else, and those feeds are arranged horizontally in a row along the bottom of the screen. You can blow up someone\u2019s feed to full-screen to watch them play or turn off any individual user\u2019s feed if it\u2019s distracting to you.\nYes, of course, the feed is very choppy, running at what I estimate to be about 10 frames per second. However, the picture is clear enough to see what\u2019s going on, at least. You don\u2019t want to stare at one of these streams for very long, but it\u2019s actually pretty handy (and more importantly, fun) to be able to see what your friends are doing. It even works across games. Over the weekend, my friend sold me on an indie game called Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo using game streaming, while I simultaneously showed them Vectorman for the Sega Genesis. We wound up spending about half an hour chatting about whatever while occasionally checking in on each other\u2019s feeds, and it felt like I was in a Nintendo commercial.\nGameChat offers webcam support\nFor my Switch 2 review, I tested out webcam support using the official Nintendo camera. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t want to spend $54.99 on that, though, because it sounds like basically any old USB-C camera will work. By default, the camera will try to cut out your face/body from the background of your little GameChat window, though it had a hard time doing that cleanly in my limited testing. To be honest, I don\u2019t see myself using this very much, but it\u2019s nice that it\u2019s there, especially for folks who use online gaming as a way to spend time with loved ones whose faces they don\u2019t get to see that often.\nBeyond that, GameChat has a fairly incredible speech-to-text window that's astoundingly fast and accurate. It even labels individual speakers! My favorite part is that it doesn\u2019t censor curse words, either. Amusingly, it also properly capitalizes many brand names, even those from competing game publishers like \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d and \u201cSega Dreamcast.\u201d\nAnd that still isn\u2019t everything! There\u2019s a new feature called GameShare that you can use to, well, share a game digitally with friends who are in a GameChat session with you. I tested this out with a rather fun futuristic racing game called Fast Fusion. All I had to do was create a room, send an invite to my friend, and they were almost instantly playing with me. Remarkably, they didn\u2019t have to download anything beforehand. I\u2019m guessing this is using some newfangled streaming tech because my friend noted that their feed was a little blurry. That said, the frame rate was apparently smooth and the game was perfectly responsive. It should be noted that it\u2019s up to developers to support GameShare, and you can\u2019t just do it with any game. However, I can at least confirm that it works amazingly well where it\u2019s supported.\nI don\u2019t want to say something I can\u2019t take back like \u201cNintendo has finally figured out the internet,\u201d but\u2026maybe Nintendo has finally figured out the internet? I will say this: I love GameChat.\nThe hidden costs and headaches\nI\u2019ve been effusively praising the Switch 2 for most of this review, but because this is still a Nintendo console at the end of the day, there are a handful of very irritating things about it.\nMost unexpected of all is pricing. I maintain that $450 for the console, while not inexpensive, is reasonable given its technical specs. It\u2019s the accessories and other accoutrements that get out of control, partially due to President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, according to Nintendo.\nThe camera is $54.99. A pair of new Joy-Cons is $94.99. A Pro Controller is $84.99. And Mario Kart World, the console\u2019s lone flagship launch title, is $79.99, which really stings, even if someone was going to do that eventually. There are plenty of reasons why video game prices have gotten so high, but all the context in the world doesn\u2019t matter when that charge hits your bank account.\nSwitch 2\u2019s internal storage capacity of 256GB is also problematic because the only way to expand the storage is to buy a microSD Express card. That\u2019s a relatively new kind of external storage that most regular people probably don\u2019t know about and isn\u2019t always super clearly labeled when you go to buy a microSD card. For context, microSD Express has substantially faster data read speeds than the regular microSD card you used in your Switch 1, which I feel the need to emphasize will not work in your Switch 2.\nIf Nintendo allowed the use of normal microSD cards, the Switch 2 would be a less capable machine. Unfortunately, given that we\u2019re probably at least a year or two away from microSD Express cards being more affordable, we\u2019re in this awkward period where the Switch 2 is future-proofed, but not necessarily present-proofed. It doesn\u2019t help that a few launch games, namely Cyberpunk 2077 and Hitman approach 60GB install sizes.\nSpeaking of digital game installs, Nintendo has introduced a new \u201cvirtual game card\u201d system for tying digital purchases to a user\u2019s account. If you download a game from the store, it gets \u201cloaded\u201d onto your console, where it will live exclusively until you delete it, load it onto a different Switch console, or virtually loan it to a friend for up to two weeks. Just so I\u2019m being perfectly clear: If you loan a virtual game card to someone, you can\u2019t play that game you bought until it\u2019s returned to you.\nFor childless people like me, this is an arcane nuisance that\u2019s easy enough to overlook. For anyone who lives in a multi-Switch household (and there are a lot of those), this could be a logistical nightmare for competitive siblings. I shudder to think about the inevitable fights over who gets to have the Mario Kart virtual game card for the next two weeks. Godspeed, parents.\nThe last (and to be honest, least) of these problems regards the initial setup process for Switch 2. Most of it is standard stuff: connect to WiFi, log into your account, set the time zone, etc. On top of that, you\u2019ll also be given the opportunity to transfer data from a Switch 1 to your new Switch 2, which, again, is normal and fine. What\u2019s not normal and fine is that apparently you only get one shot to do this, so if you say no out of expediency, that\u2019s it.\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons and Pok\u00e9mon: Scarlet and Violet players need to take note of this because those are two of the only major Switch 1 games that don\u2019t allow for the use of cloud saves. If you don\u2019t transfer your save data from a Switch 1, you will have to start over. I really hope Nintendo fixes this and allows for post-setup data transfers soon.\nThe Switch 2 battery life\nOh yeah, the Switch 2 is a handheld console, so battery life is worth examining. Nintendo rates the console's battery life at two to 6.5 hours. In all my testing, I haven\u2019t been able to get more than three or so hours out of a full charge. We knew ahead of time that it would have a worse battery life than Switch 1, so this isn\u2019t some huge rug-pull or anything.\nYour mileage may vary depending on the games you play. An old Switch 1 game that doesn\u2019t make use of any advanced Switch 2 hardware features will probably get more juice out of a full charge than Cyberpunk 2077, which just annihilates the battery in an almost impressive fashion. It definitely sucks for a product to have a worse battery life than its predecessor, but in fairness, it\u2019s not very different from any other modern gaming handheld. They\u2019ve all sacrificed longevity for power.\nThe verdict: I can't stop playing my Switch 2\nI\u2019m going to keep this short because I just spent more than 3,500 words explaining my thoughts: The Nintendo Switch 2 is great. This is a fabulous console/handheld hybrid with hugely improved system software, much beefier horsepower for playing games, and a more premium form factor that doesn\u2019t succumb to the same bulk as its handheld PC counterparts.\nSure, the Switch 2 isn\u2019t without some hangups. Pricing will continue to be a topic of conversation. I\u2019m also nervous about future price hikes, in light of Xbox recently doing that in the middle of a console generation. The virtual game card system also feels like it will create more problems than it solves, and Switch 2 owners are going to have to get stingy with storage space until microSD Express cards become cheaper.\nBut all of that is lessened in my mind because I know Nintendo\u2019s first-party games for the new Switch console will largely be excellent, and its capacity for third-party support is greatly expanded. Switch 2\u2019s online social features could also be legitimately game-changing for Nintendo, a company that is finally willing to acknowledge that not everyone can or wants to play multiplayer games locally.\nAt any rate, I think the next seven or eight years of Nintendo will be just fine.\nUpdated on July 26: Our original Nintendo Switch 2 review was published on June 13. We've since updated the review after spending more time with the console.\nTopics Nintendo Nintendo Switch Video Games"

      "text": "Table of Contents\nMy cooler is cooler than most coolers. My cooler is also a boombox.\nMy cooler is the $149.99 Igloo KoolTunes Playmate Cooler, a 14-quart hardsider with built-in speakers. It's a 2020s reboot of an identical cooler-boombox combo Igloo released back in 1989, complete with the same retro look, but now with wireless Bluetooth connectivity.\nMy first brush with the KoolTunes was back in 2023, when I was trawling Best Buy's listings in search of pink gadgets for a Barbiecore gift guide. Ever since then, I've wondered why I've never seen one in real life: It combines two summer entertaining essentials in one cute, convenient package; it feels like a no-brainer for beach days and tailgates. Is it merely the victim of poor marketing, or is it actually a shoddy gimmick that sucks to use?\nAfter finally testing the KoolTunes during a recent lakeside picnic, I have to believe it's the former. The KoolTunes keeps snacks and beverages cold while offering well-rounded sound quality (minus some oomphy bass). It's a fun, functional novelty product that I enjoy using so much, I think it deserves a Mashable Choice Award. Spread the word.\nIgloo KoolTunes review: Design and features\nThe KoolTunes is a variant of Igloo's classic plastic Playmate design that comes in vaporwave colorways. It has a built-in handle and a tent-top lid that swivels open when you press a button on its side. It can easily fit a 12-pack of beer or soda cans with a standard seven-pound bag of ice. It's IP56-rated for protection against dust particles and big splashes, so it's safe to use outdoors \u2014 just don't dunk it in water.\nFor my picnic, I stocked the KoolTunes with a charcuterie spread for my husband and me (plus drinks) on ice. We spent two hours with it outside in humid 80-degree Fahrenheit weather, then brought it back home. After unpacking our leftovers, I set the KoolTunes out on the counter, still full of solid ice, so I could see how fast its contents melted. Lo and behold, a bunch of ice chunks were still floating around in there at the 24-hour mark. They'd certainly disappear faster had I left the KoolTunes out in the sun all day, but I'm confident that it can keep refreshments chilled for at least a full afternoon in the heat.\nThere are two saucer-sized 5W speakers on the front of the KoolTunes. On the back, you'll find a control panel with physical buttons for power, Bluetooth pairing, and volume; a USB-C port for charging (hidden under a rubbery flap); and an indicator light. The light turns blue when the KoolTunes is connected to your smartphone, green when it's fully charged, and red while it's charging. It flashes blue when the KoolTunes is in pairing mode and red when it's low on battery. (Note: I haven't tested the KoolTunes' battery life yet, but Igloo rates it at up to 10 hours per charge. I'll update this review once I've verified that.)\nThe KoolTunes comes with a three-foot USB-C charging cord, but you'll have to supply your own USB adapter.\nThe KoolTunes connects to your smartphone using Bluetooth 5.0. That's really outdated wireless technology \u2014 it came out in 2016; in 2025, we're on Bluetooth 6.1 \u2014 but I don't think most users will care. (I mean, the latest Apple iPhone still uses Bluetooth 5.3 from 2021.) The KoolTunes paired almost instantly with my iPhone 15 Pro at startup and remembered the phone the next time I turned it on; I didn't need to re-pair them. Also, I was able to walk the length of three Chicago city lots without losing its connection, meaning it has a wireless range of at least 100 feet.\nThe KoolTunes supports a \"KoolSync\" feature that lets you share its audio with a second KoolTunes. (It's only compatible with its ilk, not any other portable speakers.) Igloo accidentally sent me two review units, so I was able to try it this mode myself. It's nothing miraculous, but it works as intended. If you happen to attend the same cookout or pool party as another KoolTunes owner, you can DIY a stereo system.\nIgloo KoolTunes review: Sound quality\nTruthfully, I really only expected the KoolTunes to be good at the \"cooler\" half of its job description since Igloo isn't in the audio business. But as it turns out, it's actually a half-decent portable speaker, too.\nMaybe it's because I spend most of my days testing laptops, which generally sound \u2014 if I may be frank \u2014 like ass. But I really do think the KoolTunes' audio is pleasantly clear and crisp, not tinny or muffled. Music playing from it sounded balanced, while voices on podcasts were undistorted.\nI'll add three caveats. One is that the KoolTunes\u2019 sound is mainly front-facing, since that's where its speakers are located. You won't hear what it's playing as well if you're behind or beside it.\nThe second is that the KoolTunes' audio has a teeny bit of bass to it, but none of the deep, thumping bass you'd get from a nicer portable speaker. (My $179.95 JBL Charge 5, an older version of our top pick, blows it out of the water here.) Igloo describes it as being \"punchy\"; on a scale from 1 to Rocky Balboa, I'd give it a solid 2.\nMy final asterisk is that the KoolTunes can sound strained at higher volumes, depending on what's playing. \"365\" by Charli xcx was fine at full blast, but \"Sundown\" by Gordon Lightfoot seemed forced. It wasn't crackling or muddy-sounding, but it sort of felt like it was pushing the KoolTunes to its limit. That said, you'll probably never use the KoolTunes at max volume in public places or at social functions where you'll be chatting with others: It can get really loud.\nIgloo KoolTunes review: Price and overall value\nThe KoolTunes retails for $149.99 on the Igloo website and at major retailers like Amazon and Dick's Sporting Goods. (It was sold out at Best Buy, Costco, and Walmart the last time I checked.) Igloo itself carries the most color options, including special-edition designs inspired by bands and NFL teams. Those go for $40 more if you can catch them in stock.\nThe KoolTunes would be excessively expensive if it were just a plain old cooler sans speaker functionality. Igloo sells a rugged 14-quart Playmate for $32.99 and a standard 16-quart Playmate for $29.99. Does the boombox bit merit a $120 upcharge? After speaking with Mashable's Bethany Allard, who's tested Bluetooth speakers in the past, I think it's mostly valid.\nAccording to Allard, speakers around the $100 mark typically ditch great bass and a long battery life to remain affordable. They also lack good audio quality and clarity at higher volume, she said. In this sense, the KoolTunes parallels the competition at its price point.\nAllard added that most Bluetooth speakers retailing for $100 to $120 usually have some sort of companion app that lets the user toggle equalizer settings, check on their battery life, and play around with different connection options. This is the KoolTunes' biggest shortcoming compared to regular budget speakers. (Igloo doesn't have an app for it.) I personally didn't notice its absence when I was using my KoolTunes, but if you're someone who likes being able to adjust and customize their speakers' sound, you'll miss out on some extra fixings here.\nIf it helps, the KoolTunes is relatively easy to find on sale at a deep discount. The Igloo website had it marked down to $99.99 in mid-July during Amazon's Prime Day sale, and I expect similar deals to pop up over Labor Day weekend and Black Friday. If you're a Costco member, I'd keep an especially close eye out for it there: It dipped down to just $49.97 on the wholesale retailer's website before selling out.\nThe cooler portion of the KoolTunes comes with a one-year warranty, but its electrical components (i.e., the speaker parts) are only covered for 90 days. That's a really short warranty, so be sure to inspect your KoolTunes for any manufacturing defects as soon as you unbox it. For comparison's sake, regular portable speakers from popular brands like JBL and Bose have one-year warranties. The Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4, Mashable's favorite budget Bluetooth speaker, has a two-year warranty.\nFinal thoughts: Is the Igloo KoolTunes worth it?\nThe KoolTunes is one of my favorite products I've tested all year. It's not a gimmick, but a fun fusion of summer party gear that's priced mostly fairly. All the better if you can find it on sale.\nI wouldn't buy a KoolTunes to replace a good portable speaker that you already like and use, but if you want to upgrade an existing cooler to something with a little more pizazz, I think it's a rad option. It would also make a great gift for outdoorsy folks in your life. They probably don't have one yet, for some odd reason.\nTopics Mashable Choice Outdoors"

YOU MUST CLICK ON THE PROMOTION LINK FOR THE REWARDS OFFER DURING THE SAME SHOPPING SESSION THAT YOU COMPLETE YOUR PURCHASE FROM THE MERCHANT. THE PURCHASE MUST BE MADE IN US DOLLARS. IF YOU VISIT OTHER SITES BEFORE COMPLETING YOUR PURCHASE, OR IF YOU USE COUPON CODES NOT PROVIDED BY RETAILMENOT, YOUR PURCHASE MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH A SERVICE OTHER THAN RETAILMENOT AND YOU MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE REWARD(S). YOU MUST NOT ENABLE AN AD BLOCKER OR OTHERWISE DISABLE COOKIES ON YOUR COMPUTER, BECAUSE COOKIES ARE USED TO AUTHENTICATE YOUR PURCHASE. RetailMeNot In-Store Cash Back Rewards.

RetailMeNot Receipt Scanning. You agree to at all times provide accurate and complete information to RetailMeNot. You agree not to: submit a Receipt that is false, inaccurate, fabricated, counterfeited, incomplete, tampered with, adjusted, or otherwise inauthentic for the purpose of seeking to claim a Reward; redeem, or attempt to redeem, a Reward for products that have not actually been purchased, or for products that have been returned; submit or attempt to submit a Receipt that has already been submitted or used by you or another user; or submit Receipts outside of a Promotion Period, or for a purchase that took place prior to or after the launch date of a Rewards O\ufb00er. RetailMeNot may, in its sole discretion, extend or shorten the redemption period for a Rewards O\ufb00er. As between you and RetailMeNot, the determination as to what transactions are Qualifying Transactions shall be made by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Bonus Rewards. From time to time, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er a Bonus Reward to certain RetailMeNot members who complete a qualifying activity or who meet certain criteria, as de\ufb01ned in a Rewards O\ufb00er Card or Promotion Landing Page, in addition to or in combination with o\ufb00ers for Online Cash Back Rewards or In-Store Cash Back Rewards. For example, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er certain Bonus Rewards to new members who earn an Online Cash Back Reward for the \ufb01rst time or earn certain Online Cash Back Rewards for the \ufb01rst time. In order to earn a Bonus Reward, you must satisfy all criteria set forth for earning the Bonus Reward as well as the requirements of these Promotion Terms during the promotion period for the Bonus Reward. RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust the promotion period and/or the bonus amount for Bonus Reward, at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Bonus Rewards are a limited time o\ufb00er and all criteria must be satis\ufb01ed within the dates of the Promotion. Returns, Approvals, and No Ownership. For any Rewards O\ufb00er, if you return or exchange the items purchased, complete your purchase before or after the Promotion Period, initiate a purchase that results in a chargeback, or fail to satisfy a Minimum Purchase Amount, or any other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card, RetailMeNot reserves the right to invalidate or withdraw all or part of the Rewards O\ufb00er, or reclaim Reward earnings. The determination of whether or not a purchase quali\ufb01es for the Rewards O\ufb00er and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed is at the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. In the event of a dispute, you may be required to provide your order con\ufb01rmation as proof of purchase. Order confirmations must be provided within six (6) months from the purchase date to qualify for this review. The timing of when RetailMeNot will issue an Approved Reward will vary based on a number of factors. These factors may include the type of Promotion pursuant to which a Reward is o\ufb00ered and your account activity as a member of RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the order and timing in which to process its con\ufb01rmation of eligible purchases. Rewards may be limited where participation exceeds the Total Rewards O\ufb00ers available during Promotion or in other cases, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. RetailMeNot also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reevaluate Approved Rewards, at any time, without notice, including, but not limited to, whether purchases qualify for the Promotion and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed, and RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust or withdraw any Rewards O\ufb00ers or any Approved Rewards (or reclaim Reward earnings), at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Participating in a Rewards O\ufb00er does not give you ownership or any other legal claim to any Reward unless and until RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, determines that you have met all eligibility criteria and ful\ufb01lled all requirements for the Promotion and you have completed the Redemption Process. Rewards O\ufb00ers are provided solely by RetailMeNot and are not underwritten or funded by any other third party. You may not make any claims for Rewards O\ufb00ers against Merchants or any other third party. Notwithstanding that Rewards O\ufb00ers may include o\ufb00ers of cash, prior to redemption, Rewards O\ufb00ers and Approved Rewards have no monetary value and you may not obtain any money or any other thing of value for any Approved Reward or participation in any Rewards O\ufb00er unless and until you complete the Redemption Process and a payment has been issued by RetailMeNot for Approved Rewards. Wallet and Redeeming Rewards. Approved Rewards will be shown in the RetailMeNot Rewards Wallet. You have no vested rights in Approved Rewards unless and until you complete the Redemption Process. If your RetailMeNot account is terminated by RetailMeNot, as provided in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, or if you elect to close your RetailMeNot account, you will no longer be permitted to access the Rewards Wallet or redeem Approved Rewards shown therein. You may redeem Approved Rewards for cash using PayPal or Venmo. Redeeming for cash to Paypal or Venmo. In order to redeem Approved Rewards for cash via PayPal or Venmo, you must: (1) have or create a PayPal or Venmo Account that is linked to the phone number or email address, where applicable, that RetailMeNot has on \ufb01le for you; (2) navigate to the \u201cMy Rewards\u201d section of your account, click \u201cRedeem Rewards\u201d, and then click either \u201cPaypal\u201d or \u201cVenmo\u201d, as applicable; and (3) perform any actions speci\ufb01ed in the RetailMeNot app or website, as modi\ufb01ed from time to time in the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. For example, such actions may include, but are not limited to, authenticating your account by providing a US based cell phone number with SMS capabilities, re-entering a password, and clicking the appropriate link or button. Once you have completed the required steps to redeem Approved Rewards, RetailMeNot will issue a payment to the PayPal or Venmo Account, as applicable, that is linked to the email address, or phone number, as applicable, that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account. An email or text message, where applicable, will be sent to that email address or phone number, where applicable, con\ufb01rming that the payment has been issued. Generally, redemption of an Approved Reward will result in the issuing of payment within minutes, but in some cases may require a longer time period. RetailMeNot is not responsible for lost or stolen payments or for delivery of payments to the wrong PayPal or Venmo account. If an account has not been credited with a Qualifying Transaction in the previous 12 months, it may be deemed an Inactive Cash Back Account. Accounts which meet this criteria will be debited a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of the lesser of $2.00 or the current account balance. Maintenance fees will not draw the account balance below $0.00. Maintenance fees will be assessed until the account balance reaches $0.00 or the account becomes an active cash back user again. Forced Redemptions. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with any limitations or requirements speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot from time to time, including, but not limited to, requirements not to redeem Approved Rewards that exceed amounts speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to cause the redemption of Approved Rewards, in whole or in part, and issue payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, but RetailMeNot undertakes no obligation to do so under any circumstances. You hereby authorize RetailMeNot to perform any such redemptions and issue any such payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, automatically and without further action by you. Abuse and Cancellations. RetailMeNot reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a user\u2019s account, entire Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you, including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures, limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning of the Promotion, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Without limiting anything in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of any individual it \ufb01nds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion, or in behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, RetailMeNot reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. RetailMeNot shall not be liable to you for any suspension, modi\ufb01cation or termination of a Rewards O\ufb00er, Approved Rewards, or the Promotion program. Use of any automated means or more than one account is prohibited and will result in disquali\ufb01cation. In the event of any dispute as to the quali\ufb01cation of potential recipients of a Reward, the authorized account holder of the email address or phone number provided to RetailMeNot at the time the account was created will be deemed the quali\ufb01ed Reward recipient. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Each potential recipient of Rewards may be required to show proof of being an authorized account holder. If your account remains inactive for 24 months, RetailMeNot reserves the right to permanently close the Account at which time the cash back rewards will be considered expired and will no longer be eligible for redemption. Before closing the Account, RetailMeNot will attempt to alert you to the fact that your account may be shut down due to inactivity. Premium Services: Certain Services provided by Ziff Davis require registration and payment (such Services are referred to collectively as the \u201cPremium Services\u201d). You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis\u2019 third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below. If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. For CNET Cash Back and Rewards Services Acceptance of terms. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms and conditions, and that you agree to be legally bound by all of them. You also acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to review and agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, you may not participate in or use the Services. Eligibility. You represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under age eighteen (18), you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. Rewards. The Services enable you to access and earn rewards, subject to the guidelines herein (\u201cServices\u201d). CNET offers users opportunities to earn cash back on their purchases from Merchants activated by the creation of trackable links (\u201cLinks\u201d) for a Merchant as a way to incentivize the purchase and promotion of the Merchant\u2019s products. Links are configured to track and attribute transactions to you so that you may earn a reward if you or someone to whom you send a Link completes a qualifying transaction with a Merchant. The CNET cashback program is an incentive and promotional program. Some transactions may not earn rewards or may earn at a rate different from the rate indicated by the Service. You are not guaranteed to earn a reward from a transaction for several reasons, without notice to you, including, without limitation: Merchants may alter terms, conditions, or commission rates. Merchants may discontinue their programs. Merchants may exclude certain products from Reward eligibility. Merchants may have technical failures which result in transactions failing to be tracked or attributed to you. Links may fail to function properly. Links may be disabled by web browsers or ad blockers. Merchants may reject transactions due to suspected policy violations. Other: charge-backs, product returns, accounting error, Merchant non-payment, fraudulent transactions, our inability to contact you to validate transactions, your inappropriate distribution of Links, or your failure to comply with Merchant policies. If the Merchant pays less than the expected amount or does not pay a commission for the transaction, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to adjust or cancel the reward. Furthermore, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to withhold, cancel or adjust the amount of any reward, for any reason at any time. By using the Services, you accept this condition. CNET may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any person, including any affiliate, without your consent. Payout timing. We only provide a reward to you after a transaction is successfully tracked and completed, after we receive payment for that specific transaction from the Merchant, and after you accrue the Minimum Redemption Amount (as defined below). Merchants usually have holdback periods during which they hold a pending payment (for example, until the expiration of a return policy and/or until a service is consumed). Rewards remain in a pending state until we receive payment from the Merchant for the associated transaction. After we receive payment and you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, you may request to redeem your rewards. Payout Threshold. A minimum approved balance of $10.00 is required for redemption (the \u201cMinimum Redemption Amount\u201d). This amount may change from time to time, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. If your balance is below the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards will be stored in a record on your account and may be subject to a Dormant Account Fee (as defined below). Once you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards may be redeemed for third-party merchant gift cards. Use of a third-party merchant gift card at a selected merchant will be subject to such merchant\u2019s and/or the gift card issuer\u2019s own terms of service. Coupons. Some rewards may include coupons, discounts or promotions from Merchants (\u201cOffers\u201d). We do not guarantee that Merchants will honor Offers. Offer codes may be expired or invalid. Offers may not be eligible for your transaction, based upon exclusions, terms and conditions determined by Merchants. Offers are not redeemable for any value with CNET. Dormant accounts. If you have pending rewards and your account has no new activity (defined as the earning of a pending reward) for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, we reserve the right to assess a monthly Dormant Account Fee of up to $5.00 USD, until such time as your reward balance reaches $0.00, to recover the cost associated with maintenance of the account. Any Dormant Account Fee we apply may or may not be displayed in your user dashboard. If your account has no new activity for a period of twelve (12) months, we reserve the right to void any remaining balance of rewards in your account. Tax. You are solely responsible for independently assessing and complying with all relevant tax and legal requirements. We shall not provide you with tax or legal advice. Cookies. Some Merchants may place cookies (or other tracking beacons) on your device to recognize your device during a subsequent visit. If you, or those clicking on your shared Link, block or delete cookies, tracking and attribution may be inoperable, in which case no reward shall be earned. Third-Party Services. We do not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products, services or content of Merchants or other third parties. We are not an agent, broker or otherwise responsible for any Merchant\u2019s activities, policies, products or services.

International Use We make no claims that any Material, Services or any Content is appropriate or may be downloaded outside of the United States or outside the country where such Material, Services or any Content was produced. Access to the Material, Services or any Content may not be legal in certain countries or for certain persons. If you access any Material, Services or Content from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction. You agree to comply with: (i) all local rules regarding user conduct on the Internet and acceptable content; and (ii) all applicable laws regarding the downloading and/or transmission of technical data and other material from or to the United States and the country in which you are located. 13.

Please do not send us any such ideas or materials relating to such ideas. This is to avoid any potential misunderstanding or dispute should our products or marketing strategies seem similar to unsolicited ideas submitted to us. If, despite this request, you do send us any unsolicited ideas or materials, we make no assurances that such ideas or materials will be treated as confidential or proprietary. 14. Binding Arbitration In the unlikely event that you\u2019re not satisfied with customer service\u2019s solution, and you and Ziff Davis are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (1) Claims Subject to Arbitration: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ziff Davis and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a current member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. References to \u201cZiff Davis,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including Ziff Davis, Inc., Ziff Davis, LLC, Everyday Health, Inc., Everyday Health Media, LLC, and their affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. (2) Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Ziff Davis must be emailed to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). Any Notice must include (i) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute. After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). If you are unable to participate in the settlement conference by video, you may attend telephonically upon showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances warranting telephonic participation (e.g., inability to afford equipment or sufficient Wi-Fi due to indigent circumstances). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules). Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(2). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and Ziff Davis have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration. (3) Arbitration Procedure: The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a75.) The NAM Rules are available online at www.namadr.com or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. We and you agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Section 13(2) and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address and you and a Ziff Davis representative will be required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding only between you and Ziff Davis and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court. As in court, you and Ziff Davis agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriately represented parties and counsel. Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (b)). (4) Arbitration Fees: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees. (5) Confidentiality: Upon either party\u2019s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law. (6) Offer of Settlement: In any arbitration between you and Ziff Davis, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party\u2019s favor and is less than the defending party\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party\u2019s favor, the other party must pay the defending party\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing. (7) Requirement of Individualized Relief: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and Ziff Davis will be subject to this Section 13 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 13 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement. (8) Opt Out of Future Changes: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if Ziff Davis makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending Ziff Davis an email to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; (v) the relevant Site; and (vi) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether. (9) Mass Filing: If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 13(2), until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge. Stage Four: If your claim is not resolved at this time, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. You and Ziff Davis agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Ziff Davis acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.(10) Severability: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein. 15. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER You and Ziff Davis agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and Ziff Davis may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and Ziff Davis may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Ziff Davis may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Ziff Davis waive any right to a jury trial. 16. Limitation Period for Claims You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. 17. Miscellaneous We may be required by international, state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Ziff Davis each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, the Borough of Manhattan (the \u201cCourts\u201d) with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding (whether based on forum non conveniens or otherwise); additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances. Ziff Davis\u2019 failure to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by Ziff Davis, and such waiver shall not be construed as Ziff Davis\u2019 waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 18. New Jersey Residents If, and to the extent that New Jersey law applies, with respect to residents of New Jersey, the terms in Sections 6 (insofar as any claims may arise from, or relate to, consumer protection or fraud and/or misrepresentation, or result in attorney\u2019s fees), 9 and 14 do not limit any rights you may have as a consumer under New Jersey law and are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the state of your residence. Subject to the foregoing, Ziff Davis, third party content providers, and their respective agents reserve all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under New Jersey law. Nothing in this Section shall modify the binding arbitration clause and waiver for class action and jury trial in Section 13. 19. Australia Residents Nothing in these Terms (including in Sections 6, 9 and 15) limits, excludes or modifies any rights you may have under any law, including under the Australian Consumer Law (the \u201cACL\u201d) and consumer guarantees under the ACL, which may not be limited, excluded or modified by agreement (including where such exclusion, restriction or modification would be illegal or void under such law). 20. Privacy Policy The applicable privacy policy will be made available on the property from which you accessed these Terms. Such privacy policy is incorporated by reference into these Terms.

      "text": "Table of Contents\nOn May 15, Sony launched its latest flagship product, the noise-cancelling WH-1000XM6 headphones. It's been three long years since the previous-generation XM5 headphones were released, and there is one major design change: The headphones now fold up for easy portability.\nOtherwise, I'd class the changes as more iterative than innovative, but if you want best-in-class noise-cancellling headphones and pristine audio quality, the headphones deliver \u2014 with a catch. The new Sony XM6 headphones are about $50 more expensive than the XM5s.\nThe most likely explanation for the price increase? Tariffs, of course. There's been a rash of tech price hikes lately, but let's not go there.\nSo, how do the new Sony headphones sound? I've been testing the headphones ahead of their official launch, and I believe they (mostly) justify their $449.99 price tag. We'll be updating this review as we spend more time with these wireless headphones, but let's dive into my first-hand impressions.\nYou can also watch my Sony XM6 headphones review in video form, if you prefer:\nSony WH-1000XM6 Headphones review: How do they sound?\nWhen testing the XM6 headphones, I compared them to other elite wireless headphones and earbuds. Specifically, I've also tested the Sony XM5 headphones, Dyson OnTrac headphones, Bose QuietComfort Ultra, and Panasonic Technics AZ100s, among others. Sony's new flagship headphones definitely hold their own among other flagship cans and buds, but do they offer the best sound I've ever encountered? Not quite.\nThe new Sony headphones offer impressive audio quality, and they definitely improve on the XM5 models. The active noise cancellation is particularly phenomenal (more on that below). I really appreciated the overall balance, depth, and quality of the audio. For the XM6, Sony audio engineers worked with music mastering engineers here in the United States, and the results are clear when you listen to music. Like all headphone reviewers, I have a dedicated playlist for testing new audio products, and I found that vocal-heavy tracks sound particularly great, with noticeable improvements over the XM5s.\nWhile I tend to have weaker bass hearing, I had no trouble picking out the bass line in my favorite Radiohead tracks. As for the mid- and high-frequency range, the vocals on tracks like \"Hello\" from Adele and \"Someone You Loved\" by Lewis Capaldi rang out clearly, as did the strings in classic Mozart symphonies.\nHowever, I did have one small problem with the audio, which is a disappointment for a pair of $450 headphones. On extremely layered tracks like \"National Anthem\" from Radiohead or \"Outro\" by M83, I found the sound a little lacking in clarity. I wouldn't go so far as to call it muddy, but the soundscape did blur a touch. I also found that to truly appreciate all the richness of the XM6 sound, I had to turn the volume up a little higher than I'd like.\nHonestly, I think the Technics AZ100 earbuds have just ruined me for other audio products, as the latest Technics driver really has no equal in terms of clarity. Still, these headphones do sound very impressive, and they pass the \"bop\" test. As in, how much did I bop my head and play air drums while listening to my favorite music? If you're a music lover, I don't think you'll be disappointed with these cans.\nOne more note: If you love big-thumping bass, as I noted in my video review above, opt for the Sony ULT headphones, which prioritize bass.\nSony WH-1000XM6 Headphones review: What's new?\nSony introduced one major design change with the XM6 headphones: They now fold up for portability. The travel case is also sturdier (the XM5 travel case was truly terrible), with a magnetic closure instead of a very breakable zipper. The case may not look that much smaller in photos, but when you're stuffing them into a backpack, the compact size and shape make a big difference.\nSony also added a new processor to the headphones. The new Sony QN3 processor is seven times faster, according to Sony, and powers improved adaptive noise cancellation and better call quality thanks to \"AI beamforming\" tech. Sony also added additional microphones (12 versus the eight in the XM5) for improved noise cancellation. For phone calls, there are six dedicated mics instead of four.\nThe headband design has also been tweaked for improved comfort, and I have to say these headphones are extremely comfortable. Even while wearing them all day at the office, I didn't have any issues with comfort or ear fatigue.\nSony WH-1000XM6 Headphones review: What's not new?\nAfter three years, you might have hoped for bigger changes. I certainly did. While the foldable design is a much-appreciated change, and while there are improvements to sound, those are differences of degrees, not miles. Sony also made no improvements to battery life. The XM6 headphones have the same 30-hour battery life (with ANC engaged) as the last model. In my Dyson OnTrac review, I noted that Dyson hid extra battery packs in the headband to power its incredible 55-hour battery, but Sony seems to have opted for foldability over a battery improvement.\nThe overall aesthetic is still recognizably Sony, so if you liked the look of the XM5 headphones, you'll like the new design as well.\nTo me, they also prove that headphones have somewhat plateaued. Just look at the newest Apple AirPods Max headphones, which added USB-C charging and not much else with their most recent update. I imagine Sony and Apple audio engineers reluctantly telling their bosses, \"We can't make the drivers any better than they already are!\" That's not entirely fair, as Sony did make some tweaks for improved vocals (which you can really hear), but I do think we're reaching the peak of headphone quality, barring a big advancement in audio technology.\nTwo more important notes: First, the multi-point pairing here is absolutely seamless. I could switch between my iPhone and MacBook with no issues. Second, you can now listen to music and charge the headphones at the same time.\nSony WH-1000XM6 Headphones review: The ANC is incredible\nSony's flagship headphones have always been at the head of the pack with noise cancellation, and that legacy continues here. The ANC in the XM6 is as good as or better than any I've ever heard.\nGood noise cancellation should feel a little bit like magic. When the ANC engages, you should instantly step into a bubble of silence, and that's what you get here. With music playing, the noise cancellation is near perfect. Sure, on the subway, some sounds get through, but under normal listening conditions, it's spooky how sounds disappear. I like to use these headphones at work for their noise cancellation (with no music playing) just so I can focus better.\nOn the downside, while Sony says these headphones have adaptive noise cancellation, they don't really offer much personalization. Some Bose headphones (and the Technics earbuds I mentioned) let you fine-tune the ANC settings to your liking, which would have been a nice addition.\nThe new Sony XM6 Headphones: Just the specs\nProcessor: Sony QN3\nMicrophones: 12\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5.3 (LDAC support)\nBattery: 30 hours with ANC (40 hours without)\nCharge time: ~3.5 hours\nNoise cancellation: Active noise cancellation\nSpatial audio: Yes\nColors: Midnight blue, black, silver\nInputs: USB-C, 3.5mm audio jack\nQuick charge: 3 hours in 3 minutes\nSony WH-1000XM6 Headphones: Are they worth it?\nI say yes, absolutely. While I wouldn't say these headphones deliver the best sound I've ever heard, they come close. Add to that elite noise cancellation, a comfortable fit, and a travel-friendly design, and you have flagship headphones that justify their $450 price tag. That being said, they're not an instant upgrade if you already own the XM5 headphones. But if you have an older pair, want LDAC support, or just like the Sony product ecosystem, they're a worthy purchase, no doubt.\nWhile we don't love seeing a price increase, it has been three years since we got the XM5s. On top of that, other flagship headphones from brands like Bose, Dyson, Sonos, and Apple have all come in at $449 and above. If you're a music lover who wants the best possible sound, that's the new price of admission, folks.\nYou can buy the new Sony headphones now for $449.99 at Sony, Amazon, and Best Buy.\nTopics Music Mashable Choice Gadgets"

      "text": "The best open earbuds that stay put, sound great, and keep you aware of the world around you\nOverview\nTable of Contents\nNoise-cancelling earbuds are a popular choice for many people, but if you're someone who wants to hear the world around them or finds an in-ear design uncomfortable, there's a better option out there: open earbuds.\nThough open earbuds share the common feature of sitting on the exterior of the ear, they come in many shapes and sizes, from clip models to ear hook models. Some are more geared toward working out, while others are better for everyday use. Below, we've compiled some of the best open earbud models available in 2025. This guide is a work in progress, so we'll possibly be shifting (or expanding) our recommendations as we continue to test pairs.\nThe best headphones and speaker deals to shop this week\n-\nSoundcore by Anker P20i True Wireless Earbuds \u2014 $24.99 (List Price $39.99)\n-\nSony WH-CH520 Wireless Headphones \u2014 $38.00 (List Price $59.99)\n-\nJBL Flip 6 Portable Bluetooth Speaker \u2014 $99.00 (List Price $129.95)\n-\nBose SoundLink Flex Portable Speaker \u2014 $99.00 (List Price $149.00)\n-\nSony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones \u2014 $198.00 (List Price $349.99)\n-\nJBL Bar 300 5.0ch Compact Soundbar \u2014 $449.95\nWe spent three weeks trying out open earbuds priced for $120 to $300. Here's what we looked at:\nA major part of open earbuds appeal is that they're less obtrusive than traditional earbuds and headphones, so we made sure that all of our picks were comfortable to wear for at least a couple hours. We also made sure to exercise in the earbuds, including running and yoga, to test how well they stayed put.\nAs open earbuds project the sound into your ear, we knew these earbuds wouldn't sound the same as in-ear earbuds or over-ear headphones. With that said, we also expected the sound to have some dynamic qualities, come through clearly, and avoid any obvious peaking.\nOpen earbuds are a popular pick for folks who like to exercise, so we made sure each pair that we tested (and included on our final list) was at least sweat resistant. We played around with the maneuverability of the ear hooks and cuffs to make sure an accidental instance of putting them on a little too rough wouldn't mean the end of the earbuds.\nThanks to the lack of ANC, open earbuds generally get better battery life per charge. Still, we made sure to include pairs with decent case battery life, and that offer quick charge options because nothing is worse than getting ready for a run and realizing your earbuds are dead.\nShokz OpenDots One\nBest for most people\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Sound quality comparable to Bose earbuds\n- Impressively long battery life\n- Clip-design is lightweight and unobtrusive\n- Multipoint pairing works well\n- Silicone grip helps keep them in place during exercise\n- Touch controls are intuitively placed and work well\n- Can feel uncomfortable after several consecutive hours of wear\n- Not a ton of extra features\nOur review\nCheck out our full review of the Shokz OpenDots One.\nWho it's for\nIf you plan on using your open earbuds primarily for working out but want the option of a solid pair of earbuds too, the Shokz OpenDots One provide the best bang for your buck.\nWhy we picked this\nBrands tend to market open earbuds to folks who like to exercise, and for good reason: That's where their use case makes the most sense. Priced at $199.95, we find that the Shokz OpenDots One hit the sweet spot between providing some of the best sound you can find on open earbuds, while giving the major fitness features you want, all without breaking the bank.\nThe clip-on ear design is secure but not too snug, only causing some discomfort after multiple hours of wear (in other words, probably less time than you'll spend working out). The cuff design is helped by a silicone grip on one side of the earbud, which also acts as a touch panel, in addition to the battery barrel.\nAs great as their design is, Mashable contributor Alex Bracetti found these earbuds really shone in their audio quality, even comparing them to Bose's open earbuds: \"Shokz isn\u2019t known for its sound quality, but the OpenDots One leave quite the impression. The 11.8mm drivers deliver crisp and lively sound to keep runners fueled on long runs.\" Considering these earbuds are $100 less than the Bose, getting comparable sound is no small feat. And if you're not in love with how they sound out of the box, the equalizer settings on the Shokz app allow you to fine-tune your experience.\nWhere these earbuds definitively beat the Bose Ultra Opens is in their battery life, boasting 10 hours per charge to Bose's seven (and four with immersive audio). Their case also holds significantly more charge: 40 hours, to Bose's 19.5.\nHowever, that is where their feature list pretty much ends. It's not necessarily a negative, especially if you prefer buds that do the basics, but do them well.\nDetails\nBose Ultra Open\nBest upgrade pick\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Excellent sound quality\n- Option to use immersive audio\n- Comfortable clip design that doesn't pinch, even after hours of wear\n- Small charging case\n- Plenty of color options available\n- Tactile on-ear controls located on battery barrel\n- Multipoint connection can be touch and go\n- Battery life could be better, especially compared to other options\n- Microphone quality could be better\n- Lowest water and dust-resistance rating of any option on our list\n- Expensive\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Bose Ultra Open earbuds.\nWho it's for\nIf you want to use open earbuds but don't want to sacrifice having the best sound quality possible, the Bose Ultra Opens easily compare to in-ear options. You'll just have the shell out.\nWhy we picked this\nIt's hard not to be at least a little floored the first time you try the Bose Ultra Open earbuds \u2014 they simply sound way better than any pair of open earbuds has a right to. Sure, they can be a little more distant depending on the angle (easily adjustable) and have less of a booming bass than some in-ear designs (a plus for some people), but despite their quirks, they more than deliver on the sound front. Mashable contributor RJ Andersen writes in her review, \"The sound was well-balanced, and even with my ear completely uncovered, I didn\u2019t notice any issues with the audio sounding distant or muddy. Instead, the Ultra Open Earbuds sounded clear, natural, and pretty lush.\"\nWhile they sound great out of the box, Bose gives you the option between stereo and Immersive Audio (aka Bose's spatial audio setting) once you connect it to the companion app. Of course, you'll also have access to four equalizer presets and one custom equalizer setting. For $300, we expected to be impressed, and based on the sound alone, we were.\nBut Bose didn't stop there. Although the Ultra Opens share the same cuff-like design as our top pick earbuds, we didn't find any uncomfortable pinching or squeezing, even after hours of wear. They stood out as the most comfortable pair of open earbuds we tested. The design thoughtfulness extended to the on-ear controls, which feature a button at the top of the battery barrel that sits on the outside of your ear. The result was a control that was just as easy as a touch control to use, but way less likely to be triggered by accident.\nFor all their good, the Ultra Open earbuds aren't quite perfect. Their battery life is on the lower end, their mic quality wasn't great on calls, and their IP rating makes them the least outdoor workout-friendly. (As IPX4 earbuds, they have an unknown amount of dust resistance and splash resistance, meaning they can handle sweat fine, but might not fare as well if you're out in heavier rain). Still, while they're not the most rugged pair, they are the most premium sounding \u2014 if you mainly work out indoors, and don't find yourself on extra-long runs all that often, these drawbacks are workable.\nDetails\nAnker Soundcore AeroFit 2\nBest ear hook design\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Solid sound quality for the price\n- Tons of equalizer options\n- Adjustable ear hook helps you find the right fit\n- Has the best battery life and water and dust-resistance rating of all the earbuds we tested\n- Case has wireless charging\n- Customizable touch controls (and option to turn them off entirely)\n- Impressive language translation feature with companion app\n- Back and forth conversation with translation feature is a little awkward to use\n- Sound quality isn't as good as more expensive options\n- Didn't feel quite as secure as clip-on earbuds\nWho it's for\nIf you want open earbuds that are excellent for workouts, still great for daily use, and don't cost a ton, you want the Anker Soundcore AeroFit 2 earbuds.\nWhy we picked this\nOnce you start to get to the budget-friendlier end of open earbuds, you realize that it's not a given that they sound decent. Peaking becomes more common, you lose even more of the detail of a song, and audio leaking is more rampant. We didn't have those problems with the Anker Soundcore AeroFit 2 earbuds.\nThe newer release from the brand improved upon the older model by making the ear hook adjustable. While most ear hook earbuds come with some degree of flexibility, the AeroFits offer four locked-in angles, making them the most comfortable (and snug) open-ear hook buds we've tried so far. Despite sitting in the large case that comes with the ear hook territory, Soundcore's version here is at least lower profile.\nAs for their performance as workout earbuds, the AeroFit 2s have the best IP rating of any of our picks, being both dust protected and able to survive jets of water. They have 10 hours of battery life per charge, so even distance runners would be hard pressed to run them down in one use. The touch controls also hit the right mark for sensitivity, making them great to easily pause and play music (if you prefer, you can also turn them, and their sound queue, off entirely).\nThese earbuds surprised us most with their AI language translation feature that you can use through the companion app. Either in real-time or with a push-to-talk function, the earbuds were able to accurately translate French and Mandarin to English. Soundcore advertises that they can translate into over 100 languages. While we weren't able to get the real-time translation to work to facilitate a back-and-forth conversation, the push-to-talk allows you to speak in English, and the translation in the opposite language comes out through your device's speakers. The other person's dialogue comes through as text on the app and in audio through your earbuds, with only a slight delay. While the use cases for this feature might be more limited, we found it a clever way to leverage the open ear design that lets you engage with another person while still wearing earbuds.\nDetails\nTopics Bose\nWhat are open earbuds?\nOpen earbuds allow you to get as close as you possibly can to the feeling of not wearing earbuds at all. Unlike in-ear earbuds which sit in your ear canal (as the name states), open earbuds sit just outside your ears. Some models hold the speaker component in place with an ear hook while others opt for an ear cuff.\nPeople generally opt for open earbuds for three main reasons:\nThey provide a private listening experience while leaving you almost completely aware of the world around you. It's like the best transparency mode you've ever used.\nFor some people, not having an earbud physically in their ear is generally more comfortable.\nThe hooks and cuffs (along with the general awareness of your surroundings) make them a great option for keeping them in place, and keeping you alert, while you're working out.\nWhat are the drawbacks of open earbuds?\nAs you may have gathered from the section above, open earbuds don't generally come with active noise cancellation. That's mostly thanks to how much sound they let in (by design) and the difficulty of cancelling out sound without having the device covering your actual ear canal.\nAlso thanks to the whole open ear-canal situation, these aren't going to be the earbuds for audiophiles. That's not to say open earbuds sound bad \u2014 if you've never tried them, we promise they sound much better than you're imagining \u2014 but you will lose out on some of the nuance of a song without having the earbud actually in your ear.\nThat said, many pairs still have equalizers on their companion apps to help you make them sound their best. Our upgrade pick, the Bose Ultra Open earbuds, even have a spatial audio feature that worked surprisingly well.\nMost open earbuds will also boast some form of special technology that keeps them from leaking too much sound. While these pairs do pretty well in keeping the sound just to you, most pairs (including our picks) while be prone to some leakage, especially at higher volumes.\nFinally, some open earbuds \u2014 mainly those with ear hooks \u2014 tend to have slightly bulkier cases. If you like to travel light, it's something to be aware of.\nWhat about bone conduction headphones?\nBone conduction earbuds work exactly like the name implies they do \u2014 they use your skull to conduct sound waves, instead of projecting the sound into your ear, like most of the picks are on list. Typically, a band runs from either side of the users head to help hold the headphones in place.\nShokz, the brand behind our top pick, is a popular maker of these kinds of headphones. While we do consider them open earbuds, we have yet to test any bone conduction earbuds \u2014 look out in the future for that update. On that note:\nWhat's next in our testing pipeline\nThe open earbuds market is rapidly expanding, so we'll be testing more as we can get our hands on them. Up next, we'll be trying out budget pairs of open earbuds under $100, as well as more pairs from Shokz.\nIn addition to the earbuds that made our final guide in May 2025, we tested out the Nothing Ear (Open) earbuds ($149), the Sony Linkbuds Open ($199.99), the Anker Soundcore AeroClip earbuds ($169.99), and the Shokz OpenFit Air ($119.95). While none of the above were bad earbuds by any means, we found our picks to outshine them in their comfort and sound quality, especially when considering their respective prices.\nBethany Allard is a Los Angeles-based shopping reporter at Mashable covering beauty tech, dating, sex and relationships, and headphones. That basically means she puts her hair through a lot, scrolls through a lot of dating apps, and rotates through a lot of different headphones. In addition to testing out and rounding up the best products, she also covers deals for Mashable, paying an especially obsessive amount of attention to Apple deals and prices. That knowledge comes in handy when she's covering shopping holidays like Prime Day and Black Friday, which she's now done for three years at Mashable."

No, what my adorable niece showed me that day would forever change the course of my life.\nMario. Kart. Legos. That. Shoot. Turtle. Shells.\nAs Mashable's tech editor, I'm tasked with covering the latest gadgets and gear, but sometimes products slip through the cracks, and it takes an adorable 6-year-old to open your eyes. These Mario Kart Legos aren't new by any means, but they're new to me, and I can't stop playing with them.\nWhen I was a kid, I was obsessed with Legos. My prized possession was a Wild West jailhouse set. When you inserted a dynamite-shaped brick into the cell door, a spring blew it off its hinges. It was awesome, and a similar kind of wizardry is at play here.\nThese kits are small and simple enough that you can build them quickly with young kids, who will appreciate the turtle shell-firing mechanism as much as I did.\nNot only do these Legos make excellent gifts, but you can also pick them up at Amazon starting at just $12.99 (the Yoshi Bike set is pretty much permanently on sale for that price).\nTopics Nintendo\nTimothy Beck Werth is the Tech Editor at Mashable, where he leads coverage and assignments for the Tech and Shopping verticals.
