  "description": "The Allen Institute for AI has moved into its new 50,000-square-foot headquarters in Seattle\u2019s first large-scale mass-timber commercial building, amid major AI research announcements.",
  "content": "It was a big news week for Seattle\u2019s Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (Ai2), including the announcement of a new AI robotics initiative and a landmark grant from Nvidia and the National Science Foundation to lead the creation of the future AI backbone for U.S. scientific research.\n\nBut the nonprofit research institute also reached another milestone in recent weeks: moving into its new 50,000-square-foot headquarters in Seattle\u2019s first large-scale mass-timber commercial building.\n\nThe new Ai2 space, in the Northlake Commons project on the north shore of Lake Union, is now the central gathering and workspace for the organization and its team of about 225 people. Ai2 occupies one floor of the five-story building.\n\nIt\u2019s a short drive up the road from Ai2\u2019s prior headquarters, and within walking or biking distance of the University of Washington, where many of Ai2\u2019s researchers are also affiliated with the UW Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering.\n\nMass timber is an engineered wood product made by binding layers of wood together into strong, large structural panels and beams, providing the strength of steel or concrete with a lower carbon footprint. The mass-timber elements are visible throughout the space and common areas of the building.\n\nThe space includes large meeting rooms, private call rooms, a podcast and video studio, large doors that open up to outside patios on warm days, and a dining area and gathering space with sweeping views of Lake Union and downtown.\n\nThe interior design deliberately avoids a traditional \u201csea of desks\u201d layout in favor of smaller groupings of workstations where researchers can collaborate while remaining connected through walkways and sight lines.\n\nThere\u2019s even enough space for a simulated home environment in the Ai2 robotics lab, including two kitchens, allowing researchers to test their latest AI robotics technology in conditions that mimic a real-world household.\n\nNorthlake Commons was designed by Seattle-based architect Weber Thompson and built by general contractor Swinerton. News of the Ai2 lease was announced in July 2024.\n\nThe Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) is separate from the AI2 Incubator, which spun off from the non-profit and has its own new waterfront home, AI House, at Pier 70 on Elliott Bay.\n\nKeep scrolling for more pictures from inside the new Ai2 space.\n\nRELATED STORY: Allen Institute for AI lands $152M from Nvidia and NSF to lead national AI project",
