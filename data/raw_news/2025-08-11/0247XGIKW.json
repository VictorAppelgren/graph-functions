  "content": "If you\u2019re looking for hints and answers for Strands for Tuesday, August 12, 2025, read on\u2014I\u2019ll share some clues and tips, and finally the solution to the puzzle with the theme \u201cSpitting image.\u201d\n\nFor an easy way to come back to our Strands hints every day, . You can also find our past hints there as well, in case you want to know what you missed in a previous puzzle. (If you play , , or , check out our hints for those games, too.)\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll give you some oblique hints at today\u2019s Strands answers. And farther down the page, I\u2019ll reveal the spangram and the answers. Scroll slowly and take just the hints you need!\n\nHint for the spangram in today\u2019s Strands puzzle\n\nA two-word phrase meaning \u201cYep, I hear you.\u201d It\u2019s associated with communication via radio or walkie-talkie.\n\nHint for the theme words in today\u2019s Strands puzzle\n\nWords referring to twins or those of similar appearance.\n\nWe\u2019re about to give away the answers to today\u2019s Strands puzzle.\n\nWhat is the spangram in today\u2019s Strands?\n\nWhat are the theme words in today\u2019s Strands?\n\nHere\u2019s what the board looks like when the puzzle is solved:\n\n\u201cSpitting image\u201d is a phrase that refers to someone who looks identical to another person, usually when comparing a child to their parent.\n\nDUPLICATE is in the upper right. \ud83d\udd35\n\nCOPY is below LOOKALIKE, but it\u2019s not a theme word. Probably the start of the spangram. Yeah, it\u2019s COPYTHAT. \ud83d\udfe1 I guess that\u2019s a play on the phrase meaning \u201cI understand\u201d or \u201cI hear you.\u201d\n\nDOUBLE is in the bottom right. \ud83d\udd35\n\nFACSIMILE is to the left of DOUBLE. \ud83d\udd35\n\nYou can find the Strands game on the New York Times website and in the NYT Games app.\n\nWhen you start playing, you\u2019ll see a game board with an assortment of letters, flanked by a clue that gives a hint at the board\u2019s theme\u2014this will be a phrase, like \u201cBetter with age.\u201d Your job is to find the hidden words within the board that reflect the puzzle\u2019s theme.\n\nThe most important word to find is the \u201cspangram,\u201d a word that more explicitly states the puzzle\u2019s theme. (For example, the spangram for the puzzle with the theme \"Better with age\" is FERMENTED, which describes products that are, you guessed it, better with age.) The spangram will span the entire game board, either from left to right or top to bottom (hence the name). When you find the spangram, it will be highlighted in yellow. Solving the spangram usually makes the rest of the puzzle much easier to complete.\n\nIn Strands, words can travel any direction (up, down, left, right, and diagonal), and you will only use each letter once. There is only one correct solution. When you correctly identify one of the puzzle\u2019s words (for example, KOMBUCHA, MISO, or KIMCHI), it will be highlighted in blue.\n\nIf you are struggling to solve the puzzle, you can submit any non-theme words you see (as long as they are four letters or more) to receive credit toward a single hint. If you submit three non-theme words, the \u201cHint\u201d button will be clickable; if you click it, all of the letters in one of the theme words will be highlighted for you. You will still have to link these highlighted letters in the right order to form one of the theme words. If there is already a hint on the board and you use another hint before solving for that word, that word\u2019s letter order will be revealed.\n\nUnlike Connections and Wordle, you cannot fail Strands. When you submit guesses, you will either correctly identify an answer, receive credit toward a hint, or the text will shake back and forth, indicating that the word you submitted is too short or not valid. You can't run out of guesses, and there is no time limit.\n\nYou win when you\u2019ve correctly used all the letters on the board, meaning that you have identified the spangram and all of the theme words. Like other NYT games, upon solving the puzzle, you will see a shareable card that indicates how you performed that day: blue dots \ud83d\udd35 indicate theme words you found, the yellow dot \ud83d\udfe1 indicates when you found the spangram, and a lightbulb \ud83d\udca1 indicates words that you received a hint for.\n\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to yesterday's Strands.",

Scroll slowly and take just the hints you need!\nHint for the spangram in today\u2019s Strands puzzle\nWhat you might take home after a big meal.\nHint for the theme words in today\u2019s Strands puzzle\nEvidence of what was there before.\nBEWARE: Spoilers follow for today\u2019s Strands puzzle!\nWe\u2019re about to give away the answers to today\u2019s Strands puzzle.\nWhat is the spangram in today\u2019s Strands?\nToday\u2019s spangram is LEFTOVERS.\nWhat are the theme words in today\u2019s Strands?\nThe theme words today are: RESIDUE, VESTIGE, REMNANT, DREGS, TRACE, SOUVENIR.\nHere\u2019s what the board looks like when the puzzle is solved:\nHow I solved today\u2019s Strands\nI think today\u2019s puzzle might be about division or math, since that can result in a \u201cremainder.\u201d\nREUSE is in the upper left, but it\u2019s not a theme word. RESET isn\u2019t either. I can almost make DIVIDE, but not quite. RINSE isn\u2019t a theme word. Neither are DIVEST, DRIVE, or DRUID.\nOh, TRACE, along the right edge, is a hit. \ud83d\udd35 Maybe TRACE refers to searching or following a path, like \u201cTRACE where the spending is coming from.\u201d\nThere\u2019s LEFTOVERS from the bottom to the top. \ud83d\udfe1 Oh, so maybe TRACE is like \u201cthere\u2019s still a TRACE of the whatever left behind.\u201d\nDREGS is in the upper right. \ud83d\udd35\nSOUVENIR is in the bottom right. \ud83d\udd35 I guess that can be a thing that\u2019s leftover from a trip.\nRESIDUE is in the upper left. \ud83d\udd35\nVESTIGE is below RESIDUE. \ud83d\udd35\nLastly, REMNANT. \ud83d\udd35\nStrands #526 \u201cFind the remainder\u201d \ud83d\udd35\ud83d\udfe1\ud83d\udd35\ud83d\udd35 \ud83d\udd35\ud83d\udd35\ud83d\udd35\nHow to play Strands\nYou can find the Strands game on the New York Times website and in the NYT Games app.\nWhen you start playing, you\u2019ll see a game board with an assortment of letters, flanked by a clue that gives a hint at the board\u2019s theme\u2014this will be a phrase, like \u201cBetter with age.\u201d Your job is to find the hidden words within the board that reflect the puzzle\u2019s theme.\nA crossword crossed with a word search\nThe most important word to find is the \u201cspangram,\u201d a word that more explicitly states the puzzle\u2019s theme. (For example, the spangram for the puzzle with the theme \"Better with age\" is FERMENTED, which describes products that are, you guessed it, better with age.) The spangram will span the entire game board, either from left to right or top to bottom (hence the name). When you find the spangram, it will be highlighted in yellow. Solving the spangram usually makes the rest of the puzzle much easier to complete.\nIn Strands, words can travel any direction (up, down, left, right, and diagonal), and you will only use each letter once. There is only one correct solution. When you correctly identify one of the puzzle\u2019s words (for example, KOMBUCHA, MISO, or KIMCHI), it will be highlighted in blue.\nIf you are struggling to solve the puzzle, you can submit any non-theme words you see (as long as they are four letters or more) to receive credit toward a single hint. If you submit three non-theme words, the \u201cHint\u201d button will be clickable; if you click it, all of the letters in one of the theme words will be highlighted for you. You will still have to link these highlighted letters in the right order to form one of the theme words. If there is already a hint on the board and you use another hint before solving for that word, that word\u2019s letter order will be revealed.\nHow to win Strands\nUnlike Connections and Wordle, you cannot fail Strands. When you submit guesses, you will either correctly identify an answer, receive credit toward a hint, or the text will shake back and forth, indicating that the word you submitted is too short or not valid. You can't run out of guesses, and there is no time limit.\nYou win when you\u2019ve correctly used all the letters on the board, meaning that you have identified the spangram and all of the theme words. Like other NYT games, upon solving the puzzle, you will see a shareable card that indicates how you performed that day: blue dots \ud83d\udd35 indicate theme words you found, the yellow dot \ud83d\udfe1 indicates when you found the spangram, and a lightbulb \ud83d\udca1 indicates words that you received a hint for.\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Strands."
