They are sliced up for sharing while admiring the moon at its fullest on the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival.\nThe Post got a lesson in making traditional mooncakes from Tse Sun-fuk, a dim sum chef at the Cordis Hong Kong hotel in Mong Kok who has 30 years\u2019 experience.\nAsked if he likes making traditional mooncakes, Tse gives a typically pragmatic Hong Kong answer. \u201cI prefer making egg custard mooncakes because you just need to bake them once and they\u2019re done. With traditional mooncakes you need to bake them twice,\u201d he explains.\nNevertheless he was game to demonstrate how to make the hotel\u2019s signature white lotus paste mooncakes with double salted egg yolks."
