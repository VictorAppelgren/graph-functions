      "summary": "Tracee Ellis Ross revealed an awkward TSA moment on Jimmy Kimmel Live when agents opened her carry‑on and found personal bedside items, prompting her to laugh about her strict rule‑following and battery‑packing habits.  She used the experience to highlight her new Roku Channel series that chronicles her solo travels to Morocco, Spain and Mexico, noting that she often checks multiple bags and follows a “bring it all” policy.  The article also references related PEOPLE pieces, including Southwest Airlines’ new lithium‑battery restrictions, Nicole Byer’s travel hacks, and a retrospective on the Black‑ish cast’s career.  Together, the pieces paint a picture of celebrity travel culture and evolving airline safety measures.",
