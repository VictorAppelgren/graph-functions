  "title": "I Plugged a Tiny Battery Into the Bottom of My Phone",
  "description": "Smaller is more convenient, until it's not.",
  "content": "I like portable power banks, so I figured I'd take a chance on a small one that plugs into the bottom of my phone. It looks incredibly convenient, but it isn't without its downsides.\n\nA small battery is precisely that\u2014 a small battery. Mine is an Anker Nano battery with a 5000 mAh battery. That's only slightly bigger than the battery inside my phone.\n\nIn theory, a battery the size of my phone should be good for one full charge. In reality, energy is lost when transferred from one battery to another. That means when my external battery is fully charged, I can't expect it to get my phone back up to 100%. The situation is even worse if you're using a small battery that relies on wireless charging, where even more energy is lost in transmission.\n\nThis isn't as big a problem as it may seem. A battery this size is better used as a top-up to help your phone make it through the end of the day. The battery is large enough to get my phone from 10% back to 80%, no problem. I rarely need a full 0 to 100% charge.\n\nI just want to make sure you're aware of this going in. If you're going on a camping trip and think you might need more juice, you'll want to have a larger battery on hand.\n\nIf you really want to go the MagSafe route, it's worth paying a little extra for the 10,000mAh option. One of my colleagues won't travel without his MagSafe battery, so that's one endorsement.\n\nCan Your USB-C Port Handle the Weight?\n\nModern phones don't have all that many moving parts. That's true even on foldable phones like my Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6. On most phones, the USB-C port is the component that sees the most wear and tear from everyday use. It's the component most likely to break.\n\nA battery like mine puts even more weight on this port. That added pressure is present no matter how I use it. If I hold my phone normally, the battery is pulling down. If I hold my phone in landscape, the battery puts pressure off to the side.\n\nI've used the battery in this way to keep my phone alive during lengthy writing sessions. After all, I write every word I post online directly on my phone. My phone's large internal screen, combined with its average-size battery, means I often need to charge before my workday is up. I thought a battery like this would allow me to keep on writing, but I feel too uncomfortable to rely on it heavily.\n\nMy Phone Does Not Lie Flat While Charging\n\nLet's say I opt not to carry the phone while it's charging and place it down on a table. Even then, I don't feel all that comfortable.\n\nSince the battery is thicker than my phone, my phone ends up resting at an angle. In this position, the battery is actually applying upward pressure on the USB port. The weight is distributed in such a way that my phone is propped up by its USB-C port.\n\nHolding my phone while the battery is plugged in also introduces some awkward weight distribution. The battery pushes against my hand when in use while vertical, making it difficult to type. As a result, I tend to rotate my phone horizontally. Once I do, now all the weight is concentrated on the top-right.\n\nThese are things that don't matter that much if your phone is just being used to browse the web or respond to a quick message, but it\u2019s something to note if you\u2019re using a battery to make it until the end of a lengthy YouTube documentary or finish an online gaming session.\n\nWere I using a MagSafe-style battery, I'd be faced with a different set of issues. My USB port would be fine, but I'm still left holding a thick phone.\n\nPersonally, I rather plug a long charging cable into a regularly sized battery bank. Navigating around the cable is less of a bother than the added weight.\n\nThese small batteries are best used when out of the house, so it\u2019s ideal to keep them in a spot next to your other everyday carry. Keep them in your travel bag or purse. Leave them by your wallet and keys.\n\nIf you do leave the battery lying around in different places, it\u2019s easier to lose than you might think. The battery isn\u2019t as small as a USB stick, but it\u2019s not much larger than a key fob. It also easily blends in with things. My larger, rectangular battery banks are much easier to spot as we use them around the house.\n\nIf you commute to work each day or have a job that keeps you outdoors, this small battery can be a godsend. It adds very little bulk to a bag and is small enough to keep tucked in a pocket\u2014and it supplies enough extra juice to make sure your phone stays alive until you get home.\n\nBut if you\u2019re in any environment where a larger battery bank isn\u2019t an inconvenience, I\u2019d recommend sticking with one of those instead. They last longer, put less weight on your phone, and are easier to keep up with.",

      "text": "Quick Links\nThere was a time when I, like many people, did most of my \"computing\" from a laptop. Now, I use my phone as my primary computer and no longer have a traditional PC to fall back on. Perhaps surprisingly, this hasn't hindered my ability to work remotely.\nSome Smartphones Are Great At Multitasking\nPart of what allows us to get so much done from computers is the size of their screens, but that's not all there is to it. I found that what's just as important is the way our devices are able to multitask.\nMy Galaxy Z Fold 5 provides many ways to switch between apps. The default taskbar mirrors what we see on a PC, but that's only one option. I love putting two apps side-by-side or shrinking apps into small windows and tucking them away in a corner.\nSmartphone apps have gotten good enough that when you're able to use more than one at a time quickly, it's surprising how much you can get done. I still wouldn't want to work on a conventionally sized smartphone, but once a device hits seven inches and starts to feel like a small tablet, I've discovered that it's big enough for me, as long as the interface can keep up.\nA Desktop Mode Like Samsung DeX Is Essential\nTo be clear, some tasks simply require a larger screen. If I'm trying to design a website or work with a spreadsheet, I want something larger. But the issue isn't that my phone isn't powerful enough or that it lacks the necessary software. All I need is the option to plug my phone into a larger display.\nSamsung gives me that. For years, Samsung has offered a full-blown Android desktop mode known as DeX. If you can get everything you need done from a Chromebook, then chances are you can also do your work from DeX. I, frankly, have many uses for Samsung DeX.\nMotorola is another option. The company offers Smart Connect on its higher-end phones. I found that it is not as mature as DeX, but it's very close. OnePlus phones and newer Pixel phones now mirror displays when connected to an external monitor. I wouldn't be as comfortable doing away with my PC if screen mirroring were my only option, but it's better than nothing. Google does admittedly have its own Android desktop in the works, but it has been barebones for years.\nThere's an App for Most of What I Need\nI remember the early days of Android when I was waiting for new apps to come out to do what I could do on my laptop. For me, those days have passed. While there are still areas where the Android app may not be quite as good, in almost every case, it's good enough.\nMany Android web browsers offer a desktop-like tab bar when they're on a larger screen, including baked-in options like Google Chrome or Samsung Internet, as well as third-party alternatives like Vivaldi. There are office suites ranging from Google Docs and Microsoft 365 to competitors like OfficeSuite and Polaris Office. There are Adobe apps that may not be all a professional video editor needs, but they're more than competent enough for someone doing the basics like me. If someone sends me a PDF, I can view it, annotate it, and send it back.\nMost of the Rest Can Be Done In a Browser\nThere are occasional edge cases where a mobile app doesn't exist, or the mobile app is missing features that I need. The thing is, so much computing these days is done on the web anyway. For niche tasks like converting one file type to another or stripping the DRM from an eBook, there's usually a website that can make it happen.\nCloud computing and websites have changed what's possible. You don't need a powerful CPU or graphics card to do intensive tasks if you have a fast internet connection that can handle it instead.\nThanks to cloud gaming, I don't even need a PC to access my existing Steam library. My preferred way to play has become plugging AR glasses into my phone and using a Bluetooth gamepad. This is through an app, not a browser, but the point's the same\u2014you don't necessarily need native versions of apps or games in order to run them on your phone.\nFor Some Tasks, Working With a Phone Is Faster\nTo my surprise, using a mobile app is often quicker than doing the same task on a PC. It's easier to share files from a phone interface than a laptop. The latter is more inclined to nudge you toward a file manager, while phones are quicker to help you share directly from an app. I can take a photo on my phone, apply quick touch-ups, and upload it in less time than it would take for me to return to a PC and transfer the files.\nI was surprised how quickly I was able to do taxes this year from a mobile app. Many smartphone apps let you skip passwords and use your fingerprint. Slack on the desktop may have more features, but I find it easier to navigate on the phone, which leads to me being more engaged.\nVideo Chat Apps All Support Phones\nEven though I've worked remotely for my entire adult life, I haven't spent much time on video calls. Yet when the need arises, this is an area phones handle just fine. No matter which service someone wants to chat using, a mobile app is available. Not only that, in my case, a phone has both a better webcam and a better mic than my laptop did.\nIf you regularly host meetings and have to give presentations, then a phone probably won't be ideal. Being able to share your screen and view participants isn't a strength of small screens. Fortunately for me, I'm usually on the other end of Zoom calls, and a phone has served me well.\nMost Accessories Work With Phones\nHow well you can work from a phone depends in large part on what accessories you invest in. I find that a cheap phone stand (seriously, one of my favorite phone accessories), a Bluetooth keyboard, and a Bluetooth mouse can be all the productivity boost I need most days.\nWhen I want a more traditional setup, I have a lapdock that I can either connect to via a USB-C cable (for the best experience) or wirelessly. I also have a USB-C hub for connecting to external monitors or TVs. More often than not, though, I turn to my AR glasses when I want to use Samsung DeX.\nMy Samsung S Pen is a vital part of my workflow. I have a USB-C flash drive for backing up and transferring files. I also have a Bluetooth gamepad for when I want to game. All of these accessories just work, no additional fuss required. Doing without a PC would be much harder without them.\nAs phones get more powerful year after year, for many of us, there will increasingly be less need to have a separate computer. At this point, it's just a matter of waiting for better apps that can replace desktop software for people with more demanding needs than my own. And it would be nice to see more companies provide alternatives to Samsung DeX, which, for the time being, is still the best option for anyone looking to kiss their PC goodbye."

      "text": "Summary\n- Refined screen sizes, decreased weight, and polished software make the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 a solid choice.\n- Despite some downsides, like app optimization and no Qi2 magnetic charging, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is still worth the hefty $1900 price tag.\n- Samsung's improvements in hardware design and software AI features make the Galaxy Z Fold 6 a compelling foldable phone option.\nIn the U.S., Samsung has led the foldable market. Now that competition is increasing, the company is under pressure to innovate. Unfortunately, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 isn't groundbreaking, but with this year's improvements, I have no problem recommending this phone.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6\n- SoC\n- Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 3 for Galaxy\n- Display\n- 7.6-inch AMOLED inside display, 6.3-inch AMOLED cover display, both with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate\n- RAM\n- 12GB\n- Storage\n- 256GB, 512GB, 1TB\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a foldable smartphone that combines the functionality of a tablet with the convenience of a phone. It features a large, flexible internal screen that automatically picks up where you left off on the cover display.\n- Refined and improved screen sizes\n- Decreased weight\n- Polished software experience\n- Not all apps (but most) are optimized for the internal display\n- No Qi2 charging\n- Almost twice the cost of a traditional Android smartphone\nPrice and Availability\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 6 costs $100 more than 2023's Fold 5, retailing for $1,899.99 with 256GB of built-in storage. The 512GB and 1TB models cost $2,019.00 and $2,259.99, respectively. All three spec tiers have 12GB of RAM and the Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 3 for Galaxy.\nThe foldable can be purchased from almost every carrier and third-party retailer and is available in Pink, Navy, and Silver Shadow (the color I tested). If you buy directly from Samsung, you can also choose from Crafted Black (with a textured back) and White.\nSpecifications\n- SoC\n- Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 3 for Galaxy\n- Display\n- 7.6-inch AMOLED inside display, 6.3-inch AMOLED cover display, both with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate\n- RAM\n- 12GB\n- Storage\n- 256GB, 512GB, 1TB\n- Battery\n- 4,400 mAh\n- Ports\n- USB-C\n- Operating System\n- Android 14 / One UI 6.1.1\n- Front camera\n- 10MP cover camera, 4MP under-display main screen camera\n- Rear camera\n- 10MP 3x optical zoom, f/2.4, 12MP ultra-wide, f/2.2, 50MP main camera with autofocus, f/1.8\n- Connectivity\n- 5G, 4G LTE, 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax 2.4GHz+5GHz+6GHz Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, UWB\n- Dimensions\n- 68.1 x 153.5 x 12.1mm (folded); 132.6 x 153.5 x 5.6mm (unfolded)\n- Colors\n- Navy, Silver Shadow, Pink, Crafted Black, White\n- Weight\n- 239g\n- Charge speed\n- 25W wired, 15W wireless, Wireless PowerShare\n- IP Rating\n- IP48\n- Stylus\n- S Pen for Galaxy\nHardware Improvements You'll Feel\nEven if you stared at the Z Fold 6 and the Fold 5, I highly doubt you could figure out which phone is which. Samsung nailed down its design last year, finally making it so that the handset folded flat. But the moment you pick up the Fold 6, you'll feel a difference.\nThe most noticeable difference out of the box is the weight. The Fold 6 comes in at 239g, which shaves off 14g compared to last year's model. That's only 7g heavier than the Galaxy S24 Ultra. We're finally at a point where Samsung's largest foldable doesn't feel like a brick or two phones taped together in your pocket.\nHowever, slightly adjusted dimensions and screen sizes are the most welcome changes. When folded, the phone is 1mm wider and 1.3mm thinner than the Fold 5. That doesn't sound like much, but it makes the Z Fold 6's cover display feel that much closer to a \"traditional\" smartphone. I found myself using it much more than with previous generations, only unfolding the device when I wanted to multitask or use a tablet-sized screen.\nThose changes also affect the inside display. When unfolded, the Fold 6 is 1.4mm shorter, 2.7mm wider, and .5mm thinner than last year's handset. I have always preferred shorter and wider designs after using the Google Pixel Fold and OnePlus Open. It's easier to use the cover display, reach the top of the screen, and offer a better widescreen experience. I'm happy to see Samsung move in this direction.\nThe cherry on top is the frame's flat edge, found all the way around the phone. It makes the Fold 6 feel slimmer and more premium. Plus, the edges and back glass are matte, which is always preferred over polished metal. The corners are a bit sharper, which means it's not quite as comfortable to hold, but I forgot about this a day into using the foldable.\nI've gotten pretty accustomed to large camera bumps, but they cause an annoyance on the Fold 6 that I didn't completely notice until I read a piece by my colleague Will Sattelberg on Android Police. As he points out, having the three cameras lined up in the top-left corner of the device causes the phone to be extremely wobbly when placed on a table. It's so unstable that it's uncomfortable to interact with the foldable. I almost always pick up the device when checking notifications.\nAlso, the Z Fold 6 is still incredibly slippery despite the matte back glass. I once had it slide off my bedside table. I don't know if the camera bumps worsened the situation, but I'd feel better if the device wasn't lying awkwardly every time I sat it down.\nThe AMOLED displays themselves are as great as ever. They both have a variable 120Hz refresh rate and a 2600nits peak brightness, making all content look good whether you're inside or outside.\nThe same goes for battery life. The Z Fold 6 retains the 4,400mAh battery found in the Fold 5, but Samsung claims several extra hours of juice while watching videos or listening to audio. In my real-world testing, it was difficult to nail down an average screen-on battery life because they varied greatly depending on whether I used the cover or the inside screen for most of the day.\nI could always make it through to the end of the day, but some nights, I ended with under 15% left. That normally equated to five and a half to six and a half hours of screen-on time.\nOne UI Is Perfected for Foldable (and AI)\nSamsung, which adds its own touch and flair to Android, offers the Fold 6 a good mix of easy-to-use multitasking features while retaining heavier customization features in the Settings menu for those who like to tinker.\nLike desktop operating systems, the Z Fold 6 has a taskbar that hosts shortcuts to your most important apps and the app drawer. Once you have an app open, you can use the taskbar to drag and drop a second (or a third or a fourth) app in another section of the internal screen. Then, you can tap on the indicators between or above each app to adjust sizing, swap out apps, and more.\nThe experience is incredibly intuitive after playing with the phone for several hours. Having both my password manager and two-factor authentication apps open alongside others while setting up the phone is incredibly powerful.\nThankfully, roughly 95% of my apps scaled properly during my time with the foldable, whether I was using the more narrow cover display or the wide, tablet-sized inside screen.\nFor those that don't play nice, you can go into the Z Fold 6's Settings menu and set the aspect ratio specifically for that app. So, instead of launching in full screen, you can choose between 16:9 and 4:3. It's not a perfect solution, but it's a good stop-gap until developers update their apps.\nSamsung went all-in on \"Galaxy AI\" in January 2024 with the launch of the S24 Series. This included the launch of Circle to Search with Google, Interpreter mode, and more. Those same features, plus some extras, made their way to the Fold 6.\nTwo of the flagship AI features are Drawing Assist and Photo Assist. The first provides you with a blank canvas to sketch on. From there, you can choose an art style and generate several versions of your drawing. This feature doesn't take too many creative licenses and mostly sticks to the shape you drew.\nPhoto Assist takes a different approach. Found in the Gallery app, you take any photo and draw what you'd like added to the scene, such as a tree, bird, dog, or butterfly. Tap the Generate button and wait a hot second. Before you know it, the Z Fold 6 offers you several options to choose from. I've included a selection of samples above.\nWhile I'm still in awe that Samsung was able to understand my truly awful drawings and correctly insert the object or animal I drew, none of these look exactly natural. Others, like The Verge, have had better results. Allison Johnson drew a bee next to an out-of-focus flower, and her Z Fold 6 inserted an equally out-of-focus bee. It looks surprisingly realistic, and I would have never guessed it was AI-generated.\nSpeaking of which, Samsung automatically adds an \"AI-generated content\" watermark to the bottom-left corner of every one of these images. The issue is that this watermark is almost transparent and can easily be cropped out of the frame. While I don't think anyone will be fooled by my images, it won't be long before this tech is perfected.\nAs both of these new AI features require you to draw, they would benefit from an S Pen. Thankfully, the inside screen supports Samsung's stylus, but one does not come with the $1,900 phone like it does with the S24 Ultra. Instead, you'll have to purchase a $130 case or the S Pen by itself. While I understand the choice not to include a built-in slot for space-saving and battery-related reasons, throwing one in the box would have helped promote the new AI features.\nStop Advertising on $2,000 Phones\nSamsung has been known to push notifications to advertise upcoming announcements. I'm sad to report that it's still happening on the Fold 6. More than once, I felt the phone buzz, only to find an ad prompting me to pre-order the Z Flip 6 or Z Fold 6. Beyond the irony that this message was being sent to a Fold 6, it was common for this notification to be pushed twice in the span of a couple of minutes.\nIt shouldn't need to be said, but Samsung has to stop dropping advertisements on its customers. I can forgive the company if it places a banner ad in its apps, but to push a notification multiple times is ridiculous.\nThe Cameras Have Gone Mostly Untouched\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 has five cameras: a 10MP selfie camera on the cover display, a new 12MP ultra-wide, 50MP wide, 10MP 3x telephoto, and a 4MP under-display camera (more on that below).\nI've included image samples taken outside on a sunny day, inside a store, using Portrait mode with 2x zoom, night shots, and several selfies. Overall, the photos all came out pretty sharp, with plenty of contrast. I don't think they're equal to what you can capture using Samsung's flagship smartphone (or even Google's Pixel 8a), but they're more than adequate.\nThe main difference between the new 12MP ultrawide and last year's is that it is better optimized for shooting in low light. Beyond that, the image quality is basically on par with what you might have experienced with the Fold 5.\nIn basically every instance, I preferred the look of selfies captured using the rear-facing cameras. They're more natural-looking, the color is more accurate, and the scene doesn't look as compressed.\nSamsung makes it pretty easy for you to swap between cameras, but there's a taking-photos-with-a-13in-iPad-type of awkwardness with an unfolded handset. Plus, you have to grip the more fragile inside screen, which is a bit nerve-wracking.\nIt's Time to Drop the Under-Display Camera\nThe promise of under-display cameras was that you would maintain a selfie camera while not losing screen real estate. Unfortunately, despite Samsung using this tech for multiple years, the image quality is still terrible.\nAs you can see from the first two photos above, pixels cover about half of the camera when you're interacting with the phone. But when you launch the camera, they disappear. When you take a selfie, Samsung processes the image and tries to fill in missing details. Despite this work, you still have a soft and out-of-focus-looking photo.\nIt's 2024. At this point, most consumers are used to and fine with hole punches, notches, and Dynamic Islands. I never found myself actually needing to use the inside display's selfie camera, but if I had, I would have tried to find a way to use any of the foldable's other sensors. The under-display camera is potato quality and should be replaced or removed completely.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6 Is Also Worth Considering\nThe Z Flip 6 will launch alongside the Z Fold 6. Despite it also including a foldable display with ultra-thin glass, it targets a different audience. Instead of someone who wants a large, 2-in-1 device, the Flip 6 is all about minimalism and convenience. It's a small and pocketable package with a cover display for quickly checking notifications and a standard phone-sized internal screen for everything else.\nUnlike the Fold, the Flip has fewer noticeable improvements but's also slightly thinner and lighter. The most notable year-over-year change is the improved camera sensors. It gained the 50MP sensor found on the Galaxy S24 series, allowing you to capture sharper images. Camera quality has always been poor on the Flip series, so this is a welcome change.\nHow-To Geek will have a review of the Z Flip 6 published shortly, but in the meantime, you can read my thoughts after a brief hands-on.\nShould You Buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6?\nI've really enjoyed testing the Galaxy Z Fold 6 over the past week and a half. Its ability to function as both a phone and a tablet has been great. I can comfortably use the cover display as a regular phone and then easily multitask with two to four apps at once on the inside screen, something I can't do with my primary smartphone (an iPhone). The foldable finally feels like a finished product that shouldn't be reserved for early adopters.\nIf you have a Z Fold 5 or the OnePlus Open, there is basically no reason to rush out and spend $1,900 on the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The improved dimensions, more rugged hinge, and IP48 rating aren't worth replacing last year's handsets. But if you're considering a foldable phone for the first time, the Z Fold 6 is a fantastic starting point.\nHowever, you have to consider that Google will launch the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in less than a month. Last year's model was far from a success, with a hinge that didn't unfold flat, but I have high hopes for the second generation. If camera performance is a high priority for you, I'd consider holding off until we see what comes out of the Googleplex.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6\n- SoC\n- Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 3 for Galaxy\n- Display\n- 7.6-inch AMOLED inside display, 6.3-inch AMOLED cover display, both with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate\n- RAM\n- 12GB\n- Storage\n- 256GB, 512GB, 1TB\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a foldable smartphone that combines the functionality of a tablet with the convenience of a phone. It features a large, flexible internal screen that automatically picks up where you left off on the cover display."

      "text": "Quick Links\nI've long thought of portable power backs as having two purposes\u2014providing power when traveling or when the power's out. Turns out these batteries are worth using around the house, even when the power's on. Here's why I've started leaving batteries lying around everywhere.\n4 I Can Charge Anywhere in the House\nI live in a home with an open-concept layout. In the living room, our sofa sits in the middle, far from any walls or outlets. The same is true of our dining table. The furniture in our bedroom, too, is all at least a couple feet from the nearest outlet. Many of the places where we often want to use devices require an extra-long charging cable or extension cord to reach.\nWe initially thought of expensive solutions, like having power outlets in the floor (that's against code in our area, turns out). We could run surge protectors to where we need them to be, then cover up the cords, but that still seemed like a tripping hazard.\nThe best solution was more simple: just get portable power banks. Smaller banks are suitable for phones and tablets. More powerful power banks, like the Anker Power Bank 25k, are available for more thirsty devices like a laptop or Nintendo Switch. With these, it no longer matters at all where the nearest outlet is, and we're still charging at the same speeds.\n-\nAnker Zolo 10K Portable Charger\nIf you're looking for a fast and affordable portable charger for all your gear, the Anker Zolo 10K power bank is the perfect solution. With 30W fast charging and a built-in USB-C cable that doubles as a lanyard, this one device does it all.\n-\nAnker 25K Power Bank (165W, Built-In and Retractable Cables)\n- Output Power\n- 165W Max\n- Color\n- Silver or space gray\n- Battery Capacity\n- 25,000mAh\n- Cable included\n- Two attached cables\n- Charging Ports\n- Two available ports\n- Weight\n- 21oz (595g)\nNever run out of power, whether you're charging smartphones, tablets, or other USB-enabled devices. Connect up to four at once thanks to dual USB-C Cables, a USB-A port, and a USB-C port.\n3 I Have the Mobility to Move Around\nRelying on a power outlet means being tethered to a wall while a device charges. In our home, this also means setting up wires for family members to trip over. When that happens, both people end up mildly frustrated with the other, and justifiably so.\nBattery banks not only cut the cord, so to speak, but they provide the freedom to move around. I can charge my phone in the kitchen while cooking, then move it with me to the dining table without interrupting the charging session. Many battery banks are small enough that I can comfortably hold one and my phone at the same time while walking.\nI have a 5,000mAh Anker Nano power bank that plugs into the bottom of my phone like an oversized flash drive. Its entire purpose is to make charging an act that doesn't get in the way.\nThis type of battery is one of many reasons I don't care how big my phone's battery is anymore. Charging has become so abundant and easy.\n2 I'm Better Prepared for Emergencies\nI give a lot of thought to being prepared for emergencies. I lived through several hurricanes as a kid, and the vulnerability of being without power, particularly in a rural area with fallen trees and no running water, stuck with me. Relying on a gas generator felt like being on borrowed time, since gas runs out daily, and the lines at stations can mean being separated from my family for hours. And that's not even getting to my sensitivity to the fumes and loud noise.\nI've been grateful for modern technology and the chance to power my home with portable power stations big and small instead.\nSmaller portable power banks build up my home's resiliency. We're up to seven of these smaller batteries, no larger than 10,000mAh, that are each able to recharge a phone at least once. Most are good for two charges. That reduces the strain on our larger power stations and greatly extends the number of days we can go in an emergency before we need to recharge.\nRealistically, we've built up a large enough stash of batteries and portable solar chargers that, while outages still require us to change our energy usage, we are at very low risk of ever being completely without power.\n1 Batteries Are Almost as Cheap as Wall Chargers\nSmaller portable battery banks are priced low enough that they're almost impulse buys\u2014and that's before they go on sale. I grabbed six of the seven power banks I mentioned as open box deals from Best Buy. I'm tempted to grab a few more.\nMy wife wanted our family to go out for dinner recently, and the price of food and ice cream for four was enough to buy five more batteries. Do we need that many batteries? No. I say this only to illustrate how cheap batteries have gotten (or how expensive everything else has become).\nA reputable 20W wall charger can go for around $10\u2013$20. This is in the same ballpark as many portable battery banks, especially when they're on sale. Sure, it's easier to find a charging block for under $10 than a decent battery, but the gap isn't as big as you might think. And our newer batteries can certainly charge devices faster than the stash of slow, old USB charging bricks that we haven't culled yet.\nRelying heavily on portable power isn't without its downsides. You have to regularly charge these batteries, so it helps to have a charging station set up somewhere. I have an Anker Prime 200W charging hub at my office desk that can charge several batteries at once. It makes keeping these power banks topped up no problem at all."

      "text": "Summary\n- Anker's $40 MagSafe battery pack is a game-changer for hassle-free charging while traveling.\n- The battery pack eliminates the need for extra cables and chargers, providing a convenient 100% recharge.\nI've spent a lot of time on the road. Or should I say, in the air. I've flown about 75,000 miles a year for the last several years. And in that time, this simple iPhone accessory has become my must-have travel companion.\nAlthough Apple's latest Apple silicon-powered MacBooks have cured my power anxiety when it comes to my laptop, my iPhone still feels the pain every time I head to the airport. Mapping my way to the airport, listening to podcasts, checking my flight status, and more\u2014routine travel activities are a big battery drain.\nThe solution? A simple iPhone accessory. And no, it's not a wall charger and a cable\u2014but close! It's the one piece of tech I simply won't travel without.\nThe accessory in question is a humble MagSafe battery pack. MagSafe debuted on the iPhone 12, and yet it took me until the iPhone 14 to truly fall in love with the tech. And not because I use it for charging at home or docking my phone at my desk, though many of my colleagues rave about MagSafe in all areas of their lives. My love of MagSafe is simple and focused on just this one accessory: the battery pack.\nI use a relatively cheap $40 MagSafe battery from Anker, and this one purchase means I never have to worry about my phone dying or hunting for a wall plug at an airport or coffee shop. Better yet, I don't have to think about carrying an extra USB cable and charger, which never fit in a pocket as cleanly as this little pack does. I just pull out the battery, slap it on the back of my phone, and I have a worry-free 100% recharge over the next couple of hours.\nSure, recharging the battery via wireless charging isn't as fast as a wall charger, it makes the phone a bit heavy and cumbersome, and it gets a little warm. But again, I repeat, thanks to a little slap-on magnetic battery pack I do not need to worry about cables or chargers. I'll take all of those little trade-offs in order to keep going about my day without ever being worried about charging.\nSure, I could always opt for a bigger phone for a little more battery life. But even though I have pretty big hands, I haven't given in and resorted to the \"Max\" iPhone\u2014because, frankly, I'd only buy one for the battery life. I don't feel the need for the extra screen size. So why would I carry around this bigger phone all the time when I only need the extra battery some of the time? I'd rather have a phone that fits in my pocket and bring the battery with me for travel days. It's the perfect solution, and it only cost me $40.\nOnce you start looking, you'll find lots of variations of the MagSafe battery pack to suit your specific needs (but not first-party, though, because, oddly, Apple discontinued its own version). Anker makes one that pulls double duty with a kickstand, and a huge 10,000mAh one if you're a real power user\u2014though the latter seems a bit overkill. There are slimmer ones and heftier ones. And some have a built-in charging cable, too, if you want that extra utility to charge other devices.\nBut no matter which one you choose it's a great way to make the most of MagSafe even if you haven't given it a second glance before. And trust me, MagSafe fan or not, you're going to want one of these handy battery packs for those long days away from home."

  "argos_summary": "The article discusses the pros and cons of using a small portable power bank, specifically the Anker Nano with a 5000 mAh capacity. While it is convenient for topping up a phone's battery, it may not provide a full charge due to energy loss during transfer, making it more suitable for light use rather than heavy reliance. The author also highlights potential issues with weight distribution on the phone's USB-C port and suggests that larger power banks may be better for extended use or emergencies.",
