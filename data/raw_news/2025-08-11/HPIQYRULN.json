  "description": "During Trump's rambling announcement that he's sending the National Guard to DC, it became clear he has caught Sleepy Joe Biden's cognitive decline.",
  "content": "\u2022 President Trump mistakenly stated he was meeting with Vladimir Putin in Russia, when the meeting is scheduled for Alaska.\n\u2022 Trump's responses to questions about deploying the National Guard to other cities were rambling and incoherent, raising concerns about his mental acuity.\n\u2022 Trump's actions seem reminiscent of Biden's past gaffes. Will the media apply similar scrutiny?\n\nDuring President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he\u2019s sending the National Guard to Washington, DC, to fight a crime wave that isn\u2019t real, it became clear he has caught Sleepy Joe Biden\u2019s much-ballyhooed cognitive decline.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how it happened. I imagine the liberals figured out a way to make a concerning lack of mental acuity contagious.\n\nBut whatever the cause, hearing the president ramble incoherently during a nationally televised press conference left no doubt: The man\u2019s brain has turned to oatmeal.\n\nTrump thinks he's meeting Putin in Russia. It will actually happen in Alaska.\n\nFor starters, on two separate occasions Trump told reporters he will be meeting later this week with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia. The meeting will be held in Alaska, which, unless Trump has given away one of America\u2019s states to Putin, is very much not in Russia.\n\nA mistake like that from Biden would have prompted Republicans to launch a congressional investigation into his competency and CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper to pen a book on the presidential competency scandal of a generation. Two mistakes like that from Biden would have effectively spun the U.S. media into a months-long cyclone of speculation and hysteria.\n\nRemember how important mental decline was when Biden was president\n\nSo I\u2019m sure all Americans who have displayed deep concern about the importance of world-leader lucidity will meet the moment with an appropriate number of gasps, pearl clutches and calls for an immediate mental-fitness exam.\n\nBecause the \u201cI\u2019m going to Russia!\u201d confusion was just a part of Trump\u2019s troubling Aug. 11 performance.\n\nTrump's word salad answers are getting more concerning\n\nAsked a specific question about whether other cities like Chicago and Los Angeles might expect \u201csimilar action\u201d involving the use of the National Guard to combat \u201ccrime,\u201d Trump said, in part, this:\n\n\u201cBut when I look at Chicago and I look at L.A., if we didn\u2019t go to L.A. three months ago, L.A. would be burning like the part that didn\u2019t burn. If you would\u2019ve allowed the water come down, which I told them about in my first term, I said, 'you\u2019re going to have problems, let it come down'. We actually sent in our military to have the water come down into L.A. They still didn\u2019t want it to come down after the fires. But that was it, we have it coming down. But hopefully L.A. is watching. That mayor also, the city is burning, they lost like 25,000 homes. I went there the day after the fire, you were there, and I saw people standing in front of a burned-down home. Their homes were incinerated, they weren\u2019t like, even the steel, literally it was all warped, literally disintegrated because of the wind and the flames like a blow torch. They were standing on this beautiful day, maybe a couple of days after, we gave it a little time because of what they had suffered. Almost 25,000 homes. And you see what\u2019s happening now, they didn\u2019t give their permits. I went to a town hall meeting I said we\u2019re going to get you the federal permit, which are much harder.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the sort of thing you hear before having to make a difficult decision about grandpa\u2019s future. That it came from a sitting president waging domestic war against a crime emergency in a city that currently does not have a crime emergency seems, at best, troubling.\n\nTime for the 'Biden is incompetent' folks to perk up\n\nI wish a reporter had asked Trump what \u201cL.A. would be burning like the part that didn\u2019t burn\u201d means. I wish a reporter had asked the president if the DC crime wave he kept referring to was in the room with them as they spoke.\n\nBut there was no pushback.\n\nThe Fox News folks and the right-wing radio squawkers and the Republicans who called the former president a dithering old fool need to start worrying about the competency of the current president.\n\nYou know, the one who\u2019s going to Alaska and thinks he\u2019s going to Russia. The one who answers a question about sending the National Guard to U.S. cities by babbling about water, fires and federal building permits. The one who has clearly gone, as critics of Biden\u2019s mental acuity would call it, \u201cfull Sleepy Joe.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke on Bluesky at @rexhuppke.bsky.social and on Facebook at facebook.com/RexIsAJerk",

  "summary": "President Donald Trump has made several statements concerning his mental health during a press conference, including mistakenly stating he was meeting with Vladimir Putin in Russia, when the meeting is scheduled for Alaska. His responses to questions about deploying the National Guard to other cities raised concerns about his mental acuity. These comments were reminiscent of previous instances of President Joe Biden's cognitive decline. The confusion was part of a larger effort to address a crime wave that was not real, but a crime emergency in a city that does not currently have a crime rate. Despite these errors, there is no pushback from Republicans or media outlets for questioning the president's competency. The author suggests that the media should focus on this issue more closely.",

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump, a convicted criminal who pardoned 400 violent felons who assaulted police officers in his name, on Monday announced he was deploying National Guard troops and seizing control of the capital\u2019s police force to deal with crime there, which he falsely claimed was \u201ctotally out of control.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\u201d Trump told reporters in the White House briefing room. \u201cThis is Liberation Day in D.C., and we\u2019re going to take our capital back. We\u2019re taking it back under the authorities vested in me as the president of the United States.\u201d\nTrump previewed his action Sunday and early Monday in a series of social media posts.\n\u201cThe Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.\nIn reality, the crime rate in the District of Columbia has been falling for two years and is now as low as it has been in decades.\nTrump, though, cited the 2023 crime rate as he held up charts comparing Washington\u2019s crime rates to that of major cities around the world. He also suggested police should use violence as they work if people they arrest try to resist.\n\u201cThey fight back until you knock the hell out of them, because it\u2019s the only language they understand,\u201d he said.\nAuthoritarian experts warn that Trump, who previously deployed both the California National Guard as well as active-duty Marines in Los Angeles, is actually trying to accustom Americans to the idea of having federal troops on the ground in cities \u2014 a foreign concept in this country for most of its history.\nTrump on Monday said that this plan could serve as a model for what he does in other cities around the country.\n\u201cOther cities are hopefully watching this ... Maybe they\u2019ll self clean-up,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to look at New York in a little while ... If we need to, we\u2019re going to do the same thing in Chicago, which is a disaster.\u201d\nTrump also seems fixated on \u201cbeautification\u201d of the Washington, which appears centered on getting homeless people off of the streets.\n\u201cThe Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital,\u201d Trump wrote.\nAs he began his campaign to regain the office he had left in disgrace after his Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt, Trump faced four separate felony indictments \u2014 one federal and one by Georgia prosecutors based on actions leading up to that day; another federal prosecution for his refusal to turn over secret documents he took with him to his Mar-a-Lago country club in South Florida; and a fourth based on his $130,000 hush money payment to adult actor Stormy Daniels days before the 2016 election.\nHe was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records in the hush money case, but the federal prosecutions were dismissed after he won the November election based on the Department of Justice\u2019s longstanding practice not to prosecute a sitting president. The Georgia case was also delayed indefinitely, and the presiding judge in the New York case did not even fine Trump based on his imminent return to the presidency.\nOn the day he took office in 2025, Trump pardoned more than 1,500 of his followers who had been charged, and in many cases convicted, of crimes for their actions on Jan. 6, after Trump told them to march on the Capitol to coerce lawmakers and his own vice president into awarding him a second term even though he had lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden. Some 400 of those had assaulted Capitol and D.C. police officers with their fists, sticks, a baseball bat and other assorted weapons.\nMore than 140 officers were injured that day, some gravely. One died hours later and four others died by suicide in the coming weeks and months.\nNotwithstanding this, however, Trump continues to lie that his supporters did nothing wrong that day.\n\u201cI pardoned people who were assaulted themselves. They were assaulted by our government,\u201d he said during a February mini-news conference aboard Air Force One."

      "text": "Trump orders National Guard into Washington and takes over DC police: Live updates\nPresident Donald Trump said the federal government will take control of the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department.\n- Trump declared a public safety emergency in Washington, D.C., and said the federal government will take over the local police department.\n- The president said he will deploy National Guard troops to fight crime in the capital.\n- Violent crime has fallen 26% in Washington, D.C., from the same period last year, according the Metropolitan Police Department.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump said he will deploy National Guard troops to Washington, DC, as part of an aggressive federal effort to crack down on crime in the nation\u2019s capital.\nTrump said the federal government would also seize control of Washington's Metropolitan Police Department.\n\"We're taking our capital back,\" Trump said August 11. \"We're taking it back.\"\n\"I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\" Trump said. \"This is Liberation Day in DC, and we're going to take our capital back.\"\nWashington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser called the moves \"unsettling and unprecedented.\"\nTrump's actions follow a high-profile assault on a former staffer of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), 19-year-old Edward Coristine, that occured in the early morning hours of Aug. 3. during an attempted carjacking.\nDC mayor: Trump\u2019s police takeover \u201cunsettling and unprecedented\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s move to assert control over Washington D.C.\u2019s police force is \"unsettling and unprecedented\" the city\u2019s mayor said, while also indicating she will cooperate with federal authorities.\nMayor Muriel Bowser disputed Trump\u2019s justification for declaring a crime emergency in D.C, calling it a subjective \u201cso-called emergency\u201d and noting that the crime has been trending down in the city after spiking in 2023.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not experiencing a spike in crime but a decrease in crime,\u201d Bowser said during an Aug. 11 press conference following Trump\u2019s announcement earlier in the day.\nYet she acknowledged Trump\u2019s authority under the Home Rule Act, which gives the federal government certain powers over D.C. governance. Trump cited the law in an executive order declaring he was using emergency powers to seize control of the city\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\u201cThe Home Rule charter requires the mayor to provide the services of MPD during special conditions of an emergency, and we will follow the law,\u201d Bowser.\n-Zac Anderson\nDOJ earlier said DC violent crime was at a 30-year low\nDespite claims of rising crime and violence in Washington by President Trump and his attorney general and FBI chief, the Justice Department itself announced in January that total violent crime for 2024 was down 35% from the year before.\nIn fact, crime in the capital \u201cis the lowest it has been in over 30 years,\u201d according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department included in a Jan. 3 statement by the Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\nThen-U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, credited the declines to a \"focus on the drivers of violence \u2212 those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed.\u201d\nDuring an August 11 press conference, DC was described as one of the most unsafe and violent cities in the world by Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Graves\u2019 recently confirmed replacement, former television personality Jeanine Pirro.\nBut the Justice Department in January said that in addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides were down 32%; robberies were down 39%; armed carjackings were down 53% and assaults with a dangerous weapon were down 27% when compared with 2023 levels. DOJ also said the District was reporting \u201cthe fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\u201d\nIn 2024, Washington, DC,had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit.\n\u2212Josh Meyer\nTrump says on police response to protesters: \u2018You spit and we hit\u2019\nPresident Trump issued a stern warning to protesters in Washington, DC, and beyond during his Aug. 11 press briefing where he announced plans to federalize the city's police force and deploy National Guard troops: \u201cYou spit and we hit.\u201d\nIn making the remark, Trump said that he was aware of a recent incident in Navy Yard, a neighborhood located in southeast DC. Police arrested a minor on Aug. 9 who discharged a firearm at a group of teens, according to ABC 7 News.\nNavy Yard has seen other incidents of violence in the past, including fights breaking out among teens and a 25-year-old arrested and charged with assault on a police officer.\n\u201cThey're not going to be fighting back long,\u201d Trump said,\nApparently recalling previous street protests were officers showed restraint against demonstrators, Trump called on officers to use force.\n\u201cThey love to spit in the face of the police as the police are standing up there in uniform, they're standing and they're screaming at them an inch away from their face, and then they start spitting in their face. And I said you tell them, \u2018You spit and we hit,'\" Trump said. \u201cAnd they can hit real hard. It's a disgusting thing.\"\n\u2212Sudiksha Kochi\n\u2018Political theater,\u2019 says top Democrat\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sharply criticized President Trump\u2019s takeover of the Washington D.C. police department as \u201cpolitical theater,\u201d and said the nation\u2019s capital doesn\u2019t need it because it\u2019s already reducing violent crime.\n\"What the president did this morning was political theater,\u201d said Durbin, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\u201cHis idea of federalizing the police force of D.C. ignores the reality,\u201d Durbin said at a news conference to discuss the Texas state House Democrats who are boycotting a Trump-backed push to redraw congressional districts.\n\u201cThey are making dramatic progress in reducing violent crime in D.C., so it's a typical move by this president to create chaos and uncertainty, and to draw the attention from other issues like Jeffrey Epstein,\" added Durbin, a longtime Democratic leader who that he will retire and not seek reelection in 2026.\n\u2212Josh Meyer\nTrump says he's looking at downgrading marijuana\nPresident Donald Trump said his administration is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\n\"We're looking at reclassification and we'll make a determination over the next few weeks,\" Trump said during his Aug. 11 press conference.\nThough 45 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, the federal government still classifies it as a Schedule I drug.\n-Sarah Wire\nTrump longs for completed White House ballroom\nPresident Trump brought up his plans to build a 90,000-square-foot ballroom in the White House to the overflowing room of journalists packed into his Aug. 11 media briefing.\n\u201cI would've certainly loved to have had it today,\" the president said of the construction project that isn't slated to be completed until 2029. \"We would've filled it up.\"\n\u2212Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\nHegseth to 'work with state governors' to use more National Guard troops\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth is authorized to \"work with state governors\" to use their states' National Guard troops \"if necessary\" to deploy Washington, D.C., according to Will Scharf, an aide to President Donald Trump.\nHegseth got the green light in the presidential memo that Trump signed directing National Guard troops into Washington, Scharf said. For National Guard troops from states other than the District of Columbia to carry out law enforcement actions, they must be deployed with the consent of their states' governor. - Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nTrump signs executive orders driving DC crackdown\nTrump signed two executive orders earlier in the day as part of his federal crackdown on Washington crime, White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf said.\nOne order invoked Section 40 of the Home Rule Act to allow the Trump administration to take control of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department\nSeparately, Trump signed a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy National Guard troops in Washington. He said the memorandum also authorized Hegseth to work with governors of other states to utilize their National Guards as well.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\nTrump: 800 D.C. National Guard troops will be mobilized\nPresident Donald Trump said 800 troops from the Washington, D.C., National Guard will be mobilized. He said more could be tapped to join them.\n\"If necessary we're going to move servicemembers directly to joining the guardsmen,\" he said.\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nTroops will be 'flowing into the streets of Washington'\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Washington, D.C., National Guard was mobilized the morning of August 11 at President Trump's direction.\n\"You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming weeks,\" Hegseth said. Hegseth said other National Guard units and \"specialized units\" stood ready.\n\"They will be strong. They will be tough,\" he said.\n\"We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement to ensure this city is safe, this city is beautiful.\"\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n'It\u2019s embarrassing,' Trump says of DC crime before Putin summit\nAs he announced the federal takeover of Washington, D.C., police, Trump said he didn\u2019t want to be talking the subject days before his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\u201cThis is a tragic emergency. And it's embarrassing for me to be up here,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm gonna see Putin. I'm going to Russia on Friday. I don't like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capitol was with graffiti all over the walls.\u201d\nThe leaders are scheduled to meet on Aug. 15 in Alaska to discuss an end to the three-year Russian war on Ukraine, in the first in-person meeting since Trump took office for his second term.\n\u2212Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\nTrump puts new DEA chief in charge of DC police\nTrump announced that Drug Enforcement Administrator Terrance Cole will take over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be designated as the interim federal commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Department, okay?\u201d Trump told Cole, standing on the stage with him. \u201cAnd you run them tough, they're good. You have a lot of good people.\u201d\nCole was sworn in as DEA administrator on July 23, following his Senate confirmation.\n-Josh Meyer\nTrump declares public safety emergency, says Bondi will take command of DC police\nTrump said he is declaring a public safety emergency in Washington D.C. and announced Attorney General Pam Bondi will take command of the local Metropolitan Police Department.\nTrump said his new DEA administrator Terry Cole will serve as interim federal commissioner of the police department.\nTrump said he will notify Congress and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser about the moves.\n\u201cThis is an emergency. This is a tragic emergency,\u201d Trump said.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump suggests crime crackdown could extend to other US cities\nTrump seemed to suggest he could later pursue federal intervention to combat crime in places like Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to lose our cities over this,\u201d Trump said as he railed against what he called rising crime rates. \u201cAnd this will go further. We\u2019re starting very strongly with D.C., and we\u2019re going to clean it up real quick, very quickly.\u201d\nTrump was flanked by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as he gave his remarks.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\nTrump says he\u2019s deploying National Guard, taking control of police department\nTrump said he is sending National Guard troops to Washington D.C. and placing Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control to crack down on crime in the nation\u2019s capital.\nTrump cited authority under Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to take control of Washington\u2019s police department.\n\u201cThis is liberation day in D.C.,\" Trump said, touting his moves as \u201chistoric action to rescue our nation from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.\u201d\n\u2212Joey Garrison\nSen. Mike Lee: Time to take over DC\nAhead of Trump\u2019s press conference, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said now is the time for Congress to take control of the city.\n\u201cWe should pass the BOWSER Act in September and return full control of Washington to Congress,\u201d Lee said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\nThe legislation, dubbed \u201cBringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident\u201d was introduced earlier this year, and was named after D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser as a criticism of crime and alleged corruption.\nLee cited an ongoing scandal, for example, involving a D.C. police commander who in July was suspended for allegedly changing crime stats in his district. He also noted how in some news reports local residents said they were afraid to speak out about crime for fear of reprisal.\n\u2212Phillip M. Bailey, Deborah Berry\nWhite House says DC\u2019s murder rate leads other national capitals\nAhead of Trump\u2019s press conference, White House officials handed a chart to reporters in the press briefing room detailing how Washington D.C.\u2019s homicide rate is greater than those of several foreign capitals.\nWith about 27 murders per every 100,000 residents, Washington, D.C., has a higher homicide rate than Bogota, Colombia; Mexico City; Islamabad, Pakistan; Lima, Peru; and Ottawa, Canada, among others, according to the chart.\nEven so, violent crime in Washington D.C. is down 26% in 2025 compared to this time last year. In 2024, Washington, D.C., had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit, at 27.3 per 100,000 residents, a decline of 30.7% from 2023.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump's expected troop deployment recalls 2020 protest crackdown\nPresident Trump's expected announcement that he will send the military onto the streets of the nation's capital recalls his deployment of National Guard troops during his first term to suppress protests sparked by the police murder of George Floyd.\nTrump has threatened a massive crackdown on crime in Washington.\nNational Guard troops mobilized by the president in a \"federalized\" capacity are typically barred from carrying out the functions of law enforcement, but not if they're under state control. In the summer of 2020, Trump brought troops into Washington from other states under the permission of 11 governors \u2212 an unprecedented mobilization of state troops.\nTrump's authority to direct National Guard troops was challenged earlier this year after he tapped the California National Guard to quell protests over widespread deportations in the Los Angeles area. After Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Trump's control over the troops, a judge ruled in favor of Trump.\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nDemocrats ask: What about Jan. 6?\nAhead of Trump's press conference, Democrats criticized Trump for failing to call in the National Guard during the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, while preparing to call in the military now to suppress street crime.\nMore than 1,575 people were charged in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection. At least 600 were charged with the felony of assaulting or impeding law enforcement, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\u201cRemember January 6, 2021: Why did Trump fail to call out to DC National Guard? Don\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s lies,\u201d Donna Brazile, former acting chair of the Democratic National Committee, wrote on X.\nWashington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department.\n-Sudiksha Kochi, Josh Meyer and Zac Anderson\nNo DC crime surge, mayor says\nA spokesman for Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser declined to comment ahead of Trump\u2019s news conference.\nBut during an Aug. 10 appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d Bowser pushed back at Trump\u2019s claims of rising crime in Washington. \u201cWe are not experiencing a crime spike,\u201d the mayor said.\nBowser expressed concern about sending the National Guard into the capital, noting that Guard troops are not meant to enforce local laws.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about them not being used efficiently. And I just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our guard,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the president\u2019s call about how to deploy the guard.\u201d\nBowser, who is in her third mayoral term, has refrained from responding with hostility to Trump\u2019s threats about taking over Washington.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n450 federal officers deployed on DC streets\nTrump's announcement comes as 450 officers from multiple federal agencies were deployed in high-traffic D.C. areas and other hotspots over the weekend on Aug. 9 and 10.\nThe officers are from 18 agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Secret Service.\nTrump ordered an increased law enforcement presence in D.C. on Aug. 8 after complaining about crime in the city, even as violent crime trended down.\nViolent crime is down 26% in DC in 2025\nThe White House pointed to several examples of violent crime in Washington this year including the May 21 fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a downtown museum (The suspect is from Chicago.) as well as the recent assault on Coristine.\nYet Washington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department. Violent crime declined by 35% in Washington from 2023 ro 2024, including homicides from 274 to 187.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump threatens to take over DC\nTrump has long denigrated Washington, D.C, which leans heavily Democratic. Last week, Trump threatened to take over governance of the district if the crime situation isn't improved \u2012 something he floated previously in February.\n\"If D.C. doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they\u2019re not going to get away with it anymore,\" Trump said in an Aug. 5 post on Truth Social.\nSuch action would require approval by Congress.\nThe District of Columbia is a federal enclave under jurisdiction of the U.S. government. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 gave the city local governance, including an elected mayor and city council. Two congressional Republicans, Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, this month introduced legislation to repeal the Home Rule Act.\n-Joey Garrison\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

      "text": "I'm glad Trump is focused on nonexistent DC crime wave, not his campaign promises | Opinion\nIt's nice to finally have a president committed to sprucing up our nation's capital, which I have visited one time in my life and will likely never see again.\nAs a Midwestern voter, I\u2019m pleased as punch to see my president, Donald J. Trump, laser-focused on the two issues that concern me most:\n- Crime and cleanliness in Washington, DC.\n- Making sure the White House is covered in fancy gold and has a giant new ballroom for events I will never be invited to attend.\nThings like food prices, wars, health care and manufacturing jobs can wait. It\u2019s nice to finally have a president committed to sprucing up our nation\u2019s capital, which I have visited once in my life and will likely never see again because I\u2019m scared to travel to big cities.\nTrump swears he will stop DC's violent crime wave that doesn't exist\nOn Aug. 11, President Trump held a news conference at the White House announcing his plan to deploy the National Guard to Washington, DC, to stop a crime wave that he is patriotically claiming exists.\n\"I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\" Trump said. \"This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we're going to take our capital back.\"\nOh, thank goodness. While data from the Washington, DC, police department shows violent crime has fallen to it lowest point since before the COVID-19 pandemic, I\u2019m not one to trust numbers. I believe the president\u2019s claim that the capital is a rabid hellscape riddled with homeless encampments and presumably liberal graffiti, and I don\u2019t think the possibility of the federal government taking over the city is in any way an attempt to draw attention away from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.\nI\u2019m sure President Trump will release the Epstein files as soon as he\u2019s finished getting all the murderers out of Washington, adding additional gold trim to various parts of the White House and building a $200 million ballroom that\u2019s also covered in gold.\nI voted for Trump mainly because I wanted more gold in the White House\nWhen I voted for Trump, these were my priorities in order of importance:\n- End crime in our nation\u2019s capital and pardon the Jan. 6 rioters who patriotically attacked the U.S. Capitol in 2021.\n- Clean up our nation\u2019s capital, which has gone to hell in a handbasket since the Jan. 6 rioters left it clean and pristine.\n- Add extensive gold-plated or gold-painted fixtures, carvings and molding to the Oval Office and rooms throughout the White House.\n- Pave over the Rose Garden so it looks like a patio.\n- Add a massive ballroom to the White House, and don\u2019t skimp on the gold!\n- Spend hundreds of millions of dollars rehabbing a flying-palace jet so Trump can use it as a more gold-forward Air Force One.\nI'm sure the Epstein files are coming as soon as DC is crime-free\nI figured once those issues were all addressed, the president could move on to stuff like lowering grocery prices, making health care more affordable, ending the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and releasing the Epstein files.\nSo to all the haters who keep claiming Trump hasn\u2019t come through on any of his promises, how about you shut up. He\u2019s slapping gold up in the White House quicker than you can say \u201cIt looks like Mar-a-Lago threw up in here!\u201d and now he\u2019s tackling problems in the capital that I\u2019m told by him are problems.\nGrocery prices are still high, but Trump has to deal with DC first\nAs Trump wrote on Truth Social on Aug. 10, Sunday: \u201cI will take care of our cherished Capital, and we will make it, truly, GREAT AGAIN! Before the tents, squalor, filth, and Crime, it was the most beautiful Capital in the World. It will soon be that again.\u201d\nPersonally, I\u2019m 100% fine with my family rationing meat and not giving my children milk to drink if it means the \u201ctents, squalor, filth, and Crime\u201d that I have not seen are eradicated from Washington, a place I have no plans to ever visit.\nAnd my concerns about Trump\u2019s involvement with the world\u2019s most notorious sex trafficking case have been completely overridden by the thrill of seeing a White House slathered in excessive gold trim.\nBetter health care and an end to wars can wait until the White House\u2019s grand new ballroom is up and President Trump proudly soars over it in his flying palace.\nThis is exactly what I voted for, and I couldn\u2019t be happier.

      "text": "Trump's mental decline is on vivid display as he rages about Epstein, windmills | Opinion\nHe went on lengthy diatribes about windmills. He ranted about the ungratefulness of starving children. He forayed into nonsensical conspiracy theories regarding the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.\nIt was nice of Donald Trump to travel to Scotland and show our European allies firsthand that the United States is led by a self-absorbed and deeply weird man in obvious mental decline.\nOver the span of a weekend, the U.S. president\u2019s addled brain raced about like a dull-witted Labrador attempting to outsmart squirrels. He went on lengthy diatribes about windmills. He ranted about the ungratefulness of starving children. He forayed into nonsensical conspiracy theories regarding the Jeffrey Epstein scandal consuming his administration, while laughably saying upon arriving in Scotland on July 25: \u201cI\u2019m not focused on conspiracy theories.\u201d\nTrump's head, based on his overseas babbling, is 90% conspiracy theories and 10% brain cells.\nCoverage of Trump's Scotland trip doesn't show the extent of his rambling\nThe trip was largely a taxpayer-funded chance for the grifter in chief to promote his Scottish golf properties, which in the realm of \u201cthings Trump can do that no other president would ever get away with\u201d barely registers as a blip.\nIt was also a chance for him to talk \u201cdeals\u201d with the European Union and the United Kingdom, with a \u201cdeal\u201d being something resulting in trade tariffs that will negatively impact American consumers.\nOr as Trump likes to call it, \u201cWinning.\u201d\nNews coverage tends to trim Trump\u2019s voluminous prattling into digestible sound bites that sound vaguely sane. But if we care about a president\u2019s lack of mental acuity \u2013 and I\u2019ve been told by many that we do \u2013 it\u2019s worth sticking your head in the high-pressure stream of nonsense that shoots out every time Trump opens his face hole.\nTrump shows he's laser-focused on the scourge of windmills\nOn July 25, Trump deplaned in Scotland and immediately showed reporters he was armed with weapons-grade non sequiturs.\n\u201cThis immigration is killing Europe,\u201d he said, racistly. \u201cAnd the other thing, stop the windmills killing the beauty of your countries.\u201d\nTwo days later, he sat with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who looked like she would love to be elsewhere, and uncorked this: \u201cAnd the other thing I say to Europe, we will not allow a windmill to be built in the United States, they\u2019re killing us. They\u2019re killing the beauty of our scenery, our valleys, our beautiful plains. And I\u2019m not talking about airplanes, I\u2019m talking about beautiful plains, beautiful areas of the United States, and you look up and you see windmills all over the place, it\u2019s a horrible thing. It's the most expensive form of energy; it\u2019s no good. They\u2019re made in China, almost all of them. When they start to rust and rot in eight years, you can\u2019t really turn them off, you can\u2019t bury them, they won't let you. But the propellers, the props, because they\u2019re a certain type of fiber that doesn\u2019t go well with the land, that\u2019s what they say. The environmentalists say you can\u2019t bury them because the fiber doesn\u2019t go well with the land; in other words, if you bury it, it will harm our soil. The whole thing is a con job.\u201d\nOK. That was a thing nobody asked for. It\u2019s also filled with lies \u2013 wind isn\u2019t the most expensive form of energy, and windmills last far longer than eight years. But who would expect honesty from someone rambling like that?\nAgain with the windmills? Heck, just let the old man cook.\nAnd Trump wasn\u2019t done with windmills. On July 28, during his meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the president said: \u201cIt destroys the beauty of your fields, your plains, and your waterways, and look out there \u2013 there's no windmills. But if you look in another direction, you see windmills.\u201d\nAre the windmills in the room with us right now, Mr. President?\nPropose prosecuting Beyonc\u00e9? Check! Babble incoherently? Check!\nTrump did take a break from talking crazy over the weekend to post something crazy on social media, writing July 26 that pop star Beyonc\u00e9 should be prosecuted for a nonexistent $11 million payment from Kamala Harris\u2019 presidential campaign.\nSo that happened. And it\u2019s not ideal.\nOn July 27, alongside von der Leyen, Trump was asked how he feels about the images of starving children in Gaza, to which he said: \u201cThat whole place is a mess. The Gaza Strip, you know, was given many years ago, said that they could have peace. That didn\u2019t work out too well. When Israel gave that up, whoever was the prime minister at the time, who I know, who it was, but it was not exactly a very clever thing to do. Because that was given so that they finally have peace, but it\u2019s actually made the situation worse. But we\u2019ll see what happens. I think Iran is acting up. We have a lot of people acting, we have Venezuela acting up in a different way. They continue to send people that we rebuff to our border. They continue to send drugs into our country, Venezuela. They\u2019ve been very nasty.\u201d\nSo when shown images of starving children in Gaza, Trump feels the place is a mess because an Israeli prime minister whose name he DEFINITELY knows but isn\u2019t going to say gave up the Gaza Strip so there could be peace but that made things worse and Iran is acting up and, hey, let me tell you about Venezuela, which is about 7,000 miles away from Gaza.\nRepublicans would have impeached Biden if he talked like Trump\nHad Joe Biden said something like that when he was president, Republicans would have either impeached him or ordered him locked in a room at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\nIt got worse when Trump was asked if Israel should be doing more to allow food into Gaza to help the aforementioned starving children. The president\u2019s few remaining brain cells decided to focus on how ungrateful all those starving people are: \u201cWe gave $60 million two weeks ago, and nobody even acknowledged it, for food. It\u2019s terrible, you know, you really at least want to have somebody say thank you. No other country gave anything; we gave $60 million two weeks ago for food for Gaza. Nobody acknowledged it, nobody talks about it. And it makes you feel a little bad when you do that, and you have other countries not giving anything, none of the European countries, by the way, nobody gave but us, and nobody said, \u2018Gee, thank you very much,\u2019 and it would be nice to have at least a thank you.\u201d\nDuring his meeting with Starmer, Trump apparently forgot he had been talking about the Gaza Strip the day before and said: \u201cWe do have to take care of the humanitarian needs on what they used to call the Gaza Strip. You don't hear that line too much anymore. You don't hear the Gaza Strip. But it is the Gaza Strip. Amazing.\u201d\nYes. Amazing.\nEpstein, Epstein, Epstein. Trump can't stop talking about the scandal.\nTrump\u2019s mental dullness led him to keep talking about the Epstein scandal he wants everyone to stop talking about, effectively telling the world the Epstein stuff is \u201cnot a big thing,\u201d but probably involves former Democratic President Bill Clinton and a former president of Harvard University and \u201chedge fund guys\u201d and was probably made up by Democrats who probably put fake stuff in the Epstein files but then, I guess, didn\u2019t use any damning information against Trump before the election.\nHe also gave a third explanation for why he stopped being friends with Epstein and said of the convicted sex offender\u2019s notorious island: \u201cI never had the privilege of going to his island.\u201d\nThe privilege? Spoken like a man whose mind has turned to mush.\nSo nice of Trump to share his cognitive decline with the world.\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke on Bluesky at @rexhuppke.bsky.social and on Facebook at facebook.com/RexIsAJerk"

      "text": "President Donald Trump claimed he is going to Russia to meet with leader Vladimir Putin on Friday\u2014but he is actually going to Alaska.\nTrump told reporters last week he would be meeting with Putin in Alaska on Friday to discuss an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, but during a press briefing on Monday, he repeatedly claimed he was visiting Russia instead.\n\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing. You know, I\u2019m going to see Putin. I\u2019m going to Russia on Friday,\" he said during a briefing announcing a federal takeover of Washington, D.C. \" I don\u2019t like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capital was with graffiti all over the walls.\"\nHe repeated the claim for the second time later on during the press conference.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to Russia. It\u2019s going to be a big deal,\u201d he said.\nTrump was immediately mocked for his flub on social media.\nPolitical commentator Aaron Parnas quipped on social media platform X: \u201cAre we giving Alaska back?\u201d\nMeidasTouch simply responded to Trump\u2019s claim with question marks. Meanwhile, the PatriotTakes account questioned whether the president was calling the U.S. state \u201cRussia\u201d instead of Alaska.\nU.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) also jabbed Trump over his claim.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to Russia? This doddering old man has no idea where he is or what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Swalwell wrote on X.\nAnd journalist Jimmy Rushton questioned whether the meeting between Trump and Putin has been relocated.\n\u201cWait a second; has the Trump-Putin summit location been rearranged or has the Trump administration just announced they\u2019ve ceded Alaska to Russia?\u201d he wrote on X.\nTrump said last week his meeting with Putin would come before any sit-down discussion involving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump also previously agreed to meet with Putin even if the Russian leader would not meet with Zelenskyy. That stoked fears in Europe that Ukraine could be sidelined in efforts to stop the continent\u2019s biggest conflict since World War II.\nTrump\u2019s announcement that he planned to host one of America\u2019s adversaries on U.S. soil broke with expectations that they\u2019d meet in a third country. The gesture gives Putin validation after the U.S. and its allies had long sought to make him a pariah over his war against Ukraine.\nEarly in Putin\u2019s tenure, he regularly met with his U.S. counterparts. That dropped off and the tone became icier as tensions mounted between Russia and the West after Moscow illegally annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and faced allegations of meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections.\nPutin\u2019s last visit to the U.S. was in 2015, when he attended the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York. The meeting in Alaska would be the first U.S.-Russia summit since 2021, when former President Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nStories by Lauren Sforza\nOur journalism needs your support.

      "text": "President Donald Trump called D.C. crime \u201cridiculous\u201d in remarks Wednesday in the Oval Office. He threatened to federalize the police department and even bring in National Guard troops.\nBut Metropolitan Police Department data shows crime in D.C. is down. Violent crime dropped 26% this year so far, compared to the same period last year. Homicide dropped 12% and assaults with a dangerous weapon dropped 20%. These include non-fatal shootings and stabbings.\nStream NBC4 newscasts for free right here, right now.\nCarjackings are down 37%. Two summers ago, D.C. saw a spike, with about five carjackings every day in June 2023. This June, it was about one per day. Half the people arrested in D.C. for carjacking this year are juveniles.\nWe have the news you need to know to start your day. Sign up for the First & 4Most morning newsletter \u2014 delivered to your inbox daily.\nU.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro highlighted youth crime in remarks on Thursday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing far too much crime being committed by young people \u2013 14, 15, 16, 17 years old \u2013 that I can\u2019t get my hands on. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen some of these pictures. But young people are coddled, and they don\u2019t need to be coddled anymore. They need to be held accountable,\u201d she said.\nAccording to D.C. statistics, more juveniles have been arrested in D.C. this year through the end of June, at about 1% more than the same time last year.\nWithout changing D.C. laws, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office can prosecute 16 and 17-year-olds solely by its choice for the most serious crimes, including murder, rape and armed robbery. Other crimes can be moved to adult court after a hearing.\nFifteen-year-olds can be prosecuted as adults in D.C. if a judge determines they cannot be rehabilitated by the juvenile system; those 14 and younger cannot.\nIn a letter to the D.C. Council on Wednesday, Pirro asked council members to reconsider three D.C. laws that she called detrimental to public safety: the Second Chance Act, the Second Look Act and the Youth Rehabilitation Act. Only the third law would directly affect current juvenile cases by possibly increasing sentences for young people. The others deal with changes after sentences are imposed."

      "text": "In the wake of Trump's federal DC takeover, are you worried about crime? Tell us. | Opinion\nTrump's drastic moves in DC, including sending in the National Guard, follow the assault on an ex-DOGE staffer. But official numbers say the capital is safer. How do you feel about crime in your town?\nWashington, DC, is awash in \"crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\" our nation's president told us Monday, Aug. 11.\nTo save it, President Donald Trump said he is taking over the city's police department, sending in 800 National Guard troops and removing homeless people. The extreme executive actions came a week after a 19-year-old former staffer of the Department of Government Efficiency was assaulted in Washington during an attempted carjacking, after which Trump threatened to federalize the city.\nThe thing is, despite the high-profile assault, violent crime in the nation's capital is the lowest in more than 30 years.\nTrump is not alone in his disconnect. In nearly three decades of polls, most of us continued to say crime was increasing in the United States. But it hasn't.\nViolent crime has dropped by nearly half since 1993, while property crime has fallen even more, according to the FBI.\nAre you concerned about crime where you live?\nWhile we are safer overall, that's not to say there aren't outliers \u2013 cities or neighborhoods where crime is worse. The situation can be very localized. It can also be very personal, sometimes tragically so for victims. That's why we're turning to you, our readers. We're asking you to answer this poll about your perceptions and experiences regarding crime. What is your understanding of safety in your community and the country?\nFill out our form below or send us an email to forum@usatoday.com with the subject line \"Forum Crime.\" We'll pick a collection of responses to share in a follow-up post.\nTo help you respond, here are some questions you can answer:\n- Do you agree with Trump's actions in Washington, DC, that he says will reduce crime, including taking over the police force, bringing in the National Guard and forcing out homeless people?\n- If you agree, why do you think they will work?\n- If you disagree, why do you think they will not?\n- Do you feel safe in your hometown? Why or why not?\n- Do you think crime has gone down or gone up where you live? Why or why not?\nJoel Burgess is a Voices editor for the USA TODAY Network."

  "argos_summary": "President Trump mistakenly claimed he was meeting with Vladimir Putin in Russia, when the meeting is actually scheduled for Alaska. During a press conference, he announced the deployment of National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to address a non-existent crime wave, despite data showing that violent crime in the city has significantly decreased. Trump's incoherent responses to questions raised concerns about his mental acuity, drawing comparisons to past gaffes made by President Biden.",
