  "title": "Why Guinea Pigs Might Be the Best Pet You\u2019ve Never Considered",
  "description": "Discover the essentials of guinea pig care, including their history, diet, environment, and why they make such beloved pets.",
  "content": "First things first: the guinea pig is not a pig and it\u2019s not from Guinea. Now that we\u2019ve cleared that up, let\u2019s talk about what these charming rodents, also called cavies, actually are. Their scientific name is Cavia porcellus, and all domestic guinea pigs today are descended from wild ancestors in South America. While they are closely related to wild cavies like the Montane guinea pig, thousands of years of domestication have made them the gentle pets we know.\n\nTheir story began in the Andes Mountains where they were originally domesticated by humans for food and cultural rituals. Spanish explorers later brought them to Europe where they charmed even Queen Elizabeth. The name remains a puzzle; some think guinea referred to a faraway land, but it has no connection to West Africa.\n\nFrom Wild Cavy to Beloved Pet: The History of Guinea Pigs\n\nThe journey from the wild to our homes was a long one. Through selective breeding, countless color variations and coat types have emerged, from sleek black guinea pigs to fluffy long-haired varieties. Today, there are many breeds recognized by groups like the American Cavy Breeders Association. While they make great pets, these animals have also been used as popular laboratory animals due to their docile nature.\n\nAll the domesticated guinea pigs we see today are members of the species Cavia porcellus, a distinct branch of the family Caviidae that no longer exists in the wild. Their wilder cousins, like the Greater guinea pig or the Sul guinea pig, still roam various regions, from the Amazon River Basin to moist savannas in places like northwestern Argentina.\n\nGuinea Pig Diet and Nutrition: What\u2019s on the Menu?\n\nGuinea pigs are strict herbivores and their diet is the foundation of their health. A huge portion of their day is spent time eating. The pyramid of their food is built on an endless supply of high-quality hay. Grass hays like timothy hay are non-negotiable. They keep a cavy\u2019s digestive system moving and wear down their constantly growing teeth.\n\nHere\u2019s a crucial fact: unlike other mammals, guinea pigs can\u2019t make their own vitamin C, so they must get it from their food every single day to get enough vitamin C. This is where vitamin C-fortified pellets and fresh vegetables come in. Veggies like red peppers, kale, broccoli and parsley are fantastic sources.\n\nA happy cavy starts with a great home. Forget those tiny pet store cages; guinea pigs need room to roam. A single piggy needs an enclosure that\u2019s at least 30 by 48 inches and you\u2019ll need even more space for a pair. The floor must be solid as wire mesh can seriously injure their delicate feet.\n\nTheir habitat should include hiding houses, tunnels and other spots to retreat. This helps them feel secure. Guinea pigs are also sensitive to temperature and do best between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit so keep their home out of direct sunlight and away from drafts.\n\nGuinea Pig Health and Lifespan: What Owners Should Know\n\nGood care is the best medicine. The right diet and housing help guinea pig owners sidestep common health woes. Finding a vet who specializes in exotic pets would also be a wise decision. A healthy domestic guinea is an expressive one. Male guinea pigs are called boars and female guinea pigs are called sows. Their babies are called pups.\n\nThe gestation period for sows is about nine weeks, and pups are born fully developed. They can run and even eat solid food within hours. They are incredibly social animals, and it\u2019s important to remember a single guinea pig is an unhappy one. They thrive with the companionship of other guinea pigs and should never live alone.\n\nThat famous \u201cwheek\u201d is a sound you\u2019ll get to know well. It\u2019s a loud, high-pitched whistle that\u2019s pure excitement and anticipation. This is a sound guinea pigs almost exclusively direct at their humans, essentially as a way of saying, \u201cHurry up with the food!\u201d Pet owners often hear it the moment they open the fridge, rustle a plastic bag, or even just walk into the room at feeding time. It\u2019s a learned behavior and one of the clearest ways they communicate a happy demand for a treat.\n\nBeing a great pet owner is about more than just filling a food bowl. Here are the absolute must-dos to keep your pet happy and comfortable:\n\u2022 Provide a spacious solid-bottom cage with plenty of room to explore and safe comfy bedding that\u2019s cleaned regularly.\n\u2022 Offer unlimited access to high-quality grass hay as the cornerstone of their diet.\n\u2022 Make sure your guinea pig gets a daily dose of Vitamin C through fortified pellets and a small serving of fresh vitamin-rich vegetables.\n\u2022 Keep them in pairs or groups of the same sex. No one guinea should ever live alone.\n\u2022 Handle them gently and often to build trust and strengthen your bond.\n\u2022 Provide safe chew toys like cardboard tubes and untreated wood blocks for mental stimulation and dental health.\n\nThese social smart and vocal little animals have a rich history and a huge capacity for companionship. A guinea pig will reward you with years of popcorning, happy wheeks and a whole lot of personality if you\u2019re ready to meet their needs.",

      "text": "Bare is Beautiful: 5 Great Hairless Dog Breeds\n- Share via\nAt first the idea seemed crazy, the thought of owning a hairless dog. Dogs are furry and fluffy creatures, you told yourself, made for petting and nuzzling into their soft and luscious coats. And yet you couldn\u2019t stop thinking about them when you\u2019d see one out in public. Maybe you\u2019re here now doing some research. You\u2019re - gasp - seriously considering getting a hairless dog.\nFor some it\u2019s an opportunity to go against the grain and stand out in a crowd of dog owners. Many times they\u2019re sought after people who want a pet but can\u2019t stand dog hair everywhere. Some people have allergies, but aren\u2019t able to own some of the larger hypo-allergenic breeds. With bare skin instead of a furry coat, these pups have a one-of-a-kind look, they barely shed, and you don\u2019t have to clean up after them nearly as much as you would with a dog that has a double coat or long hair.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nSkin Care Over Grooming: A Different Kind of Maintenance\nBecause they\u2019ve got bare skin, hairless dogs need a little extra TLC. Dogs with longer hair or thick fur require grooming to prevent mats, while hairless breeds need moisturizing skincare to avoid breakouts or dry patches. Additionally, they need to be protected from easy sunburn when outdoors in the sun for even very short periods of time. Some hairless dog breeds may also be prone to dental problems or autoimmune conditions. Regular check-ups with vets are just as important for these breeds as with any other.\nFamous Hairless Breeds and Their Personalities\nBeyond the maintenance these dogs are just as affectionate, loyal and fun as any other. There are some pretty famous hairless breeds and they\u2019re not all the same. Each one has a pretty unique set of standard personality traits that are important to consider if you\u2019re thinking of adding a hairless dog to your family.\nThe Xoloitzcuintli: Mexico\u2019s Ancient Treasure\nThe Mexican Hairless Dog, or Xoloitzcuintli, is one of the oldest dog breeds in the Americas making it a true historical treasure. This hairless breed comes in three sizes. Though there is also has a coated variety, though the completely hairless type is more common. Known for their intelligence and calm nature, Xolos make excellent watchdogs and loyal family pets. Their bare skin is warm to the touch and they require regular baths to keep it healthy. Their dignified presence and even temperament make them a great fit for households looking for a calm, low-maintenance pet that is also a faithful guardian.\nThe American Hairless Terrier: Energetic and Obedient\nThe American Hairless Terrier, a relative of the Rat Terrier, is an energetic, playful and intelligent dog with little to no hair or fur. It\u2019s one of the only hairless dog breeds native to the United States and is becoming increasingly popular among allergy sufferers. Most have bare skin, though some are born with a short coat. They are known for their strong prey drive and excel in agility and obedience training, making them a great fit for active families. Their skin needs consistent care to prevent dryness and irritation. Protective clothing may be needed during colder months to keep their body temperature stable.\nThe Peruvian Inca Orchid: Elegant and Rare\nThe Peruvian Inca Orchid is a graceful, intelligent and affectionate dog. It comes in both coated and hairless forms. They have a refined, athletic build and move with elegance making them a beautiful sight to behold. They form deep bonds with their owners and require moderate exercise to remain content. They are a relatively rare breed and not as commonly seen as other pups. But they are treasured by those who appreciate their history and unique companionship.\nThe Ecuadorian Hairless Dog: A Playful Rarity\nThe Ecuadorian Hairless Dog is an exceptionally rare breed, closely related to other South American hairless dogs like the Peruvian Inca Orchid. It has completely hairless or very short coat varieties and is known for its playful and gentle nature. Their active nature and affectionate demeanor make them great companions for experienced pet parents who can manage their exercise and grooming needs. In addition to regular baths and moisturizer, they can benefit from the occasional light exfoliation. These dogs are high-energy, needing regular physical and mental stimulation.\nThe Chinese Crested: Iconic and Adaptable\nThe Chinese Crested is one of the most recognizable hairless dog breeds. It comes in two varieties: hairless and \u201cpowderpuff,\u201d which has a soft coat. The hairless type is the one you probably picture in your head when you think hairless dog. They usually have tufts of hair on their head, tail and feet, which gives them that iconic look they are so well known for. They\u2019re affectionate and highly adaptable so they\u2019re a great fit for apartment living. Despite their delicate appearance they\u2019re actually quite lively and full of personality. They are ideal for attentive pet parents who want a low-shedding companion with a big personality.\nA Hairless Dog May Be the Right Choice for You\nAlthough their lack of hair can be quite a jarring sight, living with a hairless dog can be a great experience for many reasons. These breeds form deep emotional bonds with their owners and are known for their loyalty and warmth (both emotional and literal). With no hair or fur to shed your home will stay cleaner, though of course your time spent on skincare will increase. Whether you choose the sleek Peruvian Inca, the elegant Chinese Crested or the lively American Hairless Terrier, remember that proper care will help your dog thrive so that the sailing will be...well, smooth of course!"

      "text": "Pet Adoption 101: Steps, Costs, and Tips for a Smooth Transition\n- Share via\nAdopting a dog is a rewarding experience that offers a second chance to a deserving animal while bringing joy, companionship, and unconditional love into your life. Whether you\u2019re looking to adopt a pet for the first time or add a new animal to a household with resident pets, understanding the adoption process is important to making a smooth transition and finding the right pet for your family.\nThe decision to adopt a pet doesn\u2019t just help the adopted animal. It also opens space and resources at your local animal shelter, humane society, or adoption center to help more pets in need.\nFrom completing the adoption application to signing the final adoption contract, here\u2019s everything potential adopters should know about how to adopt a pet responsibly.\nThe Adoption Process: A Step-by-Step Guide\nBefore you begin your adoption journey, take time to reflect on your lifestyle, home environment and ability to provide proper care for a dog or cat. Responsible pet ownership means being honest about how much time, energy, and resources you can commit to your new pet, whether you\u2019re considering adult dogs, puppies, adult cats, or even rabbits and guinea pigs.\nThe adoption process often begins with an adoption consultation. During this step an adoption counselor will discuss your needs, lifestyle and experience with pets to help identify a good match. Be open and honest. It helps them match you with the perfect pet based on your family dynamics, home setup and other factors.\nMaking Sense of the the Paperwork and Fees\nAfter the consultation you\u2019ll fill out an adoption application. This form collects details about your daily routine, household members and any other pets in the home. Some shelters work on a first come, first served basis.\nMost shelters charge an adoption fee which typically includes:\n- Neuter surgery or spay\n- Initial vaccinations\n- Microchipping\n- Basic health checks and preventive care\nThe adoption fee may vary depending on the animal\u2019s age, breed and the services provided. Some adoption centers offer reduced or waived fees for adult dogs or during special events. Always ask what\u2019s included and if there are any additional costs post-adoption.\nInterviewing Your Potential Pet for Adoption\nNext comes the most exciting part where you get to meet your potential new pet. Whether the dog or cat is currently in the shelter or in foster care,a meet and greet gives you the chance to interact and see if it\u2019s a good match. Ask the adoption team for the pet\u2019s profile, which usually includes the animal\u2019s age, breed, known health conditions and any history of behavioral problems.\nIf the adopted pet has lived in a foster home, ask about their behavior in that environment. Ask how they interact with other pets, family members and in daily routines. Don\u2019t be afraid to take your time.\nBringing home the right animal is more important than rushing the process.\nWhat You Need to Know about Home Checks\nMany shelters and rescues also require home checks for both dogs and cats. This process isn\u2019t meant to be intimidating. It\u2019s a way for the shelter to make sure the animal is going to a safe environment and that the family is prepared for their new pet.\nFor dogs a home check might focus on things like: Is your yard securely fenced, and is the fence high enough to keep the dog from escaping? Are there any obvious dangers, both inside and outside, that the dog could get into? Do you have a plan for where the dog will eat, sleep and be kept when you\u2019re away?\nFor a cat the check might be more focused on making sure windows have secure screens and that there are no obvious indoor hazards.\nThe home check gives the adoption team a chance to offer suggestions to make the transition as smooth as possible for both you and your new furry friend.\nFinalizing the Pet Adoption Process\nOnce you\u2019ve found your match the next steps include:\n- Provide valid identification such as a government issued identification (like a driver\u2019s license)\n- Pay the adoption fee\n- Sign the adoption contract\n- Some shelters may request references or conduct a home visit to ensure a safe, supportive environment for your adopted pet.\nOnce approved, you\u2019ll receive an adoption packet containing:\n- Medical records\n- Spay/neuter documentation\n- Vaccination history\n- Post-adoption care guidelines\nSome organizations also include helpful information about local veterinarians, trainers or support services.\nStarting Off on the Right Foot with Your Newly Adopted Pet\nAfter the paperwork is complete it\u2019s time to bring your adopted pet to their forever home. The first few days or weeks may involve adjustment. Be patient and offer your new dog consistency, love and structure. If challenges arise don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the adoption team for advice.\nStay in touch with the adoption center and consider attending training sessions or follow-up check-ins. Giving back through donations or volunteering can also help continue to support homeless pets still waiting for their second chance.\nIn choosing to adopt, you\u2019ve not only gained a furry friend, but you\u2019ve become part of a compassionate community that\u2019s helping change the lives of dogs and cats across the country.\nFinding Your New Pal: The Best Places to Start Your Search\nAre you wondering where to begin your adoption journey? There are several trusted websites that connect potential adopters with available pets from animal shelters, rescues, and humane societies across the country. These platforms make it easy to filter by location, breed, age, and even energy level.\nHere are some of the most popular and reputable pet adoption websites:\nPetfinder\nOne of the largest adoption platforms, Petfinder allows you to search thousands of dogs, cats, and other adoptable animals from shelters and rescues nationwide. You can filter by size, age, and behavior traits.\nAdopt-a-Pet\nThis nonprofit platform partners with over 17,000 shelters and rescues across North America. It\u2019s especially user-friendly and allows you to set alerts when pets that match your preferences are listed.\nAKC Rescue Network\nIf you\u2019re looking for a specific dog breed, this network of breed-specific rescues across the U.S. offers a reliable route to adopt a dog responsibly.\nwww.akc.org/akc-rescue-network\nRescue Me!\nThis global network includes dogs, cats and other pets. They let you search by breed and location. It also includes state-by-state rescue groups.\nBest Friends Animal Society\nKnown for its no-kill mission, Best Friends operates its own sanctuaries and rescue centers, while also partnering with a nationwide network of shelters to list adoptable pets.\nThese websites are a great starting point for finding adoptable animals and understanding the adoption process at shelters near you. Most listings include a pet\u2019s profile, photos and details like the animal\u2019s age, temperament and whether they\u2019re in a foster home or at a facility.\nAdoption FAQs: Fast Facts for New Pet Parents\nHow long does it take to adopt a pet?\nThe timeline varies. Some walk-ins can adopt same-day while others may go through a two-week period for screening or preparation.\nWhat does the adoption fee include?\nThe adoption fee usually covers vetting services such as neuter surgery, vaccines and microchipping.\nCan I adopt if I already have other pets?\nYes! Be sure to disclose all resident pets on your application. The adoption team can offer tips on introducing your new pet to other animals.\nWhat are the adoption requirements?\nMost shelters require a government issued photo ID, proof of address and a completed adoption application.\nWhat support is available post-adoption?\nMany shelters offer follow-up advice, behavioral consultations, or referrals to training and veterinary care."

Dog lovers leaned toward Bella, Rosie, Cooper and Sadie, while cat parents went for Oliver, Milo, Leo and Cleo alongside classics like Pepper, Coco and Shadow. A lot of \u201chuman\u201d names made the cat list too, which feels right since cats do seem to demand a little extra formality.\nRegional and City Highlights\nWhere you live clearly matters.

      "text": "Montane guinea pig\n| Montane guinea pig | |\n|---|---|\n| Scientific classification | |\n| Kingdom: | Animalia |\n| Phylum: | Chordata |\n| Class: | Mammalia |\n| Order: | Rodentia |\n| Family: | Caviidae |\n| Genus: | Cavia |\n| Species: | C. tschudii\n|\n| Binomial name | |\n| Cavia tschudii |\nThe montane guinea pig (Cavia tschudii) is a species of caviid rodent found in the Andes in South America. The montane guinea pig is the likely main ancestor of Cavia porcellus, the domestic guinea pig or domestic cavy, which appears to be a hybrid that includes lesser genetic contributions from other Cavia species.[3]\nTaxonomy\n[edit]Peruvian wild guinea pigs were first described by E. T. Bennett in 1835, who termed them Cavia cutleri. J. J. Tschudi, in an 1845 publication, used the term Cavia cutleri to refer to what are now considered two separate species: The first, Bennett's Cavia cutleri, which was later identified (by O. Thomas in 1917) as probably a differently-pigmented version of Cavia porcellus, and the second, a wild Peruvian guinea pig that was clearly different from the animal Bennett described.[3] In 1867,[2] L. Fitzinger renamed the clearly wild guinea pig Cavia tschudii.[3]\nDescription\n[edit]The montane guinea pig is a medium-sized species, growing to a total length of 247 mm (9.7 in). Their colour varies in different parts of the range; in Peru, the dorsal fur is dark reddish-brown mixed with black, and the underparts are dark buffy-grey; in Chile, the dorsal surface is pale agouti brown with paler underparts; in Bolivia, the upper parts are agouti olive and the underparts creamy-white or white.[4][5]\nDistribution and habitat\n[edit]The montane guinea pig is native to the high Andes in South America. Its range extends from Peru southward to the Tarapac\u00e1 Region of Chile and the Tucum\u00e1n Province of Argentina. Its altitude range is 2,000 to 3,800 metres (6,600 to 12,500 ft) above sea level. It lives in moist habitats with rocks and coarse vegetation, making runways through the foliage. In Argentina it lives in burrows with several entrances.[4]\nLifecycle\n[edit]The montane guinea pig has a gestation period around 63 days. Litter size ranges from one to four, and the young grow quickly, becoming independent at 2 months of age.[4]\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Dunnum, J.; Teta, P. (2016). \"Cavia tschudii\".

      "text": "What To Do (and Not Do) When Feral Cats Move Into Your Neighborhood\n- Share via\nThey dart across backyards. Slip under fences. Appear in alleys and vanish before you blink. Feral cats are everywhere. Some neighbors feed them, others complain. But either way the sheer numbers are impossible to ignore.\nWhat\u2019s a Feral Cat, Anyway?\nFirst off, not every outdoor cat is the same. There\u2019s a big difference between a stray and a feral cat, and that distinction matters. A stray cat once had a home; they\u2019re just lost. You can often win them over with some food and a little patience.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nA feral cat is a different kind of wild thing. They were born outdoors. They grew up without any human interaction. You won\u2019t find them meowing at your doorstep or curling up on your couch; they\u2019ll avoid eye contact and keep their distance. Treating them the same as a stray only leads to a misunderstanding of how to help.\nThe numbers are genuinely jaw-dropping. Experts estimate there could be anywhere from 60 to 100 million feral and stray cats in the U.S. alone. Even conservative estimates put it at over 30 million. That\u2019s more than the population of many countries!\nSo why are there so many? For one, cats breed incredibly fast. A single female can have up to three litters a year. Abandoned pets often join existing feral colonies and the cycle just keeps repeating.\nThe impact goes far beyond our neighborhoods, too. Outdoor cats are estimated to kill more than 2 billion birds every year in the U.S., not to mention countless small mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. It\u2019s a conservation issue we can\u2019t afford to ignore.\nA Matter of Health: Risks to Cats and Community\nLife for a feral cat is rough and it\u2019s short. They face constant risks and are susceptible to diseases like feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus. These are big threats to other cats though not so much to people.\nParasites are another story, though. Fleas, ticks, and worms are all common, as is a parasite called Toxoplasmosis, which can spread to humans (most healthy adults don\u2019t even notice symptoms).\nThe disease that gets the most attention, though, is rabies. While it\u2019s rare, cats are the domestic animal most often reported with rabies in the U.S. All of this to say: it\u2019s a very bad idea to try and pick up a feral cat.\nYou\u2019ve Spotted a Colony, Now What?\nThis is a job for the pros. Don\u2019t chase them. Don\u2019t try to touch them. And unless you know exactly what you\u2019re doing, please do not even feed them. A random pile of kibble can attract raccoons, coyotes, and rats, creating a host of new problems. The better move is to contact a local rescue or a feral cat program.\nMost communities have Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) volunteers already working in the area. They\u2019ll know if a colony is being managed. Avoid calling animal control unless there is a true emergency. Most shelters cannot house feral cats and they are often euthanized as a result.\nTrap-Neuter-Return: The Proven Approach\nTNR is the most humane and effective solution. The process is simple: trap the cats humanely, get them fixed and vaccinated. Then release them back where they were found. To make sure they aren\u2019t trapped twice, they get a small ear tip so people can see they\u2019ve already been handled.\nThe payoff is huge. The endless cycle of kittens stops, the overall population stabilizes, and social problems like fighting and spraying drop. The science backs this up: an 11-year TNR program at the University of Central Florida cut the campus cat colony by 66 percent, with no new kittens after year four.\nThe critics counter that it only works if a majority of the colony is sterilized and if new cats don\u2019t move in. Still, TNR is far more effective and humane than trap-and-kill methods.\nA Community of Care: Building Safe Havens for Feral Cats\nTNR is the strategy and shelter is the support. Outdoor cats need a dry and insulated place to hide from harsh weather. An easy option to make at home is a plastic bin with a hole cut in it, lined with straw. Avoid blankets. They soak up water and can make the cats colder.\nWooden shelters also work well, especially if they\u2019re raised off the ground to keep dry. It\u2019s best to place them in quiet corners, away from roads and busy areas. If you do decide to provide a feeding station just be consistent. Cats rely on routine, plus random food piles only attract pests.\nA Path Forward for Feral Cats\nFeral cats aren\u2019t lost pets. They\u2019re a direct result of human neglect and abandonment with biology running unchecked. While the problem isn\u2019t easy to solve, it\u2019s also not hopeless. Communities that embrace TNR, build shelters, and support local rescues see real progress.\nYou don\u2019t have to be the person setting traps or building houses, either. Donating to a local program or simply spreading awareness helps just as much. Feral cats will probably always be here\u2014in alleys, in empty lots, under porches\u2014but the question is whether we will manage them responsibly or just let the problem grow."

      "text": "Pocket-Sized to Gentle Giants: The Most Popular Rabbit Breeds You Can Own As A Pet\n- Share via\nThink a rabbit is just a rabbit? Think again. The world of domestic bunnies is a wild and wonderful place filled with an incredible variety of rabbits, all very different from wild rabbits. You can officially find nearly 50 breeds in the U.S. recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association, and over double that in the U.K. Each one has its own quirks looks and personality.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nDespite the extraordinarily large amount of rabbit breeds out there, there\u2019s a small subset that happen to be the most popular rabbit breeds that people prefer to own as pets in the United States. We\u2019re talking about everything from energetic little pocket rockets to massive couch-potato fluffballs. Finding the right one is less about picking a pet and more about finding your perfect furry roommate.\nThe Pint-Sized Powerhouses\nNetherland Dwarf\nThis is one of the smallest rabbit breeds on the block, barely tipping the scales at 2.5 pounds. They were developed in the Netherlands in the early 20th century. Now they are one of the most popular pet breeds worldwide largely thanks to their perpetually baby-faced look. Don\u2019t let their size fool you; they pack a whole lot of energy and can be a bit reserved with new people. You\u2019ll want to keep an eye on their teeth as their tiny mouths can sometimes lead to dental issues.\nPolish Rabbit\nAnother petite package, the Polish rabbit is a compact breed weighing around 3.5 pounds. Their name is a bit of a misnomer. They likely originated in England or Belgium and are one of the oldest recognized breeds. These guys are known for being wonderfully gentle and calm, making them a great fit for quieter homes that want a small friend without the skittishness.\nMini Lop\nThe Mini Lop is famous for those signature floppy ears. It\u2019s a tad bigger than true dwarfs but makes a perfect apartment dweller. They were created in the United States in the 1970s and their cuddly dog-like personality made them an instant hit. Mini Lops tend to be total socialites who love hanging out with their owners. Their playful nature makes them a fantastic pick for first-time rabbit parents.\nNot Too Big, Not Too Small\nDutch Rabbit\nThe Dutch rabbit is instantly recognizable with its classic color pattern, like it\u2019s wearing a little tuxedo. They are one of the oldest breeds and most beloved, with texts describing their distinct markings as far back as the 1800s. They weigh between 4 and 5.5 pounds and are famously friendly and patient. This temperament is why they\u2019re consistently recommended for families with kids.\nMini Rex\nThis rabbit feels like pure velvet. The unique Rex fur mutation was first discovered in France back in 1919. The Mini Rex is a smaller version developed in the U.S. that absolutely exploded in popularity. Its plush velvety coat is a dream to touch and its calm curious personality makes it a joy to have around. They\u2019re relatively easy to train and their fur is surprisingly low-maintenance.\nCinnamon Rabbit\nThe Cinnamon rabbit is a bit bigger but just as sweet and a great gateway to larger breeds. This breed was a happy accident created in the 1960s from a crossbreeding project in Montana. These reddish-brown bunnies weigh 8 to 11 pounds. They are sturdy affectionate and perfect for anyone wanting a more substantial rabbit without committing to a giant.\nBelgian Hare\nDon\u2019t let the name fool you. The Belgian Hare is all rabbit, but it was selectively bred in Belgium to look just like a wild hare. It has a long, lean, graceful body and a rich red coat that gives it the look of a tiny thoroughbred horse. These rabbits are incredibly intelligent and active. They can also be a bit high-strung so they are often a better match for experienced owners. This breed actually sparked a massive craze in America around 1900. People paid fortunes for breeding stock right before the market bubble burst.\nGo Big or Go Home\nFlemish Giant\nThis is the Great Dane of the rabbit world, one of the giant breeds often weighing a whopping 15 to 20 pounds. They originate from Flanders, Belgium. People originally bred them for meat and fur but their docile nature quickly made them a popular exhibition and pet rabbit. Their intimidating size is misleading as they are famously sweet-tempered, earning them the \u201cgentle giant\u201d nickname. Just make sure you have the space to accommodate a pet that\u2019s more lap-sized than lap dog.\nCheckered Giant\nThe athlete of the big-bun category, the Checkered Giant is known for its bold black or blue spots. They were developed in Germany around 1904 specifically for their striking arched body type and unique markings for the show ring. They weigh 10 to 15 pounds. They\u2019re calm but love to play so they need plenty of room to stretch their legs.\nGiant Chinchilla\nThe Giant Chinchilla delivers for those who want size and softness. A relatively new breed, this is an American original created in the 1920s with the goal of producing a larger, more commercial breed of rabbit with the valuable Chinchilla coat. Chinchilla rabbits are 12-to-16-pounds and have fur that rivals the softness of their namesake but come with bigger needs for food, grooming and space.\nFor Those Who Love to Groom\nAngora Rabbit\nThe supermodel of this group, the Angora is a literal cloud of wool-like fur. This is one of the oldest domestic rabbit breeds. They originated in Ankara, Turkey (formerly Angora) and were a favorite of French royalty in the 1700s. They\u2019re gentle souls but be prepared for a serious grooming commitment to keep their magnificent coats from matting.\nJersey Wooly\nThe Jersey Wooly is a great choice for a slightly less demanding fluffball. They were developed in New Jersey in the 1980s with the goal of creating a small woolly rabbit with a more manageable coat. People nicknamed it the \u201cno-kick bunny\u201d for its sweet disposition. This compact three-pounder still needs regular grooming.\nSo What\u2019s The Right Call?\nIt all comes down to a little matchmaking. A tiny Netherland Dwarf might be perfect for your city apartment while a sprawling Flemish Giant needs a house with a yard. A low-key Mini Rex can fit a busy schedule. A high-maintenance Angora is a dream for someone who loves to primp and pamper their pet. Do your homework to understand the rabbit\u2019s care needs and find the personality that clicks with yours and you\u2019ll have more than just a pet. You\u2019ll have a fantastic new companion."

The average cat spends nearly half its waking hours in a self-grooming marathon. But even though most cats do a decent job on their own, they still need a little help from their humans.\nRegular grooming sessions are about more than a shiny coat or fewer loose hairs on your couch. According to the Cornell Feline Health Center, they\u2019re essential for catching problems early on, like skin irritation, fleas or bald patches that need a vet\u2019s attention.\nFor those especially tricky coats or stubborn mats (or even just stubborn cats), a professional groomer makes life easier for both of you.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nWhy Every Cat Loves a Good Brush\nEver wondered why cats shed so much? It\u2019s because they\u2019re constantly losing dead hair. If you don\u2019t help them remove it with regular brushing, a lot of it ends up as hairballs or a soft layer on your favorite black sweater. Brushing also spreads those magical natural oils across your cat\u2019s body, giving that sought-after shiny look.\nThe American Veterinary Medical Association points out that grooming sessions are a great time to spot external parasites, bumps or skin changes you\u2019d otherwise miss. Indoor cats and older cats, in particular, really benefit from the extra help.\nBrush, Comb, or Mitt? Picking the Perfect Tool\nHaving the right tools makes the grooming process a lot more pleasant. For long-haired breeds, a wide-toothed comb or heavier duty brush works wonders on tangles. The Maxpower Planet Pet Grooming Brush ($15.99) is a grooming rake that can tackle the heaviest tangles in your cat\u2019s coat.\nFor medium-haired cats, you\u2019ll do well with brushes designed to remove loose hair without tugging. Well & Good make a variety of simple cat brushes of this type.\nMost short-haired cats usually just need a soft brush or a grooming mitt. The Delomo Purple Glove ($13) is popular with many cat owners. Made of silicon, it offers both a grooming solution as well as a gentle massage that cats love.\nIf you don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got time for regular grooming, you can always splurge and get the PawSwing Autocomb Pro ($599), which grooms your cat every time it passes through the hole in the box-like contraption.\nThe Gentle Clip: Keeping Claws in Check\nTrimming your cat\u2019s nails is just as important as keeping her fur tidy. Overgrown claws can get caught in furniture or even curve painfully into the paw pads. Regular nail trims help prevent problems, and scratching posts are a great way to keep claws in shape between trims. Experts at International Cat Care recommend nail trimming every two to four weeks.\nIf you\u2019re nervous about accidentally cutting into the blood vessels, just ask your vet for a quick demonstration. If your cat hates having her feet touched, start slow\u2014handle her paws during quiet moments and always reward patience with a treat.\nHow to Know if It\u2019s Time for the Tub\nThe ASPCA reminds us that bathing cats isn\u2019t usually a routine necessity. But sometimes, especially with allergies, skin problems or a particularly messy adventure, a bath is unavoidable. When that happens, avoid human shampoo, which can cause skin irritation. Instead, choose a gentle, cat-specific shampoo like Earthbath Hypoallergenic ($17.99).\nIf your cat panics at the sound of water, you\u2019re not alone. Fortunately, waterless shampoos are available. According to The Spruce Pets, these come in foams, sprays and wipes that are perfect for spot cleaning. TropiClean makes their waterless shampoo from natural ingredients and can be used in minutes. Just make sure to choose a formula that is safe for cats and fragrance-free, such as TropiClean Hyop-Allergenic Waterless Shampoo ($12.99). If you don\u2019t have waterless shampoo and you\u2019re in a pinch, a damp cloth is great for spot cleaning.\nThe Final Polish: A Gentle Ear Clean\nEar cleaning is an essential part of a cat\u2019s grooming routine, even though many cats don\u2019t need it often. Keep an eye out for redness, swelling, or a strong odor, which can be signs of infection. When it\u2019s time to clean, use a vet-approved ear cleaning solution and a cotton ball. Never a cotton swab, which can damage the inner ear.\nGently wipe the visible part of the ear and avoid going deep into the ear canal. If you see an unusual amount of dark discharge or if your cat seems to be in pain, it\u2019s time to call your vet.\nNo matter your cat\u2019s coat or age, grooming is a simple way to care for their body and boost their wellbeing. Whether you\u2019re brushing, clipping or just spending time together, you\u2019re giving them more than a clean coat. You\u2019re giving them comfort, connection and a healthy, happy life."

      "text": "Pet Projects: Q&A with CatCon Founder Susan Michals\n- Share via\nEvery summer, thousands of cat lovers, artists, and feline celebrities descend on Pasadena for CatCon, a one-of-a-kind convention that\u2019s part art show, part adoption fair, and part community celebration of all things cat. Founded by journalist and producer Susan Michals, CatCon has grown in ten years from niche event into the country\u2019s biggest gathering for fans of felines.\nWe talked with Susan to talk about the evolution of CatCon, the changing image of the \u201ccat person,\u201d and why supporting small businesses and animal welfare is at the heart of it all. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nQ: Can you share a bit about your background and how you went from being a journalist to launching CatCon and other cat-focused projects?\nSure, I worked for years at E on shows like Keeping Up With The Kardashians and Live from the Red Carpet. I was lead producer for promos for 160 countries outside of the US. At the same time, I like to say you know this is LA, everybody has kind of a side hustle these days, two or three jobs. I really wanted to be a journalist, and I worked for Wall Street Journal, Vanity Fair, Huffington Post. But it wasn\u2019t my ticket out of my day job, because, as a freelance journalist it doesn\u2019t really pay that well.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nSo I moved from celebrity into the art world because I have an art background. And the first show I created was Cat Art Show. That debuted in 2014 with established artists\u2014my headliners were Shepard Fairey, Mark Wright and Gary Baseman, all LA-based artists. And then I had emerging artists as well. 4000 people showed up at that show, and I realized that this was a demographic of cat lovers that was not being represented.\nQ: What made you realize there was a need for something like CatCon, and how did it get started?\nAt that point, the only thing on the feline landscape was really the breeder shows, sort of the best of breed, the Westminster Dog Show kind of thing. But regular cat fans were not being represented. Many of these fans were a younger demographic. And so I thought, you know what? I want to do a bigger show, like a convention that would appeal to them, and I needed to curate it like an art show.\nI decided I wanted to do information, education and entertainment. Because what I found is that people really wanted to learn a lot about their animals, and you can make even a topic like \u201cclipping your cat\u2019s nails\u201d sexy if you have the right speaker, the right title, and a dynamic person on stage to talk about what this means.\nQ: How did the first CatCon come together, and what did you learn from that initial experience?\nThe first year, there was only three of us working on this. I curated all the exhibitors. I had people apply. I put together a workshop schedule, a celebri-cat schedule. I wanted it to be immersive as well, and so I thought up activations and I pitched sponsors and sort of brought it all together.\nI will say is that my experience working in production and as a journalist really lent itself to putting on a convention, because it is a production in its own right. I brought on people that had done trade shows and worked Comic Con and the Toy Fair to really help me build this show from the ground up, and they are still with me to this day.\nQ: Supporting artists and small businesses seems like a major part of CatCon. Why is that important to you, and how does the event help local communities?\nIt\u2019s very important for me to offer opportunity to small businesses. Very, very important. It goes back to the Cat Art Show of emerging and established artists. Big sponsors help to support us and finance the show, but it\u2019s very important to me in this curatorial process of picking exhibitors to support those that are on Etsy. Those that are small businesses and give them the opportunity to showcase their wares and their talents.\nAnd it was also very important for us to give back to the city of Pasadena and Altadena. We have been, as a community, ravaged by the recent fires, and Pasadena Humane is still boarding animals that their owners have not found a place to live. They\u2019re continuing to board and support the people of this community by taking care of their animals. Pasadena Humane and the city of Pasadena have been so good to us. Los Angeles in general for the past 10 years, but specifically Pasadena since 2017.\nQ: Cat ownership has a lot of stereotypes. How have you seen CatCon help shift those perceptions?\nThere\u2019s this\u2014and it\u2019s still very present\u2014this negative association with cat ownership, the crazy cat lady. Cat ladies are 60 plus, hoarders, spinsters, Grey Gardens, Dickensian characters. They live with 1000 cats, smell like cat pee, and are unmarried, right?\nI will tell you that through the years I get asked two questions every time I say I run a cat convention. The first question is, \u201cHow many cats do you have?\u201d And I say one, and people are shocked. I have one cat and one dog.\nAnd a second question that I get asked, which I think is really actually rude, but it\u2019s what I get asked, is, \u201cAre you married?\u201d Every time I say I am between husbands at the moment, but that\u2019s not what defines me.\nAnd what I found is that, over the years, with CatCon, I think we\u2019ve made a significant dent in what it means to be a cat person. It\u2019s when you put the word crazy in front of cat lady that has the negative connotation.\nWhen you say Catwoman versus cat lady, what do you think of? Catwoman\u2014strong and fierce and independent, right? Sexy, right? When you look at the word cat lady, it\u2019s the exact opposite\u2014somebody that you don\u2019t want to be with, somebody that isn\u2019t empowered. What we\u2019ve seen over the years with CatCon is the rise of a different cat lady. It is a combination of empowerment, passion, enthusiasm, and independence.\nQ: CatCon is clearly more than just a trade show. What are some ways you keep the experience immersive and up-to-date with cat culture trends?\nOur convention is not just cat food and cat litter. We had Petfinder there talking about adoptions. We have people that are bringing the latest in cat tech in water fountains and smart litter boxes and AI and all these different things. We have people that are creating clothing for humans that is cat-centric. We had a fashion show on Saturday called Project Catwalk, where people were given the idea of elevating the cat lady.\nQ: The event draws an impressive range of attendees. Can you share more about the community and celebrities involved?\nWhat I love about CatCon is: there\u2019s no dog park for the cat person, right? There\u2019s no place to commune, and it\u2019s a community of people that come together to share one single purpose: that they love kitties. Animals give us such wonderful unconditional love and it\u2019s my job to create something year after year that people want to come back for.\nThere are so many celebrities that are cat lovers and we\u2019re right here in Los Angeles so we get a lot of visits from the stars. We had Jake Johnson there. Matt Groening from The Simpsons was there. Lisa Loeb was there. Alexandra Shipp, Seth Green. David Dastmalchian was there from MurderBot and Dexter. He came with his family, and Gilles Marini comes all the time. It\u2019s amazing to see them show up and support the event, to help raise our profile and get the word out.\nQ: In recent years, we\u2019ve seen the \u201cadventure cat\u201d phenomenon take off. Has this also changed the perception of cats and cat owners?\nWith the advent of the adventure cat, of which we had a number at CatCon, it\u2019s no longer that cats are just indoor creatures. Now, I would say the majority of them are still very much indoor creatures, but we are seeing this definitive shift.You will see hotels that say pet friendly and you have to see if they take cats specifically but a lot more have started to. Hyatt, Sheraton, case by case, they\u2019re starting to accept cats, because we are seeing this uptick in people taking their cats with them when they travel.\nThe adventure cats that come to CatCon are like Hollywood child stars. They\u2019ve been doing this since they were little, so they\u2019re used to this sort of thing, the crowds and the attention. We have all these kitties this year who did meet and greets, and they average 100 meet and greets per hour.\nWe had two cats, Sponge Cake and Buttercream. They travel with their owners all over the world in a backpack. They just got back from Venice and they\u2019ve got 2 million followers.\nQ: What keeps you motivated year after year to keep growing and evolving CatCon?\nWhat I know about Hollywood and sort of the way we live now is you can do a phenomenal job, but every year you\u2019ve got to up the ante. And I welcome that challenge, because I want to keep it fresh. And that\u2019s why I work on CatCon all year round, because I\u2019m looking for what\u2019s going to make this audience come back. What\u2019s going to make them happy, and what\u2019s going to help them make a better life for them and their pets.\nQ: Tell us about your latest project, The Meow Factor. What is it, and where do you see it going?\nI spoke at South by Southwest in 2019, and I really loved it. And I would really love to do a TED Talk eventually. I love public speaking. And I thought, you know, there\u2019s really nothing out there for cat people in\u2014I mean, sure you can watch TikTok videos, you can watch a YouTube video, but how do I continue to bring the community together in person? So what I decided to do was to create this sort of salon environment called The Meow Factor.\nWe did something about my\u2014basically, my cat\u2019s a celebrity, and how I\u2019m dealing with that. We did something on cat portraiture. And then we did something with Nathan the Cat Lady and Sterling the Trap King about trap neuter return. I\u2019m creating more of a salon setting. It\u2019s not 300 people, it\u2019s 50 people so there\u2019s better engagement and opportunity to ask more questions.\nI\u2019ve already done it at Annenberg Pet Space, and it\u2019s something that I\u2019m looking at branching out across the country. Once I get a little bit of rest after CatCon, I\u2019m definitely going to continue on my kitty trajectory.\nQ: And finally, when can we expect the next Cat Art Show?\nIt\u2019s going to be sometime next year. January 2024 was 10 years, and I do it every two, so at some point next year. I don\u2019t know where it\u2019ll be or precisely when, but stay tuned!"

      "text": "The Bunny Basics: What Every New Rabbit Owner Should Know\n- Share via\nWhen you picture a pet rabbit you might picture a cute, fluffy ball of fur sitting in a garden hutch. But for those looking to add a rabbit to their home, the truth is rabbits are social animals that need more than just a little box in the backyard. They want interaction with their owner and a home built just for them. Their care can be similar to that of a cat or a dog (litter box training included!), but the reward is a funny, curious, and unique pet.\nWhen bringing a bunny into the home you must remember first and foremost that rabbits are prey animals. This means they feel safest when they have a secure space with plenty of hiding spots. They\u2019ve also got a very specific diet of mostly grass, hay and leafy greens that not only fuels them but also keeps their continuously growing teeth trimmed down. When you get their setup just right you reduce their stress, support their health and end up with a happy companion.\nChoosing the Right Pet Rabbit for Your Home\nNot all rabbits are the same. Giant breeds, they\u2019re impressive but need a ton of space. Long-haired breeds, super cute but they require constant grooming. Even if you pick a smaller rabbit for a compact home, their energy levels and temperament can be all over the place. Doing some research on different breeds will help you find a rabbit that truly matches your lifestyle.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nSingle Rabbit or Bonded Pair?\nThen you have to decide, one or two? A single rabbit can do just fine with lots of human attention. But many people choose to adopt bonded pairs, because rabbits are so social they\u2019re often happiest when they have another rabbit around. Before you make a decision, don\u2019t forget the financial side of things. Food, supplies and veterinary care are all ongoing costs that add up quickly. Once you\u2019re ready to adopt you can find a reputable breeder or even a rescue organization, as many take in rabbits in addition to cats and dogs.\nSetting Up a Safe and Comfortable Rabbit Enclosure\nEvery rabbit deserves a home that\u2019s roomy, well-ventilated and impossible to escape from. You should stay away from wire-bottom cages, they can give your rabbit sore feet. Keep their enclosure in a room with stable temperatures. Too much heat can be a danger. Make sure they have plenty of hiding spots inside their space like cardboard boxes, tunnels or even a simple blanket draped over a chair. Cleanliness is crucial. Make sure you\u2019re scrubbing their enclosure regularly to stop any disease from starting.\nDaily Rabbit Care\nHow to Litter Train a Rabbit Successfully\nYes, rabbits can learn how to use a litter box! Pick a litter box and fill it with a rabbit-safe material like recycled paper or aspen. Encourage them to use it after they eat, and be sure to offer gentle praise when they get it right. A diet high in fiber from hay and greens keeps their digestion regular, which helps a lot with training.\nAccidents will happen so don\u2019t punish them when they occur. Just guide them back to the right spot. If you notice any sudden changes in their litter box habits it could be a sign they need a vet visit.\nRabbit Diet Basics: Hay, Pellets, Vegetables, and Treats\nFor rabbits, food is medicine. The bulk of their diet should be grass hay, like timothy or orchard grass. A small daily scoop of pellets adds nutrients, but keep that amount modest. Leafy greens such as kale or spinach provide much-needed vitamins but introduce them gradually to avoid a tummy ache.\nWater should always be available. Despite what you see on many rabbit cages, many rabbits prefer drinking from a bowl. It\u2019s much more natural for them than a bottle.\nTreats like fruits and starchy vegetables should be given only in very small amounts. Too much sugar or starch can cause digestive upset and tooth decay.\nSocializing and Handling Rabbits\nYou should always handle a rabbit by supporting their body, never by their ears or tail. If you can, start when they\u2019re young, but no matter what always go slow and be consistent. This kind of gentle handling reduces their fear and stress over time. You can also carefully expose them to different people and environments. With practice, they\u2019ll become calmer in new situations. Some owners even work with trainers or classes to help with socialization.\nExercise and Playtime Needs for Pet Rabbits\nA rabbit that is stuck in their enclosure all day isn\u2019t a healthy rabbit. They need two to three hours of exercise outside their space every day. You can let them out in a rabbit-proofed room indoors or in a secure, supervised pen outside. Give them tunnels, climbing structures, and balls to encourage movement. If you have a bonded pair, they\u2019ll naturally spur each other on. Don\u2019t overlook downtime; rabbits love to sprint, but they also need stretches of quiet rest.\nRabbit Health and Veterinary Care\nCommon Rabbit Health Issues and Care Tips\nRabbits are masters at hiding illness making regular veterinary care a must. You should be able to find a vet with rabbit experience and schedule routine check-ups. You should also be monitoring their appetite, stool and behavior every day. Call the vet immediately if you notice any changes. Preventive care is also important, from vaccinations to parasite control. Because rabbit healthcare costs can escalate quickly, many owners find pet insurance to be a smart safeguard.\nPreventing Fly Strike and Other Rabbit Health Risks\nA few conditions are particularly dangerous for rabbits. Fly strike is one of the worst. This is when flies lay eggs on wet fur and then maggots develop quickly. The good news is it can be prevented with good hygiene. Keep their bedding dry, remove any uneaten food and check your rabbit\u2019s fur often during warm months. If you ever see eggs or maggots, it\u2019s an emergency and you should take them to the vet right away. Rabbits shed seasonally and benefit from regular brushing just like a cat or dog. This prevents mats and actually even helps with digestion.\nGrooming Rabbits: Brushing, Nail Trims, and Hygiene\nYou also need to trim their nails regularly to prevent pain (and scratching). Check their eyes, ears and teeth often for any sign of infection or decay. You should spot-clean their enclosure daily and deep-clean it once a week to keep bacteria at bay.\nRaising a Rabbit Is Worth the Commitment\nRaising a rabbit is an incredibly rewarding experience, but it\u2019s not a low-maintenance commitment. They are quirky, complex creatures that require real attention, from a specific diet to a bunny-proofed home. However, all the effort you put in\u2014the careful feeding, the time spent playing, and the constant check-ins\u2014is absolutely worth it. When a bunny really trusts you, their personality comes alive and you realize there\u2019s no pet quite like a healthy, hoppy rabbit!"

      "text": "Cat Scratching Solutions: Expert Advice to Save Your Sofa\n- Share via\nCat scratching. It\u2019s as natural to felines as purring or chasing a toy. It\u2019s not misbehavior. It\u2019s an instinct that\u2019s essential for their physical and emotional well-being.\nBut when your sofa arms start looking like shredded wheat it\u2019s hard not to get frustrated. Hannah McCoy, owner of Hannah\u2019s Cat Training in Los Angeles, has over 20 years experience in the field. She says scratching is not just necessary for the physical health of your cat but also for mental and emotional well-being. She explains, \u201cCats need to be able to frequently scratch objects in their environment to feel safe in their own territory. It helps them know they are \u2018home\u2019 and it boosts their confidence.\u201d\nScratching lets cats keep their nails healthy, stretch their bodies and leave scent marks. Many cats pick high-traffic spots or sturdy surfaces like couch corners because these are ideal for scent marking and a good stretch. Once a cat starts scratching a particular item it becomes a familiar place and almost a ritual.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nProactive Cat Training: The Key to Preventing Unwanted Scratching\nMcCoy emphasizes that scratching is very much a pattern. Like dogs who revisit the same trees on walks, cats return to favorite scratching spots throughout the day. She says, \u201cOnce your cat has started scratching an object, it has their scent deposited. This makes it more difficult to switch them over to the right objects than just preventing it from the get go.\u201d So don\u2019t wait for damage to happen. You need to anticipate your cat\u2019s need to scratch and offer suitable alternatives from the beginning.\nHow to Choose and Place the Best Cat Scratching Posts\nMost cats prefer sisal rope or corrugated cardboard for scratching, but style and placement matter just as much as the material. McCoy points out a common mistake of putting scratching posts far away from furniture in hopes cats will ignore the couch and find the post. She says your cat is naturally going to decide where in your house they want to scratch and if the scratchers you provide are nowhere near there, they will ignore the scratchers and continue scratching the wrong items.\nShe suggests instead placing posts directly beside furniture or areas that your cat will likely want to or have already begun to scratch. These items need to be out in social areas and there need to be several on each level of the house. Ideally at least one in each main room that the cat will spend time in.\nVariety matters too. Some cats prefer vertical posts for a full-body stretch while others like horizontal pads or ramps. Offering multiple styles and making sure each is sturdy and accessible greatly increases your success.\nRedirecting Cat Scratching: How to Train Cats to Use Scratching Posts\nDon\u2019t panic if your cat has already started scratching the wrong spot. Block access to the damaged area using a plastic barrier, furniture cover or rearranging items and immediately place a scratching post or mat nearby. McCoy recommends setting up enticing and desirable scratching items nearby where your cat has shown they already want to do this behavior. Reward them with a treat and praise every time you catch them doing it.\nAdding catnip spray, treats or toys to the new scratcher can make it more appealing. Sticky tape or foil can discourage your cat from returning to the old spot since the texture is unpleasant for their claws.\nTraining Mistakes to Avoid: What Not to Do When Cats Scratch Furniture\nPunishing cats for scratching by yelling, spraying water or clapping doesn\u2019t work and often makes things worse McCoy warns. \u201cThey are not just filing their nails, scratching is actually a very nuanced behavior. When you suddenly get angry and begin chastising them, this is very confusing for them and creates stress and conflict.\u201d In some cases, the attention, even negative, can reinforce the behavior. Instead, focus on positive reinforcement and making the right choices easy for your cat.\nCat Scratching and Stress: Helping Anxious Cats Feel Secure\nIf your cat\u2019s scratching seems excessive or destructive, stress could be the root cause. Scratching is a stress-relieving behavior, McCoy explains. A cat with increased stress absolutely will have a desire to scratch more in an effort to blow off some steam and increase their sense of safety and confidence in their home. Look for changes in the household, new pets or routine disruptions and provide safe quiet zones and consistent routines to help your cat feel secure.\nEssential Tools and Tips to Protect Furniture From Cat Scratching\nNail Trimming: Regularly trimming your cat\u2019s claws as part of the grooming process can minimize damage during the training process.\nNail Caps: Temporary, humane vinyl nail caps are available to help protect surfaces.\nAvoid Declawing: Never declaw. It\u2019s inhumane and in some states illegal. It leads to severe short-term and long-term pain plus behavioral problems.\nMcCoy is clear that it\u2019s a biological and instinctive need and your cat is going to do it. It is up to you to anticipate it and to prevent them from doing it in unwanted areas. Also to proactively ensure they do it in the right areas from the day they arrive in your home. Addressing scratching early and positively can prevent bigger problems like rehoming or surrender for something that was entirely preventable."

      "text": "The Training Every Puppy Needs in Their First Weeks\n- Share via\nWe spend so much time thinking about a dog\u2019s physical health. The right food. The right walks. Regular vet visits. But what about their mind? That\u2019s the part people tend to overlook. Dr. Ian Dunbar, one of the most respected dog trainers in the world, says this is a gap we need to close. And not just for dogs. Cats, horses, any domestic animal needs their mental health cared for just as much as their body.\nToo often the conversation starts with blaming \u201cirresponsible owners.\u201d Is that fair? A first-time puppy parent can\u2019t know what they haven\u2019t been shown. The real question is whether the people who do know better are stepping in early enough. Breeders put in the work for the first eight weeks. Vets and pet store employees only see new owners for a few minutes. Trainers often don\u2019t meet puppies until the most important early period has passed. Shelters usually meet them even later when habits are already well established.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nAbout twenty years ago, Dunbar decided to do something about it. He wrote Before You Get Your Puppy and After You Get Your Puppy, books that lay out exactly what new owners should do and when. At first the books were printed and handed out in shelters and clinics. Then they became free eBooks anyone could download. Later, he added a third title, The Good Little Dog Book, along with several free online courses. Together they form a clear plan for raising a well-adjusted dog from the very beginning.\nThe Two Most Urgent Lessons to Teach Your New Puppy\nDunbar says two things can\u2019t wait. Setting a household manners schedule and socializing a puppy with people before twelve weeks of age. The clock starts the day you bring them home.\nEstablishing a Household Schedule\nA routine helps your puppy learn how to live in your world without confusion. Start with house training. Show them where and when to go, praise them when they get it right, clean up if they don\u2019t.\nChewing habits come next. Feeding meals from sturdy hollow chew toys keeps them busy, cuts down on barking and pacing, and gives them a hobby they can enjoy when alone. Those short moments alone are important. They help prevent the anxiety that can develop if a dog never learns how to be by themselves.\nTraining can start here too. Keep it light and playful. Teach \u201ccome,\u201d \u201csit,\u201d \u201cstay,\u201d and \u201cwatch.\u201d Practice \u201cstand\u201d for examination or \u201croll over\u201d for grooming. Dunbar calls this English as a Second Language for dogs. The more words they understand, the easier it is to guide them through daily life.\nSocializing Before Twelve Weeks\nThe window for socialization training closes quickly. Around twelve weeks puppies start getting cautious and nervous around new people and situations. To avoid that, bring the world to your puppy in a way that feels safe.\nInvite friends of all different looks and styles. Hats, sunglasses, hoodies, even costumes. Let your puppy meet them at home where they already feel secure.\nWhen you can, take your puppy on controlled outings. Carry them downtown to watch the world go by. Park in a busy area with a sign inviting friendly people to come over and give pets. These early experiences create small stress spikes that teach puppies how to recover quickly. Later in life, they\u2019re less likely to overreact to something new.\nThe Two Most Important Lessons: Skills for Life\nUrgent tasks set the stage. Important ones keep shaping a dog\u2019s future. Dunbar says bite inhibition and ongoing socialization matter most here.\nBite Inhibition: The Safety Skill\nBite inhibition means controlling the force of a bite. It\u2019s the single most important safety skill a dog can have. Puppies learn it best in off-leash play with other dogs. Those sharp little teeth teach each other what\u2019s too rough. Over time, as their jaws get stronger, they figure out how to soften their bite so they never harm anyone during play or disagreements.\nThe common mistake is stopping all mouthing too soon. Without the chance to practice, puppies don\u2019t develop control. With humans, the lesson can be taught through hand-feeding while practicing \u201coff,\u201d \u201ctake it,\u201d and \u201cgently.\u201d If you miss this stage, you can still teach an adult dog bite inhibition but it\u2019s slower, harder, and riskier.\nSocialization Beyond Puppyhood\nSocialization doesn\u2019t end at twelve weeks. A good puppy class gives dogs a safe place to meet other dogs and people. It teaches them how to read canine body language and handle different play styles. This confidence follows them into adulthood and makes it easier for them to handle new situations calmly.\nHelping More Puppies Get the Education They Deserve\nDunbar has spent decades trying to get this information into every new dog owner\u2019s hands. His eBooks and courses are free and meant to be shared with friends, neighbors, clients and other dog lovers. Shelters and businesses can even add their own name to the covers before sharing.\nEvery puppy is asking for the same thing whether they know it or not. The chance to grow up confident, capable, and connected to their people. Giving them that chance isn\u2019t just good training. It\u2019s the start of a great life together.\nDownload Dr. Dunbar\u2019s two free ebooks Before You Get Your Puppy and After You Get Your Puppy, HERE"

      "text": "How to Prepare and What to Do When Your Pet Faces an Emergency\n- Share via\nThings happen to pets so fast. A cut paw. A sudden collapse. Trouble breathing. When a crisis hits, you don\u2019t have time to look things up. Knowing the basics of first aid and having a plan ready won\u2019t replace your vet, but it can buy you precious time until you get there.\nBefore you rush in to save the day it\u2019s important to take a moment. An injured or scared pet might lash out without meaning to. Make sure the scene is safe for both of you. Once you\u2019ve done that, check on your pet: are they breathing? Are they responsive? Is there any bleeding?\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nIf you suspect they have spinal or pelvic injuries, don\u2019t move them unless you have no other choice. If they\u2019re unconscious but still breathing you should gently roll them onto their side to keep their airway clear. If your pet is unresponsive or showing other serious signs, it\u2019s imperative to call your vet or the nearest emergency clinic immediately.\nThese are all signs it\u2019s time to get help now: heavy bleeding, pale gums, vomiting or diarrhea that won\u2019t stop, difficulty breathing, confusion, or a sudden swelling of the face.\nYour Go-To Kit for a Crisis\nA simple first aid kit can be a total lifesaver. Stock it with the essentials: gauze, tape, elastic wrap, a digital thermometer and a blanket to keep them warm. Add a muzzle or a towel to prevent bites because even the sweetest pets can snap when they\u2019re in pain. Keep your vet\u2019s number and the ASPCA Poison Control hotline (888-426-4435) taped inside the kit for quick reference.\nCommon Emergencies and How to Handle Them\nDifferent emergencies require different action. Here\u2019s a look at some of the most common scenarios you might face:\nBleeding:\nApply steady pressure with gauze. Hold the wound up if you can to slow the blood flow. You can use a firm bandage if the bleeding won\u2019t stop. Just remember that tourniquets are only for life-or-death situations.\nPoisoning:\nThis is one of the most common emergencies. In 2023 the ASPCA handled over 400,000 cases. Many were caused by human medications. If you suspect your pet has ingested something toxic, call the ASPCA Poison Control hotline. Don\u2019t try to make your pet vomit unless the professional on the line tells you to. It\u2019s also critical to save the packaging of whatever they ingested to show your vet. Avoid home remedies as they can do more harm than good.\nHeatstroke:\nMove your pet to a cool and shaded spot. Pour cool, but not icy, water on their body. If they\u2019re alert you can give them small sips of water. Even if they seem to be recovering, take them to a vet. Heatstroke can cause serious internal organ damage.\nDrowning:\nIf your pet isn\u2019t breathing after you get them out of the water, start rescue breaths immediately. Wrap them in a blanket to keep them warm. Even if they seem to recover quickly, have a vet check them for secondary health issues.\nThe Emergency Plan for Disasters\nEmergencies aren\u2019t always a singular and totally unforeseeen event. Disasters like fires, floods and hurricanes force families to leave their homes every year. According to an ASPCA survey, more than 80% of pet owners live in a disaster-prone area, but less than half have a plan for their animals.\nYou should create a separate emergency kit just for your pet. It should include food and bottled water for three to seven days, plus any medications and medical records. Make sure you have a collar with tags, a leash and a sturdy carrier. Pack photos of your pet in case you need to prove ownership. Toss in a favorite blanket or toy for comfort.\nContacts are just as important. Save your vet\u2019s number, the nearest 24-hour animal hospital and the poison control hotline on your phone and on a piece of paper. You should also think about an alternate route to care in case your usual one is blocked. Consider how you\u2019ll move your pet if your car isn\u2019t an option.\nHow to Help a Stressed Pet\nAn animal in pain may growl, snap or try to run away. Talk in a calm voice. Move slowly. Use only as much restraint as you need. Sometimes draping a towel over their eyes can help calm them down. Avoid touching painful areas unless you have no other choice.\nPrevention is Key\nMany emergencies can be prevented with a little common sense. Store chemicals and toxic foods out of reach. Make sure your fences are secure and your pet can\u2019t escape. Stay current with vet checkups and vaccinations.\nIt\u2019s also important to know the mistakes that can make things worse. These include waiting too long to get care, giving human medications without a vet\u2019s advice, pulling out objects stuck in your pet\u2019s body and misusing a tourniquet. First aid is meant to stabilize, not to completely solve the problem.\nWhy It All Matters\nOne in three pets will need emergency treatment at some point this year. A pet is treated in an emergency clinic every 2.5 seconds in the United States, and the average bill is more than $500. Yet fewer than half of owners feel financially ready for it. You can create an emergency saving account dedicated to vet bills if the day ever comes, putting aside a little each month. Pet insurance is also gaining in popularity, as coverage for pets gets better and better.\nBeing prepared helps your pet, but it also helps you. When you have a kit, a plan, and the know-how, you can stay calm in the middle of chaos. And when it comes to a crisis, a calm mind can make all the difference."
