  "description": "New Nests are coming.",
  "content": "Google announced plenty of new hardware at this week\u2019s Made by Google event, but halfway through we were distracted by the brief appearance of what appeared to be a new, previously unknown Gemini-powered smart speaker. Now Android Headlines claims that this speaker is real, and will launch with new colors and the ability to pair with a Google TV Streamer.\n\nAndroid Headlines reports that it\u2019s seen additional images of the mystery speaker, which will apparently come in four colors: bright red, light green, black, and white. As seen briefly in the keynote video, it features a light around the base \u2014 rather than across the top, as on previous Google speakers \u2014 and a fabric finish.\n\nAs for features, the big new one is that the speaker will apparently be able to pair with a Google TV Streamer to deliver spatial TV audio, a trick borrowed from Apple\u2019s HomePods, which can connect to Apple TV hardware. Hopefully it can also connect to TVs that run the Google TV OS. It will apparently also include new natural voice options, the ability to detect unusual sounds like glass breaking or a smoke alarm, and full support for Matter.\n\nGemini will deliver the smarts, rather than Google Assistant, which is no surprise. The company announced Gemini for Home this week, which will arrive on existing Nest smart speakers and displays from October this year. It will include a paid tier and support for Gemini Live, though it\u2019s not clear which features will be gated behind the premium subscription.\n\nAndroid Headlines calls the new hardware the \u201cHome Speaker,\u201d though it\u2019s not clear if that\u2019s its full or final name. We also don\u2019t know when it will be released, though a launch alongside Gemini for Home in the fall seems likely. We\u2019d expect to see an updated smart display before long too, since Google hasn\u2019t updated its Nest Hub line since 2021, and we\u2019ve already found that Amazon\u2019s new Alexa Plus works best on devices with screens.\n\nFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.",

      "text": "Google\u2019s annual hardware event kicked off today. It seemed like pretty much everything was announced an hour early, but we\u2019ll cover any additional news from the event below. In the meantime, check out some highlights of what we\u2019ve already posted:\nRead below for all of the news and updates from Made by Google 2025.\nGoogle reveals it isn\u2019t making tablets, smart rings, flip phones, or glasses (yet)\nGoogle\u2019s new Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Pixel Watch 4 may compete with Samsung, but it\u2019s happy to let Samsung explore other parts of the Galaxy on its own. In interviews with Bloomberg, Google just revealed a lot of devices it isn\u2019t currently working on. Here\u2019s Bloomberg:\nPretty sure that\u2019s the first true confirmation that the Pixel Tablet 2 was canceled! Remember when Google was done with tablets in 2019?\nRead Article >How Google\u2019s new Pixel 10 compares to the last-gen Pixel 9\nGoogle on Wednesday introduced its new Pixel 10 lineup during an event in New York \u2013 complete with a very strange keynote. In case you missed it, there are a lot of similarities across the latest Pixel models \u2014 and some key additions \u2014 including the MagSafe-style Pixelsnap, Google\u2019s new Tensor G5 chip, and a proactive AI feature known as Magic Cue.\nWhile Google\u2019s Pro models come loaded with the most advanced tech, the base Pixel 10 looks like the sleeper hit. Starting at $799, it\u2019s the most affordable of the bunch, and for the first time, it adds a telephoto lens to the standard Pixel. For anyone weighing an upgrade, the real question is how the base Pixel 10 stacks up against last year\u2019s Pixel 9.\nRead Article >The Made by Google event felt like being sucked into an episode of Wandavision\nFor the past twenty years or so, I\u2019ve had a clear image of what a product launch keynote is supposed to be like. A charismatic executive walks across the stage, points to some animations and pre-taped clips, a live demo or two happens, and the crowd goes wild. Clips proliferate on social media and cue the online discourse. You can trace it back to Steve Jobs dressed in a black turtleneck, with a glint in his eye, walking across a stage, asking if a hyped-up audience is ready for one more thing. So iconic was that format, it\u2019s been the blueprint for nearly every tech keynote since.\nToday\u2019s Made by Google event was decidedly not that.\nRead Article >- The Pixel Pro 10 phones include a certified Thread radio.\nThis means you should be able to use them to set up and pair Matter-over-Thread smart home devices, even if you don\u2019t have a Thread Border Router.\nApple\u2019s newer Pro iPhones also support Thread, and while the Pixel 9 series has the hardware, it looks like only the Pixel 10 Pro line is officially certified.\nIf you need to catch up on what Thread is, listen to the latest Vergecast for a deep dive.\nThe best new features of the Pixel 10 lineup\nGoogle has officially announced the Pixel 10 lineup, and there\u2019s a lot to dig into. Like last year, there are four devices \u2014 the Pixel 10, the Pixel 10 Pro, the Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold \u2014 and the phones have some nice improvements and new features that might be worth the upgrade.\nHere are some of the best new features for Google\u2019s new phones.\nRead Article >Google says the quiet part out loud: IP68 protection doesn\u2019t last\nNo phone is waterproof. No phone is dustproof. Your phone\u2019s sealants wear away over time; when they\u2019re exposed to salt or chlorine in your swimming water; or when they\u2019re dropped, dented, or cracked. Your warranty doesn\u2019t cover liquid damage; if companies find water in an IP68 phone, it\u2019s proof you damaged it!\nBut while these things are all true of every manufacturer in my reporting, I\u2019ve never seen a company proactively say them out loud like Google just did in advertising materials.\nRead Article >The magnets are the coolest thing about the Pixel 10\nQi2 is good because magnets are good.\nIf you\u2019re gonna preserve food in metal cans, you should probably have a way to open them up again. And if you\u2019re going to rely on induction coils to transfer electricity, you gotta make sure they line up right. It took almost half a century after the invention of canning for someone to invent the can opener, so I guess it\u2019s not too bad it only took eight years for Apple to slap a ring of magnets around a Qi charging coil. And it only took five years after that for Google to put that ring of magnets on a Pixel phone.\nRead Article >Here\u2019s everything you need to know about preordering the new Google Pixel phones\nGoogle announced its entire Pixel 10 generation of phones at a jam-packed Made for Google event this week. The familiar four-phone lineup includes the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. All of them have received processor bumps and other technical improvements, along with a commitment by Google to provide seven years of operating system updates. Naturally, there are some new AI features, too.\nThe Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL start at $799, $999, and $1,199, respectively, and begin shipping on August 28th. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold, meanwhile, starts at $1,799 and launches on October 9th. If you\u2019re confused about what makes each phone tick or which to choose, we\u2019ve broken everything down, along with preorder information if you decide to pick one up.\nRead Article >- Is that a new Nest smart speaker I spy?\nWhat was that gadget F1 driver Lando Norris was talking to during his skit at the Made By Google event? It definitely wasn\u2019t a Nest Wifi or Nest Mini.\nLooks like Google may have just teased some upcoming Google Nest hardware, likely powered by its new Gemini for Home voice assistant announced today.\nHow Google\u2019s new Pixel 10 phones compare to one another on paper\nAt its latest Made by Google event, the search giant officially revealed four new phones: the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. That\u2019s a lot of devices, especially when you consider the different colors and storage configurations. And we can\u2019t forget about the Pixel 9A from April, which remains our go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone.\nIf you\u2019re staring at the new Pixel 10 lineup and wondering which one actually deserves a spot in your pocket, we have you covered. All four include Google\u2019s new Pixelsnap magnetic tech, a Tensor G5 chip, and seven years of software updates, but they differ in key ways, too. Whether you\u2019re on a budget, want the most advanced camera system available, or are curious about switching to a foldable, there\u2019s an option for everyone.\nRead Article >- Did Rick Osterloh just take a shot at Apple?\nGoogle\u2019s head of devices and services said there have been \u201ca lot of broken promises\u201d when it comes to putting AI in phones, seemingly alluding to the delayed launch of Apple\u2019s AI-upgraded Siri. \u201cGemini is the real deal,\u201d Osterloh said.\n- Jimmy Fallon says this event is like a Taylor Swift album for nerds.\nHe then launched into a laundry list of celebrity guests including Steph Curry, the Jonas Brothers, and more professional athletes who I have never heard of. Right now, Rick Osterloh is being interviewed like he\u2019s a guest on the Late Show.\n- The Pixel 10 launch event is starting!\nGet ready to see a whole bunch of new devices.\nGemini for Home is Google\u2019s biggest smart home play in years\nIt\u2019s finally happening: Google Assistant in the home is getting its Gemini glow-up. \u201cGemini for Home\u201d is an all-new voice assistant for Google Home, set to arrive later this year, the company announced today.\nThis new voice assistant, powered by Google\u2019s Gemini artificial intelligence, will eventually replace Google Assistant on Google\u2019s Nest smart speakers and displays for hands-free control of things like smart lights, music, setting timers, and answering questions. Rollout begins in October through an early access program, with both free and paid tiers available. Google says you\u2019ll still summon the assistant with \u201cHey Google,\u201d and it will work across all your home devices and for every member of your household, as well as visitors.\nRead Article >- I caught all the Verge alumni pokemon.\nThere\u2019s a rare Dieter Bohn and Dan Seifert, plus a shiny Phil Esposito and an evolved Chris Welch. We\u2019re being told to take our seats ahead of the Made By Google presentation.\nHere\u2019s where you can preorder Google\u2019s upcoming Pixel Watch 4\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel phone lineup isn\u2019t the only thing getting an upgrade in the coming weeks. The company also took the time during its recent Made by Google event to introduce the forthcoming Pixel Watch 4, which starts at $349 and hits shelves on October 9th. Thankfully, if you\u2019re looking to secure one at launch, you can already preorder the Pixel Watch 3 successor from Google, Amazon, and Best Buy.\nThe redesigned Pixel Watch 4 sports a new domed \u201cActua 360\u201d display with slimmer bezels and noticeably more screen real estate. It\u2019s twice as bright as last year\u2019s Pixel Watch 3, too, with 3,000 nits of peak brightness. Google added a side-mounted charger, which, as my colleague Victoria Song noted in her hands-on impressions, turns your watch into a little display that showcases the battery percentage, your next alarm, and other info. And, in a very welcome improvement, both the display and the battery are now replaceable (and repairable).\nRead Article >- Everything was just announced an hour before Google\u2019s event starts.\nThe Made by Google 2025 event starts at 1 p.m. ET, and all the news is out now. I wonder what we\u2019ll learn in an hour.\nGoogle is launching its first magnetic wireless charging accessories\nWith its new Pixel 10 Series, Google is finally embracing the Qi2 wireless charging standard, making it much easier to securely attach wireless chargers thanks to a ring of magnets built into the device. That also makes the new phone compatible with the many MagSafe and Qi2 accessories already on the market \u2014 so naturally, Google is introducing its own options, too.\nThe $39.99 Pixelsnap Charger is a wireless charging puck that looks similar to Apple\u2019s own MagSafe charger and is compatible with other Qi2-certified devices. It supports wireless charging speeds up to 25W when paired with the Pixel 10 Pro XL and can be purchased with an optional stand accessory (as part of a $69.99 bundle) that\u2019s sturdy enough to support the Pixel 10 Pro Fold while it\u2019s unfolded and allows the charging puck to be detached as needed.\nRead Article >Google Pixel 10 launch event: the 8 biggest announcements\nGoogle has just announced a bunch of shiny new devices to look at and AI features to yell about. As part of its Made by Google event, the company revealed an upgraded Pixel 10 lineup, a bubblier smartwatch with a brighter screen, and a ton of AI updates that extend across all of its new devices.\nHere\u2019s everything that was announced at the Made by Google 2025 event.\nRead Article >The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first fully dust-resistant foldable\nFinally, a foldable to take to the beach. The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is official, matching last year\u2019s starting MSRP of $1,799, and it comes with an IP68 rating. That means full water and dust resistance, which is something that no other foldable maker has figured out yet \u2014 and no small feat for a device with moving parts.\nThe 10 Pro Fold uses a new hinge with a gear-less design that Google says provides better protection against drops. It certainly feels sturdy, though it didn\u2019t feel overly stiff when I unfolded and folded the phone back up again. The crease on the inner screen doesn\u2019t look any more prominent to my eye, but I\u2019m not usually bothered by the crease anyway.\nRead Article >Google\u2019s Pixel Buds Pro 2 are getting new AI-powered features in September\nGoogle just announced its new budget Pixel Buds 2A, but it didn\u2019t forget about the earbuds it launched last fall. Owners of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 will get an update in September that will deliver a few new AI-powered features.\nOne of them, Adaptive Audio, automatically adjusts the volume based on the noise in your environment. Google\u2019s also improving the audio processing to reduce background noise when interacting with Gemini Live. Pro 2 owners will be able to pick up calls and reply to texts hands-free by nodding or shaking their head. A new Loud Noise Protection feature, in which the buds automatically dampen sound when loud noises like sirens or alarms are detected, is also coming.\nRead Article >Fitbit\u2019s AI health coach is the first I might actually be interested in\nI\u2019m not a fan of AI health and fitness features. Not only do they regurgitate Captain Obvious-level summaries of what you just did, but the \u201cinsights\u201d are so generalized that a Google search is often more helpful. So it was with great skepticism that I walked into a demo to learn about Fitbit\u2019s forthcoming AI-powered personal health coach. To my surprise, I left cautiously curious about where Fitbit is going.\n\u201cWe really want to move towards this world of coaching,\u201d Andy Abramson, Google\u2019s director of product management for Fitbit and Health, says during a demo of the feature. Professional athletes have a whole team of people helping to craft their fitness regimens. \u201cWe asked ourselves, what if everyone could have something like this?\u201d\nRead Article >Google\u2019s Pixel Watch 4 has big ideas \u2014 and an even bigger focus on AI\nThe original Pixel Watch was late to the game. For years, there had been rumors of a Google smartwatch that never materialized. Then, when it finally arrived, it was a quintessential first-gen device, with thicc bezels, dismal battery life, and a host of quirks that needed ironing out. My DMs were full of people wondering when the watch would be unceremoniously dumped into Google\u2019s infamous product graveyard. A part of me wondered if Google was going to spend the next decade playing catch-up.\nFast forward to 2025, and I\u2019m holding the Pixel Watch 4 at Google\u2019s office in New York City. On the surface (and my wrist), it doesn\u2019t look like much has changed. But after fiddling with a few menus, watching some demos, and talking over the updates, it\u2019s evident that Google has a clear vision about where smartwatches are going.\nRead Article >The newest Pixels put generative AI right inside the camera\nAt The Verge, we like to ask \u201cWhat is a photo?\u201d when we\u2019re trying to sort out real and unreal images \u2014 especially those taken with phone cameras. But I think there\u2019s another question that we\u2019ll want to add to the mix starting right now: what is a camera? With the introduction of the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL, that answer is more wild and complicated than ever, because generative AI isn\u2019t just something you can use to edit a photo you\u2019ve already taken; it\u2019s baked right into the camera itself.\nI\u2019m talking about Pro Res Zoom, which is not to be confused with Apple\u2019s ProRes video format or Google\u2019s Super Res Zoom, so help us all. Pro Res Zoom kicks in when past 30x, all the way up to 100x digital zoom. Typically, the camera uses an algorithm to help fill in the gaps left by upscaling a small portion of your photo to the original resolution. Typically, the results look like hot garbage, especially when you get all the way to 75x or 100x, despite every camera maker\u2019s best efforts over the past two decades. Pro Res Zoom aims to give you a usable image where you wouldn\u2019t have gotten one before \u2014 and that\u2019s where the diffusion model comes in.\nRead Article >The Google Pixel 10 and 10 Pro come with magnets, a new chip, and AI everywhere\nGoogle has formally announced the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL, and their hardware upgrades can be summed up in two letter/number combinations: G5 and Qi2. Otherwise, there\u2019s not much to see on the outside of the phones. They mostly cost the same as last year\u2019s devices \u2014 $799 for the Pixel 10, $999 for the 10 Pro, and $1,199 for the 256GB 10 Pro XL, though Google got rid of the cheaper 128GB Pro XL variant. They also look an awful lot like last year\u2019s phones, with a few specs tweaked here and there. But we got a look at some of the new features running on these phones, including \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a bunch of AI stuff, and there\u2019s just a whole lot more going on than meets the eye.\nBut let\u2019s start with those top-line updates. In each of these phones is the new Tensor G5 chipset, the first one made by TSMC after four generations of Samsung-made, Google-customized silicon. Google says the CPU is on average 34 percent faster than Tensor G4\u2019s, and claims a 60 percent performance increase for on-device AI tasks handled by the TPU. On-device AI is a real theme across the Pixel 10\u2019s new features, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute.\nRead Article >\nMost Popular\n- Google says the quiet part out loud: IP68 protection doesn\u2019t last\n- Gemini for Home is Google\u2019s biggest smart home play in years\n- How Google\u2019s new Pixel 10 compares to the last-gen Pixel 9\n- The best new features of the Pixel 10 lineup\n- The Made by Google event felt like being sucked into an episode of Wandavision"

      "text": "After Google forgot to remove its unannounced Home Speaker from its launch video yesterday, we\u2019ve been able to secure more details about this unannounced speaker.\nAs you probably have figured out already, this speaker is going to be powered by Gemini. This should come as no surprise since Gemini is currently replacing the Google Assistant virtually everywhere.\nWe have seen additional images of what the speaker looks like, other than what Google left in its video yesterday, and know that it will come in four colors. This includes bright red, a light green, black, and porcelain. We\u2019d expect the names to be Obsidian, Porcelain, and Jade; the red color we\u2019re unsure of.\nIt actually looks like a fatter Apple HomePod Mini. And instead of the light being on the top, it\u2019s actually on the bottom, like many of the Amazon Echo Dots have had. There is a light that is around the entire bottom of the speaker, and it will likely light up when you are interacting with Gemini. And it has a fabric finish, much like the Nest Mini and HomePod Mini.\nSome of Gemini\u2019s most iconic features are included\nGoogle has released some pretty incredible features for Gemini over the past couple of years, including Gemini Live, which will be available on this speaker. Now it won\u2019t be as good as it is on your phone, since it does not have a camera or screen, and is not portable, so you won\u2019t be able to carry it around to talk to Gemini. But you can still have conversations with Gemini, maybe ask how traffic is on the way to work, and if you have time to stop by Starbucks.\nGemini will also have new natural voices on this speaker, and you can use Gemini to search for media and music. Gemini can set up automations with you, making your smart home even more efficient. It can also sense when you\u2019re away. So the speaker is able to detect unusual sounds, like glass breaking or your smoke alarm going off, and it can send an alert to your phone or tablet to let you know.\nA feature that Google is borrowing from the HomePod here is, the ability to pair the Home Speaker with a Google TV Streamer, giving you cinematic sound all around the house. This would bring spatial surround-sound to your living room.\nAnd finally, the Google Home Speaker will also double as a hub with support for Matter. This should replace your existing Google Home devices, when it does get announced.\nWhen will the Home Speaker be announced?\nSince Google had the speaker in part of its event yesterday announcing the Pixel 10, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2a, it must be very close to release. However, we don\u2019t know exactly when that might be. I would expect it to launch by the end of October, or Google will hold it off until next year, potentially in a Spring release with the Pixel 10a. After October, companies will be focused on the holiday season, not introducing new products."

      "text": "It\u2019s finally happening: Google Assistant in the home is getting its Gemini glow-up. \u201cGemini for Home\u201d is an all-new voice assistant for Google Home, set to arrive later this year, the company announced today.\nGemini for Home is Google\u2019s biggest smart home play in years\nThe all-new, more powerful assistant will arrive on Nest smart speakers and displays later this year.\nThe all-new, more powerful assistant will arrive on Nest smart speakers and displays later this year.\nThis new voice assistant, powered by Google\u2019s Gemini artificial intelligence, will eventually replace Google Assistant on Google\u2019s Nest smart speakers and displays for hands-free control of things like smart lights, music, setting timers, and answering questions. Rollout begins in October through an early access program, with both free and paid tiers available. Google says you\u2019ll still summon the assistant with \u201cHey Google,\u201d and it will work across all your home devices and for every member of your household, as well as visitors.\nGoogle\u2019s timing here is interesting. While the company has been leading the charge in AI on mobile, bringing a smarter, LLM-powered assistant to phones, it\u2019s lagged behind in the home. Amazon\u2019s generative-AI-powered Alexa Plus assistant is already in millions of households.\nBy comparison, Google\u2019s recent Gemini upgrades for the home have felt incremental \u2014 new voices, some more conversational responses, AI-powered features for Nest cameras and automations, and a Gemini option on some speakers. These were all hints at what was coming, but they stopped short of a whole new assistant.\nGemini for Home is that whole new voice assistant, and it could be one of the most significant changes for Google Home since the launch of its first smart display more than six years ago.\nAccording to a blog post by Anish Kattukaran, chief product officer of Google Home and Nest, using Gemini for Home will \u201cfeel fundamentally new.\u201d He says the new voice assistant leverages the \u201cadvanced reasoning, inference and search capabilities\u201d of Google\u2019s AI models, along with adaptations for the home that allow for more natural interactions to complete more complex tasks. In short, it should be an assistant that can better understand context, nuance, and intention \u2014 a complete change from its predecessor.\nWith the launch of Gemini for Home, the race is now on for the most reliable and capable smart home assistant\nFor example, Kattukaran says Gemini for Home can accurately respond to requests like \u201cturn off the lights everywhere except my bedroom,\u201d \u201cplay that song from this year\u2019s summer blockbuster about race cars,\u201d or \u201cset a timer for perfectly blanched broccoli.\u201d It will also create lists, calendar entries, and reminders more easily than before, he says.\nAnother big upgrade is that Gemini Live will be part of Gemini for Home, bringing more conversational back-and-forth voice interactions to Google Home without needing to repeatedly say \u201cHey Google.\u201d Kattukaran says this will allow for more detailed and personalized help \u2014 from cooking (\u201cI have spinach, eggs, cream cheese, and smoked salmon in the fridge. Help me make a delicious meal\u201d) to brainstorming how to buy a new car or figuring out how to fix your dishwasher, as well as more creative tasks like generating bedtime stories.\nIf this sounds familiar, it should. These are features Alexa Plus offers, including better smart home control, more help in the kitchen, and fixing household issues. Alexa Plus also has some agentic capabilities \u2014 it can use services like Thumbtack and OpenTable for you. With the launch of Gemini for Home, the race is now on for the most reliable and capable smart home voice assistant \u2014 and we\u2019re still waiting for the third competitor, Apple, to get on the track.\nGoogle hasn\u2019t announced pricing for the paid tier of Gemini for Home, but Gemini Live, with its more advanced capabilities, is a likely candidate for a premium plan. Amazon has gone the subscription route with Alexa Plus, bundling it into its Prime subscription. Google may follow suit and bundle it into its Nest Aware or Google One plans. It recently increased the price of Nest Aware to $10 a month with no major feature upgrades.\nIt\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see new Google Nest hardware this fall\nAlthough Google says Gemini for Home is coming in October, don\u2019t expect it to land everywhere all at once. Google uses its Google Home Public Preview program to test its new features, and has gated access for some Gemini features in the past, only making them available to select users. A cautious rollout is likely, mirroring Amazon\u2019s approach with Alexa Plus. Bringing generative AI into the smart home requires extra caution, especially considering there\u2019s the potential to control critical devices like locks, appliances, and HVAC systems.\nAll of this, of course, raises an ongoing question for Google Home: Where is the hardware? Aside from the Pixel Tablet, Google hasn\u2019t refreshed its smart speakers or displays since 2021. With Gemini for Home being a major upgrade for Google Home, it\u2019s likely that new hardware designed to showcase its capabilities will launch alongside it this fall."

      "text": "Google I/O is a couple of days away and, with it, the likely launch of the Pixel Tablet. By itself, the device is just another Android tablet, but when it\u2019s connected to its charging dock, which has built-in speakers, it looks an awful lot like the Nest Hub Max. Like the Nest Hub Max, it can act as a smart home controller \u2014 and I sure hope it paves the way for a better smart home interface. It had better.\nIt\u2019s time for Google to fix the Nest Hub\nThe Nest Hub interface is old and increasingly broken. But there are hints of something new on the way, and I don\u2019t just mean the Pixel Tablet.\nThe Nest Hub interface is old and increasingly broken. But there are hints of something new on the way, and I don\u2019t just mean the Pixel Tablet.\nThe Nest Hub exemplifies everything that\u2019s gone wrong with smart home controls: its interface is unintuitive and inflexible, its responses are laggy, and its responses are unpredictable and often just plain wrong.\nGoogle seems to be using the Pixel Tablet as a chance for a do-over. The Pixel Tablet will run Android, and from what we\u2019ve seen so far, it lets you control your smart home directly from the Google Home app, just like you can on any other tablet or smartphone. That\u2019s great for people who buy the Pixel Tablet; the Home app is much more powerful than the Nest Hub interface, and the updated version that\u2019s been in public preview since November comes with powerful new features and increased flexibility.\nIt\u2019s clear that Google is gearing up for a big overhaul of the Google Home ecosystem. And no part of the ecosystem needs it more than the dilapidated, half-busted Nest Hub interface.\nIt won\u2019t be easy.\nThe trouble with the Nest Hub (abridged)\nLet\u2019s back up. Right now, Google sells two touchscreen smart displays: the Nest Hub Max, released in 2019, and the second-gen Nest Hub, from 2021. It also still supports the 2018 Nest Hub. All three run the same interface, which has always been a little bit janky but has become increasingly busted as Google adds features and removes others.\nThe Nest Hubs have touchscreens, which makes you feel like you ought to be able to interact with them like you would a tablet. But as my colleague Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, The Verge\u2019s resident smart home expert, says, smart displays are really just smart speakers that can show you things: pictures of your kids, YouTube videos, your home cameras, the weather, etc.\nIt\u2019s nice that they have screens. The fact that they have touchscreens is misleading, though: it\u2019s nearly always faster and easier to talk to them than to use the touch interface, and you\u2019re more likely to get the results you want.\nFor the Nest Hub, part of that is down to the design of the interface, which hasn\u2019t meaningfully changed since 2020. The main screen has a series of tabs along the top, and each tab has a bunch of cards on it. There\u2019s an overview page, a home control page, one for media, one for communication, and so forth. But since they have to be large enough to be seen from across the room, the information density is incredibly low, which means lots of swipes and taps to get to anything you might want to do.\nEven if you can manage to navigate the interface to find the thing you want to do, there\u2019s no guarantee the Nest Hub will actually make it happen. Instead of being hard-coded to do the thing you expect them to do, most interface elements send a simulated voice command, which it is up to Google Assistant to parse in real time, based on who\u2019s asking.\nFor example, the Nest Hub has a thing that looks like an app drawer, which was added in 2021, and in that drawer is a Games icon (for now). If my editor, Dan Seifert, presses the icon on his Nest Hub Max, it opens the Games pane, which is what it\u2019s supposed to do. If I press Games on my Nest Hub Max, it pulls up the video feed from the Nest cam in my game room, which happens to be named Game Cam. The button does not know what it is supposed to do.\nAnother example: half the time, the Nest Hub Max can\u2019t hear me say \u201cHey Google\u201d unless I raise my voice. There\u2019s a slider in the Google Home app labeled \u201cHey Google\u201d sensitivity. When I increased it by one level on my phone, the Nest Hub Max recited the definition of sensitivity \u2014 exactly as if I had said \u201cHey Google, sensitivity.\u201d I do not know if it actually changed the mic sensitivity.\nGoogle built Duo video calling into the Nest Hub Max, and then it merged Duo with Meet and forgot to tell the Nest Hub, which still has a Duo icon. When I tap my wife\u2019s name in Household Contacts and select video call, the Nest Hub doesn\u2019t know how. Earlier, I asked it to call me by tapping my own profile picture, and it dialed a completely different Nathan Edwards \u2014 one of the many guys with my name I have never met but have in my contacts because I get emails intended for them. Just now, I launched Duo from the icon. The Assistant asked, \u201cWho do you want to call?\u201d I said, \u201cMe,\u201d hoping it would send a video call to my phone. Instead, it pulled up a list of Spotify albums and playlists called \u201cme.\u201d\nAnother big issue here is that you cannot meaningfully customize the interface, either on the device or in the Google Home app. The only way to reorder rooms and devices is to rename them so they show up earlier in the alphabet. Google has finally fixed this in the public preview of the Home app, which allows you to add devices and groups as favorites and \u2014 as of a couple weeks ago \u2014 reorder them. That option has yet to appear on the Nest Hub.\nWhen Google was pushing games on the Nest Hub, the interface was full of tiles advertising games like Feed My Fish or Baby Shark Stories. I couldn\u2019t dismiss them. I couldn\u2019t even move the tiles further to the right. There was nowhere in the settings where I could disable them, nowhere in the content filters to change them, etc. You could disable news, disable videos, and disable music, but there was no option to disable games.\nNow that games are (thankfully) being deprecated, Google has put a News tile on my interface. Because I live in America, the News tile usually shows either celebrity nonsense or headlines about people getting shot and killed. I cannot change the sources for this News tile, and I cannot get it off of my interface.\nBecause of the Nest Hub Max\u2019s limited processing power, the fact that it\u2019s not really designed for touch, and the fact that it has to support multiple users, you have to use the Google Home app on a phone or tablet in order to change most of its settings anyway, and it\u2019s far from clear where any given option lives. Is it in user account settings? Device settings? Assistant settings? Home settings? Nobody knows.\nTake that News tile: I can open Google Home on my phone and tap the card for the Nest Hub Max. From there, I go to Notifications & Digital Wellbeing > Digital Wellbeing > Filters > Nest Hub Max (again) > News & Podcasts and tap Block news. This blocks audio news programs but doesn\u2019t do anything about the News card.\nIn order to set up meaningful parental controls \u2014 which Google introduced in November 2022, more than three years after I got my Nest Hub Max \u2014 I had to create Google accounts for my elementary-aged children and teach the Nest Hub Max to recognize their faces and voices. Enabling parental controls and downtime doesn\u2019t remove unavailable options from the Nest Hub Max. It just means that I heard \u201cHey Google, play Baby Shark Stories\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t do that while content restrictions are on\u201d five hundred times a week until my kids forgot about it.\nThere\u2019s also a \u201cmeditations to try\u201d tile in case I need to calm down. I\u2019m very calm. Calmer\u2019n you are, dude.\nI could go on.\nNow is the time for Google to fix its smart home interface\nWe know the Pixel Tablet runs Android, and we know that the Google Home app is getting an overhaul, which means the tablet will be far better positioned to do all the things I wish the Nest Hub did better. And from what we\u2019ve seen in previews, the updated Home app itself solves most of my gripes with the Nest Hub interface \u2014 for people who buy the Pixel Tablet.\nBut the Nest Hubs aren\u2019t going anywhere. Unless the Pixel Tablet has a secret Nest speaker in its charging dock \u2014 which, to be clear, would rule \u2014 you\u2019ll still need a separate Matter controller and Thread border router for your smart home. All the Nest Hubs are Matter controllers, and the second-gen Hub and the Hub Max are also Thread border routers. While Google has other speakers and mesh nodes with Matter controllers (and exactly one other that\u2019s also a Thread border router, the Nest Pro Wi-Fi), it\u2019s unlikely to kill its existing smart displays just because it\u2019s launching a new tablet.\nThis is the first I/O since Google incorporated Matter into Google Home, and I would be shocked if Google didn\u2019t mention anything about it. If Google does launch the Pixel Tablet, it\u2019s likely to bring the Google Home app update out of public preview and maybe even launch the script editor at the same time. With a new tablet, a new Home app, and a new Matter focus, it\u2019d be deeply odd to leave the Nest Hub in its current janky state.\nThere\u2019s reason to be optimistic. Google has spent the last two years replacing the Nest Hub operating system with Fuchsia OS: the first-gen Nest Hub got it in 2021, the Nest Hub Max in 2022, and the second-gen Nest Hub in May 2023. That means all three Nest Hubs will be running the same code base for the first time in two years, just before Google I/O. Why put in all that work without changing the interface? We\u2019ve been wondering for two years. It could explain (but not excuse) the apparent neglect; why fix something that\u2019s about to be replaced?\nThe groundwork is there. They\u2019ve got to do something.\nIt\u2019s a great time for a fresh start."

      "text": "With this week\u2019s announcement that the smart home standard Matter has finally launched and the possibility that we could see Matter devices arriving any day now, I wanted to round up answers to some of the most common questions I\u2019ve heard in the last few days.\nIf you have no idea what Matter is, my explainer on Matter is the place to start. But if you have more specific questions, the answers should be here. If you just want to know what devices will work with Matter, we\u2019ve covered that in another blog, which we\u2019ll update as new products get announced.\nThere\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about Matter, and we won\u2019t know until we get Matter-enabled products in our homes and the apps and ecosystems are updated. But there are plenty of things we do know, as well as some stuff we can speculate on.\nLast week, I attended the CEDIA Expo, where I hosted a panel on Matter and interviewed representatives from Google, the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA), Yale, and Z-Wave, many of whom have been involved with Matter from the beginning. I posed these questions to them, as well as researched answers from published materials to help you understand what the launch of Matter means to your smart home today.\nWhy do we need Matter?\nMatter is a new language for smart home devices. Once your smart door lock can easily talk to your smart speaker or your smart light switch can communicate smoothly with your thermostat, the hope is that the connected home will become less complicated.\n\u201cOver the last 10 years, there has been an organic growth of the smart home that\u2019s created a lot of challenges,\u201d says Kevin Po of Google Nest. \u201cOne of those is that these devices can\u2019t all speak the same language. With Matter, we have a chance to get them all talking the same language.\u201d\nMatter is like hitting a big reset button for the smart home, laying a foundation from which a smarter, more interoperable home can grow.\nThere are already so many smart home protocols. Why do we need another one?\nWhile, technically, Matter is a smart home interoperability protocol, it\u2019s not an entirely new protocol. Matter is an application layer over existing protocols Wi-Fi and Thread. It\u2019s open source, not proprietary, and it works over your local network, so it doesn\u2019t rely on the cloud.\nWith Matter, instead of using two or three separate apps and connecting their cloud service back-ends to get your smart plug to turn on your lamp when you unlock your front door, that plug and lock can chat directly with each other, and you can set up the automation using one Matter Controller app.\nMatter is not replacing existing protocols. Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Z-Wave will still be part of smart homes (and Bluetooth LE is used for adding devices to Matter). Any smart home gadgets you have that use these technologies should be able to be bridged into Matter (more on this in a bit).\nWhy are all these competitors on board? What\u2019s in it for them?\nMatter was developed initially by a number of big companies in the tech space, including Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung SmartThings, and Comcast. There are now over 280 companies on board \u2014 the list is like a who\u2019s who of IoT. But why did they all decide to work together?\nThe smart home wasn\u2019t developing the way many had hoped. There were major pain points that were making it hard to grow and expand. Reliability, connectivity, setup, and \u201cthe multi-platform problem\u201d were the key areas Michele Turner of Google identified in my interview with her earlier this year. The early promise of seemingly limitless growth had faded in the face of complexity and user frustration. The big tech companies and the hundreds of IoT device manufacturers saw this bottleneck and realized they needed to work together.\nYou can ask Siri to control your Nest thermostat and turn on your Fire TV \u2014 if you live in that kind of crazy, Frankensteinian home\nSince I started to cover Matter, I have heard the phrase \u201ca rising tide lifts all boats\u201d repeatedly. Once the smart home is easier to set up and use, there will be more people buying devices, which is something every company wants to see.\nWill Matter mean there are more smart home devices?\nBefore Matter, device makers had to either pick a protocol to work over or develop several different models or integrations to give customers choice. This was harder and more expensive for them and wildly confusing for us.\nKevin Kraus of lock manufacturer Yale told me, \u201cWe\u2019ve developed over a dozen modules for different platforms to make our locks work with them. The promise of Matter is I only have to create one module.\u201d\nHe points out there are plenty of companies that today only make a product for Z-Wave or Zigbee or Bluetooth because it costs them too much to try and diversify. Now, all those manufacturers will have the option to pick one protocol that is intended to work with every platform. \u201cIf Matter delivers on that promise, that goes a huge way to solving that problem and bringing many more manufacturers into the fold,\u201d he says.\nEve, for example, chose to work just with Apple HomeKit, developing only Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices for that platform. With Matter, the company plans to expand to more platforms.\nThe downside is Matter will only work with a small number of device categories at launch. These are smart light bulbs and fixtures, smart plugs and switches, smart thermostats and other HVAC controls, smart shades, smart sensors, connected locks, and media devices, including TVs.\nBut the CSA is already working on new device types, including security cameras and robot vacuums. \u201cThis is just Matter 1.0,\u201d says Michelle Mindala-Freeman of the CSA. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole backlog of things \u2014 device types, capabilities \u2014 that [is being] worked on for subsequent releases.\u201d\nIf Matter uses Wi-Fi, does that mean my entire home is now on the internet?\nNo. Matter uses local networks in your home \u2014 Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Thread (Thread is an IP- and mesh-based protocol) \u2014 and works entirely locally. Nothing is going to the internet or \u201cthe cloud\u201d unless you use a Matter Controller or device app that talks to the cloud. The main reason to do this will be for controlling your home remotely when you are away or for connecting to cloud-based services, such as music streaming or voice assistants.\nSecurity is part of the Matter SDK, as well as data privacy principles. The CSA has published a white paper that goes into specific details, but the concept is built around trusted devices, trusted controllers, and private communication.\nWhat is a Matter Controller?\nA Matter Controller is how you control Matter devices in your home. It\u2019s the brains of the system. Like a Thread border router, controller functionality can be built into many devices, and you can have multiple controllers.\nWe already know that devices like Amazon Echo and Nest Hub speakers and smart displays will be controllers. Controllers can also be Thread border routers, but they don\u2019t have to be.\nA Matter controller can also be a bridge or hub; Samsung\u2019s SmartThings hubs, TVs, and appliances will be controllers, as will Apple\u2019s HomePod Mini. It\u2019s also possible that bridges and hubs from manufacturers like Philips Hue and Aqara could be controllers (Aqara has said it will update its M1S and M2 hubs to Matter).\nFinally, Matter-enabled smartphone apps \u2014 such as Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, or Samsung SmartThings \u2014 are also controllers. These will be where you set up routines and automations in your smart home. The companies listed have all said their apps will be Matter Controllers, but there will likely be many more options.\nWill I need a bridge or a hub to run Matter?\nMatter doesn\u2019t require a central bridge or hub. Instead, it allows devices to talk directly to each other \u2014 either over Wi-Fi or Thread \u2014 which are then managed by a Matter Controller.\nThread devices do require a Thread border router to route communications from Thread devices to Wi-Fi devices. Thread border routers are already in a lot of common smart home devices \u2014 from Wi-Fi routers to smart speakers to smart lights \u2014 and we\u2019ll likely see more soon.\nIsn\u2019t a Thread border router just a bridge?\n\u201cWith bridges and hubs, there\u2019s a translation that happens; they see the data sent to them and then translate it from one environment to the other,\u201d says Google\u2019s Po. \u201cA router only \u2018routes\u2019 data. It doesn\u2019t translate or even see the packages it\u2019s transferring.\u201d\nThread is also a mesh network, and you can have multiple Thread border routers in your home to strengthen the network. If one stops working, another can pick up the slack. That is not currently the case if your Zigbee or Z-Wave bridge or hub stops working.\nWill my existing smart home devices get upgraded to support Matter?\nThis is going to depend on the manufacturers. Many, including Ikea, Philips Hue, Yale, Sengled, Tuya Smart, Cync, Aqara, Wiz, Wemo, Schlage, TP-Link, and Eve, have said some or all of their existing compatible products will be upgraded to Matter. How that will happen will vary depending on the device.\nIf, like Philips Hue or Aqara, the products rely on a bridge or hub, it may be possible for that device to receive an over-the-air firmware update and bring all the lights and devices connected to it into Matter. Alternatively, a company may decide to release a new bridge or gateway to bring existing devices into Matter \u2014 which is what Ikea has done.\n\u201cAn upgradeable or a new gateway that is Matter compatible will enable Z-Wave and Zigbee devices to be recognized as though they are Matter devices,\u201d says Mitchell Klein of the Z-Wave Alliance. \u201cAnd not only existing devices in people\u2019s homes but all the devices still on the store shelves and in manufacturers\u2019 warehouses.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also possible we\u2019ll see Matter bridges released that can translate communications from multiple ecosystems. Silicon Labs has developed Unify SDK, a software and hardware solution for bridging Zigbee and Z-Wave into Matter. This \u201cbridge\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be another little white box; it could be built into devices like a thermostat, says Klein. Infineon has announced several Matter SoC solutions for device makers, and other chip makers are following suit.\nSome individual devices will require hardware changes to be Matter-compatible. Eve\u2019s smart plugs and Yale\u2019s locks are two examples \u2014 Yale using swappable modules for its locks and Eve adding Thread radios to many of its devices. However, Matter works over Wi-Fi and Thread, so some products might be upgradeable with just an over-the-air update.\nAmazon and Google have said their existing smart speakers and displays will be upgraded this way, and we should hear more about other companies\u2019 plans now that the final spec is out.\nWill Matter make it easier to buy new devices?\nYes. That\u2019s sort of the whole point. If a device works with Matter, it will have the Matter logo (which looks like a stick person in bikini bottoms). That\u2019s your sign it will work in your smart home.\nThe other promise is simple setup. Matter devices will pair directly to your smartphone \u2014 no app needed, as Google demonstrated this week. Apple and Samsung have also got programs in place to enable this on their smartphones and tablets. Once the device is paired to your Matter network, then you can choose which app you want to control it through.\nDoes this mean I can just use one app to control my whole home?\nYes and no. All Matter devices will work with all controller apps \u2014 because Matter has something called multi-admin control built in. They can also be controlled by more than one controller. But devices may not have access to all their features through that app.\nFor example, at launch, Matter won\u2019t support more advanced features, like energy monitoring in a smart plug or complicated scene control for smart lights. So, if you wanted to set up energy monitoring or have your colored smart bulbs pulsate with the shades of your football team, you would need to use the devices\u2019 app or an app that supports the functionality you want. At least for now.\nCan I use non-Matter and Matter devices in the same smart home routines?\nIt depends on what each ecosystem allows, but Amazon, Apple, and Google have all publicly stated they will fully integrate with Matter. Samsung has been less clear. \u201cIn the Google Home app, Matter devices will sit alongside the ones that you\u2019ve already connected with through the Works with Google program and work together,\u201d confirms Po.\nCan I use Apple\u2019s Siri to control my (new) Nest thermostat and turn on my Amazon Fire TV?\nThe big selling point of Matter from day one has been multi-admin control \u2014 that you can use any app, any ecosystem to control any device \u2014 including with voice control using any voice assistant. But this requires each Matter Controller manufacturer to allow it.\n\u201cMatter provides common controls, but beyond that are customizations.\u201d\n\u201cIt depends on how different product manufacturers and platforms choose to integrate the Matter protocol,\u201d says Google\u2019s Po. \u201cWe\u2019re wholly committed to Matter. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re updating the [new] Nest thermostat to be a Matter device. And it will be controllable by Matter controllers if other companies choose to implement the micro-controller functionality into their devices.\u201d\nSo, if Amazon, Apple, and Google all enable this feature, then yes \u2014 you can ask Siri to control your Nest thermostat and turn on your Fire TV \u2014 if you live in that kind of crazy, Frankensteinian home. But that\u2019s still a big \u201cif.\u201d\nWill I be able to use devices in multiple ecosystems?\nThere will not be one Matter-branded app. Instead, you will pick a platform to run your Matter home on. That could be Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, or another ecosystem or app yet to be announced as a Matter Controller.\nThose companies will all compete to get you to use their apps by offering better or different experiences. \u201cMatter provides common controls, but beyond that are customizations,\u201d says Po. \u201cEcosystems will want new ways to show the benefits of their user experiences. New features built on top of Matter.\u201d This is that smarter, more interoperable home we were talking about at the beginning.\nBut because all Matter devices speak the same language, you should be able to use them in different ecosystems at the same time or switch between platforms at will. How exactly these \u201cflows\u201d will happen isn\u2019t known yet. And, if smart home companies are anything like cellular carriers, there may be roadblocks one way and lots of incentives the other way. The key point here is that you are no longer locked into one smart home ecosystem, and that can only be a good thing.\nShould I be excited or skeptical about Matter?\nBoth. Matter is a big change for the smart home that has made a lot of big promises. But it\u2019s also been a big challenge, judging by the number of delays. Mindala-Freeman of the CSA stressed to me that the original vision of Matter is still in place \u2014 in terms of how transformational it could be for the smart home. But she says there is still a lot of work to be done and that the release of Matter 1.0 is just the beginning."

      "text": "One of the best features of Amazon\u2019s new Alexa Plus is that I don\u2019t have to \u201cspeak Alexa\u201d anymore. I\u2019ve been testing the voice assistant for about a week now, and it understands what I say, regardless of how I say it \u2014 there\u2019s no more need for precise phrasing to get Alexa to do what I want. This big shift underpins another headline feature of the revamped generative AI-powered assistant that I\u2019ve been testing: agentic AI. But this one needs work.\nI tasked Alexa Plus with tackling my to-do list \u2014 it was hit or miss\nFrom booking Chris Isaak tickets to fixing my sprinkler pump, Alexa\u2019s new AI agent is ambitious but unfinished.\nI tasked Alexa Plus with tackling my to-do list \u2014 it was hit or miss\nFrom booking Chris Isaak tickets to fixing my sprinkler pump, Alexa\u2019s new AI agent is ambitious but unfinished.\nIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\nThe idea is I can talk to Alexa Plus as I would to a real personal assistant and ask it to do tasks, such as reserving a restaurant for my friend\u2019s birthday, finding an electrician to fix my broken sprinkler pump, or booking tickets to a Chris Isaak concert.\nThe assistant can then act as an \u201cAI agent\u201d and navigate online services on my behalf to book everything for me. Combined with better calendar management and the ability to remember things you tell it, Alexa\u2019s agentic AI has the potential to make the assistant much more useful.\nAlexa\u2019s AI agent features are neither broad enough nor seamless enough to replace my real-life personal assistant: me\nAt least in theory. In reality, it\u2019s too limited. Alexa Plus relies on partnerships with specific services; it can\u2019t just roam the web and do my bidding. As of now, that includes Ticketmaster, OpenTable, Uber, and Thumbtack. While impressively, Alexa did manage to complete several steps, overall, the AI agent\u2019s current features are neither broad enough nor seamless enough to replace my real-life personal assistant: me.\nAlexa Plus is still in an Early Access beta phase, and Amazon says more integrations are coming soon. These include ordering groceries by voice (via \u201cseveral grocery providers in the US\u201d), delivery through Grubhub, and booking spa visits through Vagaro.\nThese may be more useful to me, especially grocery ordering. I already use Alexa for my shopping list, but I then have to put everything into my Harris Teeter shopping app for pickup or delivery. If Alexa could take that list and add it to a service like Instacart, it would cut out a chunk of work for me.\nOf the three agentic experiences I tested, the best was booking a ticket to an event through Ticketmaster. After a dodgy start \u2014 when I asked about sports events and was told about a youth basketball training session \u2014 I tried again. \u201cWhat events are there in Charleston next month that you can buy me tickets for?\u201d\nAlexa produced a list of about 10 local sports events and concerts on the Echo Show 15 I was using (Alexa Plus is much more useful on a screened device). It told me, \u201cYou\u2019ve got music shows like Blackberry Smoke and Mike Campbell on August 5th and Collective Soul on August 6th. There\u2019s also a Cure tribute band on August 2nd. Anything catch your interest?\u201d\nI spotted a Chris Isaak concert in the list (I love a good Wicked Game) and told it to book me tickets. It found balcony seats for $98.15 each and asked how many I wanted, while also showing me more expensive options.\nI selected the cheap seats, and it walked me through each step as it added them to my cart, ending with a checkout button where my credit card details were pre-populated. (I\u2019d linked my Ticketmaster account in the Alexa app when I first set up Alexa Plus.)\nI canceled before purchasing, because I don\u2019t love a Wicked Game $200 much, and Alexa confirmed that the tickets were released. However, alarmingly, later that day, a pop-up in the Alexa app told me that anyone with access to my Alexa devices can order tickets. Amazon: I\u2019ll take a PIN option here, please.\nNext, I asked Alexa to \u201cbook a dinner for two in downtown Charleston for tomorrow night at 7PM.\u201d It returned three options, which is just sad \u2014 Charleston has a hopping foodie scene. I picked a French spot I\u2019d been to before and changed it up, asking Alexa to \u201cmake it for two weeks on Friday.\u201d Unfazed, Alexa understood, pivoted and confirmed availability for Friday, July 31st, at 7PM, then asked if I wanted to book. After I confirmed, it said it would also add the reservation to my linked Gmail calendar. Handy!\nAlexa had messed up the date\nOr so I thought. I then received a text message from OpenTable, confirming my reservation for Thursday, July 31st. Alexa had messed up the date. I told Alexa to switch the reservation to Friday, August 1st, and it did, also updating my calendar.\nWhile it eventually booked the table, Alexa took longer to do it and was less accurate than if I\u2019d just opened the OpenTable app on my phone (or more realistically, the Resy app that most restaurants in Charleston use) and done it myself.\nFinally, I had Alexa tackle a chore I\u2019ve been putting off for two years: finding an electrician. I\u2019ve been meaning to get the circuit for my sprinkler pump fixed for ages. It\u2019s on the same one as my internet router, so when the pump kicks in, it trips the circuit \u2014 and down goes my Wi-Fi.\nThe big difference is that I did all of this hands-free\nI told Alexa I needed an electrician to fix the sprinkler system, and asked if it could book one. It pulled a list of several \u201chighly rated electricians\u201d in my area via Thumbtack, highlighting the top three. I picked one and asked it to schedule a visit for a week from now. Alexa asked several follow-up questions about my house and the specific issue \u2014 it felt a bit like filling out a webform with my voice. Alexa, then said it was working on sending the request through the Thumbtack website, and that I\u2019d get updates soon.\nA few hours later, still no word from Alexa. But I received an email from Thumbtack (the first of many\u2026) and a text message from the electrician asking me to call or text to schedule an appointment. Not exactly the seamless set-it-and-forget-it experience I\u2019d hoped for.\nStill, the big difference is that I did all of this hands-free. I could be setting up dinner dates and finding electricians while cooking dinner or folding laundry. As a working mother of two, anything that helps with multitasking so I can complete my to-do list faster is welcome. But while the tech is impressive, the lack of depth and the failures I experienced in two out of my three tests mean I don\u2019t plan to rely on Alexa to do these tasks for me just yet.\nPhotography by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge"
