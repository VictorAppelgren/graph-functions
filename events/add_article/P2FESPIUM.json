      "summary": "WTI crude and gasoline futures fell sharply as market participants weighed the impact of President Trump’s new tariff regime and weaker-than‑expected U.S. payroll and ISM manufacturing data, which dampened expectations for global energy demand. The slump was compounded by a 2‑week low in the S&P 500, further eroding confidence in economic growth. Meanwhile, OPEC+ is considering pausing production hikes amid concerns of a supply glut, while Russian sanctions and potential supply disruptions add additional uncertainty to the oil market.",
