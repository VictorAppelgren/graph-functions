  "title": "Swiss Inflation Exceeds Zero for a Third Month in Relief for SNB",
  "description": "Swiss inflation stayed positive for a third consecutive month, offering reassurance to policymakers as they also evaluate if the economy can weather a jump in US ta\u2026",
  "content": "Consumer prices rose 0.2% from a year ago in August, matching the increase of the previous month, the country\u2019s statistics office said on Thursday. Most economists in a Bloomberg survey had anticipated inflation to stay at that level or accelerate.\n\nThe report marks the final glimpse of price data before the Swiss National Bank\u2019s quarterly decision later this month. Signs of some inflation may lessen pressure on officials to cut interest rates again at a time when the economy is threatened by President Donald Trump\u2019s disproportionately high US tariffs of 39%.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\nThe reading is strong enough to raise the prospect that price growth in the third quarter may end up exceeding the 0.1% average predicted by the SNB at its last policy decision in June.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, we do not see any risks of deflationary developments, and our forecasts show a jump in inflation in the coming quarters,\u201d Vice President Antoine Martin said in an interview with L\u2019Agefi published last week.\n\nAs in previous years, August proved a pivotal month for the adjustment of rents in Switzerland, helping to push up the overall index \u2014 along with clothing and footwear \u2014 to offset lower prices for holiday-related activity.\n\nOfficials will confront a finely balanced trade-off in coming weeks. They must assess if recent weakening in the franc has been enough to stoke import prices, just as Switzerland\u2019s predicament is further compounded by US tariffs.\n\nThe SNB\u2019s rate is already at zero, further complicating its decision on Sept. 25. Officials have consistently signaled that the bar to reintroducing negative borrowing costs for the first time in three years is higher than for a normal cut. Money-market pricing currently suggests the central bank will keep its policy rate steady well into next year.\n\nConsumer-price growth in the surrounding euro area remains stronger than in Switzerland and came in at 2.1% in August. Based on the European Union\u2019s harmonized measure, the Swiss inflation rate was zero in the period.",
