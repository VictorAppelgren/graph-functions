  "content": "A Chinese warship collided with one of its own coast guard vessels while chasing Philippine boats earlier this week in the highly contested South China Sea, in the latest such incident to underscore growing volatility in one of the world\u2019s most strategically vital waterways.\n\nDramatic footage released by the Philippine Coast Guard showed the moment the collision took place, leaving one of the Chinese vessels missing a prominent part of its bow.\n\nCommodore Jay Tarriela of the Philippine Coast Guard said the incident occurred on Monday while personnel were distributing aid to Filipino fishermen near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, approximately 140 miles west of the Philippine island of Luzon.\n\nTarriela said a China Coast Guard (CCG) vessel was chasing Philippine Coast Guard vessel BRP Suluan at \u201chigh speed\u201d when the incident occurred.\n\n\u201cPhilippine vessels and fishermen encountered hazardous maneuvers and blocking actions from other vessels in the vicinity,\u201d Tarriela said, adding one of the Philippine boats was targeted with a water cannon but avoided getting hit.\n\nHe added that the Chinese ship then \u201cperformed a risky maneuver\u201d which inflicted \u201csubstantial damage\u201d to the China Coast Guard vessel\u2019s forecastle, rendering the ship \u201cunseaworthy.\u201d\n\nVideos released by the Philippine Coast Guard on Monday showed People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy ship with hull number 164 , a Type 052D guided-missile destroyer, careening into the China Coast Guard vessel 3104, as both chased the much smaller BRP Suluan Philippine patrol vessel.\n\nAt least three China Coast Guard personnel can be seen on the bow of CCG 3104 at the time of impact. The Philippine Coast Guard said it immediately offered support, including assistance with man-overboard recovery and medical aid for any injured CCG crew members, according to Tarriela.\n\nChina has said a confrontation with Philippine vessels took place but has not, so far, confirmed a collision between its two vessels.\n\nChina Coast Guard spokesperson Gan Yu said in a statement that the \u201cPhilippines sent multiple coast guard and government vessels, under the pretext of delivering supplies to fishing boats, to forcibly intrude into waters\u201d near Huangyan Dao, the name China uses for the Scarborough Shoal.\n\nGan said the China Coast Guard \u201ctook all necessary measures, including tracking, monitoring, blocking, and controlling, to drive the Philippine vessels away.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn-site operations were conducted in a professional, standard, and lawful manner,\u201d Gan said, but he did not mention the high-stakes crash in open waters.\n\nThe South China Sea remains a flashpoint for territorial disputes involving China, the Philippines and several other nations.\n\nIt is a vital maritime trade corridor with an estimated third of global shipping, worth trillions of dollars, passing through each year, and home to fertile fishing grounds upon which many livelihoods depend on.\n\nConfrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels in particular have spiked in recent years, fueling fears that a major accident could spiral into a conflict between the two. The Philippines is a US treaty ally while China, which has been rapidly growing its naval fleet, is the key US rival in the region.\n\nBoth China and the Philippines claim Scarborough Shoal as well as small islands and atolls in the South China Sea.\n\nIn 2012, China seized the shoal, which lies west of the main Philippine island of Luzon, and has since restricted access to Filipino fishermen there. A ruling by an international arbitration court four years later found that most Chinese claims in the South China Sea were invalid but Beijing has refused to abide by it.\n\nMonday\u2019s confrontation marks the latest in a series of tense and dangerous incidents in recent years, as both Beijing and Manila intensify efforts to assert sovereignty over the contested reefs and maritime features.\n\nIn April, China and the Philippines each unfurled their national flags on Sandy Cay, a string of three uninhabited sandbars which lie near a Philippine military outpost in the disputed Spratly Islands.\n\nIn June 2024, the Philippines accused China\u2019s Coast Guard of launching a \u201cbrutal assault\u201d with bladed weapons during a South China Sea clash near the Second Thomas Shoal, also near the contested Spratly Islands.\n\nFootage released by the Philippine military showed Chinese coast guard officers brandishing an axe and other bladed or pointed tools at the Filipino soldiers and slashing their rubber boat, in what Manila called \u201ca brazen act of aggression.\u201d One Philippine Navy serviceman lost his right thumb when the Chinese Coast Guard vessel rammed into a smaller Philippine boat.\n\nThe frequent aggressive encounters underscore the growing volatility in the vast 1.3-million-square-mile waterway, where Beijing has spent years turning islands and reefs into military bases and airstrips.",

      "text": "The Philippines has accused China\u2019s Coast Guard of launching a \u201cbrutal assault\u201d with bladed weapons during a South China Sea clash earlier this week, a major escalation in a festering dispute that threatens to drag the United States into another global conflict.\nFootage released by the Philippine military on Thursday showed Chinese coast guard officers brandishing an axe and other bladed or pointed tools at the Filipino soldiers and slashing their rubber boat, in what Manila called \u201ca brazen act of aggression.\u201d\nThe Philippines and China have blamed each other for the confrontation near the Second Thomas Shoal in the contested Spratly Islands on Monday, which took place during a Philippine mission to resupply its soldiers stationed on a beached World War II-era warship that asserts Manila\u2019s territorial claims over the atoll.\nThe incident is the latest in a series of increasingly fraught confrontations in the resource-rich and strategically important waterway.\nBut the scenes captured in the latest footage mark an inflection point in the long-simmering tensions, with China adopting new, far more openly aggressive tactics that, analysts say, appear calculated to test how the Philippines and its key defense ally \u2013 the United States \u2013 will respond.\nChina claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Multiple governments, including Manila, hold competing claims.\nCollin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said it was unprecedented for China\u2019s maritime law enforcement to board a Philippine naval vessel.\n\u201cThey can be rubber boats, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that they are Philippine Navy vessels, and according to international law, they enjoy what we term as sovereign immunity,\u201d Koh said. \u201cThat is very dangerous, because, if anything, that could even be construed as an act of war.\u201d\nBoats \u2018looted\u2019\nAt a news conference on Wednesday, senior Philippine military officials said China\u2019s Coast Guard officers \u201cillegally boarded\u201d the Philippine rubber boats, \u201clooted\u201d seven disassembled rifles stored in gun cases, \u201cdestroyed\u201d outboard motor, communication and navigation equipment and took the personal cellphones of Filipino personnel.\n\u201cThey deliberately punctured our rubber boats using knives and other pointed tools,\u201d said Alfonso Torres Jr., commander of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Western Command.\nA Philippine Navy serviceman on the rubber boat lost his right thumb when the Chinese Coast Guard rammed it, Torres said.\nChina\u2019s Coast Guard also deployed tear gas, \u201cblinding\u201d strobe lights and continuously blared sirens, the AFP said.\n\u201cOnly pirates do this. Only pirates board, steal, and destroy ships, equipment, and belongings,\u201d Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, said in a statement.\n\u201cThe Chinese Coast Guard personnel had bladed weapons and our personnel fought with bare hands. That is what\u2019s important. We were outnumbered and their weapons were unexpected but our personnel fought with everything that they had,\u201d Brawner added.\nAt a regular briefing with reporters on Thursday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry was asked to comment on the allegations from the Philippines that their vessels were damaged by Chinese coast guard personnel wielding blades and firing tear gas.\nSpokesman Lin Jian did not address those allegations, and instead reasserted Beijing\u2019s claims over the Second Thomas Shoal, known as Ren\u2019ai Jiao in China.\n\u201cThe Philippine operation was not for humanitarian supplies at all. The Philippine vessels carried not only construction materials but also smuggled weapons. They also intentionally rammed into Chinese vessels and splashed water and threw things on Chinese law-enforcement personnel,\u201d Lin said. \u201cThese actions have obviously aggravated tensions at sea and seriously threatened the safety of Chinese personnel and ships.\u201d\nMutual defense treaty\nWhat happens in the South China Sea has profound implications for the US, which has a mutual defense treaty with the Philippines that dates back decades.\nThe latest clash marks the first run-in between the two countries since a new law in China took effect Saturday to authorize its coast guard to seize foreign ships and detain crews suspected of trespassing for up to 60 days without trial.\nIt also comes just weeks after Philippine President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr. warned that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the waterway would be \u201cvery close\u201d to an act of war.\nMarcos has sought closer ties with the US, which has repeatedly stressed Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad commitment\u201d to a 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines that stipulates both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party.\nUS State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Monday the \u201cUnited States stands with its ally the Philippines and condemns the escalatory and irresponsible actions\u201d by China.\nIn a phone call with his Philippine counterpart Enrique A. Manalo on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China\u2019s actions, \u201cundermine regional peace and stability and underscored the United States\u2019 ironclad commitments to the Philippines under our Mutual Defense Treaty.\u201d\nDerek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, a US-based think tank, said the footage released by the Philippines \u201cclearly shows a Chinese attack on Philippine military assets,\u201d which according to Washington and Manila\u2019s defense pact would trigger mutual defense commitments.\n\u201cHowever, in practical terms, the Philippines itself would have to initiate a move to activate (it) before the US would intervene militarily,\u201d he said.\nIn 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines\u2019 claims in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to assert historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea.\nBut Beijing has ignored the ruling. Instead it has increasingly pushed its maritime territorial claims, with China Coast Guard ships \u2013 reinforced by militia boats \u2013 involved in multiple clashes over the past year that have damaged Philippine ships and seen Filipino sailors injured by water cannon.\nPhilippine \u2018restraint\u2019\nThe decision by China\u2019s Coast Guard to use bladed weapons in the latest South China Sea clash has drawn comparisons with clashes between China and India on their disputed Himalayan border, where soldiers on both sides have fought fiercely with sticks, rocks and their hands.\nThe Philippine personnel on the rubber boats are elite forces hailing from the Navy Special Operations Group, Koh said.\n\u201cThey are trained in combat. They did not retaliate against the Chinese because they\u2019re just simply exercising restraint,\u201d he said. \u201cThey probably have received instructions right from the top that under whatever circumstance they are not supposed to fight back against the Chinese and escalate the situation.\u201d\nThe footage released by the Philippine military also showed another striking development \u2013 that the clash took place right next to the BRP Sierra Madre, a rusting US-built Philippine Navy landing craft that was run aground deliberately in 1999, with a national flag hoisted on board, to assert Manila\u2019s territorial claims over Second Thomas Shoal.\nThis is the closest China\u2019s Coast Guard has come to the BRP Sierra Madre, Koh noted.\n\u201cUnder normal rules of engagement, the garrison would have fired warning shots,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that this incident didn\u2019t escalate further is because the Philippines exercised utmost restraint. That\u2019s a simple fact.\u201d\nChina, Koh said, was trying to test both Manila and Washington \u201cto find out exactly where the red line is.\u201d\n\u201cThey wanted to see how far the US is willing to pledge its security commitment to the Filipinos. And of course, I don\u2019t think Beijing is dumb enough not to have considered the possibility of having all these actions escalate the situation, but I believe that was a risk that they, in the end, decided to take.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional developments. CNN\u2019s Manveena Suri contributed reporting."

      "text": "China and the Philippines have each unfurled their national flags on tiny sandbars in the South China Sea, staking competing sovereignty claims in strategic waters seen as a potential flashpoint for global conflict.\nThe rival photo opportunities unfolded on Sandy Cay, a string of three uninhabited sandbars which lie near a Philippine military outpost in the disputed Spratly Islands.\nThe release of the images comes as US and Philippine forces hold their largest-ever annual joint military drills in nearby waters \u2013 and just weeks after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed to enhance America\u2019s military alliance with the Philippines to \u201creestablish deterrence\u201d to counter \u201cChina\u2019s aggression\u201d in the region - during his first trip to Asia.\nBracketed by China and several Southeast Asian nations, parts of the vital South China Sea are claimed by multiple governments, but Beijing has asserted ownership over almost all of the waterway, in defiance of an international court ruling.\nOver the past two decades, China has occupied a number of obscure reefs and atolls far from its shoreline across the South China Sea, building up military installations, including runways and ports.\nThe public relations wrestling match over Sandy Cay risks further stoking long-running tensions between the Philippines and China. It also poses a key test to the Trump administration on how it will respond, especially as key cabinet officials have repeatedly emphasized the need for the US to focus its attention and resources on countering China\u2019s ambitions in the Indo-Pacific region.\nCompeting claims\nThe latest maritime dispute surfaced last week, when China\u2019s state-controlled media claimed that China Coast Guard \u201cimplemented maritime control\u201d and \u201cexercised sovereign jurisdiction\u201d over Tiexian Reef \u2013 the Chinese name for Sandy Cay \u2013 in mid-April.\nA photo aired on China\u2019s state broadcaster Saturday showed four Chinese officers in black uniforms walking along the white sandbar as a fifth officer held an inflatable boat by the water. Another photo showed four officers holding up a Chinese flag in what the broadcaster described as \u201ca show of sovereignty.\u201d\n\u201cChina Coast Guard officers landed on Tiexian Reef to conduct patrols and recorded video evidence of the illegal activities carried out by the Philippine side,\u201d said the state broadcaster CCTV. It added that the officers also cleaned up leftover plastic bottles, wooden sticks and other debris on the reef.\nThe Philippines was quick to unleash its own publicity move in response, sending teams to multiple sandbars.\nOn Sunday, a spokesperson for the Philippines Coast Guard said the country\u2019s navy, coast guard and police deployed four teams in rubber boats to Pag-asa Cay 1, Cay 2 and Cay 3 \u2013 names the Philippines uses to refer to Sandy Cay.\nDuring the inter-agency operation, the officers \u201cobserved the illegal presence\u201d of a nearby China Coast Guard vessel and seven Chinese maritime militia vessels.\nAn image posted by Philippines Coast Guard spokesperson, Jay Tarriela, on X showed five officers holding the national flag on a white sandbar.\nIn a statement late on Sunday night, a spokesperson for the China Coast Guard said six personnel from the Philippines had \u201cillegally landed\u201d on the Tiexian Reef despite \u201cwarnings and dissuasion\u201d from the Chinese side.\n\u201cChina Coast Guard law enforcement officers then boarded the reef to verify and deal with the situation in accordance with the law,\u201d spokesperson Liu Dejun said, urging the Philippines to \u201cimmediately stop its infringement.\u201d\nAt a press conference Monday, Tarriela said each team had brought with them a Philippine flag to pose for photos on the sandbars on early Sunday morning.\n\u201cThe other objective of our operation is to check whether the Chinese government installed different infrastructure or monitoring devices or whatsoever,\u201d Tarriela told reporters.\n\u201c(From) the photos and videos we have already, we can totally debunk the lie and disinformation the People\u2019s Republic of China that they have already occupied the Pag-asa cays.\u201d\nMilitary alliance\nConfrontations between China and the Philippines in the contested waters have become increasingly fraught in recent years, fueling fears of a global conflict that could drag in the US, a mutual defense ally of Manila.\nSandy Cay lie near Thitu Island, known as Pag-asa Island by Manila and the site of a Philippines military facility. In 2023, Manila opened a coast guard monitoring base there to counter what it called Chinese aggression in the vital waterway.\nUnder the Biden administration, US officials repeatedly assured the Philippine that the US would come to its defense if attacked in the South China Sea.\nUS President Donald Trump is a more mercurial figure who has long viewed historical US agreements through a more mercantile lens and has called for allies to pay more for protection.\nBut Trump\u2019s cabinet contains vocal China hawks, notably Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who have both spoken publicly on needing to push back against China\u2019s growing assertiveness in the South China Sea.\nOn April 21, the US and the Philippines kicked off their annual Balikatan \u2013 meaning \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d \u2013 military exercises, which are expected to run for three weeks and have grown in scale each year.\nThis year, the US military has deployed an anti-ship missile launcher for the first time on the northern tip of the Philippine archipelago, just across the strait from Taiwan, a self-governing democracy Beijing has vowed to take by force if necessary.\nThe Philippines also hosted Japanese forces as full-fledged participants for the first time as party of the multinational military drills, a sign of strengthening security cooperation between Manila and Tokyo."
