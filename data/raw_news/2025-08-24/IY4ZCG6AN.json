Fans react as Daniil Medvedev, of Russia, gestures after a photographer ran onto the court during a match against Benjamin Bonzi, of France, in the first-round of the U.S. Open tennis championships, Sunday, Aug. 24, 2025, in New York. Benjamin Bonzi, of France, reacts during a match against Daniil Medvedev, of Russia, in the first-round of the U.S. Open tennis championships, Sunday, Aug. 24, 2025, in New York.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Daniil Medvedev's match was delayed more than six minutes between points Sunday night, after a photographer entered the court on match point and the 2021 U.S. Open champion became enraged by the chair umpire's decision to award his opponent a first serve.\n\nThe latest Medvedev meltdown on Louis Armstrong Stadium led to a wild change in the match. The No. 13 seed was a point away from being eliminated by Benjamin Bonzi for the second straight Grand Slam tournament. Instead, he won the next two sets to force a deciding fifth early Monday.\n\nBonzi had just hit his first serve leading 5-4 in the third set after winning the first two. After he missed it, a photographer left his position before the Frenchman could hit his second.\n\nChair umpire Greg Allensworth told the photographer to get off the court, then announced that Bonzi would get another first serve because of the delay \u2014 which is common in tennis. Medvedev then approached the chair to complain about the decision.\n\n\u201cHe wants to go home, guys. He doesn\u2019t like to be here. He gets paid by the match, not by the hour,\u201d Medvedev shouted into the microphones behind the chair.\n\nMedvedev kept encouraging the loud boos on Armstrong, which eventually lasted so long that he then tried to get fans to quiet down so Bonzi could serve. When Bonzi finally did, he double-faulted, and Medvedev won the game and later the set in a tiebreaker to prolong the match.\n\nIt was reminiscent of Medvedev's 2019 match on the same court, when fans booed him for his antics and he later said in his post-match interview that the crowd gave him energy. Medvedev had snatched the towel from a ballperson during the match and was given a code violation by umpire Damien Dumusois. Medvedev then threw his racket in the direction of Dumusois, barked something at him and later flashed his middle finger next to his forehead as he walked past the umpire\u2019s chair, actions that led to him being fined $9,000 for that match.\n\nMedvedev reached the final that year, then won the title two years later. But he has struggled this year in the majors and was upset by Bonzi in the first round at Wimbledon.\n\nA U.S. Tennis Association spokesman said the photographer was escorted from the court by U.S. Open security and his credential was revoked.",
