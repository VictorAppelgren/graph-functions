  "title": "'How big could this bubble get?': Why a famed strategist says the government bond market could spoil a fragile bull rally",
  "description": "\"Surely we can all agree that rising bond yields will break the equity market at some point? But when?\" writes Albert Edwards.",
  "content": "\u2022 The tech sector is now 37% of the US stock market, surpassing the dot-com era peak.\n\u2022 But rising bond yields will eventually stop the rally, Edwards said.\n\nLike the high market valuation levels he warns about, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale strategist Albert Edwards' bearish missives don't tend to serve well as near-term market timing tools.\n\nHe acknowledges as much.\n\n\"An equity investor who heeded my words of caution on the US Tech 'bubble' will by now have taken to sticking pins in plasticine models of me,\" Edwards wrote in an August 21 note to clients. \"Indeed, my ankle has been hurting for over six months and although the physio says it is tendonitis, I strongly suspect otherwise.\"\n\nBut there's no denying that Edwards, a stark contrarian amid the pervasively bullish attitude on Wall Street these days, has some concerning observations about where the market sits \u2014 particularly with respect to tech stocks, and in the context of government bond yields.\n\nBuilding on his argument that the market is in a bubble, he highlighted in his latest note that the tech sector now makes up 37% of the total US market, which is higher than at the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000. Over the last few years, investors have piled into tech amid the frenzied excitement about AI.\n\nAnother metric showing that the tech sector has historically high valuations is a falling free cash flow yield. This means that current market prices are high relative to cash flow after expenses as tech firms dump money into AI development. The sector has a free cash flow yield of around two. This is also reflected in the S&P 500's low dividend yield of 1.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, long-term government bond yields have surged at the same time as the tech rally, and offer virtually risk-free yields of over 4%.\n\nThe ratio of 10-year Treasury yields to the market's dividend yield has climbed to dot-com era levels.\n\nHistorically, rising bond yields have weighed on stock valuations, but that hasn't seemed to be the case so far in this market. Edwards says it's only a matter of time until that changes.\n\n\"Only the other day, interest rates were rock bottom and equity bulls were telling us that sky high equity valuations were justified by TINA \u2014 There Is No Alternative,\" he wrote. \"But that TINA magic no longer works, now that interest rates are so much higher. So, how come the equity market is able to shrug off the relentless rise in long bond yields by feeding off news of strong profits from a handful of mega-cap tech stocks and the promise of more to come?\"",

      "text": "- Albert Edwards warns of potential further stock declines amid high valuations.\n- He told BI that rising Japanese bond yields could trigger capital outflows from the US market.\n- Edwards' bearish views offer a reality check amid generally bullish Wall Street forecasts, he said.\nEven if the words coming out of Albert Edwards' mouth were gloomy, the famously bearish Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale strategist was in his usual good mood on Tuesday.\nIt's something that tends to catch people off guard when they meet him, he said.\n\"I'm quite a happy, upbeat person,\" Edwards told BI. \"As opposed to the miserable bastard I come across in my written work.\"\nIf you follow the British strategist's research, it's not hard to see why he comes across as a grouch. He is known as a perennial bear on Wall Street (he refuses the moniker of \"perma-bear\" and prefers \"uber-bear\").\nHis weekly client notes regularly question the prevailing market narrative and warn of downside scenarios. His latest report warned that rising Japanese bond yields could lead to a \"global financial market Armageddon.\"\nHis tune during a May 27 interview was no different. Edwards, who shot to fame for correctly calling the eventual dot-com bust in the late 1990s, said that stocks are still vulnerable to a pullback after their 18% rally from April lows. Despite investors starting to discount recession and inflation risks on the heels of President Donald Trump's tariff reductions, valuations remain high and risks abound, he said.\nOne of those risks is the possibility that investors start to question hefty AI spending from the mega-cap tech firms. Another is a potential recession.\nBut, in his opinion, the top risk the market should be aware of is rising Japanese interest rates, which could cause an exodus of capital from the US as investors unwind the yen carry trade and chase more attractive yields.\nThe Bank of Japan, having kept interest rates low for years, pushed flows of money into US stocks and bonds. Now that the trend is reversing, those flows could grind to a halt, he said.\nUltimately, however, it's not easy to know what will spark a stock-market decline. What's easier to know is simply that the market is in a precarious spot thanks to \"steamy\" valuations. One popular measure, the Shiller CAPE ratio, shows stock valuations at some of their highest levels in history.\n\"These are really super high valuations,\" he said. \"And you look at things like the relationship between bonds and equities, with bond yields where they are now and the equity risk premium being so low.\"\n\"You just think, 'You're a bit vulnerable here to bad news, aren't you?'\" he added. \"Something comes along, you really are not in a great situation.\"\nThe resident bear\nEdwards is something of an anomaly on Wall Street. Most of the time, top strategists issue fairly bullish forecasts.\nFor example, in January this year, the average 2025 S&P 500 price target saw 11.5% upside. Just two strategists \u2014 Stifel's Barry Bannister and BCA Research's Peter Berezin \u2014 predicted negative returns this year. It remains to be seen whether that will be the case, but suffice to say, investors were caught off guard by the S&P 500's 20% decline from February to April.\nIt's these rapid declines, though few and far between, that Edwards wants investors to keep in mind as possible outcomes in frothy environments. As a result of pessimistic tendencies, Edwards isn't correct all too often, but that's not necessarily the point \u2014 and his readers know that.\n\"A lot of clients who totally disagree with me like to read my stuff. It's a reality check,\" he said.\nEarlier this year, financial professionals detailed to BI the pressure that strategists face from both their bosses and clients if they're wrongly bearish for too long. David Rosenberg, who called the housing bubble and recession in the mid-to-late 2000s while working as the chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said the firm asked him not to use the word \"bubble\" to describe housing market dynamics at the time because it was scaring clients.\nEdwards said he doesn't feel that pressure. He writes his notes as Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's \"alternative view,\" separate from their house view.\n\"You have to have good employers,\" he said. \"People have said to me, 'If you worked at an American bank, you'd be fired immediately because of your views.'\""

He argues that rising U.S. and Japanese bond yields will eventually erode the rally, while the current low equity risk premium and high CAPE ratio leave the market vulnerable to a pullback.
