      "summary": "Global negotiations on plastic pollution in Geneva have stalled, with countries unable to agree on production caps or waste management strategies. The OECD warns that without stronger policies, plastic use and waste could triple by 2060, exacerbating health and environmental issues. ProSocial AI is proposed as a solution, offering innovative approaches to reduce plastic waste and enhance sustainability through strategic design and verification processes. Malaysia's dual identity as a fossil fuel producer and an aspiring AI leader presents an opportunity to leverage AI for environmental challenges, potentially positioning the country as a leader in sustainable practices.",
