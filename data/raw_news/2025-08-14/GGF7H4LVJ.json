  "description": "Former Texas wide receiver Isaiah Bond has been cleared from sexual assault charges.",
  "content": "Former Texas wide receiver Isaiah Bond was cleared of sexual assault charges and is quickly getting started on his NFL career.\n\nIn April, just weeks before the 2025 draft, Bond turned himself in to police in Frisco, Texas, over an outstanding warrant involving the sexual assault allegations. He went undrafted despite being projected to be an early-to-mid-round draft pick before the allegations surfaced.\n\nOn Thursday, a grand jury returned a \u201cno bill\u201d account, and Bond then announced he was signing with the Browns, though the team has not made anything official.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, I want to express my deepest gratitude to the Cleveland Browns for believing in me and allowing me the opportunity to continue my career in the NFL,\u201d Bond wrote in a statement on X.\n\nBond addressed the charges in his statement, writing, \u201cI know there have been questions and reports about the recent allegations. I am grateful for the decision of the prosecutor and the courts not to pursue charges. I will learn from this experience as I grow in wisdom, character and faith.\n\n\u201cOn the advice of my attorney, I will not discuss the details of this case, but I want to be clear: From the very beginning, I have refuted these allegations and maintained my innocence. I stand firm by that today.\u201d\n\nBond released a statement on Instagram shortly after the news broke, denying the charges.\n\n\u201cRegarding the accusation made against me, I would appreciate the time and opportunity to defend myself and prove the claims made, patently false,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am in full cooperation with the authorities and will remain a willing and active participant in the investigation. Unfortunately, claims like these prove to be harmful to all involved, absent full review.\n\n\u201cI kindly request that all reserve judgement until the authorities provide a complete report based on truth and evidence.\u201d\n\nBond starred for the Longhorns last season with 34 catches for 540 yards and five touchdowns in 14 games.",

She had boundless energy and was very determined to achieve whatever she set out to do,\u201d Hayley\u2019s dad, Dave, told People in a statement. \u201cShe set her sights on bodybuilding and fitness and achieved the highest success that sector offered. She loved us and we love Hayley very much, we miss her madly.\u201d\nMcNeff\u2019s family is set to hold a service on Saturday and has asked for attendees to make a donation to the National Alliance on Mental Illness in McNeff\u2019s honor.\nPer the obituary, McNeff graduated from Concord-Carlisle High School and University of Massachusetts Amherst, and was an accomplished bodybuilder in the 2000s with state titles in Maryland and Delaware. She was also part of the 2005 documentary \u201cRaising the Bar,\u201d which highlights the world of the sport.\n\u201cThe quest for getting huge will never end,\u201d McNeff said about her career in the documentary. \u201cThere\u2019s no limit. I hope there\u2019s a day that I\u2019ll be able to look in the mirror 100% of the time and be like, \u2018Yeah man, I\u2019m huge.'\u201d\nAfter retirement from the sport, McNeff decided to pursue a graduate degree in psychology.\n\u201cShe had a gift for making those around her laugh and feel welcomed,\u201d the obituary reads. \u201cHer energy and determination was a constant in her life and she always accomplished what she set out to achieve. She treasured her friendships and nurtured strong, lasting relationships with those who knew her best. Hayley will be deeply missed by her parents, siblings, extended family, and friends.\u201d\nUpon hearing the news of McNeff\u2019s death, bodybuilding coach Dave Palumbo posted a tribute message on Instagram.\n\u201cI\u2019m sad to hear of the passing of former woman bodybuilder @hayleysmash (HAYLEY MCNEFF) \u2026 she left us way too soon,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShe was a good soul, super intelligent and had tremendous potential as a bodybuilder. She appeared in @dave_pulcinella RAISING THE BAR videos back in the day and I was proud to be able to call her a friend. Prayers to her family and friends. R.I.P. @official_rxmuscle.\u201d\nMcNeff is one of many bodybuilders who have recently passed away.\nZunila Hoyos Mendez died at 43 in June after she was killed in a hammer attack.

      "text": "A five-time Pro Bowl guard quietly retired earlier this year and it only came out after it was reported on in a spotlight feature done by his alma mater.\nBrandon Scherff retired from the NFL this summer after 10 years in the NFL, a 2025 Iowa Athletics Hall of Fame spotlight feature reported.\nScherff had played seven seasons with the Washington Commanders organization, earning Pro Bowl nods in 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\nThe NFL All-Pro \u2014 who earned the nod in 2020 \u2014 spent his last three seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nAll told, he made over $111 million over the life of four contract per Spotrac, three with Washington and his final deal with Jacksonville, a three-year, $49.5 million pact in 2022.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been something I could never dream of,\u201d he said in the feature. \u201cSometimes I would tell my wife that she has to pinch me, because I\u2019m playing a kid\u2019s game, and being able to do it as a job is pretty amazing. Now, having kids and being able to see them after games is absolutely wonderful. So I would say it\u2019s a dream come true. And I will be forever grateful to have had that chance.\u201d\nIn a post on X, NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport reported that teams had been told in the spring that he was retiring.\nScherff was the No. 5 overall pick in 2015 by Washington and during the course of his decade in the league, he played in \u2014 and started \u2014 140 games.\nScherff, a native of Iowa, was essential to Jacksonville\u2019s surprising run to the AFC Divisional Round in the 2022 playoffs.\nHe will turn 34 years old this coming December."
