  "description": "The thinner handset could feature a 5.5mm profile and replace the iPhone Plus model.",
  "content": "As September approaches, we're getting closer to learning whether Apple will unveil a super-thin iPhone with the rest of its upcoming lineup.\n\nApple hasn't confirmed any details about the iPhone 17, but that hasn't stopped the rumor mill from churning -- especially as it relates to this supposedly thin new model, which has been dubbed the \"iPhone 17 Air\" in the meantime. It could serve as a successor to the iPhone 16 Plus, with a 6.6-inch display, making it smaller than the iPhone 16 Pro Max but bigger than the baseline and Pro models. It could also include higher RAM, new colors and a battery boost -- thanks in part to iOS 26's Adaptive Power feature.\n\nApple's ultra-thin phone could be the latest to join a slew of skinny phones, including the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. But in its effort to slim down the device, Apple would likely need to make hardware trade-offs, which might include a single rear camera. Plus, there's the possibility of a high price tag, which could also be impacted by tariffs.\n\nThe wait is almost over, but for now, we're rounding up all the latest rumors, leaks and speculation about the new iPhone. Let's dig in.\n\nRead more: Should You Buy an iPhone 16 or Wait for the iPhone 17?\n\niPhone 17 Air size: How thin will it be?\n\nIf the rumored iPhone 17 Air lives up to its name, then the biggest potential advantage it could offer over the rest of the lineup is its size and weight. A Bloomberg report from March notes that the iPhone Air could measure 5.5mm thick, compared to the iPhone 16 Pro at 8.25mm. The iPhone 17 Pro Max could get as thick as 8.725mm to make room for a bigger battery, according to a report by 9to5Mac.\n\nMatt Talks Tech posted a YouTube video on July 19 comparing the thickness of an iPhone 17 Air model with an iPhone 6, the last thinnest iPhone:\n\nMac Rumors reported in May that a leaker on the Korean-language Naver blog, going by yeux1122, said that the rumored iPhone 17 Air weighs approximately 145 grams (5.11 ounces). Compare that with the iPhone 16 Pro, which weighs 199 grams (7.03 ounces). If this rumor proves true, the Air would be just slightly heavier than the iPhone 13 mini, which weighs 141 grams (4.97 ounces).\n\nTo slim down the iPhone, Apple may have to make some camera compromises.\n\nIn July, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reiterated the long-standing rumor that the iPhone 17 Air will only feature one rear camera for wide-angle shots. That would place it in the same camp as the $599 iPhone 16E, which has a single rear camera with a 48-megapixel sensor -- though it's not clear if the iPhone 17 Air will have the same sensor. Bloomberg also noted earlier this year that the rumored Air may not have the ultrawide and 5x telephoto lenses that have become staples of Apple's premium iPhones.\n\nIn a bit of good news, it's also rumored that the front-facing \"selfie\" camera on all iPhone 17 models, including the Air, will be upgraded to 24 megapixels, according to analyst Jeff Pu.\n\nIn February, Front Page Tech shared a re-created render of the iPhone 17 Air, which supposedly includes a glimpse of the camera, in this video on YouTube:\n\nDisplay: Smaller than a Plus, bigger than a Pro?\n\nRumor has it that the Air will have a 6.6-inch display, according to analysts Pu and Kuo, who also said the display resolution would be around 1260x2740 pixels. That aligns with the wallpaper resolution Macworld found in the second iOS 26 developer beta -- a resolution that no existing iPhone currently has.\n\nIf rumors are accurate, the iPhone 17 Air's display will be slightly smaller than the iPhone 16 Plus, which has a 6.7-inch display, but larger than the iPhone 16 Pro, which features a 6.3-inch display. The iPhone 16 Pro Max leads with a 6.9-inch display. It's unclear if the iPhone 17 Air's screen would be a Pro Motion display like the one found on iPhone Pro models.\n\nPerformance: Could an Air get the A19 Pro chip?\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air could benefit from some performance boosts.\n\nBloomberg reported back in March that the rumored phone will have a standard A19 chip, instead of the A19 Pro landing on the Pro versions. Kuo shared the same prediction as recently as July 24.\n\nBut a Weibo account known as Fixed Focus Digital said the iPhone 17 Air will come with an A19 Pro chip, MacRumors reported on July 9. But the Air would have a 5-core GPU, according to the rumor, whereas the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max would get a 6-core GPU.\n\nApple is also reportedly bringing more design in-house to improve connectivity across all devices. In February, Kuo said Apple will swap out Broadcom's Wi-Fi chips for in-house chips across the iPhone 17 lineup.\n\nOne of the key challenges of slimming down a phone is figuring out how to not compromise battery life.\n\nInitially, it was assumed that a skinnier iPhone would simply have reduced battery life, since there would be less space to house a battery. But more recently, AppleInsider reported that a skinnier iPhone might use a silicon-anode battery to help extend battery life.\n\nLeaker Yeux1122 said the iPhone 17 Air's battery capacity is 2,800mAh, based on details from a \"mass production confirmed sample,\" according to MacRumors. The leaker adds that a high-density battery in the Air could increase its \"actual capacity\" by 15% to 20%. Kuo also noted back in March that the phone could have that \"high-density\" battery.\n\nIf the rumored iPhone 17 Air does use the silicon battery technology, it would be the first iPhone to do so.\n\nOne feature that could help avoid battery drain is Adaptive Power in iOS 26. This can help conserve battery by automatically adjusting your iPhone's performance based on how you're using the it at that moment, according to Apple.\n\nAnd while the appeal of a skinnier iPhone may be its sleekness, Apple could still release a battery case as an iPhone 17 Air accessory, according to a May report from Wayne Ma with The Information.\n\nIn April, Kuo noted the iPhone 17 Air will sport 12GB of RAM, just like the upcoming Pro models. (The baseline iPhone 17 is expected to stay at 8GB, according to both Kuo and Pu.) Tipster Digital Chat Station noted that the boost is largely thanks to the \"large scale\" use of Apple Intelligence and AI on the devices.\n\nCurrent rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air come come in these shades:\n\nOn Aug. 3, Majin Bu posted photos on X of the predicted color lineup across the iPhone 17 series:\n\nBloomberg's report also notes that the iPhone 17 Air is expected to have superslim bezels compared to the rest of the line, along with a Camera Control button and a Dynamic Island cutout in the display.\n\nPu predicted in May that all the iPhone 17 models will use a new metalens technology for the proximity sensor, according to 9to5Mac. That technology could allow Apple to reduce the size of the Face ID sensor and its Dynamic Island. However, Pu's report contradicts Kuo, who previously said that the Dynamic Island would remain \"largely unchanged\" in the iPhone 17 lineup compared to the iPhone 16.\n\nIn a post to X on June 26, Bu said the front camera might be placed on the left of the Dynamic Island, based on leaked screen protector designs. Other iPhone 17 models appear to retain the camera on the right side:\n\nAir or Slim? What we know about the name\n\nThe title for the rumored skinny iPhone is still unclear -- in fact, we still don't know if Apple's new lineup will even be called the iPhone 17, as it's been known to switch up its naming conventions. (Take, for example, its decision to follow iOS 18 with iOS 26, instead of the expected moniker iOS 19, to coincide with the upcoming year.)\n\nWe likely won't find out the phone's official name until Apple announces its new iPhone lineup. But most rumors and leaks -- including this video Bu shared of a dummy model on X on July 9 -- refer to the skinnier iPhone as \"Air\":\n\niPhone 17 Air release date: Is the slimmer iPhone coming this year?\n\nFor nearly a decade, Apple has held an event on the first Tuesday of September after Labor Day to announce its new phones. We expect Apple to follow a similar schedule this year for the release of its iPhone 17 line, including the rumored iPhone 17 Air.\n\nHowever, the first Tuesday is the day after Labor Day in 2025, so Apple may push the dates for its iPhone event to Wednesday, Sept. 3, or Tuesday, Sept. 9. That would mean a release date of Sept. 12 or 19. Most rumors point to Sept. 9 as the expected date for Apple's iPhone reveal event.\n\nThe iPhone 17 lineup may be the last to follow this fall-release model, according to Kuo and a report from The Information. Starting with the iPhone 18, Apple will reportedly split its phone releases so that lower-cost iPhones launch in the first half of the year (previously reserved for iPhone SE models) and higher-end Pro models are announced in the latter half. That would likely mean a rumored iPhone 18 Pro, Pro Max, Air and new foldable iPhone model could debut in fall 2026. Keep in mind that an iPhone Flip or Fold has been rumored for years.\n\nYou'll likely be able to preorder a new iPhone the Friday after the announcement, with the phone shipping a week later. Based on the expected announcement on Sept. 3 or 9, the preorder date could be either Sept. 5 or 12, respectively.\n\nSee also: The iPhone 17 Air Could Hint at Apple's Foldable Future\n\nWhat will the iPhone 17 Air cost?\n\nEarly rumors about the iPhone 17 Air's price tag hinted it could cost even more than the iPhone 17 Pro. But a Bloomberg report from March suggested the phone could cost about $900. That price tag would align with the rumor that the Air could replace the Plus, which currently costs $929. For comparison, Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge starts at $1,100.\n\nHowever, there's also the question of how tariffs could affect the price of an iPhone. Amid President Donald Trump's ongoing tariff drama, he's threatened Apple with a 25% tariff if the company doesn't move iPhone manufacturing to the US.\n\nHow much all of this could affect iPhone prices is yet to be determined, but an extra 25% could push an iPhone 17 Air to more than $1,100. That's based on the price of an iPhone 16 Plus, which the iPhone 17 Air is rumored to be replacing. None of the pricing rumors has been confirmed by Apple.\n\nRegardless of how tariffs play out, Apple is expected to raise the price of the iPhone. These price hikes are rumored to start with the iPhone 17 line, so prepare now to pay more for Air.\n\nAre iPhone Air rumors and leaks to be trusted?\n\nRumors are just that. The speculation leading up to the iPhone's release is often based on insider knowledge or leaked information from the teams working on the iPhone's design, but those plans can evolve and are not necessarily reflected in the final product. We'll only be able to confirm these rumors with certainty when Apple officially releases the next iPhone.",

  "summary": "Apple is expected to unveil a thin new model of the iPhone 17, codenamed the \"iPhone 17 Air\" in September. The phone could be a successor to the iPhone 16 Plus with a 6.6-inch display, smaller than the iPhone 6 Plus but larger than the baseline and Pro models. It could also include higher RAM, new colors, and a battery boost thanks to iOS 26's Adaptive Power feature. However, Apple may need to make hardware trade-offs, including a single rear camera, and potentially a high price tag. The front-facing \"selfie\" camera on all iPhone 17 models will reportedly be upgraded to 24 megapixels, according to analyst Jeff Pu. The iPhone 17 Air could also benefit from some performance boosts from a standard A19 chip instead of the A19 Pro.",

      "text": "The question of how new tariffs will affect prices is more relevant than ever, with President Donald Trump's new reciprocal tariff deadline only days away and a new Consumer Price Index summary showing that the inflation rate was 2.7% in June, the biggest jump since February. It's enough to get anyone concerned about affordability in the US -- as if we all weren't worrying about it already -- and the worst of it still might not have arrived yet.\nAmid those worries, I've been tracking prices every day for 11 key products likely to be hit by price increases from tariffs and the picture I've painted so far is this: Not much has changed, at least not yet. The winding road of tariff inflation still stretches before us into an uncertain future and the threat of price hikes continues to cloud the horizon. As some economists recently told Vox, the upward trend in inflation is almost certain to continue if Trump's tariffs remain at the levels being discussed.\nTo date, I've seen two noteworthy price increases, one for the Xbox Series X and the other for a popular budget-friendly 4K TV. Some other products have gone on sale for brief periods. Notably, other outlets have caught a number of major retailers hiking prices across the board, with CNBC finding some substantial inflation at Walmart specifically.\nCNET Tariff Tracker Index\nAbove, you can check out a chart with the average price of the 11 products included in this piece over the course of 2025. This will help give you a sense of the overall price changes and fluctuations going on. Further down, you'll be able to check out charts for each individual product being tracked. Based on the numbers so far, the average has gone up noticeably since the start of the year but this has been driven mostly by big shifts for a few products, as most price are still stable.\nWe'll be updating this article regularly as prices change. It's all in the name of helping you make sense of things so be sure to check back every so often. For more, check out CNET's guide to whether you should wait to make big purchases or buy them now and get expert tips about how to prepare for a recession.\nMethodology\nWe're checking prices daily and will update the article and the relevant charts right away to reflect any changes. The following charts show a single bullet point for each month, with the most recent one labeled \"Now\" and showing the current price. For the past months, we've gone with what was the most common price for each item in the given month.\nIn most cases, the price stats used in these graphs were pulled from Amazon using the historical price-tracker tool Keepa. For the iPhones, the prices come from Apple's official materials and are based on the 128-gigabyte base model of the latest offering of the iPhone 16. For the Xbox Series X, the prices were sourced from Best Buy using the tool PriceTracker. If any of these products happen to be on sale at a given time, we'll be sure to let you know and explain how those price drops differ from longer-term pricing trends that tariffs can cause.\nThe 11 products we're tracking\nMostly what we're tracking in this article are electronic devices and digital items that CNET covers in depth, like iPhones and affordable 4K TVs -- along with a typical bag of coffee, a more humble product that isn't produced in the US to any significant degree.\nThe products featured were chosen for a few reasons: Some of them are popular and/or affordable representatives for major consumer tech categories, like smartphones, TVs and game consoles. Others are meant to represent things that consumers might buy more frequently, like printer ink or coffee beans. Some products were chosen over others because they are likely more susceptible to tariffs. Some of these products have been reviewed by CNET or have been featured in some of our best lists.\n- iPhone 16, 128GB\n- Duracell AA batteries, 24-pack\n- Samsung DU7200 65-inch TV\n- Xbox Series X\n- Apple AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C case\n- HP 962 CMY Printer Ink\n- Anker 10,000-mAh, 30-watt power bank\n- Bose TV speaker\n- Oral-B Pro 1000 electric toothbrush\n- Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i Chromebook, 256GB\n- Starbucks 28-ounce ground dark roast coffee\nBelow, we'll get into more about each individual product, and stick around till the end for a rundown of some other products worth noting.\niPhone 16\nThe iPhone is the most popular smartphone brand in the US, so this was a clear priority for price tracking. The iPhone has also emerged as a major focal point for conversations about tariffs, given its popularity and its susceptibility to import taxes because of its overseas production, largely in China. Trump has reportedly been fixated on the idea that the iPhone can and should be manufactured in the US, an idea that experts have dismissed as a fantasy. Estimates have also suggested that a US-made iPhone would cost as much as $3,500.\nSomething to note about this graph: The price listed is the one you'll see if you buy your phone through a major carrier. If you, say, buy direct from Apple or Best Buy without a carrier involved, you'll be charged an extra $30, so in some places, you might see the list price of the standard iPhone 16 listed as $830.\nApple's been taking a few steps to protect its prices in the face of these tariffs, flying in bulk shipments of product before they took effect and planning to move production for the US market from China to India. A new Reuters report found that a staggering 97% of iPhones imported from the latter country, March through May, were bound for the US. This latter move drew the anger of Trump again, threatening the company with a 25% tariff if they didn't move production to the US, an idea CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly shot down in the past. This came after Trump gave a tariff exemption to electronic devices including smartphones, so the future of that move seems in doubt now.\nDuracell AA batteries\nA lot of the tech products in your home might boast a rechargeable energy source but individual batteries are still an everyday essential and I can tell you from experience that as soon as you forget about them, you'll be needing to restock. The Duracell AAs we're tracking are some of the bestselling batteries on Amazon.\nSamsung DU7200 TV\nAlongside smartphones, televisions are some of the most popular tech products out there, even if they're an infrequent purchase. This particular product is a popular entry-level 4K TV and was CNET's pick for best overall budget TV for 2025. Unlike a lot of tech products that have key supply lines in China, Samsung is a South Korean company, so it might have some measure of tariff resistance.\nAfter spending most of 2025 hovering around $400, this item has now seen some notable upticks on Amazon, most recently sitting around $450, a change that has stuck around long enough to seem permanent. This could potentially be in reaction to Trump's announcement of 25% tariffs against South Korea.\nXbox Series X\nVideo game software and hardware are a market segment expected to be hit hard by the Trump tariffs. Microsoft's Xbox is the first console brand to see price hikes -- the company cited \"market conditions\" along with the rising cost of development. Most notably, this included an increase in the price of the flagship Xbox Series X, up from $500 to $600. Numerous Xbox accessories also were affected and the company also said that \"certain\" games will eventually see a price hike from $70 to $80.\nInitially, we were tracking the price of the much more popular Nintendo Switch as a representative of the gaming market. Nintendo has not yet hiked the price of its handheld-console hybrid and stressed that the $450 price tag of the upcoming Switch 2 has not yet been inflated because of tariffs. Sony, meanwhile, has so far only increased prices on its PlayStation hardware in markets outside the US.\nAirPods Pro 2\nThe latest iteration of Apple's wildly popular true-wireless earbuds are here to represent the headphone market. Much to the chagrin of the audiophiles out there, a quick look at sales charts on Amazon shows you just how much the brand dominates all headphone sales.\nHP 962 CMY printer ink\nThis HP printer ink includes cyan, magenta and yellow all in one product and recently saw its price jump from around $72 -- where it stayed for most of 2025 -- to $80, which is around its highest price over the last five years. We will be keeping tabs to see if this is a long-term change or a brief uptick.\nThis product replaced Overture PLA Filament for 3D printers in this piece, but we're still tracking that item.\nAnker 10,000-mAh, 30-watt power bank\nAnker's accessories are perennially popular in the tech space and the company has already announced that some of its products will get more expensive as a direct result of tariffs. This specific product has also been featured in some of CNET's lists of the best portable chargers.\nBose TV speaker\nSoundbars have become important purchases, given the often iffy quality of the speakers built into TVs. While not the biggest or the best offering in the space, the Bose TV Speaker is one of the more affordable soundbar options out there, especially hailing from a brand as popular as Bose.\nOral-B Pro 1000 electric toothbrush\nThey might be a lot more expensive than their traditional counterparts but electric toothbrushes remain a popular choice for consumers because of how well they get the job done. I know my dentist won't let up on how much I need one. This particular Oral-B offering was CNET's overall choice for the best electric toothbrush for 2025.\nLenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i Chromebook\nLenovo is notable among the big laptop manufacturers for being a Chinese company making its products especially susceptible to Trump's tariffs. For now, its price on Amazon has remained pretty much static, aside from some brief dips down to $480.\nStarbucks Ground Coffee (28-ounce bag)\nCoffee is included in this tracker because of its ubiquity -- I'm certainly drinking too much of it these days -- and because it's uniquely susceptible to Trump's tariff agenda. Famously, coffee beans can only be grown within a certain distance from Earth's equator, a tropical span largely outside the US and known as the \"Coffee Belt.\"\nHawaii is the only part of the US that can produce coffee beans, with data from USAFacts showing that 11.5 million pounds were harvested there in the 2022-23 season -- little more than a drop in the mug, as the US consumed 282 times that amount of coffee during that period. Making matters worse, Hawaiian coffee production has declined in the past few years.\nAll that to say: Americans get almost all of their coffee from overseas, making it one of the most likely products to see price hikes from tariffs. While this particular bag of beans from Starbucks hasn't seen its price budge for most of the year, in recent days it ticked up by less than a dollar on Amazon, which could be a sign of further increases to come.\nOther products\nAs mentioned, we occasionally swap out products with different ones that undergo notable price shifts. Here are some things no longer featured above, but that we're still keeping an eye on:\n- Nintendo Switch: The baseline handheld-console hybrid has held steady around $299 most places -- including Amazon -- since it released in 2017. Whether that price will be affected by tariffs or the release of the Switch 2 remains to be seen. This product was replaced above with the Xbox Series X.\n- Overture PLA 3D printer filament: This is a popular choice on Amazon for the material needed to run 3D printers. It has held steady around $15 on Amazon all year. This product was replaced above by the HP 962 printer ink.\nHere are some products we also wanted to single out that haven't been featured with a graph yet:\n- Razer Blade 18 (2025), 5070 Ti edition: The latest revision of Razer's largest gaming laptop saw a $300 price bump recently, with the base model featured an RTX 5070 Ti graphics card now priced at $3,500 ahead of launch, compared to the $3,200 price announced in February. While Razer has stayed mum about the reasoning, it did previously suspend direct sales to the US as Trump's tariff plans were ramping up in April.\n- Asus ROG Ally X: The premium version of Asus's Steam Deck competitor handheld gaming PC recently saw a price hike from $799 to $899, coinciding with the announcement of the company's upcoming Xbox-branded Ally handhelds."

      "text": "We tested dozens and dozens of smartphones over the past year and this list has the best camera phones that you can buy in 2025. Nearly all phones can take a decent photo. But for consistently great images, even in low-light settings, you need a phone with a top camera setup. For example, the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the Pixel 9 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro all have amazing cameras with features that even professional photographers can appreciate. Even the new Galaxy Z Fold 7 made the list thanks to its S25 Ultra-like camera. Every phone on this list includes pro-level tools for shooting RAW images, recording log video and manually controlling camera settings.\nOur Picks\nMOBILE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $449 (save $50)\n- $550 (save $50)\n- $300 (save $100)\nWhat is the best camera phone?\nIt's important to keep in mind that there isn't a best camera phone for everyone. Even among CNET's phone reviewers, there isn't a \"perfect\" phone that suits all our needs. We look at how these cameras perform in real-life situations: How they balance exposures, how they handle colors and how easy they are to use. Read our guide to help find the best phone camera for your needs.\nWe thoroughly tested and compared dozens of phones and found that one with more lenses or megapixels isn't necessarily any better at taking great shots. Top phones, like the iPhone 16 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro, tend to have a variety of lenses, including an ultrawide and a telephoto with 5x optical zoom, and use larger image sensors and camera features for AI-powered computational photography. Then there's the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's camera, which has 3x and 5x optical zoom lenses and can take some of the best zoom photos that you can possibly get from a phone.\nThe $999 iPhone 16 Pro and $1,199 iPhone 16 Pro Max have the same trio of lenses: wide, ultrawide and 5x telephoto. The new 48-megapixel ultrawide camera is a big step up from previous iPhone models. It not only takes outstanding photos but doubles as a high-res macro lens to get the perfect focus on your food snaps. Both phones also support 4K 120fps slow-motion video that looks outstanding. A new Camera Control button doubles as a shortcut key to open the camera but also as a shutter button. It can also be used as a zoom rocker or to swipe through Apple's revamped Photographic Styles -- letting you preview each one in the viewfinder before you take a single pic. Both phones pack advanced features such as ProRaw images, ProRes video capture and recording in Log color space, which makes them powerful tools for professional filmmakers.\nIs the iPhone 16 Pro leaps and bounds ahead of what Google and Samsung are doing? No. In terms of consistency, reliability and approachability, the iPhone 16 Pro is our pick for people who want a top-notch camera system that's easy to use. For the latest news about the iPhone, check out everything Apple announced at WWDC 2025.\nBest camera phones of 2025\nPros\n- Larger screens/thinner bezels\n- 4K slo-mo OMG\n- Audio Mix is brilliant\n- iOS 18\nCons\n- No Apple Intelligence out of the box\n- Camera Control placement not optimal for one-handed shooting\n- Elegant finishes aren't very colorful\n- Only 128GB of storage for $1,000\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have everything I've come to expect in a year-over-year upgrade. The 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max have a slew of upgrades including one of the best batteries on any phone I've tested as well as. In our testing it will easily last a day on a single charge.\nThe phones also have larger displays, outstanding photo and video chops, high-resolution slo-mo, a new Camera Control button, iOS 18 goodies and a handful of Apple Intelligence tools. The negatives are as thin as the borders around the new screens: You only get 128GB of storage for $1,000; there are only drab color options, and a the new camera button is easy to tap accidentally. Read our full iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max review.\nWhy we like it\nThis year the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have the exact same cameras -- unlike the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, which had different telephoto options. Screen size, battery life and price should be the deciding factors when you're choosing between the two. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are excellent phones worthy of a spot in your pocket (and mine) if you can afford them.\nWho it's best for\nIf you have an iPhone 12 Pro or older, upgrading to the 16 Pro makes a lot of sense. If you're on a 13 Pro and still have a decent battery capacity, I'd say save your money. And if you're on a 14 Pro or 15 Pro, there's no need to upgrade. Also, I should note that the entry-level $999 iPhone 16 Pro only has 128GB of storage.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you are looking for a budget phone or don't need a phone with the latest features or tech.\nPros\n- Camera Control is useful for switching camera settings\n- Photographic Styles makes photos pop\n- Ultrawide camera is better in low light\nCons\n- Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t out yet\n- No always on display\n- No changes to wired charging speeds\n- No upgrades to the Action button\nWhen I tested the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus I was definitely impressed by the new photography features, the convenient Action button and the elegant build. I consider these phones to be top-notch choices for Apple fans. Parts of the iPhone 16\u2019s key feature, Apple Intelligence, are now out, and the fact that these phones will support it means they\u2019ll likely feel future-proofed for years to come. Aside from screen size (6.1 inches on the regular, 6.7 inches on the Plus), battery size and price, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are identical in every way.\nThe iPhone 16 isn\u2019t perfect -- it\u2019s missing an always-on display, and it feels like it\u2019s been ages since Apple improved its wired charging speeds. But it checks all the important boxes and then some.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus rank so high in our testing because the phones appeal to both novice users and power players a like. They offer about 90% of the experience of Apple's Pro models but cost hundreds of dollars less. Not only is the iPhone 16 a wonderful phone out of the box, Apple has a long track record of updating its software and security patches for years.\nWho it's best for\nWhen you think about how the Camera Control key, the Action button and the Dynamic Island come together, along with the camera and battery improvements Apple has made over the last several years, the iPhone 16 is a compelling upgrade for someone coming from an older iPhone, especially if that person is on an iPhone 13 or older. For those who don\u2019t need the Pro\u2019s extra photography prowess and battery life, the iPhone 16 won\u2019t disappoint.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nI wouldn't recommend buying the iPhone 16 just for the Camera Control button or the better ultrawide camera.\nPros\n- Genuinely fun new AI skills\n- Sleek new design\n- Seven years of software updates\n- Cameras can take great daytime shots\nCons\n- Camera hardware hasn't improved much over Pixel 8 Pro\n- Gemini AI will eventually require a paid subscription\nThe Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL have a lot going for them, from their shiny new designs and long software support period. But it's the AI skills that really stand out, from the deep integration of the conversational Gemini Live, to the new Pixel Studio that creates weird and wonderful images from your text prompts.\nThe phones aren't perfect. While the cameras are good and can take excellent photos in bright light, they're just okay in low-light and in night mode. The best AI features will require a monthly subscription (though you get the first year for free) But if you're keen to experiment with AI on your phone then the new Pixel 9 Pro range is a superb way to experience it. Read our Google Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL review.\nWhy we like it\nGoogle's Pixel line of phones has gone from strength to strength and its latest model is unquestionably the best phone the company has ever made. It's not just the slick-looking design; the Pixel 9 Pro offers a superb camera system, a generous support period and a host of new AI skills making it one of the most accomplished Android phones around. The 9 Pro XL takes that further by accommodating a bright and vibrant 6.8-inch display.\nWho it's best for\nIt's a great phone for those of you looking for an elegant everyday Android phone. The interface is easy to navigate and the camera takes great photos with almost no effort on your part. If you feel overwhelmed by the plethora of settings and menus on other Android flagships, Google's Pixel 9 Pro is the way to go. If playing mobile games or watching videos on the go is a priority, opt for the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you don't need the best cameras Google makes, consider the regular Pixel 9. I do like the fit and finish better on the 9 Pro, but it starts at $999.\nPros\n- Best screen on any phone\n- Versatile cameras\n- Most powerful phone I've tested\n- Good battery life\nCons\n- $1,300 price\n- Design is almost too minimal\n- AI features are hit-or-miss\n- S25/S25 Plus have similar features and cost less\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra which has a lot of AI features, the best of which are interesting and the worst of which unreliable. Luckily, Samsung gets a lot of other things right on the S25 Ultra, which has a new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, high-resolution ultrawide camera, and some sweet pro video tools that rival the iPhone 16 Pro. Samsung wisely kept all the best parts of last year's Galaxy S24 Ultra (basically the entire phone including that antireflective display) but some of its worst parts, too, like the $1,300 price tag.\nIf you want the best screen you can find on any phone, get the S25 Ultra. If you want the most versatile phone cameras, get the S25 Ultra. If you want a stylus, get the S25 Ultra. But if your needs scale back on any of those fronts, the more affordable S25 options, or even last year's S24 Ultra, may be worth considering. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review.\nWhy we like it\nThe reason to get the Ultra over its S25 siblings is its screen, which is truly the best I've seen on any phone, and the cameras, which are a step above what the S25 and S25 Plus have. Added video features like ability to record in Log format gets the Ultra as close as it's ever been to the iPhone in terms of professional video capture.\nWho it's best for\nIf you have a Galaxy S22 Ultra or older, the S25 Ultra will seem like a significant upgrade. It's harder to make that case for S23 Ultra owners, who, unless their phone's battery is ailing or they can score an incredible discount, should otherwise sit this one out. And for you S24 Ultra owners, you don't need this phone. Save your money and treat yourself to a nice steak dinner and a movie.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra's appeal is muddied by its $1,300 price. The regular Galaxy S25 has the same functionality, power and longevity, and it costs $500 less. Want a bigger screen? Consider the Galaxy S25 Plus. For the majority of people, the regular Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will be a better fit.\nPros\n- Thin 4.2mm design\n- 200-megapixel main camera\n- Powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor\n- Durable build\nCons\n- Steep $2,000 price tag\n- Same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's Fold\n- 25-watt wired charging\nWith the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung has finally addressed some of the key issues with its previous book-style foldables. The impressively thin build and wider, 6.5-inch cover screen makes this feel like a standard phone when closed, and that wider 8-inch inside display is great for multitasking, with the ability to run up to three apps simultaneously. Perhaps most notably, the camera gets a major upgrade with the addition of a 200-megapixel main camera, which takes shots on par with the top-of-the-line S25 Ultra.\nAltogether, it\u2019s a great choice if you want a bigger, tablet-like display without the bulk or a compromise on camera quality.\nWhy we like it\nThe Z Fold 7 does a solid job combining what's great about standard slate phones and what's great about foldables. It feels wonderfully normal to hold when closed, thanks to its sleek design and lightweight build. It also packs great cameras and has an expansive main display that's 11 percent bigger than last year's Z Fold 6.\nThankfully, a slimmer build doesn't force the battery to take a hit; the Z Fold 7 maintains that same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's foldable. That pales in comparison to batteries from Chinese competitors, but at least it's not a downgrade. The Z Fold 7 also packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor to power the many AI features you'll get onboard, from Galaxy AI photo and audio editing tools to Google's Gemini Live and Circle to Search. The phone also supports seven years of software and security updates.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're bored of standard slate phones and want something that feels a little more exciting, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a great choice. The slim design and wider cover screen helps it to feel as normal as possible when closed, with the added perk of an expansive main display that's great for multitasking and watching videos. The cameras are also impressive for a foldable that's so thin.\nWho shouldn't get it\nThe Z Fold 7's $2,000 price tag is perhaps its biggest caveat. Also, if you don't need a bigger display, it may not be worth the splurge. Ironically, the cover screen is so practical that you\u2019ll rarely need to open the phone -- unless you\u2019re watching movies or multitasking, in which case a phone like the Galaxy S25 Ultra might be a better fit.\nPros\n- Beautiful design that feels durable\n- Fun and somewhat useful AI features\n- New ultrawide camera takes good photos\n- 7 years of software updates for longevity\nCons\n- More expensive that previous Pixels and competitors\n- Doesn't feel that different from Pixel 8\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about the Pixel 9, from its respectable camera to its classy new design and lengthy 7-year timeline for software updates. But Google\u2019s phones have always shined for their clean, slick software, and that once again applies to the Pixel 9 series. Pixels are also among the first to get new software updates, making them an ideal choice for those who want to get their hands on the latest version of Android first. Aside from Android updates, Google also brings new features to Pixel phones throughout the year through updates it calls Feature Drops.\nThe Pixel 9 comes with a few new AI tricks that you may find useful, like the ability to search for content in screenshots, generate images from scratch in the Pixel Studio app and add new objects in photos. These features aren\u2019t must-haves, and they\u2019re not without flaws. Plus, at a starting price of $799, the Pixel 9 has a higher bar to live up to. But the Pixel 9 feels like it belongs in that class of device. Read our full review for the Google Pixel 9.\nWhy we like it\nThe Pixel 9 and Google's Gemini assistant still feel like a first step toward what the company is hoping to achieve: Making phone software more intelligent so that we can spend less time swiping, tapping, scrolling and digging. In the meantime, the Pixel 9 shines for its great camera, elegant design and clean software, just like the less AI-centric Pixels of years past.\nWho's it best for\nIf you're a Pixel fan upgrading from an older phone, like the Pixel 6 or earlier, you'll find a lot to love about the Pixel 9. But keep in mind that for the same price, Samsung's Galaxy S25 has a brighter screen and a dedicated telephoto lens for taking zoomed photos.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you want the absolute best cameras that Google makes, including having a dedicated telephoto lens, I'd recommend the Pixel 9 Pro.\nBest phone cameras compared\n| Product | Apple iPhone 16 Pro | Google Pixel 9 Pro | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | Apple iPhone 16 | Google Pixel 9 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,622 x 1,206 pixel resolution; 1-120Hz adapative refresh rate | 6.3-inch LTPO OLED; 2,856x1,280 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate | 6.8-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556 x 1,179 pixel resolution; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,424x1,080 pixels; 60-120 Hz variable refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 460 ppi | 495 ppi | 501 ppi | 460 ppi | 422 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches | 6x2.8x0.3 inches | 6.41 x 3.06 x 0.32 in. | 5.81 x 2.82 x 0.31 inches | 6x2.8x0.3 inches |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm | 152.8x72x8.5 mm | 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2 mm | 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm | 152.8x72x8.5 mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 199 g (7.03 oz.) | 199g (7 oz.) | 218g (7.69 oz.) | 170 g (6 oz.) | 198g (7 oz.) |\n| Mobile software | iOS 18 | Android 14 | Android 15 | iOS 18 | Android 14 |\n| Camera | 48-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) 5x telephoto | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 48-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 200-megapixel (wide), 50-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto), 50-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) |\n| Front-facing camera | 12-megapixel | 42-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 10.5-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 4K | 4K | 8K | 4K | 4K |\n| Processor | Apple A18 Pro | Google Tensor G4 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Apple A18 | Google Tensor G4 |\n| RAM + storage | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 16GB + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB |\n| Expandable storage | None (Face ID) | None | None | None (Face ID) | None |\n| Battery | Up to 27 hours video playback; up to 22 hours video playback (streamed). | 4,700 mAh | 5,000 mAh | Up to 22 hours video playback; up to 18 hours video playback (streamed). | 4,700 mAh |\n| Fingerprint sensor | None (Face ID) | Under display | Under display | None (Face ID) | Under display |\n| Connector | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C |\n| Headphone jack | None | None | None | None | None |\n| US starting price | $999 (128GB) | $999 (128GB) | $1,300 (256GB) | $799 (128GB) | $799 (128GB) |\nRecent updates\nIn July 2025, we added the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 to our list. The Fold 7 replaces last year's Fold 6 and comes with a completely new design that makes it thinner, lighter and feel more like a \"regular phone.\" It has a new main 200-megapixel camera that is similar to the one on the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nFactors to consider when looking at a phone's cameras\nConsider last year's models: Apple no longer sells the iPhone 15 Pro Max, but you can still find it at third party retailers and often for hundreds less than the iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nProtect your new phone with a case: Make your phone and its camera's last longer with a case.\nDon't overlook affordable phones: The $499 Pixel 8A and $599 iPhone 15 can do almost everything that a new premium phone can do for a fraction of the price. Save some money and still take great snaps.\nWait for sales: Many of the best phone camera systems are found on more expensive models. Look for sales and discounts around major holidays, especially Amazon's Prime Day and Cyber Monday.\nCheck if you're already invested: Have you already bought a lot of iPhone camera accessories like a case or tripod? Stick with an iPhone if you still want access to them. Make sure your new iPhone will still work with your setup.\nHow we test phones\nWe test every phone in real-world scenarios, focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new software updates, or to compare it against new phones from competitors such as Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus.\nPhotography\nPhotography is a major focus for most phones these days, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes, such as ProRes Log video that debuted with the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, or the Magic Editor photo tool that launched with the Google Pixel 8 series.\nBattery life\nBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long a phone lasts during a typical day of use and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test, as a simple, replicable measure of pure battery life, which isn't always included in the initial review but sometimes added later in an update.\nPerformance measuring\nWe use benchmarking apps to measure each phone's performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Most notable are how the graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Or do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations, and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo.\nWe perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of a particular phone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models.\nRead more: How We Test Phones\nOther phones we tested\nThe $1,400 Sony Xperia 1 V retains all the best features of previous Xperia 1 phones, like a 4K high refresh rate display, expandable storage, cutting-edge cameras with eye-tracking autofocus, a 5,000-mAh battery, a dedicated hardware shutter button and a headphone jack, all wrapped in Sony's lovely, mundane utilitarian design. The phone brims with numerous quality-of-life improvements for its target audience of creative types like photographers, filmmakers, musicians and gamers who want nuanced control over the content they make. Its $1,400 price tag keeps this phone squarely aimed beyond most consumers.\nPhone camera FAQs\nWhich phone camera is the best at night?\nAre iPhone or Samsung cameras better?\nWhat's the difference between real cameras and phone cameras?\nWhat to look forward to in 2025\nSamsung teased the Galaxy S25 Edge at its January Galaxy Unpacked event. Not much is known about the phone aside from it being slimmer than the regular Galaxy S25. Here's everything you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. There's also buzz for the next iPhone, likely called the iPhone 17 -- from a slimmer version of the upcoming device to a new screen with a higher refresh rate on baseline models. We've rounded up rumors, leaks and analysis on the iPhone 17 Air (one of several nicknames for Apple's next iPhone). Read CNET's iPhone 17 rumor roundup for more info."

The chip will continue to be manufactured with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, known as N3E, he said.\nThe ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air is expected to have an A19 chip, while the iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to have an A19 Pro chip. Both of those chips are expected to be manufactured with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process, known as N3P.\nPu also expects the iPhone 17 to be equipped with 8GB of RAM, matching the iPhone 16.\nLast month, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the iPhone 17 Air and both iPhone 17 Pro models will all be equipped with an increased 12GB of RAM. He said that Apple was still deciding on 8GB or 12GB of RAM for the iPhone 17 base model at that time, and if Pu's information is accurate, the company has settled on 8GB for the device.\nOverall, the base iPhone 17 is shaping up to be a minor upgrade over the equivalent iPhone 16, with both devices expected to have the same overall design. Key new features that are rumored for the iPhone 17 include a 120Hz display and a 24-megapixel front camera, compared to 60Hz and a 12-megapixel front camera on the iPhone 16.\nThe base iPhone 17 will also feature a slightly larger 6.3-inch display compared to the 6.1-inch iPhone 16, according to display industry expert Ross Young.\nApple is expected to unveil the entire iPhone 17 series in September.\nPopular Stories\nApple is continuing to tweak the way that the Liquid Glass design looks ahead of the iOS 26 launch, and the latest beta makes a change to the Lock Screen.\nThe Lock Screen clock has been updated with additional transparency, allowing more of the background to peek through.\nBeta 6 on left, beta 5 on right\nThe clock also has more of a 3D, floating look, which is in line with the rest of the ...\nApple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro will have a starting price that is $50 more than the iPhone 16 Pro but it will come with a minimum 256GB of storage, doubling the base capacity compared to last year's model.

The 16 Pro has the same spatial video capacity but can also shoot in 4K up to 120 frames per second -- bringing slow-motion effects to the iPhone.\nSee more: Apple iPhone 16 Pro Review: Compelling Upgrade With My Favorite iPhone Feature in Years\nIf you're looking to do more with your camera (or just zoom in at a concert without losing quality), the Pro's premium features might be tempting.\nDisplays, size and weight\nThe iPhone 16 has a 6.1-inch OLED display, while the 16 Pro's is 6.3 inches. The 16 has a 60Hz refresh rate, while the Pro has a 120Hz refresh rate, making animations, scrolling and gaming look smoother. Both have a 460 ppi pixel density and a peak brightness of 2,000 nits.\nThe iPhone 16 measures 5.81 inches tall, 2.82 inches wide and 0.31 inches thick. The 16 Pro's dimensions aren't too far off: 5.89 inches tall, 2.81 wide and 0.32 inches thick. The baseline 16 weighs 170g (6 ounces), while the Pro is 199g (7.03 ounces). The materials vary, too, with the iPhone 16 featuring an aluminum enclosure, while the 16 Pro is made with a titanium alloy.\nBoth include Dynamic Island, as well as an Action Button and Camera Control button.\nThe iPhone 16 comes in black, white, pink, teal and ultramarine, while the iPhone 16 Pro comes in black titanium, white titanium, natural titanium and desert titanium. Each are water resistant, with an IP68 rating.\nBoth support USB-C charging. There's no fingerprint sensor on either, so you'll need to use Face ID or a passcode.\nBatteries, processors and software\nApple doesn't disclose its battery capacity but says the iPhone 16 has up to 22 hours of video playback (18 hours streamed), while the 16 Pro has up to 27 hours of video playback (22 hours streamed). Both feature wired charging (Apple doesn't disclose the speed), and MagSafe wireless charging up to 25 watts with a 30-watt adapter or higher. They also support Qi2 charging, up to 15 watts.\nThe 16 is powered by an A18 chip, while the 16 Pro packs the more powerful (and aptly named) A18 Pro chip. They each come with iOS 18 and will support Apple Intelligence when it arrives later this year.\niPhone 16 and 16 Pro: Which one should you buy?\nFor the majority of people, the iPhone 16 has more than enough to offer. Its cameras are great for photos and videos. The phone runs iOS 18, boasts notable updates like customizable home screens and apps, new emoji tapbacks for iMessages and it supports for satellite texting. It even comes in a variety of bright saturated colors. The iPhone 16's biggest downside is its screen, which still has a 60Hz refresh rate and looks just OK when compared to pro iPhones. If you have an iPhone 13 or older, the iPhone 16 is a wonderful upgrade.\nBut if you're looking for even better cameras with the ability to zoom in closer to subjects or simply want a better display experience, the iPhone 16 Pro deserves a look. The phone packs enough niceties and offers creative types who are into photography and filmmaking plenty of artistic options -- though at a higher price. If you have an iPhone 12 Pro or older, than upgrading to the iPhone 16 Pro makes sense. If you're rocking an iPhone 13 Pro and the battery capacity is getting low, it's also worth considering the 16 Pro. But if you have an iPhone 14 Pro or 15 Pro, there's no need to upgrade."

      "text": "Amid the throngs of humanoid robots, car concepts and futuristic displays at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, dozens of people swarm around one particular stand. From a distance, it appears to be one of many booths showcasing yet another smartphone lineup. But a closer look reveals what everyone's eagerly trying to get their hands on: a remarkably slim phone unlike anything I've ever seen.\nOn display is Tecno's Spark Slim phone concept, a handset measuring 5.75mm thick (skinnier than a standard pencil) and weighing only 146 grams, according to the company. After waiting about 15 minutes for my turn, I pick up the coveted phone and am instantly amazed. It's light as a feather and yet doesn't feel like something I can snap in half. I do my own visual thickness test by pulling a pen out of my backpack and comparing it: the Spark Slim is, in fact, notably thinner.\nTecno isn't the only company that seems to believe slim is in. A few halls down, Samsung displays its Galaxy S25 Edge, which remains just out of reach behind a barricade, surrounded by a similarly impenetrable crowd of eager spectators. Details on that phone, from specs to release date, are just as slim as its appearance. But reports suggest we'll see it sometime this year.\nRead more: Best of MWC 2025: Affordable Phones and Cool Camera Concepts\nOppo, too, has launched the Find N5, which it calls the \"world's thinnest book-style foldable,\" measuring just 8.93mm thick when closed and 4.21mm thick when opened. The size and shape blew me away when I tested it, and helped assuage some of my reservations about the practicality and bulkiness of other foldables. And perhaps one of the biggest rumors leading up to the anticipated release of the iPhone 17 lineup is a potential iPhone \"Air,\" a thinner (and presumably lighter) version of Apple's handset.\nBut a thinner phone, while a cool flex, can lead to drawbacks. Less space often means a smaller battery, and therefore shorter battery life. Camera hardware can get scaled back, too, leading to lower image quality. Storage space can similarly take a hit. These are all major concessions for phone buyers, who still rank battery life, camera quality and storage space among their top priorities.\nPushing the limits can be disastrous, as Samsung learned when it opted to slim down the design of the Galaxy Note 7, only for devices to start smoking and for the phone to ultimately be recalled. Phone makers also have to keep durability at the forefront, especially if buyers are paying a pretty penny and expect their devices to last.\n\"You can't just be thin; you have to still have all the bells and whistles of a premium phone,\" Nabila Popal, senior director of data and analytics at IDC, tells me at MWC. \"The question is, how are OEMs [phone makers] going to achieve that without compromising the other more important features like battery and camera?\"\nThat'll be the challenge as more companies undoubtedly lean into the thin phones trend. But if it's not necessarily what consumers have asked for in droves, why bother slimming down devices?\n\"For the most part, it's an attempt for OEMs to differentiate,\" Popal says. While generative AI was the clear spotlight-grabber during last year's MWC, it's become so ubiquitous that this year, the focus has been more about strategy and implementation. Therefore, phone makers need to find a new way to stand out, and an eye-catchingly slim and appealing light device is one way to do that.\nThis approach seems to be working in places like China, where companies like Honor, Xiaomi and Huawei have all debuted slim premium devices (which often double as foldables, too). But Popal adds that just because something resonates in China doesn't necessarily mean it will in other parts of the world, as consumers in China tend to be more receptive to unique phones than they are in America. But it illustrates that, at least somewhere, slim phones are already striking a chord.\nRead more: MWC 2025: The Weirdest Phones We've Seen in Barcelona So Far\nApple releasing a thinner phone could be particularly advantageous, especially as it struggles to differentiate its iPhones from each other, says Anisha Bhatia, senior analyst of consumer platforms and devices at GlobalData.\n\"For example, the iPhone 15 Plus model currently occupies an uncertain position in Apple's lineup, wedged between the base model and the more feature-rich Pro and Pro Max versions, Bhatia says. \"This ambiguity has led to confusion among consumers, who struggle to differentiate the Plus models based on value proposition and feature set. Sales data indicates that the Plus models have underperformed in comparison to other iPhone variants.\"\nOn the other hand, something flashy like a thin iPhone is easier to distinguish, and could have a better shot at capturing the attention -- and dollars -- of shoppers.\nSo in a few year's time, will the very phones that MWC 2025 attendees eagerly crowded around be in their pockets and hands, now capturing photos of whatever is deemed the next tech innovation? Will thin phones become ubiquitous and win?\n\"Thinness is not going to be a must-have, but it is definitely a feature that makes a phone feel more premium, and it's a nice to have,\" Popal says.\nWhat was once revolutionary often becomes the norm. Just a few years ago, a bigger phone screen was considered a special feature, but has now become standard. Alternatively, foldable phones have largely stayed niche, even more than five years after the debut of the Samsung Galaxy Fold. Slim phones could go down either route; it's just too early to predict, Popal says.\nAlso, what's old is new again. The trend toward thinner phones harkens back to the popularity of Motorola's original Razr, which became a pop culture phenomenon upon its release in 2004 because of its slim build, unique shape and trendiness (who wouldn't want a hot pink phone just like Paris Hilton's??). Motorola's been working to recapture that zeitgeist by reviving the Razr phone line in the form of a foldable smartphone.\nBack to the present day, even if skinny phones don't end up going mainstream, that might not be such a bad thing, Popal suggests.\n\"I would argue, why do you want to make it the norm? Keep it niche, keep it premium,\" she says. \"The sooner it becomes a norm, the sooner the profitability goes.\"\nAnd the sooner crowds move on to swarm around the next big (or slim) thing."

      "text": "At its September 2024 Glowtime event, Apple unveiled its latest lineup of iPhone 16 handsets. These phones share a lot of new features, with the biggest differences being in size and the division between standard and premium phones. While the iPhone 16E released in 2025 corners the affordable market, the biggest iPhone 16 models remain the priciest, and there's plenty to differentiate them. Here's the iPhone 16 Plus versus the iPhone 16 Pro Max comparison.\nThe most prominent distinction between the two bigger phones is size, as they're no longer tied for the title of largest iPhone on record. The iPhone 16 Plus still has a 6.7-inch display, but the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 6.9-inch display, giving it the crown for the biggest iPhone ever made.\nSee more: Apple iPhone 16 Pro Review: Compelling Upgrade With My Favorite iPhone Feature in Years\nThat decision has knock-on effects: everything the iPhone 16 Plus is, the iPhone 16 Pro Max does a little better. That comes at a literal price, with the iPhone 16 Plus with 128GB of storage starting at $899 (\u00a3899, AU$1,599) and the iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB of storage starting at $1,199 (\u00a31,199, AU$2,149).\nMore from the Apple event\nThat's a sizable price gulf between the two, but there are a handful of things the even bigger phone packs that its now-smaller sibling doesn't. The iPhone 16 Plus has a 48-megapixel fusion camera (with a neat new 12-megapixel 2x digital zoom feature) and 48-megapixel ultrawide camera; the iPhone 16 Pro Max has that and a 12-megapixel telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom. Both phones have a 12-megapixel TrueDepth front-facing camera for selfies and FaceID.\nThe Pro Max also has a higher video ceiling, recording 4K video at 120 frames per second, which is good for converting to slow motion; the Plus tops out at 4K video with 60 frames per second. Both phones can shoot Spatial Video, the depth-focused format of videos watchable only in Apple Vision Pro, at 1080p at 30 frames per second.\nWhat the Pro Max does have over its cheaper sibling is more sensitive audio recording thanks to its four microphones over the Plus's 3. Both phones get Audio Mix, a trio of professional toggles to direct the phone to record certain sound sources over others when recording a video: in-frame captures who's speaking in front of the camera (even if people nearby are speaking off-camera), studio is built for podcasters and vloggers to make them sound like they're nestled in the sound-damped walls of a studio and cinematic combines sounds toward the front of the screen (much like a standard movie mix).\nUnsurprisingly, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a more advanced A18 Pro chipset than the iPhone 16 Plus's A18 silicon, though both support Apple Intelligence. The bigger phone has more maximum storage with 256GB, 512GB and 1TB options, while the Plus has 128GB, 256GB and 512GB configurations. Apple has not released the RAM on each model.\nWhere the Plus is 6.33x3.06x0.31 inches (160.9x77.8x7.8mm), the Pro Max is 6.42x3.06x0.32 inches (163x77.6x8.25mm). That also means the smaller phone is lighter at 199 grams (7.03 ounces), while the bigger handset is 227 grams (7.99 ounces). The Pro Max comes in a titanium frame with four colors: black, white, a silver-ish natural and a tan desert hue. The Plus has a more vibrant range of colors: black, white, pink, teal and ultramarine. Both phones are IP68 rated for dust and water resistance, and both pack USB-C ports.\nBoth phones' displays have OLED Super Retina XDR and 460 pixels-per-inch resolution, so they're equally as sharp, though the larger Pro Max logically has more pixels in its screen (2,868x1,320-pixel resolution) than the relatively smaller Plus (2,796x1,290-pixel resolution). The big difference is in display refresh rate, with the Pro Max topping out at 120 Hz with its ProMotion tech while the Plus retains the 60 Hz refresh rate that base iPhones have had for years. Both phones max out at 2,000 nits of brightness in direct sunlight, but they can dip down to a single nit in darkness, which helps preserve battery.\nThat extra space means more battery life (though in typical Apple fashion, we don't have rough hourly usage rather than exact capacity figures). The iPhone 16 Pro Max tops out at up to 33 hours of video playback (or up to 29 hours if streaming the video), while the iPhone 16 Plus has up to 27 hours of video playback (or up to 24 hours if streaming it). Both phones have the same wired charging (up to 20 watt) as the previous generation, though MagSafe wireless charging has been bumped up to 25 watts if using a 30-watt or faster charger.\nBoth phones run iOS 18 out of the box, and both will get Apple Intelligence when it drops later in September. Apple didn't reveal much more about its AI capabilities than was shown off at WWDC back in June. The generative AI will supercharge Siri, offer suggestions for spiffing up the tone of a message, automatically arrange your photos and offer more accurate contextual searches among them.\nApple's also added AI-generated emoji, which you can whip up by submitting prompts -- say, a cowboy frog on a diving board.\nThe big reveal is Visual Intelligence, which sees Apple's AI applied to the camera. Visual Intelligence is able to search for whatever is in your viewfinder. This is summoned with a new hardware feature: the Camera Control button, which is found on both phones on the right side below the lock button. It's capacitive and physically clicky, so you'll be able to push in for Visual Intelligence or tap it to bring up its second functionality: acting as an extra camera setting toggle.\nFor example, when your camera app is open, you can run your finger along it to zoom in and out or change the aperture -- and it'll work as an extra menu within third-party apps, too. The Apple presentation showed it functioning in Snap.\nSimilarly, the Action Button is now on both the premium and standard phones, taking the place of the ringer-silent switch to act as a customizable app shortcut. It's no longer exclusive to the premium handsets.\nThat shrinks the number of exclusives that the Pro Max holds over the Plus, making its $300 price differential harder to justify. True, it's larger, with a third rear camera (telephoto), titanium frame and bigger battery. But with Apple Intelligence coming to both phones (it's only drifting back to the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models), the premium phones are harder to justify over their cheaper siblings.\nFor a more detailed comparison, check our specs sheet below:\niPhone 16 Plus vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max\n| Apple iPhone 16 Plus | Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max | |\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate, brightness | 6.7-inch OLED Super Retina XDR display; 2,796 x 1,290 pixel resolution | 6.9-inch OLED Super Retina XDR display; 2,868 x 1,320 pixel resolution |\n| Pixel density | 460 ppi | 460 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 6.33 x 3.06 x 0.31 inches | 6.42 x 3.06 x 0.32 inches |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 160.9 x 77.8 x 7.8mm | 163 x 77.6 x 8.25mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 199 g, 7.03 oz | 227 g, 7.99oz |\n| Mobile software | iOS 18 | iOS 18 |\n| Camera | 48-megapixel (fusion), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 48-megapixel (fusion), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 5x telephoto |\n| Front-facing camera | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 4K at 60fps; spatial video at 1080p at 30fps | 4K up to 120fps; spatial video at 1080p at 30fps |\n| Processor | A18 | A18 Pro |\n| RAM/storage | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 256GB, 512GB, 1TB |\n| Expandable storage | No | No |\n| Battery | Up to 27 hours video playback; up to 24 hours video playback (streamed). 20W wired charging.

      "text": "Apple is expected to launch an all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air later this year, and while there have been plenty of rumors about the camera's overall design and thinness, we haven't heard any details about the device's weight and battery capacity until now.\nAccording to the leaker going by the account name \"yeux1122\" on the Korean-langauge Naver blog, the 6.6-inch iPhone 17 Air has a weight of approximately 145 grams, while the battery capacity is 2,800mAh. The details allegedly originate from a \"mass production confirmed sample.\" The blog has previously offered accurate insights into Apple's component strategy.\nThe claimed weight is similar to an iPhone SE 2 or iPhone 13 mini, which are 148 grams and 141 grams, respectively. As for the battery, the capacity figure is not unlike the iPhone 12, which has a 2,815mAh battery. However, the leaker's post does note that there remains a possibility that Apple will use a high-density battery in the iPhone 17 Air, which could increase its \"actual capacity\" by 15-20%.\nApple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in March that device will have a \"high-density\" battery. More recently, a report out of Asia has suggested that the iPhone 17 Air could become the first Apple smartphone to adopt advanced battery technology, with Apple supplier TDK preparing to ship its new generation of silicon-anode batteries by the end of June.\nHaving said that, reports have been mixed regarding the iPhone 17 Air's potential battery performance. The Information's Wayne Ma claimed the device will have \"worse\" battery life compared to previous iPhone models.\nIn internal testing, Apple apparently determined that the percentage of users who will be able to use the iPhone 17 Air for a full day without needing to recharge the device throughout the day will be between 60% and 70%, according to the report. For other iPhone models, the report said that metric is apparently between 80% and 90%.\nTo mitigate this problem, the report said that Apple is planning to release a battery case as an optional accessory for the iPhone 17 Air.\nOn the other hand, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has offered a more optimistic outlook, stating that battery life would be \"on par with current iPhones\" thanks to hardware and software optimizations.\nThe 5.5mm-thin device is also rumored to incorporate Apple's power-efficient C1 modem and lack an Ultra Wide camera, which could potentially provide more internal space for a larger battery. We'll know for sure when the device replaces the \"Plus\" model in Apple's iPhone 17 lineup, which is expected to launch around mid-September, per Apple's typical fall release schedule."

      "text": "With President Donald Trump threatening a higher 25% tariff rate for items produced in South Korea and Japan -- two major US tech suppliers -- you might be wondering if the rumored iPhone 17 or other Apple devices like MacBooks or AirPods will cost more soon.\nThe answer is... maybe. But tariffs aren't the only culprit.\nAfter Apple's initial attempts to avoid the tariffs on iPhones, which have been primarily produced in China, Trump threatened Apple and other manufacturers with a 25% tariff for all smartphones produced outside the US. But he's also delayed his self-imposed deadline for \"reciprocal tariffs,\" which could mean more time to make deals and lower tariffs before the new iPhone is introduced. However, there's still plenty about tariffs up in the air.\nIf a new iPhone does get hit with a tariff, you should expect Apple -- and other phone manufacturers -- to pass along most of that cost to you, say experts.\n\"The president's tariff would really basically just be a sales tax that would be tacked on to the cost of a new smartphone,\" said Timothy Meyer, Richard Allen/Cravath distinguished professor in international business law, Duke University School of Law. \"And the companies will probably be able to pass through most of that cost to consumers.\"\nBut even if tariffs don't affect the price, there are other reasons you'll likely pay more for the new iPhone, including the health of the US economy and the fact that a new iPhone is due for a price hike. If rumors about the iPhone 17 Air and the rest of the lineup are true, Apple could potentially say that additional features justify a higher price.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment for an earlier version of this story.\nYou likely won't find out the exact price until the new iPhone's likely September release date, but we're following all the latest leaks, rumors and speculation until then.\nRead more: Want to Buy a New iPhone? Here's Why You Should Wait\nHow tariffs could affect the cost of the rumored iPhone 17\nThere are a few tariffs that could raise iPhone prices -- tariffs on imports from other countries (a 55% tariff on imports from China and a potential 26% hike on those from India) and the 25% tariff on imported smartphones that Trump announced in May.\nIf your iPhone is made in China, that doesn't mean it will cost 80% more, though (55% plus 25%). Trump's 55% tariff on China includes a 25% tariff that has been in place since his first administration. That tax is already baked into the iPhone's price. So you'd be looking at up to a 30% increase to buy a phone imported from China. If 25% smartphone tariffs are enacted, then it could bring the price up by a total of 55%. If your phone is made in India, you could see a 26% increase in the iPhone price if a trade deal isn't reached and a 51% increase if smartphone tariffs are enacted.\nUsing the iPhone 16 as a reference, this means a base iPhone 17 model subject to import tariffs on China or India could start at just over $1,000 without a smartphone tariff, and could go up to more than $2,400 for a high-end Pro Max with a broad smartphone tariff.\nHowever, a broad iPhone tariff is unlikely to happen, according to many experts. \"My prediction would be that it's unlikely that we ever see a global smartphone tariff,\" Meyer said.\nMeyer explained that a product-specific tariff is less likely to stand up in court if Trump tries to justify it under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\nMost experts say moving iPhone production to the US is an unrealistic demand anyway, especially in the short term, because of higher labor and production costs in the US. Estimates have suggested that a US-made iPhone would cost as much as $3,500. The Trump phone, announced in June, originally boasted being made in the USA but has since dropped that language from its website.\nAnd where the new phones are assembled is only part of the tariff equation. Apple sources components for the iPhone from dozens of other countries, which could also potentially affect the price.\nRead more: Are Tariffs Hiking Prices Yet? What I've Seen Watching 11 Key Products for Changes\nHere's how much the iPhone 17 could cost\nBased on what tariffs could look like in the fall, here's how much you could pay for the next iPhone based on current iPhone 16 prices. These are our estimates and not official pricing from Apple:\nPotential iPhone price with tariffs\n| Current price | With India's 26% tariff | India tariff + 25% smartphone tariff | With China's 30% tariff | China tariff + 25% smartphone tariff | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| iPhone 16 (128GB) | $829 | $1,045 | $1,252 | $1,078 | $1,285 |\n| iPhone 16 Plus (128GB) | $929 | $1,171 | $1,403 | $1,208 | $1,440 |\n| iPhone 16 Pro (128GB) | $999 | $1,259 | $1,508 | $1,299 | $1,548 |\n| iPhone 16 Pro Max (256GB) | $1,199 | $1,511 | $1,810 | $1,559 | $1,858 |\n| iPhone 16 Pro Max (1TB) | $1,599 | $2,015 | $2,414 | $2,079 | $2,478 |\nWhat else could cause the new iPhone's price to increase?\nTrump immediately criticized retailers like Amazon and Walmart when they suggested that tariffs could result in higher prices, so it stands to reason that Apple won't directly blame tariffs for potential price hikes that could provoke a Trump tirade.\nRather, Apple could attribute the price increase to new features and design costs. Regardless of tariffs, Apple has plans to raise iPhone prices this year, The Wall Street Journal reported.\nMy colleague Patrick Holland, who's been reviewing phones for CNET since 2016, says the new iPhone is due for a price hike anyway. It's been five years since the basic iPhone model increased in price, and each iteration generally improves on features from the previous version.\nAmong the rumored iPhone 17 Pro features is improved battery life and increased RAM, which Apple could use to justify a price increase. In a post on X, Majin Bu showed a video of what looks like a thicker iPhone 17 Pro model, likely based on rumored dimensions:\nHolland notes that the base iPhone model hasn't increased in price since 2020. His research points to the standard iPhone model's price increasing approximately every five years, between $50 and $130. Based on this evidence and the iPhone 16's current price of $829, we could expect the new phones to cost between $879 and $959.\nWhat will the iPhone 17 Air cost?\nEarly rumors had the iPhone 17 Air topping the iPhone Pro in price. However, a March Bloomberg report suggested the new phone could cost about $900, similar to the current iPhone 16 Plus's price tag. Those estimates are based on the current costs and may not include the potential impact tariffs could have on an ultrathin iPhone's price.\nIn a post to X on June 23, Majin Bu showed Air dummy model in a color described as Pro Black:\nHow the economy could affect iPhone prices\nUncertainty in the US economy -- in part because of the aforementioned tariff turmoil -- has left many wary about what's to come.\nConcerns about the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have left the Federal Reserve in a wait-and-see mode for lowering interest rates. Higher interest rates can cause companies like Apple to pull back on spending and investment. Combined with higher tariffs, that pullback could lead to global supply chain disruptions. Fewer iPhones available in the market could lead to higher prices.\nIf inflation resurges, rising costs could force Apple to increase the next iPhone's price.\nOne tiny bright side, in theory, is that a weakening economy could force Apple to hold off on raising prices so it can stay competitive. But that may not offer much consolation if you're worried about spending money because of a potential recession.\nWill older iPhones cost more too?\nOne way to save on Apple products is to buy last year's model instead of the newest release. However, if the new iPhone is dramatically more expensive without enough new features to justify the hike, demand could increase for the older models. That could lead to price hikes on older models too.\nThe flip side of this is that if the new iPhone's prices rise and you have an older iPhone, your old iPhone would also likely increase in value, Holland said.\nTrading or selling a used iPhone can help offset the cost if you do decide to buy the new iPhone.\nOther ways Apple could raise prices\nEven if Apple decides to keep the price of the next iPhone steady, the tech giant can recoup increased costs in other ways.\nApple could potentially offset the impact of tariffs by raising the price of its services, including its music, news and data plans, according to supply chain expert Joe Hudicka.\n\"We'll see those markups in the subscription services first because they'll appear smaller,\" he said. \"Consumers will still pay, just not all at once.\"\nShould we believe rumors and speculation about iPhone prices?\nSo seriously, how much is a new iPhone going to cost? The truth is, we can't say with any certainty what the final numbers will be. Our assessments are based on ever-changing tariff policies, past pricing trends, rumors and leaks that are sometimes based on insider knowledge. But until Apple releases the rumored iPhone 17, we can only offer our best estimates for the final price tag."

      "text": "The official iOS 26 public beta is out now for anyone to try but it's not the latest version available. No, that's reserved exclusively for the developer beta, and Apple has just released the fifth version. It brings a few new design tweaks, bug fixes and smoother animations. It mostly seems like a polishing of the last version.\nThe biggest news in iOS 26 is Liquid Glass, Apple's new cohesive design language across all its devices, as well as two long anticipated phone features -- Call Screening picks up unknown numbers on your behalf, asks why callers are calling and shows a live transcript so you can decide whether to answer the call; while its sidekick, Hold Assist, listens to hold music for you and alerts you the instant a real person is available.\nBy jumping straight from iOS 18 to iOS 26, Apple is aligning its mobile OS naming with the rest of its platforms and signaling a generational leap rather than the usual annual tune-up. It's the biggest OS update since iOS 7, with updates and enhancements to nearly every facet of the iPhone.\nIf you want to try out any of these features, you can do so right now. Here's how you can download the iOS 26 developer beta.\nWarning: Download the iOS 26 developer beta at your own risk\nYes, the iOS 26 developer beta is free, but remember it's meant for developers, not day-to-day use. Early builds often carry bugs that can crash apps, drain your battery, overheat your phone and generally make your device feel sluggish. Unless you need to test software against Apple's next release, it's smarter to stick with the public beta, which should be released very soon, on your main iPhone.\nWhich iPhone models support iOS 26?\nAs long as you own an iPhone 11 or newer, you can download iOS 26. That means the iPhone XR/XS generation is out, while every A13 Bionic handset forward, including the forthcoming iPhone 17 models, are included. Here's the full list of compatible iPhone models that can run iOS 26:\n- iPhone 11\n- iPhone 11 Pro\n- iPhone 11 Pro Max\n- iPhone 12\n- iPhone 12 Mini\n- iPhone 12 Pro\n- iPhone 12 Pro Max\n- iPhone 13\n- iPhone 13 Mini\n- iPhone 13 Pro\n- iPhone 13 Pro Max\n- iPhone SE (second generation and later)\n- iPhone 14\n- iPhone 14 Plus\n- iPhone 14 Pro\n- iPhone 14 Pro Max\n- iPhone 15\n- iPhone 15 Plus\n- iPhone 15 Pro\n- iPhone 15 Pro Max\n- iPhone 16\n- iPhone 16 Plus\n- iPhone 16 Pro\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max\n- iPhone 17 series (as yet unannounced)\nApple Intelligence works only on compatible phones, which include any iPhone 16 model and the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.\nHow to prepare your iPhone to install the iOS 26 developer beta\nBefore you get too excited and start downloading the iOS 26 developer beta, there are a few things you need to do:\n- Check your hardware first. This beta runs only on iPhone 11 and newer. If you want the headline Apple Intelligence features, you'll need an iPhone 15 Pro, 15 Pro Max or anything in the forthcoming iPhone 17 lineup.\n- Update to the latest public release. Make sure your phone is already on the most current stable build (right now that's iOS 18.5). This helps prevent any issues that arise from updating with outdated software.\n- Have a good Wi-Fi connection. You want the install to go flawlessly, which means you should be connected to some pretty decent Wi-Fi.\n- Have enough space on your phone. You need at least 15GB of space on your phone to download the iOS 26 developer beta.\n- Archive a backup. A normal iCloud backup can be overwritten; you need one that can't. On your Mac, connect your iPhone, open Finder, select your device, hit Back Up Now > Manage Backups, right-click the new backup and click Archive. On Windows, it's pretty similar. Open iTunes, click Back Up Now, locate the backup in Preferences and archive it.\n- Know the escape hatch. If the beta breaks your phone for any reason (this has never happened to me), you'll have to put the phone in Recovery Mode, restore iOS 18.5, and then pull that archived backup back onto the device.\nOnce you've followed these steps, you're pretty much ready to go.\nHow to install the iOS 26 developer beta on your iPhone\nApple now lets anyone install developer betas without paying the $99 annual fee. To do so, visit the Apple Developer site on the device you plan to update, open the \u2630 menu, choose Account, and sign in with that device's Apple ID. Agree to the terms, tick the required boxes and tap Submit. You may also need to enable Developer Mode in Settings > Privacy and Security.\nNow you can install the iOS 26 developer beta on your phone as an over-the-air update:\n- After you sign up for the Apple Developer program, you should see the option to download the iOS 26 developer beta in your settings.\n- On your device, open Settings > General > Software Update > Beta Updates and choose the iOS 26 Developer Beta.\n- Go back and tap Download and Install under the new \"iOS 26 Developer Beta\" option that appears.\nFinally, punch in your passcode, accept the T&C and let the installer do its thing. On a decent Wi-Fi connection, the download-and-reboot routine should take roughly 10 to 15 minutes, but that may vary. When your iPhone powers back on, you'll be running the iOS 26 developer beta."

      "text": "The iPhone 17 \u201cSlim\u201d (as some are taking to calling it) is one of the more interesting rumors to pop out of Cupertino in a while. The gist of it is that, in the fall of next year, Apple will introduce a new ultra-thin iPhone in addition to some of the usual lineup.\nThe rumors keep changing and evolving into a picture of an iPhone unlike any we\u2019ve seen so far. The latest rumors come from a Medium post by Ming-Chi Kuo, a noted supply chain analyst who has often been right with past leaks (but whose record has been more mixed recently).\nKuo says the new ultra-slim iPhone is expected to \u201cemphasize innovative form factor design rather than competing on hardware specifications.\u201d To that end, he claims these are the specs of the slim iPhone 17 that he knows about so far:\n- Screen size: Approximately 6.6 inches\n- Screen resolution: Approximately 2740 by 1260 pixels\n- Processor: A19 chip (with the higher-end iPhones using the A19 Pro)\n- Dynamic Island area: Similar to current models\n- Metal frame: Adoption of a titanium-aluminum alloy metal frame, with a lower percentage of titanium than the current Pro and Pro Max metal frames (with other iPhone 17 models using aluminum metal frames)\n- 5G chip: Adoption of Apple\u2019s in-house 5G chip\n- Camera: Single rear camera (wide camera)\nMost of it lines up with previous rumors: a screen size not quite as large as the Pro Max variants but close, Dynamic Island etc.\nThis is the second time we\u2019ve heard it will use the lower-end A19 chip not the Pro version from the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. Without knowing the differences between them, it\u2019s hard to say if that\u2019s a big deal or not.\nThe most notable new details are that the phone will use Apple\u2019s own in-house 5G chip, which is now years behind schedule and seems to never quite get over the finish line. If it\u2019s ready for what will likely be a premium, expensive phone by next fall, that\u2019s certainly news.\nBut one rear camera? No ultra-wide nor telephoto? That feels like a big step back, no matter what the priorities of this phone are.\nKuo doesn\u2019t dive into price, which has previously been rumored to be everything from \u201csimilar to the iPhone 17 Plus would be\u201d to \u201cmore expensive than the iPhone 17 Pro Max.\u201d\nBefore the iPhone 17 arrives, we\u2019re expecting the iPhone 16 and iPhone SE 4 to launch. iPhone 16 will arrive at a September launch event \u2013 find out how to watch the Apple September event live stream.

      "text": "Anticipation is high for the launch of the next iPhone, and so are expectations.\nRumors have been swirling for months about the upcoming lineup, which most notably may include a thinner model dubbed the iPhone 17 Air. But speculation isn't stopping there; what Apple reveals this fall could hint at what it has in store for next year, too.\nThin phones are undoubtedly having a moment, with companies like Samsung, Huawei, Honor and Oppo debuting slimmer devices in the name of novelty -- and slapping on higher price tags. The iPhone 17 Air, which could make its debut in September alongside the rest of the iPhone 17 series, is rumored to have a 5.5mm-thick profile and a 6.6-inch screen. It would allow Apple to capitalize on the skinny phone hype while also diverting attention from its fledgling AI efforts.\nIt might also help to silence critics who say the iPhone's design has become too predictable in recent years \u2013 though consumers don't seem to be demanding skinny phones as much as other attributes like better cameras and longer battery life.\n\"The trend towards thinner smartphones is not necessarily driven by consumer demand,\" notes Anisha Bhatia, senior analyst at GlobalData. \"Slimness is a factor that can be clearly marketed, unlike uncertain use cases for AI.\"\nReleasing the iPhone 17 Air is also a chance for Apple to mark up the price of its thinner handset, Bhatia notes. Charging more for an innovative design could be a more straightforward pitch than trying to monetize a phone's AI features, especially since platforms like Gemini and ChatGPT have free tiers -- and the smarter, Apple Intelligence-powered Siri that Apple promised in 2024 has yet to arrive.\nBut there might be more to Apple's long-term plan than simply releasing a slimmer iPhone 17. In fact, Samsung's mobile strategy this year, namely the release of the Galaxy S25 Edge in May followed by the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in July, could paint a picture of what might be in Apple's blueprint, too.\nA page out of Samsung's book(-style foldable)\nSamsung's debut of the $1,100 Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year was met with general skepticism -- even, admittedly, by me. What exactly is the point of a thinner phone? But once I held and tested the device, I began to understand the thinking behind it: A slim, lightweight phone actually does feel drastically more comfortable to use and carry around. And the impressive 200-megapixel main camera to match the top-of-the line S25 Ultra certainly helps.\nBut it wasn't until the $2,000 Galaxy Z Fold 7 was unveiled a couple months later that it all really began to click. That phone takes the S25 Edge's slim design and repackages it into a foldable that feels remarkably like a normal slate phone when folded shut.\nSimilarly, Apple could release the iPhone 17 Air to not only demonstrate its hardware advancements, but to also lay the groundwork for its long-rumored foldable, which reports suggest could come out in September 2026 and cost around $2,000.\n\"We won't be surprised if Apple follows a similar path where it first launches a thin iPhone and then, using that, launches a potentially thin foldable,\" said Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC.\nIf Apple does follow Samsung's template, it should also ensure a slim foldable iPhone doesn't compromise on essential features consumers expect like battery life, Popal says. She adds that minimizing the screen's crease (which Apple is reportedly doing in partnership with Samsung Display) can help it stand out.\nSamsung, Google and several Chinese companies may have beaten Apple to the foldables punch, but that's not all that matters. Apple has a history of rolling out products well after its competitors. For instance, the iPhone debuted years after the launch of smartphones from companies like BlackBerry and Palm, and MP3 players, tablets and smartwatches existed well before the iPod, iPad and Apple Watch. Still, Apple quickly dominated those spaces -- and it's possible the rollout of a foldable iPhone could follow suit.\n\"When Apple does come out [with a new device], they tend to come out louder and do it better,\" Popal said. \"It's like making an entrance to the party late, but then stealing the show. They tend to do that, and that's why no one ever minds them showing up late.\"\nStill, the clock is ticking for Apple to join its competitors and prove that it's still serious about innovation. For years, rumors swirled about an iPhone Flip, similar to the clamshell devices from Samsung and Motorola. But it appears that's no longer on the immediate roster, as Apple potentially eyes that larger -- and likely more expensive -- book-style foldable. It also faces mounting pressure due to its slower rollout of Apple Intelligence, which is still leagues behind what competitors like Samsung and Google have loaded onto their devices.\nBut it's not too late for Apple to make a statement. Foldables remain a niche category, and Apple's entry could give the form factor a significant boost, thanks to the company's scores of loyal fans and its tendency to usher innovation into well-established categories. It also has the advantage of learning secondhand the hard lessons that Android manufacturers had to absorb as they pushed to make their foldables thinner, more powerful and more durable. Apple can take those findings and any accompanying consumer feedback and make a bigger impact.\n\"It's OK if you come late to the party,\" Popal said, \"but then you better make a grand entrance.\""

      "text": "President Donald Trump announced he has made a deal with China, which could potentially affect the cost of a new iPhone -- but maybe not as much as you think.\n\"WE ARE GETTING A TOTAL OF 55% TARIFFS, CHINA IS GETTING 10%,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social, noting that he and China's president, Xi Jinping, still need to give their final approval for the deal.\nHowever, 55% \"total\" tariff incorporates 30% the countries agreed to in May (10% \"reciprocal tariff\" + 20% \"fentanyl tariff\") and approximately 25% from tariffs that Trump imposed on China during his first term, according to a White House official.\nAlthough 55% is substantially less than the original 145% tariff against China Trump originally put in place, it's still likely to result in higher prices for many items, said Michael Coon, associate professor of economics at the University of Tampa. And the new tariff deal doesn't take into account the 25% smartphone tariff Trump announced shortly after Apple said it was moving production of US iPhones to India.\n\"I would suspect that the 25% smartphone tariff would be added on top of the existing tariffs in China,\" he said. \"I think the smartphone tariff is more reaction to India -- Apple's announcement that they were going to ship most of their production to India.\"\nApple didn't mention tariffs during its Worldwide Developers Conference this week, but with the rumored iPhone 17 due for a price hike -- regardless of tariffs -- is now the time to buy a new iPhone?\nRead more: Thinking About Buying a New iPhone? Here's Why You Should Wait\nHow much could tariffs raise iPhone prices? We do the math\nCompanies don't always pass the full tariff onto customers in the form of higher prices, but they can. Even if Apple could absorb some of the costs, you should expect to see significant price jumps if tariffs take effect.\n\"They're still going to probably pass 80% to 90% onto consumers, if they can,\" Coon said. \"Unless they wanted to do some sort of marketing ploy out of it, which I don't suspect they would want to do, because that would be directly going up against the administration.\"\nBased on the current tariff rate, iPhones manufactured in China are already subject to a 25% tariff (from Trump's first term), but could now get an additional 30% tariff. Goods from India currently have a 10% baseline tariff but that could potentially soar to 26% next month. Here's how the current tariffs and potential 25% Apple tariff could affect the price of the iPhone. These figures are based on our estimates and not confirmed by Apple:\nHow much could iPhones made in China cost after tariffs?\n| Current price | With new 30% tariff | New tariff + 25% smartphone tariff | |\n| iPhone 16e (128GB) | $599 | $779 | $928 |\n| iPhone 16 (128GB) | $829 | $1,078 | $1,285 |\n| iPhone 16 Plus (128GB) | $929 | $1,208 | $1,440 |\n| iPhone 16 Pro (128GB) | $999 | $1,299 | $1,548 |\n| iPhone 16 Pro Max (256GB) | $1,199 | $1,559 | $1,858 |\n| iPhone 16 Pro Max (1TB) | $1,599 | $2,079 | $2,478 |\nHow much could iPhones made in India cost after tariffs?\n| Current price | Current 10% tariff | Potential 26% tariff | Potential 26% tariff + 25% smartphone tariff | |\n| iPhone 16e (128GB) | $599 | $659 | $755 | $904 |\n| iPhone 16 (128GB) | $829 | $912 | $1,045 | $1,252 |\n| iPhone 16 Plus (128GB) | $929 | $1,022 | $1,171 | $1,403 |\n| iPhone 16 Pro (128GB) | $999 | $1,099 | $1,259 | $1,508 |\n| iPhone 16 Pro Max (256GB) | $1,199 | $1,319 | $1,511 | $1,810 |\n| iPhone 16 Pro Max (1TB) | $1,599 | $1,759 | $2,015 | $2,414 |\nBased on Coon's estimates that Apple could pass along up to 90% of the tariff cost to customers, that could raise the price of a new iPhone 16 Pro Max (1 TB) assembled in China to $2,230.\n\"Estimates say it would cost $3,500 to produce an iPhone in the US. So, it would still be cheaper to produce in China,\" Coon said.\nThere's a lot more that goes into the price of an iPhone than simply where it's assembled. Apple sources components for its products from a long list of countries, which could face higher tariffs after the pause. And a tariff on goods doesn't necessarily mean prices will increase by the same amount. If companies want to stay competitive, they could absorb some of the costs to keep their prices lower.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\nWhen could we see iPhone prices increase?\nIt's unclear exactly when prices could go up, but if companies sell out of devices produced before the tariffs, they may have to increase prices on products in tariffed shipments.\nHowever, even if Apple can't avoid tariffs entirely, it has ways to offset the impact through its services -- including its music, news and data plans -- according to supply chain expert Joe Hudicka.\n\"Apple will likely absorb some of the tariff costs up front to keep sticker prices stable, then pass the rest on to consumers gradually through service bundles, device longevity and ecosystem upgrades,\" he said. \"Consumers will still pay, just not all at once.\"\nAnd regardless of how the tariff drama plays out, the Wall Street Journal reports that Apple plans to raise iPhone prices later this year. So expect prices to go up soon.\nIs it better to buy an iPhone and other tech now or wait?\nIf you already planned to buy a new smartphone, buying it now might save you money. But if you don't need a new phone immediately, you might want to wait, said CNET Managing Editor Patrick Holland, who's been reviewing phones for CNET since 2016.\n\"If iPhone prices rise, know that, like cars, the prices for used iPhones will likely rise, too,\" he said. \"If Apple does raise its prices, you'll likely get more for your old iPhone when you trade it in, and that should offset any increased prices.\"\nIf you don't have the cash on hand and are considering using a credit card or buy now, pay later plan just to avoid tariffs, make sure you have the money to cover the costs before you start accruing interest. With credit cards' average interest rates currently more than 20%, the cost of financing a big purchase could quickly wipe out any savings you'd get by buying before prices go up because of tariffs.\n\"If you finance this expense on a credit card and can't pay it off in full in one to two months, you'll likely end up paying way more than a tariff would cost you,\" said Alaina Fingal, an accountant, founder of The Organized Money and a CNET Money Expert Review Board member. \"I would recommend that you pause on any big purchases until the economy is more stable.\"\nOne way to save on Apple products, even if prices go up, is to buy last year's model instead of the newest release or a used one. And trading or selling a used one can help offset the cost even more.\n\"Apple has leaned into that with its Certified Refurbished program, much like the auto industry's used car model,\" Hudicka said. \"This program helps extend the lifespan of devices, keeping customers in the Apple ecosystem longer while distributing the cost impact over time.\""

But Apple's new iPhones find small and clever ways to bring a bit more speed and efficiency to our everyday lives, as I found during about a week of hands-on testing.\nBetween the new Camera Control key for quickly snapping photos and adjusting shooting modes, the Action button for programming shortcuts, and the upcoming notification summary feature in Apple Intelligence, everyday tasks feel a little faster and less tedious on the iPhone 16 -- and not just from a processing power standpoint.\nRead more: Apple iPhone 16 Pro Review: Compelling Upgrade, and My Favorite Feature in Years\nThat's been a theme throughout the smartphone industry this year, as tech giants have raced to incorporate more AI into their devices in the name of simplifying how we use our phones (and capitalizing on the biggest new tech trend, of course).\nFor Apple, the entire picture isn't clear just yet. While Apple is touting its new iPhone 16 family as being the first devices built for Apple Intelligence (although last year's iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will support it too), the company's suite of AI features won't start rolling out officially until next month. It's impossible to know whether Apple Intelligence will be impactful enough to justify upgrading, but previewing the new features has at least given me a sense of Apple's direction.\nFor now, the Camera Control button and Action button are the most significant changes on this year's standard iPhone. I don't think either one is worth upgrading your phone for if you weren't already planning to. But between these new buttons, iOS 18 and the Dynamic Island, it feels like Apple is slowly transforming the iPhone's interface into something more customizable and efficient. Those upgrading from an iPhone that's at least two to three years old will notice improvements to the camera and battery too.\nRead more: Best iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro cases\nNow that I've spent a few days alternating between the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus as my everyday phone, here are my top takeaways.\nSay hello to the iPhone 16's new buttons\nSmartphones have served as our go-to cameras for the past decade. And now, in its 16th generation, Apple has given the iPhone its own dedicated button for snapping photos and recording videos. It's tempting to just call the Camera Control key another button, but truthfully it's more complex than that.\nCamera Control is like a button and a touchpad in one. Pressing it launches the camera, and pressing again snaps a photo, while holding it will record a video. But here's where the interesting part comes in: a lighter press will pull up a carousel of settings and shooting modes that you can swipe through by sliding your finger across the button. This mini-menu includes options for controlling the exposure, depth, zoom, switching between different camera lenses, and changing the tone or applying photographic styles. Once you tap into a particular setting, you can adjust it by sliding your finger along the Camera Control area.\nIt may seem minor, but it feels like Apple has built a new miniature interface just for the camera, and it's a lot of fun to play around with. Between the Camera Control button and the Dynamic Island, it's nice to see Apple updating the iPhone's interface for two of the things we do the most on our phones: taking photos and switching between apps.\nBut the challenge behind Camera Control is that it requires you to build a new habit. I have to admit, I still find myself instinctively reaching for the camera button on my lock screen instead of the Camera Control button when taking a photo. Launching the camera already takes almost no time, so you could argue that it's a problem that didn't need solving. As much as I love the idea of the Camera Control button, I also worry that it could end up being ignored much like the MacBook Pro's touch bar.\nThe idea of using a button as a shortcut for launching the camera also isn't new; you could already do this with the Action button on last year's iPhone 15 Pro. Samsung's Galaxy phones also let you launch the camera by double pressing the side button, and certain Sony Xperia phones already include a dedicated shutter button.\nThat's why I think the real benefit behind Camera Control isn't the ability to launch the camera but the way you can easily swipe through different options and modes. It's easier to adjust settings while keeping your shot consistent since your finger isn't obscuring the screen, and you don't have to move your other hand to toggle between shooting modes.\nStill, the most fascinating part of Camera Control isn't arriving until later this year, and that's Visual Intelligence. When this feature launches, you'll be able to point the iPhone 16's camera at an object or location in your environment to learn more about it, like a restaurant to learn its hours, for example. The Visual Intelligence interface also has dedicated on-screen buttons for accessing Google and ChatGPT in case you want to add images to prompts for those services.\nAgain, you could argue this isn't a problem that needs solving. But it feels like the first step toward Apple building a more AI-centric interface, and that feels exciting -- although I'm reserving judgment until I've had the chance to try it.\nCamera Control isn't the only new button arriving on the base iPhone model. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus also inherit the Action button from last year's Plus models, giving you a customizable shortcut key. You can program this button to launch the flashlight, record a voice memo, run a Shortcut or recognize a song among many other options.\nThe Action button isn't a reason to run out and upgrade your iPhone, but I do appreciate the level of personalization it brings, especially when combined with Apple's Shortcuts app. As I've written in the past, I've programmed mine to place my last order from the Dunkin' location near my job using Shortcuts, which comes in handy when I'm commuting to the office and want to grab a quick coffee.\nHowever, I would have liked to see more from the Action button this time around. Apple made some useful updates to the Action button with iOS 18, such as the ability to access device controls using the button. You can also customize the button further with the Shortcuts app by changing the button's function depending on certain factors, like the time of day.\nBut I'd still like to be able to program more than one action simultaneously using different gestures (i.e. single press for one action, double press for another), especially considering WatchOS 11 makes it possible to switch between actions on the Apple Watch Ultra by pressing and holding the Action button.\nThe iPhone 16 pops in new colors, but is missing a key Pro feature\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus look a lot like last year's iPhones, but with a couple of minor changes. For one, the cameras are now stacked vertically instead of being situated diagonally, which enables them to capture spatial photos and videos for viewing in Apple's Vision Pro headset.\nThey also come in a colorful range of bright colors, unlike the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, which are available in more muted hues. If you're going for the iPhone 16 or 16 Plus, you'll have the option of pink, teal, ultramarine (blue), white or black. I've been using the pink iPhone 16 Plus and ultramarine iPhone 16, and I've avoided putting a case on them for as long as possible because I've wanted to show off their vibrant shades. Like the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, these phones also have a color-infused glass back that gives them a frosted look.\nThe iPhone 16 has a 6.1-inch screen, while the iPhone 16 Plus has a 6.7-inch display, matching the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus. While Apple has closed the gap between its Pro and standard models in recent years, especially by bringing the Dynamic Island and the Action button to its lower-priced iPhones, there's one upgrade I'm still waiting for: the always-on display.\nIt's the one \"Pro\" feature I truly miss on a daily basis when switching from the iPhone 15 Pro to the iPhone 16. Like the Action button, the ability to see the time and other information at a glance without having to touch my phone should be standard across new iPhones. After all, it's been widely available on Android phones for years.\nPhotographic Styles is my favorite iPhone 16 camera upgrade\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus get the camera upgrades you'd expect from a next generation phone, such as support for macro mode, an improved ultrawide camera with better low light photography and what Apple claims is a 2x optical quality zoom thanks to the phone's 48-megapixel Fusion camera.\nBut that's not what impressed me the most about the iPhone 16's camera. Instead, it's the new version of Apple's Photographic Styles that stood out to me. Photographic Styles, which are different visual effects that can be applied to photos, have been around since the iPhone 13. But the company updated it to better identify skin undertones, colors, highlights and shadows, and the difference is huge. You can cycle through different Photographic Styles when previewing a photo before pressing the shutter (which is a breeze with the Camera Control button), or you can apply an effect after the fact.\nIt makes the old version of Photographic Styles feel limiting and basic by comparison. For someone like me who doesn't have a background in photography or video editing, it helped me create dramatic, striking images with little more than just the press of a button. I particularly liked the more dramatic looks, such as the vibrant option and the stark black and white choice.\nTake a look at some of my favorite Photographic Styles photos taken with the iPhone 16 below.\nOtherwise, I was also impressed by the improvements in the ultrawide camera, which is much better at capturing photos in dim scenarios. Take a look at the image below taken with the ultrawide camera at an outdoor dinner party at night. The iPhone 16's photo is dramatically brighter than the iPhone 15's. However, I thought the Google Pixel 9 took a slightly better image that was a touch brighter and kept the subjects in focus even though they were moving.\nApple iPhone 16 (ultrawide)\nApple iPhone 15 (ultrawide)\nGoogle Pixel 9 (ultrawide)\nYou can also now take macro photos on the iPhone 16, resulting in more detailed photos when capturing close-up images. Take a look at these photos of a rose shot on the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 to see the difference.\niPhone 16 (macro)\niPhone 15\nI couldn't see much of a difference in zoom quality between the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16, although the Pixel 9's zoomed-in shot seemed much clearer. Even though the iPhone 16's max digital zoom is closer than the Pixel 9's (10x versus 8x), Google preserved more detail with less noise.\niPhone 16 (10x zoom)\nGoogle Pixel 9 (8x zoom)\nBut when it comes to photos of people, the iPhone 16 wins against the Pixel 9 and Samsung Galaxy S24. The iPhone 16 did the best job at capturing accurate skin tones and detail, while images from the Galaxy S24 and Pixel 9 looked softer and had a blue hue to them.\nApple iPhone 16\nSamsung Galaxy S24\nGoogle Pixel 9\nOverall, the iPhone 16 shines for the way it takes photos of people, whether you're shooting in the standard camera mode or applying a Photographic Style, even if the Pixel 9 is sometimes better in low light or zoomed-in circumstances.\nThose who rely on their iPhones for recording media will appreciate the iPhone 16's new Audio Mix feature, which lets you edit a video after the fact to isolate a person's voice, provide a studio recording effect or give voices a more cinematic feel. I applied the in-frame voice isolation option to a video I recorded in the bustling Ferry Building in San Francisco, where there was a ton of echo and background noise from other patrons. To my surprise, Audio Mix did a fantastic job of elevating my voice despite all the noise, which you can listen to in the video review embedded in this story.\niPhone 16 battery life, performance and Apple Intelligence\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus run on Apple's A18 processor, which performed smoothly and swiftly whether I was playing games, launching apps or scrolling through settings menus and photos. But the real draw behind the A18 is its ability to power Apple Intelligence. I've only been able to try these features in preview as part of Apple's iOS 18.1 developer beta, and not all features are part of the beta yet.\nWith that in mind, it's impossible to evaluate how much Apple Intelligence brings to the iPhone experience or whether it's a reason to upgrade your phone. But there's already one feature that stands out to me: text message and notification summaries. Apple Intelligence can provide summaries of text messages and multiple notifications from the same app in a row, which feels like a practical application of AI.\nThese summaries aren't perfect; sometimes it feels like they're missing context. For example, in one message thread with a couple of friends asking about where to get dinner, the summary phrased the restaurant suggestions a little oddly by saying: \"Open to Thai Diner; Katz's will be had later.\"\nFrom reading that summary, I could tell that my friends were deciding between Thai Diner and Katz's Delicatessen, but the \"Katz's will be had later\" part threw me off. Once I opened the message, I realized my friend, who is only in town for a few days, said he was planning to go to Katz's Delicatessen another time.\nBut remember, it's just a preview in beta. There were also plenty of other times where I was able to get everything I needed to know from these summaries without having to open Slack or the Messages app.\nSiri is also getting a big upgrade as part of Apple Intelligence. In addition to a more modern look with a glowing border, Apple's virtual helper is better at understanding commands even when you stumble over your words, similar to Google's Gemini Live. It can also provide tech advice if there's a specific feature or setting you're trying to accomplish on your phone.\nDuring my tests so far, Siri did a good job at understanding my questions even when I stuttered or stumbled, but it wasn't always consistent. To trip up Siri, I tried asking about the main character from the FX drama comedy series The Bear, which I accidentally called The Chef before correcting myself midsentence.\nOn the first try, Siri knew what I meant and provided information about Jeremy Allen White, the actor who plays the main character Carmy Berzatto. But the next time I tried a similar request, Siri answered with information about Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, the University of Alabama football coach who died in 1983, played by Gary Busey in a film of the same name.\nSiri's not wrong; that biopic does exist, and it is called The Bear, so the mix-up is understandable. But even when I threw the word \"show\" in my request, it still turned up results about this movie.\nThere's a lot more in Apple Intelligence, from the ability to create Memories in the Photos app with a prompt, email summaries and writing tools for rewriting, summarizing or proofreading text. I'll have more thoughts on Apple Intelligence once I've had more time with it and when more features become available in the full version.\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have larger batteries than their predecessors, and based on my experience, they're more than enough to get you through a regular day of use. On a normal day that involved commuting to the office and doing basic tasks like checking email, sending Slack messages and taking some photos, I had 62% of my iPhone 16 Plus' battery left after about 14 hours of use.\nBut on a very busy day during which I went sightseeing around San Francisco, had the screen brightness cranked up high, and took a lot of photos and some videos, the iPhone 16 Plus was down to 43% after about 10 hours of use. It's worth noting that the iPhone 16 Plus was running on iOS 18 and didn't have access to Apple Intelligence.\nThe iPhone 16, which was running the iOS 18.1 developer beta with Apple Intelligence at the time of testing, also showed promising battery life. After about 16 hours of use on a day that involved using Google Maps while commuting, streaming music and checking email and notifications, the battery was down to 50% by the time I went to bed.\nI'll have more impressions on the iPhone 16's battery after I've had time to run CNET's battery tests.\nApple also improved the wireless charging speeds for the iPhone 16, but only when charging with a MagSafe charger paired with a 30-watt power adapter. The difference is noticeable but minimal, with the iPhone 16 gaining an additional 6% of its battery compared to the iPhone 15 over the course of 30 minutes.\nIt's a shame that Apple didn't make any improvements to wired charging considering its claims of replenishing 50% of the battery in 30 minutes (for the non-Plus model) with a 20-watt adapter hasn't changed in years.\nThe iPhone 16 is all about the small things\nThe days of upgrading your phone every year for the one big new feature are far behind us, and the iPhone 16 is proof. And that's not a bad thing. Instead, the iPhone 16 is about how all the small things come together to result in a phone that feels faster, more intuitive and more customizable than years past.\nI wouldn't recommend buying the iPhone 16 just for the Camera Control button or the better ultrawide camera. But when you think about how the Camera Control key, the Action button and the Dynamic Island come together, along with the camera and battery improvements Apple has made over the last several years, you have a compelling upgrade for someone coming from an older phone.\nBut the next few months will be as important as ever, considering Apple Intelligence hasn't started rolling out officially yet. While some of the early features show promise, we still have yet to see how big of a leap forward the iPhone 16 truly is.\nHow we test phones\nEvery phone tested by CNET's reviews team was actually used in the real world. We test a phone's features, play games and take photos. We examine the display to see if it's bright, sharp and vibrant. We analyze the design and build to see how it is to hold and whether it has an IP-rating for water resistance. We push the processor's performance to the extremes using standardized benchmark tools like GeekBench and 3DMark, along with our own anecdotal observations navigating the interface, recording high-resolution videos and playing graphically intense games at high refresh rates.\nAll the cameras are tested in a variety of conditions from bright sunlight to dark indoor scenes. We try out special features like night mode and portrait mode and compare our findings against similarly priced competing phones. We also check out the battery life by using it daily as well as running a series of battery drain tests.\nWe take into account additional features like support for 5G, satellite connectivity, fingerprint and face sensors, stylus support, fast charging speeds and foldable displays, among others that can be useful. We balance all of this against the price to give you the verdict on whether that phone, whatever price it is, actually represents good value. While these tests may not always be reflected in CNET's initial review, we conduct follow-up and long-term testing in most circumstances.\nApple's iPhone 16 lineup\n| Apple iPhone 16 | Apple iPhone 16 Plus | Apple iPhone 16 Pro | Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, resolution, refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556x1,179 pixels; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.7-inch OLED; 2,796x1,290 pixels; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,622x1,206 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.9-inch OLED; 2,868x1,320 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 5.81 x 2.82 x 0.31 inches | 6.33 x 3.06 x 0.31 inches | 5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches | 6.42 x 3.06 x 0.32 inches |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm | 160.9 x 77.8 x 7.8mm | 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm | 163 x 77.6 x 8.25mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 170g (6 oz) | 199g (7.03 oz) | 199g (7.03 oz) | 227g (7.99 oz) |\n| Mobile software | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 18 |\n| Camera | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 48-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 12-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 48-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 12-megapixel (5x telephoto) |\n| Front-facing camera | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 4K up to 60fps; spatial video at 1080p at 30fps | 4K up to 60fps; spatial video at 1080p at 30fps | 4K up to 120fps; spatial video at 1080p at 30fps | 4K up to 120fps; spatial video at 1080p at 30fps |\n| Processor | Apple A18 | Apple A18 | Apple A18 Pro | Apple A18 Pro |\n| RAM/storage | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 256GB, 512GB, 1TB |\n| Expandable storage | No | No | No | No |\n| Battery | Up to 22 hours video playback; up to 18 hours video playback (streamed). 20W wired charging.

      "text": "I popped into the Verizon store the other day and saw a startling number of people buying a new iPhone 16. It took everything in me not to chime in with, \"Are you sure you don't want to wait and see what Apple has planned for the iPhone 17?\"\nWith the anticipated launch of the iPhone 17 in September, it could be a good idea to hang tight and either buy the new phone or get the iPhone 16 at a discounted price. Apple still hasn't confirmed the existence of the iPhone 17, and we don't have any official specs or features, but here's how it could compare to the iPhone 16, according to rumors and speculation.\niPhone 16 vs. iPhone 17: Key rumored specs compared\nWe still don't have any confirmed details about the iPhone 17 but that hasn't stopped the rumor mill from churning and purported leaks from making the rounds. Speculation extends across the entire iPhone 17 lineup, from the Pro models to what could be a thinner \"Air\" version (which may be Apple's answer to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge). But I'm going to focus on the baseline iPhone 17.\nScreen differences\nOne of the most highly anticipated changes could be that the iPhone 17 adds a 120Hz display, which would be very welcome. Currently, only the iPhone Pro models have that higher refresh rate, while the baseline and Plus models are stuck with a 60Hz display. Bumping that refresh rate could also prompt Apple to bring the always-on display to the baseline model, making it easier to quickly glance at the time and your notifications without waking your display.\nThere's been some back-and-forth on whether the iPhone 17 will have a scratch-resistant, antireflective display. But the most recent reports suggest that feature will only be available on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, not the baseline iPhone 17 (or the Air). So there may not be major discrepancies between the iPhone 16 and 17 on that front.\nCamera differences\nIt's possible the iPhone 17's selfie camera will get a bump to 24 megapixels, instead of the current 12 megapixels found in the iPhone 16's front-facing shooter. Megapixels aren't the only determining factor for good-quality photos but if it is an upgrade, that could make taking selfies or shooting videos for social media on the front-facing camera less of a compromise.\nThere's also been some conversation about the camera bump on Apple's upcoming iPhone lineup. It's likely that only the Pro models' cameras will be nestled in a new, larger panel that stretches horizontally across the back of the phone (perhaps evoking the \"Geordi Visor\" on the Google Pixel 9) and that the baseline will maintain a similar camera arrangement to the iPhone 16. Only time will tell.\nDesign differences\nRumors suggest that like the iPhone 16, the iPhone 17 will have an aluminum frame. (In fact, it's possible that'll be the case for the entire lineup, apart from the iPhone 17 Air, which could have a titanium frame to make it lighter.)\nThere have also been reports that the iPhone 17 will use a new compact \"metalens\" technology for the proximity sensor, which could reduce the size of the Face ID sensor and the Dynamic Island. That could give slightly more real estate to the top of the 17's display.\nProcessor and RAM\nOne key element that could remain unchanged across both phones is the processor. The iPhone 17 is rumored to pack an A18 chip, just like the iPhone 16.\nWith Apple's plans to expand its Apple Intelligence suite of AI capabilities, it's possible the iPhone 17 lineup could come with 12GB of RAM instead of the current 8GB -- or at least part of it could.\nIn April, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the iPhone 17 Air and Pro models would sport 12GB of RAM but that Apple was still deciding whether to equip the baseline model with that higher amount too. In May, analyst Jeff Pu noted the baseline would remain at 8GB. We'll have to wait to see what Apple ultimately decides.\nSpeaking of Apple Intelligence, a new AI-powered Adaptive Power feature arriving with iOS 26 can help conserve the battery by making \"small performance adjustments,\" like \"allowing some activities to take a little longer,\" according to Apple. The next iPhone is expected to arrive with the upcoming operating system onboard but you'll also be able to download iOS 26 on the iPhone 16, as well as some older iPhones, once it becomes available publicly. That should help to stretch your battery life on either device.\nColor options\nWhat's on the inside may be most important but people also want to know what fun colors the iPhone 17 could sport. Rumors suggest the upcoming device could come in black, blue, silver, purple and green.\nFor comparison, the iPhone 16 is available in black, white, pink, teal and ultramarine.\nEverything we think we know about the iPhone 17 is still just speculation so we'll have to see what Apple unveils this fall.\nShould you buy an iPhone 16 now or wait for the iPhone 17?\nIf you're in desperate need of a new phone and can't wait any longer, who am I to stop you? But if you can hang tight until September, when Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 17, you can either score the flashy new device or get a discount on the iPhone 16. (In previous years, the company dropped the price on older models by about $100.)\nIt's likely the changes between the iPhone 16 and 17 will be relatively modest. Apple tends to debut newer features on its Pro models before eventually rolling them out across the full lineup, like it did with the Dynamic Island on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max and the Action button on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. So any shiny new capabilities will likely land on its more premium phones first, such as the rumored antireflective display and redesigned cameras on the iPhone 17 Pro models.\nBut perhaps the biggest changes could arrive next year with the 20th anniversary of the iPhone, for which Apple is reportedly \"preparing a major shake-up\" of the phone's design, according to Bloomberg. That includes a (long-rumored) foldable version and a \"bold new Pro model that makes more extensive use of glass.\" The iPhone 17 may not even be announced yet but it's never too early to be looking even further ahead."

      "text": "Key takeaways:\n- The iPhone 17 could feature a redesigned camera bump, though it may not be as drastic a difference as the Pro models.\n- A higher refresh rate could be coming to the full lineup, potentially enabling the baseline iPhone to have an always-on display.\n- Prices remain uncertain with tariffs, but they'll likely go up, given it's been years since Apple raised the price of the iPhone.\nThe anticipated reveal of Apple's newest iPhone is just around the corner. For months now, rumors have been swirling about what the upcoming device, likely called the iPhone 17, could look like, from a redesigned camera module to fresh colors and a higher refresh rate. The phone is expected to debut in early September, although Apple hasn't confirmed anything yet. You can also check out our rumors on the iPhone 17 Pro and the thinner iPhone 17 Air.\nPerhaps the biggest looming question is whether iPhones could get pricier, especially with tariffs. President Donald Trump has said Apple will have to pay a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the US. This would almost certainly lead to a price hike for consumers. We'll have to wait to see how Apple responds and if shoppers really do end up shouldering that extra cost. But even without tariffs, the iPhone may be due for a markup, as it's been years since Apple raised prices on its handsets.\nHere's everything analysts and leakers predict about the baseline iPhone 17.\nSee also: Thinking About Buying a New iPhone? Here's Why You Should Wait\nCamera bump redesign\nIt's not an iPhone release without a camera upgrade, and there have been plenty of rumors about what the camera module could look like on Apple's upcoming phones. In January, a leaked image from Majin Bu on X suggested the phone could feature a pill-shaped camera bar, essentially resembling what you'd find on Google's Pixel 9 phone. In February, Bu followed up with CAD renders of what's said to be the iPhone 17 lineup, featuring horizontal camera bars, as well as larger rectangular bars on the iPhone 17 Pro models.\nIn April, Bloomberg reported the \"iPhone 17 Pro will look a lot more like the 16 Pro than anticipated,\" adding, \"From the front, the 17 Pro will appear quite similar to the 16 Pro. It's the back camera that will look meaningfully different.\" The latest rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Pro's three-lens camera arrangement will be maintained but will sit on a new panel that stretches across the phone's width and is the same color as the rest of the phone.\nLater in April, Bu again posted an image of the purported iPhone 17 lineup, showing those wider camera bars with the stacked lenses still configured to the left.\nNot until next year, for the 20th anniversary of the iPhone, will Apple be \"preparing a major shake-up\" for the phone's design, Bloomberg says. That includes a (long-rumored) foldable version and a \"bold new Pro model that makes more extensive use of glass.\"\nAnother camera-related rumor is that the selfie camera on all iPhone 17 models will be upgraded to 24 megapixels, according to analyst Jeff Pu. That's a decent bump from the current 12-megapixel front-facing camera on the iPhone 16 lineup, although it's important to remember that more megapixels don't automatically mean better photos. Still, given how much people increasingly rely on their front cameras to snap selfies and record videos for TikTok and Instagram, this surely will be a welcome advancement.\niPhone 17 display upgrade\nRumor has it that all models of the iPhone 17 will feature a 120Hz display, bumping the non-Pro models up from their current 60Hz refresh rate. That could be a welcome change, as the discrepancy between the Pro and non-Pro refresh rate is surprising; when Apple debuted the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus with a 60Hz display, there was a bit of an outcry from folks who expected more in 2024. This rumored update could remedy that -- and possibly bring the always-on display to the baseline model.\nThere's been a lot of back-and-forth about whether the latest iPhones will have a scratch-resistant, anti-reflective display. A July report from MacRumors suggests that feature will in fact be arriving on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, just not the baseline iPhone 17 or the Air. This would make the Pro models the first iPhones with an anti-reflective screen, giving them a feature that CNET's Patrick Holland deemed one of the best attributes of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nThere also have been contradictory reports on whether the Dynamic Island on the iPhone 17 lineup will look any different. In May, Pu said all iPhone 17 models will use a new metalens technology for the proximity sensor, which could allow Apple to reduce the size of the Face ID sensor and the Dynamic Island, according to 9to5Mac. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, on the other hand, said in January that the Dynamic Island would remain \"largely unchanged\" in the iPhone 17 lineup compared to the iPhone 16. We'll have to see what ends up being true.\nRumors on what frames the iPhone 17 lineup will feature have gone back and forth. In February, Pu suggested the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all have aluminum frames. He noted that the iPhone 17 Air could be the outlier with a titanium frame.\nNew chipset\nIn May, Pu noted the iPhone 17 would have the same A18 chip used in the iPhone 16, while the iPhone 17 Air and Pro models will feature an A19 chip. It's possible the phones could also include the Apple-developed 5G modem, called the C1 chip, which debuted on the iPhone 16E.\nIn February, Kuo noted Apple will swap out Broadcom's Wi-Fi chips for in-house chips across the iPhone 17 lineup, stating this would \"enhance connectivity across Apple devices.\" It's not yet clear what exactly this would mean, but it would be interesting if Apple's C1 chip was also accompanied by its own Wi-Fi chip.\niPhone 17 battery\nSo far, rumors suggest only the pricer iPhone 17 Pro Max could get a bigger battery, according to Ice Universe. The leaker says the top-of-the-line phone could go from 8.25mm on the iPhone 16 Pro Max to 8.725mm on the iPhone 17 Pro Max as a result. In addition, leaker Instant Digital suggests the high-end phone could have about a 5,000 mAh battery, a notable increase over the 4,685 mAh on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, according to third-party tests.\nBut that doesn't mean the baseline version won't get any boost. Even if battery capacity stays the same (which it may not), the AI-powered Adaptive Power feature arriving with iOS 26 can help extend battery life. The feature automatically adjusts your iPhone's performance based on how you're using it at the moment, according to Apple. This could especially be helpful with the slimmer iPhone 17 Air, which will likely also have a thinner battery.\niOS 26 brings a fresh look\nApple has revamped its mobile operating system with iOS 26 (not iOS 19), which is named after the last two digits of the upcoming year. And with iPadOS, MacOS, WatchOS, TVOS and VisionOS following the same naming convention, the move is designed to bring more uniformity -- naming-wise and appearance-wise -- across the operating systems.\nThe new Liquid Glass interface brings a more transparent, lens-like look to the iPhone and other Apple devices. With iOS 26, the Camera app also adopts a more minimalistic design and Photos once again makes it easier to find your albums by adding separate tabs for your Library and Collections, instead of forcing you to scroll through a single cluttered screen. Updates to Messages include being able to add backgrounds to chat windows and create polls in group chats, and a new screening tool can better detect spam texts and move messages from unknown senders to a dedicated folder. You can read more about iOS 26 features here.\nIn April, tipster Digital Chat Station noted that given the use of Apple Intelligence and AI on a \"large scale,\" the iPhone 17 lineup will come with 12GB of RAM, instead of the current 8GB. Kuo noted the iPhone 17 Air and Pro models would sport that increased 12GB of RAM, but that Apple was still deciding whether to equip the baseline model with 8GB or 12GB of RAM. In May, Pu noted the baseline would remain at 8GB.\nPrice and release date\nWe expect the iPhone 17 to become available in September although it's not yet clear exactly when, as Apple hasn't confirmed anything.\nHistorically, Apple has unveiled its new iPhones on the first Tuesday of September after Labor Day. However, the first Tuesday in 2025 is the day after Labor Day so it's possible Apple could either push its iPhone event to Wednesday, Sept. 3, or hold it the following week on Tuesday, Sept. 9.\nThat would mean the phones could then become available on either Sept. 12 or 19. Preorders would kick off a week before general availability, on either Sept. 5 or 12.\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman has said that the new iPhone announcement should come Sept. 9 or 10.\nPrice is also a big unknown. Jefferies analyst Edison Lee has said the iPhone 17 Air, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max will get a $50 price increase to offset tariffs and the higher cost of components, but didn't mention the baseline iPhone 17. If that's true, the starting prices for the full lineup could be:\n- iPhone 17: $829\n- iPhone 17 Air: $979\n- iPhone 17 Pro: $1,049\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max: $1,249\nRegardless of higher component costs or tariffs, the iPhone is overdue for a price increase, because the last price hike was five years ago.\nThe latest rumors suggest the iPhone 17 could be available in black, blue, silver, purple and green.\nWe'll continue to update this piece as more rumors surface so be sure to follow along."

      "text": "Whatever your thoughts on the name, the iPhone's Dynamic Island has managed to win over fans (apparently even some Android users, too). The pill-shaped cutout and alert interface replaced the much-maligned iPhone notch that housed the True Depth camera system required for Face ID.\nUnlike the notch, which was a static physical cutout, the Dynamic Island is an area on top of the iPhone's display, which serves as an interactive hub and shape-shifts depending on the context. Within the Dynamic Island, two discreet cutouts remain for the camera and sensors, but the surrounding area is an interactive canvas of sorts for various content.\nApple's introduction of the Dynamic Island in 2022 for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max was greeted with a combination of excitement, curiosity and laughter. The feature, which surfaces up system alerts and shows live updates on apps running in the background, was overshadowed by its name.\nOn social media, people poked fun at the name Dynamic Island saying it sounded like an offbeat tourist destination. Apple enthusiasts worried that name didn't have the finesse that other Apple feature names, like AirDrop or FaceTime, had. Popular YouTuber MKBHD even offered a backhanded compliment in a post on Twitter that said it was \"the most Apple thing they've ever Appled.\"\nBy adding the Dynamic Island as a now-signature feature on the iPhone, Apple marked a departure from its rival Android phone makers. The latter opted to replace the screen notches on their devices with hole-punch cutouts for the selfie cameras. Through the Dynamic Island, Apple found a way to use the area around its cutout for system alerts, app controls, and tracking live activities, among other functions.\nWhen idle, the Dynamic Island is a fairly unobtrusive black area that takes up about an inch of screen real estate, which is smaller than the previous notch. Depending on what apps you're using, any background activities running and iPhone system alerts, the Dynamic Island will change into one of three shapes: a long oval, a large pop-up window and a combination of medium-sized oval and circle.\nWhen using a single app like Apple Music, it becomes a long oval and shows an album cover on one end and a waveform for the song being played. In this state, if you tap on the Dynamic Island, it'll open the Music app to the current song. If you press and hold on the Dynamic Island, it'll pop out into a larger window spanning the top of your iPhone with mini-playback controls. Likewise, if you receive a call the pill-shaped cutout lengthens to display caller information.\nIf you have two apps open at once, like the Music app and Apple Maps, the Dynamic Island will look like a lowercase letter \"i\" on its side. One of the apps, Maps, has its own medium-sized oval to show turn-by-turn directions. The second app, Music (in this case) is off to the right in its own circle -- displaying the album artwork.\nBecause it integrates with third-party apps, the Dynamic Island can also show a real-time estimate for your Uber's arrival as well as food delivery orders -- and when you press and hold on the Dynamic Island, it'll physically size up into a pop-up window to show that information.\nThe Dynamic Island also provides visual feedback for privacy indicators (such as when the microphone or camera is active), AirDrop file transfers, or Apple Pay transactions, among other system functions.\nHere are some of the things the Dynamic Island can show:\n- System alerts\n- Turn-by-turn navigation with Apple Maps or Google Maps\n- Contact information and call length for phone calls\n- Battery percentage when your iPhone or AirPods are charging\n- Find My Alerts\n- Screen recording duration\n- Cover art when playing songs from Apple Music\n- Transit card payments\n- Live sport scores\n- Flight information\n- Timer length\n- Payments with Face ID\n- Files sent with AirDrop\n- Mute icon\n- Live activities for services like Uber\nThe ability to dynamically change shape and display relevant content enhances the overall user experience. Since its launch, Apple has trickled down the feature to its base models which means the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus also feature the shape-morphing cutout in addition to the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. If you want to learn more about the Dynamic Island, read our iPhone 14 Pro review and our iPhone 15 reviews."

      "text": "We test dozens of phones each year, but we only consider a few to be truly great. The best phones in 2025 have a battery life that lasts a day or more, cameras that take stunning photos and vibrant displays, perfect for TikTok or watching The Gilded Age. 2025 has been an incredible year for smartphones. From Google's Pixel 9 series and Apple's iPhone 16 family to Samsung's Galaxy S25 series and foldable phones including the Motorola Razr Ultra and Galaxy Z Fold 7, these are the best phones you can buy. While tariffs and economic uncertainty have caused people to consider upgrading their phones sooner rather than later, companies like Apple, Samsung and Google have not raised their prices.\nOur Picks\nMOBILE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $449 (save $50)\n- $550 (save $50)\n- $300 (save $100)\nWhat is the best phone for most people?\nThe best phone for most people is the $799 iPhone 16. It comes in two sizes: a 6.1-inch regular iPhone 16 model or a larger 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus model that starts at $899. The phones have a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that performs better in low light and can now take macro photos, meaning you'll be able to focus close to take amazing food snaps. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have a handful of Apple Intelligence tools for writing, removing distractions from photos and doing summaries of messages and webpages. There's also adds a ChatGPT integration to Siri.\nThe phones also have an Action button that can be programed for different functions like turning on the flashlight, recording a voice memo, changing the focus mode and more. There's also a new Camera Control button that not only lets you take photos and quickly change things like zoom, Portrait mode aperture and Photographic Styles, but can also trigger a new feature called Visual Intelligence, which will add context to whatever the camera is pointed at, a bit like Google Lens. We think the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are ideal for most people looking for a great phone that will last for years.\nBest phones of 2025\nPros\n- Camera Control is useful for switching camera settings\n- Photographic Styles makes photos pop\n- Ultrawide camera is better in low light\nCons\n- Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t out yet\n- No always on display\n- No changes to wired charging speeds\n- No upgrades to the Action button\nWhen I tested the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus I was definitely impressed by the new photography features, the convenient Action button and the elegant build. I consider these phones to be top-notch choices for Apple fans. Parts of the iPhone 16\u2019s key feature, Apple Intelligence, are now out, and the fact that these phones will support it means they\u2019ll likely feel future-proofed for years to come. Aside from screen size (6.1 inches on the regular, 6.7 inches on the Plus), battery size and price, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are identical in every way.\nThe iPhone 16 isn\u2019t perfect -- it\u2019s missing an always-on display, and it feels like it\u2019s been ages since Apple improved its wired charging speeds. But it checks all the important boxes and then some.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus rank so high in our testing because the phones appeal to both novice users and power players a like. They offer about 90% of the experience of Apple's Pro models but cost hundreds of dollars less. Not only is the iPhone 16 a wonderful phone out of the box, Apple has a long track record of updating its software and security patches for years.\nWho it's best for\nWhen you think about how the Camera Control key, the Action button and the Dynamic Island come together, along with the camera and battery improvements Apple has made over the last several years, the iPhone 16 is a compelling upgrade for someone coming from an older iPhone, especially if that person is on an iPhone 13 or older. For those who don\u2019t need the Pro\u2019s extra photography prowess and battery life, the iPhone 16 won\u2019t disappoint.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nI wouldn't recommend buying the iPhone 16 just for the Camera Control button or the better ultrawide camera.\nPros\n- Camera consistently delivers good images\n- Impressive battery life\n- More AI features feel practical\nCons\n- Several gimmicky AI features\n- Not many changes over the S24\nThe Galaxy S25's biggest flex that I noticed while testing is it shares many of the same attributes as its pricier counterparts, the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra \u2013 but it does so for several hundred dollars less. You'll find features like the AI Select tool, Audio Eraser and deeper Gemini integration across all of Samsung's S25 devices, as well as a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12GB RAM \u2013 making the smaller phone of the bunch still seem pretty mighty.\nAnd while the Galaxy S25 might look incredibly similar to the S24 and share many of the same specs, consistency isn't so bad when it means there's a consistently good camera and great battery life. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 review.\nWhy we like it\nHaving a baseline phone, like the Galaxy S25, that delivers many of the same perks as more expensive models, is a huge plus in my book. And given the remarkable processing power, standout camera and seamless AI integration in the Galaxy S25 lineup, it's great that I can get all those premium features for $800.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're someone who insists on buying a flagship device, the Galaxy S25 won't let you down. but if you have a device that's two years old or more, you might be enticed to tap into all the latest Galaxy AI and integrated Gemini features. Now, $800 isn't pocket change, and there are definitely other options for those who want to be more budget conscious, but if you're willing to spend a bit more, the baseline S25 can be a great all-around choice.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nYou probably don't need to upgrade if you're using last year's S24.\nPros\n- Robust design\n- Bright high resolution inner screen\n- Battery life should last you a day or more\n- It's so damn fun to use\nCons\n- Cameras take decent photos but suffer from motion blur\n- Only three years of major OS updates\n- Gets warm playing games and using the camera frequently\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra is a beefed-up version of last year's Razr Plus, which won a CNET Editor's Choice Award. It's as if the Razr Plus hired a trainer and nutritionist and then got absolutely ripped -- warranting its name: Ultra. After testing, I've come to adore the Razr Ultra. It does all the \"normal\" non-folding phone things I want, and offers me a truly unique experience thanks to its cover screen. I feel like the coolest kid in the coffee shop when Google Pay-ing for my cortado with my Razr Ultra closed.\nBut in taking nearly every aspect of the phone to the extreme, Motorola lost one of the most important parts of recent Razrs: the amazing value. The catch for all this ultra-ness: the Motorola Razr Ultra costs $1,300.\nWhy we like it\nThis is the best built foldable flip phone I've ever used. Motorola took the best parts of the Razr Plus and improved nearly everything else. The battery life is outstanding and easily lasts a day on a single charge and can get you mostly through a second day even. The displays are brighter. The main 7-inch foldable display is larger and has more resolution than the Razr Plus and the cameras are improved. The fabric backing is delightful.\nWho's it best for\nSomeone who wants a fun, unique an robust foldable phone. You're willing to pay top-dollar to get the best processor, battery, design and cameras Motorola has ever made.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you're unsure of foldables, this might not be the best fit. If you find yourself in places with sand, dirt and other fine particles, the Razr Ultra (like all foldable phones) isn't worth the risk. The Razr Ultra has the same class-leading IP-rating for dust and water resistance, but the dust resistance is only for particles 1-mm or larger.\nPros\n- Larger screens/thinner bezels\n- 4K slo-mo OMG\n- Audio Mix is brilliant\n- iOS 18\nCons\n- No Apple Intelligence out of the box\n- Camera Control placement not optimal for one-handed shooting\n- Elegant finishes aren't very colorful\n- Only 128GB of storage for $1,000\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have everything I've come to expect in a year-over-year upgrade. The 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max have a slew of upgrades including one of the best batteries on any phone I've tested as well as. In our testing it will easily last a day on a single charge.\nThe phones also have larger displays, outstanding photo and video chops, high-resolution slo-mo, a new Camera Control button, iOS 18 goodies and a handful of Apple Intelligence tools. The negatives are as thin as the borders around the new screens: You only get 128GB of storage for $1,000; there are only drab color options, and a the new camera button is easy to tap accidentally. Read our full iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max review.\nWhy we like it\nThis year the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have the exact same cameras -- unlike the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, which had different telephoto options. Screen size, battery life and price should be the deciding factors when you're choosing between the two. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are excellent phones worthy of a spot in your pocket (and mine) if you can afford them.\nWho it's best for\nIf you have an iPhone 12 Pro or older, upgrading to the 16 Pro makes a lot of sense. If you're on a 13 Pro and still have a decent battery capacity, I'd say save your money. And if you're on a 14 Pro or 15 Pro, there's no need to upgrade. Also, I should note that the entry-level $999 iPhone 16 Pro only has 128GB of storage.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you are looking for a budget phone or don't need a phone with the latest features or tech.\nPros\n- Thin 4.2mm design\n- 200-megapixel main camera\n- Powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor\n- Durable build\nCons\n- Steep $2,000 price tag\n- Same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's Fold\n- 25-watt wired charging\nWith the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung has finally addressed some of the key issues with its previous book-style foldables. The impressively thin build and wider, 6.5-inch cover screen makes this feel like a standard phone when closed, and that wider 8-inch inside display is great for multitasking, with the ability to run up to three apps simultaneously. Perhaps most notably, the camera gets a major upgrade with the addition of a 200-megapixel main camera, which takes shots on par with the top-of-the-line S25 Ultra.\nAltogether, it\u2019s a great choice if you want a bigger, tablet-like display without the bulk or a compromise on camera quality.\nWhy we like it\nThe Z Fold 7 does a solid job combining what's great about standard slate phones and what's great about foldables. It feels wonderfully normal to hold when closed, thanks to its sleek design and lightweight build. It also packs great cameras and has an expansive main display that's 11 percent bigger than last year's Z Fold 6.\nThankfully, a slimmer build doesn't force the battery to take a hit; the Z Fold 7 maintains that same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's foldable. That pales in comparison to batteries from Chinese competitors, but at least it's not a downgrade. The Z Fold 7 also packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor to power the many AI features you'll get onboard, from Galaxy AI photo and audio editing tools to Google's Gemini Live and Circle to Search. The phone also supports seven years of software and security updates.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're bored of standard slate phones and want something that feels a little more exciting, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a great choice. The slim design and wider cover screen helps it to feel as normal as possible when closed, with the added perk of an expansive main display that's great for multitasking and watching videos. The cameras are also impressive for a foldable that's so thin.\nWho shouldn't get it\nThe Z Fold 7's $2,000 price tag is perhaps its biggest caveat. Also, if you don't need a bigger display, it may not be worth the splurge. Ironically, the cover screen is so practical that you\u2019ll rarely need to open the phone -- unless you\u2019re watching movies or multitasking, in which case a phone like the Galaxy S25 Ultra might be a better fit.\nPros\n- Best screen on any phone\n- Versatile cameras\n- Most powerful phone I've tested\n- Good battery life\nCons\n- $1,300 price\n- Design is almost too minimal\n- AI features are hit-or-miss\n- S25/S25 Plus have similar features and cost less\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra which has a lot of AI features, the best of which are interesting and the worst of which unreliable. Luckily, Samsung gets a lot of other things right on the S25 Ultra, which has a new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, high-resolution ultrawide camera, and some sweet pro video tools that rival the iPhone 16 Pro. Samsung wisely kept all the best parts of last year's Galaxy S24 Ultra (basically the entire phone including that antireflective display) but some of its worst parts, too, like the $1,300 price tag.\nIf you want the best screen you can find on any phone, get the S25 Ultra. If you want the most versatile phone cameras, get the S25 Ultra. If you want a stylus, get the S25 Ultra. But if your needs scale back on any of those fronts, the more affordable S25 options, or even last year's S24 Ultra, may be worth considering. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review.\nWhy we like it\nThe reason to get the Ultra over its S25 siblings is its screen, which is truly the best I've seen on any phone, and the cameras, which are a step above what the S25 and S25 Plus have. Added video features like ability to record in Log format gets the Ultra as close as it's ever been to the iPhone in terms of professional video capture.\nWho's it best for\nIf you have a Galaxy S22 Ultra or older, the S25 Ultra will seem like a significant upgrade. It's harder to make that case for S23 Ultra owners, who, unless their phone's battery is ailing or they can score an incredible discount, should otherwise sit this one out. And for you S24 Ultra owners, you don't need this phone. Save your money and treat yourself to a nice steak dinner and a movie.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra's appeal is muddied by its $1,300 price. The regular Galaxy S25 has the same functionality, power and longevity, and it costs $500 less. Want a bigger screen? Consider the Galaxy S25 Plus. For the majority of people, the regular Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will be a better fit.\nPros\n- The screen is delightfully bright\n- Cameras are good for $499\n- Gemini Live Video AI has potential to be useful\n- Solid build\n- The under-$500 price\nCons\n- Battery life is just OK, will get through a day\n- Processor is serviceable (curious about longevity)\n- Lacks emergency SOS satellite texting\nFor $499, Google's Pixel 9A truly feels like you're getting more bang for your buck. It comes with several significant upgrades from last year's Pixel 8A: a fresh design, new display, larger battery, slightly more powerful chip, increased durability and upgraded software features.\nBut don't get me wrong -- it's not a perfect phone. There are places where Google had to compromise to keep the price under $500, like the lack of satellite connectivity for emergencies available on the $799 Pixel 9. Overall, though, I think the compromises Google made were smart and that the Pixel 9A is worth every penny. Read our Google Pixel 9A review.\nWhy we like it\nThe Pixel 9A is proof that you don't need to spend more than $500 to get a great phone. It can handle all you daily tasks from scrolling social media and news feeds and swiping through TikTok videos to taking a beautiful photo and lasting a day on a single charge.\nWho's it best for?\nIn theory: anybody. The Pixel 9A is for anyone who wants 95% of what a $1,000 phone can do at half the price.\nWho shouldn't get it\nAnyone who wants the absolute fastest processor or the most cutting edge cameras.\nPros\n- USB-C port is more convenient charging\n- Colorful matte design\n- Improved camera that can automatically take people and pet portraits\n- Dynamic Island brings better multitasking\nCons\n- No always-on display\n- Find My Friends feature only works with other iPhone 15 phones\n- Discounted iPhone 14 Pro may be a better value\n- Galaxy S24 offers a longer optical zoom\nWith the launch of the iPhone 16, the regular iPhone 15 is being sold at a discount -- $100 off. That means that the iPhone 15 now starts at $699. And you might be able to find steeper discounts throughout the coming weeks and months. With the Dynamic Island, a USB-C port for more convenient charging and a high resolution camera and a sharper digital zoom, I found the iPhone 15 to be a significant upgrade for those with older iPhones.\nThe iPhone 15 is available in two size options: the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. They run on the same chip as iPhone 14 Pro, the A16 Bionic, which should bring notable performance upgrades to those with an iPhone that's several years old. These phones also have Apple's second-generation ultra wideband chip, enabling a new feature that makes it easier to find friends or family members in a crowd which I found handy. Read our full iPhone 15 review.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are heavily influenced by the iPhone 14 Pro. That includes the Dynamic Island, a dedicated area near the top of the screen for viewing time-sensitive data like your Uber's ETA, and the A16 Bionic processor. Overall, these changes come together to make the iPhone 15 feel like a big step forward for those upgrading from an aging iPhone.\nWho it's best for\nThe iPhone 15 is for someone coming from an iPhone 12 or older. In 2025, Apple sells it for $699. But I recommend looking for one that's discounted. If you're contemplating the iPhone 16E but really want an ultrawide camera (remember the 16E only has a single rear camera) and MagSafe charging, then grab an iPhone 15.\nWho shouldn't get it\nApple sells the $599 iPhone 16E which makes the iPhone 15 a curious value. If you can score a discounted iPhone 15 I'd go that way. But otherwise, the iPhone 16E might be a better buy.\nPros\n- Genuinely fun new AI skills\n- Sleek new design\n- Seven years of software updates\n- Cameras can take great daytime shots\nCons\n- Camera hardware hasn't improved much over Pixel 8 Pro\n- Gemini AI will eventually require a paid subscription\nThe Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL have a lot going for them, from their shiny new designs and long software support period. But it's the AI skills that really stand out, from the deep integration of the conversational Gemini Live, to the new Pixel Studio that creates weird and wonderful images from your text prompts.\nThe phones aren't perfect. While the cameras are good and can take excellent photos in bright light, they're just okay in low-light and in night mode. The best AI features will require a monthly subscription (though you get the first year for free) But if you're keen to experiment with AI on your phone then the new Pixel 9 Pro range is a superb way to experience it. Read our Google Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL review.\nWhy we like it\nGoogle's Pixel line of phones has gone from strength to strength and its latest model is unquestionably the best phone the company has ever made. It's not just the slick-looking design; the Pixel 9 Pro offers a superb camera system, a generous support period and a host of new AI skills making it one of the most accomplished Android phones around. The 9 Pro XL takes that further by accommodating a bright and vibrant 6.8-inch display.\nWho it's best for\nIt's a great phone for those of you looking for an elegant everyday Android phone. The interface is easy to navigate and the camera takes great photos with almost no effort on your part. If you feel overwhelmed by the plethora of settings and menus on other Android flagships, Google's Pixel 9 Pro is the way to go. If playing mobile games or watching videos on the go is a priority, opt for the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you don't need the best cameras Google makes, consider the regular Pixel 9. I do like the fit and finish better on the 9 Pro, but it starts at $999.\nPros\n- The 6.9-inch screen is immersive, with lovely colors and contrast\n- The 4.1-inch screen looks incredible\n- It's durable and survived a drop onto concrete\n- One UI 8 (Android 16) runs wonderfully\n- $1,100 is still a lot, but Samsung gives the phone more value than the Flip 6\nCons\n- Gets warm when recording videos and playing games\n- Battery life is the same as the Flip 6 despite a bigger battery\n- Cover screen software has room to grow\nWhen I first got my hands on Samsung's new Galaxy Z Flip 7, I was delighted to discover that it has a smaller crease, larger cover screen, thinner design and bigger battery compared to last year's Galaxy Z Flip 6. But as I tested the new clamshell phone, I became enthralled by its inner screen. At 6.9 inches, this is the biggest screen on any Samsung phone aside from the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which has an 8-inch foldable display.\nThe Z Flip 7's large screen size makes content feel more immersive and colors look lovely and vivid. This led to epic TikTok and Instagram sessions, watching widescreen films such as A Working Man and Back to the Future, as well as jumping back and forth between two apps stacked vertically on the screen thanks to One UI 8's 90:10 split tool.\nEvery time I open the Flip 7, I'm consistently dumbfounded by how such a large display can unfurl from something about the size of a makeup compact. And when it's closed, there's a 4.1-inch cover screen that's fantastic in its own ways, with new clever animations for when you're recording a video, charging the phone or taking a selfie, all efficiently using the extra display real estate. In terms of functionality, though, the cover screen's software is about the same as the 3.4-inch one on the Flip 6.\nThe Flip 7 impressed me in nearly every way but one: its battery life. It has a larger battery than the Flip 6, but it doesn't last any longer in daily use. It did consistently get me through a day on a single charge, often having 15 to 20% left, but there were also a few days where it needed an early evening top-off.\nWhy we like it\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 is the most fully realized version of Samsung's ideal of a flip phone since the launch of the original Galaxy Z Flip in 2020. The Flip 7's appeal is simple: It's a thin phone with a big, bold screen that folds in half into a coaster-sized square. The larger cover screen and inner screen make content more immersive. It's design is thin (for a clamshell foldable) and comfortable to hold. Plus you get twice the storage this year compared to last.\nWho is it best for\nIf you've been tempted by a clamshell-style foldable, you should definitely consider the Flip 7. If you have a Galaxy Z Flip 4 or older, the Flip 7 will be an upgrade in every way. It's harder to make that same recommendation for Flip 5 owners unless your phone is showing its age. And if you have a Galaxy Z Flip 6, you can sit this one out unless you really want those larger screens.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nIf you spend a ton of time around dirt or sand, this phone isn't for you.\nPros\n- Lightning fast charging\n- Nice big screen\n- 7 years of OS and security upgrades\n- Great performance with games, movies and animations\nCons\n- Battery life is a day, similar to baseline S25\n- Similar specs as the S25 at a higher price\n- Rival phones at the same price have better cameras\nIf the baseline Galaxy S25 appeals to you but you'd rather have a bigger screen and higher battery capacity \u2013 without upgrading all the way to the Ultra \u2013 the S25 Plus may be the phone for you. The entire S25 lineup shares many features, from AI capabilities to processing power to memory, so the Plus may be a viable choice if you're looking for something right in the middle.\nThat said, the Plus' minimal upgrades over the baseline S25 may not justify the $200 price difference. But if a bigger phone just feels better to hold and you'd rather have a 4,900 mAh battery (over the S25's 4,000mAh one), then that $1,000 starting price might ultimately be worth every penny. Read CNET's full Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus review.\nWhy we like it\nWhile the baseline S25 checks all the key boxes, the S25 Plus can simply feel like a more comfortable device to use, especially if you're a fellow member of the bigger hands club. In addition to sharing many of the same features as the pricier S25 Ultra, the S25 Plus has a higher battery capacity than the baseline model -- though in CNET's tests, there weren't any major discrepancies in how the two batteries actually performed. Still, sometimes you just want to live a little larger, and this phone can be the perfect fit.\nWho it's best for\nIf you like having a larger screen to watch movies or play games on, the S25 Plus can be a great choice. While the S25 Ultra might be a top pick for someone who wants both a bigger phone and the most premium features, the S25 Plus can be that goldilocks device that meets you right in the middle -- without you having to spend $1,300 on the Ultra.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nIf you want the absolute best in terms of cameras, don't get the S25 Plus. For $1,000 phones like the Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro have better cameras. Or if you can afford to buy a $1,300 phone, check out the Galaxy S25 Ultra which has an amazing set of lenses\nPros\n- Beautiful design that feels durable\n- Fun and somewhat useful AI features\n- New ultrawide camera takes good photos\n- 7 years of software updates for longevity\nCons\n- More expensive that previous Pixels and competitors\n- Doesn't feel that different from Pixel 8\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about the Pixel 9, from its respectable camera to its classy new design and lengthy 7-year timeline for software updates. But Google\u2019s phones have always shined for their clean, slick software, and that once again applies to the Pixel 9 series. Pixels are also among the first to get new software updates, making them an ideal choice for those who want to get their hands on the latest version of Android first. Aside from Android updates, Google also brings new features to Pixel phones throughout the year through updates it calls Feature Drops.\nThe Pixel 9 comes with a few new AI tricks that you may find useful, like the ability to search for content in screenshots, generate images from scratch in the Pixel Studio app and add new objects in photos. These features aren\u2019t must-haves, and they\u2019re not without flaws. Plus, at a starting price of $799, the Pixel 9 has a higher bar to live up to. But the Pixel 9 feels like it belongs in that class of device. Read our full review for the Google Pixel 9.\nWhy we like it\nThe Pixel 9 and Google's Gemini assistant still feel like a first step toward what the company is hoping to achieve: Making phone software more intelligent so that we can spend less time swiping, tapping, scrolling and digging. In the meantime, the Pixel 9 shines for its great camera, elegant design and clean software, just like the less AI-centric Pixels of years past.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're a Pixel fan upgrading from an older phone, like the Pixel 6 or earlier, you'll find a lot to love about the Pixel 9. But keep in mind that for the same price, Samsung's Galaxy S25 has a brighter screen and a dedicated telephoto lens for taking zoomed photos.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you want the absolute best cameras that Google makes, including having a dedicated telephoto lens, I'd recommend the Pixel 9 Pro.\nBest phones compared\n| Product | Apple iPhone 16 | Apple iPhone 16 Pro | Apple iPhone 15 | Google Pixel 9 | Google Pixel 9 Pro | Google Pixel 9 Pro XL | Samsung Galaxy S25 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | Moto G Power 5G (2024) | Motorola Razr Plus (2024) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556 x 1,179 pixel resolution; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,622 x 1,206 pixel resolution; 1-120Hz adapative refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556x1,179 pixels; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,424x1,080 pixels; 60-120 Hz variable refresh rate | 6.3-inch LTPO OLED; 2,856x1,280 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate | 6.8-inch LTPO OLED; 2,992x1,344 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate | 6.2-inch AMOLED; 2,340x1,080 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.7-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.8-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.7-inch LCD; 2,400 x 1,080 pixels, 60-120Hz refresh rate | 4-inch pOLED; 1,272 x 1,080 pixels; 1-165Hz variable refresh rate; 6.9-inch pOLED; 2,640 x 1,080 pixels, 1-165Hz variable refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 422 ppi | 495 ppi | 486 ppi | 416 ppi | 509 ppi | 501 ppi | 391 ppi | Cover: 417 ppi; Internal: 413 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 5.81 x 2.82 x 0.31 inches | 5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches | 2.82x5.81x0.31 inches | 6x2.8x0.3 inches | 6x2.8x0.3 inches | 6.4x3x0.3 inches | 5.78 x 2.78 x 0.28 in. | 6.24 x 2.98 x 0.29 in. | 6.41 x 3.06 x 0.32 in. | 6.6 x 3 x 0.3 in. | Open: 6.75 x 2.91 x 0.28 in Closed: 3.47 x 2.91 x 0.6 in |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm | 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm | 71.6x147.6x7.8 mm | 152.8x72x8.5 mm | 152.8x72x8.5 mm | 162.8x76.6x8.5 mm | 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm | 158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm | 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2 mm | 167.2 x 76.4 x 8.5mm | Open: 171.42 x 74 x 7.09mm Closed: 88.09 x 74 x 15.32mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 170 g (6 oz.) | 199 g (7.03 oz.) | 171g (6.02 oz.) | 198g (7 oz.) | 199g (7 oz.) | 221g (7.8 oz) | 162g (5.71 oz.) | 190g (6.70 oz.) | 218g (7.69 oz.) | 201g (7.09 oz.) | 189g (6.67 oz) |\n| Mobile software | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 17 | Android 14 | Android 14 | Android 14 | Android 15 | Android 15 | Android 15 | Android 14 | Android 14 |\n| Camera | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 48-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) 5x telephoto | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 48-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 48-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 200-megapixel (wide), 50-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto), 50-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 8-megapixel (ultrawide) | 50-megapixel (wide) 50-megapixel (2x telephoto) |\n| Front-facing camera | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 10.5-megapixel | 42-megapixel | 42-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 16-megapixel | 32-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K | 8K | 8K | 8K | 1,080p | 4K |\n| Processor | Apple A18 | Apple A18 Pro | Apple A16 Bionic | Google Tensor G4 | Google Tensor G4 | Google Tensor G4 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Mediatek Dimensity 7020 | Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 |\n| RAM + storage | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 16GB + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 16GB + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 8GB RAM + 128GB | 12GB + 256GB |\n| Expandable storage | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) | None | None | None | None | None | None | Up to 1TB | None |\n| Battery | Up to 22 hours video playback; up to 18 hours video playback (streamed). 20W wired charging.

The Fold 7 replaces last year's Fold 6 and comes with a completely new design that makes it thinner, lighter and feel more like a \"regular phone.\" The Flip 7 is the best-built foldable flip phone we tested from Samsung. The thinner design and bigger displays are the headline features.\nFactors to consider when buying a new phone\nPick the most important feature: Is it screen size? Camera quality? Battery life? This will help narrow down your choices. Phones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max or Galaxy S25 Ultra cost well over $1,000, for example, but pack large batteries that will last most people a day and a half to two days on a single charge.\nDon't dismiss $500 to $800 phones: You can get a great phone that does almost everything that a more expensive flagship model can do for a fraction of the price. Google's Pixel 9 (which starts at $799) packs a great camera, a bright screen and unique AI features, but the $499 Pixel 8A has most of the same key specs and comes at a lower price.\nShop Cyber Monday: Look for sales and deals close to holidays, especially Amazon's Prime Day and Cyber Monday.\nConsider last year's models: When a new phone gets launched, stores and carriers discount their older phones to sell off existing stock.\nSee the phone in person: It's worth going to a store and trying out a potential phone. You may love or hate the way it looks and feels.\nDecide on Android or iPhone: Do you have a lot of iPhone apps and Apple subscriptions? Stick with an iPhone. If you've invested in loads of Android apps, you may want to stay on that side of the fence. Otherwise, it's simple enough to switch platforms.\nBudget for a case and screen protector: Phones sold today are more durable than phones from even a few years ago, but it still might be a good idea to protect your phone with a case to keep it in tip-top shape.\nHow we test phones\nWe test every phone in real-world scenarios, focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new software updates, or to compare it against new phones from competitors such as Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus.\nPhotography\nPhotography is a major focus for most phones these days, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes, such as 4K slow motion video that debuted with the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, or the new Magic Editor photo tools that launched with the Google Pixel 9 series.\nBattery life\nBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long a phone lasts during a typical day of use and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test, as a simple, replicable measure of pure battery life, which isn't always included in the initial review but sometimes added later in an update.\nWe use benchmarking apps to measure each phone's performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Most noteworthy is how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations, and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo.\nWe perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of a particular phone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models.\nPerformance measuring\nRead more: How We Test Phones\nOther phones we tested\nWhile Apple doesn't sell the iPhone 15 Pro, you can still find it at carriers and third-party retailers. The 15 Pro has a 6.1-inch adaptive-refresh rate screen that adjusts between 1-120Hz depending on what's on the screen. It has excellent cameras, a fast processor, an always-on display, supports iOS 18 and safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite. Driving all these upgrades is Apple's A17 Pro chip which in use feels peppy. The iPhone 15 Pro is still an excellent phone in 2025. Check out our iPhone 15 Pro review.\nPhone FAQs\nWhat is the best time to buy a phone?\nHow long should a phone battery last?\nHow much storage should I get on a phone?\nWhat are the best phone brands currently?\nWhat to look forward to in 2025\nGoogle is expected to launch the Pixel 10 series in August. There's also buzz for the next iPhone, likely called the iPhone 17 -- from a slimmer version of the upcoming device to a new screen with a higher refresh rate on baseline models. We've rounded up rumors, leaks and analysis on the iPhone 17 Air (one of several nicknames for Apple's next iPhone). Read CNET's iPhone 17 rumor roundup for more info."

      "text": "Speculation continues to build that Apple's long-rumored foldable iPhone could debut next year. Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported Wednesday that the company plans to launch a foldable iPhone at the end of 2026 or early 2027.\nAccording to Kuo, the book-style device could be priced between $2,000 and $2,500. It's expected to feature a 7.8-inch crease-free inner display and a 5.5-inch outer display, which aligns with other rumors.\nDespite the steep price tag, Kuo believes Apple's dedicated fanbase will generate strong replacement demand, with projected shipments of 3 million to 5 million units initially and up to 20 million for the second generation.\nRead more: iPhone 'Flip': The Apple Foldable May Still Be Coming as Competition Grows\nThe report comes as Apple remains the only major smartphone manufacturer without a foldable device. The company has reportedly been working on one for years but has faced challenges with the phone's hinge and the durability of the display screen.\nCould foldables take off?\nFoldable phones still make up only a small segment of the market but are projected to experience significant growth in the next few years, especially if Apple enters the space.\nBloomberg reported in December that Apple is developing a large foldable iPad that could expand to the size of two iPad Pros. The largest current size iPad is 13 inches, but to make playing games and viewing shows and movies better, the screen on the rumored model would open wider and fold when not in use, making it easier to carry.\nAccording to market research firm IDC, total global sales of foldable phones reached 19.3 million units in 2024, up 6.3% from 2023 levels, Samsung led the way, followed closely by Huawei, Motorola and Honor. Foldables are typically priced high around $1200. Of course, the foldable numbers make for a stark contrast compared with the 1.4 billion total smartphones shipped in 2024.\nRamon Llamas, a research director at IDC, told CNET it's uncertain if an Apple foldable would find a sizable audience.\n\"A lot will depend on the use case and the price point,\" he said. \"But what would be interesting is that such a device would practically eliminate the need to own an iPhone and an iPad.\""

      "text": "At yesterday's Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple unveiled its next generation of software for iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, Apple Vision Pro, Apple Watch and Apple TV. The annual showcase for everything new from Apple introduced a whole bunch of new features and functions at the live event in Cupertino, California.\nApple's big presentation delivered a Liquid Glass redesign across operating systems and unified version numbers for the OSes (all ending in 26, e.g., iOS 26), except MacOS Tahoe 26, which still incorporates a tourist destination. Apple also introduced a new Gaming app -- which is mostly a hub but with some group features -- that we've been waiting for.\nApple prepped buzz for the event by releasing new retro merchandise for the nostalgic among us.\nThe event began with a buzz video of Craig Federighi, senior VP of software engineering, racing in an F1 car to promote the F1 movie produced by Apple for its Apple TV Plus streaming service.\nIf you're more the \"moment-by-moment\" type, you can check out our archived live blog. Or just skip to the memes inspired by the closing song. Or go straight to the part where you complain it bored you.\nPublic betas of the new operating systems will be available in July, and the first developer beta for iOS 26 is available right now.\nLiquid Glass redesign stole the show\nApple's \"gorgeous new design,\" for all its platforms is the first major overhaul since iOS 7. It's made possible by better displays and more powerful components.\nApple's vision for its next operating systems' interfaces is almost literally that: It's inspired by VisionOS. The new design system is called Liquid Glass, and brings a return to more pervasive translucency for the OS elements -- the same aesthetic that informs the software for its Vision Pro VR/AR headset.\nThat means more lens-like appearance, with specular highlights and dynamic movement as you change viewing angle. Navigation behavior changes as well.\niOS 26: The new operating system (and naming) is official\nLiquid Glass will probably make the most impact on Apple's most popular device. But in addition, there's a new unified layout for communications, integrating Phone and FaceTime.\nCall Screening will wait until someone begins to talk and tell you who it is before ringing through, while Hold Assist will keep the call connected in the background and ring you when someone answers. Across the apps, there are lots of interface elements floating and more features just a tap away.\nOn Monday, Apple introduced the Games app, its long-rumored \"new destination\" for gaming. There's a hug for Arcade, and it shows events and your entire game library in a single place. Play Together let's you managed co-op and group challenges. Developers can use the featued for turning single-player games into group challenges.\nAnd it works with a controller. Heck yeah.\nMessages gets a customizable background that's shared across a chat, group chats can host polls, and you can request or receive Apple Cash in group chats. You'll be able to filter messages out from recent and unknown senders out of notifications.\nEmoji generation gets smarter by letting you combine and modify Genmoji to more accurately reflect what you want to convey. New ChatGPT styles include techniques like oil painting, or the ability to ask for a specific style that's not a preset.\nLive Translation is now live in the communications apps with this version of the OS, and will work when you call someone who's not on an iPhone.\nIn addition to the new look, which includes things like dynamic scaling of widgets based on the photo on the lock screen, iOS can automatically make the photo 2.5D with animated artwork for what's playing. There's lyrics, live lyric transliteration, mixing via the new AutoMix feature and music pins in your library.\nThe camera adds a more streamlined process for accessing the basic photo and video modes, plus all the options have been made a quick gesture away. Library and Collections tabs are back in Photos. Apple opens Visual Intelligence to screenshot search, and you can also use it across apps or call up ChatGPT.\nMaps can learn your preferred routes and take them into account, give you travel time estimates and remember where you've been for a visited-location history.\nApple Wallet will offer passport info for digital IDs (for everything but flying). Pay will offer in-person redemption of Rewards and use of Installments.\niPadOS 26 gets more Mac-like every year\nWhile lower profile than iOS, iPadOS 26 got a lot more architectural changes aside from Liquid Glass and the Live Translation, communication and AI features from other devices.\nThe substantive changes for iPadOS include a new windowing system to improve multitasking. There's a grab handle to resize full-screen apps to windows, using the flick gesture to tile -- it works with a trackpad as well as touch. It looks very similar to MacOS.\nExpose brings up thumbnails of open windows so you can select the one you want. There's also a persistent menu bar at the top of the screen, like a desktop OS. Heck yeah. And it doesn't require a specific high-performing iPad; it works with Stage Manager and on multiple displays. Of course, some people are wondering (dreading?) what it will be like to use on an iPad Mini.\nFiles finally grows up, like a detailed list view with the ability to resize columns, the ability to drag a folder to the Dock and more.\nPreview comes to the iPad, and the OS adds support for selecting a mic and providing a noise-isolation option across apps. There are also more tools for creators, such as local capture via video conferencing apps, with mic options for better sound.\nBackground tasks -- yes! -- will show up as live activities, so you don't have to put it down and walk away for a render.\nMacOS Tahoe... 26\nThis year's location name is Tahoe, and the update includes the same communications appearance updates as iOS 26. MacOS Tahoe incorporates the Liquid Glass design, too. You can add a new set of controls to the control center, change colors or add emoji to folders.\nContinuity gets Live Activities, like on the iPhone, and the Phone app comes to the Mac with shared history and the other new AI features.\nShortcuts now have intelligent actions, like summarizing text or comparing things. Spotlight adds some of the annoying features of Windows search, like mixing results across types you don't want. Quick Keys are two-letter shortcuts for apps and actions, along with suggestions. It keeps a clipboard history, which should make a lot of folks happy.\nThe Games app on Tahoe has the same features as the app on iPhone, plus an in-game overlay. Updates to Apple's Metal graphics framework, Metal 4, add frame interpolation, denoising and more for potentially better game performance and quality. Upcoming games include Crimson Desert and Inzoi.\nWorkout Buddy makes its debut in WatchOS\nThe Apple Watch OS incorporates AI in a new Workout Buddy, which keeps your fitness history and offers vocal coaching (ugh, pep talks) with a summary of your workout stats at the end. Workout has a new layout and custom workouts.\nSmart Stack uses more data to prioritize and predict which features you'll want soon. It's smarter about notifications, basing the volume on the ambient noise in your environment, and adds a Wrist Flick gesture for things like dismissing notifications.\nThe new design also permeates Apple TV Plus and TVOS. Apple also announced some new upcoming originals and new seasons of existing shows like Slow Horses and Foundation.\nTVOS will let you jump back into shows more quickly and get into karaoke with your iPhone as the mic.\nVisionOS 26 adds more for business\nThis operating system already had the look, but Apple's taken VisionOS 26 deeper and more into-the-real-world. Widgets can be personalized and persistently overlaid. The OS will remember window placement. Photos can also create spatial views of photos and automatically convert images in articles, for instance. Personas will potentially look more accurate.\nCollaborative Pro usage got a co-op game callout, but it's for business. If you're using a shared team device, you can save your settings on your iPhone. There's also a new Eyes Only mode for privacy. Logitech Muse 3D stylus and PSVR hand controllers are two of the interesting new accessories for it.\nYou'll be able to edit Premiere Pro video and playback native 360-degree playback for popular action cams."

      "text": "Pros\n- Larger screens/thinner bezels\n- 4K slo-mo, OMG\n- Audio Mix is brilliant\n- iOS 18\nCons\n- No Apple Intelligence out of the box\n- Camera Control placement not optimal for one-handed shooting\n- Elegant finishes aren't very colorful\n- Only 128GB of storage for $999\nA few days into my week-long test of the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, it became obvious to me that the best feature on Apple's premium devices isn't the new camera control button, bigger screen or larger battery. It isn't even Apple Intelligence.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro's ability to record high-resolution slow-motion video is the best new iPhone feature I've seen in years. I used the 16 Pro to record footage of a lion dance rehearsal and was surprised by how the slow motion made the dancers' fast acrobatic movements look graceful, sustained and powerful -- something that's difficult to appreciate in real time. OK, I'm biased because I used to make short films and love the beauty of slo-mo.\nSee more: Apple iPhone 16 and 16 Plus Review: Little Improvements Add Up\nBut is the 16 Pro's 4K, 120-frames-per-second video capability really enough to get people who aren't camera nerds excited about Apple's new premium iPhones -- especially as the company touts the power of its Apple Intelligence suite of generative AI features?\nWith its straight-sided titanium build and Siri's rainbow glow, Apple hyped the iPhone 16 Pro as a vessel that will bring generative AI, in the form of Apple Intelligence, into our everyday lives.\nTurns out, the complete vision for the iPhone 16 Pro with Apple Intelligence that the company showed off at its September iPhone event just isn't ready yet. I appreciate that Apple is taking its time to wade into the gen-AI waters -- it can hopefully avoid the blunders associated with a rushed rollout that we saw with Google's AI Overviews release. But it's unfortunate that people who may have bought the iPhone 16 Pro or 16 Pro Max specifically for Apple Intelligence will have to wait before experiencing it on their new phone.\nAnd while I did get to test an early preview version of Apple Intelligence on the iPhone 16 Pro, key features were missing. I didn't get to test the ChatGPT integration, Genmoji or Image Playground.\nHowever, other standout features left me impressed with the 16 Pro. That high-resolution slow-mo recording function, various iOS 18 capabilities as well as hardware upgrades help the iPhone 16 Pro feel like a compelling upgrade.\nSee more: Best VPN for iPhone 2024\nBut should you buy it?\nIf you're buying the $999 iPhone 16 Pro (\u00a3999, AU$1,799) or the $1,199 iPhone 16 Pro Max (\u00a31,199, AU$2,149) for Apple Intelligence, don't. At least not yet. Apple has indicated that iOS 18.1, which will introduce the AI features, will come out in October.\nIf you have an iPhone 12 Pro or older, upgrading to the 16 Pro makes a lot of sense. If you're on a 13 Pro and still have a decent battery capacity, I'd say save your money. And if you're on a 14 Pro or 15 Pro, there's no need to upgrade. Also, I should note that the entry-level $999 iPhone 16 Pro only has 128GB of storage. For perspective, Motorola's $300 Moto G Power comes with 128GB. Apple's charging over three times the price, so it could have at least included 256GB of storage in the base model.\nThis year the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have the exact same cameras -- unlike the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, which had different telephoto options. Screen size, battery life and price should be the deciding factors when you're choosing between the two.\nShortcomings aside, the iPhone 16 Pro is impressive, and it will likely be even more so as software updates and promised features are added. Just don't buy it hoping for Apple Intelligence (yet).\niPhone 16 Pro's 4K 120fps slow motion\nThe year was 2020 and in the middle of the lockdown, Sony sent me the Xperia 5 II, which could record 4K, 120fps, slow-motion videos. The feature was the first time slow-motion video in 4K resolution had ever been offered on a phone. The Xperia 5 II was clearly ahead of its time and, until now, had been the high-water mark for phone-based slo-mo recording.\nApple takes all this to another level.\nNot only can the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max record 4K 120fps slow motion video, it can do so with little effort. Unlike the Xperia 5 II, which required using a professional camera app to record and preserve the footage, Apple bakes in the ability right into the iPhone's native camera app.\nAnd the results look outstanding, which is why this feature is such a big deal. Previous slow motion videos shot on the iPhone could look good if there was a lot of light. But they topped out at a lower HD resolution and the image quality was a significant step down from regular 4K 30fps video recording.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro's new slo-mo has great details, good dynamic range and accurate colors which puts it on par with regular iPhone video quality. Even when I was recording a lion dance rehearsal by the Lion Dance Me company in their San Francisco warehouse space, under medium lighting, the video looked good. You can see this slo-mo footage and more in the video below.\nApple Intelligence: Beta steps\nThe review unit Apple loaned me ran the iOS 18.1 developer beta, which allowed me to preview some Apple Intelligence features. It was a similar experience I had running the developer beta of 18.1 on my iPhone 15 Pro. And while Apple Intelligence is the headline feature for the phone, it's not quite fully baked. But from what I was able to test, I found Apple Intelligence to be useful and fun, and could see its potential.\nThe writing tools are clever. You can have it proofread something you wrote, or prompt it to rewrite it in a different tone and style, like concise, professional or friendly. The professional style is a bit stilted. It rewrote a text to a neighbor who was cat sitting for me, in which I joked about my cat being sad that I was gone. It conjured: \"My feline companion is experiencing distress due to my excessive work commitments, which have resulted in a neglect of his preferred activities, such as playtime and quality interactions.\"\nI found this hysterical.\nAs a professional writer, I don't expect I'd use these rewrite tools regularly. But one Apple Intelligence feature that I did use a ton was the Summarize tool, especially in Safari for news stories. I read a bunch of articles every day, so I can see the Summarize tool being the key to help weed out the clickbait from stories I should actually peruse.\nThe Create a Memory Movie in the Photos app is fun. I gave it the prompt \"San Francisco brunch,\" and it made a Memory Movie titled \"Brunching in the City\" complete with the song Cissy Strut by The Meters.\nBut probably the most notable feature has to be the Clean Up tool in Photos, which lets you remove unwanted elements from an image. In this photo of CNET's Lisa Eadicicco, I removed a chair on the left side and monitor on the right. I would have a hard time telling if there had been something there \u2013 aside from the leftover chair wheels.\nHere's one of CNET's Lexy Savvides and Celso Bulgatti.\nBelow is the same photo after I used the Clean Up tool to remove a person from the background who was talking to someone out of the frame. The results are good. But when I removed the van from the background, it was replaced with a Salavdor Dali-like bike wheel blob.\nSiri's glowing interface looks cool and the assistant seems faster and more helpful. When talking to Siri, I can be more natural and change what I say mid-thought. But this is far from the Gemini Live capability on Google's Pixel 9 phones, which has its own issues. Siri handles changing phone controls well, but when I asked what my phone's serial number was, it was unresponsive. The same was true when I asked how much storage I had on my phone.\nAgain, this was a preview version of Apple Intelligence, and the public release should arrive in October. While I take issue with Apple linking the iPhone 16 Pro and Apple Intelligence despite the gen-AI feature not being available, I do see where Apple is headed with generative AI and large language models, and I'm glad it's taking its time to get there.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro has more Camera Control\nApple added the Action button last year, and in 2024 gave us the Camera Control button -- which is so much more than just a button. Essentially, it's a shortcut key for the camera. Press it to open the camera and press it again to take a photo. Press and hold to record a video.\nThe button, located just below the power button, sits flush with the iPhone's side and can also be lightly double-tapped to bring up a gorgeous tiny menu of camera tools that gives me Q-Tip-in-the-ear levels of satisfaction every time I see it. If you select the zoom tool, you can slide your finger across the button to zoom in and out, almost like a miniature MacBook trackpad. You can also set it to adjust the \"aperture\" for Portrait mode photos to make the background look more or less blurry.\nMy favorite use is for swiping through Apple's new Photographic Styles to get a preview of different looks before I take a photo. Apple said that more functionality is in the works, including the ability to half-press the button to lock focus and exposure and full-press to take a photo -- like a dedicated professional mirrorless camera.\nThe biggest downside is if I'm holding the phone one-handed (I'm right-handed) to take a horizontal photo, I usually have my index finger across the side to help get a good grip on the phone, and that can accidentally interact with the Camera Control key.\nAs useful as the Camera Control button is, it seems ideally geared for Visual Intelligence, which can add context to whatever your iPhone's cameras are pointed at, a bit like Google Lens. Unfortunately, it won't arrive until later this year.\nThe Camera Control button will work with other photography apps, but I wish it could be used to swipe in apps like TikTok, or scroll through social media feeds and stories. It could be the elegant 2024 version of Blackberry's iconic scroll wheel.\niPhone 16 Pro cameras and photos\nIn essence, the regular iPhone 16 Pro has three new cameras. It inherits the 12-megapixel 5x telephoto camera from the Pro Max, replacing last year's 3x telephoto on the 15 Pro. It gets a new 48-megapixel ultrawide camera, and the main camera's 48-megapixel sensor gets upgraded to a faster one. And it's worth noting again that both the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have the same cameras.\nTake a look at some of my favorite photos from the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max.\nThe higher resolution ultrawide camera allows for truly great macro photos: super close-up ones like this one of a lion dance head mask -- look at the details in that fur!\nBut the ultrawide in macro mode can also grab good food snaps like this image of a Four Barrel cortado and scone.\nUltrawide photos look good and are closer in parity to the main camera in terms of image quality, but there's still quite a gulf between them. Check out this photo of a wine bar taken with the main camera.\nAnd here's an image of the same bar taken with the ultrawide.\nI like the contrast in the ultrawide photo, but it has less dynamic range than the main camera's image, which is also brighter. Lens flares are minimal; notice the street light (out of frame) bleeding in at the top of this photo and the small soft flare.\nMain camera images have a wide dynamic range like this shot of the SoMa neighborhood in San Francisco.\nPhotos from the main camera have great image quality. Skin tones look wonderful. Here's a group shot of some CNET-ers backlit by a San Francisco sunset. Everyone's complexion has a nice soft glow -- maybe a tad too soft, but it's far from looking plastic-y and processed.\nHere's a night mode photo of San Francisco's city hall taken on a foggy evening.\nApple overhauled its Photographic Styles, and this is one of the places where I enjoy using the camera control button the most, just swiping between styles to achieve the look I want. It reminds me to an extent of the film simulations on the Fujifilm X100VI -- not only in how these styles smartly change aspects of a photo, but for the fact that you can take control and customize each.\nWhen reviewing a photo or video in the Photos app, especially right after shooting it, you have to tap the display to see it full screen. It's not the end of the world. But when I'm filming a video and want to check a shot, it's just one more step - and sometimes in the heat of the moment, this adds friction that doesn't need to be there.\niPhone 16 Pro's Audio Mix is outstanding\nSpeaking of the Photos app, I'm impressed with the new Audio Mix feature for videos. iPhone 16 Pro videos straight out of camera already have a solid default noise-isolation feature. Audio Mix lets you adjust the audio you've recorded even more to isolate a person talking on camera, and make them sound like they're recording on a studio microphone. You can also place voices on a center audio track for film and preserve environmental sounds on a separate audio track.\nWatch the review video that's attached to this story to see Audio Mix in action. I recorded a video of CNET's Jessica Fierro singing and playing a guitar on a noisy rooftop. And we were blown away by how Audio Mix was able to remove city sounds, HVAC noise and wind.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is all about iOS 18 and A18 Pro\nOne of the best parts of the 16 Pro and Pro Max is iOS 18, which is all about personalizing your iPhone to fit your needs. Whether it's being able to move apps anywhere on the home screen, change icon colors and size or even remove app names, or add shortcuts to the Control Center, iOS wants you to customize your iPhone.\nThe flashlight controls in the Dynamic Island are fun and useful, and being able to use any emoji or live photos sticker as a tapback in Messages is such a delight. The QR code in the Passwords app for Wi-Fi is fantastic. For more on the new iPhone software, read CNET's iOS 18 review.\nPowering everything on the 16 Pro series is Apple's new A18 Pro chip. In use, the 16 Pro has been peppy, and able to handle big workloads from filming copious amounts of 4K slow-mo footage to playing video games and everyday scrolling.\nIn terms of battery, I've been primarily using the smaller 16 Pro, and it gets through a day fine. On my heaviest day of use (filming on it, having the screen at full brightness) the phone started at 6:30 a.m. with a full charge and dropped to 12% by 7 p.m. I topped it off for 15 minutes, which brought it back up to 37%, and it made it to 1 a.m. with 22% left. Check back on this review, as I will be updating it with results from CNET's battery tests.\niPhone 16 Pro wrap-up\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have everything we've come to expect in a year-over-year upgrade. Even without Apple Intelligence, the 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max have a slew of upgrades including a good battery life, outstanding photo and video chops and iOS 18. And the negatives are as thin as the borders around the larger screens: You only get 128GB of storage for a grand, plus drab color options and a new camera button that might get accidentally tapped.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are excellent phones worthy of a spot in your pocket -- if you can afford them.\nHow we test phones\nEvery phone tested by CNET's reviews team was actually used in the real world. We test a phone's features, play games and take photos. We examine the display to see if it's bright, sharp and vibrant. We analyze the design and build to see how it is to hold and whether it has an IP-rating for water resistance. We push the processor's performance to the extremes using standardized benchmark tools like GeekBench and 3DMark, along with our own anecdotal observations navigating the interface, recording high-resolution videos and playing graphically intense games at high refresh rates.\nAll the cameras are tested in a variety of conditions from bright sunlight to dark indoor scenes. We try out special features like night mode and portrait mode and compare our findings against similarly priced competing phones. We also check out the battery life by using it daily as well as running a series of battery drain tests.\nWe take into account additional features like support for 5G, satellite connectivity, fingerprint and face sensors, stylus support, fast charging speeds and foldable displays, among others that can be useful. We balance all of this against the price to give you the verdict on whether that phone, whatever price it is, actually represents good value. While these tests may not always be reflected in CNET's initial review, we conduct follow-up and long-term testing in most circumstances.\nApple's iPhone 16 and 16 Pro lineup\n| Apple iPhone 16 | Apple iPhone 16 Plus | Apple iPhone 16 Pro | Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, resolution, refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556x1,179 pixels; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.7-inch OLED; 2,796x1,290 pixels; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,622x1,206 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.9-inch OLED; 2,868x1,320 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 5.81 x 2.82 x 0.31 inches | 6.33 x 3.06 x 0.31 inches | 5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches | 6.42 x 3.06 x 0.32 inches |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm | 160.9 x 77.8 x 7.8mm | 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm | 163 x 77.6 x 8.25mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 170g (6 oz) | 199g (7.03 oz) | 199g (7.03 oz) | 227g (7.99 oz) |\n| Mobile software | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 18 |\n| Camera | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 48-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 12-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 48-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 12-megapixel (5x telephoto) |\n| Front-facing camera | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 4K up to 60fps; spatial video at 1080p at 30fps | 4K up to 60fps; spatial video at 1080p at 30fps | 4K up to 120fps; spatial video at 1080p at 30fps | 4K up to 120fps; spatial video at 1080p at 30fps |\n| Processor | Apple A18 | Apple A18 | Apple A18 Pro | Apple A18 Pro |\n| RAM/storage | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 256GB, 512GB, 1TB |\n| Expandable storage | No | No | No | No |\n| Battery | Up to 22 hours video playback; up to 18 hours video playback (streamed). 20W wired charging.

      "text": "If you're looking at your current iPhone and pondering whether to upgrade to a new model, now is a fraught time. Do you stick with it for another year? Or do the rumors include features you're itching to try? But most important is the question: When will iPhone 17 models be released?\nOnce the rumored iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, Pro and Pro Max are revealed, we'll be able to confirm speculation about colors, display, cameras and more. We'll also learn how much the new iPhone will cost, which is also still up in the air, thanks in part to looming tariffs.\nBased on previous releases, the new iPhone will be announced in September, but the exact dates for the announcement, preorder and release are still the subject of speculation.\nA representative for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nPossible iPhone announcement date\nOne recent leak points to Apple holding the iPhone 17 event on Sept. 9. German site iPhone-Ticker claims that it gained access to internal documents from a local carrier, and even though the sourcing cannot be confirmed, that release date lines up with existing rumors and expert opinion.\nWe've sifted through the whispers, analysis and guesses so you can make a date to get your hands on the new iPhone.\nRead more: Should You Buy an iPhone 16 or Wait for the iPhone 17?\nWhen will the iPhone 17 be released?\nFor nearly a decade, Apple has announced its new iPhone lineup in early September. The only exception was in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic when the release was pushed back to Oct. 23 for the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, and Nov. 13 for the iPhone 12 Mini and 12 Pro Max.\nIn his Power On newsletter on July 13, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said that the announcement should come on Sept. 9 or 10.\nThe supposed leak reported on by iPhone-Ticker lines up with expert opinion, so you might want to mark your calendar for Sept. 9 if you want to catch the new iPhone event.\nWe cannot verify these dates because we don't have access to the internal documents iPhone-Ticker is sourcing. But if these leaks are true, they suggest that preorders for the iPhone 17 will begin on Sept. 12, with a Sept. 19 release.\nHere's a chart for the release dates of previous iPhone models:\nPrevious iPhone release dates\n| iPhone series | Announcement | Preorder | Release |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| iPhone 16E | February 19, 2025 | February 21, 2025 | February 28, 2025 |\n| iPhone 16 series | September 9, 2024 | September 13, 2024 | September 20, 2024 |\n| iPhone 15 series | September 12, 2023 | September 15, 2023 | September 22, 2023 |\n| iPhone 14 series | September 7, 2022 | September 9, 2022 | September 16, 2022 |\n| iPhone 14 Plus | September 7, 2022 | September 9, 2022 | October 7, 2022 |\n| iPhone SE | March 8, 2022 | March 11, 2022 | March 18, 2022 |\n| iPhone 13 series | September 14, 2021 | September 17, 2021 | September 24, 2021 |\nHere's a chart for the potential dates based on past schedules. These are not official dates from Apple:\nPotential iPhone 17 schedule\n| Announcement | Preorder | Release |\n|---|---|---|\n| Wednesday, September 3 | Friday, September 5 | Friday, September 12 |\n| Tuesday, September 9 | Friday, September 12 | Friday, September 19 |\nWill all of the new iPhones be released in the fall?\nBased on last year's release, Apple may release everything in the fall except its least expensive option -- this year, the iPhone 16E. The iPhone 16E was released in February, and Apple is widely expected to follow the same format for the rumored iPhone 17.\nThat would mean the iPhone 17 Pro Max, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Air and the iPhone 17 base model -- if that's the lineup -- would be released in September. The iPhone 17E -- if it exists -- would be released in February.\nApple's future iPhone release dates\nApple is expected to change its release format with the rumored iPhone 18. Reports suggest that Apple will only release higher-end models in fall 2026 -- iPhone 18 Pro, Pro Max, Air and a rumored new foldable iPhone -- and release the rest of the line in winter 2027.\nWhy does Apple split iPhone release dates?\nBy pushing its top-of-the-line Pro and Pro Max models in September, Apple can capture much of the holiday shopping season. Releasing the more basic models in the winter allows a second crest of excitement, but diehard fans and holiday shoppers will have already spent their money on the pricier models in the fall."

Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today says that the size of the Dynamic Island across the iPhone 17 lineup will be \u201clargely unchanged\u201d compared to the iPhone 16 models.\nAnalyst Jeff Pu has reported several times that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature a \u201cmuch narrowed Dynamic Island\u201d thanks to a new \u201cmetalens\u201d technology.

      "text": "According to a recent investor note from GF Securities analyst Jeff Pu, Apple might have a pair of surprises in store for the iPhone 17 lineup this fall. Most notably, Pu has seemingly changed his prediction that the entire iPhone 17 lineup will use a version of the A19 chip. Instead, he now believes the base model iPhone 17 will use the same A18 chip that\u2019s used in the iPhone 16.\nPu had previously predicted that the entire iPhone 17 lineup would use the A19 chip and the differentiating factor would be the RAM. The analyst had said the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air would have 8GB, while the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max would have 12GB of RAM.\nNow, Pu claims that the iPhone 17 will use 8GB of RAM, while the iPhone 17 Air will feature 12GB of RAM just like the Pro models.\nAlso in this analyst note, Pu says that all four iPhone 17 models will adopt a new metalens technology for the proximity sensor. The \u201cmetalens\u201d technology may help Apple dramatically reduce the size of the Face ID sensor. Previously, Pu had said this change would only come to the iPhone 17 Pro Max. If it pans out, this means the entire iPhone 17 will feature a smaller Dynamic Island.\nNotably, this contradicts Ming-Chi Kuo, who reported in January that the Dynamic Island across the iPhone 17 lineup will be \u201clargely unchanged\u201d compared to the iPhone 16 models\nHere is Pu\u2019s full breakdown of the iPhone 17 lineup specifications:\n| Spec | iPhone 17 | iPhone 17 Air | iPhone 17 Pro | iPhone 17 Pro Max |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Launch | Sep-25 | Sep-25 | Sep-25 | Sep-25 |\n| Display | 6.1\u2033 | 6.6\u2033 | 6.3\u2033 | 6.9\u2033 |\n| Processor | A18 N3E | A19 N3P | A19 Pro, N3P | A19 Pro, N3P |\n| DRAM | LPDDR5 8GB | LPDDR5 12GB | LPDDR5X 12GB | LPDDR5X 12GB |\n| Front Camera | 24MP, 6P | 24MP, 6P | 24MP, 6P | 24MP, 6P |\n| Rear Camera | 48MP 7P, 12MP 5P | 48MP, 7P | 48MP 7P, Periscope 48MP 1G+3P, 48MP 6P | 48MP 7P, Periscope 48MP 1G+3P, 48MP 6P |\n| Face ID | Structured light | Structured light | Structured light | Structured light |\n| Casing | Aluminum | Titanium | Aluminum | Aluminum |\n| Modem | Qualcomm | Qualcomm or Apple | Qualcomm | Qualcomm |\n| Charging | 35W | 35W | 35W | 35W |\n| NPI | Foxconn | Foxconn | Foxconn | ICT |\nMy favorite iPhone accessories:\n- Anker Power Bank with built-in USB-C Cable\n- Charge your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods at the same time\n- Bring wireless CarPlay to any car\n- Anker MagSafe Power Bank\nFollow Chance: Threads, Bluesky, Instagram, and Mastodon.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "Key takeaways:\n- The iPhone 17 could feature a redesigned camera bump, though it may not be as drastic a difference as the Pro models.\n- A higher refresh rate could be coming to the full lineup, potentially enabling the baseline iPhone to have an always-on display.\n- Prices remain uncertain with tariffs, but they'll likely go up, given it's been years since Apple raised the price of the iPhone.\nThe anticipated reveal of Apple's newest iPhone is just around the corner. For months now, rumors have been swirling about what the upcoming device, likely called the iPhone 17, could look like, from a redesigned camera module to fresh colors and a higher refresh rate. The phone is expected to debut in early September, although Apple hasn't confirmed anything yet. You can also check out our rumors on the iPhone 17 Pro and the thinner iPhone 17 Air.\nPerhaps the biggest looming question is whether iPhones could get pricier, especially with tariffs. President Donald Trump has said Apple will have to pay a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the US. This would almost certainly lead to a price hike for consumers. We'll have to wait to see how Apple responds and if shoppers really do end up shouldering that extra cost. But even without tariffs, the iPhone may be due for a markup, as it's been years since Apple raised prices on its handsets.\nHere's everything analysts and leakers predict about the baseline iPhone 17.\nSee also: Thinking About Buying a New iPhone? Here's Why You Should Wait\nCamera bump redesign\nIt's not an iPhone release without a camera upgrade, and there have been plenty of rumors about what the camera module could look like on Apple's upcoming phones. In January, a leaked image from Majin Bu on X suggested the phone could feature a pill-shaped camera bar, essentially resembling what you'd find on Google's Pixel 9 phone. In February, Bu followed up with CAD renders of what's said to be the iPhone 17 lineup, featuring horizontal camera bars, as well as larger rectangular bars on the iPhone 17 Pro models.\nIn April, Bloomberg reported the \"iPhone 17 Pro will look a lot more like the 16 Pro than anticipated,\" adding, \"From the front, the 17 Pro will appear quite similar to the 16 Pro. It's the back camera that will look meaningfully different.\" The latest rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Pro's three-lens camera arrangement will be maintained but will sit on a new panel that stretches across the phone's width and is the same color as the rest of the phone.\nLater in April, Bu again posted an image of the purported iPhone 17 lineup, showing those wider camera bars with the stacked lenses still configured to the left.\nNot until next year, for the 20th anniversary of the iPhone, will Apple be \"preparing a major shake-up\" for the phone's design, Bloomberg says. That includes a (long-rumored) foldable version and a \"bold new Pro model that makes more extensive use of glass.\"\nAnother camera-related rumor is that the selfie camera on all iPhone 17 models will be upgraded to 24 megapixels, according to analyst Jeff Pu. That's a decent bump from the current 12-megapixel front-facing camera on the iPhone 16 lineup, although it's important to remember that more megapixels don't automatically mean better photos. Still, given how much people increasingly rely on their front cameras to snap selfies and record videos for TikTok and Instagram, this surely will be a welcome advancement.\niPhone 17 display upgrade\nRumor has it that all models of the iPhone 17 will feature a 120Hz display, bumping the non-Pro models up from their current 60Hz refresh rate. That could be a welcome change, as the discrepancy between the Pro and non-Pro refresh rate is surprising; when Apple debuted the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus with a 60Hz display, there was a bit of an outcry from folks who expected more in 2024. This rumored update could remedy that -- and possibly bring the always-on display to the baseline model.\nThere's been a lot of back-and-forth about whether the latest iPhones will have a scratch-resistant, anti-reflective display. A July report from MacRumors suggests that feature will in fact be arriving on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, just not the baseline iPhone 17 or the Air. This would make the Pro models the first iPhones with an anti-reflective screen, giving them a feature that CNET's Patrick Holland deemed one of the best attributes of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nThere also have been contradictory reports on whether the Dynamic Island on the iPhone 17 lineup will look any different. In May, Pu said all iPhone 17 models will use a new metalens technology for the proximity sensor, which could allow Apple to reduce the size of the Face ID sensor and the Dynamic Island, according to 9to5Mac. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, on the other hand, said in January that the Dynamic Island would remain \"largely unchanged\" in the iPhone 17 lineup compared to the iPhone 16. We'll have to see what ends up being true.\nRumors on what frames the iPhone 17 lineup will feature have gone back and forth. In February, Pu suggested the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all have aluminum frames. He noted that the iPhone 17 Air could be the outlier with a titanium frame.\nNew chipset\nIn May, Pu noted the iPhone 17 would have the same A18 chip used in the iPhone 16, while the iPhone 17 Air and Pro models will feature an A19 chip. It's possible the phones could also include the Apple-developed 5G modem, called the C1 chip, which debuted on the iPhone 16E.\nIn February, Kuo noted Apple will swap out Broadcom's Wi-Fi chips for in-house chips across the iPhone 17 lineup, stating this would \"enhance connectivity across Apple devices.\" It's not yet clear what exactly this would mean, but it would be interesting if Apple's C1 chip was also accompanied by its own Wi-Fi chip.\niPhone 17 battery\nSo far, rumors suggest only the pricer iPhone 17 Pro Max could get a bigger battery, according to Ice Universe. The leaker says the top-of-the-line phone could go from 8.25mm on the iPhone 16 Pro Max to 8.725mm on the iPhone 17 Pro Max as a result. In addition, leaker Instant Digital suggests the high-end phone could have about a 5,000 mAh battery, a notable increase over the 4,685 mAh on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, according to third-party tests.\nBut that doesn't mean the baseline version won't get any boost. Even if battery capacity stays the same (which it may not), the AI-powered Adaptive Power feature arriving with iOS 26 can help extend battery life. The feature automatically adjusts your iPhone's performance based on how you're using it at the moment, according to Apple. This could especially be helpful with the slimmer iPhone 17 Air, which will likely also have a thinner battery.\niOS 26 brings a fresh look\nApple has revamped its mobile operating system with iOS 26 (not iOS 19), which is named after the last two digits of the upcoming year. And with iPadOS, MacOS, WatchOS, TVOS and VisionOS following the same naming convention, the move is designed to bring more uniformity -- naming-wise and appearance-wise -- across the operating systems.\nThe new Liquid Glass interface brings a more transparent, lens-like look to the iPhone and other Apple devices. With iOS 26, the Camera app also adopts a more minimalistic design and Photos once again makes it easier to find your albums by adding separate tabs for your Library and Collections, instead of forcing you to scroll through a single cluttered screen. Updates to Messages include being able to add backgrounds to chat windows and create polls in group chats, and a new screening tool can better detect spam texts and move messages from unknown senders to a dedicated folder. You can read more about iOS 26 features here.\nIn April, tipster Digital Chat Station noted that given the use of Apple Intelligence and AI on a \"large scale,\" the iPhone 17 lineup will come with 12GB of RAM, instead of the current 8GB. Kuo noted the iPhone 17 Air and Pro models would sport that increased 12GB of RAM, but that Apple was still deciding whether to equip the baseline model with 8GB or 12GB of RAM. In May, Pu noted the baseline would remain at 8GB.\nPrice and release date\nWe expect the iPhone 17 to become available in September although it's not yet clear exactly when, as Apple hasn't confirmed anything.\nHistorically, Apple has unveiled its new iPhones on the first Tuesday of September after Labor Day. However, the first Tuesday in 2025 is the day after Labor Day so it's possible Apple could either push its iPhone event to Wednesday, Sept. 3, or hold it the following week on Tuesday, Sept. 9.\nThat would mean the phones could then become available on either Sept. 12 or 19. Preorders would kick off a week before general availability, on either Sept. 5 or 12.\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman has said that the new iPhone announcement should come Sept. 9 or 10.\nPrice is also a big unknown. Jefferies analyst Edison Lee has said the iPhone 17 Air, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max will get a $50 price increase to offset tariffs and the higher cost of components, but didn't mention the baseline iPhone 17. If that's true, the starting prices for the full lineup could be:\n- iPhone 17: $829\n- iPhone 17 Air: $979\n- iPhone 17 Pro: $1,049\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max: $1,249\nRegardless of higher component costs or tariffs, the iPhone is overdue for a price increase, because the last price hike was five years ago.\nThe latest rumors suggest the iPhone 17 could be available in black, blue, silver, purple and green.\nWe'll continue to update this piece as more rumors surface so be sure to follow along."

      "text": "We're half a decade into foldable phones, with plenty of devices from Samsung, Google and Motorola (as well as others from Oppo, Huawei and more) for consumers to choose between. Yet among big phone makers, only Apple still lacks one in its lineup. The latest flexible-screen devices, like the Galaxy Z Fold 6, the Motorola Razr Plus reboot and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold show mature designs and robust bending displays, leaving the foldables niche handily dominated by Android devices. Recurring leaks and rumors suggest Apple is still developing its own folding device, which we'll refer to it as the iPhone Flip until a proper name is revealed.\nThe iPhone 16 series launched in September 2024 with an AI camera button and AI features in iOS 18 that are still rolling out, and the more affordable iPhone 16E launched with Apple's first in-house modem. Still, we've yet to see any official word on a foldable iPhone. Apple's recent focus has been on Apple Intelligence, a suite of generative AI tools now in the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, which is also coming to updates for Apple devices in other product families. Apple might be slowly tinkering away at a folding iPhone while software and AI have taken center stage during its product showcases.\nSome rumors have even suggested that Apple is working on foldable displays for its other portable devices, the iPad and MacBook, though the company may have encountered obstacles. In a post on X back in September, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said challenges with folding displays have pushed back mass production of either model to 2027 or even 2028. Since other rumors have suggested the iPhone Flip could come out as early as 2026, we could see an iPhone that folds before an iPad or a MacBook with a flexible display.\nIt's unclear if or when Apple will switch focus from AI to bring an iPhone Flip to market, though the most recent rumors suggest progress continues. A report back in July, as covered by The Verge and first reported by The Information, suggests Apple has gone all-in on a clamshell-style foldable iPhone and moved it beyond the concept stage to give it a code name, supposedly internally referring to the device as \"the V68.\" If all goes well, the iPhone Flip could get a release date as early as 2026, the report said.\nThe newest rumor reaffirms the possible 2026 release window for the iPhone Flip, with noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo posting on X production may kick off next year. Market rumors suggest Apple has placed orders for 15-20 million iPhones to be sold in 2026 and the following years, Kuo continued, though with many components like the hinge not yet being finalized and assembly supplier Foxconn not officially starting the project yet (they're expected to begin in the third or fourth quarter of this year), this timeline could shift.\nThis follows Kuo's report in early March that Apple's device could launch at the end of next year and will have a 7.8-inch crease-free inner display and 5.5-inch outer display -- which would make it a book-style foldable like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 6 rather than a clamshell foldable, as other rumors have suggested Apple was focusing on.\nAccordingly, Kuo believes the price would match other similar folding devices at $2,000 to $2,500. Despite that high price tag, he says projected shipments are 3 to 5 million devices initially, which is a confident estimate given only 19.3 foldables were sold in 2024, market research firm IDC reported.\nThis reaffirms previous rumors and news. A new patent granted to Apple last July, which was applied for years ago, shows how long the company has been working on a folding iPhone, although many reports have focused on the company's struggles to eliminate the crease within the internal folding display. Creases have haunted foldable phones since they started coming out in 2020, and although the most recent Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 have reduced the crease, you can still see and feel it.\nPrevious rumors suggested Apple had been working on iPhone Flip models in two different sizes, though there have been difficulties in making the devices to Apple's demanding standards. The company may also be working on a folding tablet with a screen around the size of an iPad Mini.\nThen again, we may not see an iPhone Flip for years. By mid-2024, market analysts at TrendForce estimated that issues with the display crease might push back an Apple foldable until 2027, according to 9to5Mac. Prior rumors said Apple may not launch its own flexible screen device until 2025, and Samsung hasn't let phone fans forget it by releasing an app that will let Apple phone owners experience a Z Fold-esque experience by placing two iPhones side-by-side. At the very least, an investor note seen in August suggests Apple's foldable may not reach its 2025 schedule for mass production due to display issues, according to MacRumors.\nYears ago in 2017, folks predicted that a foldable iPhone could launch in the then-near future of 2020 -- which didn't happen. Analysts and leakers have been kicking the release date down the road ever since, and rumors and wish lists have hung around as phone fans keep their hopes up. Absent any confirmed details from Apple, here's everything we know so far about the company's future foray into foldables.\nRead more: I Visited Samsung's Home Turf to See if Foldable Phones Are Really the Future\nWhat Apple's new patent says about the iPhone Flip\nAfter years of rumors that Apple was working on foldable phones, a patent was finally granted to the company that confirmed it's been working toward a folding iPhone. The 22-page patent (PDF), simply titled \"Electronic Devices With Durable Folding Displays,\" was filed in November 2021 and granted on July 16, 2024.\nSadly for folding iPhone hopefuls, the patent doesn't offer much illumination of what an iPhone Flip might look like. Most of the pages show figures depicting cross-sections of potential displays that fold about a hinge, but not the device they're folding around.\nThere are some tidbits deeper into the text of the patent that hint at potential design choices Apple might make, like a hinge that holds the display flat when unfolded but which would let the display \"slightly fold about the bend axis when the electronic device is jolted during the drop event\" -- in other words, if dropped, the device would fold inward slightly so that it lands on its edges to protect the inner display.\nIt's important to note that all evidence shows Apple working on a foldable iPhone, but the patent broadly applies to folding displays in general -- to wit, some figure schematics describe a device that \"may be a cellular telephone, tablet computer, laptop computer, wrist-watch device or other wearable device, a television, a stand-alone computer display or other monitor\" or screens as far-ranging as on vehicles, in kiosks, in media players or other electronic equipment.\nThe rest of the patent describes what an Apple device with a folding display may have, and categorically lists things like batteries and wireless charging, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, LED or LCD displays, microphones and capacitive sensors, haptics and so on. There's explicit mention of a display folding 180 degrees, or fully flat, which follows most other foldables -- presumably, Apple isn't going to leapfrog the competition in following Samsung's concept displays we saw at CES that unfold nearly 360 degrees.\nTwo foldable iPhone Flips?\nFoldable iPhone hopefuls will at least be encouraged that Apple seemingly continues to tinker with an iPhone Flip design. The company is said to be working on two sizes of folding iPhones: a book-style and a clamshell-style, according to an older report by The Information, although this may be countermanded by a newer report by the same site suggesting Apple had settled on the latter for a smaller device. This aligns with prior rumors hinting the iPhone Flip will be in the clamshell format like the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip series or Motorola Razr Plus.\nIt sounds like Apple's been struggling to meet its high expectations: The company's design team wants the iPhone Flip to be half as thin as current iPhone models and to have displays on the outside that are visible when the device is folded shut, according to the report.\nDevelopment on the iPhone Flip was halted around 2020, the older report noted, in order to focus on a new project, a folding iPad. This device would have an 8-inch display to be around the size of the iPad Mini. The foldable tablet supposedly had less strict durability and thickness requirements, as it wouldn't need to fit in pockets like an iPhone Flip. Apple was still working on ways to reduce the crease in the middle of the folding display and get the iPad to lie fully flat.\nRelease date: The iPhone Flip launch could be in 2025... or 2027\nThe latest indications of an iPhone Flip release date came in June, when analyst Kuo suggested production could kick off in 2026 with phones coming out that year. This follows Kuo's earlier prediction in March that the company could release a crease-free foldable by the end of 2026. Furthermore, this would likely be a book-style foldable with a 7.8-inch internal display and 5.5-inch external screen, which is counter to other predictions anticipating a clamshell-style foldable.\nIt's possible that these timeline predictions apply to one or the other, or due to the vague nature of rumors, even both -- that is, Apple could be working on both a book-style and clamshell style foldable, though it's less clear if release date expectations would be interchangeable or if Apple would stagger their release.\nIt's been an open secret for years that Apple is working toward a foldable iPhone. The company has been registering patents for foldable technologies for almost a decade, and while there's no guarantee that one will come out even after all that research (remember AirPower?), there's still been buzz and possible release dates floated for years -- though still not one solid enough to get excited about.\nEarly rumors pointed as far back as 2021 as a potential target date, but the year passed with no foldable iPhone in sight. A March 2021 report from longtime Kuo (via MacRumors) suggested 2023 might be more realistic (though that year has come and gone). According to Kuo, Apple still needs to figure out technology and mass production issues before bringing a device like this to market, hence the wait. Speculation later in 2021 from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman aligned with Kuo's predictions: In his Power On Newsletter, Gurman said that the foldable iPhone may not arrive for another two to three years.\nSince then, new rumors have pointed to an even later release. Reliable display analyst Ross Young said in February 2024 that the foldable iPhone had been pushed back to 2025, and Kuo reaffirmed his predicted release window in a tweet in April 2022.\n\"Apple may launch its first foldable product in 2025 at the earliest, which may be a foldable iPad or a hybrid of iPad and iPhone,\" Kuo wrote in the tweet.\nAnother rumor, first noticed by MacRumors in February of 2024 by Weibo-based blogger Fixed Focus Digital, suggested that the foldable iPhone project is delayed for the foreseeable future. The problem? Apple, which is rumored to be using Samsung folding panels for its iPhone Flip's display, was dissatisfied with the screens' performance after they broke down a few days into testing.\nThat's echoed by the most recent estimate by TrendForce market analysts, reported in 9to5Mac, which predicted that an Apple foldable might not be released until 2027 at the earliest. Why? Apple's strict requirements for reliability and the phone display's crease. But Kuo's more recent March 2025 predictions explicitly noted a crease-free foldable display, suggesting Apple might have moved past this roadblock -- if all these rumors are to be believed, of course.\nRead more: Top Foldable Phones for 2024\nDesign: What will the foldable iPhone look like?\nA 2021 report from Bloomberg indicated Apple already had a working prototype of a foldable iPhone display. While it wasn't a working model, it was a step up from a patent -- which, until then, was all we had seen.\nApple seems to have taken out every patent under the sun when it comes to foldable displays, including an origami-style folding display, a flip-up display and even a wraparound display. We don't know which one will make the final cut, but both Kuo and Bloomberg seem to agree that the current prototype is more of a traditional fold-out design.\nUnlike Microsoft's Surface Duo, which has hinges on the exterior, Apple's would have one continuous display with a hidden hinge mechanism like the Galaxy Fold.\nApple leaker Jon Prosser reported in early 2021 that the iPhone Flip will likely use a clamshell design and come in several \"fun colors.\" Between the bright pastels of the iPhone 15 and Plus and the sleeker deep blue of the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, an array of fun colors for Apple's first foldable device is definitely a possibility.\nYouTuber ConceptsiPhone also gave us a glimpse into what the iPhone Flip could look with concept art of the foldable iPhone in the colors blue, red, gold and green.\nIn March 2025, analyst Kuo had some very specific but non-clamshell predictions: that Apple would release a book-style foldable with a 5.5-inch outer screen that unfolded to have a 7.8-inch internal screen, and be 4.5-4.8mm when unfolded but 9-9.5mm thick. It would have the same high-density battery cells as the \"ultra-thin iPhone 17\" and a hinge with stainless steel and titanium alloy (a favorite material of Apple's iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max as well as the Apple Watch Ultra 2).\nPer Kuo's predictions, the foldable will have two rear cameras and a front-facing camera on both the external and internal displays. Most interestingly, Kuo also expects that Apple's book-style foldable will see the return of Touch ID as a side button, as Face ID might be left out due to space constraints -- presumably for the array of depth-of-field sensors and cameras needed for the tech.\nRoadblocks: What still stands in Apple's way?\nSamsung and others have been testing the waters, but Apple has been learning from the pain points of their foldable devices and figuring out how they'd be used.\nOne of these pain points is the crease. A lot of the current cover materials, including the glass and plastic mix that Samsung uses for the Z Fold and Z Flip, show a visible crease when folded out to full screen. To avoid it, Apple would likely have to wait for Corning, Apple's glass provider, to create some kind of bendable version of its Ceramic Shield screen. The company is already working on a bendable glass but hasn't announced a launch date for it.\nKuo tweeted in April 2022 that Apple was testing a foldable OLED screen. Korean tech news site The Elec also reported that Apple was working with LG to develop a foldable OLED panel.\nCost: Foldable phones don't come cheap\nPrice is another major problem for these types of devices. Although Samsung still has the most affordable folding phone with the clamshell Z Flip 5 at $999, most others in the category are book-style foldables like the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and the Pixel Fold, which are around twice the price of most flagship phones. We wouldn't expect a foldable iPhone to be cheaper than its rivals. Apple's foldable needs to be in line with current foldable and nonfoldable models to be able to compete against other brands and entice iPhone users to ditch their single-screen devices and pay more for a foldable.\nA report last year found that half of American consumers are interested in buying a foldable phone, though Apple customers are slightly less willing to make the leap than Samsung or LG users. Perhaps the \"Apple effect\" will change those stats if and when a foldable iPhone ever becomes a reality.\nFor more, check out all of the models in the iPhone 15 line.

      "text": "The rumored iPhone 17 color lineup includes a shocking twist for the iPhone 17 Pro models.\nLast week, a Korean blogger named yeux1122 published two images of camera covers that could be the full lineup from iPhone 17 base model and the rumored iPhone 17 Air, and leaker Majin Bu posted that the rumored Sky Blue color would be scrapped for the Pro models. And now, another leaker has posted this week the possible color lineup for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. We'll get to the surprise in that photo below.\nWe've already heard plenty of rumors that the iPhone 17 base model could come in purple, green and blue. Two to three other familiar colors are now said to be included in the options -- totaling five (or maybe six) possibilities for the base model. The rumored iPhone 17 Air could come in four, while the Pro and Pro Max are expected to have five.\nThe rumored iPhone 17 is likely to drop in September. As the month draws closer, we're hearing plenty of rumors and leaks, but we're still playing the guessing game. Here's what we're hearing about possible iPhone 17 colors.\nThe rumored full color lineup\nHere's the full lineup for the rumored iPhone 17 base and Air models, according to Sonny Dickson, a consumer tech reviewer, who shared an image on X on Monday:\nThe iPhone 17 base model could come in these colors:\n- Black\n- Gray\n- Silver\n- Light blue\n- Light green\n- Light purple\nThe iPhone 17 Air could be released in these colors:\n- Black\n- Blue gray\n- Light gold\n- Silver\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max could come in these colors:\n- Black\n- Gray\n- Silver\n- Dark blue\n- Orange\nYeux1122 has a similar lineup in their post, but the base options don't include gray.\nBlack and silver aren't surprising since we've seen both neutral colors in earlier iPhone models and generations. However, if you use a colored phone cover instead, like I do, this possibility could be welcome.\nThe iPhone color I didn't see coming\nPurple, blue and green are all part of the same color palette. The neutral colors don't quite surprise me since they're standard for iPhones at this point. But the color orange is shocking. Dickson expects that the color will only be for the Pro and Pro Max models.\nDickson also noted the orange shade may end up being a dark gold or copper.\nSky blue could be old to Apple, but a new iPhone hue\nThe early rumored color for the iPhone 17 was sky blue.\nWell-known leaker Majin Bu posted the rumor of the new color on their blog, calling it \"a refined, bright, and modern shade.\" But why sky blue?\nPerhaps because the latest M4 MacBook Air currently comes in sky blue, an iPhone in the same color could be an aesthetic win for sky blue MacBook owners.\nBu initially wrote that the sky blue color could be for the iPhone 17 Pro, but recently scrapped that rumor to say sky blue would be for the iPhone 17 Air.\nIt seems like there's a possibility for different shades of blue, as we see in the lineup above. Rumor has it that there could be a blue option for the iPhone 17 base model and a dark blue for the iPhone 17 Pro. But based on Bu's post, there's a possibility of the iPhone 17 Air getting a sky blue hue. We'll have to wait and see which -- if any -- blues will be available for iPhone 17.\nThe possibility of purple\nBu posted on X and their blog on June 20 that Apple is testing purple and green, but that purple could be another new color for the iPhone 17's base models.\nBu said that purple could meet Apple's rumored demand for more personalization while blending into Apple's ecosystem for its other products.\nIf green is added to the iPhone 17 lineup, Bu says it could be a \"fresh and natural tone, ideal for a minimalist yet striking aesthetic.\" Yeux1122 and Dickinson included both purple and green in their rumored lineups this month.\nCould an aluminum iPhone design bring more colors?\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max have a titanium frame, but analyst Jeff Pu predicted that the iPhone 17 could usher in the return of the aluminum frame for both the Pro and baseline models, as we've seen with earlier versions like the iPhone 14 lineup. Considering the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max's colors are based on titanium, it raises the question: Will an aluminum frame mean new colors?\nThe one phone in the iPhone 17 lineup that could have a titanium frame is the rumored slimmer iPhone 17 Air, according to Pu. We'll have to wait and see what Apple decides.\nRead more: WWDC Bored Me. I Need Apple's iPhone 17 Launch to Make a Splash\nA look at past iPhone colors\nApple likes to release both new and familiar colors for every new iPhone release.\nUsually, we see more color variations for the basic models, and more neutral colors for the Pro and Pro Max iPhone models. For instance:\nThe iPhone 14 came in six colors: midnight, starlight, red, blue, purple and yellow. However, the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models only came in black, silver gold and deep purple. The same is true for the 15 model phones, but Apple offered one fewer color for its base model.\niPhone 15 models were available in pink, yellow, green, blue and black, while Pro and Pro Max models arrived in more neutral tones like white, blue, black and natural titanium.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max colors didn't change from the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. However, the other iPhone 16 models were available in ultramarine, teal, pink, white and black.\nHow many new colors we may see from the rumored iPhone 17 is still unclear, but as of now, a sky blue option could well be in your future."

      "text": "Tech companies are known for, shall we say, \"borrowing\" features from each other. Any time Apple or Samsung release a new phone or software update, you can be sure arguments over who did it first, or better, will ensue among hardcore fans.\nSo, as Apple reportedly plans to debut a thinner version of the iPhone 17 this fall, it might look to competitors to see what resonates with consumers. And a few features on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge are on my wishlist for the rumored iPhone 17 Air. Reports suggest the skinnier iPhone could ultimately replace the iPhone Plus, and would have a similar $900 price tag. But whether or not tariffs will affect that price isn't clear.\nSamsung's super-thin S25 Edge clocks in at 5.8mm and 163 grams. It costs $1,100 and is available for purchase now. It's also one of my favorite phones I've ever used, thanks to the fresh form factor. In fact, despite my initial skepticism, I'm now convinced thin and light phones are the way to go. You can check out my review for a more in-depth breakdown of my experience using the phone.\nFor now, though, I want to share five Galaxy S25 Edge features I'd love to see on the iPhone 17 Air. Apple may not have confirmed the existence of this slim device just yet, but that can't stop a girl from dreaming.\nA titanium frame\nDespite the Galaxy S25 Edge's spacious 6.7-inch display, it still feels impressively feather-light. In spite of its thinness, it's also surprisingly sturdy, it doesn't feel like it's going to snap in my hand or pocket.\nThat lightweight durability is thanks to the phone's titanium frame, which is something I hope Apple adopts for its thin iPhone, too. Apple uses titanium frames in its Pro model phones, so it'd be great to see that same treatment applied to a thin iPhone. Since I'm sure it'll also have a premium price, it will definitely need extra reinforcement to keep it from bending.\nRumors have gone back and forth on whether Apple's upcoming iPhones will have aluminum or titanium frames. However, analyst Jeff Pu said in February that the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max will all have aluminum frames, and that the iPhone 17 Air could be the outlier with a titanium frame. I really hope that's true.\nA 120Hz refresh rate\nSamsung's S25 Edge has a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling. Honestly, with that $1,100 price, I'd be pretty annoyed if it didn't. If the iPhone Air is going to be marketed as a premium device, then it also needs to have a premium display. Simple as that.\nAsking for a 120Hz refresh rate in 2025 doesn't sound like an extravagant request -- until you remember that Apple's baseline 16 and 16 Plus iPhones only have a 60Hz refresh rate, which is truly mind boggling. Hopefully, Apple remedies that with the entire iPhone 17 lineup, and especially with the iPhone 17 Air.\nMore than one camera, please\nNumber three on my wish list is the iPhone 17 Air's cameras -- and notice I said \"cameras\" with an \"S,\" because I don't want just one.\nOne of the compromises with thinner phones is that the camera hardware can get scaled back. The Galaxy S25 Edge has two rear cameras, which is less than the rest of the S25 lineup. But Samsung has, impressively, carried over the 200-megapixel main camera that you'll also find on the S25 Ultra, and pairs it with a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera. This makes for some pretty great shots -- images are sharp, colors are balanced and portraits really pop.\nSome rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air could follow in the footsteps of the iPhone 16E and have just one rear lens. But that would be a huge bummer, since the 16E is technically a \"budget\" phone -- even if that $600 price tag suggests otherwise.\nAlthough the iPhone 16E has a 48-megapixel camera with 2x magnification, I'd still feel cheated if that's all I got with a more premium device like the iPhone 17 Air. If I'm going to spend around $1,000 on a phone, I want the cameras to live up to the price tag.\nBeat Samsung on battery life\nAnother feature you'll have to compromise with when opting for a slim phone is battery life. Less room means a smaller battery, which means shorter battery life. The S25 Edge has a 3,900 mAh battery, which is the smallest capacity across the S25 series. It's lasted me all day, even with my excessive screen time, but not much more than that.\nI challenge Apple to break past that limitation and give us a skinny phone that doesn't skimp on battery. It could be a great way to set the iPhone 17 Air apart from competitors -- and in turn can push those competitors to improve their offerings, too. Apple's Adaptive Power feature on iOS 26, which uses AI to subtly scale back energy usage, could be the secret to that longer battery life.\nGenerous storage and RAM\nI was pleasantly surprised that the Galaxy S25 Edge packs 12GB of RAM, with 256GB and 512GB storage options. Since expandable storage is such a rarity -- and is practically out of the question with a thin phone -- it's great to not worry too much about filling up your phone's memory with photos, videos and games. All of that RAM helps to power the S25 Edge's many AI features it shares with the rest of the S25 lineup.\nThe entire iPhone 16 lineup has 8GB of RAM, which seems to be working just fine, even when powering Apple Intelligence features. So maybe asking for 12GB of RAM on the iPhone 17 Air is unnecessary. But what I really hope is that a skinny iPhone won't scale back on memory, and will also include a 512GB storage option. That way, you can really enjoy having a thin phone, without curtailing your use of it.\nWe'll see what Apple's got up its sleeve, and whether it really will launch a cutting-edge competitor to Samsung's S25 Edge."

      "text": "Apple clearly had more in mind when it added the first new physical button to the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro since the Action Button appeared on the iPhone 15 Pro. The Camera Control, which lies flush on the right side of the phone, is a physical button as well as a touch-sensitive capacitive control surface that responds to pressure and also detects finger movement like a tiny, narrow trackpad.\nFor photography, it adds a whole new way to take photos and switch capture settings on the fly. But it's also key to Visual Intelligence, a feature of Apple Intelligence that uses the camera to recognize things around you and act on them. iOS 18.3 adds two new Visual Intelligence capabilities -- quick identification of plants and animals, plus the ability to create a calendar item by pointing at an event listing (which you can do even without an iPhone that runs Apple Intelligence).\nUsing a physical button to trigger the camera shutter isn't a new concept. You can snap a photo by pressing the volume control button in the Camera app. So if the new Camera Control were simply another button -- even if better positioned when holding the phone in its wide orientation -- it would have felt like a letdown. Instead, it's a feature exclusive to the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nRead more: Best camera control cases for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro\nHow the Camera Control button works\nThe iPhone's Camera Control is a physical button that depresses when you push it, but it's also accentuated with haptic feedback like the MacBook trackpads (which feel indistinguishable from a physical mechanism even though the trackpad is just a solid piece of glass).\nThe surface of the button is a smooth capacitive surface that responds to the motion of your fingertip. (The MacBook Pro Touch Bar technology lives on!)\nWhen you lightly press the button -- exerting some pressure on the surface but not enough to depress the switch -- an onscreen overlay appears. Did you notice how iOS 18 introduced a subtle user interface animation that shows a black indent where a physical button press occurs? The Camera Control button extends that area to an overlay where the Camera Control options reside.\nOpen the Camera app with the Camera Control button\nOne of the new standout iOS 18 features is the ability to remove the default Camera icon from the lock screen and replace it with something else. I've personally never used this shortcut, preferring to swipe from the right edge to open the app.\nNow, pressing the Camera Control button quickly launches the built-in Camera app, which is arguably faster because it's positioned near where your thumb or finger rests while holding the iPhone.\nIf you find yourself accidentally launching the app when you don't mean to, you can require a double-press: Go to Settings > Camera > Camera Control and under Launch Camera select Double Click.\nCapture a photo or video the 'traditional' way\nCamera ergonomics are often overlooked, but they can mean the difference between composing a shot comfortably and twisting your fingers into pretzels to tap the shutter button onscreen.\nTo take a picture, press down on the Camera Control button. To start recording video, press and hold the button. (Hopefully, a future update will add a setting that lets you change the hold behavior, allowing it to capture bursts of images instead of video. You can already do that by pressing the Volume Up button, but only after enabling the option under Settings > Camera > Use Volume Up for Burst.)\nA light press also temporarily hides most of the interface items for a clutter-free look at your subject. If you don't mind seeing that information, go to Settings > Camera > Camera Control and turn off Clean Preview.\nIn iOS 18.3 you can lock auto exposure and auto focus (AE/AF) with a light press and hold of the button, the way you can with a half-press of the shutter button on most cameras. Otherwise you can still touch and hold on the screen where you want to focus and the app will lock focus and exposure at that point, even if you recompose the shot.\nIf you find yourself locking exposure and focus accidentally, this can also be turned off. Go to Settings > Camera > Camera Control and turn off Lock Focus and Exposure.\nZoom and switch between the cameras\nPerhaps the biggest advantage of the Camera Control is having so many functions available without having to move your fingers all over the screen.\nTo zoom in and out, you lightly press to bring up a slider and drag to adjust the focal length.\nA light double-press of the Camera Control button brings up a sliding overlay of other camera options.\nThe Cameras option -- represented by an icon that looks like a shutter -- allows you to switch between cameras and their focal lengths, such as selecting the Ultra Wide camera (0.5x zoom) or the Telephoto camera (5x zoom).\nQuickly adjust exposure and depth\nAlso included in the overlay that appears when you lightly double-press the Camera Control button are options for Exposure Compensation and Depth. The latter is the iPhone's way of changing the aperture (it even uses a \u0192 icon to indicate f-stops), but because all iPhone cameras include fixed physical apertures (the opening through which light passes through the lens to the image sensor), the control adjusts the simulated depth in Portrait mode; if the camera detects a subject in the scene, it automatically saves depth information.\nChoose Photographic Styles\nApple has revamped its Photographic Styles feature on the new iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models, replacing the stock filters and making the styles more editable. They're also selectable via the Camera Control. (The iPhone 13, 14 and 15 models still use the Photographic Styles feature introduced in 2021, which operates differently.)\nDouble-press lightly on the control to view the capture overlay and drag to select the Photographic Styles option. Then slide your finger to preview the styles in real time and choose one.\nCamera Control works for capturing video, too\nThese Camera Control options also apply when shooting video. In Apple's video from its September 2024 event, a demo suggested that switching between resolutions and frame rates, such as 4K 120 FPS, will be possible using the control, but that feature doesn't yet appear. Currently you can zoom, choose cameras and adjust exposure.\nApple also demonstrated how it can be applied in third-party photo and video apps by highlighting the Grid Composer feature in Lux Software's Kino video app, which cycles among types of visible guides.\nWhat about non-photo features of the Camera Control?\nThe button is reserved for photographic uses, including features that third-party developers include in their photo and video capture apps. If you don't want to take pictures using the control, you can also use it like a second Action button to scan QR codes or launch the Magnifier Control Center tool. Go to Settings > Camera > Camera Control and choose Code Scanner or Magnifier in the list of apps.\nBut the Camera Control is also the gateway for a new Apple Intelligence feature called Visual Intelligence that uses the camera.\nWith the iPhone locked, press and hold the Camera Control button to bring up Visual Intelligence, which activates the camera. When you snap a picture in this mode, Apple Intelligence looks up what you're pointing at. You can then do a visual search of whatever is in front of the camera or tap an Ask button to send the query to ChatGPT. In Apple's examples, a person snapped a shot of a restaurant to get more information and check its operating hours and then looked up the breed of a passing dog.\nIn iOS 18.3, you don't even need to snap the picture for some features. When you point the camera at a plant or animal, Visual Intelligence attempts to identify the subject on screen with a badge at the top of the screen. Tapping it brings up more detail.\nIn the same fashion, pointing Visual Intelligence at printed event details, such as \"Concert on Feb. 20, 7:30 p.m.\" will create a calendar event with those details, saving a lot of typing on your part.\nCamera Control is exclusive to the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro.

      "text": "Until it launches in September, Apple won\u2019t officially acknowledge the existence of its long-rumored iPhone 17 Air, but the second beta of iOS 26 is already giving us some clues. Hidden in the system code, we found references to a new display resolution that doesn\u2019t match any current or previous iPhone model, but it matches the leaked resolution of the rumored ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air.\nAs seen by Macworld, the second iOS 26 developer beta, which was released on Monday, includes a new version of the iconic clownfish wallpaper with a resolution of \u201c420\u00d7912@3x,\u201d or 1260\u00d72736 pixels. There\u2019s no iPhone model with such a resolution, at least not yet.\nBut here\u2019s where things get more interesting. The new resolution wallpaper we found matches a report by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo last year, which claimed that the iPhone 17 Air would have a screen of around 6.6 inches with a resolution of approximately 1260\u00d72740.\nIn other words, the wallpaper all but confirms the existence of a new iPhone model with that exact display resolution. Given that iOS 26 will almost certainly be released in September along with the new iPhones, it\u2019s clear that Apple is already making the final adjustments for the next-generation iPhone.\nSince other iOS 26 wallpapers don\u2019t have that resolution, most likely, the wallpaper was forgotten by Apple within the build released today for developers and shouldn\u2019t be seen by the public.\nAccording to rumors, the iPhone 17 Air will be just 5.5 millimeters thick, making it the thinnest iPhone ever released. It should weigh around 145 grams, much less than current iPhones. We\u2019re hoping to get our first hands-on with the new phone at an event in September 2025, but iOS 26 may have just given us our first concrete clue that the iPhone 17 Air is real and coming soon."

      "text": "The iPhone 17 series will get a $50 price increase, according to a Jefferies analyst Edison Lee. Since what President Donald Trump touted as \"Liberation Day,\" the possible effect of tariffs on the iPhone's price has been widely discussed. And yet, despite tariffs and politics, iPhone prices have remained the same so far this year.\nLee expects that to change this fall. He says that the iPhone 17 Air (17 Slim), 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max will get a $50 price increase to offset the higher costs of components and tariffs, as reported by Business Insider. He didn't mention the regular iPhone 17 getting a price hike. If true, that would mean that the starting prices for the iPhone 17 series will be:\n- iPhone 17 - $829\n- iPhone 17 Air - $979\n- iPhone 17 Pro - $1,049\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max - $1,249\nNews on the price hikes follows a May report by The Wall Street Journal that Apple is considering a price increase and could attribute the rise to new and updated features instead of tariffs. But the launch of the rumored iPhone 17 this fall will likely come with a higher price, no matter what Trump says or does.\nApple is the third-largest company in the US, and most of its products are manufactured in China. Clearly, the iPhone's ubiquity has made it a symbol for the ongoing uncertainty of the US economy and politics. But even without higher component costs or tariffs, the iPhone has been overdue for a price increase. The last price hike was five years ago.\nHistorically, five years is the longest stretch of time Apple has gone without an increase since the five years between the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 7, which ended with the iPhone 8 launching at a higher cost. We can learn a lot by looking at how the company has handled earlier price hikes (and a one-time drop) and what that means for the iPhone 17.\nTo figure out how likely we are for a price hike, I grouped iPhone models into a few categories: the standard, the flagships and the behemoths. The standard includes models like the original iPhone, the iPhone 8, the iPhone XR and the iPhone 16. The flagships include variants like the iPhone X, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro. And the behemoth's designation is for phones like the iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone XS Max and iPhone 16 Pro Max. There are other versions that Apple sold, like the iPhone 5C, the SE series, the iPhone Mini line and the current iPhone Plus line, that don't factor into this analysis. Also, I use the US starting price for each iPhone before any carrier discounts are applied. Let's dive in.\nStandard iPhone prices\nSince its debut in 2007, the standard iPhone has had four price increases and one correction. Many folks might remember paying $199 for the original iPhone, but in reality, the phone cost $499 off-contract. In 2008, Apple raised the price $100 with the launch of the iPhone 3G to $599, where it would stay for four years. Then, in 2012, the iPhone 5 was introduced with a taller, 4-inch screen and a higher $649 price tag.\nFast-forward to 2017, the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and the iPhone 8 debuted at a cost of $699, a $50 increase. Every year between 2017 and 2019, the price for the standard iPhone changed. In 2018, the iPhone XR launched at $749. The following year, the iPhone 11 came out, and the price dropped back to $699. And what makes that drop interesting is that the iPhone 11 was the first standard Apple phone with two rear cameras: a wide-angle and ultrawide. Up till then, all other standard iPhone models had only a single rear camera. From 2007 to 2019, when Apple increased prices, it was in $50 increments, except between the first and second iPhone models.\nThen 2020 happened. It was a wild year for the iPhone and everyone because of the pandemic. But Apple managed to launch the iPhone 12, which cost $829, marking the largest increase for the standard iPhone: $130. Subsequent models all had the same price: The iPhone 13, 14, 15 and 16 all cost $829.\nIf Apple follows its previous pattern, then the standard iPhone is due for a price increase. The last raise was in 2020, five years ago, and Apple has never gone six years without a price hike on the standard model. But will the company slowly raise the price over a few years like it did between the iPhone 7, 8 and XR? Or will it go all in like it did with the iPhone 12?\nThe standard iPhone is Apple's most popular, and it's safe to expect that the iPhone 17 will cost more (and would've even if Trump hadn't been elected). Now we just need to wonder how much tariffs and politics might drive the price up even more.\nThe flagship: iPhone Pro model prices\nApple hasn't always had an iPhone Pro variant, but it did starting in 2017 with the launch of the iPhone X, which had a starting price of $999. The phone debuted next to the $699 iPhone 8, making the 8's $50 increase seem like nothing.\nBut here's where things get interesting. Apple has never raised the price on the iPhone Pro model. The iPhone X, XS, 11 Pro, 12 Pro, 13 Pro, 14 Pro, 15 Pro and 16 Pro all cost $999. That's eight years without a price increase!\nWhat's even more shocking is when you correct for inflation: the 2017 iPhone X's $999 price would be $1,298 in 2025, according to the Consumer Price Index Inflation calculator. The iPhone Pro is overdue for a price hike, and I expect the iPhone 17 Pro to cost more.\nThe behemoths: iPhone Plus, Max and Pro Max prices\nSince 2014, Apple has sold a big version of the iPhone. Some of these were nothing more than a larger version of the standard iPhone with a bigger screen and battery as well as some minor differences, like the iPhone 6 Plus having optical image stabilization on its camera while the iPhone 6 didn't. But beginning with the iPhone 7 Plus, the larger version started having \"pro\" features, like a second rear camera and portrait mode.\nIn terms of pricing, the iPhone 6 Plus debuted at $749, which was $100 more than the iPhone 6. And that $749 price stuck around for the iPhone 6S Plus and 7 Plus. In 2017, Apple had three iPhone models: the $699 iPhone 8, the $749 iPhone 8 Plus (a $50 increase from the 7 Plus) and the $999 iPhone X.\nIn 2018, Apple launched the $1,099 iPhone XS Max, which I consider the true successor to the initial iPhone Plus line. That means the big iPhone got a $350 increase in a single year, the largest Apple has ever made. I admit some people might not think the XS Max is a follow-up to the Plus and would deem it an entirely new iPhone variant. But this is my commentary.\nLike the iPhone Pro, the Max and Pro Max would have the same price for years. In 2023, Apple raised the barrier of entry for the Pro Max model and didn't offer a $1,099 version of the iPhone 15 Pro Max with 128GB of storage. Instead, you had to pay $1,199 for the 256GB variant, which technically cost the same as the iPhone 14 Pro Max with 256GB of storage.\nThe iPhone 17 and 17 Pro's prices\nEven without tariffs, it's safe to assume that the iPhone 17 lineup's prices will be higher for some models. But when you factor in everything that's happened this year, it's hard to gauge just how much the price will go up and whether that'll affect just one or two models, or apply across the entire iPhone 17 line.\nEarlier this year, Apple raised the price on its most affordable model. Though it lacks the SE branding of the previous low-cost iPhone, the iPhone 16E came with a $599 price tag, $170 more than the $429 iPhone SE (2022).\nApple doesn't talk about unreleased products or their prices. But we do have an unusual-for-Apple clue as to how these tariffs could affect the company.\n\"Assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a quarterly earnings call on May 1.\nObviously, that $900 million number wasn't just for the iPhone, but for all Apple products. And that was three weeks before Trump threatened another tariff aimed purely at the iPhone. But $900 million is a lot for any company to swallow, and eventually that added cost will need to be made up for. That usually means higher prices, even if Apple is pressured by Trump to attribute the increase to \"new designs and features.\"\nIf there's one thing for certain, we'll know exactly what those prices will be when Apple launches the next generation of iPhone models at its September event.\nApple didn't respond to a request for comment."

However, there may be one limitation.\nIn a post this week, the leaker said the A19 Pro chip will have a 6-core GPU in the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, but only a 5-core GPU in the iPhone 17 Air. This means the iPhone 17 Air would have slightly slower graphics performance for gaming compared to the Pro models, but the average customer is unlikely to notice much of a difference.\nIn July 2024, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the iPhone 17 Air would be equipped with an A19 chip instead of an A19 Pro chip, so there are now conflicting rumors about the device's chip.

      "text": "Apple is expected to launch an all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air later this year, and while there have been plenty of rumors about the camera's overall design and thinness, we haven't heard any details about the device's weight and battery capacity until now.\nAccording to the leaker going by the account name \"yeux1122\" on the Korean-langauge Naver blog, the 6.6-inch iPhone 17 Air has a weight of approximately 145 grams, while the battery capacity is 2,800mAh. The details allegedly originate from a \"mass production confirmed sample.\" The blog has previously offered accurate insights into Apple's component strategy.\nThe claimed weight is similar to an iPhone SE 2 or iPhone 13 mini, which are 148 grams and 141 grams, respectively. As for the battery, the capacity figure is not unlike the iPhone 12, which has a 2,815mAh battery. However, the leaker's post does note that there remains a possibility that Apple will use a high-density battery in the iPhone 17 Air, which could increase its \"actual capacity\" by 15-20%.\nApple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in March that device will have a \"high-density\" battery. More recently, a report out of Asia has suggested that the iPhone 17 Air could become the first Apple smartphone to adopt advanced battery technology, with Apple supplier TDK preparing to ship its new generation of silicon-anode batteries by the end of June.\nHaving said that, reports have been mixed regarding the iPhone 17 Air's potential battery performance. The Information's Wayne Ma claimed the device will have \"worse\" battery life compared to previous iPhone models.\nIn internal testing, Apple apparently determined that the percentage of users who will be able to use the iPhone 17 Air for a full day without needing to recharge the device throughout the day will be between 60% and 70%, according to the report. For other iPhone models, the report said that metric is apparently between 80% and 90%.\nTo mitigate this problem, the report said that Apple is planning to release a battery case as an optional accessory for the iPhone 17 Air.\nOn the other hand, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has offered a more optimistic outlook, stating that battery life would be \"on par with current iPhones\" thanks to hardware and software optimizations.\nThe 5.5mm-thin device is also rumored to incorporate Apple's power-efficient C1 modem and lack an Ultra Wide camera, which could potentially provide more internal space for a larger battery. We'll know for sure when the device replaces the \"Plus\" model in Apple's iPhone 17 lineup, which is expected to launch around mid-September, per Apple's typical fall release schedule."

      "text": "Key takeaways:\n- The iPhone 17 could feature a redesigned camera bump, though it may not be as drastic a difference as the Pro models.\n- A higher refresh rate could be coming to the full lineup, potentially enabling the baseline iPhone to have an always-on display.\n- Prices remain uncertain with tariffs, but they'll likely go up, given it's been years since Apple raised the price of the iPhone.\nThe anticipated reveal of Apple's newest iPhone is just around the corner. For months now, rumors have been swirling about what the upcoming device, likely called the iPhone 17, could look like, from a redesigned camera module to fresh colors and a higher refresh rate. The phone is expected to debut in early September, although Apple hasn't confirmed anything yet. You can also check out our rumors on the iPhone 17 Pro and the thinner iPhone 17 Air.\nPerhaps the biggest looming question is whether iPhones could get pricier, especially with tariffs. President Donald Trump has said Apple will have to pay a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the US. This would almost certainly lead to a price hike for consumers. We'll have to wait to see how Apple responds and if shoppers really do end up shouldering that extra cost. But even without tariffs, the iPhone may be due for a markup, as it's been years since Apple raised prices on its handsets.\nHere's everything analysts and leakers predict about the baseline iPhone 17.\nSee also: Thinking About Buying a New iPhone? Here's Why You Should Wait\nCamera bump redesign\nIt's not an iPhone release without a camera upgrade, and there have been plenty of rumors about what the camera module could look like on Apple's upcoming phones. In January, a leaked image from Majin Bu on X suggested the phone could feature a pill-shaped camera bar, essentially resembling what you'd find on Google's Pixel 9 phone. In February, Bu followed up with CAD renders of what's said to be the iPhone 17 lineup, featuring horizontal camera bars, as well as larger rectangular bars on the iPhone 17 Pro models.\nIn April, Bloomberg reported the \"iPhone 17 Pro will look a lot more like the 16 Pro than anticipated,\" adding, \"From the front, the 17 Pro will appear quite similar to the 16 Pro. It's the back camera that will look meaningfully different.\" The latest rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Pro's three-lens camera arrangement will be maintained but will sit on a new panel that stretches across the phone's width and is the same color as the rest of the phone.\nLater in April, Bu again posted an image of the purported iPhone 17 lineup, showing those wider camera bars with the stacked lenses still configured to the left.\nNot until next year, for the 20th anniversary of the iPhone, will Apple be \"preparing a major shake-up\" for the phone's design, Bloomberg says. That includes a (long-rumored) foldable version and a \"bold new Pro model that makes more extensive use of glass.\"\nAnother camera-related rumor is that the selfie camera on all iPhone 17 models will be upgraded to 24 megapixels, according to analyst Jeff Pu. That's a decent bump from the current 12-megapixel front-facing camera on the iPhone 16 lineup, although it's important to remember that more megapixels don't automatically mean better photos. Still, given how much people increasingly rely on their front cameras to snap selfies and record videos for TikTok and Instagram, this surely will be a welcome advancement.\niPhone 17 display upgrade\nRumor has it that all models of the iPhone 17 will feature a 120Hz display, bumping the non-Pro models up from their current 60Hz refresh rate. That could be a welcome change, as the discrepancy between the Pro and non-Pro refresh rate is surprising; when Apple debuted the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus with a 60Hz display, there was a bit of an outcry from folks who expected more in 2024. This rumored update could remedy that -- and possibly bring the always-on display to the baseline model.\nThere's been a lot of back-and-forth about whether the latest iPhones will have a scratch-resistant, anti-reflective display. A July report from MacRumors suggests that feature will in fact be arriving on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, just not the baseline iPhone 17 or the Air. This would make the Pro models the first iPhones with an anti-reflective screen, giving them a feature that CNET's Patrick Holland deemed one of the best attributes of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nThere also have been contradictory reports on whether the Dynamic Island on the iPhone 17 lineup will look any different. In May, Pu said all iPhone 17 models will use a new metalens technology for the proximity sensor, which could allow Apple to reduce the size of the Face ID sensor and the Dynamic Island, according to 9to5Mac. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, on the other hand, said in January that the Dynamic Island would remain \"largely unchanged\" in the iPhone 17 lineup compared to the iPhone 16. We'll have to see what ends up being true.\nRumors on what frames the iPhone 17 lineup will feature have gone back and forth. In February, Pu suggested the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all have aluminum frames. He noted that the iPhone 17 Air could be the outlier with a titanium frame.\nNew chipset\nIn May, Pu noted the iPhone 17 would have the same A18 chip used in the iPhone 16, while the iPhone 17 Air and Pro models will feature an A19 chip. It's possible the phones could also include the Apple-developed 5G modem, called the C1 chip, which debuted on the iPhone 16E.\nIn February, Kuo noted Apple will swap out Broadcom's Wi-Fi chips for in-house chips across the iPhone 17 lineup, stating this would \"enhance connectivity across Apple devices.\" It's not yet clear what exactly this would mean, but it would be interesting if Apple's C1 chip was also accompanied by its own Wi-Fi chip.\niPhone 17 battery\nSo far, rumors suggest only the pricer iPhone 17 Pro Max could get a bigger battery, according to Ice Universe. The leaker says the top-of-the-line phone could go from 8.25mm on the iPhone 16 Pro Max to 8.725mm on the iPhone 17 Pro Max as a result. In addition, leaker Instant Digital suggests the high-end phone could have about a 5,000 mAh battery, a notable increase over the 4,685 mAh on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, according to third-party tests.\nBut that doesn't mean the baseline version won't get any boost. Even if battery capacity stays the same (which it may not), the AI-powered Adaptive Power feature arriving with iOS 26 can help extend battery life. The feature automatically adjusts your iPhone's performance based on how you're using it at the moment, according to Apple. This could especially be helpful with the slimmer iPhone 17 Air, which will likely also have a thinner battery.\niOS 26 brings a fresh look\nApple has revamped its mobile operating system with iOS 26 (not iOS 19), which is named after the last two digits of the upcoming year. And with iPadOS, MacOS, WatchOS, TVOS and VisionOS following the same naming convention, the move is designed to bring more uniformity -- naming-wise and appearance-wise -- across the operating systems.\nThe new Liquid Glass interface brings a more transparent, lens-like look to the iPhone and other Apple devices. With iOS 26, the Camera app also adopts a more minimalistic design and Photos once again makes it easier to find your albums by adding separate tabs for your Library and Collections, instead of forcing you to scroll through a single cluttered screen. Updates to Messages include being able to add backgrounds to chat windows and create polls in group chats, and a new screening tool can better detect spam texts and move messages from unknown senders to a dedicated folder. You can read more about iOS 26 features here.\nIn April, tipster Digital Chat Station noted that given the use of Apple Intelligence and AI on a \"large scale,\" the iPhone 17 lineup will come with 12GB of RAM, instead of the current 8GB. Kuo noted the iPhone 17 Air and Pro models would sport that increased 12GB of RAM, but that Apple was still deciding whether to equip the baseline model with 8GB or 12GB of RAM. In May, Pu noted the baseline would remain at 8GB.\nPrice and release date\nWe expect the iPhone 17 to become available in September although it's not yet clear exactly when, as Apple hasn't confirmed anything.\nHistorically, Apple has unveiled its new iPhones on the first Tuesday of September after Labor Day. However, the first Tuesday in 2025 is the day after Labor Day so it's possible Apple could either push its iPhone event to Wednesday, Sept. 3, or hold it the following week on Tuesday, Sept. 9.\nThat would mean the phones could then become available on either Sept. 12 or 19. Preorders would kick off a week before general availability, on either Sept. 5 or 12.\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman has said that the new iPhone announcement should come Sept. 9 or 10.\nPrice is also a big unknown. Jefferies analyst Edison Lee has said the iPhone 17 Air, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max will get a $50 price increase to offset tariffs and the higher cost of components, but didn't mention the baseline iPhone 17. If that's true, the starting prices for the full lineup could be:\n- iPhone 17: $829\n- iPhone 17 Air: $979\n- iPhone 17 Pro: $1,049\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max: $1,249\nRegardless of higher component costs or tariffs, the iPhone is overdue for a price increase, because the last price hike was five years ago.\nThe latest rumors suggest the iPhone 17 could be available in black, blue, silver, purple and green.\nWe'll continue to update this piece as more rumors surface so be sure to follow along."

In an investor note seen by 9to5Mac, Pu says that the iPhone 17 models will feature a refreshed design, front-facing camera improvements, a smaller Dynamic Island, and more.\nPu also says that Apple will introduce a new \u201ciPhone 17 Slim\u201d model that replaces the \u201cPlus\u201d model in the lineup.\niPhone 17 rumors: New \u2018iPhone 17 Slim\u2019 model and more\nHere is the iPhone 17 lineup as reported by Pu:\n- iPhone 17: 6.1-inch display\n- iPhone 17 Slim: 6.6-inch display\n- iPhone 17 Pro: 6.3-inch display\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max: 6.9-inch display\nIn terms of design, Pu reports that the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Slim, and iPhone 17 Pro will all feature an aluminum design that is \u201cmore complex.\u201d The iPhone 17 Pro Max, meanwhile, will still be made out of titanium. The iPhone 17 Pro Max will also feature a \u201cnarrowed Dynamic Island,\u201d while the other models will retain the current design.\nThe smaller Dynamic Island on the iPhone 17 Pro Max will be made possible by a new \u201cmetalens\u201d technology for the proximity sensor.

This new iPhone 17 model will replace the \u201cPlus\u201d and offer a \u201cslim design,\u201d Pu says. No further details on the design are included in the report.\nIn terms of performance and specs, Pu reports:\n- iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Slim: 8GB RAM, A18 or A19 chip\n- iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max: 12GB RAM, A19 Pro chip\nCurrently, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature 6GB of RAM, while the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max have 8GB of RAM. With the iPhone 16 lineup this year, Apple will unify on 8GB across the whole lineup. Then, according to Pu, the bifurcation will return with the iPhone 17 lineup in 2025.\nAll four iPhone 17 models will feature 24MP front-facing cameras, according to Pu. This is a notable upgrade compared to the current 12MP front-facing cameras used by Apple. Ming-Chi Kuo also previously reported that the iPhone 17 would feature an upgraded 24MP front camera.\nFollow Chance: Threads, Twitter, Instagram, and Mastodon.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "Pros\n- Does most of the Apple stuff I want\n- Battery life is great so far\n- Matte finish back\n- The rear camera is good\n- A18 chip performance\nCons\n- $599 price isn't cheap\n- Odd value proposition\n- Lacks MagSafe\n- Screen is good, but wonder how it will age\nI'm holding the $599 iPhone 16E in the air -- think Statue of Liberty pose -- as I stand on the roof of CNET's six-story office building to test the new phone's Emergency SOS via Satellite feature. In a matter of seconds, the 16E is connected to a satellite despite being in the middle of downtown San Francisco. I can't think of any other $600 phone that can do this.\nSatellite connectivity isn't necessarily at the top of the list for what people want in their phone. Usually, it's good battery life (which the iPhone 16E has), a good camera (the 16E checks that off too) and a decent price (which the 16E just misses).\nApple took a Taco Bell-like approach with the iPhone 16E, mixing and matching parts and features from prior phones to create a \"new\" iPhone. Its design and screen are similar to the iPhone 14. Its A18 processor is the same as the one in the iPhone 16. And this gives the iPhone 16E a weird value proposition. It's new, but it's old. It's affordable, but not cheap.\nAfter testing the iPhone 16E for six days, I was surprised the most by how wonderfully uneventful it was to use. Along with all the standard iOS 18 functions and goodies, like iMessage and FaceTime, I used Apple Intelligence, made calls on 5G, took a bunch of share-worthy photos and videos and played video games like Resident Evil 4.\nWhat more could you want, right?\nI can also do all of these things on the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro, but don't need to pay as much to do so with the 16E. I wouldn't call the iPhone 16E a budget or cheap phone. But it does plenty to earn that $600 price, even if it does miss that $500 sweet spot other affordable phones like the Google Pixel 8A hit.\nIf you can get a discount or a carrier deal to lower the price, the iPhone 16E's value becomes even better.\niPhone 16E review: Should you buy it?\nIf you're rocking an iPhone SE, an iPhone 11 or older, the 16E will be a nice upgrade in every way, from the camera to the battery life -- though you might miss that ultrawide camera. I also think that this is a good phone for people using Android phones who want to switch and dip the proverbial toe into Apple's waters.\nThe iPhone 16E could be a solid option for teenagers as well as adults who don't care about having the most cutting-edge phone tech, especially if they're on an iPhone that's four or five years old.\nBetween the 16E and the iPhone 15, I'd go with the 16E, as long as you're OK not having the Dynamic Island, an ultrawide camera and MagSafe. The 16E's A18 processor is its secret sauce and will no doubt be supported longer than the iPhone 15's A16 Bionic hand-me-down chip which came out on the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022.\nChoosing between the iPhone 16 and the 16E is a bit tougher. If you have the budget, I'd go with the regular 16. You get a brighter screen, MagSafe, and an ultrawide camera that doubles as a macro lens -- great for taking close-up photos like of food since the main camera automatically switches to a cropped version of the ultrawide in order to nail focus.\nIf you're wondering whether to buy the iPhone 16E now or wait for the iPhone 17 to come out, that's complicated. Even if the iPhone 17 were out today, it's meant for a different person compared with the iPhone 16E which Apple positions as a \"value\" iPhone. I can't think of any phone, from Apple or anyone else, that I'd wait six months to buy.\niPhone iPhone 16E design\nThe iPhone 16E's flat-sided design is similar to every phone Apple launched since the iPhone 12, aside from the SE. The back glass has a sophisticated textured matte finish, which looks understated and gives the iPhone 16E a more premium air. There's no camera bump sticking out of the back, just a single lens, which makes the black iPhone 16E I've been testing have some serious 2001: A Space Odyssey monolith vibes.\nThe iPhone 16E's screen reminds me of the one on the iPhone 14. It's 6.1 inches and has an old school-style notch at the top to house the selfie camera and FaceID tech. The notch didn't bother me in use, but I did miss having the Dynamic Island and seeing background activities, like a timer at the top of my screen count down as I'm cooking. The iPhone 16E seems aimed at folks with older iPhones that don't even have the Dynamic Island. So they won't know what they're missing.\nIn everyday use, even outdoors, the screen looks good. I wish the 16E (and the iPhone 16 for that matter) had a high-refresh rate screen -- what Apple calls Pro Motion. Nearly all Android phones at this price or cheaper have one. I guess if you want a better screen with a high-refresh rate, there's always the iPhone 16 Pro. I think the 16E's screen will age better than the 4.7-inch one on the last iPhone SE did. But what will it be like to use the 16E in three or four years?\nThe iPhone 16E lacks support for MagSafe, the magnetic connection system on the back of the phone, which isn't the end of the world. I imagine that people who don't have an iPhone with MagSafe won't know what they're missing -- notice a theme here? But in a household shared with someone who does have an iPhone with MagSafe as well as charging stands, I could see that being a bit annoying. My guess is that phone case companies will make iPhone 16E cases with magnets that will allow the 16E to work with magnetic stands and accessories.\niPhone 16E cameras\nThe iPhone 16E has a single rear camera. I've said it before, but I'd rather have one really good camera than the two or three mediocre ones that can often be found on budget phones. The 16E's main camera takes lovely photos, even when using night mode. It has a 48-megapixel sensor, which has enough resolution for sensor cropping to offer a 2x magnification, and the results are decent. Images look sharp, have a nice dynamic range (good for high-contrast lighting like sunrises/sunsets), and colors are attractively subdued.\nIs the iPhone 16 more versatile with its second rear camera that's an ultrawide lens? Yes. Does the iPhone 16 Pro take better photos? Yes. The iPhone 16E is great for someone who just wants to document a moment and share it with friends and family or post a quick selfie to Instagram or a video on TikTok.\niPhone 16E modem and 5G calls\nThe iPhone 16E's actually has a new feature that no other Apple phone does: a modem. Most people have no idea what kind of modem their phone has and just want assurance that they get a signal and can reliably make voice or video calls that sound good. And the iPhone 16E delivers on both accounts. Phone calls sounded clear and video calls over 5G never froze.\nTechnically, it's impressive that Apple designed the C1 modem (it's first), and the calls I made on the iPhone 16E (indoors, outdoors around San Francisco on AT&T) sounded good and clear.\nI was able to use 5G to download apps on the go like PGA Tour Pro Golf (2.4GB) in less than a minute. I was also able to stream Severance on the Apple TV Plus app over 5G with no problem.\niPhone 16E and 16 Pro Max 5G speeds on AT&T\n| 16E download speed | 525Mbps | 110Mbps | 196Mbps | 112Mbps | 188Mbps |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 16E upload speed | 143Mbps | 18Mbps | 47.2Mbps | 16.8Mbps | 43.1Mbps |\n| 16 Pro Max download speed | - | 152Mbps | 215Mbps | 163Mbps | 312Mbps |\n| 16 Pro Max upload speed | - | 3Mbps | 33Mbps | 4.45Mbps | 44.9Mbps |\nI ran tests side by side with an iPhone 16 Pro Max that was also on AT&T using the Speed Test app by Ookla, which is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis. And while the 16 Pro Max had faster download speeds, the 16E's results were still good. In fact, its upload speeds beat the 16 Pro Max, which means selfies and videos post quickly to Instagram and TikTok, while video calls look and sound good without any freezes.\niPhone 16E battery, iOS and services\nI've had the 16E for six days and only had to charge it three times. I used a 30-watt wall charger, and the 16E went from empty to 59% in 30 minutes. And I've been using the phone heavily, testing the cameras, running Apple Intelligence tools and playing graphics intensive games.\nThe iPhone 16E can definitely make it through a day on a single charge and, depending on how you use it, it'll likely make it through a day and a half before needing to be plugged in.\nIn CNET's video streaming battery test with the battery charged to 100%, the iPhone 16E didn't drop a single percent after an hour. Compare that to the iPhone 16 and iPhone 15, each of which dropped to 97% after an hour in the same test. I have more battery tests to run, but so far the iPhone 16E has a great battery life.\nThe iPhone 16E is powered by Apple's A18 chip, just like the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus. The only difference is the version in the 16E has four GPU cores instead of five. In everyday use, the phone had no issues playing video games, editing and saving videos and using Apple Intelligence. In benchmark test for the CPU, the iPhone 16E scored higher than the iPhone 16, iPhone 15 and iPhone SE.\nIn benchmark test for graphic performance, you can really see the difference that the iPhone 16's extra GPU core has over the iPhone 16E. It's also notable that the iPhone 15 bests the iPhone 16E in terms of graphical power.\nThe iPhone 16E is a gateway into Apple's software and services. iOS 18 runs smoothly. Being able to customize the home screen and control center adds a nice personal touch, and I also get all of Apple's emergency features, including satellite support to reach emergency responders when there's no cell signal.\nThe iPhone 16E doesn't have every Apple bell and whistle, but the company wisely included many of the best ones.\niPhone 16E last thoughts\n$600 is a lot of money, at least for me, but I think the iPhone 16E is worth it. I do recommend looking into carrier deals, discounts and trade-ins to drop that price a bit, unless you're set on doing an installment plan over a couple of years. Even if Apple made a version of this phone that's closer to $500, it would have had to omit or compromise on more features. I wonder how the iPhone 16E's value will look in the fall when the iPhone 17 is released and there's all the deals and discounts for it.\nAfter nearly a week with the iPhone 16E, I'm happy to say it's a good phone and will be a solid upgrade from older iPhone models.\nApple iPhone 16E Specs vs. Apple iPhone 16, iPhone SE (2022), iPhone 15\n| Apple iPhone 16E | Apple iPhone 16 | Apple iPhone SE (2022) | Apple iPhone 15 | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED display; 2,532x1,170 pixels; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED display; 2,556 x 1,179 pixels; 60Hz refresh rate | 4.7-inch LCD; 1,334 x 750 pixels; 60 Hz refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556 x 1,179 pixels; 60hz refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 460ppi | 460ppi | 326ppi | 460ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 5.78 x 2.82 x 0.31 in. | 5.81 x 2.82 x 0.31 in. | 5.45 x 2.65 x 0.29 in | 2.82 x 5.81 x 0.31 in. |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 146.7 x 71.5 x 7.8 mm | 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm | 138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3 mm | 71.6 x 147.6 x 7.8 mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 167g (5.88 oz.) | 170g (6 oz.) | 144g (5.09 oz.) | 171g (6.02 oz.) |\n| Mobile software | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 15 | iOS 17 |\n| Camera | 48-megapixel (wide) | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 12-megapixel (wide) | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) |\n| Front-facing camera | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 7-megapixel | 12-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K |\n| Processor | Apple A18 | Apple A18 | Apple A15 Bionic | Apple A16 Bionic |\n| RAM/storage | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 64GB, 128GB, 256GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB |\n| Expandable storage | None | None | None | None |\n| Battery | Up to 26 hours video playback, 21 hours streamed video playback, 90 hours of audio playback. 20W wired charging, 7.5W Qi wireless charging | Up to 22 hours video playback; up to 18 hours video playback (streamed). 20W wired charging.

We test a phone's features, play games and take photos. We examine the display to see if it's bright, sharp and vibrant. We analyze the design and build to see how it is to hold and whether it has an IP-rating for water resistance. We push the processor's performance to the extremes using standardized benchmark tools like GeekBench and 3DMark, along with our own anecdotal observations navigating the interface, recording high-resolution videos and playing graphically intense games at high refresh rates.\nAll the cameras are tested in a variety of conditions from bright sunlight to dark indoor scenes. We try out special features like night mode and portrait mode and compare our findings against similarly priced competing phones. We also check out the battery life by using it daily as well as running a series of battery drain tests.\nWe take into account additional features like support for 5G, satellite connectivity, fingerprint and face sensors, stylus support, fast charging speeds and foldable displays, among others that can be useful. We balance all of this against the price to give you the verdict on whether that phone, whatever price it is, actually represents good value. While these tests may not always be reflected in CNET's initial review, we conduct follow-up and long-term testing in most circumstances."

      "text": "Apple has consistently released a new iPhone each fall since the launch of the iPhone 4S a decade and a half ago. But it appears the company may be shifting its release strategy in the coming years.\nAccording to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, along with a report from The Information, Apple plans to launch its lower-cost iPhones in the first half of the year and reserve its higher-end Pro models for later in the year. Kuo noted online that the next iPhone 17 lineup will launch as expected this fall, but future iterations, including the iPhone 18 and iPhone 19, will debut in two waves through 2027.\nApple will launch its more affordable iPhones in the early months of the year, likely in March or April, with Pro models arriving in the fall. This means you'll see different versions of the iPhone 18 and iPhone 19 released in both halves of the same year, Kuo said.\nFor example, the base-level iPhone 18 and iPhone 18E will likely hit in the spring, while the iPhone 18 Pro, Pro Max, iPhone 18 \"Air\" (or \"Slim\") and Apple's first foldable model would launch in the fall. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe iPhone maker has announced new phones outside its typical September window. The lower-end iPhone 16E, for instance, debuted in February. But it was following on from the main iPhone 16 launch five months earlier with the higher-end models. The change that Kuo describes would rejigger that order, putting all of a new lineups releases in the same calendar year.\nThe speculation is that this change in strategy would allow Apple to optimize manufacturing and marketing efforts, particularly in China, a key market for the company. Also, leading rival Samsung announces its new Galaxy phones in January.\n\"Competitors typically release new models in [the first half of the year],\" Kuo wrote. \"By launching new iPhones in [the first half, Apple could close the marketing gap.\" He added: \"Due to intense competition, Apple needs to offer more iPhone models. Launching them all in (the second half) risks diluting marketing efforts.\" Kuo also said the growing shipment ratio of the Pro series is overshadowing budget models.\nIn the near term, Apple is expected to launch a much thinner iPhone this year, potentially named the iPhone 17 Air or iPhone 17 Slim. The 6.6-inch device is rumored to be just 5.5 millimeters thin and priced between $900 and $1,000. At the same time, Kuo noted that Apple is also developing a next-generation version with a larger screen, expected to arrive in the latter half of 2027."
