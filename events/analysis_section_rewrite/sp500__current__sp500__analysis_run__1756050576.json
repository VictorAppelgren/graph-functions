      "feedback": "Strong; to lift to world‑class, rewrite as two crisp, 0–3 week scenarios with explicit causality, quantified thresholds, and a single, testable invalidation rule per theme, then tighten the language to remove hedges and align strictly to the cited data. For Malik Beasley, convert to a tight cap/agency chain: (1) immediate driver is Detroit exhausting its 14.1M non‑taxpayer MLE by signing Caris LeVert (2-year, $28.9M), leaving Beasley with only what non‑Bird rights allow (about $7.2M starting) and opening outsized bid competition from Nets (cap space), Wizards, Bulls, and Kings that still have usable exceptions or cap room (as noted in the Pistons’ constraint and the cap/exception landscape) (XB5ZRN1VP); (2) near‑term catalysts are Beasley’s signing decision and any cap moves by those rivals that could outbid Detroit; (3) invalidation triggers are Beasley signing for a value materially north of $7.2M/year or a reactivation of the probe reducing interest; (4) key levels to watch over the next 0–3 weeks are Pistons’ cap dynamics vs Nets/Wizards/Bulls MLE/space, and the pace of any in‑season maneuver (Early Bird rights implications). For Shopify, present a separate, earnings‑driven arc: (1) 0–3 weeks drivers are the Q2 print and guidance: GMV up 27% YoY to about $163B, revenue up ~29% to just over $5B in H1 2025, operating income up ~51% with some Q1 unrealized losses, and AI/no‑code ecosystem (Sidekick, Shopify Magic) feeding growth; (2) near‑term catalysts are sustained GMV/revenue momentum and a mid‑to‑high‑20s revenue growth forecast, offset by a high valuation (roughly P/E ~70, P/S ~18) and the SFN pivot; (3) invalidation would come from a material deceleration in GMV growth or margin deterioration that compresses multiples; (4) monitoring next: the trajectory of GMV growth, merchant add‑ins, AI tooling uptake, and any guidance updates; (5) keep Moscow‑area risk on the radar as a macro risk‑off signal that could pressure growth stocks in the 0–3 week window. Use the following citations for precise anchors: Beasley cap dynamics and MLE constraints from XB5ZRN1VP; Beasley’s no‑longer‑target nuance from XB5ZRN1VP; Shopify’s Q2 metrics and growth profile from 19NO2GMNF and QGXA2WQJ3; macro/risk context from NBX9RA9WX.",
