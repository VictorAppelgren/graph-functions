  "title": "Spider-Man 4 could finally bring Venom to the MCU, as the Scorpion's comic book history hints at the Spidey versus Symbiote battle we've always deserved on the big screen",
  "description": "Mac Gargan is confirmed as one of the villains of Spider-Man: Brand New Day, and he might become the MCU's Venom",
  "content": "It's now fully confirmed that actor Michael Mando will reprise his role as the Scorpion for Spider-Man: Brand New Day, the fourth film in Marvel Studios and Sony's joint Spidey franchise. What we don't quite know yet is exactly how he'll embody the role, and how closely it'll resemble the comic book history of Mac Gargan, the Scorpion.\n\nWhat's interesting is that Mando has been teasing that he may be playing not just Scorpion, but Venom as well. No, that doesn't mean he'll be playing two separate characters. On the contrary, it seems Brand New Day may in fact depict Mac Gargan's turn from being the original Scorpion to becoming the new host of the Venom symbiote.\n\nThat change also led to Gargan joining the Thunderbolts as Venom, and later the Dark Avengers as its faux-Spider-Man. That history could have big implications for Mac Gargan's place in the MCU - and it could finally deliver the big screen Spider-Man/Venom showdown we've always deserved.\n\nSo what's the deal with the Scorpion, and how did he turn into Venom? We'll explain it all right now.\n\nThe comic history of the Scorpion\n\nMac Gargan first debuted all the way back in 1964's Amazing Spider-Man #19 by Steve Ditko and Stan Lee before being transformed into the Scorpion in #20. When Gargan was first introduced, he was a private investigator hired by J. Jonah Jameson to figure out Peter Parker's connection to Spider-Man.\n\nBut the scheme fails, leading Jameson to enlist Gargan as the subject of an experiment to create an enforcer capable of defeating Spider-Man. Gargan is transformed into the Scorpion by scientist Dr. Farley Stillwell, who imbues him with scorpion-like powers similar to Spidey's famous spider-powers while also equipping him with a special suit that includes an acid-dripping stinger.\n\nWhile Scorpion essentially becomes the first anti-Spider-Man, even coming close to defeating the Wall-Crawler once and for all, Gargan soon discovers his new powers are a curse, having transformed him into something inhuman.\n\nGargan is driven to rage-filled madness by his metamorphosis, going on to menace both Spider-Man and J. Jonah Jameson over the years, while also taking on other heroes, notably Captain America and Carol Danvers, and later joining the Masters of Evil and a more recent iteration of the venerable villain team the Sinister Six.\n\nBut that's just scratching the surface of Mac Gargan's role in the Marvel Universe. After a long career as the Scorpion, he bonded with the Venom symbiote, turning it back into a villainous monster after years of operating as a \"Lethal Protector\" with the original Venom Eddie Brock.\n\nHow the Scorpion became Venom\n\nGargan's transformation into Venom happened early in his employ as a henchman of Norman Osborne, also known as the Green Goblin, who employed Scorpion to spy on Peter Parker. But during the course of his mission, he came into contact with the Venom symbiote, which was recently separated from Eddie Brock.\n\nThough he first attempted to reject the symbiote, Gargan eventually ascents to bonding with it, becoming a new Venom that took the character back its villainous roots rather than Eddie Brock's evolution into an anti-hero.\n\nAs Venom, Gargan went on to join Osborn's merciless incarnation of the Thunderbolts, which was essentially transformed into a black-ops hit squad run by Osborn on behalf of the government. Through his time on the Thunderbolts, Gargan found himself driven more and more by the symbiote's inherent blood lust, fearing that he'd lose control entirely.\n\nHowever, after a brutal battle with his former Thunderbolts ally the Swordsman which left him gravely wounded, Gargan fully embraced the symbiote's monstrous nature as it saved his life by healing his injuries.\n\nGargan's connection to Norman Osborne led him to be recruited to Osborne's Dark Avengers, with the symbiote taking on a much less monstrous form resembling Peter Parker when he first bonded with the symbiote. As part of the team, Gargan impersonated Spider-Man much like the other members impersonated other Avengers, including Moonstone posing as Carol Danvers (in her Ms. Marvel guise) and Bullseye taking on the role of Osborne's ersatz Hawkeye.\n\nEventually, Gargan was separated from the symbiote in a battle with the real Spider-Man, going on to be incarcerated in the supervillain prison known as the Raft. Gargan was later broken out by mad scientist Alistar Smythe, who upgraded him with a new high-tech Scorpion suit.\n\nGargan used his newfound powers to assassinate J. Jonah Jameson's wife - a tragedy that eventually led Peter Parker's Aunt May to get temporarily engaged to Jameson. Gargan's been the Scorpion since, though he's had a few encounters with the Venom symbiote over the years.\n\nAll of that history could have some very interesting implications for Michael Mando's MCU Scorpion, who was only seen briefly in Spider-Man: Homecoming as a very human gangster. Mando has been posting some images teasing his role on Instagram story (via ComicBook), including posting the cover of Amazing Spider-Man #573 (seen below), an issue which revolves around Gargan becoming a kind of Scorpion/Venom hybrid.\n\nVenom hasn't technically fully appeared in the MCU just yet, though Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock, himself the star of his own trilogy of Venom movies in a separate continuity, did have a brief cameo in the stinger scene of Spider-Man: No Way Home in which he traveled to the MCU, leaving a small glob of symbiote goo behind when he returned to his own reality.\n\nFrom there, it's really just a hop, skip, and a jump for that little bit of the Venom symbiote to make its way to New York to bond with Gargan.\n\nThe biggest lingering question is, will Scorpion get his initial powers and battlesuit, or will they skip straight to Mac Gargan being the MCU's Venom? The latter wouldn't be out of the question, especially as it provides a layer of separation between Sony's ultimately heroic portrayal of Venom and one who fits more into the mold of one of Spider-Man's arch-enemies.\n\nA version of the Scorpion appeared in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse with a cybernetic body loaded with weapons and eight creepy robot-legs. Meanwhile, Venom appeared somewhat notoriously in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3, played by Topher Grace.\n\nIf Mac Gargan does indeed become the MCU's Venom, that could finally give us the truly monstrous Venom vs. Spider-Man showdown we've always deserved to see on the big screen. And of course, that's not even getting into his potential connections to the Thunderbolts/New Avengers.\n\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day, directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, will swing into theaters on July 31, 2026. For more, here is our complete guide to upcoming Marvel movies and Marvel Phase 6.",

      "text": "Spider-Man: Homecoming and Better Call Saul star teases his villain\u2019s return for Brand New Day with just one simple word: \"Sting\"\nMichael Mando is back\nAs filming kicks off for Spider-Man: Brand New Day, Michael Mando has confirmed his return as ruthless gangster Mac Gargan, aka The Scorpion.\nThe actor shared a selfie to his personal Instagram account with the infamous scorpion tattoo on his neck, followed by one word: \"Sting.\" You might recall that Spider-Man: Homecoming ended with The Scorpion getting knocked off the Staten Island Ferry and getting apprehended by the FBI. He and Adrian Toomes, aka Vulture (Michael Keaton), end up in the same prison together, with Scorpion telling Vulture that he plans to get out of prison and get his revenge on Spider-Man once and for all. You can view the photo below.\nA leaked photo from the set of Brand New Day shows a construction area with a completion date of \"December 2027\". If Spider-Man: Homecoming took place in 2016, that marks some 10 years in prison for Scorpion, and it's likely he may have been released if not for good behavior or by way of finding a legal loophole.\nA post shared by Michael Mando (@michaelmando)\nA photo posted by on\nIt would also be pretty cool if Mando's Scorpion ends up taking a page out of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and leans more into Scorpion becoming a cybernetically-enhanced, scaly suit-wearing weirdo... which some fans think Mando is teasing via his Instagram story.\nThe story posts in question include the classic, all-green Scorpion action figure, as comic book artwork, where Scorpion is standing behind Venom. This looks to be artwork from the 2005 comic Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #10, where Mac Gargan becomes the third host of the Venom symbiote. A fan theory about Gargan becoming Venom in the MCU actually popped up right after No Way Home, thanks to that Eddie Brock post-credits scene, though it seems more likely that we'll see a fully-realized Scorpion first (especially given the fact that Tom Hardy previously said that he doesn't see Eddie appearing in Spider-Man 4).\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day hits cinemas on July 31, 2026 as part of Marvel Phase 6.

The Fantastic Four: First Steps is out now in theaters, and it briefly introduces us to Doctor Doom \u2013 the newest threat to Earth-616... and beyond.\nBut there's still one more movie to go before we officially see the Fantastic Four take on Doctor Doom in Avengers: Doomsday, and that's Spider-Man: Brand New Day. Filming is currently underway on the fourth Spider-Man movie, which sees the return of Mark Ruffalo's Hulk and Michael Mando's Scorpion.\nScroll on down for our guide to all the movies and TV series in Marvel Phase 6. For a more comprehensive list of every MCU title heading our way, check out our guide to all of the upcoming superhero movies and shows on the near horizon.\nMarvel Phase 6 release dates\nAs revealed by Kevin Feige way back at San Diego Comic-Con 2022, there are a fair few entries in Marvel Phase 6 to come \u2013 although there have been some delays and changes since then. The confirmed release dates are as follows:\n- The Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025) [Cinemas] \u2013 out now!\n- Eyes of Wakanda \u2013 August 1, 2025 \u2013 out now!\n- Marvel Zombies \u2013 October 3, 2025\n- Wonder Man \u2013 TBC 2025\n- Untitled Marvel movie \u2013 February 13, 2026\n- Spider-Man 4 \u2013 July 31, 2026\n- Untitled Marvel Movie \u2013 November 6, 2026\n- Avengers: Doomsday \u2013 December 18, 2026\n- Daredevil: Born Again season 2 \u2013 TBC 2026\n- Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man season 2 \u2013 TBC 2026\n- Vision Quest \u2013 TBC 2026\n- Avengers: Secret Wars \u2013 December 17, 2027\n- Untitled Marvel movie \u2013 February 18, 2028\n- Untitled Marvel movie \u2013 May 5, 2028\n- Untitled Marvel movie \u2013 November 10, 2028\nDuring Marvel's panel at San Diego Comic-Con 2024, it was revealed that three additional movies to the three already planned would be happening. And in October 2024, Deadline shared how another three movies were also in the works for 2028.\nThere is currently no word on what five of those six movies are, but it has been revealed that the film in the July 31, 2026 slot will be Spider-Man 4 \u2013 with Tom Holland back as Peter Parker. Below, we've gone into detail on the four that are set in stone, as well as the Marvel series with firm release dates, while we wait for more information.\nFantastic Four\nRelease date: July 25, 2025\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nFlame on! The MCU's take on Fantastic Four, titled The Fantastic Four: First Steps, is out in cinemas now. So, be sure to read our The Fantastic Four: First Steps review for a head start ahead of buying any tickets. This marks the first entry in Marvel Phase 6, so it's a biggie, folks. Set on Earth 828, the film starts as a separate entity from the rest of the Marvel timeline in general, focusing on the super team's face-off against the devourer of worlds, Galactus, and his herald, the Silver Surfer.\nHowever, without giving away any spoilers, it does signal the team joining the wider MCU by the end of the film and starts setting the blocks for the new Avengers movies as well. The Last of Us' Pedro Pascal is Reed Richards, Mission: Impossible's Vanessa Kirby is Sue Storm, The Bear's Ebon Moss-Bachrach is Ben Grimm (AKA The Thing), and Stranger Things' Joseph Quinn is Johnny Storm (AKA Human Torch).\nEyes of Wakanda\nRelease date: August 1, 2025\nEyes of Wakanda is streaming now on Disney Plus. The four-episode animated mini-series tells the story of the Hatut Zeraze, who embark on dangerous missions in order to retrieve vibranium artifacts in different eras of world history.\nWithout giving too much away, episode 3 reveals a new version of Iron Fist, a hero first introduced via Netflix series in 2017 as part of the MCU (but pre-dating the Marvel Disney Plus TV show era).\nThis version, a woman named Jorani, was created entirely for the new series, and she's an almost mystical, immortal being with good morale and honor (in contrast to the grit and grime of the Iron Fist Netflix series).\nBecause the show takes place six centuries before the MCU, we might not see Jorani make her way into live-action... though we'd really like to.\nMarvel Zombies\nRelease date: October 3, 2025\nMarvel Zombies (unlike Eyes of Wakanda) is set in an alternate timeline to the rest of the major Marvel movies. This means that although it's technically part of Marvel Phase 6, it's not connected to the continuity of the franchise and can be skipped if you are really pressed for time. However, if you're a horror fan, you'll want to check out this upcoming Disney Plus series regardless.\nCreated by Zeb Wells, Marvel Zombies will follow a group of survivors who now have to deal with former heroes and villains who have been turned into the undead. What's scarier than a brain-hungry monster? Try one with superpowers! Marvel Zombies is set to hit Disney Plus on October 3, 2025, and will consist of four episodes. Sounds like a perfect pre-Halloween treat if you ask us.\nSpider-Man 4\nRelease date: July 31, 2026\nWe now have a new release date for the next Spider-Man! Spider-Man 4 will arrive right before Avengers: Doomsday. Originally, it was scheduled to appear after the new Avengers movie and was rumored to be a direct sequel to the events of that flick. However, that's pretty much out the window now, so we're back to square one when it comes to speculating the upcoming movie's plot.\nHowever, we do know that Tom Holland is returning to play our main hero; however, he is also set to star in Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey, which will release on July 17, 2026. So, we may see some more filming delays if shooting schedules clash. We'll keep you posted on any updates, but for now, there's no indication of production issues. We're also waiting to learn more about the movie since Marvel has been keeping pretty tight-lipped about the future film's plot. Principal photography is expected to kick off this summer, so hopefully, we get more news soon as leaks and promotional material start rolling in.\nAvengers: Doomsday\nRelease date: December 18, 2026\nIf you thought we'd seen the last of the Avengers in Endgame, think again. We have to wait a while, though, until Avengers 5, now named Avengers: Doomsday, arrives. Details pertaining to the movie's plot and cast are pretty scarce right now. But during San Diego Comic-Con 2024, it was announced that the Russo brothers will be directing the project and that Robert Downey Jr has been cast as Doctor Doom. Originally, Avengers 5 was focused on the Marvel villain Kang the Conqueror. However, Marvel Studios has been reworking the project for some time now, away from the Loki villain.\nThis is due to the fact that Marvel dropped Kang actor Jonathan Majors from the role after the star was found guilty of reckless assault in the third degree and harassment in December 2023. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness writer Michael Waldron will pen the script. We also know that the Fantastic Four and Thunderbolts will appear in the upcoming film. It\u2019s all very exciting, and we can\u2019t wait to see how Marvel will set up Doctor Doom\u2019s appearance throughout Marvel Phase 6. Filming is now underway.\nAvengers: Secret Wars\nRelease date: December 17, 2027\nNot a lot has been confirmed about Avengers: Secret Wars just yet. However, Hulk actor Mark Ruffalo has teased that the movie will \"go out with a bang.\" In the comics, the Secret Wars saw Marvel's most powerful superheroes face off against the universe's most powerful villains, so whatever goes down is bound to be pretty explosive.\nNo major casting information has been announced yet, but the 2015 Secret Wars comic book storyline included Thor, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Captain America, She-Hulk, and the Fantastic Four. As for villains, we know that Doctor Doom will be the main bad guy, with Robert Downey Jr taking charge as the character. Like Avengers: Doomsday, the Russo brothers are also directing Secret Wars and have teased the inclusion of the Fantastic Four and the Thunderbolts in the upcoming flick.\nPotential Marvel Phase 6 movies and TV shows\nAnd that's not all. There are multiple undated or unknown projects coming as part of Marvel Phase 6 throughout the next few years.\nVision\nVision, a spin-off of WandaVision that's set to follow Paul Bettany's synthezoid hero, is slated to air on Disney Plus in 2026. Star Trek: Picard EP Terry Matalas will serve as showrunner. The new series will take place after the events of the WandaVision finale, and likely follow the all-white, rebuilt Vision as he finds a new purpose after being given a second chance at life.\nIn October 2024, Bettany told The Hollywood Reporter that they're \"cooking up something that I'm really excited about\" with Vision, before cutting himself off with a smile and \"snitches end up in ditches.\" Filming is set to kick off in 2025.\nWonder Man\nWonder Man is on its way to Disney Plus as a new miniseries under the 'Marvel Spotlight' banner, joining Echo as a street-level, character-driven project from the MCU. In the comics, Wonder Man is Simon Williams, the son of a failed Tony Stark-like industrialist who was once given superpowers by Baron Zemo. After eventually joining forces with the Avengers, Williams plied his trade in Hollywood as both an actor and stuntman.\nVariety suggests that Wonder Man will be a \"Hollywood satire.\" Sir Ben Kingsley will reprise his role as 'the toast of Croydon' Trevor Slattery for the Disney Plus series. Curiously, Nathan Fillion portrayed the character in a scene cut from Guardians of the Galaxy 2, but none other than Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is playing Wonder Man in this project. Shang-Chi director Destin Daniel Cretton and Hawkeye producer Andrew Guest are on board as showrunners, and filming on the 10-part series had wrapped as of April 2024 after disruptions caused by the SAG-AFTRA actors' strike. The series will release sometime in December 2025.\nShang-Chi 2\nA Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings sequel is officially in the works, with Simu Liu and director Destin Daniel Cretton both returning. Surprisingly, though, the film isn't part of Marvel's Phase 5 lineup. That means we won't be seeing the follow-up until Phase 6 at the earliest. Updates have been thin on the ground, but Liu promised fans that the long-awaited follow-up was still happening in August 2024.\nDoctor Strange 3\nDoctor Strange 3 hasn't been confirmed, but after Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' first post-credits scene showed Strange meeting Clea and heading through an interdimensional portal, we can assume we'll be seeing more from the sorcerer sooner rather than later. Strange is also all tied up with the multiverse, and since this stage of the MCU is named the Multiverse Saga, it would make sense for his third movie to fall within Phase 6.\nThor 5\nThor 5 hasn't been officially announced, but Thor: Love and Thunder certainly leaves the way open for a continuation. For one thing, there are those post-credits scenes that introduce Brett Goldstein's Hercules and reveal Idris Elba's Heimdall and Natalie Portman's Jane Foster are both in Valhalla. Then there's the introduction of Love, Gorr the God Butcher's daughter, now in the care of Thor. If a fivequel does materialize, then, it'll most likely be in Phase 6 of the MCU.\nX-Men\nThe mutant team is on its way to the MCU, though when it'll arrive is so far a complete mystery. Back in 2019, Kevin Feige hinted that we wouldn't be seeing the X-Men until 2025, which is coincidentally when Phase 6 is scheduled. We've already seen Patrick Stewart's Professor X in the MCU in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Wolverine return in Deadpool & Wolverine, so seeing the rest of the X-Men in Phase 6 doesn't seem like such a long shot.\nPlus, the MCU introduced mutants with Ms. Marvel, and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever's Namor is also a mutant, so it would seem the X-Men could well be on the horizon.\nBlack Panther 3\nFollowing Wakanda Forever, the story of the Black Panther is definitely left open for more with Shuri taking over the mantle and the introduction of T'Challa's son Toussaint. Letitia Wright has suggested that the movie might already be in development, too. \"I think it's already in the works,\" she told Variety in 2023. \"We just had a terrific two years of bringing [Wakanda Forever] out\u2026 we need a little bit of a break. We need to regroup [director Ryan Coogler] needs to get back in the lab. It's gonna take a while, but I'm really excited for you guys to see that.\"\nShe was more cautious in 2024, though. \"Let's just say, I would like to continue with Shuri,\" Wright teased on The View. \"She's one of my favorite characters. Such a blessing, honestly, I kid you not. I'm so grateful for her.\" When asked about Black Panther 3, Wright answered: \"There's a lot to, a lot to \u2013 a lot coming up.\" Nothing has been confirmed yet, but if Black Panther 3 is made, Marvel Phase 6 would be a surprise. But, then again, there are release slots to fill, and Black Panther is a pivotal character and franchise.\nOther potential sequels\nBeyond the above, there are also a few other potential projects that could form part of Phase 6 that have not been announced but could well happen. Moon Knight season 2 and Hawkeye season 2 are all potential contenders \u2013 though we'll just have to wait and see which of our hopes end up becoming reality.\nThe Blade movie (which was originally part of Marvel Phase 6) has also now been delayed indefinitely. However, that doesn't mean that it has been scrapped. There is still hope that we'll see it as part of Phase 6, so fingers crossed.\nCatch up on the MCU with our guide to watching the Marvel movies in order \u2013 and the good news is, almost everything is streaming on Disney Plus now.\nI'm the Deputy Entertainment Editor here at GamesRadar+, covering all things film and TV for the site's Total Film and SFX sections.

      "text": "Spider-Man: Brand New Day behind the scenes look may have spoiled the comic covers its director wants to recreate \u2013 which might be why it was swiftly deleted\nAre these Spider-Man: Brand New Day's surprise villains?\nA behind the scenes look at Spider-Man: Brand New Day showed off which comic covers its director Destin Daniel Cretton might recreate in the MCU sequel, as well as potentially revealing the unexpected villains that could face off against Tom Holland's wallcrawler.\nAs revealed by Cretton's assistant Ziyi Cao, a picture of a toy Spider-Man figure with the caption 'Hang in there' provided a glimpse at a couple of comic book covers that could be making their way onto the big screen in Spider-Man: Brand New Day. It has since been deleted, but fans were quick to grab screenshots of the Instagram post. See for yourself below.\nHere are the covers, maybe we get a villain fighting montage like in F4 to show what happened during the time jump from NWH or they are present for longer who knows \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/32w6nt4chtJuly 29, 2025\nThe covers in question are 1974's The Amazing Spider-Man #134 and 1991's The Amazing Spider-Man #345.\nIn the former, Spider-Man does battle with villain Tarantula, with The Punisher intervening. The other comic, meanwhile, sees the webslinger take on the obscure bad guy Boomerang, complete with \u2013 intriguingly \u2013 the re-emergence of Venom.\n\"He's got eight or nine comic covers up on his wall in his art department that he is bringing to life in this movie, which is super cool,\" Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige told Collider of Cretton's ongoing work on Spider-Man: Brand New Day, which is set to begin filming imminently.\nSpeaking of cameras rolling, one set detail on Spider-Man: Brand New Day appears to confirm that the fourth Spider-Man MCU movie will be set before the events of Avengers: Doomsday.\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day, starring Tom Holland, Zendaya, Jacob Batalon, Jon Bernthal, and Sadie Sink, is swinging into cinemas on July 31, 2026.\nDiscover what else is on the way with our guide to upcoming Marvel movies and Marvel Phase 6.\nI'm the Senior Entertainment Writer here at GamesRadar+, focusing on news, features, and interviews with some of the biggest names in film and TV.

      "text": "Upcoming Marvel movies and shows: Every new MCU release and more we know about\nHere are all the new Marvel movies and shows coming your way in 2025 and beyond\nIt's a good time to be a Marvel fan, not only is the MCU having a great year in terms of content, but there's still a boatload of upcoming Marvel movies and TV shows to look forward to. Marvel Phase 6 is now in full swing, with its first movie, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, now on the big screen, and new animated TV shows, Eyes of Wakanda, on Disney Plus \u2013 which has got us very excited for Black Panther 3.\nStill to come this year, we have What If...? spin-off Marvel Zombies, and comic book legend Wonder Man's small-screen debut. But the fun dosent stop in 2025, as next year, Spider-Man 4, which has just started filming in Scotland, will swing into cinemas, as well as Avengers: Doomsday. And that's only just scratching the surface.\nThe MCU slate may look a little too stacked to keep up with, but don't worry, as that's where we come in. Below, we've rounded up all the upcoming Marvel movies and shows, so you can save yourself a Thanos-sized task and get up to speed at a glance. If you're looking for a rundown on already released Marvel projects, check out our guide to the Marvel timeline, or how to watch the Marvel movies in order.\nMarvel Phase 6\nMarvel Phase 6: Every upcoming Marvel movie and show\nDid You think Phase 5 was the end of it? No way! Marvel has revealed multiple entries in Phase 6, as well as details the release dates of eight mystery projects. We've got all the confirmed dates here:\n- October 3, 2025: Marvel Zombies\n- December 2025: Wonder Man\n- July 24, 2026: Spider-Man 4\n- December 18, 2026: Avengers: Doomsday\n- December 17, 2027: Avengers: Secret Wars\n- February 18, 2028: Untitled movie\n- May 5, 2028: Untitled movie\n- November 10, 2028: Untitled movie\nMarvel Zombies\nMarvel Zombies release date: October 2025\nA What If...? spin-off, Marvel Zombies focuses on the undead creatures that inhabit the MCU. It's been confirmed that Ghost, Abomination, Captain Marvel, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, Okoye, Captain America, Kate Bishop, Yelena, Shang Chi, Ms. Marvel, and Jimmy Woo will all appear in the series while a half-dead Ikaris from Eternals will also show up. The show will also have a TV-MA rating, making this slightly more mature than What If...?. We got our first proper look at it in the Marvel TV trailer.\nWonder Man\nWonder Man release date: December 2025\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nDestin Daniel Cretton has a lot on his plate. As well as planning a Shang-Chi sequel, and a Spider-Man movie, the director executive produces the Wonder Man series too. Rather than write the series, however, Cretton will hand the reins to Andrew Guest, a writer and producer known for comedies Community and Brooklyn 99. We also know that Ben Kingsley will return as Trevor Slattery in the series. As for who is playing Wonder Man, it's none other than Aquaman star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. Wonder Man has a rich comic-book history: the character made his debut as a supervillain against the Avengers. After being defeated by Earth's Mightiest Heroes, he was revived multiple times and even joined the Avengers for a while.\nDaredevil: Born Again Season 2\nDaredevil: Born Again Season 2 release date: March 2026\nThe good news is that out of all the Marvel shows we are waiting details on, Daredevil: Born Again season 2 is the most developed by far. Filming for the series began in March 2025 and looks to be aiming for a 2026 release. Marvel TV head Brad Winderbaum also recently told Screen Rant that season 2 will come out \"next year\". So, yeah, it seems like Daredevil fans are in for an annual kind of deal going forward. We are still waiting on a firm release date, though, and it's unclear if we'll see our hero feature in any Marvel Phase 6 movies. We'll keep you posted as we wait for more details. But for now, at least we can rest easy knowing that the Disney Plus series hasn't been cancelled and will be back soon.\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day release date: July 31, 2026\nAfter rumblings that it was happening, and that the script was in a good place, it's now been confirmed when Spider-Man will be swinging back onto our screens with Spider-Man 4, officially titled Spider-Man: Brand New Day. Tom Holland's friendly neighborhood superhero will be returning in July 2026, and Shang-Chi director Destin Daniel Cretton is officially on board to direct. It's not yet clear who else, aside from Holland, is down to return, but he'll be joined by Stranger Things star Sadie Sink in an undisclosed role. Holland announced that production has started on the fourth installment, and filming will start in summer 2025. But, with Zendaya still not attached to the project, fans seem to think that we may have seen the last of MJ, and Peter Parker may have a new love interest in number 4. Could Gwen Stacey or Marvel comic character Black Cat be up next?\nAvengers: Doomsday\nAvengers: Doomsday release date: December 18, 2026\nAvengers 5, now titled Avengers: Doomsday, is set to be directed by the Russo brothers and will see Robert Downey Jr\u2019s return to the MCU. However, he isn\u2019t Tony Stark this time around. No, instead, Downey Jr will be playing Doctor Doom. Originally, Avengers 5 was titled Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, and it would've been directed by Shang-Chi's Destin Daniel Cretton. Jonathan Majors would have starred as the titular, multiverse-conquering villain. However, Majors was dropped by Marvel Studios on December 18, 2023.\nThat means that Kang is being put on the back burner, and Doctor Doom will take his place as the big bad of the MCU going forward. Joe Russo gave us a scoop on the upcoming return, too, telling us that they have an idea to rival Endgame and Infinity War. Interesting... In terms of cast, we know that Anthony Mackie will be back as Captain America, along with a massive list of other Marvel stars, including Sebastian Stan, Patrick Stewart, Letitia Wright, and many, many more.\nAvengers: Secret Wars\nAvengers: Secret Wars release date: December 17, 2027\nThe big one. Avengers: Secret Wars comes loaded with expectations. There have been two major comic book stories titled Secret Wars, the first of which saw heroes and villains transported to the planet Battleworld by the Beyonder to fight each other. The second, which launched in 2015, saw two universes collide \u2013 the main Marvel universe and the Ultimate universe \u2013 as an incursion threatened to wipe them both out, with Doctor Doom playing a major role.\nConsidering Doctor Strange 2 introduced incursions, and this is the Multiverse Saga, the second seems to be the inspiration for the movie. The film was originally set for release a few months after Avengers 5, but both have been delayed since. They're now set to release a year apart in December 2026 and 2027.\nTBC Marvel movies and shows\nOther Marvel movies and shows not in Phases\nNow comes the fun part \u2013 speculating over what's to come next. While there's been no official confirmation that these projects will form parts of Phases 5 or 6 or any Phase, industry reports and various insiders claim these upcoming Marvel movies and shows are on the way, we just don't know when.\nAlso to note: although Eternals, Doctor Strange 2, and Thor: Love and Thunder, all end with cards saying their heroes will return, we've not included individual upcoming superhero movies below as there has been no confirmation that sequels are happening (though you can read more on a potential Thor 5 if you wish).\nThere is also a mystery movie added to the 2028 schedule, for December 15. We've left that off the list below for now, since we have no details at all on what it might be \u2013 though everyone is convinced it's either X-Men, Blade, or even a Secret Wars Part 2...\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man season 2\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man season 2 release date: TBC\nBefore the first season even hit our screens, this Marvel show was already renewed for not only season 2, but a third instalment as well. Clearly, Disney Plus had a lot of faith that it would be a hit. And production is already well underway on Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man season 2, with Marvel Studios Head of Streaming, Television, and Animation, Brad Winderbaum, telling The Movie Podcast early in 2025 that all the scripts were complete and half of the work on the animatics was done too.\nSo, whilst no release date has been officially revealed, with this significant process, we anticipate that it will swing onto the streaming service in early 2026, following in the footsteps of the first season, which hit the small screen in January 2025. Here at GamesRadar+, we loved season one, awarding it a shiny four stars in our Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man review, so consider us already seated.\nArmor Wars\nArmor Wars release date: TBC\nAfter the Don Cheadle-led project was absent from San Diego Comic-Con, many speculated that the series had been scrapped by Marvel. The project was officially re-announced at D23, with Cheadle in attendance, and is set to pick up following the events of Secret Invasion.\nOriginally a Disney Plus series, but now a movie, the film will see Cheadle's War Machine dealing with \"what happens when Tony Stark's tech falls into the wrong hands.\" The latest update was not promising either, suggesting it's not happening any time soon.\nBlack Panther 3\nBlack Panther release date: TBC\nWell, it's happening. After much fan speculation and swirling rumors, it looks like the third installment of Black Panther is on the way. Although not much has been revealed about the upcoming movie at the moment, we do know that Denzel Washington will star, and director Ryan Coogler is thinking up a part for him.\nThis marks a beautiful full-circle moment as Washington actually quietly funded a summer of acting lessons for the late Chadwick Boseman when he was starting out. Keep your eyes peeled for more Black Panther 3 news.\nBlade\nBlade release date: TBC\nBlade has been a long time coming and was initially meant to be a Marvel Phase 5 title before it was pushed back to Marvel Phase 6 and then later taken off the schedule completely. It's not looking too good for the project now, either \u2013 Delroy Lindo, who was previously attached to star, implied that he was no longer attached and said the movie had \"gone off the rails.\"\nKevin Feige announced that Mahershala Ali would play the role back in 2019, with the actor having a minor voice role in the Eternals post-credits. Unfortunately, director Bassim Tariq stepped down from helming the movie shortly before filming was set to begin. A new script was reportedly being written by Michael Starrbury. True Detective's Nic Pizzolatto then joined as a writer, and horror queen Mia Goth has joined the cast, too. Sadly, the future still seems uncertain for Blade, as no new release date has been announced yet. Stay tuned for more details.\nShang-Chi 2\nShang-Chi 2 release date: TBC\nConsidering the success of Shang-Chi, and the post-credits sting that teased the character's return, a sequel seemed inevitable. Reports signaled that Destin Daniel Cretton had signed a multi-year deal with Marvel to develop projects including a sequel to Shang-Chi.\nWhether Cretton will direct the follow-up remains to be seen. What is definite, though, is that Shang-Chi 2 is coming, and will probably be part of Phase 6. And don't be too shocked to see a Ten Rings series at some stage, either.\nWakanda spin-off\nWakanda release date: TBC\nReports previously signaled that Ryan Coogler, who has signed an overall deal with Marvel, is developing a new Disney Plus series that will tell stories from Wakanda. That's what has been confirmed. Separate reports also indicated that an Okoye spin-off starring Danai Gurira, telling the origins of the Dora Milaje leader, was in development.\n\"Because of the amount of time and attention that went into [Black Panther: Wakanda Forever], and frankly the Ironheart show, that is probably not as far along as people want it to be,\" Black Panther 2 producer Nate Moore told Collider of the Wakanda spin-off. \"But there are certainly great ideas that we're still talking to Ryan about. So, we'll see how far we can get with it.\" In February 2025, it was confirmed that the Okoye spin-off is no longer happening.\nNova\nNova release date: TBC\nNova has been one of the most-requested heroes for some time, and a new project looks set to bring him into the MCU. Moon Knight scribe Sabir Pirzada is on board to write the project, though it remains unclear whether this will be a movie or a Disney Plus series. In the comics, Nova's origin story revolves around a planet that we have seen before in live-action: Guardians of the Galaxy\u2019s Xandar, which was almost destroyed by the villain Ronan.\nNova \u2013 real name Richard Rider \u2013 was a member of the Xandar Corps and is bestowed the power of Nova Prime. He must come to terms with his newfound powers. There's no casting or director just yet, but don't be surprised to see Nova as part of Phase 6.\nStar-Lord movie or TV show\nStar-Lord movie/show release date: TBC\nWhile the third Guardians of the Galaxy movie marks the end of the trilogy, it seems one character may still be coming back. In the Guardians of the Galaxy 3 post-credits scene, a title card appeared saying that Chris Pratt's Legendary Star-Lord will return. Speaking to GamesRadar+, Pratt shared that it would have to be a very special project for him to return to the role without James Gunn.\n\"It would be strange to continue Peter\u2019s story without James,\" Pratt told us. \"He's done such a masterful job in the first three films. We really found the voice of Peter Quill together and without him, obviously, I would never have had this opportunity.\"\nVision\nVision release date: 2026\nFive years after 'White' Vision flew off to deal with an existential crisis after having his memories restored in WandaVision, Paul Bettany will return as the character in a Disney Plus show helmed by Star Trek: Picard's Terry Matalas. The good news is that the writers' room for the upcoming Marvel show opened in May 2024, so at least we know that development is happening here. Casting has been slowly coming through as well, with an unexpected Iron Man star joining.\nX-Men movie\nX-Men release date: TBC\nLittle is known at this early stage about the upcoming X-Men movie. In fact, it could be several years off - but work has begun on the project. Hunger Games: The Ballad Of Songbirds & Snakes writer Michael Lesslie is in discussions to pen the script, per Deadline.\nThere's been no casting yet, but we can expect a completely fresh cast of mutants. Several teases have already been sprinkled throughout the MCU (Ms. Marvel's mutant origins, a Wolverine Easter egg in She-Hulk, and Logan's return in Deadpool), enough to suggest that mutants could easily fold into the cinematic universe without too much of an issue. After the release of Captain America: Brave New World, producer Nate Moore said plans were ongoing but \"fluid\".\nThose are all the upcoming Marvel movies and shows we know about.

      "text": "Spider-Man 4 release date, cast, leaks and theories, and everything else we know about the Marvel movie\nSpider-Man: Brave New Day is the next Marvel movie to hit the big screen\nAfter the release of The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Spider-Man 4 is now the next Marvel movie to hit the big screen, but we've still got a pretty long time to wait until Peter Parker returns to the multiplex.\nThere isn't much in the way of official information out there just yet, other than the fact that the movie is called Spider-Man: Brand New Day, and some new (and familiar) faces are joining Tom Holland for his fourth outing as the web-slinger \u2013 including Jon Bernthal's Punisher. Filming looks set to start in the very near future, however, and set photos are already providing us with some intriguing hints about what to expect in the run-up to Avengers: Doomsday.\nSpider-Man 4 is one of the most exciting upcoming Marvel movies on the way, which is why we've compiled everything you need to know about it right here, from the release date to a list of confirmed cast members and which comic book plot lines might be relevant to the movie's plot.\nSpider-Man 4 release date\nThe Spider-Man 4 release date is July 31, 2026, with the movie releasing as part of Marvel Phase 6.\nIt was originally slated for July 24 before it was pushed back a week, possibly to avoid clashing with Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey, which also stars Tom Holland and is due to be released on July 17. Filming is set to kick off sometime this summer \u2013 in other words, very, very soon.\nIs there a Spider-Man 4 trailer?\nNo, there isn't a Spider-Man 4 trailer at the moment as filming on the movie hasn't kicked off just yet.\nBased on the next two big-screen Marvel outings, we can expect a trailer in January or February 2026, as the first trailer for Thunderbolts* dropped six months ahead of its release date, and the Fantastic Four: First Steps trailer was released five months before its release date. Whenever a trailer does drop, we'll be the first to let you know.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nSpider-Man 4 cast\nTom Holland and Stranger Things star Sadie Sink were the first confirmed cast members for Spider-Man 4, with Sink's role is still being kept under wraps (although fans think she might be playing Jean Grey). Zendaya will be back as MJ Watson and Jacob Batalon is returning as Ned, but it's unclear what kind of role they would play, as they won't know who Peter is after the events of No Way Home.\nJon Bernthal's Punisher is also joining Spider-Man: Brand New Day, making his big-screen debut after returning for a couple of episodes in Daredevil: Born Again. Frank Castle first appeared in the Netflix TV series Daredevil and later starred in his own show, The Punisher.\nAs for new characters, Sony boss Amy Pascal teased that \"there\u2019s a lot of fantastic female characters\" in the movie, so it looks like we can expect some fresh faces to join the cast. As for who that could be, you'll have to stay tuned.\nBelow is the list of the confirmed Spider-Man 4 cast so far:\n- Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man\n- Sadie Sink\n- Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle/The Punisher\n- Zendaya as MJ Watson\n- Jacob Batalon as Ned\nSpider-Man 4 plot speculation\nThere are no official Spider-Man 4 plot details out there at the moment, but we do know that the movie is titled Spider-Man: Brand New Day. During an appearance at CinemaCon in Las Vegas in late March 2025, Tom Holland teased the new movie saying: \"I know we left you with a massive cliffhanger at the end of No Way Home, so Spider-Man: Brand New Day is a fresh start. It is exactly that. That's all I can say.\"\nSpider-Man: No Way Home ended with Peter realizing that the only way to protect the sanctity of the multiverse is to erase himself from everyone's memories, including his loved ones. Before Doctor Strange casts the spell to wipe all traces of Peter Parker from the world, he promises MJ and Ned that he'll find them and help them remember him, so we'll see if he follows through on that vow. After speaking to Happy, Peter decides not to hang up his Spidey suit for good, so we can expect plenty of web-slinging action.\nThe confirmation of the film's official title might have offered some clues, though: it's a direct reference to a divisive comic book storyline that ran in 2008 and was essentially a soft reboot for Peter Parker. In the story, he agreed to Mephisto's terms to sacrifice his marriage to Mary-Jane in order to save the life of his Aunt May. We don't know if this storyline will be important for the upcoming movie, but it could fit well with the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home. Especially since Mephisto just made his MCU debut in Ironheart...\nAnother clue could be found in the casting of Sadie Sink. If the rumors are true and she is playing Jean Grey (or Firestar\u2026), then we can expect some sort of crossover between Spider-Man and the X-Men, too. Kevin Feige previously said that the X-Men would be an \"important part\" of the MCU's future after Avengers: Secret Wars arrives in 2027, so it would make sense to lay the groundwork for that in the movies directly preceding Secret Wars.\nOn the flip side, the movie might go in the opposite direction, and avoid all the big cosmic stuff altogether. \"I think there's a promise at the end of No Way Home that, for as sad as it is, that Peter is forgotten by everyone in his life. We are seeing for the first time in the Tom Holland Spider-Man stories, him being a proper Spider-Man. Him being, by himself, dedicated to saving the city, and dealing with \u2013 for lack of a better term \u2013 street level crime as opposed to world-ending events that he faced when working with the other characters,\" Feige recently told GamesRadar+ and other outlets.\nOne thing that seems a little more set in stone, however, is Brand New Day's place on the Marvel timeline. Set photos recently revealed signage for an in-universe construction project, which is due to finish in December 2027. That puts the events of the movie around the same time as Thunderbolts*, which takes place in late 2027.\nFor more, check out our guide to all the other upcoming superhero movies on the way from Marvel and DC.

      "text": "That has to sting. It\u2019s been eight years since Michael Mando\u2018s Mac Gargan was set up to become Spider-Man villain the Scorpion in 2017\u2019s Homecoming, which saw the friendly neighborhood wallcrawler (Tom Holland) ground Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) and two Shockers (Logan Marshall-Green and Bokeem Woodbine), all while dealing with low-level crooks like the Tinkerer (Michael Chernus) and Aaron Davis/the Prowler (Donald Glover). With a total of six supervillains set up in Homecoming, one is finally getting their \u201ctail\u201d told in Spider-Man: Brand New Day.\nVideos by ComicBook.com\nMando has already confirmed that he\u2019ll be suiting up as the Scorpion in the new movie, previously taking to Instagram to post a selfie of Gargan\u2019s scorpion neck tattoo. Now the Better Call Saul star has shared a sneak peek of himself in the makeup chair as Gargan\u2019s mangled look \u2014 the result of his run-in with the Staten Island Ferry \u2014 is created through prosthetics makeup effects:\nMando also offered this stinger of a teaser: artist Kevin Maguire\u2019s variant cover for 2008\u2019s Amazing Spider-Man #573, below, which shows Gargan\u2019s Scorpion being overtaken by the Venom symbiote.\nPart of the six-part \u201cNew Ways to Die\u201d storyline from the Brand New Day-era comics, the arc saw Norman Osborn \u2014 the Green Goblin and the head of a Thunderbolts team that included Gargan\u2019s Venom, Songbird, Radioactive Man, and Bullseye \u2014 transform Gargan into the brand new Scorpion. Gargan\u2019s Venomized Scorpion fought the symbiote\u2019s former hosts, Spider-Man and Eddie Brock, who had become Anti-Venom after feeling the touch of Martin Li (aka the dark-sided villain Mr. Negative).\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Mando has suggested Gargan might don the Venom symbiote as his comic counterpart did back in 2005\u2019s Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #10. The actor has previously shared comic book art of Gargan in both his identities as Scorpion and Venom, hinting he could be the new symbiote host in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nRemember, the mid-credits scene of 2021\u2019s Spider-Man: No Way Home revealed that Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) left behind a trace of the alien symbiote in the MCU when the spell cast by Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) transported him back to his own reality. Now that the Hardy-fronted Venom trilogy has concluded with 2024\u2019s The Last Dance, maybe it\u2019s a brand new day for the symbiote as well?\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day \u2014 starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle/the Punisher, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, the Hulk, Zendaya as MJ, Jacob Batalon as Ned, Michael Mando as Mac Gargan/Scorpion, with Sadie Sink and Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas in undisclosed roles \u2014 is slated to open in theaters July 31, 2026."
