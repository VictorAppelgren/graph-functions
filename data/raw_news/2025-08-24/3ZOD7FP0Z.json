  "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 There was bedlam at the U.S. Open Sunday night, when Daniil Medvedev\u2019s match against Benjamin Bonzi was delayed for six minutes after a photographer prematurely entered the court.\n\nFrance\u2019s Bonzi was up match point against former world No. 1 and U.S. Open champion Medvedev on Louis Armstrong Stadium, leading 6-3, 7-5, 5-4, when he missed a first serve. At this point, a photographer walked onto the court thinking the match was about to finish. Because of the delay caused by him coming onto the court, umpire Greg Allensworth ruled that Bonzi should have a first serve back, rather than having to hit a second serve.\n\nMedvedev, always a volatile player who knows how to work a crowd, berated Allensworth and demanded the crowd to make some noise and show their displeasure.\n\nAfter claiming that Allensworth \u201cwanted to leave\u201d because he gets \u201cpaid by the match, not by the hour,\u201d he shouted toward the camera: \u201cReilly Opelka was right!\u201d This was in apparent reference to the American player saying in February that: \u201cThe guy (Allensworth) shouldn\u2019t have a job or should be sidelined for about four weeks, maybe learn a thing or two,\u201d after he penalized Opelka for swearing at a spectator at the Dallas Open.\n\nWith the noise deafening, Bonzi waited before serving. Amid chants of \u201csecond serve,\u201d Allensworth tried and failed to quieten the crowd, with Bonzi asking why Medvedev did not receive a time violation for inciting the commotion.\n\nEventually, after a six-minute delay, Bonzi did serve, missing it, before sending a backhand into the net after a nervy second serve. Medvedev won the next two points and broke to rescue the match, sending the crowd into a frenzy. He then claimed the set in a tiebreak, resurrected after the most unlikely of delays.",
