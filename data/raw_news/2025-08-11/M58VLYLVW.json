  "title": "The past five years for Eduspec Holdings Berhad (KLSE:EDUSPEC) investors has not been profitable",
  "description": "KLSE:EDUSPEC 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore Eduspec Holdings Berhad's Fair Values from the Community and...",
  "content": "Explore Eduspec Holdings Berhad's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\n\n\nEduspec Holdings Berhad (KLSE:EDUSPEC) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 12% in the last month. But if you look at the last five years the returns have not been good. In fact, the share price is down 77%, which falls well short of the return you could get by buying an index fund.\n\nSo let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nEduspec Holdings Berhad wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally hope to see good revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.\n\nOver five years, Eduspec Holdings Berhad grew its revenue at 32% per year. That's well above most other pre-profit companies. So it's not at all clear to us why the share price sunk 12% throughout that time. You'd have to assume the market is worried that profits won't come soon enough. While there might be an opportunity here, you'd want to take a close look at the balance sheet strength.\n\nThe image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nIf you are thinking of buying or selling Eduspec Holdings Berhad stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.\n\nWhat About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?\n\nInvestors should note that there's a difference between Eduspec Holdings Berhad's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price change, which we've covered above. The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. Eduspec Holdings Berhad hasn't been paying dividends, but its TSR of -6.7% exceeds its share price return of -77%, implying it has either spun-off a business, or raised capital at a discount; thereby providing additional value to shareholders.\n\nIt's nice to see that Eduspec Holdings Berhad shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 7.7% over the last year. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 1.3% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. We generally put more weight on the long term performance over the short term, but the recent improvement could hint at a (positive) inflection point within the business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Eduspec Holdings Berhad better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with Eduspec Holdings Berhad , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.",

  "argos_summary": "Eduspec Holdings Berhad's share price has increased by 12% over the last month, but it has seen a significant decline of 77% over the past five years. Despite growing its revenue at an impressive rate of 32% per year during that time, the company has not turned a profit, leading to concerns about its sustainability. The total shareholder return (TSR) of -6.7% indicates that while the share price has dropped, there may have been some value added through capital raises or spin-offs.",
