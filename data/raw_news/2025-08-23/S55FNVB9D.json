  "description": "I'll have fresh herbs and edible flowers year-round thanks to this counter-top hydroponic garden.",
  "content": "Every spring in my childhood, there was a full weekend where all my siblings and me would spend every waking minute preparing the garden for the summer growing season. There was dirt under fingernails, on clothes, and it seemed like no amount of scrubbing could get it off our knees at the end of each day. It was almost as much fun as the fall day six months later when we'd prepare the same plot of land that provided us with fresh fruit, vegetables, and herbs for a winter under snow and ice in southwestern Connecticut.\n\nI yearned for the garden, apparently, because I spent my summers between college semesters working on an organic farm in Tennessee. However, that itch to get dirt on my hands and harvest the fruits of my labor has gone unscratched since I moved to the city. Living half a dozen floors above ground with very little ledge or balcony space doesn't lend itself well to a gardener.\n\nLuckily, I found that I didn't need a plot of land or even a window box to satisfy my green thumb urge. Here's my secret to feeling like a farm-to-table chef -- without leaving my apartment.\n\nHydroponic gardening is the process used to grow plants without soil. Rather, the plants are sustained on water-based nutrients derived from a tank of water that their roots are suspended in. There's typically a pump within the system that allows oxygen and the nutrient-rich water to reach the plants directly, just as they'd typically pull it out of the soil in a regular growing situation.\n\nPlants in a hydroponic system typically grow faster with less mess, as there's no dirt you're dealing with. In a small apartment space like mine, that makes a huge difference. I have a few houseplants that are in real soil, and every time I have to repot them, I feel like I'm vacuuming up the mess for weeks and weeks after. And while there's a meditation to walking around and watering each one of them the manual way, there's always a sense of guilt I have leaving to travel and coming back to see my peace lily shriveled up and wilted from lack of attention.\n\nThere's nothing more irritating than buying a bundle of fresh mint for cocktails at the store for upwards of $3. My family's backyard is completely overgrown with peppermint, so we started drinking Hugo Spritzes and Mojitos in the summertime to combat the invasion -- at least that's what we told ourselves.\n\nNow, paying money out of my pocket for an herb like that feels ridiculous. I'd love to have peppermint in a controlled capacity, as well as all my other favorite herbs on hand 24/7 -- but I simply don't have the space in my apartment for a dozen or so pots and planters to accommodate them all.\n\nBut, a hydroponic growing system solves that exact issue: it has small designated spots for almost any herb or flower that you want, all organized neatly next to the cutting board. No soil, no mess. Plus, because they're intended for indoor use, your herbs and flowers aren't bound by their natural growing seasons. My sister has a hydroponic tomato plant that's been producing the most delicious cherry tomatoes for over two years -- straight.\n\nAfter seeing her success, I wanted in on the hydroponic action. That's where LetPot came in -- it had caught my eye in various publications over the years, and when I had the chance to try its 12-Pod Hydroponic Growing System, I jumped at the opportunity.\n\nWhat I like about LetPot's 12-Pod Hydroponic Growing System\n\nIt's perfect on my counter\n\nMy first impression of this LetPot device was that the size was absolutely perfect. Just over 17 inches wide, it fits against the wall on my kitchen counter like it was built for the space itself. The LED light panel, which provides two different settings for vegetables and herbs versus flowers, can be raised to make the height of the device reach up to 30-inches, but even at full extension, it didn't feel overwhelmingly tall for my kitchen.\n\nWhat makes LetPot's model stand out is the accompanying app. Not only is the interface clean, but it's incredibly simple and intuitive. In it, you can name your device (which is handy if you have multiple), set water pump and lighting schedules, adjust the brightness of the light panel, and even count how many days it's been since you started a particular round of growing. You can also remotely turn it on and off.\n\nI do have to say, though, my favorite part of LetPot's system is how quiet the pump is. When I first set it up, it was so quiet that I couldn't hear it even when I put my ear up against the metal siding. I was worried that it was broken, so I lifted up the growing tray and was shocked to see the little pump moving the water around already. It really was just that quiet.\n\nSpeaking of siding, I really enjoy the sleek stainless steel body. It's clean and neutral in my kitchen, and I can't wait to see how the plants look in contrast. As of writing, I have planted lavender, peppermint, basil, sage, and several baskets of edible nasturium flowers for a pop of color.\n\nWhat I didn't like about LetPot's 12-Pod Hydroponic Growing System\n\nI wouldn't call myself the most patient person in the world, but sometimes instructions meet me on a bad day. When the device first arrived, I laid out all the components and got to reading the manual. There's a lot involved in the initial set-up, including a learning curve for learning and mixing nutrient ratios for the water tank beneath the plants. However, I want to front up this qualm with that since the setup is over, I can already tell maintenance and further use are going to be a piece of cake -- maybe even with some of my edible nasturium flowers adorning it.\n\nMy next qualm also has to do with the hardware. We know that plants need four things to grow: nutrients, water, air, and light. I've personally banned all cool-toned LED and fluorescent lighting in my house, and the LetPot's light panel is genuinely the only exception I'll make. There is a 'low' brightness mode, but in a dark room, it's still pretty stark. However, there's no battling this personal gripe -- it's either the light on 'low,' or no gardening at all.\n\nFinally, the beep that pierced my ears upon powering up the garden system was a shock in my quiet apartment -- I do wish there was a way to turn it down so I don't wake up my whole floor just to reconnect it to the Wi-Fi. It also produces the beep if you turn it on or off from the app, which I guess is useful if you aren't in the same room to check if the light goes out or not. Either way, I wish it was a little quieter.\n\nIf you're in a small space, yes\n\nLetPot's systems are perfect if you live in an urban setting with limited access to soil, or even if you're just short on space like me. Indoor gardeners can also reap the benefits, and people who like to cook with fresh herbs will definitely see the grocery bill go down when they start picking their own rosemary from their kitchen counter.\n\nAfter reading the instructions a few times, I'm confident that anyone can use this garden system to grow fresh herbs in their kitchen -- no soil required.\n\nThis device was provided to Pocket-lint by LetPot.

      "text": "Summary\n- Regularly clearing up the Recycle Bin and app cache can free up surprising amounts of space.\n- Moving old media to the cloud helps save space without losing your important files.\n- Unused apps and background downloads often take up more storage than you think.\nWhile most Android flagships now come with a minimum of 256GB of internal storage, I still somehow end up running out of space occasionally. If you've been using your Samsung phone for a while, chances are you've also encountered the dreaded \"storage almost full\" notification.\nI've encountered this more times than I can count, especially since most Samsung Galaxy flagships no longer include a microSD card slot. But over the years, I've found a few tricks that help me free up space on my phone without deleting anything important.\nIf you frequently run into storage issues, but don't want to lose important files in the process, here are a few ways you can make space on your smartphone without sacrificing anything valuable.\n5 Android apps I delete immediately from every new phone\nI hate clutter almost as much as I hate superfluous apps -- here are the defaults that I always delete when setting up a new Pixel phone.\n6 Empty the recycle bin first\nYou'd be surprised how much it stores\nOne of the easiest ways to reclaim storage space on your Galaxy phone is by emptying the Recycle Bin. You'd be surprised how much junk your phone holds onto even after you've deleted it.\nMost of Samsung's first-party apps, like Gallery and My Files, don't delete files right away. Instead, they move deleted files to the Recycle Bin, where they're stored for 30 days. While this is helpful in case you want to recover something you deleted by mistake, it also means large videos and files you thought were gone are still taking up space.\nTo remove all deleted files from the Recycle Bin, go to Settings > Device Care > Storage > Recycle Bin. Here, you'll see all the data that you've deleted, but hasn't been permanently removed from your phone yet.\nCheck if there's anything you want to recover. If not, select the app (like Gallery or My Files) that contains the trashed items, tap the three-dot menu, and choose Empty. You don't have to do this every day, but turning it into a monthly habit can help keep your storage cleaner than you'd expect.\nThis is how I optimize my Galaxy phone to improve performance\nSamsung phones work great out of the box but can get sluggish over time. Here's how to optimize Galaxy phones to boost performance.\n5 Get rid of the duplicate files\nThey're just wasting space for no reason\nThe next best way to free up storage on your phone is by removing duplicate files that may have accumulated over time. You might have the same file saved twice, multiple versions of screenshots, or duplicate media from messaging apps like WhatsApp or Telegram.\nThese files take up unnecessary space, and since they contain the same data, deleting them is a great way to clear storage while keeping at least one copy intact.\nTo find and delete duplicate files on your phone, go to Settings > Device Care > Storage > Duplicate files. Here, you'll see a list of files that are essentially duplicates. You can choose which versions to delete while keeping one copy. Once selected, tap Delete.\nKeep in mind that these files go to the Recycle Bin, so to permanently free up space, head back to the Recycle Bin (as mentioned earlier) and empty it to remove the files for good.\n6 overlooked Samsung Galaxy settings that can upgrade your user experience\nIt's worthwhile to try these six settings on your Samsung Galaxy device.\n4 Uninstall the apps you never use\nIf you haven't opened it in months, ditch it\nIf you've been using your Samsung Galaxy smartphone for a long time \u2014 like I have with my Galaxy S23 since mid-2023 \u2014 you've probably accumulated a lot of apps, many of which you rarely (or never) use. These unused apps can quietly take up hundreds of MBs or even several GBs of storage while doing absolutely nothing.\nIf you haven't opened an app in the past few months, it's likely safe to uninstall it. Samsung makes this easy by showing you a list of unused apps by going to Settings > Device care > Storage > Unused apps.\nIt's a great way to identify what can be removed without having to dig through your app drawer manually. I recently freed up more than 2.5GB on my phone using this feature, without even realizing those apps were taking up so much space. And if you ever need them again, you can always reinstall later.\nI solved One UI 8's most annoying issue with one quick tweak\nOne UI 8 is almost perfect out of the box, except for this one setting.\n3 Wipe out app caches and all the temporary files\nThese build up fast and serve no real purpose\nNow that you've removed the apps you don't use often, the next step is to clear the cache from the apps you do use regularly. Cache is generally a good thing, as it helps apps load faster, but over time, that \"temporary\" data builds up and can take up a significant chunk of your phone's storage. Apps like Google Chrome, Spotify, X (Twitter), and YouTube are common culprits that build up a lot of cache over time.\nUnfortunately, One UI doesn't offer an easy, all-in-one way to delete app cache like it does for removing duplicates or large files. But there is one way you can easily manage app cache on your Galaxy device.\nGo to Settings > Apps, then tap the Sort button and choose Size. This will show you which apps are using the most storage. Tap on each app, go into Storage, and then tap Clear cache.\nMake sure you don't tap \"Clear data\" unless you want to reset the app entirely.\nI used One UI 7 on my Samsung Galaxy, and these 5 features impressed me the most\nI didn't expect these One UI 7 features to impress me this much\n2 Move old photos and videos to the cloud\nKeep your memories without hogging storage\nPhotos and videos are often the biggest space hogs on any phone. But since these are your precious memories, you don't necessarily have to delete them to free up space.\nThe easiest way to reclaim storage is by moving these files elsewhere -- somewhere you can still access them easily. Yes, this might mean an extra cost, but it keeps your memories safe and your phone's storage under control.\nYou can use the pre-installed Google Photos app on your Samsung phone to back up your photos and videos. The built-in Samsung Gallery app also offers OneDrive integration.\nBoth services provide up to 15GB of free storage, and if that's not enough, you can upgrade. For example, Microsoft's basic paid plan offers 100GB of cloud storage for just $2/month.\n1 Clean up downloaded media from apps\nStreaming apps often save files quietly\nAnother thing you should keep an eye on is how much storage space your streaming apps, like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube, are using. If you download movies or shows for offline viewing (like before a flight), these files can quietly take up a lot of space.\nMany of these apps also have features like Smart Downloads that automatically download content for later, which can further fill up your storage unnecessarily.\nIt's a good idea to regularly check and clear downloaded media from these apps when it's no longer needed. While you're at it, consider turning off automatic downloads, so these apps don't keep downloading new content without you realizing it.\nHow to get 15GB of Gmail storage completely for free\nYou'll get to keep your existing email address, but there are a few hoops to jump through.\nAll in all, freeing up storage on your Samsung phone doesn't have to mean deleting the things you care about. With these methods, you can easily reclaim a surprising amount of space and keep your phone running like new.\nGalaxy S25 Ultra\n- SoC\n- Snapdragon 8 Elite\n- Display\n- 6.9-inch\n- RAM\n- 12GB\n- Storage\n- 256GB, 512GB, 1TB\n- Battery\n- 5,000mAh\n- Rear camera\n- f/1.7 200-megapixel wide, f/1.9 50-megapixel ultra-wide, f/2.4 10 megapixel 3x telephoto, f/3.4 50-megapixel 5x telephoto\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is the most refined flagship from the brand yet.

      "text": "Summary\n- A novel take on the external power bank has hit the crowdsourcing scene in the form of MagInk on Kickstarter.\n- MagInk offers a customizable E-ink display, fast wired charging, and magnetic inductive charging.\n- The power bank features a slim design, with a 5,000mAh total battery capacity.\nA novel new Kickstarter campaign has hit the internet, and it's called MagInk. As first spotted by Good e-Reader, a Hong Kong-based product development team called Tmobi has crafted up the idea to outfit a 5,000mAh external battery bank with a dedicated color E Ink display panel.\nMagInk features a slim and lightweight design, and it offers 22.5W of wired charging, in addition to 15W of wireless magnetic charging. It's unclear whether the device is MagSafe or Qi2 certified, but I reckon the latter is more likely. The product is showcased in black, slate, and white colorways, with an aluminum or a PC + ABS shell based on variant, in addition to NFC, Bluetooth app control, and support for both Apple Find My and Google Find Hub.\n...the star of the show is undoubtedly the 4-color E-Ink screen located on the rear of MagInk.\nOf course, the star of the show is undoubtedly the 4-color E-Ink display located on the rear of MagInk, which can be programmed to display any number of images on screen via a dedicated companion app. User-uploaded photos are supported, in addition to AI-generated artwork. These images are then wirelessly cast directly to the MagInk unit via your smartphone.\n\"MagInk is the world\u2019s first smart power bank that combines a color E-Ink display, AI-powered customization, and productivity tools\u2014all in one,\" says Tmobi in its campaign notes.\nAt the time of writing, the MagInk Kickstarter campaign has a total of 61 backers, with 28 days remaining for project backing. $5,134 has been pledged, which already exceeds the $5,000 goal set by the Tmobi team.\nMagInk: Smart E-Ink Power Bank with AI Customizable Display\nMagInk is an external 5,000mAh battery bank with a slim design, Apple Find My and Google Find Hub support, 15W magnetic wireless and 22.5W wired charging, and, most notably, a reprogrammable color E Ink display.\nThis $70 power bank just ensured I'll never buy an Apple MagSafe Battery Pack\nOnePlus' new Slim Magnetic Power Bank 5000mAh is so good, that I've lost interest in a next-generation MagSafe Battery Pack from Apple.\nAn ingenious idea that I can get behind\nI can't believe nobody else has thought to outfit a power bank with E Ink\nInternet-based crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter have exploded in popularity in recent years, and it's not hard to see why. These services make it possible for small-scale businesses and new operations to gauge public interest in unique and sometimes innovative ideas. Kickstarter alone is home to numerous success stories within tech, including the iconic Pebble E Ink smartwatches (which are in the process of being reborn for the modern age).\nOf course, not all Kickstarter ideas have legs, and there have also been several high-profile projects that have risen to meteoric proportions during the financial backing phase, only to crash and burn once actually on the consumer market. Within the tech space, there's perhaps no better example of this than the infamous Android-based Ouya microconsole from 2013.\nWith MagInk, I have high hopes. The Kickstarter campaign appears healthy thus far, and the concept of a personalized external power bank is something I can genuinely get behind. Aside from the allure of customization and adding personality to an otherwise drab category of smartphone accessory, there's real utility in programming images onto a small color E Ink display. I can invision using the low-power-consumption panel to display everything from photos of pets and loved ones, to travel tickets, or even a grocery shopping list or a to-do list.\n...I think MagInk has room to expand in scope.\nConsidering how efficient ePaper displays are, color or otherwise, as well as how great they are in terms of outdoor visibility in direct sunlight, I think MagInk has room to expand in scope. Personally, I'd love to see a dedicated version that drops the external battery bank entirely, instead assuming the form of a super-slim magnetic back cover that serves the sole purpose of displaying content on the back of my phone.\nIf you're interested in pledging support for MagInk, you can check out their Kickstarter campaign by following this link.\nThis power bank juiced up my MacBook, Switch 2, and iPhone 16 - all on one charge\nThis power bank is great for remote workers and gamers on the go."

      "text": "Summary\n- HomeKit is not limited just to homeowners; there are many great accessories for apartment dwellers too.\n- Many HomeKit accessories are apartment-friendly and don't require rewiring or drilling holes, making them ideal for renters.\n- HomeKit security cameras, like the Eufy C120, offer privacy features such as HomeKit Secure Video, ensuring footage is encrypted and stored securely in iCloud.\nHome automation is a lot of fun. While sometimes frustrating, Apple HomeKit attempts to make the experience more unified and accessible. As an Apple enthusiast, I naturally gravitated towards HomeKit as my smart home solution. Since first dipping my toes in late 2016, I've outfitted two apartments, a condo, and, most recently, a house, surpassing over 100 HomeKit accessories.\nHome automation often feels like a homeowner's game because many HomeKit accessories require rewiring thermostats and light switches or swapping door locks. Rest assured, if you're an apartment dweller and interested in home automation, there are still plenty of fantastic non-invasive options for you, too. Here's a list of apartment-friendly HomeKit accessories that don't require rewiring or hole drilling. Your landlord won't even notice.\nBest Apple HomeKit devices: 8 compatible accessories for your smart home\nGet the most out of your smart home and devices with these accessories for Apple HomeKit.\n6 Meross Smart Plug\nIncredible convenience\nSmart plugs offer the simple ability to turn appliances like lamps on and off remotely or by a scheduled routine. Smart plugs are particularly great in spaces requiring lamps due to a lack of overhead lighting. In the past, I've grouped several smart plugs together to turn multiple lamps on and off simultaneously rather than doing it one at a time manually.\nMeross is a HomeKit brand I've used for several years now because of its inexpensive price point, accessibility on Amazon, and decent reliability. As such, it's become my go-to choice for smart plugs. Meross offers single- and dual-outlet versions. Single outlet models can be bought in a two-, three- or four-pack, with increasing discounts on Amazon. At the same time, the dual outlet one can be bought in a two-pack.\nI upgraded my kitchen with a $30 Wemo Smart Plug and HomeKit\nIt integrates with Apple HomeKit to make your life easier.\n5 Philips Hue Lightbulbs\nAn OG HomeKit brand\nOf course, in apartments, we can't remove and replace dumb light switches with smart ones. Therefore, smart light bulbs make for a great solution. Philips Hue bulbs are one of the original HomeKit-supported products. For as long as I've used HomeKit, Philips Hue was the top contender for smart bulbs. Since then, we've seen companies like IKEA, Meross, LIFX, and VOCOlinc come out with competing options, each with its own pros and cons.\nHowever, Philips Hue is still the market leader. Hue bulbs are known for being pricy but reliable, partly thanks to a hub requirement. Philips Hue offers the broadest range of bulbs for different temperatures, colors, fixtures, and appliances. Philips Hue has you covered if you just want a basic white smart bulb, a colored bulb, or a specialty bulb for your oven.\n4 August Wi-Fi Smart Lock\n8 years later, one is still going strong\nAugust Home Wi-Fi Smart Lock (4th Generation)\nSmart locks are one of the most popular smart home products among consumers. For renters, the challenge is that most smart locks also replace the key being used, making it unacceptable for landlords who require access to their property. The solution is August's Wi-Fi Smart Lock. With HomeKit support, this smart lock only replaces the rear of your door's deadbolt, not the front lock. The August Wi-Fi Smart Lock is an easy upgrade for any renter to swap the back of their door with this small motor. This upgrade doesn't violate any leases, keeps the keys the same, and can easily be brought with you to your new place. In fact, my friend has been using my old August Wi-Fi Smart Lock for at least six years on top of the two I used it beforehand.\nPhilips made smart lock you can open with the palm of your hand\nPhilips is launching three different smart locks with advanced technology.\n3 Mysa AC Controller\nCool and versatile\nWhile air conditioners are a supported category in HomeKit, surprisingly few are on the market. Fortunately, a fantastic alternative is the Mysa AC controller. This HomeKit accessory is basically just an IR blaster for AC units and heat pumps. Using the Mysa app and your AC unit's remote, you configure the Mysa AC controller to communicate with your cooling appliance. The Mysa AC controller appears in HomeKit like a thermostat, giving you the available control options! The Mysa AC controller just needs a clear line of light to the AC unit or heat pump. Once again, just bring it with you when you leave your apartment. No mess, no fuss. It's very versatile.\nHow to create an Alexa Home Theatre system with your Echo and Fire TV\nStep-by-step instructions on how to create a home theatre experience with your Echo speaker and a Fire TV.\n2 Eufy C120 Indoor Camera\nHomeKit Secure Video for the win\nI get the hesitation of having security cameras inside your house. The thought of being watched is creepy, to say the least. However, HomeKit makes it very easy to configure compatible cameras to turn on when you leave and turn off upon arriving home. As a pet owner, I enjoy having a way to monitor my dogs and house when I am out, but I also want my privacy when I am at home.\nI've found the Eufy C120 indoor cameras to be an excellent yet inexpensive way to do this. I chose these cameras because they support HomeKit Secure Video as part of my iCloud+ subscription, so all of my video footage is never seen by Eufy or Apple; it's encrypted by my HomeKit home hub and then to Apple's servers for storage in an unreadable format. The Eufy C120s are pretty cheap on Amazon and don't require anything beyond an outlet. I recommend mounting them with a command strip to avoid damaging your walls.\nBlink's Outdoor 4 camera wasn't the affordable home security solution I was hoping for\nThe camera's hardware and software both leave a lot to be desired.\n1 Accent Lighting\nMany more choices\nNanoleaf Shapes Hexagons\nMulti-colored smart light tiles that are compatible with Apple HomeKit.\nFollowing smart plugs for lamps and smart lightbulbs, accent lighting is another easy, non-permanent way to personalize your apartment with HomeKit. There are endless great contenders like the Meross smart lamp, Philips Hue Go, Philips Hue Bloom, Nanoleaf Shapes, and Nanoleaf lines. Just like with the Eufy camera, I recommend mounting the Nanoleaf Shapes and Lines with command strips to make removing and adjusting placement easier. Smart lighting is excellent for setting a mood with colors, brightening a space without turning on the main room light, and turning off with an app or your voice.\nNanoleaf smart lights now include outdoor options\nNanoleaf's popular smart lights have broken free of the confines of your home at CES 2024. Plus, you can now buy its new Skylight."

  "argos_summary": "The article describes how the author, living in a small apartment, turned to hydroponic gardening to grow fresh herbs and vegetables without soil, using LetPot\u2019s 12\u2011Pod system. It highlights the system\u2019s compact design, quiet pump, adjustable LED light, and intuitive app that allows remote control of watering and lighting schedules. The author praises the ease of maintenance and the ability to grow year\u2011round, while noting a steep initial setup and a somewhat bright low\u2011mode light as minor drawbacks. Overall, the piece presents hydroponics as a practical, space\u2011saving solution for urban indoor gardening.",
