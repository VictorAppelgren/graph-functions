  "title": "RFK Jr. invokes Democrat father\u2019s words to defend Trump-backed CDC shakeup at Senate hearing",
  "description": "Health Secretary RFK Jr. quotes his father while defending CDC reforms that led to the firing of a director and staff resignations amid the Trump administration's changes.",
  "content": "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited his father, Robert Kennedy, a former U.S. Attorney General and senator from New York, while testifying on Capitol Hill about backlash over the Trump administration's efforts to reform the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department (HHS) head signaled a dramatic course-correction at the CDC several days before the hearing, which came amid reports of the administration's decision to fire CDC Director Susan Monarez. Monarez's firing spurred backlash among Democrats who complained that the administration's efforts to reform the CDC, including through staff and budget cuts, were politicizing public health and undermining scientific integrity.\n\n\"The people at the CDC who oversaw [the COVID-19 mitigation] process, who put masks on our children, who closed our schools, are the people who will be leaving,\" Kennedy said during his opening remarks, shortly after the hearing was briefly interrupted by a heckler. \"That's why we need bold, competent, and creative new leadership at CDC. People who are able to and willing to chart a new course.\"\n\nRFK JR AND TOP DEM CLASH DURING HEATED SENATE HEARING: 'THIS IS ABOUT KIDS'\n\n\"As my father once said, 'progress is a nice word, but change is its motivator. And change has its enemies.'\" The health secretary, who is also the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, continued: \"That's why we need new blood at CDC.\"\n\nThursday's brief moment when Kennedy invoked his father, who was shot and killed while serving as a U.S. senator in 1968, would not be the first time the Kennedy family has been invoked in the health secretary's approach to governing. In the lead up to President Donald Trump's 2024 election victory, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s sister, Kerry Kennedy, slammed him for supporting Trump and \"desecrat[ing] and trampl[ing] and set[ting] fire\" to their dad's memory.\n\nThe quote from RFK Jr.'s father comes from a speech he made to the United States Conference of Mayors in Chicago in 1963. The remarks came while he was serving as attorney general under former Democratic Party president Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nKennedy's speech in Chicago discussed contemporary economic stresses and poverty in the early 1960s, noting they had resulted in an \"unwanted stockpile of idle youth,\" according to a copy of the speech shared by the Department of Justice (DOJ). The then-attorney general suggested the issue was exacerbated by a lack of equal access to education, vocation training and poor housing that was occurring at the time.\n\n\"The hardest task is to appoint and incorporate in our work a group of men and women with the power and willingness to look at our community difficulties, dissect them, criticize areas of shortcoming, and make meaningful suggestion,\" Kennedy said during his speech to the conference of mayors. \"Sometimes, too, it is hard to accept that sort of recommendation. For, sometimes, it carries with it announced or implied criticism of programs that have failed us in the past. Change means that someone's professional feathers will be ruffled, that a glass-topped desk might be moved to another office or abandoned, that pet programs might die.\"\n\n\"Progress is the nice word we like to use. But change is its motivator. And change has its enemies,\" Kennedy continued. \"The willingness to confront that change will determine how much we shall really do for our youth and how truly meaningful our efforts will be.\"\n\nAmid the CDC shakeup being spearheaded by RFK Jr., over 1,000 current and former federal health officials penned a letter this week calling for the HHS secretary's resignation, arguing he is \"endanger[ing] the nation's health.\" Following Monarez's ouster, several other top CDC officials resigned in protest of the Trump administration's policies on public health.\n\nMeanwhile, Kennedy penned an op-ed earlier this week in the Wall Street Journal echoing his Thursday remarks on Capitol Hill that the changes coming to the CDC are restoring confidence in an agency that lost the public's trust due to its response to the COVID-19 virus.\n\nPREVIOUS CDC DIRECTORS ACCUSE RFK JR. OF ENDANGERING ALL AMERICANS IN NY TIMES ESSAY\n\n\"Most CDC rank-and-file staff are honest public servants,\" the health secretary wrote. \"Under this renewed mission, they can do their jobs as scientists without bowing to politics.\"",

      "text": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday that the American public has lost faith in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and outlined his plan to rebuild trust in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal.\nKennedy blamed decades of bureaucracy, politicized science and \"mission creep\" for eroding the CDC\u2019s core role of protecting Americans from infectious disease and squandering public confidence.\nKennedy pointed to the CDC\u2019s response to COVID-19 as an example of dysfunction that \"produced irrational policy\" and further eroded trust in the agency.\n\"Cloth masks on toddlers, arbitrary 6-foot distancing, boosters for healthy children, prolonged school closings, economy-crushing lockdowns, and the suppression of low-cost therapeutics in favor of experimental and ineffective drugs,\" he wrote. \"The toll was devastating.\"\nMORE THAN 1,000 HHS WORKERS DEMAND KENNEDY RESIGNATION OVER CDC DIRECTOR FIRING AND AGENCY CHANGES\nAlthough some may see the agency's missteps during the pandemic as a one-off mistake, Kennedy asserted that this failure was \"no anomaly,\" citing declining life expectancy and declining trust from the public as evidence.\n\"Trust has collapsed: Only one-third of health care workers participated in the 2023-24 fall COVID booster program, and fewer than 10% of children under 12 received boosters in 2024-25. The American people no longer believe the CDC has their best interests at heart,\" he wrote.\nOn an operational level, the HHS secretary was critical of the CDC's budget allocation and staffing. He ripped the agency for having only half of its total budget support its infectious-disease mission, and for the fact that fewer than 1 in 10 employees are epidemiologists\u2014which he blames for the CDC's \"disastrous\" pandemic response.\nDespite his sharp criticisms, Kennedy expressed hope that the agency could be restored to its former effectiveness. He noted that the CDC's response to a measles outbreak this year showed how the agency can \"act swiftly with precision when guided by science and freed from ideology.\"\nKennedy highlighted some of the actions already taken by the Trump administration to tackle the issues impacting the CDC, such as replacing leaders who've resisted reform and eliminating conflicts of interests and bureaucratic complacency.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\"First, the CDC must restore public trust\u2014and that restoration has begun. It won\u2019t stop until America\u2019s public-health institutions again serve the people with transparency, honesty and integrity,\" he concluded.\nFox News Digital reached out to the CDC for further comment.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nMore than 1,000 current and former employees of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) signed a letter calling on Kennedy to resign on Wednesday.\nThe employees cited Kennedy's recent ousting of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Susan Monarez. They also accused Kennedy of appointing \"political ideologues\" to positions of authority.\nThat followed nine former directors and former acting CDC directors who wrote Monday in The New York Times that Kennedy's leadership was endangering all Americans, accusing him of downplaying vaccines and focusing on unproven treatments.\nHHS didn't respond to a request for comment."

Kennedy Jr. are weaponizing public health for political gain and putting millions of American lives at risk.\n\"When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda,\" the statement said. \"For that, she has been targeted.

When Monarez did not immediately commit, she was told by administration officials that she must resign or she would be fired.\nSources also claimed she then attempted to involve the chairman of the Senate's top health committee, Sen.

Shortly after Weldon stepped down, Monarez was formally nominated to be the CDC's permanent director and was eventually confirmed in the final week of July.\nDuring Monarez's confirmation hearing, she expressed support for vaccines and told lawmakers she has \"not seen a causal link between vaccines and autism.\"\nMEDICAL GROUP GOES AGAINST CDC, RECOMMENDS COVID SHOTS FOR YOUNG KIDS\nPrior to Monarez's Senate confirmation, CDC directors did not typically require Senate approval, but that changed in 2022 when Congress passed a law making it necessary.

Kennedy Jr. defended the Trump\u2011era overhaul of the CDC, citing his father\u2019s words to justify the firing of Director Susan Monarez and the departure of senior staff.
