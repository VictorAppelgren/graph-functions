  "content": "JACKSONVILLE, FL / ACCESS Newswire / August 15, 2025 / U.S. Navy Surface Warfare Officer Davaile Durham is using his recent feature interview to bring attention to a cause close to his heart: supporting at-risk youth and encouraging mentorship in underserved communities. The Missouri native and Navy leader was recently profiled in an article titled \"From Fast Food to Navy Leadership: Davaile Durham's Journey\"-a candid look at his personal and professional path, and how his experiences drive his passion for giving back.\n\n\"I've been the kid working a fast food job just trying to stay afloat,\" said Durham in the interview. \"If someone hadn't seen potential in me, I wouldn't be where I am. Now it's my turn to do the same for someone else.\"\n\nAdvocating for At-Risk Youth: Why It Matters\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Education, over 1.3 million students drop out of high school every year. Many of these students face barriers such as poverty, unstable housing, and lack of access to mentorship or positive role models. Studies show that young people with mentors are 55% more likely to enroll in college, and 130% more likely to hold leadership positions later in life (source: MENTOR National).\n\nDurham's story echoes this reality. He credits sports, structure, and strong mentorship-including through the military-for changing the direction of his life.\n\n\"Track taught me discipline. Cooking in the Navy taught me pressure. But it was mentorship that taught me purpose,\" Durham said. \"At-risk youth don't need saving. They need support. They need someone to show up.\"\n\nWhen Durham isn't serving at sea, he's serving his community-volunteering at youth centers, mentoring teens, and running charity races to raise funds for outreach programs. He focuses his efforts on helping young people who, like him, started with limited options but big potential.\n\n\"I see myself in them. I've walked that road,\" he said. \"That's why I keep showing up.\"\n\nDurham encourages others-regardless of background or job title-to consider what they can do in their own neighborhoods. Whether it's helping with a local youth program, becoming a mentor, or simply listening to a young person in need, he believes change begins with consistent, small actions.\n\n\"You don't need a uniform to make an impact,\" he added. \"You just need to care.\"",
