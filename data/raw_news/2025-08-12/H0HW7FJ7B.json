  "content": "Man charged with murder of Australian couple in graffiti-covered house\n\nA homeless man in the Australian state of Victoria has been charged with the alleged murder of a pregnant woman and her partner, whose head was decapitated. Police were called to a unit in Melbourne's south-east on Monday evening where they found the bodies of Athena Georgopoulos, 39, and Andrew Gunn, 50. Several hours later, a man, 34, was arrested at a train station about 7km from the scene. He was charged with double murder and is due to appear in court on Wednesday. Police say the attack appears to be targeted but the relationship between the couple and the accused is not yet known. Police are also investigating graffiti outside the unit with the words \"betrayal\" and \"enough is enough\".\n\nVictoria police first received a call on Monday evening, requesting a welfare check at the Mount Waverley unit after \"some yelling\" was heard from the property. Police received a second call a few minutes later, prompting authorities to rush to the address, arriving just before 22:00 where the two bodies were found. According to local media reports, Georgopoulos was five months pregnant with a baby girl. Early investigations suggest the alleged suspect arrived at the unit on Monday evening, and \"then obviously an altercation has occurred,\" police told the media. \"It appears to be a targeted attack, our suspect is known to the address,\" homicide squad detective Dean Thomas said. \"It does not appear to be a random attack and we are not looking for anybody else.\" Thomas said the suspect appears to have known Mr Gunn, but police were still working out the connection. A Victoria Police spokesperson confirmed to the BBC that detectives will also investigate if graffiti found outside the unit is relevant to the murder investigation.",
