      "feedback": "The draft is conceptually rich but fails the 4–6 sentence executive brief test and risks diluting the causal chain; tighten to a single, crisp house view: (1) adopt a compact 3-regime map (A: persistent‑inflation/high discount rates; B: inflation closer to target/measured easing; C: tariff/policy/export‑driven stress) with explicit, source‑backed triggers (e.g., CPI prints, Fed guidance, tariff news) and a single invalidation rule. (2) braid the regime logic into one coherent causal chain: inflation dynamics drive policy/reaction, which sets the discount rate and risk premia, which in turn drives equity/credit valuations; attach the relevant source IDs after each claim (e.g., Y6SQOEK69 for Regime A trigger, 15 for easing risk, 9 for tariff tail risk). (3) collapse redundancies and move the HVAC/regulation block to a concise, regime‑risk line or a separate “macro regime risks” note, so the core 3–6 month income thesis (ABT/ABBV/PFE yields from WISLWAJ15) remains front and center. (4) quantify where possible within the source set: present base‑case ranges for the regime state, the dividend/cash‑flow anchors, and the watch‑list triggers (e.g., LOE timing, pipeline milestones) using the numbers in WISLWAJ15, 22PL3Q360, LLN6N4H3Z, STBVARD8F, ACMR, YVQU6QCY4, instead of ad hoc assertions. (5) ensure 100% citation density: every factual claim has a corresponding source, and reconcile any conflicting signals by labeling them as consensus versus residual views from the cited IDs (e.g., tariff implications from 9 vs. long‑horizon inflation risk from 15/YVQU6QCY4). (6) deliver in a single page, 4–6 sentence structure or bullet‑point format with a base case, 1–2 alternative scenarios, 3–4 near‑term catalysts, and explicit invalidation triggers, so the piece is decision‑useful for an expert audience.",
