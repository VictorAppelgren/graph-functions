      "feedback": "The analysis draft provides a solid foundation but could benefit from enhanced clarity and depth in several areas. First, strengthen the causal chain by explicitly linking the revenue-sharing policy to specific economic outcomes, such as its potential impact on U.S.-China trade dynamics and domestic market reactions. Incorporate more quantitative data, such as projected revenue figures or stock price changes for Nvidia and AMD, to substantiate claims about market implications. Additionally, clarify the legal concerns surrounding the revenue-sharing agreement by referencing specific constitutional provisions or precedents that could be challenged. Ensure that the conclusion succinctly summarizes the base case and key risks while emphasizing the importance of monitoring specific upcoming events, such as trade negotiations and legal rulings. Finally, maintain a consistent tone and style throughout to align with the multi-year horizon focus, avoiding any generic statements.",
