  "description": "Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken was kicked off a Hampton beach for violating local warnings that closed the Long Island hotspot due to Hurricane Erin\u2019s dangerous impact.",
  "content": "Beaches across the tri-state region finally reopened Saturday after Hurricane Erin churned through the area \u2014 but the lifting of restrictions came a day too late for former Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nBlinken, 63, was kicked off East Hampton\u2019s exclusive Georgica Beach while catching rays with a friend, photos showed.\n\nThe beach had been closed days earlier from the rough conditions unleashed along the East Coast by the massive storm.\n\nThe ex-Biden official and a pal were on the sand Friday when they were ordered to get out by a lifeguard patrol\n\nFollowing a brief conversation with the lifeguards, a barefoot Blinken, wearing a blue long-sleeve shirt and black shorts, picked up a tote bag, grabbed a beach towel, folded up his chair and took the walk of shame back to the asphalt parking lot.\n\nLarge waves crashed behind the beachgoers before Blinken left, photos showed.\n\nThe Long Island hotspot is popular with surfers, sitting on the south end of the Apaquogue neighborhood.\n\nMost beaches reopened to the public Saturday with swimming still restricted in some spots, officials said.\n\nErin exploded into a Category 5 storm as it developed in the Caribbean before charging its way up the North Atlantic, staying offshore as it barreled up the East Coast.\n\nThe once 500-mile wide storm, one of the largest recorded in history, stayed roughly 800 miles off New York\u2019s coastline.\n\n\u201cEven though Hurricane Erin has left our region, because it was such an extremely large storm, it has left a lot of the Atlantic still stirred up,\u201d Fox Weather meteorologist Cody Braud told The Post Saturday.\n\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s left the premises, it\u2019s going to take a little while for all the water to come back to a calmer level. There are still a lot of hidden effects and the biggest thing is the high rip current risk that is still present up and down the East Coast.\u201d\n\nTemperatures for tomorrow were expected to stay in the low 80s in NYC and on most of Long Island, with the Jersey Shore seeing the mercury reach the upper 70s and low 80s, Braud said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s starting to get a little cooler too, so it\u2019s probably not the best beach-going weather anyway at the moment,\u201d he said.\n\nSome Jersey Shore beaches were expected to remain closed Saturday for cleanup, according to a report.\n\nHe was vacationing at the Long Island hotspot on Aug. 15, 2021, hours before the Taliban took over Kabul, Afghanistan, and quickly left to tend to the crisis.\n\nThe Democratic lawyer\u2019s father Donald Blinken, the former US Ambassador to Hungary under President Clinton, seasonally lived on Lily Pond Lane for more than 50 years.",

      "text": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia to be deported after refusing plea offer\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Immigration officials said they intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda, after he declined an offer to be sent to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, according to a Saturday court filing.\nThe Costa Rica offer came late Thursday, after it was clear that the Salvadoran national would likely be released from a Tennessee jail the following day. Abrego Garcia declined to extend his stay in jail and was released on Friday to await trial in Maryland with his family. Later that day, the Department of Homeland Security notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.\nHis attorneys declined to comment on whether the plea offer had been formally rescinded. The brief they filed only said that Abrego Garcia had declined one part of the offer \u2014 to remain in jail \u2014 and that his attorneys would \u201ccommunicate the government\u2019s proposal to Mr. Abrego.\u201d\nFiled along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn\u2019t face the possibility of detention. An additional benefit of the offer would be that Costa Rica is a Spanish-speaking country, like Abrego Garcia\u2019s native El Salvador. Abrego Garcia would only be deported to Costa Rica after serving his sentence on the smuggling charges, according to the brief.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s case became a flashpoint in President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported in March. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The Saturday filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.\n\u201cThe government immediately responded to Mr. Abrego\u2019s release with outrage,\u201d the filing reads. \u201cDespite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr. Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr. Abrego\u2019s counsel that the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda and ordered him to report to ICE\u2019s Baltimore Field Office Monday morning,\u201d it says, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nStay up to date on alleged MS-13 gangbanger Kilmar Abrego Garcia\n- Trump admin plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia after prison release \u2013 and not to El Salvador, prosecutor tells judge\n- Kilmar Abrego Garcia back in US to face charges of trafficking thousands of illegal migrants \u2014 including MS-13 gangbangers\n- Moment alleged MS-13 gangbanger Kilmar Abrego Garcia was accused of human trafficking revealed in new bodycam video\n- Alleged MS-13 gangbanger\u2019s rank, street name revealed as fight over deportation to El Salvador megaprison rages: docs\n- Supreme Court rules Trump admin must \u2018facilitate\u2019 return of wrongfully deported Maryland man\nAbrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the smuggling charges, which stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\nA Department of Homeland Security agent testified that he didn\u2019t begin investigating the traffic stop until this April, when the government was facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.\nAlthough Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. A recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours\u2019 notice before initiating deportation proceedings \u2014 time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.\n\u201cPlease let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),\u201d it states.\nFederal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador where he faces a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of violence, according to court filings."
