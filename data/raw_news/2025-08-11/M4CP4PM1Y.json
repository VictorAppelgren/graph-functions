  "content": "The CEO of Mercedes-Benz MBGn.DE criticized the European Union's plan to ban CO2-emitting vehicles from 2035 in a media interview on Monday, joining a chorus of voices calling the target into question as it comes up for review this year.\n\nThe ban, which supporters say is crucial to Europe's green ambitions, is up for review in the second half of 2025, with critics saying it would handicap European carmakers already struggling with weak demand, Chinese competition and disappointing electric vehicle sales.\n\n\"We need a reality check. Otherwise we are heading at full speed against a wall,\" Mercedes CEO Ola Kaellenius told the Handelsblatt business daily of the 2035 goal, adding that Europe's car market could \"collapse\" if it goes ahead.\n\nKaellenius argued that consumers would simply hurry to buy cars with petrol or diesel engines ahead of the ban.\n\nCurrently serving as head of the European auto lobby ACEA, the German auto boss has instead called for tax incentives and cheap power prices at charging stations to encourage the switch to electric cars.\n\n\"Of course we have to decarbonize, but it has to be done in a technology-neutral way. We must not lose sight of our economy,\" Kaellenius said.\n\nReporting by Rachel More, Editing by Miranda Murray",

      "text": "10 things you shouldn't keep in a hot car during a heat wave\nStates around the country are expected to once again see high temperatures this week.\nAs the numbers creep up, you may want to check what's in your car. Just like when it's freezing outside, there are certain things you shouldn't leave in the car during scorching temperatures.\nHere's what to know:\nNever leave your children or pets in your car unattended\nIt's never OK to leave a child or pet in a hot car. And cracking a window doesn't make a difference either, the American Veterinary Medical Association notes.\nTemperatures in your vehicle can become dangerous very quickly. Last year, 39 children died in the U.S. from heatstroke in vehicles, up 35% from 2023, according to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.\nWhat else shouldn't I leave in the car when its hot out?\nAerosol cans\nExtreme temperatures can cause aerosol cans to \"become unstable\" and potentially break or explode, according to Capital One Auto Navigator.\nBatteries\nKeeping batteries in hot weather or direct sunlight poses a fire risk, the U.S. Fire Administration says. Batteries that overheat can also leak or rupture.\nYou should always follow the manufacturer\u2019s directions for batteries.\nElectronics\nLike with batteries, you should always follow the manufacturer\u2019s directions when it comes to electronics. Most \u2014 like Apple and Samsung \u2014 recommend you don't expose products to extreme temperatures at all.\nFood and beverages\nYou shouldn\u2019t leave your groceries in a hot car for more than two hours, or one hour when it\u2019s above 90 degrees, Geico recommends. Not only can some items, like canned beverages, make a mess in extreme temperatures, the FDA says food borne illness-causing bacteria doubles every 20 minutes.\nLighters\nThe flammable fuel inside of lighters could expand and breach its casing, posing a fire or explosion risk, according to Geico. The USB Lighter Company notes disposable or cheaper lighters are also more susceptible to extreme temperature effects than other kinds.\nMedications\nExtreme temperatures can cause medications to become less effective or cause unintended side effects, Baylor College of Medicine notes. You should not take medications if they have been exposed to heat and have changed color, texture or odor.\nIf you\u2019re unsure whether a medication has gone bad, you should call a pharmacist or healthcare provider. Most medication bottles also have temperature and expiration dates, according to Baylor College of Medicine.\nPlastic bottles\nPlastic water bottles are known to \u201cleach\u201d chemicals into water, a process driven by heat, according to USA TODAY. If you drink what's inside of a plastic bottle that\u2019s been left in a hot car, you could be ingesting some harmful chemicals.\nSunscreen\nSunscreen that's exposed to high temperatures can shorten its shelf life, Geico said, citing the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
