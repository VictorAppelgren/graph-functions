  "title": "Which Harley-Davidson Model Has The Biggest Gas Tank?",
  "description": "Even if you bought a brand-new Harley-Davidson, you still need enough gas to get to where you're going. So what's the biggest gas tank you can get?",
  "content": "Which Harley-Davidson Model Has The Biggest Gas Tank?\n\nVery few motorcycle brands can claim to evoke the same sense of freedom and adventure as a Harley-Davidson motorcycle does. As one of the oldest, most popular motorcycling companies in the world, Harley built its reputation on big-bore V-twin cruisers and touring machines, all of which cemented its image as the maker of bikes for cruising highways, small-town main streets, and long-distance touring. Carrying forward its legacy, Harley, today, continues to sell a variety of motorcycles across various categories, ranging from tourers, cruisers, and trikes to adventure tourers and sport models. Irrespective of the type of Harley one rides, there's one very practical factor that often separates a carefree ride from a frustrating one: fuel capacity. Having to constantly check if you have enough fuel to reach the next gas station isn't something most motorcyclists want to think of while enjoying a thrilling cross-country ride. Small fuel tanks have never been an issue with Harleys, given the company's focus on big-bore cruisers and tourers. In fact, Harley-Davidson motorcycles are known for their high-capacity fuel tanks. We found that the largest fuel tank capacity offered on a stock Harley-Davidson (as of 2025) is 6 gallons (22.7 liters). However, that same model of tank is shared across multiple motorcycles. We also discovered that the smallest fuel tank currently offered on a stock Harley-Davidson motorcycle is 3.1 gallons (11.7 liters), limited to some of its Sport models.\n\nIf your goal is a brand-new Harley with the biggest fuel tank, you have to look at models from the company's \"Grand American Touring\" and three-wheeled \"Trike\" lineup. All models from the Grand American Touring lineup \u2014 including the Road King Special, the Street Glide series, and the associated CVO models \u2014 come with a 6-gallon fuel tank. These machines offer roughly 40-45 mpg, giving them considerable range. As for the Trike models, all three 2025 model year offerings \u2014 the Freewheeler, Road Glide 3, and Tri Glide Ultra \u2014 feature a 6-gallon fuel tank. All of these machines also offer between 40 and 43 mpg. Harley's adventure tourer models \u2014 which include the Pan America 1250 and the CVO Pan America \u2014 feature a slightly smaller 5.6-gallon (21-liter) fuel tank. However, these models do have slightly better fuel efficiency numbers, which could help bring their range closer to that of the Trike and Tourer models, so if your main concern is getting the most miles between fuel stops, any of the Harley models mentioned above will serve you well. Harley's trademark Cruiser motorcycles, which include machines like the Low Rider, Breakout, Fat Boy, and Heritage Classic, all come with a 5-gallon fuel tank. The Street Bob is an exception in this lineup, with a smaller 3.5-gallon fuel capacity. The smallest fuel tank on the current Harley-Davidson motorcycle lineup (3.1 gallons) is found on the company's Sport models, like the Nightster and Sportster.\n\nOver six gallons? Only with third-party mods The 6-gallon fuel tanks that some Harley-Davidson motorcycles sport scratch the upper limit of fuel tank capacity on the company's lineup. While this is a big enough capacity for most motorcyclists and long-distance tourers, for people wanting even more single-tank range, the only option is to opt for even larger fuel tanks made by third-party vendors. While several 3rd party mods center around increasing the tank capacity of Harleys with smaller fuel tanks, there are some companies that make fuel tanks that exceed 6 gallons in capacity. Remmotorycle, a motorcycle-focused e-commerce company, lists a massive 6.3-gallon (24-liter) fuel tank that is designed to work with Harley Davidson Softail models launched since 2018. The product is simply called the \"Large Capacity Softail Fuel Tank\" and is made to order. The largest Harley-Davidson-focused gas tanks we could find were from HogWorkz, which makes two 6.6-gallon (25-liter) fuel tanks. The company currently sells two models in this category: a Stretched 6.6 Gallon Gas Tank and a Stretched Bodyarc 6.6 Gallon Gas Tank, both of which fit a variety of Harley tourers produced between 2008 and 2025. The company states that the fit of these tanks also means that the stock seat would need to be replaced with a new one. With a price tag between $470 and $650, upgrading to larger fuel tanks isn't what we would call affordable \u2014 and this is excluding the fitment charges, as well as the cost incurred for making additional modifications like changing the seat.",

      "text": "Everything To Know About Harley-Davidson Pan America Motorcycles\nThe image that most people have of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle is usually the lusciously loud, chromed, beefy Wide Glide or Fat Boy ridden by rough-and-tumble outlaw bikers (or weekend warriors who want to portray them). But that image needs to be readjusted, as in early 2021, the all-American cruiser maker got into the adventure motorcycle game with the Pan America.\nAn adventure bike (also known as an ADV) is a street-legal version of an enduro-style off-road dirt bike that can not only be ridden comfortably for long distances on asphalt paved streets but along rutted trails and up steep inclines made up of loose rock and dirt \u2014 not an easy feat to accomplish.\nThe first of these ADVs appeared in 1980 when BMW unleashed the R80 G/S, about a decade before the term \"adventure bike\" was invented. The G/S stands for Gel\u00e4nde/Stra\u00dfe (roughly \"ground\" and \"street\"), referring to its ability to ride perfectly fine in both environments.\nPerhaps contributing to adventure biking's popularity over the last twenty years started when acclaimed actor Ewan McGregor and his friend and fellow actor Charlie Boorman set out on the first of three globetrotting motorcycle rides covering more than 46,000 miles and dozens of countries. Each season of the well-received docu-series probably made a lot of people want to go the long way just about everywhere.\nTouring becomes detouring\nFor the last four decades, the ADV market has been ruled by the likes of BMW, Honda, Yamaha, and KTM, which has the most manufacturer wins at the Dakar Rally. So when Harley dropped the Pan America 1250 and Pan America Special 1250 in 2021, jaws dropped.\nThese weren't your typical Hogs by any stretch of the imagination but were so well constructed that they quickly became recognized as one of the best Harleys ever made. It's quite the accomplishment for a manufacturer who only recently tipped its toe into a much bigger pond beyond big, bulky cruisers.\nThe Pan America is powered by a liquid-cooled 1,250cc V-twin called the Revolution Max 1250. The 150 hp 76.4 cubic inch V-twin design (producing 94 lb-ft of torque) mated to a six-speed gearbox may actually be better than the flat-twin layout of BMW bikes as it not only makes the Harley slimmer than BMWs but also has better protection against the spills that are part and parcel of adventure riding.\nA base model weighs 534 pounds (wet); the Special 559 pounds. Both are a tad heftier than many other ADVs on the market despite the Revolution Max being directly integrated into the bike as the central member of the chassis. It was designed with low-end torque and a low-speed throttle, both of which are must-haves while riding in hazardous off-road conditions. And while it typically uses a belt drive on their bikes, the Pan America has a chain.\nDefinitely one cool ADV\nOther head-scratching, paradigm-shifting anomalies \u2014 not usually found on an H-D bike but are on the ADV \u2014 is a 6.8-inch color TFT screen that displays ride data, GPS maps, and all the other important things (i.e., speedometer, gear, odometer, fuel level, clock, trip, low temp alert, side stand down alert, TIP over alert, cruise, range, and tachometer). It's also Bluetooth-capable for phone and headset pairing.\nDaymaker Signature LED lights wrap the bike (headlight, tail/stop light, bullet turn signals), and the headlight moves to illuminate the area ahead of where the motorcycle is turning.\nRiders can choose from five pre-programmed Ride Modes (Sport, Road, Rain, Off-Road, and Off-Road Plus) and even input their own custom mode. The AVD is also equipped with a Cornering Enhanced Antilock Braking System (C-ABS) and Cornering Enhanced Traction Control System (C-TCS), which gets the bike through turns as efficiently and safely as possible.\nThe optional Adaptive Ride Height feature lowers seat height when the bike comes to a stop. What's more, while at speed, the system constantly senses weight input and can sustain the most favorable suspension sag by fine-tuning preload.\nGiven all that, it's not hard to see why Harley-Davidson's Pan America is now considered one of the coolest adventure motorcycles you can buy."

      "text": "How Much HP Does The Harley-Davidson Low Rider S Have? What To Know Before You Buy\nThe 2024 Harley-Davidson Low Rider S is among the brand's most affordable bikes that blend club style, West Coast styling, and exhilarating cruiser performance. With prices starting at $19,999, Harley has given the new Low Rider S a larger-displacement Milwaukee-Eight 117 V-twin motor \u2014 an engine that's helped power some of the fastest Harley-Davidson bikes ever made \u2014 boasting 117 cubic inches (1,923cc) of displacement, electronic sequential port fuel injection, and a two-into-two shotgun exhaust.\nProducing 103 horsepower and 125 pound-feet of torque, the Milwaukee-Eight 117 delivers 14% more horsepower and more torque than the Milwaukee-Eight 114 in the previous Low Rider S. Paired with cruise control, highway riding can be a breeze \u2014 and, Harley-Davidson notes, will help \"save you from speeding\" on the roadway and taking in more of the sights.\nEquipped with a chain-driven six-speed gearbox, the Harley-Davidson Low Rider S has the style, presence, and sound that novice and experienced riders love in a Harley cruiser. The throwback vibes include blacked-out detailing and dark bronze cast aluminum wheels inherited from the original Low Rider S unveiled in 2016.\nUpdated digital gauges, higher suspension, and more\nGone is the quirky tank-mounted gauge pod of the old Low Rider S. Instead, Harley-Davidson gave the new model a four-inch instrument panel mounted on the handlebar riser, and it now has a digital speedometer and an analog tachometer to make it easier to glance at all the necessary information without taking your eyes completely off the road ahead.\nMeanwhile, the mid-mounted foot pegs and moto handlebars mounted to four-inch risers enable an upright, straight-backed riding stance. The new Low Rider S also has an inverted fork (with a triple-rate spring) and a taller rear coil-over mono shock with a 56 mm stroke that unlocks slightly more ground clearance and an increased lean angle (about 1.2 degrees more).\nThe anchors consist of dual four-piston front and two-piston rear calipers that grab on seven-spoke floating rotors. The Harley Low Rider S also comes standard with anti-lock braking, traction control, LED high/low beam headlights, and an LED Zeppelin (get it?) taillight design."

      "text": "Everything You Need To Know About The 2024 Harley-Davidson Street Bob 114\nHarley-Davidson is primarily known for building big, heavy cruisers but there are a number of lighter and more maneuverable bikes in the manufacturer's catalog as well. One that has been pulling a lot of eyes is the 2024 Street Bob 114. This is a tighter, more nimble design that blurs the line between cruiser and street bike. It has a stripped-down look that gives it the classic appeal of old caf\u00e9 racers while simultaneously maintaining a uniquely American feel. This makes it one of the top Harley-Davidson models that are perfectly suited for city cruising.\nMake no mistake though. The bike may be more compact in its design, but it still has plenty of get-up-and-go. This easy rideability is one of many reasons why the Street Bob if often considered one of the best Harley-Davidson cruisers for beginners. There is a lot to consider when looking at a bike like this. You need to think about the power of the engine, the features present in the design, how independent reviewers feel about its performance, and how much it will cost to get your hands on one. Weighing all of this information will give you a much better idea of what kind of bike you're dealing with. Here is everything you need to know about the Harley-Davidson Street Bob 114.\nWhat kind of engine does the Street Bob 114 have?\nThe Street Bob 114 comes equipped with a Milwaukee-Eight 114. This engine was launched in 2017 and is the ninth installation in the Harley-Davidson Big Twin line. It's the same engine that has been used in a majority of Harley's recent touring motorcycles and trikes. According to Harley-Davidson's press release from when the engine first launched, it offered \"quicker throttle response, more passing power, purer sound, a smoother ride and more of the feeling riders want from a Harley-Davidson Touring motorcycle engine.\"\nThe Milwaukee-Eight 114 is a 114 CID, 1870cc, 45-degree V-twin with a 4.016\" bore and a 4.5\" stroke. It has eight valves, two cylinders, and a compression ratio of 10.5:1. \"The Milwaukee-Eight 114 accelerates 8 percent quicker 0-60 and 12 percent quicker 60-80 than the Twin Cam 110\" according to Harley-Davidson.\nOn the 2024 Street Bob 114, the Milwaukee-Eight 114 provides 94 horsepower at 4750 RPM and 119 ft. lbs. of torque. The bike gets an estimated 47 MPG across city and highway testing. All of this adds up to a bike that is both powerful and efficient. With the Milwaukee-Eight 114 at the core of its performance, riders should have little issue getting the power they need.\nWhat features does the Street Bob 114 have in its design?\nThe frame has a sleek Softail design, but with a more lightweight build that places the rider in a more upright seating position with mid-mounted foot controls. The body is 91.3\" in length, with a 25.8\" seat height and 4.9\" of ground clearance. It has a second set of pegs and a pillion, just in case you want to bring a passenger along as well.\nThe bike has a 2-into-2 offset shotgun exhaust, a 34/46 ratio primary drive chain, dual-bending valve 49 mm telescopic front forks, concealed, free piston, and coil-over monoshock rear shocks. The bike has a 5 qt. oil capacity, and the fuel tank has a 3.5 gal. capacity.\nIn terms of electronics, the high beams and low beams are both LEDs while the turn signals and taillights are both incandescent bulbs. The bike comes with a 2.14-inch LCD display with serves as a gauge cluster. Those who are purchasing the bike new also have the option to add an anti-lock brake system, though it doesn't come standard.\nHow does the Street Bob 114 perform?\nThe next thing to look at is the Street Bob 114's performance metrics and how reviewers have found it to stand up in real world conditions. The bike has a 28.5-degree lean angle on both sides and we've already covered its considerable horsepower and torque, which was tested under SAE J1349 certification conditions.\nThere haven't been many in-depth reviews of the 2024 model just yet, but the YouTuber Mr. XR gave a first ride review where he took the '24 Street Bob 114 out for a spin and gave his thoughts. He loved the design, though he found the digital sash to be a bit subpar. \"The Street Bob is an awesome bike,\" he said. He describes the overall riding experience as fun with a nice low-end rumble and great handling. He commented that the price was a bit high, but that he was very impressed with the engine. He mentioned that it was a simple bike without a lot of modern touches, but that it sounds amazing and really felt like a quintessential Harley.\nHow much does the Street Bob 114 cost?\nThe hardest pill to swallow when it comes to the Street Bob 114 is probably going to be the price. Harley-Davidsons aren't exactly cheap motorcycles and this one is no exception. The bike starts at $16,999. The starting price is for the stock Billiard Gray version. The Vivid black costs an additional $350, the Baja Orange costs and additional $525, and the Blue Burst costs an additional $650. Those who wish to include the optional anti-lock break system will also have to pay an additional fee.\nThat's definitely not cheap. Japanese small-form cruisers are significantly cheaper, like the Kawasaki Vulcan S which starts at $7,349. The UK based Triumph Bonneville Bobber is also cheaper at $13,995. Even fellow the fellow American 2024 Indian Chief shaves off a couple grand at $14,999 while the Scout Bobber is even cheaper at $12,999.\nThat said, these aren't exactly one-to-one comparisons. The Milwaukee-Eight 114 engine is more powerful than those found in most bobbers and you can't discount the value of Harley's reputation for build quality and reliability. This is why the Street Bob is often considered one of the best bobber-style motorcycles you can buy."

      "text": "Harley-Davidson Cruiser Vs. Touring Motorcycles: What's The Difference?\nWhether you've finally decided to get yourself a Harley, or your interest in the company's bikes has only just been piqued, there's a lot information out there, and it can be hard to figure out what's what. Harley-Davidson has a long complicated history, and with age comes a long list of magnificent products sure to make any motorcycle lover's mouth water. From Sportsters like the 883 and 1200, ideal starting points for anyone looking to get into Harleys, and Softails like the Fat Boy, which you might have seen in \"Terminator 2: Judgement Day,\" to the Street Glide, perfect for seasoned bikers who have confidence in their riding skills, the list might seem endless and equally confusing.\nA good starting point is usually understanding Harley's motorcycle types, two of which are the cruisers and tourers. You might have heard someone refer to a Fat Boy as a cruiser or the Street Glide as a tourer, but what exactly does that all mean? It all comes down to the bike's intended use. Cruisers are designed for relatively short rides around cities and similar areas, while tourers are better suited for long-distance riding \u2014 think your cross-state ride packed with long highways, meandering downhill roads, and picturesque countrysides. This difference in use often dictates the kind of gear and equipment these bikes come with, which in turn, further specializes them in their unique niches. Let's do a deep dive into these two bike types, pit them against each other, and see how they fare.\nEvery Harley-Davidson cruiser uses a Milwaukee-Eight 117 engine\nHarley-Davidson cruisers will likely be the most prevalent type of Harley you'll encounter on the road, considering the collection's diversity and their prices compared to tourers. These bikes feature the Softail chassis, famously introduced with the 1983 FXST Softail, and are recognized for their smooth ride, thanks to the hidden rear suspension, one of the chassis's most iconic features. Today, Harley-Davidson fits these motorcycles with three versions of its Milwaukee-Eight 117 engine, a motor rated at 98 hp, 104 hp, and 114 hp, depending on the variant (Classic, Custom, or High Output). The bikes feature a variety of styles, ranging from the bulky yet timelessly classic Fat Boy to the sportier-looking Low Rider S. They are also known for their lightweight design and nimble handling.\nOn the other hand, the Harley tourers, visibly larger than their cruiser counterparts, embody the spirit of priceless Americana. These behemoths are designed for comfort on the road and equipped with features like two-up seating, luggage racks, fairings, windshields, and onboard entertainment systems. Models such as the 2025 Street Glide Ultra feature heated grips and saddlebag guards, while others, like the racetrack-inspired 2025 CVO Road Glide ST, come with lightweight carbon-fiber parts and a powerful 127 hp Milwaukee-Eight 121 High Output V-twin engine, making it a formidable presence on any stretch of asphalt it encounters.\nTourers are more expensive than cruisers\nTouring Harleys also feature the Harley-Davidson touring chassis. Engine options include a powerful V-twin engine capable of producing 105 hp, the Milwaukee-Eight 114 rated at 95 hp, a liquid-cooled Milwaukee-Eight 117 generating 105 hp, a Milwaukee-Eight VVT 121 rated at 115 hp, and the aforementioned Milwaukee-Eight 121 High Output V-twin motor. Interestingly, Harley also has the CVO Road Glide RR, which is rated at a whopping 150 hp. Only 131 of the bikes exist today.\nAs you can see, some tourers offer more power than cruisers. They also have additional features designed to alleviate the discomfort of long rides. However, they are also much more expensive than cruisers. The cheapest cruiser, the Street Bob, starts at $17,199, while the most costly bike in the lineup, the Low Rider ST, begins at an MSRP of $24,199. On the other hand, the Road King Special, the least expensive tourer, starts at $25,749. The CVO Street Glide and CVO Road Glide, which are among the priciest tourers, have a starting price of $45,999."
