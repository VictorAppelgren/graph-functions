  "content": "British Foreign Secretary David Lammy went fishing with U.S. Vice President JD Vance earlier this month and the closest thing he came to catching was a whopping fine.\n\nLammy was given a written warning for fishing without a license, an Environment Agency spokesperson said Friday.\n\nAs far as breaking the law goes, it was pretty small fry but could have netted him a fine of up to 2,500 pounds ($3,380) for the offense.\n\nLammy, whose spokesperson described it all as an \u201cadministrative oversight,\u201d purchased a license after-the-fact and reported himself to the agency.\n\nLammy hosted Vance and his family, who were vacationing in England, at his country estate south of London on Aug. 8. The two men smiled and laughed as Vance provided what Lammy called Kentucky-style fishing tips.\n\n\u201cThe one strain on the special relationship is that all of my kids caught fish, but the foreign secretary did not,\u201d Vance later said.\n\nThe Environment Agency would not comment on whether Vance had a license, citing data protection rules. The vice president\u2019s spokesperson did not immediately reply to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nThe agency said it confirmed that Lammy was given a warning because he had publicized it. In England and Wales, anyone over 13 needs a license for freshwater fishing, the agency said.\n\nIn most cases, inexperienced anglers caught without a permit are given warnings \u2014 so in that sense, Lammy apparently had some beginner\u2019s luck.",
