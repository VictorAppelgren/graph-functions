      "feedback": "The draft nails a coherent three-regime framing and ties macro policy, flows/positioning, and AI/valuation impulses into a plausible transmission, but it needs a tighter, first-principles causal chain, clearer horizon formatting, and explicit, testable triggers; actionable edits: (1) crystallize a minimal first-principles chain—policy stance (tariffs, regime shifts) shapes inflation and real rates, which drives discount-rate/risk-premia dynamics, which then reprices equities/AI infra and credit; tie every link to a concrete mechanism (e.g., tariff pass-through, wage-growth momentum, capex cadence, and their quantified channel to P/E/EV/ROIC). (2) Reframe into Base Case plus explicit transitions with named triggers rather than a single prose arc; assign regime priors and show sensitivity (e.g., Regime A probability range vs Regime B/C) and a clear invalidation rule (e.g., wage-growth acceleration > X% annualized or a tariff spike > Y%). (3) Quantify with consistent numbers and units drawn from sources, and attach a citation to every factual claim; resolve inconsistencies (e.g., oil regime probabilities and 2025/26 supply/demand deltas) by presenting a single, source-backed range rather than multiple conflicting statements. (4) Cleanly separate the cross‑topic channels (policy/flows/valuation) and add explicit mechanics: how AI momentum and semis capex feed productivity, how that interacts with cost of capital, and how that shifts risk premia into S&P 500 pricing; ensure numeric anchors (e.g., tariff baseline ~10%, episodic spikes to 145%, 2025 oil supply deltas, 0.30–0.40% MoM core CPI path) are consistently attributed to IDs SGB2PAZGK, OGK8WLL69, T1QE6JPIX, J99EM2TPZ, Y6SQOEK69, NL5YYTLF2, R3WNA7L7A, STBVARD8F, 22PL3Q360. (5) Tighten formatting and reduce duplication: use Regime A/B/C and 2025/2026 horizons consistently, remove repeated citations, and avoid mixing concepts (e.g., “Regime I” vs “Regime A”). (6) Add a concise 5–6 item watch-list of decisive signals with lead times (Jackson Hole policy tone, semiconductor capex cadence, Nvidia AI momentum, tariff-shock risks, oil-supply surprises, CPI momentum trajectory), plus a one‑line invalidation note for each. (7) Demote generic statements to quantified claims and note confidence bands; (8) run a quick reconciliation pass across all critical sources to ensure coverage and resolve conflicts, then deliver a compact two‑section narrative (Base Case with pathway and a 1‑page watch-list) rather than a long unified paragraph. This will elevate depth, measurability, and credibility while preserving the intended cross-topic synthesis.",
