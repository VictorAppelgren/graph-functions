      "feedback": "Your draft mixes several unrelated themes and lacks a clear causal chain. To reach world‑class quality, first isolate a single investment thesis (e.g., automotive or pharma) and build a 3‑6‑month scenario map: base case, upside, downside. Quantify each link—cite the Texas tax cut as $3,942 (9LQ0QNPWD), note the 8 % rise in disposable income, project a 2 % lift in durable‑goods sales, and tie that to RAV4 sales growth (H8880U45S). For gaming laptops, use the Alienware m16 R2 specs (U0I2AFHOV) and link to Dell/ MSI revenue trends. For dividends, list yields and FCF data from WISLWAJ15 and explain payout sustainability. Add macro anchors: Fed rate at 5 % (cite a recent Fed statement), inflation at 3.5 % (cite CPI), and consumer confidence index. Define triggers (Fed hike, soybean price spike, Pfizer earnings drop) and watch signals (10‑bp Fed change, 5 % soybean jump, 2 % Pfizer earnings decline). Justify your 70 % confidence with a brief risk‑reward assessment. Ensure every claim has a source ID, avoid generic statements, and reconcile the tax‑cut benefit vs. social‑spending cuts for low‑income households. Finally, trim the draft to 1–2 paragraphs, keeping the focus tight and the citations dense.",
