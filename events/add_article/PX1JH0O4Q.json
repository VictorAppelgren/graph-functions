      "summary": "Fusion startups have attracted over $7.1 billion in private capital, with Commonwealth Fusion Systems leading at nearly $3 billion and Helion, TAE Technologies, Pacific Fusion, and others following. Advances in high‑temperature superconductors, AI‑driven simulations, and powerful magnets have accelerated progress, moving several companies toward scientific breakeven and commercial‑scale prototypes. Key milestones include CFS’s Sparc tokamak, Helion’s Polaris reactor, and General Fusion’s LM26, while investors such as Google, Bill Gates, and Breakthrough Energy continue to back the sector. The industry’s rapid funding and technological breakthroughs suggest a growing path toward commercial fusion power within the next decade, though significant technical and financial hurdles remain.",
