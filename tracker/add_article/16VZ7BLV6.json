      "summary": "US equity futures slipped into a fifth‑day sell‑off as traders awaited the Jackson Hole symposium, with the S&P 500 futures down 0.2% and Nasdaq flat after a two‑day decline.  Tech names led losses, while Nvidia rose modestly; Walmart’s Q2 earnings miss and higher guidance failed to lift the stock.  European markets mirrored the downturn, erasing a three‑day rally, and U.S. Treasury yields rose to 4.31% on a backdrop of hawkish Fed minutes and growing concerns over Fed independence.  Commodities were mixed, with Brent climbing to a two‑week high, and geopolitical tensions over Ukraine and Russia added to market uncertainty.",
