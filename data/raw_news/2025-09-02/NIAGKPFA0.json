  "description": "Key PointsMain Street Capital pays a bankable monthly dividend.",
  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None The BDC also periodically pays supplemental quarterly dividends.\n\u2022 None The company offers additional upside potential from its equity investments.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Main Street Capital \u203a\n\nMy primary financial goal is to build enough passive income streams to cover my basic living expenses. Achieving this milestone would enable me to be more financially independent. This strategy leads me to invest money each month to grow my passive income.\n\nInvesting in high-yielding dividend stocks is a core aspect of my strategy. I tend to buy several each month. However, if I could only buy one high-yield dividend stock this month, it would be Main Street Capital (NYSE: MAIN). Here's why it's my top passive income investment in September.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nMain Street Capital is a business development company (BDC) that provides private debt and equity capital to lower-middle-market companies ($10 million\u2013$150 million in annual revenue) and debt capital to middle-market companies (over $150 million in revenue). These investments generate recurring income.\n\nThe BDC distributes a portion of its income to investors each month through dividend payments. Main Street Capital sets its monthly dividend at a level it can sustain during more turbulent market conditions (currently 1.4 times its distributable net investment income). That enables it to provide investors with a recurring income stream they can count on each month.\n\nMain Street Capital has never reduced or suspended its dividend payment since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2007. This bankability is a desirable feature for those seeking a durable passive income stream.\n\nMain Street Capital currently pays $0.255 per share each month ($3.06 annually). That gives the BDC a 4.6% dividend yield, nearly four times higher than the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 1.2% yield.\n\nThe BDC routinely increases its monthly dividend, aiming to grow it at a sustainable rate. Since its IPO, Main Street Capital has increased its payout by 132%, including by 4.1% over the past 12 months. This steadily rising payout provides its investors with a growing stream of passive income.\n\nAs a BDC, Main Street Capital must distribute 90% of its taxable net income to investors via dividends to remain compliant with IRS regulations. The company does this through a unique dividend policy. It pays the aforementioned conservative monthly dividend. Additionally, Main Street Capital periodically pays quarterly supplemental dividends from its excess income.\n\nIt recently declared a $0.30 per-share supplemental dividend payment that it will pay in September. The company has paid quarterly supplemental dividends at that rate for the past two years. This additional payment has pushed Main Street Capital's annualized dividend yield up to around 6.5%, even further above the S&P 500's level.\n\nThe company has historically paid supplemental dividends during healthy market conditions and pauses these payments during more challenging periods to preserve its financial flexibility. I see this additional dividend payment as a nice bonus income stream.\n\nAnother bonus Main Street Capital provides its investors is the potential for meaningful value growth. Most BDCs focus on making debt investments. While that provides them with a lucrative income stream to pay dividends, it caps their upside potential.\n\nMain Street Capital, on the other hand, aims to be a one-stop capital solutions provider by offering its clients debt and equity capital. Those equity investments (30% of its lower-middle-market portfolio, and 5% of its middle-market investments) supply it with dividend income and upside potential as the value of its private equity investments increases.\n\nThese equity investments have enabled Main Street Capital to meaningfully grow its net asset value per share (151% since its IPO). That has provided investors with an additional return above the dividend income. Main Street can periodically harvest gains by selling its equity investments, which it can use to make additional investments. These investments have enabled the company to steadily increase its dividend payments.\n\nMain Street Capital is an ideal investment for my passive income strategy. It provides a very bankable monthly income stream that steadily rises. Additionally, it routinely pays a supplemental dividend, supplying even more passive income. To top it all off, the company's equity investments have helped steadily grow the value of its shares, providing additional upside potential beyond the lucrative income.\n\nThis combination of income and upside potential is why Main Street Capital is the high-yield dividend stock I'd buy if I could only purchase one this September.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Main Street Capital right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Main Street Capital, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Main Street Capital wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $651,599!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,067,639!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,049% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500.

      "text": "Imagine if you could earn money simply by sitting back and doing nothing. Believe it or not, it's something countless folks do every day. That money you earn with little to no effort is known as passive income, and it puts you on the fast track to financial independence.\nEarning money without working for it may sound too good to be true, and there is a catch. Passive income doesn't materialize on its own; it requires an up-front investment of money and time. The first step to accessing passive income is buying, creating, or contributing to assets that produce cash flow. If all goes as planned, your reward for that initial investment is an ongoing stream of income you can enjoy over time.\nKeep in mind that the IRS has a narrower definition of income from passive activities. For the purposes of your tax return, special tax rules apply if the income is derived from equipment leasing, rental properties, or a business you don't materially participate in.\nCash Flow\nBenefits of passive income\nBenefits of passive income\nPassive income is a critical element of financial independence. Compare passive income to the money you earn in a paycheck, and you can see why.\nYour work income depends on you showing up and performing tasks every day. It's limited in many ways -- by the hours in the day, your health, your age, your company's policies on raises and promotions, and even your boss's perception of your performance. Even when you're healthy and capable of working, there's a ceiling to how much you can earn. And, if your health fails, your paycheck potential takes a dive, too.\nPassive income doesn't have those limitations. You can earn passively at any age and in any health condition. A larger stream of passive income makes you less reliant on your paycheck and gives you more freedom to choose how you spend your time. Passive income can fund big financial goals, like retirement, or smaller ones, like debt repayment.\nTypes of passive income\nTypes of passive income\nAs noted above, you can build a passive income stream by buying, creating, or contributing to an asset that generates cash.\n- Buy: Passive income investments include dividend stocks, bonds, annuities, and rental properties. You could also buy a small business.\n- Create: You can develop a product or service that generates cash.\n- Contribute: You can invest in an existing business or a limited partnership. You could also make an asset you already own available for sale or lease. Renting out a room in your house is one example.\nWhere should I invest to create passive income?\nWhere should I invest to create passive income?\nThe easiest place to start investing for passive income is in a standard brokerage account. You can access a variety of income-producing securities, including stocks and bonds or dividend-paying mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and real estate investment trusts (REITs).\nWhile investing in an individual retirement account, such as a traditional IRA, has the advantage of tax-deferred investment earnings, in a taxable account you'll pay taxes on that income even if you reinvest it.\nYou could also invest in rental properties or business ventures directly.\n3 popular ways to make passive income\n3 popular ways to make passive income\nPopular passive income strategies fall into three general categories:\n- Traditional income investments: Fixed-income and dividend-paying securities are popular sources of passive income because they require very little work. You do the research up front, keep watch over your investment portfolio, and collect your payments. If you don't need the cash flow right away, you can reinvest those dividend or interest payments to expedite your income growth.\n- Rental properties: Owning real estate for rental income is also appealing because you can finance the property inexpensively with a mortgage. Also, the property's value isn't as volatile as stocks. The trade-off is that real estate passive income is often less passive than you'd think. Unless you hire a property manager, you will be coordinating maintenance and repairs, fielding tenant questions, and collecting rents.\n- Online businesses. Those who are short on cash often look to launch a small business that will eventually produce passive income. There are many opportunities in the digital space, from e-commerce stores that drop-ship products to blogs and online courses. This is a longer-term strategy since these businesses are often resource-intensive at the beginning.\nDoes passive income really require \"no work\"?\nDoes passive income really require \"no work\"?\nPassive income does require work. However, much of that work is done at the start so you can enjoy the cash flows later with less effort. The amount of work involved varies based on the passive income strategy you pursue.\nInvest in a reputable dividend stock, and you don't have to do much at all. Just oversee your position, and you might collect a 2% or 3% yield on your investment for many years.\nAs you pursue higher yields, the amount of work can increase. You could invest in a high-yield income fund that uses leverage and other aggressive tactics to amplify returns, for example. That's a position you'd have to manage closely since it will probably be quite sensitive to market and economic trends.\nA small-business launch, which could have unlimited return potential, typically requires even more time and energy. You could put in full-time hours for months before the business is stable enough for you to step back from the front lines.\nResidual Income\nHow do I pay taxes on passive income?\nHow do I pay taxes on passive income?\nThis probably won't surprise you: The taxation of passive income is confusing. There are several sets of rules and exceptions that apply, depending on the exact nature of the income.\nFor example, ordinary dividends are taxed as ordinary income, but qualified dividends are taxed at long-term capital gains rates. Rental income from real estate properties is also taxed as ordinary income, but you can deduct your mortgage interest and other expenses as well as depreciation. Income from a business you manage is often subject to ordinary income tax, plus self-employment tax.\nThere is also a special set of rules governing the tax treatment of losses on passive activities. This is where the IRS definition of \"passive\" comes into play. The short story is that losses from passive activities cannot offset your ordinary income. You either need to carry those losses forward or offset them with passive income in the same tax year. This only applies if your income comes from real estate rentals, equipment leasing, or a business you're invested in but don't materially participate in.\nRelated Investing Topics\nYour ticket to financial freedom\nPassive income is your ticket to financial freedom. Have enough of it and you can do what you want with your time and still pay your bills, too."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "Net asset value (NAV) is a financial calculation showcasing the value of an investment fund's assets minus any liabilities. Funds often calculate NAV on a per-share basis. They use NAV to report changes in equity value to investors and as the market value for selling or repurchasing shares. Learn more here about NAV -- its definition, a formula for calculating NAV, how it's used, and an example.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is meant by net asset value?\nNet asset value, or NAV, is an investment fund's total assets minus its total liabilities. It's often expressed on a per-share basis by dividing NAV by the total outstanding shares. NAV shows investors the current market value of an investment fund's net assets, which might differ from its current share price.\nOutstanding Shares\nNAV is very similar to a company's book value, which is also its total assets minus liabilities. Investment funds tend to use NAV, while corporations will use book value.\nFormula\nWhat is the formula for net asset value?\nNet asset value is relatively easy to calculate. The NAV formula is: NAV = Total Assets \u2013 Total Liabilities.\nFor example, if an investment fund has $100 million in total assets and $50 million in total liabilities, its NAV would be $50 million ($100 million \u2013 $50 million = $50 million).\nMany investment funds also showcase their NAV on a per-share basis. The NAV per share formula is: NAV/Total outstanding shares.\nFor example, if that same investment fund had 5 million outstanding shares, its NAV per share would be $10 ($50 million/5 million=$10).\nHow is it used?\nHow do investment funds use net asset value?\nVarious investment funds, such as mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and real estate trust funds (REITS), use NAV to report the fund's equity value to investors. They also use NAV as a basis for the price at which they sell shares to investors or repurchase them.\nMutual funds report NAV at the end of each trading day. The fund's manager uses the closing price of all the securities within the fund. It then subtracts liabilities and divides the NAV by its outstanding shares. Mutual funds use NAV as the value at which they sell shares to investors.\nETFs also use NAV. However, because they trade like stocks, their market value can differ from their NAV. Shares can sell at a premium to the fund's NAV if investors bid up the share price or a discount if they sell them off. Investors should consider an ETF's NAV before buying shares to ensure they aren't paying a significant premium to NAV for the shares.\nMany non-traded REITs use NAV to calculate the net value of their real estate assets. These REITs will also use NAV as the value for selling additional shares to investors or for share redemptions.\nRelated investing topics\nExample\nAn example of net asset value\nMany investment funds use NAV as the market price for selling additional shares to investors and for redemptions. A notable example is Blackstone's (BX -0.25%) non-traded REIT, Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT). In mid-2023, the leading non-traded REIT owned more than 5,000 properties worth $122 billion. After subtracting liabilities, its NAV was $68 billion (and $14.58 per Class S share). Investors can buy shares at that price (less any selling commission). They can also redeem their shares at the previous month's NAV price (or 98% of NAV for shares held less than a year). However, Blackstone limits repurchases to 2% of NAV each month and 5% per quarter."

      "text": "A business development company (BDC) is a specific corporate structure for companies that provide capital to smaller and midsize companies, as well as distressed businesses in need of capital. Publicly traded BDCs can be compelling investments, as they give investors of any level of wealth access to strategies like investing in private equity and distressed debt, which are more often associated with the well-heeled.\nIn addition, BDCs appeal to investors seeking a source of income or a good dividend yield. Because of their structure, they are required to distribute 90% of taxable income to shareholders each year. The downside is that the BDC doesn't retain much of its earnings, so these large distributions can fluctuate from year to year.\nWhat is a BDC?\nWhat is a BDC?\nAt its core, a business development company (BDC) invests in private companies, typically small- and medium-sized ones, to provide them with the capital they may need to grow during their early stages of development. Some BDCs also provide capital to larger companies that may be distressed and in need of cash to turn the business around or avoid insolvency.\nThe capital that a BDC provides may be structured as debt, often secured by the business or particular assets it owns. Alternatively, it can be issued as equity or as debt that can be converted to an equity investment. Depending on the size and condition of the business, these strategies are often unattainable to individual investors. They can be structured to reduce the risk of loss for the BDC and its investors, even in the case of a business failure.\nA BDC's offerings and/or shares are registered with and regulated by the SEC, subject to many of the regulations applicable to registered investment companies. BDCs are a type of closed-end fund, meaning they invest the money raised during their IPO and don't take in new money from investors.\nA BDC must be a U.S. company. Additionally, it must invest at least 70% of its assets in U.S. companies with a market value of less than $250 million. In addition to capital, BDCs also provide assistance in the form of expertise in managing their companies as well.\nPros and cons\nPros and cons of investing in a BDC\nAs mentioned above, BDCs can be very compelling income investments. Because they pay no income tax so long as they distribute 90% of their taxable income, the average BDC pays a very high dividend yield compared to the majority of dividend-paying stocks.\nAnother benefit of BDCs for retail investors is they are highly liquid; it's easy to buy and sell shares on securities exchanges. By contrast, typical private equity and venture capital investments require your funds to be locked up for many years at a time.\nLastly, there's a diversification benefit. So long as the BDC you invest in owns a diverse portfolio of investments, it's a nice way to spread your capital across multiple opportunities and risks at one time.\nHowever, there are downsides, too. Those dividends can sometimes come at the cost of lower stock price appreciation. Most BDCs must distribute 90% of income, meaning they have far less retained earnings to reinvest and grow the value of the enterprise. And since most BDCs don't pay income tax, their distributions are not qualified. That means you will likely pay more in taxes on the distributions you get from the BDCs you own.\nThe result of paying out most of its earnings while still pursuing growth means most BDCs have a lot of debt as a percentage of assets. This means rising debt expense as they must refinance debt as it matures. This environment means potential risk and opportunity for BDCs now. Since interest rates have moved sharply higher, BDCs can potentially strike more lucrative new deals, but they could also be handcuffed by existing agreements that tie up their capital. And if portfolio companies struggle to repay their debts, a BDC could end up owning its assets and disposing of them at a loss.\nAnother potential issue with BDCs is fees. Just like with an open-ended fund like a mutual fund or ETF, the manager of the BDC will charge fees to cover its expenses, and these fees can be significant. According to Closed-End Fund Advisors, the 48 average publicly traded BDC had an expense ratio of 14.28% as of July 2023. In other words, access to these lucrative strategies comes with a significant cost.\nExpense Ratio\nInvesting in a BDC\nWhat to know about investing in a BDC\nBecause business development companies pay out almost all of their taxable income and use a lot of debt to fund deals, investors need to be familiar with their balance sheets and capital structures. It's important to know their interest rate on debt, when debt is maturing, and how much of a discount to current market rates it may be paying. This is especially true if it must refinance cheap debt at higher rates, while still earning subpar yields on existing debt from portfolio companies.\nIt's also really important to understand the strategy of the BDCs you are interested in. Some focus on specific sorts of companies or sectors or industries. The majority of the largest BDCs focus on debt opportunities and less equity. Make sure that the strategy the BDC's management takes aligns with you as an investor.\nLastly, make sure you know how a BDC's management is compensated. Does the manager get an outsize portion of returns above a certain threshold? It's not uncommon for the BDC's manager to take a \"2 and 20\" fee structure, meaning 2% of assets and 20% of profits earned. These fees come right off the top, before you get anything at all.\nMany BDCs are entities created by a larger company. For instance, FS KKR Capital Corp (FSK 1.39%) was formed in a merger of entities managed by privately held FS Investments and a subsidiary of KKR & Co. (KKR -0.34%) and Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (BXSL 0.57%) is managed by Blackstone (BX -0.25%), the largest alternative asset manager on earth.\nLastly, valuation matters. With BDCs, net asset value (NAV) is a useful way to find fair value. NAV is the value of the underlying assets that a business development company owns. Shares may trade for a discount or a premium to NAV, and there are reasons why you would want to pay more or less than NAV, depending on the market value of those assets. A BDC that made a risky investment in a business that goes poorly may be worth less than NAV. Conversely, a wildly successful investment could cause it to be worth a premium. Either way, NAV is a useful starting point to valuation.\nThe largest publicly traded BDCs\nThe largest publicly traded business development companies (BDCs)\nAccording to Closed-End Fund Advisors, there were 48 publicly traded BDCs as of July 11, 2023. While a few of them have been around for many years, the vast majority came into existence or went public 2004 and later.\nFor the most part, these remain relatively small, with an average market capitalization of $5.8 billion. The largest focus on debt, carrying an average market cap of $6.5 billion, compared to a tiny $40.6 million market cap for equity-focused BDCs.\nOf this group, here are the six largest, by total assets.\n| BDC Name | Trailing Dividend Yield | Total Assets | Market Cap |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Ares Capital Corp (NYSE:ARCC) | 8.7% | $21.8B | $10.5B |\n| Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (NYSE:BXSL) | 9.5% | $9.85B | $4.4B |\n| Blue Owl Capital Corp (NYSE:OBDC) | 9.6% | $13.7B | $5.4B |\n| FS KKR Capital Corp (NYSE:FSK) | 13.4% | $16.1B | $5.5B |\n| Main Street Capital Corp (NYSE:MAIN) | 7.6% | $4.3B | $3.25B |\n| Prospect Capital Corp (NYSE:PSEC) | 10.2% | $7.7B | $2.6B |"

      "text": "Money for nothing \u2014 what could be better? That's the optimistic promise of passive income. Passive income is money you earn with minimal regular effort.\nWhile most passive income sources will require some investment in time or money up front, that hurdle can be worth it. Once you get your passive income stream rolling, you have a source of cash that's not tied to your boss or your timecard. It could even grow into a business that allows you to quit the daily grind and achieve financial independence.\nHere's a closer look at 11 smart passive income ideas divided into four categories: easy, most profitable, online, and low-investment ideas for students.\nEasy ideas\nEasy passive income ideas\n1. Dividend investing\nAs a dividend investor, you purchase stocks that share earnings with shareholders by way of dividend payments.\nDividend investing is a top passive income idea because it's low effort. You'll do some research up front to pick your stocks and then monitor them over time. That's it \u2014 no hustling or sales involved. Your dividends are deposited to your brokerage account automatically.\nDownsides and risk. Dividend yields for quality stocks are modest, about 2% of the stock price. You can find stocks that pay higher yields, but those usually come with more risk. Also, dividends are not guaranteed. The company can cancel or lower the payment at any time, or the stock price could drop and reduce the value of your investment.\nGetting started. Open a brokerage account and start researching how to invest in dividend-paying companies. Learn some metrics, such as the dividend payout ratio, to help you assess the company's ability to keep paying its dividend.\n2. REITs\nREITs, or real estate investment trusts, are companies that buy and rent commercial properties. Like stocks, many REITs are publicly traded. Also like stocks, REITs don't require much effort besides research and monitoring. And, because the IRS requires REITs to pay out 90% of their taxable income to shareholders, they can yield more than dividend stocks.\nDownsides and risk. REIT earnings are taxed as ordinary income, which is higher than the long-term capital gains rates used for most dividend income. Also, REITs fluctuate in value and profitability \u2014 meaning you could lose money on your investment.\nGetting started. Open a brokerage account and start researching REIT funds. REIT funds invest in a diversified collection of REITs, which is less risky than owning a single REIT.\n3. Bond investing\nBonds are loans to corporations or government entities that are sliced up into units and sold to investors. When you invest in a bond, you put up funds and the borrower repays those funds with interest over time.\nDownsides and risk. The borrower could go out of business or stop repaying the loan. Market interest rates could rise so that your bond's rate is less than what you could earn elsewhere.\nGetting started. The simplest way to get into bond investing is to buy a bond exchange-traded fund (ETF) from your brokerage account. A bond ETF provides exposure to corporate or government bonds of varying maturities, which is safer than funding just one bond or one type of bond.\nMost profitable ideas\nMost profitable passive income ideas\n4. Rental property\nRental property investors buy homes, usually with a loan, and then rent those homes to long-term tenants. The trick is to make sure the rents you collect cover the mortgage payment, property taxes, maintenance costs, and any other expenses \u2014 while leaving a nice chunk of profit for you. Ideally, you'll profit on the rents, plus your property should appreciate over time.\nDownsides and risk. You can fall behind on the mortgage if your tenants don't pay their rent or the home is vacant. You may incur large maintenance expenses if tenants damage your property.\nGetting started. You need good credit and a cash down payment to get started as a property investor. Review housing prices and home rentals near you. Identify investable neighborhoods and start estimating how much capital you'll need.\n5. Vacation rentals\nRenting your existing home or an investment property to travelers is another passive income option. For properties in popular neighborhoods, vacation rentals command higher nightly rates than residential rentals. They are also a lower commitment. You can customize the property's availability schedule however you want, and most of your visitors will only stay for a few days.\nDownsides and risk. If you are renting an unused room in your existing home, the risks are low. Your renters might be loud or messy, or your room may not generate the rents you expected. Renting an investment property is a different story. As with a long-term rental, you risk default if the property doesn't generate enough income to pay the mortgage plus the other expenses.\nGetting started. Check your homeowner's insurance to see if you need more coverage for short-term rentals. Review properties like yours on vacation rental marketplaces, including Airbnb, HomeToGo, and FlipKey. Then fix up your place, take some pretty photos, and list it.\nOnline ideas\nOnline passive income ideas\n6. Affiliate marketing\nAs an affiliate marketer, you earn commissions for referring people to products and services online. Your referrals are tracked by way of links you publish on your website or social media posts. When someone clicks on your link and buys something, the transaction is credited to you.\nDownsides and risk. Affiliate commissions can often be low, usually 1% to 5% of the sale amount. You may not generate enough transactions to produce a solid revenue stream.\nGetting started. Most affiliate marketers use a website to promote products, but you could also use Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest. Make sure you understand the FTC's disclosure requirements for affiliate marketers. Then join affiliate programs for products you'd like to represent and start promoting.\n7. Dropshipping\nDropshipping is another way to sell products online and without having a warehouse full of inventory. You'd have an online store, either on your own website or on Amazon. Your product catalog would be items you can purchase from wholesalers. When someone places an order, you collect the funds and then order the item directly from the wholesaler at a lower price. The wholesaler ships the product straight to your customer.\nDownsides and risk. As with affiliate marketing, the biggest challenge with dropshipping is generating traffic and sales. A secondary risk is fraudulent transactions. If you fund the purchase with the wholesaler and the customer's payment subsequently fails, you're on the hook.\nGetting started. Find wholesalers that dropship products you can promote. Then set up those products in an online store and start driving traffic to it.\n8. Membership website\nA membership website charges members a monthly fee for access to exclusive content. If you have specialized knowledge, you could build a website to share that knowledge through articles, videos, and other tools. Membership websites also allow members who share an interest in the site's subject matter to connect and interact.\nDownsides and risk. You could spend many hours building a website and developing your exclusive content and then have trouble securing new members. If your content isn't better than what's available online for free, your members will cancel their memberships.\nGetting started. Join a membership site or two to see how they work. Define how your site will be different and ask friends and family for feedback on your idea. Once you've set your direction, start creating content.\n9. Peer-to-peer lending\nIf you have cash on hand, you can make small loans at high interest rates via peer-to-peer lending platforms such as Prosper, LendingClub, and Funding Circle. These are fixed-rate, fixed-payment loans with no collateral. The platform manages the money transfer and repayments, and you are responsible for choosing borrowers and funding the loans. Prosper reports that its loans average a 5.5% annual return.\nDownsides and risk. The risk of default can be high, and you have no collateral to collect if the borrower stops paying. You can mitigate the risk somewhat by diversifying your funds across many small loans.\nGetting started. Review how the different platforms work, including minimum loan amounts and tools available to manage your funds. Choose a platform and start making small loans to test the experience. You can invest more as you gain confidence.\nLow-investment ideas for students\nLow-investment passive income ideas for students\nIf you are a student, you may not have the budget or the time to set up an online store or buy investment property. What you can do, though, is leverage your online network of friends. Here are two passive income ideas \u2014 no cash outlay required \u2014 that use your circle of influence to make money.\n10. Cashback apps\nCashback apps pay rebates when you shop. To earn, you may need to upload receipts or use the app to pay at the retailer. You won't make big money on your own shopping, but you can generate passive income for referring your friends to the app. GetUpside, for example, pays you a commission every time one of your referrals earns cashback.\nDownsides and risk. Most cashback apps have minimum payment thresholds of $5 or $10. If you give up on the app before you reach the threshold, you won't collect your funds.\nGetting started. Download apps such as Ibotta, Fetch, and GetUpside and learn how they work. Pick one app to start using regularly and start sharing your referral link with friends.\n11. Social media brand ambassador\nAs a social media brand ambassador, you earn free products and cash payments for promoting brands in your social media posts. You can connect with brands through influencer platforms such as Activate and BrandBacker.\nDownsides and risk. To make money as an influencer, you need a strong and engaged follower community. You could lose some of that engagement if your feed becomes too promotional. Avoid any brands that require their influencers to buy products.\nGetting started. Join influencer platforms and compare your social metrics to other influencers. Review and apply for brand opportunities that interest you.\nRelated Investing Topics\nMaking passive income work for you\nThe profit potential of a passive income idea often correlates to the size of the up-front investment in time or money. Dividend stocks, for example, can generate tens of thousands in income over time \u2014 but they demand a larger cash outlay to start. On the other hand, cashback apps have lower upside potential but don't require much to get started.\nIf the strategy you can afford today has less potential than you'd like, you could use one passive income stream to fund another. For example, you could take your cashback app earnings and invest them in dividend stocks. That's a long-term play, but it's also a smart move financially. Down the road, you can look at your portfolio and feel good about how you funded it."

      "text": "Dividend yield is a stock's annual dividend payments to shareholders expressed as a percentage of the stock's current price. This number tells you what you can expect in future income from a stock based on the price you could buy it for today, assuming the dividend remains unchanged.\nFor example, if a stock trades for $100 per share today and the company's annualized dividend is $5 per share, the dividend yield is 5%. The formula is: annualized dividend divided by share price equals yield. In this case, $5 divided by $100 equals 5%.\nIt's important to realize that a stock's dividend yield can change over time, either in response to market fluctuations or as a result of dividend increases or decreases by the issuing company. So unlike a bond, the yield on a stock is not set in stone. It's most useful as a metric to help determine if a stock trades for a good valuation, to find stocks that meet your needs for income, and to let you know if a dividend may be in trouble.\nHow to calculate dividend yield from quarterly or monthly dividends\nHow to calculate dividend yield from quarterly or monthly dividends\nMost stocks pay quarterly dividends, some pay monthly, and a few pay semiannually or annually. To determine a stock's dividend yield, you need to annualize the dividend by multiplying the amount of a single payment by the number of payments per year -- 4 for stocks that pay out quarterly and 12 for monthly dividends.\nIf you're looking to collect dividends as often as possible, stocks that pay monthly may be ideal. Most (although not all) monthly payers are REITs, or real estate investment trusts. This category of companies benefits from some tax advantages that allow them -- actually, require them -- to pay above-average dividends.\nOne of the most popular is Realty Income (O 1.07%), which we can use as an example. As of June 2023, the most recent dividend was $0.255 per share, and the share price was near $60. Let's use the formula in the previous section to determine the dividend yield.\nA monthly dividend of $0.255 times 12 equals an annualized dividend of $3.07 (rounded). That $3.07 dividend divided by a share price of $60 equals a dividend yield of 5%.\nIf you're calculating a stock's yield, be careful. Don't just assume that the next dividend payment will be equal to the last. Companies occasionally issue special dividends, and dividends can also get cut. Take the time to research the company and make sure the dividend yield you think a stock will pay matches up with reality.\nRealty Income's dividend, for example, has been increased three times in the past year, and it has a long history of modest, regular increases. Costco (NYSE:COST) also has a history of modest regular increases and also pays a special dividend some years -- but not in others. Make sure you don't include these special dividends in your expected yield when evaluating companies with a history of special dividends; they don't happen every year.\nThe dividend yield shown on many popular financial websites can also be misleading. These sites often report trailing dividend yields, and sometimes they still show a yield that's no longer accurate even after a company has announced a dividend cut.\nTotal return\nTotal return\nDividends are one component of a stock's total rate of return; the other is changes in the share price. Let's say that the $100 stock described above has gone up in value by $10 after a year. So you've gained 10% in appreciation, plus that 5% dividend yield, for a total return of 15%. If you're investing for the long term, be sure to consider a stock's total return potential in addition to the yield. Depending on your investing goals, you could be skipping the best dividend stocks if you're focusing too closely on dividend yield.\nAs an example, let's say that (about six years ago at this writing) you bought stock in AT&T (T 1.19%) in June 2017 instead of Verizon Communications (VZ 0.67%) because its dividend yield was a much higher 7.5% than Verizon's 5% yield.\nSince then, neither has proven to be a great investment. But Verizon has been the better performer, generating 4.62% in total returns, while AT&T has lost 13.3%.\nWhen you look past the dividend yield at the underlying business, both AT&T and Verizon have struggled under the weight of unsuccessful acquisitions and the high costs of deploying 5G to stay competitive. The lesson: A higher yield is not a promise of future income. It can be a warning sign that a company is struggling.\nPros of dividend yields\nPros of dividend yields\nDividend yield is a useful metric when applied appropriately, and when the time is taken to understand whether the company behind the payout is able to keep paying it. Here are a few examples of how dividend yield can be useful.\nIncome investors, or people looking at their investment portfolio as a source of income today, will rely on dividend yield as a starting point when considering which dividend stocks to buy. After all, if you're living off your portfolio, you have a minimum amount of income you need it to produce. If you're in this situation, you may prioritize stocks that pay the higher yield today as long as the business is doing well and its earnings and balance sheet are strong enough to keep the payout safe.\nDividend yield can also be a useful tool to help with valuation. If the dividend yield is significantly different than its historical level or is significantly different from similar companies, it can help inform whether a stock is trading for a better -- or worse -- valuation. It can also serve as a warning sign if the yield is significantly higher than similar companies.\nThe yield is only the starting point; knowing what is happening with a company's operations and cash flows is important to help keep the dividend yield in the proper context.\nCons of dividend yields\nCons of dividend yields\nThe biggest problem with dividend yield is when investors misuse it or rely on it entirely to make their decisions about which stocks to buy and which to ignore. The example of Verizon and AT&T is a case in point. A higher yield doesn't matter if there are risks to the company that pays the dividend. AT&T struggled under billions in debt from multiple acquisitions that went badly, and investors have paid the price.\nFocusing exclusively on dividend yield can also cause investors to miss out on better opportunities.\nHere's another case in point. In 2010, Mastercard's (MA 0.92%) dividend yield was a paltry 0.26%, while competitor American Express's (AXP 1.43%) shares yielded almost 2%. For some investors, Amex's higher yield represented a \"safer\" investment since you could always count on that trickle of income each quarter from dividend payments. Yet over the past 13 years, Mastercard has proven to be the far better investment with 1,940% in total returns, more than 4 times the 419% American Express has delivered.\nMastercard's enormous growth made it one of the best dividend growth stocks over that period, having grown its payout more than 37-fold. Amex has been no slouch, tripling its dividend, but Mastercard's dividend growth has been otherworldly.\nThe lesson here is that focusing too closely on yield can cause you to invest in struggling companies and overlook investments that could do more to boost your total wealth.\nIt's not all about yield\nIt's not all about yield\nWhen shopping for dividend stocks, it's important to keep in mind that a high dividend yield alone doesn't make a stock a great investment. To the contrary, a yield that seems too good to be true very well could be.\nHowever, there are several things you should consider before buying any dividend-paying stocks, including, but not limited to:\n- Dividend growth: Does the company have a strong history of increasing earnings and then rewarding investors with regular dividend increases? A good starting point is the Dividend Achievers, a group of stocks that have increased their dividends for at least 10 consecutive years.\n- Financial strength: Does the company have a reasonable debt load based on its industry and an investment-grade credit rating? Does it have sufficient cash and working capital to ride out an unexpected change in the economy or a downturn in its industry?\n- Dividend stability: Does it have a margin of safety between how much it earns and how much it pays in dividends? The payout ratio, which is the percentage of profits that a company spends on dividends, is a useful way to measure this. This metric is best used over an extended period, not just a single quarter or even a year, and it can be augmented with the cash payout ratio since there are many non-cash expenses that can affect a company's net income going by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n- Competitive advantages: How does the company continually beat its competitors or keep them at bay? A cost advantage, the network effect, and a brand that people will pay a premium for are some examples of durable competitive advantages, sometimes called economic moats.\n- Growth prospects: Is the company in an industry that is growing quickly or is demand for its products or services shrinking? Even the best company in a declining industry may find it harder to maintain (much less increase) its dividend over time, unless it can consistently take more market share.\n- Dividend traps: High yields aren't bad, but, in some cases, they are a sign of trouble. Certain industries tend to pay high yields, including REITs, as well as utilities, refiners, and pipeline operators that may have low growth prospects. But if a stock's dividend yield is far higher than those of its nearest competitors or peer companies, that could indicate a dividend yield trap or value trap, meaning a company whose yield looks high because the stock price has fallen and there's a good probability that the dividend payout is going to get cut.\nRelated dividend stocks topics\nRelated dividend stocks topics\nFoolish\nThe bottom line\nThe bottom line\nAlthough it's useful, dividend yield is only one number. Broadly speaking, relying on it alone can lead to mistakes, but when used appropriately and with other metrics to help you measure a company's strength and valuation, it can help you unlock your own investing superpower."

      "text": "Monthly dividend stocks offer investors the opportunity to generate recurring passive income while aligning that income's timing with real-world expenses. This can be particularly useful for people who are counting on dividends for income today.\nWith monthly dividend payments in mind, here's a closer look at the top monthly high-yield dividend stocks for 2025. The combination makes these stocks great for earning passive income.\nTop stocks\nTop monthly dividend stocks for 2025\nDozens of dividend stocks pay monthly dividends in 2025. However, not all of them are worth an investor's consideration. Some don't make the cut due to a below-average dividend yield or slow dividend growth. Others are at a higher risk of reducing their dividends if market conditions deteriorate. That narrows the options considerably.\nHere's a list of the best monthly dividend stocks to consider in 2025:\n| Company name | Company ticker | Dividend yield |\n|---|---|---|\n| EPR Properties | NYSE:EPR | 6.94% |\n| Agree Realty | NYSE:ADC | 4.53% |\n| Gladstone Commercial | NASDAQ:GOOD | 8.92% |\n| LTC Properties | NYSE:LTC | 6.25% |\n| Realty Income | NYSE:O | 5.43% |\n| SL Green Realty | NYSE:SLG | 5.83% |\n| Stag Industrial | NYSE:STAG | 4.37% |\nLet's take a closer look at each of these top monthly dividend stocks. Each offers a much higher dividend yield than the average stock in the S&P 500 (1.27% as of March 27, 2025).\n1. EPR Properties\nEPR Properties is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in owning experiential real estate such as movie theaters, eat-and-play venues, casinos, ski resorts, gaming facilities, themed lodging, amusement and water parks, fitness centers, and more. It secures these properties by signing triple net leases with the venue operators, meaning the tenants bear the responsibility for building insurance, maintenance, and real estate taxes.\nAfter a brutal period during the COVID-19 pandemic, EPR is back to growth as consumers have returned to in-person experiences in droves. EPR works with some of the largest and most popular operators in each of these segments, which combined make up $100 billion in market opportunity.\nIf there's a weak spot, it's movie theaters. While business has recovered from the lows, movie ticket sales are still well below pre-pandemic levels. The good news for EPR is that its theater properties are some of the busiest and most valuable for its tenants, helping insulate it from some risk.\nEPR owns 3% of all North American theaters, but those locations generate 8% of the box office. Despite that relative strength, EPR is reducing its exposure to this segment, divesting theaters as it prioritizes markets where there is growth.\n2. Agree Realty\nAgree Realty is another net-lease REIT, but it owns free-standing retail properties. It focuses on owning properties leased to essential retailers, such as grocery stores, home improvement stores, dollar stores, and drug stores, which are less susceptible to disruption from e-commerce or a recession. This strategy enables Agree Realty to generate steady rental income to support its dividend.\nAgree Realty switched from a quarterly to a monthly dividend payment schedule in January 2021. It has an excellent dividend track record overall. This REIT has increased its dividend at a 5.6% compound annual rate over the past decade, though payout growth has slowed to 2.4% over the past year.\nNonetheless, that upward trend should continue as the company keeps expanding its portfolio. The retail REIT invested $951 million in 282 properties in 2024. Between that steady portfolio growth and strong tenant relationships (it has over eight years in average lease terms under contract), Agree Realty should remain a modest, reliable monthly dividend grower for years to come.\n3. Gladstone Commercial Corporation\nGladstone Commercial is a diversified REIT that owns net leased office and industrial properties in the U.S., focusing on secondary markets because they offer higher investment yields. This strategy enabled Gladstone to generate very stable income for years, but its streak of more than 200 consecutive monthly dividends, either at or above the prior month's level, came to an end in 2023.\nThe culprit -- poorly performing office properties -- led to a 20% dividend cut as the company worked through its portfolio to offload unprofitable properties. While we can't count out another dividend cut, management seems to have stabilized the business and is back on the offensive.\nThe company is acquiring high-demand industrial properties, ensuring its office properties are well tenanted for the long term, and offloading the ones it doesn't expect can perform to its expectations. As a result, the property mix has changed. Industrial properties now generate 63% of rents while it continues to reduce the mix of office space.\nIt's still unclear when the dividend will start growing again. With a yield above 8% at recent prices, the market isn't confident in payout growth. But if management can keep up the momentum and make this industrial pivot a success, the risk-reward profile makes Gladstone an interesting monthly dividend stock to consider.\n4. LTC Properties\nLTC Properties is a healthcare REIT. It primarily invests in senior housing and skilled nursing properties secured by triple net leases, mortgage loans, and other cash-generating investment structures. This strategy gives the REIT a relatively steady income to support its monthly dividend.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic hit the senior housing sector hard, impacting LTC Properties' tenants. Several struggled to pay rent, leading some to file for bankruptcy. However, this REIT's financial strength helped it weather the storm and offset some of the lost income with new investments, allowing it to maintain its monthly dividend.\nYet, LTC has been unable to increase its payout since 2016. It's notable, though, that most of its peers have had to cut their dividends in recent years.\nLTC faces some good long-term trends but operates in a tough industry. In 2030, the number of Americans 65 and older will be double the 2010's 65-and-up population, a positive tailwind for the company. However, it must continue to stabilize its tenants and align itself with the best operators for the big-picture tailwind to reward patient shareholders. Meanwhile, investors can earn more than 6% in yield for being patient.\n5. Realty Income\nWhen it comes to monthly dividend stocks, Realty Income is the clear leader. It bills itself as The Monthly Dividend Company, having paid 657 consecutive monthly dividends as of May 2024. Since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1994, Realty Income has increased its dividend 130 times while raising the payout at a 4.3% compound annual rate, giving this REIT more than 30 years of dividend increases.\nRealty Income has lots of room to grow despite most of its tenants being relatively slower-growth businesses. The company estimates the global market opportunity for the single-tenant net lease real estate it targets to be $13.9 trillion. That's a big opportunity to continue consolidating its tenants' properties under its ownership, growing the payout, and generally rewarding patient investors monthly, year in and year out.\n6. SL Green\nSL Green is another REIT and the largest office landlord in New York City. For years, owning Manhattan office buildings -- some of the most highly demanded, irreplaceable real estate assets on Earth -- was a huge strength.\nBut the pandemic and the acceleration in changes to how and where people work continue to weigh on the office REIT. SL Green's management is adapting to the new reality by selling its least desirable and non-core assets and focusing on tenanting its vacant properties at competitive, profitable rates.\nSince 2020, a combination of asset sales and cash flow has funded a reduction in debt and stock repurchases that reduced shares outstanding by 13%. But more recently, it leveraged its improved balance sheet to go back on the offensive, making multiple new acquisitions funded in part by a secondary offering that raised some $400 million, along with some debt refinancing.\nMoreover, the bad news on the dividend has turned positive. SL Green lowered its monthly payout by 13% at the beginning of 2023, with another payout cut following just before the start of 2024. However, it raised its payout by 3% in December 2024, a modest increase but a step in the right direction. While the office environment remains a bit fluid, the worst is likely over for SL Green.\n7. STAG Industrial\nSTAG Industrial, another REIT, focuses on owning industrial real estate, such as warehouses and light industrial facilities, which are in high demand. The pandemic accelerated e-commerce adoption and increased manufacturing in the U.S. to combat supply chain issues. That has kept occupancy levels high while pushing up rental rates, enabling STAG to generate steadily rising rental income.\nSTAG has boosted its dividend over the years, with growth driven largely by the REIT's ability to consistently expand its portfolio. Since its IPO over a decade ago, STAG has added more than 400 properties to its portfolio and now owns more than 590 buildings.\nThis industrial REIT expects the steady expansion to continue. It's acquired $682 million of new buildings in 2025, adding 5.9 million square feet of space under lease for an average of six years.\nAdd that to the growing rental income from its existing properties, and STAG should be able to continue increasing its monthly dividend, so long as you're not expecting big raises. Its most recent increase was less than 1%, and over the past five years, the payout has only risen 3.5%.\nRelated investing topics\nRecurring income\nInvest in monthly dividend stocks for recurring income\nMonthly dividend stocks make it easy for investors to earn passive income. They can use that money to cover their monthly expenses or reinvest their dividends and set themselves up to generate even more recurring cash flow in the future when they need it.\nWhile dozens of companies pay monthly dividends, these monthly dividend stocks stand out as either safer, more stable dividend stocks or, in a few cases, riskier -- but potentially more rewarding -- investments in their potential to turn things around.\nFAQ\nDividend stocks FAQ\nWhat stock pays the highest dividend yield?\nThis is a tricky question, as the answer can change from one day to the next. The highest-yield stocks are often the riskiest because investors have sent share prices lower on expectations of a dividend cut. Annaly Capital Management (NYSE:NLY) is one recent example, with a dividend yield above 13% at recent prices, following a 26% dividend cut in 2023 that could be matched by more cuts in 2024.\nInvestors are often better off finding high-quality yields from companies that can maintain or even raise the payout than chasing high yields that could be a dividend trap.\nOf the stocks in this article, Gladstone Commercial pays the highest yield as of this writing. But as we note, the company may be forced to lower its payout.\nWhat stocks pay more than 6% dividend?\nOf the stocks featured in this article, Gladstone Commercial (8%), EPR Properties (6.6%), and LTC Properties (6.5%) all pay yields above 6% at recent prices, while Realty Income (5.6%) is very close to a 6% yield and has a long history of growing its payout.\nHow do I make $1,000 a month in dividends?\nLet's use the seven stocks in this article as an example. On average, they yield 6.3% in dividends yearly. So, if you invested $30,075 in each of these stocks ( a $210,526 total investment), you would generate about $1,000 per month in dividends."
