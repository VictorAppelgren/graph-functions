      "feedback": "This draft has a solid multi-asset lens but it fails to deliver a crisp 0–3 week causal map, explicit thresholds, and a disciplined treatment of conflicting tariff signals. Actionable edits: 1) Build a tight 0–3 week transmission chain with explicit catalysts and thresholds, e.g., immediate drivers: tariff pass‑through in autos (Nikkei data echoed in S15934PBQ; US price signals are contested in the article), and auto-credit tightness from ~6.43% average new‑car loan rate (CDBMWIUTB); near‑term catalysts: tariff re‑pricing moves (tariffs cut from 27.5% to 15% but contested by auto makers), Powell/Jackson Hole discourse, Lagarde on central‑bank independence (U6HXAJR4J); positioning dynamics: negative equity risk amplifying sensitivity to price shocks; and service/inflation spillovers from Vegas‑style consumer costs (6OOEK8TUR). 2) Quantify and anchor every claim to IDs: cite CDBMWIUTB for the loan-rate/negative-equity logic, S15934PBQ for tariff pass‑through vs seasonality, U6HXAJR4J for central‑bank credibility, 6OOEK8TUR for consumer cost pressures, F8GF45MEU for Bethel housing metrics, and the Vegas piece as a real‑economy cost‑of‑living signal. 3) Formalize a sharp base vs. conflict scenario: base assumes data‑dependent Fed/ECB stance preserves gradual policy normalization; tariff pass‑through is contested but plausible, with 60–70% probability that prices move in autos and consumer discretionary; bear case if tariff communication collapses or CPI undershoots, and bull case if tariff easing reduces price pressures faster and housing/legal frictions ease. 4) State key levels/thresholds and invalidation criteria: e.g., auto price inflation accelerating by more than 0.5–1.0% in next CPI print would confirm pass‑through; a material miss on CPI or a dovish pivot that surprises markets would invalidate the inflation threat; Bethel/8‑30g developments should move in a way that meaningfully tightens or loosens local leverage (e.g., approval or blocking of the 75‑unit project); Lagarde Powell Jackson Hole signals should shift rate expectations at the margin. 5) Improve structure: replace the single synthesis paragraph with a concise causal map: drivers → catalysts → reaction function → levels → monitoring. 6) Reconcile conflicts transparently: acknowledge the two sides on tariffs (S15934PBQ vs Nikkei data) and weight them with explicit probability; show where real‑economy signals (Vegas costs, Bethel housing) corroborate or diverge from tariff/auto‑credit impulses. 7) Tighten tone and length to a single, focused paragraph that stays within horizon constraints and cites IDs after the specific claims (e.g., “tariffs are being passed through to U.S. consumers per Nikkei data, per S15934PBQ, though auto makers deny price increases (S15934PBQ)” and so on).",
