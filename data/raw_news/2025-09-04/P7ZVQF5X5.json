  "description": "Manraj Sekhon, CIO of Templeton Global Investments, says India's consumption tax cuts is a positive move, noting that price elasticity is higher in India compared to the US or China. He speaks exclusively on Bloomberg\u2019s \u2018Insight with Haslinda Amin\u2019. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "OPPORTUNITIES IN INDIA. THE CIO OF TEMPLETON GLOBAL INVESTMENTS JOINS US NOW. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. WE HEARD FROM THE FINANCE MINISTER SHE SAYS IT IS VERY POSITIVE FOR GDP, BUT HOW MUCH CAN IT COUNTER 50% TARIFFS FROM THE U.S.? HAVE TO CONSIDER A FEW THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, HOW LONG WILL THIS 50% TARIFF BE IN PLACE FOR BACK ON IS IT THE SHORT TERM, THE MEDIUM-TERM, OR BEYOND? ONCE WE SEE THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE SITUATION RESOLVED, WHICH WE ARE PROBABLY CLOSER TO THE END THAN THE BEGINNING, THEN I THINK THE PRESSURE ON INDIA WITH RESPECT TO WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP FEELS ON OIL IMPORTS FROM RUSSIA, THAT PRESSURE EASES, SO YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF IF THE TARIFFS ARE HERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME OR NOT. IN TERMS OF THE TAX CUTS, I THINK IT IS VERY POSITIVE. IF YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND IN INDIA COMPARED TO THE U.S. OR CHINA, IT IS MUCH HIGHER IN INDIA GIVEN THE PROFILE OF THE AVERAGE CONSUMER -- LOWER INCOME AND SO ON. THE LAST TIME TAXES WERE ADJUSTED IN 2019, YOU DID SEE A MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENT IN DEMAND, ESPECIALLY FOR CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY ITEMS. I WOULD ARGUE THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT, AND ON THE FISCAL SITUATION, IF YOU LOOK BACK IN 2019, NET-NET, IT WAS POSITIVE FOR THE FISCAL POSITION BECAUSE THE INCREASE IN DEMAND MORE THAN OFFSET THE REDUCTION IN TAXES, SO I THINK ALL OF THAT IS POSITIVE, AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INFLATION PICTURE IN INDIA, IT HAS BEEN FAIRLY WELL BEHAVED. YOU HAVE A NEW CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK WHO IS FAIRLY DOVISH. HE HAS BEEN EASING ON A TERRY POLICY. WHEN YOU PUT THAT TOGETHER, AND EASING MONETARY POLICY PICTURE, MARKET SENTIMENT PRETTY POOR, EXPECTATIONS LOW GIVEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH TARIFFS, I THINK THIS IS A POSITIVE CATALYST FOR THE MARKET. HASLINDA: POSITIVE, BUT DOES IT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE VIEW OF THE INDIAN MARKET? I THINK YOU HAVE TO SPLIT THE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM. IN THE SHORT TERM, SOME PEOPLE WHO DO NOT FULLY APPRECIATE WHAT IS GOING ON IN INDIA ARE FOCUSED ON THE TARIFF INCREASES, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE LONG-TERM DYNAMICS OF INDIA, THE SECULAR GROWTH, THE DEMOGRAPHICS, THE TALENT, NONE OF THOSE STORIES HAVE CHANGED, AND I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INDIAN MARKET OVER THE LONG, THESE CORRECTIONS IN TIME HAVE PROVEN TO BE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES. I WOULD ARGUE THE FUNDAMENTAL SECULAR DRIVERS HAVE NOT CHANGED . IN THE SHORT TERM, YOU MIGHT STILL SEE SOME LOSS THANKS TO TARIFFS, THANKS TO THE UNCERTAINTY BROUGHT ABOUT BY TARIFF POLICY OUT OF WASHINGTON, BUT IN THE MEDIUM TO LONGER TERM, WE ARE STILL VERY CONSTRUCTIVE. HASLINDA: SO PURCHASE INDIA AND PURCHASE CONSUMPTION PLACE? CONSUMPTION WILL BE A SHORT-TERM BENEFICIARY FROM THE POLICY CHANGES, BUT IF YOU LOOK BROADLY ACROSS THE MARKET, THE NUMBER OF OTHER SECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN BEATEN UP BECAUSE OF THE TARIFF SITUATION, AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE VERY STOCK SPECIFIC. THE THING ABOUT THE TARIFF SITUATION IS THAT COMPANIES THAT HAVE PRICING POWER, COMPANIES THAT ARE A SECURE PART OF THE VALUE CHAINS, THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WILL BENEFIT. HASLINDA: WHAT IS THE BIGGEST RISK FOR INDIA? WE TALKED ABOUT THE 50% TARIFFS, AND YOU QUESTION HOW LONG THAT WILL BE. THE SIGNS ARE NOT REALLY POSITIVE RIGHT NOW. I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT THE AGENDA IS OUT OF WASHINGTON. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ON THE AGENDA FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA. HE IS FOCUSED ON THAT. THE CHINESE ARE FOCUSED ON THAT. THEY DO NOT WANT ANYTHING TO GET IN THE WAY OF THAT BECAUSE OF HOW IMPORTANT THAT ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP IS. ONCE YOU GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY, I BELIEVE THE NEXT ONE WILL BE RUSSIA/UKRAINE. THAT ISSUE NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED. WE ARE CLOSER TO THE END THAT THE BEGINNING. EUROPEANS HAVE NOT COME TO THE TABLE YET. THEY NEED TO. ONCE THAT PRESSURE COMES OFF -- AND IT WILL HAVE TO COME OFF BEFORE 2026 MEANINGFULLY BEGINS BECAUSE AT THAT POINT, PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE FOCUSED ON MIDTERM ELECTIONS, WHICH ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR HIM, ESPECIALLY NOW, AND I THINK THAT THE FOCUS BECOMES ON WHAT ELSE HE CAN DO. ONCE THE PRESSURE IS OFF WITH RESPECT TO RUSSIA, I THINK YOU CAN SEE SOME AVENUES WHERE INDIA AND THE U.S. FIND A WAY OF COMING BACK TO THE TABLE. RIGHT NOW, IT IS A LONG WAY AWAY, BUT BEAR IN MIND, THE APPROACH OUT OF D.C. HAS BEEN FAIRLY TRANSACTIONAL BASED ON THE ISSUE OF THE DAY IN THE EYES OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, SO I THINK WE SHOULD NOT WILL THAT OUT. HASLINDA: THE OTHER ISSUE INVESTORS ARE FOCUSING ON IS JANE STREET. NOW IT SAYS IT IS PUSHING BACK ON THE MANIPULATION IMPOSED ON A. HOW ARE YOU LOOKING AT THAT SITUATION? WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS BROADLY? I THINK REGULATORY SITUATIONS IN ANY JURISDICTION ARE TRICKY, AND I'M NOT PRIVY TO THE SPECIFICS OF JANE STREET, BUT I'M SURE THEY WILL WORK IT OUT OVER TIME. I THINK CITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOCUSED ON WHAT INSURERS A LONG-TERM LIQUID MARKET AND WHAT WORKS FOR ALL SEGMENTS OF INDIAN SOCIETY IN TERMS OF INVESTORS IN THE MARKET, SO I THINK THEY WILL BE FOCUSED ON THAT. THE OTHER THING I WILL SAY IS THAT I DON'T THINK THIS WILL BE RESOLVED IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. HASLINDA: BUT THIS IS A HIGH-STAKES LEGAL BATTLE, IN A WAY, RIGHT? YES. HASLINDA: IT COULD SET THE FUTURE FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS IN INDIA, RIGHT? IT IS DIFFICULT TO SPECULATE, BUT WHEREVER YOU LOOK IN THE WORLD, THERE HAVE BEEN REGULATORY SITUATIONS WHICH HAVE LOOKED TRICKY AT A POINT IN TIME, BUT OVER TIME, THEY GET RESOLVED. HASLINDA: THE BROADER MARKET IS ABOUT THE FED, HOW MUCH IT WILL CUT AND WHAT THEY WILL DO. WHAT IS CRUCIAL IS THE DATA COMING OUT ON FRIDAY. IF THE DATA COMES IN A WEEK, MIGHT 50 BE ON THE CARDS FOR SEPTEMBER -- IF THE DATA COMES IN WEAK? WHO KNOWS? NONFARM PAYROLLS ARE A VERY VOLATILE DATA SERIES. WE ARE COMING AT THE END OF THE SUMMER IN THE U.S., WHICH HAS BEEN A VERY ACTIVE SUMMER. THE WEATHER HAS PLAYED A BIG PART IN THINGS, SO IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHAT THE SHORT-TERM NUMBERS WILL BE. HAVING SAID THAT, I BELIEVE THAT OVER THE NEXT TO NINE MONTHS, CHAIRMAN POWELL WILL BE THINKING ABOUT THE LEGACY HE LEAVES BEHIND FOR HIS TERM AT THE FED. THERE WILL BE LIKELY A DOVISH NEW FED CHAIRMAN THAT WILL COME IN. CURRENTLY, MARKETS ARE EXPECTING SOMETHING IN THE REGION OF 150 BASIS POINTS BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF NEXT YEAR. I WOULD ARGUE THAT IS EXCESSIVE. IF YOU LOOK AT INTEREST RATE FORECASTS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, THEY HAVE BEEN PRETTY INACCURATE IN TERMS OF PREDICTING AND EASING MONETARY POLICY CYCLE, AND I THINK THE SAME WILL HAPPEN THIS TIME. I THINK WE WILL SEE EASING. I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF WE SEE 150 BASIS POINTS BY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD, THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS, IF YOU LOOK AT THE COMMENTS FROM SECRETARY BESSENT ON HOW MUCH THE U.S. IS PULLING IN FROM TARIFFS, IT IS ANNUALIZING AT ABOUT $330 BILLION. THAT IS A BIG NUMBER. IF YOU LOOK AT, SAY, PERSONAL CONSUMPTION, EXPENDITURE IN THE U.S., THE CHANGE YEAR ON YEAR IS ABOUT 1.5 TRILLION, SO $333 BILLION IS A BIG NUMBER. THAT NUMBER HAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE. THE TWO THINGS I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR ARE INFLATION NUMBERS PERHAPS SPIKING, REFLECTING THOSE TARIFFS, AND THAT COULD BE CAUSE FOR CONCERN FOR THE MARKET SHORT-TERM, AND ALSO THE OVERALL DEMAND PICTURE. WE HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE THAT DEMAND HAS BEEN PULLED FORWARD EARLIER IN THE YEAR GIVEN TARIFFS, SO COMPANIES, CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN PULLING FORWARD DEMAND SO THEY DO NOT HAVE TO PAY UP FOR TARIFFS, SO IT IS LOGICAL WE WILL SEE SOME FOLLOW-UP FROM THAT IN TERMS OF SLOWDOWN, SO I THINK THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR WHICH CAN SPOOK MARKETS IN THE SHORT TERM. HASLINDA: NEUTRAL, 3%, HOW QUICKLY MIGHT WE GET THERE? I THINK IT WILL TAKE LONGER THAN PEOPLE EXPECT. I DO NOT THINK WE GET THERE BEFORE THE END OF NEXT YEAR AS MARKETS ARE EXPECTING. HASLINDA: GIVEN THAT THE MARKETS ARE PRICING IN DEEPER RATE CUTS THEN WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING, IS THERE TOO MUCH OPTIMISM IN THE STOCK MARKET RIGHT NOW? TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE. WE ARE CONSTANTLY TESTING NEW HIGHS. AGAIN, THERE'S THE HEADLINE AND WHAT IS HAPPENING UNDERNEATH. IF YOU LOOK AT THE HEADLINE, MARKETS ARE UP SIGNIFICANTLY. IF YOU LOOK AT MARKETS, FIVE STOCKS ACCOUNT FOR THREE QUARTERS OF THE S & P 500. THE S & P 500 IS LOOKING AT DOUBLE-DIGIT RETURNS YEAR TO DATE, BUT THE MEDIAN STOCK IS PROBABLY LOW SINGLE DIGITS, SO THERE IS A REAL BIFURCATION IN THE MARKET BETWEEN THE AI WINNERS IN THIS ARMS RACE BECAUSE THE MARGINAL RETURNS FROM AI INVESTMENT ARE STILL SUPERNORMAL RIGHT NOW, AND THE MARKET IS GIVING THOSE COMPANIES AND LOT OF CREDIT WITH THE INVESTMENT THEY ARE MAKING, AND THEN THERE IS THE REST OF THE MARKET WHERE THERE IS UNCERTAINTY, WHERE THEY TARIFFS ARE HAVING AN IMPACT, WHERE THERE IS EVIDENCE OF A SLOWDOWN IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE LOGISTICS COMPANIES. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT A SLOWDOWN. IF YOU TALK TO TRADITIONAL ADVERTISING COMPANIES, THERE IS EVIDENCE OF A SLOWDOWN, SO YOU DO HAVE THIS BIFURCATED ECONOMY, BIFURCATED MARKET. HEADLINES SUGGEST A VERY HEALTHY S & P 500, BUT THAT AGAIN IS CONCENTRATED IN A SMALL NUMBER OF COMPANIES AS IT WAS LAST YEAR. I THINK THERE IS SCOPE FOR DISAPPOINTMENT IN THAT SPACE. HASLINDA: SO WE COULD SEE A CORRECTION OF 10%, 20%? I THINK A 10% CORRECTION IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT GIVEN HOW STRONG THIS MARKET HAS BEEN AND THE AMOUNT OF PROFITS THERE ARE OUT THERE TO TAKE, BUT I WOULD SAY THAT ANY CORRECTION WOULD PROBABLY BE SHORT-LIVED BECAUSE YOU HAVE GOT SUCH A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE MARKET THAT HAS LAGGED, AND WHERE VALUATIONS ARE NOT AS DEMANDING AS THE VERY LARGE COMPANIES, SO THERE IS NOT A LOT OF OPTIMISM THERE. THERE'S VERY LOW EXPECTATION. HASLINDA: TO YOUR POINT, THE CONCENTRATION RISKS ARE THERE. HOW BEST TO YOU PLAY, AND WHAT ARE THE MAJOR CHANGES TO YOUR PORTFOLIO THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO SHARE? WE TAKE A LONG-TERM VIEW, I THINK. THE AI STORY IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST STORIES IN OUR LIFETIME, AND THAT WILL CHANGE THE WAY ALL BUSINESSES OPERATE. IT IS HAPPENING ALREADY, SO I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE IN THAT STORY. WHERE YOU POSITION YOURSELF IS IMPORTANT, AND I THINK THE SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING THOSE IN ASIA, ARE REAL BENEFICIARIES OF THAT. SOME OF THE HYPERSCALERS ARE EXECUTING EXTREMELY WELL, SO I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE POSITIONED WITHIN THAT. OUTSIDE OF THAT AREA, I THINK YOU ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE PLACES THAT HAVE LAGGED. SOME OF THE AREAS THAT HAVE LAGGED IN THE U.S. HAVE BEEN AREAS LIKE HEALTH CARE AND SOME CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY AREAS, SO VALUATIONS HAVE BEGUN TO LOOK A LOT MORE ATTRACTIVE THERE. WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE AREAS TO TAKE AWAY SOME OF THE STEAM AWAY FROM THE BIGGER STOCKS IN THE MARKET. HASLINDA: CHINA HAS BEEN A RED HOT MARKET, AND TODAY WE HEAR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS POSSIBLY LOOKING AT SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. YOUR TAKE ON WHERE THE MARKET IS HEADED. I WOULD COME BACK TO THE BIG PICTURE AGAIN. THE MOST IMPORTANT FOCUS FOR BEIJING RIGHT NOW, AS IT IS FOR WASHINGTON, I WOULD ARGUE, IS THIS TRADE DEAL BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S., AND THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP DOES NOT WANT TO SEE ANYTHING DISTRACT OR GET AWAY FROM THAT. SO ANY SIGNAL TO THE U.S. THAT THE CHINESE MARKET IS LOOKING THROUGH THAT RISK IS INTERPRETING THE OUTCOME OVERLY POSITIVELY I THINK IS SOMETHING THEY WOULD LIKE TO AVOID, AND WHEN YOU COME BACK TO PRESIDENT XI JINPING'S AGENDA, IT HAS BEEN THE CASE SINCE HE HAS STEPPED UP INTO HIS ROLE. COMMON PROSPERITY HAS NOT GOT AWAY. IT IS ABOUT ALIGNMENT, ABOUT ENSURING THAT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CHINESE POPULATION BENEFIT FROM GROWTH, BENEFIT FROM THE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SAME WAY. DOMESTIC DEMAND HAS NOT REALLY PICKED UP IN CHINA THIS YEAR, DESPITE SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS -- HASLINDA: AND PROPERTY SECTOR HAS NOT EITHER. THAT HASN'T. THAT RALLY HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY VERY CHEAP VALUATIONS, SOME EXPECTATION THAT WE ARE PAST THE BOTTOM IN CHINA, WHICH IS PROBABLY FAIR, BUT THEY WANT TO TAKE THE STEAM OUT OF THE MARKET, SO IT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO WATCH CLOSELY. HASLINDA: BUT THE AI PLAYS IN CHINA ARE ATTRACTIVE, NO? CHINA IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARIES OF AI. NOT ENOUGH ATTENTION IS BEING PAID BY GLOBAL INVESTORS RIGHT NOW, AND I THINK THAT WILL BE",

Sekhon also discusses the impact of the RUSSIA-UKRAINE SITUATION resolution, which eased pressure on India, and the potential for 50% TARIFFS from the U.S. He suggests that the recent tax reforms have been seen as a positive for the Indian market, particularly in light of the recent rise in demand for certain products. However, he also acknowledges that this shift in demand could change the outlook on the Indian economy.
