  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None GAAP revenue was $0.6 million for Q2 2025, missing GAAP revenue estimates by 52.3% and Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2025, was $0.6 million, compared to $1.3 million in the same period of 2024.\n\u2022 None Research and development spending rose 34% to $20.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025, from $15.3 million a year earlier, driving a wider net loss for the quarter.\n\u2022 None A $64 million capital raise in July 2025 strengthened the company\u2019s cash position, extending the company\u2019s financial runway into 2028.\n\u2022 These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nAbsci (NASDAQ:ABSI), a biotechnology company focused on generative AI-driven drug discovery, issued its second quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on August 12, 2025. The release highlighted a steep revenue decline and wider losses, overshadowing operational progress in the pipeline and platform partnerships. GAAP revenue was $0.6 million, well below the $1.26 million GAAP analyst estimate. Net loss per share (GAAP) was $0.24, compared to a GAAP net loss per share of $0.22 in Q2 2024. Research and development spending (GAAP) increased notably compared to Q2 2024. In response to these trends, Absci raised approximately $64 million in gross proceeds in July 2025, extending its projected cash runway into the first half of 2028. Overall, the quarter showcased advancements in research and partnerships, but also underscored significant pressure on near-term revenue and growing expenses.\n\nAbsci is built around its \u201cIntegrated Drug Creation Platform,\u201d marrying generative artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, and wet-lab validation. In plain terms, the platform uses advanced algorithms to design and quickly test new therapeutic antibodies, drastically speeding up a process that traditionally takes years. The company says its technology can design and screen billions of antibody candidates in weeks.\n\nThe platform sits at the core of Absci\u2019s business model, supporting both the company\u2019s internal drug pipeline and collaborations with industry partners. Key factors for success include the rapid creation of promising therapies, effective use of artificial intelligence, and a flexible approach to commercializing these therapies either internally or through strategic partnerships. Maintaining a strong portfolio of patents also protects these innovations and positions Absci solidly in the competitive biotech landscape.\n\nOperational and Financial Developments in the Quarter\n\nThe second quarter featured a sharp drop in reported GAAP revenue, falling to $0.6 million and missing the $1.26 million GAAP consensus estimate. This marked a steep decline of over half in GAAP revenue compared to the same period last year, reinforcing the unpredictable nature of milestone payments and partnership recognition in biotechnology. Net loss (GAAP) was $30.6 million, up from $24.8 million (GAAP) in Q2 2024. The net loss per share (GAAP) was $0.24 for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $0.22 in the same period of 2024. This was driven primarily by higher research and development investments and expanding internal programs.\n\nResearch and development costs rose by 34% to $20.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025, from $15.3 million a year earlier. According to the company, this jump reflects direct costs for external preclinical and clinical studies, as well as higher personnel and stock-based compensation. Meanwhile, Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A, which covers operational costs not directly tied to product development) fell by 8.6% to $8.5 million (GAAP) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, from $9.3 million a year earlier, a reduction mainly attributed to lower stock compensation expenses. This shows some cost discipline outside of innovation-focused investments.\n\nPipeline progress remained a central theme. The company advanced its ABS-101 program, an antibody therapy for inflammatory bowel disease, into an ongoing Phase 1 trial, with interim data targeted for the second half of 2025. Absci is also making strides with ABS-201, a preclinical antibody being developed for androgenetic alopecia, the most common form of hair loss. This potential therapy, expected to enter clinical studies in early 2026, targets a large U.S. population of approximately 80 million individuals. Two additional programs (ABS-301 for immuno-oncology and ABS-501, an AI-designed anti-HER2 antibody for cancer) continued progressing through early-stage testing and validation.\n\nThe quarter also brought updates on partnerships. A notable development was the expanded collaboration with Almirall (specializing in dermatology), under which Absci is eligible for up to approximately $650 million in upfront, research, and post-approval payments plus royalties, subject to milestone achievements. Another multidisciplinary partnership with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) utilized AMD\u2019s Instinct AI accelerators and software to power Absci\u2019s AI platform. These agreements point to future potential revenue streams and validate Absci\u2019s integrated approach to drug discovery, though no new major deals were signed during the quarter itself.\n\nLooking Ahead: Financial Guidance and Risks\n\nManagement did not offer specific revenue or earnings guidance for the upcoming quarter or the full year, but affirmed that the company\u2019s cash and investments (post-July capital raise) can support its operations into the first half of 2028. This is a significant improvement from earlier projections, helped by the recent $64 million infusion. The company also noted that additional partnership agreements or milestones could provide non-dilutive cash inflows, though these are inherently unpredictable in both timing and amount.\n\nInvestors should pay close attention in future quarters to the pace of clinical trial advancement and the signing of new partnership agreements. Absci\u2019s financial profile remains deeply tied to milestone achievements and the success of internal programs like ABS-101 and ABS-201 in clinical studies. ABSI does not currently pay a dividend.\n\nRevenue and net income presented using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) unless otherwise noted.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."
