  "description": "How many villains is too many, Marvel and Sony?",
  "content": "Spider-Man 4 will feature practical web-swinging for the first time in the MCU\n\u2022 It's the first time it's been used in one of the webslinger's solo MCU movies\n\u2022 Marvel fans think a Wolverine foe might join the film's extensive rogues gallery\n\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day is bringing back one of the best aspects of the Andrew Garfield-led films \u2013 but some fans are more concerned about yet another villain who might appear in the Marvel movie.\n\nWith filming in full, erm, swing on the wallcrawler's next big-screen outing in Glasgow, which is being used as a stand-in for New York City (NYC), Spider-Man devotees have flocked to the Scottish city to catch a glimpse of the fan-favorite superhero. Just days into the Marvel Phase 6 film's lengthy shoot, we've got confirmation that it'll feature the long-overdue return of practical web-swinging.\n\nAs you'll see from the fan-shot footage above \u2013 thanks to Movie Effects for rounding up said footage into a single video \u2013 at least one Brand New Day set-piece will include Spidey physically swinging through NYC.\n\nHere's another angle, courtesy of YouTube user Jack Lewis, of one of Spider-Man 4's action sequences being filmed:\n\nPractical web-swinging was used in Garfield's two outings as the iconic webhead. However, that changed when Tom Holland's version of the character was introduced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in 2016's Captain America: Civil War.\n\nSince then, Spider-Man's solo movies and appearances in the two latest Avengers flicks have featured CGI recreations of Peter Parker's alter-ego swinging through his home city. Thankfully, Brand New Day director Daniel Destin Cretton wants to bring back that feeling of Spidey traversing NYC as practically as possible. That's a far cry from Jon Watts' stance on the matter, with the filmmaker behind the hero's first three MCU movies telling Collider that physical web-swinging is \"boring\" and \"looks dumb\".\n\nIs Spider-Man 4 teasing a Silver Samurai appearance or an armored Mr. Negative?\n\nAs you'd expect, most Marvel fans are delighted to see practical web-swinging return in Brand New Day. There's a small contingent, though, who are fiercely debating the potential appearance from Silver Samurai, a villain more commonly associated with iconic X-Men character Wolverine, is Spider-Man's fourth standalone MCU flick.\n\nYesterday (August 5), screenshots of the Pinterest account owned by Brand New Day costume designer Monica Avitto showed an image album labeled 'Spider-Man'. In it, numerous photographs of ancient Japanese attire can be seen, including samurai armor, Edo period hachi-gane, and ninja-inspired costumes.\n\nPredictably, some observers immediately suggested that Silver Samurai is set to appear. After all, this villain is the most recognizable shogunate-influenced character in Marvel Comics, so it has to be him, right?\n\nIf you believe a fair number of commentators on this Reddit thread, yes \u2013 but not everyone thinks that'll be the case. Indeed, some think Mister Negative, a relatively recent addition to Spider-Man's rogues gallery who's rumored to make his live-action debut in Brand New Day, is the reason for Avitto's research. As Redditor Strong_Salad3460 rightly points out in the aforementioned thread: \"It couldn't possibly have anything to do with Mr. Negative and the Inner Demons [the name of Mr. Negative's gang] who are known to wear Samurai inspired masks and wield katanas.\"\n\nUntil Marvel and/or Sony give us more official details, or more set leaks hit the internet, this debate will rage on for a while yet. But, what do you think? Could we see Silver Samurai in Spider-Man 4? Or is an armored Mr. Negative going to show up instead? Let me know in the comments.\n\nFor now, read my dedicated guide on Spider-Man: Brand New Day and check out the section below for the latest news on one of next year's most exciting new movies, which arrives in theaters on July 31, 2026.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 'We ready?': Marvel star Tom Holland reveals full look at Spider-Man: Brand New Day suit \u2013 and it's a moving tribute to the webslinger's other live-action costumes\n\u2022 New Marvel report about its X-Men movie reboot might have dispelled a big cast rumor about Spider-Man: Brand New Day\n\u2022 Spider-Man: Brand New Day behind the scenes look appears to confirm two of the Marvel movie's villains \u2013 and a possible Venom cameo",

      "text": "Marvel Phase 6 is, at the time of this article's latest update, four months away. Indeed, the final part of Marvel's Multiverse Saga begins in late July, and there'll be plenty of new movies and Disney+ shows to check out in the months and years to come.\nLuckily for you, I've rounded up everything we know about the Marvel Cinematic Universe's (MCU) next slate. Below, you'll learn more about Phase 6's full line-up, any confirmed launch dates, trailer releases, cast rosters, and story details. There's the odd rumor or two in some of the below entries, too, so proceed with caution if you're actively avoiding those.\nHere, then, is all you need to know about Marvel Phase 6.\nMarvel Phase 6: every forthcoming MCU movie and TV show\nHere's the complete list of Marvel Phase 6 projects that are due to be released and/or are in active development:\n- The Fantastic Four: First Steps \u2013 July 25, 2025\n- Eyes of Wakanda \u2013 August 6, 2025\n- Marvel Zombies \u2013 October 3, 2025\n- Wonder Man \u2013 December 2025, date TBC\n- Avengers: Doomsday \u2013 May 1, 2026\n- Spider-Man 4 \u2013 July 26, 2025\n- Avengers: Secret Wars \u2013 May 7, 2027\n- Armor Wars \u2013 TBC\n- Blade \u2013 TBC\n- Nova \u2013 TBC\n- Untitled Vision TV series \u2013 TBC\n- X-Men 97 season 2 \u2013 TBC\nMarvel Phase 6 movies\nThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\nRelease date: July 25, 2025\nDirector: Matt Shakman\nConfirmed cast: Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Julia Garner, Paul Walter Hauser, John Malkovich, Natasha Lyonne, and Ralph Ineson\nMarvel revealed The Fantastic Four's official title, new release date, and primary cast in February 2024. Four months later, Marvel chief Kevin Feige announced filming would start in July 2024 that it would be a period piece set in an alternate universe \u2013 something fans suspected after Marvel teased some key story details earlier in 2024.\nThe Fantastic Four: First Steps' official trailer finally arrived on February 4 and gave us first-looks at Marvel's iconic First Family, its retro-futuristic world, and more besides. It even included a tease of this film's Big Bad in Galactus, who'll be voiced by The Office UK's Ineson and John Malkovich's enigmatic character. Garner, Hauser, and Lyonne are also part of The Fantastic Four: First Steps' cast, but their roles are also a mystery. For more cast and plot specifics, read my dedicated hub on The Fantastic Four: First Steps.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAvengers: Doomsday\nRelease date: May 1, 2026\nDirectors: Joe and Anthony Russo\nExpected cast: Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Tom Holland, Anthony Mackie, Benedict Cumberbatch, Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach\nAfter reports suggested they'd make a shock return to the MCU ahead of San Diego Comic-Con 2024, the Russo brothers were confirmed to be helming the next two Avengers films. Avengers 5 was expected to begin shooting in January without The Fantastic Four's involvement, but the Russos have since confirmed (per Deadline) it'll begin in April.\nDowney Jr, who played Iron Man between 2008 and 2019, will surprisingly portray Doctor Victor von Doom, one of Marvel's most iconic villains. Avengers: Doomsday is also said to be bringing back another huge Marvel star in Chris Evans.\nAs for other possible returnees, Doctor Strange star Benedict Cumberbatch said he wouldn't appear in Avengers 5 before backtracking on those comments (per Business Insider). Feige has also revealed that The Fantastic Four will also feature, while the Russos exclusively told me that there's the potential for heroes from Marvel Disney+ shows to show up in Doomsday and its sequel, too.\nOn the story front, the Russos also exclusively told TechRadar which of Marvel's Secret Wars comics will influence Avengers 5 and 6's plot. The pair say the movies are \"a new beginning\" for the MCU, too \u2013 that's not a great surprise to hear, considering they'll set up Phase 7 and beyond, but it's nonetheless intriguing to learn about.\nLastly, Marvel reportedly suffered an internal leak when apparent concept art for Avengers 5 and 6 appeared online. However, the Russos claim that artwork doesn't spoil anything about the forthcoming films. Read into that what you will.\nSpider-Man 4\nRelease date: July 24, 2026\nRumored director: Daniel Destin Cretton\nExpected cast: Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Sadie Sink\nSpider-Man 4 was originally going to swing into theaters on July 24, 2026. However, its release date was pushed back one week because Christopher Nolan's next film arrives around the same time.\nHolland has confirmed filming will start in mid-2025 via a competition link on the website of The Brother's Trust charity, which he co-founded. The Hollywood Reporter (THR) and Variety claim Shang-Chi filmmaker Daniel Destin Cretton will direct it, too.\nTHR also suggests Zendaya's MJ will play a supporting role. In mid-March, new reports emerged that Sadie Sink has been cast in a key supporting role as well. For what it's worth, the Stranger Things star tried to play down that speculation on a March 2025 edition of the Happy Sad Confused podcast.\nPlot details for Spider-Man's fourth MCU outing are thin on the ground, but Holland has teased (per the Rich Roll Podcast) that it \"lit a fire in me\", and that it had him and Zendaya jumping around the room when they read its screenplay. For more, read my dedicated Spider-Man 4 hub.\nAvengers: Secret Wars\nRelease date: May 7, 2027\nDirectors: Joe and Anthony Russo\nExpected cast: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Tom Holland, Anthony Mackie, Benedict Cumberbatch, Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach\nThe sixth Avengers movie's title hasn't changed since it was announced at Comic-Con 2019. Speaking to Collider, the Russos said principal photography will begin \"a year or so\" after filming wraps on Avengers 5 but, in a more recent interview with Deadline, the duo suggested they might film both at the same time.\nAt Comic-Con 2024 (per reporter Erik Davis), Feige confirmed The Fantastic Four will feature heavily in Secret Wars alongside Doctor Doom. Cumberbatch has also intimated that, regardless of whether he appears in Doomsday or not, Doctor Strange will have a big role in Secret Wars. It's unclear which other MCU heroes and/or Marvel legacy characters will show up, but Feige has said (per io9) we shouldn't expect every superhero to appear in the next two Avengers films.\nArmor Wars\nRelease date: TBC\nDirector: TBC\nExpected cast: Don Cheadle\nOriginally billed as a TV show, Armor Wars has been retooled as a movie, with Yassir Lester (Black Monday) writing the script.\nCheadle has regularly played down \u2013 albeit jokingly \u2013 that Armor Wars isn't an official MCU project (per The Today Show and TVLine), while Lester (via MovieWeb) has even suggested that its development status shifts on a day-to-day basis, so it's unclear if it'll ever get made.\nIf it is, it should pick up events from Secret Invasion's finale, given what we learned about Rhodey (or what fans have fiercely debated about him, anyway) in that series.\nBlade\nRelease date: TBC\nDirector: TBC\nExpected cast: Mahershala Ali and Mia Goth\nAfter his off-screen Eternals cameo, the vampiric anti-hero known as Blade was expected to get an R-rated MCU movie. However, with so many issues affecting its development, nobody really knows what's going on with Marvel's Blade movie. After reports that Blade had been delayed indefinitely last November, Feige told Brazilian outlet omelete.com that Marvel was \"committed to Blade\", so the movie hasn't been scrapped entirely.\nMahershala Ali is still expected to star as the titular vampire hunter and, while Goth was heavily rumored to be playing Blade's lead villain, she confirmed she'd feature (per Deadline) before the film was seemingly shelved.\nMarvel Unlimited monthly subscription: was $9.99 per month now $4.99 at Marvel\nThe ultimate digital comics subscription for Marvel fans is offering new and returning customers 50% off their first month, which is much cheaper than a streaming subscription to watch all the best superhero movies. To gain access to a library of more than 30,000 comics, use the code 'SPIDEY50' at checkout. You're able to use the Marvel Unlimited app on all iOS and Android devices, including the web, too. But, be quick \u2013 the deal expires on May 5!\nMarvel Phase 6 TV shows\nEyes of Wakanda\nRelease date: August 6, 2025\nDirector: Todd Harris\nConfirmed cast: Winnie Harlow, Cress Williams, Patricia Belcher, Larry Herron, Adam Gold, Lynn Whitfield, Jacques Colimon, Jona Xiao, Isaac Robinson Smith, Gary Anthony Williams, Zeke Alton, Steve Toussaint, and Anika Noni Rose\nA surprise Marvel Phase 6 announcement, Eyes of Wakanda is a Black Panther spin-off that'll debut on Disney+. \"Eyes of Wakanda follows the adventures of brave Wakandan warriors throughout history,\" it story brief reads. \"In this globe-trotting adventure, the heroes must carry-out dangerous missions to retrieve Vibranium artifacts from the enemies of Wakanda. They are the Hatut Zaraze and this is their story.\"\nMarvel's Head of Television, Streaming, and Animation Brad Winderbaum told CBR.com it'll comprise four episodes and will be an anthology show in the mold of What If...?. Winderbaum also confirmed it's the first animated series that'll be part of the MCU and the so-called Sacred Timeline.\nSpeaking a D23 Expo 2024, director Todd Harris heavily teased Iron Fist (not the Finn Jones version from Netflix's Defenders-Verse) will appear in an episode. Last October, the show's first footage was also debuted as part of Marvel's 2025 'Look Ahead' trailer.\nMarvel Zombies\nRelease date: October 3, 2025\nDirector: TBC\nConfirmed cast: David Harbour, Simu Liu, Elizabeth Olsen, Randall Park, Florence Pugh, Hailee Steinfeld, Dominique Thorne, Iman Vellani, and Todd Williams\nA spin-off of What If...?, this show will pick up after season 1 episode 5 \u2013 aka 'What If... Zombies!?' \u2013 and comprises four episodes. It'll be rated TV-MA in the US (18-plus in the UK and Australia) and will be released on October 3. That means it'll arrive in time for Halloween on Disney+, aka one of the world's best streaming services.\nIn it, the MCU's newer heroes will battle the ever-growing zombie superhero threat. Vellani, who plays Ms Marvel, says her character is \"kind of the center of the show\" (per The Direct), and she'll be joined by other non-zombified individuals including Shang-Chi, Yelena Belova, Red Guardian, and Blade. Other heroes who'll have fallen prey to the growing zombie horde will rerportedly include Captain Marvel, Okoye, Ghost, Abomination, and Hawkeye.\nWonder Man\nRelease date: December 2025, date TBC\nDirector: Daniel Destin Crretton\nExpected cast: Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Ben Kingsley, Demetrius Grosse, and Byron Bowers\nWonder Man is an eight-part comedy series (per Winderbaum on the Phase Zero podcast) that tells the story of an actor who not only plays a fictional superhero, but possesses real-life superpowers that he tries to hide from the world. Feige told the official Marvel podcast that it's \"extremely different\" from anything that the studio has made before.\nMarvel's Wonder Man show landed DCEU alumnus Abdul-Mateen II for the titular role, aka Simon Williams/Wonder-Man, in November 2022. Kingsley, who played Trevor Slattery in Iron Man 3 and Shang-Chi, is also part of proceedings.\nBased on the 15 seconds of footage we saw in the 'Look Ahead' teaser, Slattery will be Williams' mentor. Demetrius Grosse (via TVLine) is reportedly playing Eric Williams and his supervillain alias Grim Reaper, too, while Deadline reports Byron Bowers is on board in an undisclosed role.\nUntitled Vision TV show\nRelease date: TBC\nDirector: TBC\nExpected cast: Paul Bettany, James Spader, and Todd Stashwick\nThis second WandaVision spin-off is expected to arrive on Disney+ in 2026. Bettany told THR that filming will begin in early 2025 but, as of March, principal photography hasn't begun.\nWritten by Star Trek: Picard season 3 showrunner Terry Matalas, it'll star Bettany as White Vision, the revived, persona-less synthezoid body of the deceased Vision (he died in Avengers: Infinity War), who flew off for parts unknown in episode 9 of WandaVision, aka one of the best Disney+ shows. No other details are known, but it could be inspired by Marvel's 'Vision Quest' and Tom King's 'Vision' comic series runs.\nTHR claims James Spader will return to voice Ultron, while Deadline suggests minor Iron Man antagonist Raza (played by Faran Tahir) will also show up. Deadline has also reported that The Franchise's Ruaridh Mollica in on board in a mystery role and THR says Picard's Todd Stashwick will portray an unnamed assassin hunting Vision for the synthezoid tech he possesses.\nLastly, Deadline suggests Elizabeth Olsen's Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch might also cameo, though it's unclear if this will be the real character or a version that White Vision fabricates.\nX-Men 97 season 2\nRelease date: TBC\nDirector: TBC\nExpected cast: Ray Chase, Jennifer Hale, Alison Sealy-Smith, Cal Dodd, J.P. Karliak, Lenore Zann, George Buza, Holly Chou, Matthew Waterson, and Ross Marquand\nWith its first season ending on a cliffhanger \u2013 read my X-Men 97 season 1 ending explained article for more \u2013 a second season seemed inevitable.\nThankfully, work has been ongoing for some time, with THR reporter Borys Kit saying season 2 has been in development since mid-2022. It's now in post-production, with Winderbaum telling the Official Marvel Podcast: \"I've already seen all the animatics and we're well on our way to creating something that hits the heights of the first season. I know the first season is an emotional ride [and] that ride continues in a very X-Men fashion in the second season\". For more details, read my dedicated hub on X-Men 97 season 2.\nA third season (per Entertainment Weekly) is already in development, too, with Deadline claiming What If...? writer Matthew Chauncey will take the reins for season 3 following the alleged firing of former showrunner Beau DeMayo.\nNova\nRelease date: TBC\nDirector: TBC\nExpected cast: TBC\nA Nova project is in the works, with Feige telling ComicBook.com it'll focus on the Richard Rider version of the cosmic superhero. Speaking to Collider, Winderbaum teased it'll be a cross between Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica, while Deadline seemingly confirmed it'll be a Disney+ show.\nAs of mid-March, though, development has been paused on Nova, with Winderbaum saying (via the Phase Hero podcast): \"When we develop something, the material might be great, but the timing might be wrong\u2026 we\u2019re only going to make things we feel are ready and can go on for multiple seasons\". Like Blade and Armor Wars, then, this one is on ice for the time being.\nFor more Marvel coverage, find out how to watch the Marvel movies in order, read our thoughts on the best Marvel movies, or get the lowdown on the final two Marvel Phase 5 productions.\nAs TechRadar's senior entertainment reporter, Tom covers all of the latest movies, TV shows, and streaming service news that you need to know about.

      "text": "- Some of Spider-Man: Brand New Day's villains appear to have been revealed\n- A now-deleted Instagram post teased who Tom Holland's wallcrawler may face in the Marvel movie\n- It also offers fresh hope over possible Daredevil and Venom cameos\nTwo of Spider-Man: Brand New Day's villains might have been revealed ahead of time by an unlikely source.\nJust days before filming begins on the hotly anticipated Marvel project, an assistant to the movie's director Destin Daniel Cretton seems to have given the game away about some of the bad guys that Tom Holland's webslinger will do battle with.\nYesterday (July 29), a post uploaded to the Instagram account of Hiyo Cao showed two specific Spider-Man comic book covers that dropped some big clues about said villains. Indeed, the literary works in question \u2013 1974's 'The Amazing Spider-Man #134' and 1991's 'The Amazing Spider-Man #345' \u2013 show Spidey facing off against Tarantula and Boomerang.\nThis doesn't confirm that these members of the wallcrawler's extensive rogues gallery will make their live-action debuts in Brand New Day. However, the fact that Cao quickly deleted their post \u2013 though not quick enough, as evidenced by screenshots obtained by X/Twitter fan accounts, including @cosmic_marvel (see below) \u2013 indicates there might be some truth to the pair showing up in Spider-Man 4.\nDestin Daniel Cretton\u2019s assistant has shared a new post on Instagram featuring multiple Spider-Man comic covers.Kevin Feige previously said that Destin will be bringing multiple comic covers to life in \u2018SPIDER-MAN: BRAND NEW DAY\u2019 \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/43zsZBRlAWJuly 29, 2025\nRecent comments made by Marvel President Kevin Feige also suggest Tarantula and Boomerang are set to feature. Speaking to Collider, Feige said Cretton has \"eight or nine comic covers up on his wall in his art department that he is bringing to life in this movie, which is super cool\". That implies Cretton will recreate these comic covers in a live-action format. Based on Cao's now-deleted post, it's highly likely Tarantula and Boomerang will make their Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) bows in Spidey's next big-screen adventure.\nThis isn't the first time Boomerang has been linked with a role in the Marvel Phase 6 flick. In May, Boomerang was one of three villains reportedly set to feature in Brand New Day, with the others being Tombstone and Scorpion. If Tarantula is set to join that contingent, alongside other rumored Spider-Man antagonists like Mister Negative, it could be that some of them only have minor roles to play in proceedings. Alternatively, Marvel might be building out a prototype roster of The Sinister Six, i.e. the titled bestowed on a group of supervillains who team up to take down the iconic webhead in Marvel literature.\nBoomerang and Tarantula's potential appearances aren't the only ones that these two comic books tease. Indeed, 'The Amazing Spider-Man #134' also features Daredevil in a supporting role, while 'The Amazing Spider-Man #345' includes the re-emergence of Venom.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nFans have longed for a team-up between Spider-Man and Daredevil on the silver screen. Additionally, the end of 2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home revealed that a part of the Symbiote, which bonded to Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock in the on-hiatus Sony Spider-Man Universe, was left behind in the MCU after Eddie and Venom's brief multiversal jaunt in Marvel's cinematic juggernaut.\nWill we see Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock/Daredevil reunite with Holland's Peter Parker following their all-too-brief scene together in No Way Home? And will Spidey acquire his iconic black suit if the left-behind symbiote bonds to him in Brand New Day? Who knows but, considering Jon Bernthal's Frank Castle/The Punisher will show up in Brand New Day \u2013 he does so in 'The Amazing Spider-Man #134', which lends further weight to Tarantula's appearance \u2013 we can't officially rule out either scenario, i.e. Daredevil and Venom popping up, just yet.\nWith filming set to begin on Spider-Man 4 shortly, I'm hoping we'll get some sneaky behind-the-scenes shots that confirm or deny any or all of the above. Until then, read more of my Brand New Day coverage below.\nYou might also like\n- Spider-Man: Brand New Day's place on the Marvel timeline appears to have been revealed \u2013 here's when the MCU movie might take place\n- Spider-Man: Brand New Day will start filming in August, and I'm desperate to have some of my biggest questions answered about the Marvel movie\n- Spider-Man: Brand New Day reportedly set to feature one of the first Avengers in a big role, but I hope it's not true for two huge reasons\nAs TechRadar's senior entertainment reporter, Tom covers all of the latest movies, TV shows, and streaming service news that you need to know about.

      "text": "New movies will continue to come thick and fast throughout August \u2013 and that's a promise. Indeed, this weekend (August 1 - 3) alone sees up to four new films debut in theaters \u2013 depending on where you live \u2013 so you've got plenty to choose from at your local cinema in the coming days.\nThere'll be lots more big-screen entertainment fare to enjoy in the final five months of 2025, too, so read on to learn more about the biggest new movies that'll be released between now and October 31 (NB: I'll be adding entries for November and December in due course).\nNew movies: August\nThe Bad Guys 2\nRelease date: out now (worldwide)\nEveryone's favorite band of reformed anthropomorphic villains are back. The Bad Guys 2 will reunite us with Mister Wolf and company after they turned over a new leaf in their first big-screen outing. Unfortunately, they'll be roped back into a life of crime when they're forced to tackle a spacefaring mission for a group known as The Bad Girls.\nThe Bad Guys is a *ahem* criminally underseen animated flick, so I was already looking forward to its sequel before its 87% Rotten Tomatoes critical score confirmed it's worth paying for.\nTogether\nRelease date: out now (US and Australia); August 15 (UK)\nA supernatural body horror, Together stars real-life married couple Alison Brie and Dave Franco as Mille and Tim. After moving across the country amid some relationship tensions, the pair soon find themselves at the mercy of a terrifying unknown entity that threatens to corrupt their love, lives, and flesh.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThere was a lot of early buzz around this one before its general release. Based on its 91% critical and 80% audience scores on Rotten Tomatoes, it's proven to be another banger from indie studio Neon.\nBring Her Back\nRelease date: out now (US and Australia); August 1 (UK)\nRelease date: out now (worldwide)\nAfter their first feature film \u2013 A24's Talk to Me \u2013 earned plenty of acclaim in 2022, Danny and Michael Phillipou, aka the duo known as RackaNacka, are back with another horror flick that spooked fans around the globe ahead of its August 1 release in the UK.\nBring Her Back stars Sally Hawkins and Billy Barratt among others, but that's about as much as we know about this mystery-laced supernatural horror. Indeed, its trailers don't give us much information on its story. Nevertheless, it seems like it's better to go into this one blind. Indeed, given its 89% critical rating and 79% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, you're best watching it with as little information rattling around in your head as possible.\nThe Naked Gun\nRelease date: out now (US and UK); August 21 (Australia)\nIt was going to happen eventually. In an era where Hollywood's biggest studios just love to remake classic films for no reasons whatsoever, Paramount Pictures is rebooting its Naked Gun franchise for... reasons.\nIn this big-screen revival, Liam Neeson plays Frank Drebin Jr, aka the son of Leslie Nielsen's Frank Drebin from the original films. Little else is known about its plot, but you can expect it to try and recapture the laugh-out-loud, spoof-comedy nature of the franchise's first few installments. Based on the two trailers I've seen, I had little hope that one of August's new movies would do so. However, its 90% critical and 87% commercial scores on Rotten Tomatoes have not only stunned me, but may persuade me to actually check it out.\nFreakier Friday\nRelease date: August 7 (Australia); August 8 (US and IK)\nAnother legacy sequel that, in some people's eyes, is long overdue.\nFreakier Friday will reunite us with mother-daughter duo Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Anna (Lindsay Lohan), who find themselves trading places with the other \u2013 that being, their consciousness being transferred into the other person's body \u2013 during another freak accident. This time around, though, Anna's daughter and soon-to-be-stepdaughter are also thrown into the mix, making for a four-way body swap that'll create even more mayhem for those involved.\nWeapons\nRelease date: August 8 (worldwide)\nZach Cregger, writer-director of criminally underseen horror film Barbarian and producer on one of this year's early hits in sci-fi horror-thriller Companion, will look to continue making a name for himself with this forthcoming mystery horror film.\nWeapons will tell the disquieting story of a bunch of kids, all of whom are in the same class at school, mysteriously vanish on the same night and at the same time. Cue its community and devastated parents asking what and why all but one of their children have suddenly gone missing.\nWith a starry cast including Josh Brolin, Julia Garner, Alden Ehrenreich, and Benedict Wong, and a deeply unsettling teaser that's got film buffs talking, Weapons could be another big 2025 hit for Warner Bros.\nNobody 2\nRelease date: August 14 (Australia); August 15 (US and UK)\nThis Bob Odenkirk-starring action film franchise will aim to shake off its 'John Wick clone' image when its sequel arrives in mid-August.\nNobody 2 reunites us with Odenkirk's family-man-hitman Hutch Mansell, whose much-needed family vacation gets interrupted when he inadvertently involves himself in the affairs of another notorious mob boss. Cue a frenetic and action-packed albeit light-hearted sequel spectacle that is going all-out to distance itself from Keanu Reeves' beloved assassin-based movie series.\nMaterialists\nRelease date: out now (US and Australia); August 15 (UK)\nCeline Song's directorial feature debut, Past Lives, was one of the best movies of 2023. Thankfully, she's avoided the so-called 'sophomore slump' with her latest flick, aka a romantic drama called Materialists that's earned slightly positive 79% critical and 67% audience scores on Rotten Tomatoes.\nDakota Johnson inhabits the title role as Lucy, a New York-based matchmaker who learns the harsh lesson that love doesn't come easy, even to those whose job it is to set up singletons. Indeed, Lucy will find herself torn between her imperfect ex John (Chris Evans) and seemingly perfect match Henry (Pedro Pascal) in this A24 movie that tugs at the heartstrings.\nHoney, Don't!\nRelease date: August 22 (US and UK); TBC (Australia)\nFan-favorite director Ethan Coen returns with his silver-screen feature in late August.\nHoney, Don't! stars Margaret Qualley as a small-town private investigator whose latest case sees her try to get to the bottom of a series of grisly murders that all tie back to a mysterious cult-like church leader. Former Captain America star Chris Evans takes on the role as the aforementioned antagonist-in-chief as he continues to branch out from his days as one of Marvel's most popular superheroes. Pencil this one in if you're a fan of an Coen brothers-created project.\nEddington\nRelease date: out now (US and Australia); August 22 (UK)\nThe latest feature film team-up between filmmaker Ari Aster and Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix, this contemporary western comedy-drama looks and sounds like a hoot.\nPhoenix stars as Joe Cross, the sheriff of Eddington, New Mexico who becomes embroiled in an increasingly tense stand-off with the town's mayor Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal) amid the height of 2020's global pandemic. Emma Stone, Austin Butler, and Micheal Ward are also part of the cast.\nA film that's been pretty well received (if you only take its 67% and 64% Rotten Tomatoes scores into account), Eddington might be worth a watch.\nThe Life of Chuck\nRelease date: out now (US); August 21 (Australia); August 22 (UK)\nFrom the minds of horror auteurs Mike Flanagan and Stephen King, this Tom Hiddleston-fronted Neon flick couldn't be a less scary film. In fact, it's being billed as a modern day version of classic Christmas flick It's a Wonderful Life, which certainly isn't the kind of movie anyone expected to see from Messrs King and Flanagan.\nIn The Life of Chuck, we follow Charles 'Chuck' Krantz, a seemingly ordinary fellow whose life we watch play out in three distinct chapters: his childhood, young adult life (Hiddleston plays Chuck during this period), and as an elderly man.\nLittle else has been publicly revealed about the movie's plot, but it looks and sounds like it could be the sleeper hit of the summer. Based on its 81% and 88% Rotten Tomatoes critical and audience scores, it's one you won't want to miss.\nCaught Stealing\nRelease date: August 28 (Australia); August 29 (US and UK)\nBased on Charlie Huston's book namesake (he also penned its screenplay), crime-comedy Caught Stealing stars Austin Butler as Hank Thompson, a former baseball wonderkid-turned-bartender who gets more than he bargained for when his punk British friend Russ (Matt Smith) asks Hank to look after his cat for a few days.\nWith a fun-looking trailer, an all-star cast that looks at the top of its game, and a bona fide filmmaking legend in Darren Aronofsky at the helm, Caught Stealing could make a play to *ahem* steal the show at the global box office in late August.\nNew movies: September\nThe Roses\nRelease date: September 1 (worldwide)\nAustin Powers, Borat, and Meet the Parents filmmaker Jay Roach will aim to bring his signature brand of cringey and slapstick humor to the fore in his latest feature film The Roses.\nBased on Warren Adler's 'The War of the Roses' novel, which was previously turned into a movie in 1989, this reimagining stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman as Theo and Ivy Rose. A pitch-perfect couple with a fulfilling marriage, things take a turn for the worse when Theo's career starts to nosedive as Ivy's takes off. Cue reams of hidden resentment boiling to the surface. Andy Samberg, Ncuti Gatwa, Allison Janney, and Kate McKinnon are among the starry supporting cast.\nThe Conjuring: Last Rites\nRelease date: September 4 (Australia); September 5 (US and UK)\nBilled as the final The Conjuring movie that'll star Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as Lorraine and Ed Warren, Last Rites will kick off spooky season when it arrives in early September.\nTaking on last terrifying case, the married couple and real-life paranormal investigators attempt to banish a demonic entity from a family home. Predictably, things won't progress as smoothly as the Warrens hope. Expect scares aplenty and \u2013 hopefully \u2013 a fitting end to Wilson and Farmiga's time playing two of the most famous supernatural researchers that the world has ever seen.\nThe Long Walk\nRelease date: September 11 (Australia); September 12 (US and UK)\nThe next Stephen King novel to get the silver screen treatment, The Long Walk is a dystopian horror story that's set in an alternate universe. In it, the annual, titular event sees 100 young men walk \u2013 without stopping and while maintaining a speed of four miles per hour (6.4 kilometers an hour) \u2013 down US Route 1. The catch? Anyone who stops three times is executed right there on the spot.\nDirected by The Hunger Games' Francis Lawrence and starring Mark Hamill, Cooper Hoffman, David Jonsson, and Ben Wang among others, this tension-fueled survival drama will scratch the itch of those who'll still be mourning the end of Squid Game by mid-September.\nDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale\nRelease date: September 11 (Australia); September 12 (US and UK)\nIt's almost time to bid farewell to one of the UK's biggest franchises in many a year. Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale is not only the third and final film in the series, but it'll also bring down the curtain on the must-see period drama for the last time.\nGiven it'll be the enterprise's final hurrah, you can expect all of your favorite characters (and the actors who play them) to return, too, including Hugh Bonneville and Simon Russell Beale. As for what its story entails, it'll reunite us with the Crawley family and their staff as they head into the 1930s and all of the changes that accompany this decade.\nSpinal Tap II: The End Continues\nRelease date: September 12 (US and UK); September 25 (Australia)\nOver 40 years after This is Spinal Tap, a mockumentary flick that tells the story of the titular parody metal band, a legacyquel is set to hit theaters in mid-September.\nAfter a 15-year hiatus in the fictional world they occupy \u2013 Spinal Tap also exist in the real world, just to confuse matters... \u2013 the eponymous trio join forces once more to play one final concert for their rabid fanbase. With the same brand of musical mayhem and behind-the-scenes comedy-drama sensibilities set to play out courtesy of docu-filmmaker Marty DiBergi, fans of the cult classic flick will be hoping Spinal Tap II shreds as much as its forebear did.\nA Big Bold Beautiful Journey\nRelease date: September 18 (Australia); September 19 (US and UK)\nFrom Sony Pictures and US-South Korean director Kogonada, Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell star in this fantasy drama as Sarah and David.\nSingletons who meet during a mutual friend's wedding, they soon find themselves in the hands of fate itself as they embark on the titular trek that sees them collectively relive moments from their individual pasts and how their current lives might alter their separate and shared futures. One of September's new movies that I'm most excited for.\nHim\nRelease date: September 19 (US and UK); September 24 (Australia)\nThe latest unsettling feature to be executively produced by horror extraordinaire Jordan Peele, Him follows Tyriq Withers' Cameron Cade, a rising American football star who's trained by eight-time Championship quarterback Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans) after Withers emerges from a coma following an attack by a hysterical fan.\nHowever, Cade soon realizes that his hero isn't all that he seems and, in the pursuit of greatness, he's forced down a disorienting rabbit hole that might cost Cade more than he realizes.\nThe Strangers: Chapter 2\nRelease date: September 26 (US and UK); TBC (Australia)\nA direct sequel to The Strangers: Chapter 1 \u2013 but bizarrely, the fourth entry in the horror-thriller film series \u2013 this flick reunites us with Maya (Madeleine Petsch), Gregory (Gabriel Basso), and Shelly (Ema Horvath) following the events of the aforementioned movie.\nLittle is know about what Chapter 2's plot entails, but it won't be the franchise's final installment. Indeed, a third film is due out sometime in 2026, so it'll be interesting to see if its next entry is actually good enough to have warranted a follow-up.\nOne Battle After Another\nRelease date: September 25 (Australia); September 26 (US and UK)\nLeo's back. That's right, the multi-award-winning Leonardo DiCaprio is set to appear in his first movie since 2023's Killers of the Flower Moon in this Paul Thomas Anderson-directed action-comedy that's due out in late September.\nLeading an all-star cast that included Benicio del Toro, Regina Hall, Sean Penn, and Teyana Taylor, One Battle After Another sees DiCaprio portray Bob Ferguson. A member of a group of ex-revolutionaries, Ferguson rallies his former allies to rescue one of their daughters when a foe of yesteryear re-emerges from the shadows and kidnaps her.\nExpect a typically great performance from DiCaprio, regardless of how good or bad this ends up being.\nNew movies: October\nTron: Ares\nRelease date: October 10 (worldwide)\n15 years after Tron: Legacy reignited people's interest in the Tron movie series, the franchise's third entry is set to make a new generation aware of light-cycles and the perils of digital worlds.\nIn a twist on the series' formula, though, Tron: Ares will see Jared Leto's Ares, a highly sophisticated program, sent to the real world for reasons unknown. Greta Lee, Evans Peters, and Gillian Anderson are among its supporting cast, while franchise veteran Jeff Bridges will return in some capacity.\nWith artificial intelligence (AI) becoming an increasingly regular fixture in our lives, you can expect Tron: Ares to explore themes concerning the digital landscape, AI, and the dangers of other technological advancements as part of its story.\nAfter The Hunt\nRelease date: October 10 (US); TBC (UK and Australia)\nLuca Guadagnino will look to continue his hot-streak on the silver screen with this enticing Amazon/Sony Pictures psychological drama that'll star big names including Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield, and Ayo Edebiri.\nIn it, Roberts plays Alma Olsson, a college professor whose professional and personal lives collide when her star student Maggie (Edebiri) levels an accusation against one of Alma's colleagues Hank (Garfield), who also appears to be obsessed with Alma. If you liked Challengers, you'll probably love this.\nGood Fortune\nRelease date: October 16 (Australia); October 17 (UK and Australia)\nAziz Ansari returns to the silver screen after an 11-year absence in this religion-centric comedy flick that's already sparked some comparisons with Dogma.\nIn it, fan-favorite actor Keanu Reeves plays Gabriel, a well-meaning but inept guardian angel who begins meddling in the affairs of a down-on-his-luck gig worker (Ansari) and wealthy venture capitalist (Seth Rogen). One of October's new movies that could be a sleeper hit.\nSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere\nRelease date: October 23 (Australia); October 24 (US and UK)\nJeremy Allen White will temporarily hang up his apron from The Bear as he trade the kitchen for the big stage in 20th Century Studios' Bruce Springsteen biopic.\nThe movie, which is based on Warren Zanes' similarly titled book, chronicles the making of the legendary musician's 1982 'Nebraska' album as he contends with demons from his past and being on the precipice of global superstardom. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere's first trailer suggests it'll hook us all when The Boss' biopic hits theaters in late October.\nMortal Kombat II\nRelease date: October 24 (worldwide)\nAfter its predecessor received a day-and-date released in theaters and on HBO Max amid the pandemic, the second installment of Warner Bros' live-action Mortal Kombat movie series will only arrive in cinemas globally later this year.\nThis time around, Karl Urban (The Boys, Dredd) stars as fan-favorite character Johnny Cage, who's recruited to take part in the life-threatening tournament that was only tentatively teased in its forebear. The reason? Earthrealm is threatened by the malicious Shao Khan, so its defenders will need the help of every hero, reluctant or otherwise, to keep it safe from harm.\nBugonia\nRelease date: October 30 (Australia); October 31 (US); November 7 (UK)\nThe latest cinematic team-up between actor Emma Stone and director Yorgos Lanthimos, Bugonia is a western remake of South Korean sci-fi comedy film Save the Green Planet!.\nIn it, Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis play two conspiracy-fuelled young men who kidnap the CEO of a powerful corporation (Stone) after they become convinced she's an alien hellbent on destroying planet Earth. Expect plenty of unusual camera shots, quirky and cringe-based humor, and deadpan performances from its cast throughout.\nWant more new movies recommendations?

      "text": "- Set to be released in July 2026\n- Official title revealed in April\n- Filming began in August\n- No trailer revealed yet\n- Tom Holland returning as Peter Parker/Spider-Man\n- Some supporting cast members already revealed\n- No plot brief yet, but some story rumors have appeared online\n- Unclear how it'll impact the next two Avengers movies\nWork on Spider-Man: Brand New Day is officially underway. The next Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movie, whose official title has ties to a very controversial time in the superhero's comic book history, is set to arrive in theaters next July. So, it's high time that principal photography on the highly anticipated film began.\nThere's been plenty of speculation about Spider-Man 4 in the lead-up to the cameras rolling \u2013 so much so, in fact, that you might have struggled to stay on top of it all. Luckily for you, I've rounded up every piece of official news, plus the biggest and latest rumors, about the Marvel Phase 6 film in this guide. If you want the lowdown on Spider-Man's next big-screen adventure, then, you've come to the right place.\nFull spoilers follow for Spider-Man: No Way Home. Possible spoilers are also discussed for Brand New Day, so proceed at your own risk.\nSpider-Man 4 release date\nA post shared by Tom Holland (@tomholland2013)\nA photo posted by on\nOriginally, Spider-Man: Brand New Day was set to swing into theaters on July 24, 2026. However, four months after its initial launch date was announced, Sony and Marvel confirmed Spider-Man 4's release would be delayed one week. Now, it'll come out on July 31, 2026.\nLast October, Tom Holland also shared an exciting Spider-Man 4 filming update on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon \u2013 the British actor revealing that principal photography would start in mid-2025. That proved to be the case, too, with Spider-Man: Brand New Day due to start filming in August. As filming got underway, Holland took to his Instagram account to confirm he'd started shooting the movie on August 2.\nIt's unclear how long its shooting schedule will last but, with the MCU film due out in less than a year, there's plenty of hard work ahead for everyone.\nSpider-Man 4 trailer: is there one?\nNo, a trailer for Spider-Man: Brand New Day isn't available yet. In my view, one won't arrive until early 2026, either, with it most likely premiering during Sony's panel at next year's CinemaCon panel. I'll update this section once one is released.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nSpider-Man 4 cast: confirmed and rumored\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day's full cast hasn't been officially revealed yet. Holland is the only cast member confirmed to appear by Sony and Marvel, but there are other actors who've said they're part of proceedings and/or been reported as being involved:\n- Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man\n- Zendaya as MJ\n- Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk\n- Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle/The Punisher\n- Sadie Sink as TBC\nHolland aside, Zendaya's MJ is the only other character who's expected to pop up in Spider-Man 4. Speaking on the Rich Roll podcast last October, Holland namedropped his real-life girlfriend as someone who should show up. Jacob Batalon's Ned Leeds is another character from Spidey's first three MCU outings who might also show up, but I've seen little evidence that he'll return.\nOther established MCU characters are expected to be part of proceedings. In May, reports emerged that Spider-Man: Brand New Day would feature one of the original Avengers in Ruffalo's Banner/The Hulk. One month later, numerous outlets claimed Bernthal's Castle/The Punisher would also appear in Spider-Man 4. Bernthal has since seemingly confirmed he'll feature (see the TikTok video below).\nConsidering Spider-Man: No Way Home was something of a hard reset for the wallcrawler in the MCU, there'll be plenty of new faces we'll be introduced to.\nThe first \u2013 and arguably most intriguing \u2013 is the character who Stranger Things star Sadie Sink is playing. Marvel reportedly cast Sink in Spider-Man 4 in mid-March, and she's been linked with playing everyone from fan-favorite X-Men superhero Jean Grey to Mayday Parker, aka the daughter of Peter Parker and Mary-Jane Watson in the comics. For what it's worth, a recent Marvel report about the comic titan's forthcoming X-Men movie has, in my opinion, ended speculation that Sink may portray Grey in Brand New Day. We'll see if I'm right if any on-set images of Sink leak online in the weeks and months ahead.\nIt sounds like Spider-Man: Brand New Day will aim to replicate No Way Home's success by telling a story containing multiple villains, too.\nIn May, a Marvel leak indicated Spidey could face off against three primary villains. Two months later, a behind-the-scenes look at Brand New Day appeared to confirm who two such foes in B-list villains Tarantula and Boomerang. Surprisingly, neither of them were Mack Gargan/Scorpion, who was very briefly portrayed by Michael Mando in Spider-Man: Homecoming's mid-credits scene. Taking to Instagram in early August, Mando heavily implied he was returning as one of the webslinger's most iconic supervillains.\n#SpiderMan4 pic.twitter.com/r9l1nEmmtJAugust 1, 2025\nBut wait, there's more. Images captured by fans from Spider-Man: Brand New Day's Glasgow-based set also suggest Mister Negative, a fairly recent addition to the hero's rogues gallery, is also involved. The evidence? An Inner Demons logo on the side of a tank (see the X/Twitter post above), which is the emblem used by Mister Negative's forces.\nOther cast rumors abound about Spider-Man 4. Deadline has claimed The Bear's Liza Colon-Zayas has signed on in an undisclosed role, while J.K. Simmons is thought to be returning as The Daily Bugle's Spidey-hating editor J. Jonah Jameson (per industry insider DanielRPK).\nElsewhere, Andrew Garfield has again denied his version of the titular hero will appear (per Deadline) and Daredevil star Vincent D'Onofrio has said not to expect Wilson Fisk/Kingpin to show up (per the Happy Sad Confused podcast) because his version of the character can only be used on the small screen. Lastly, as much as fans want it to happen there's no word on whether Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock/Daredevil will team up with Spidey after Murdock made a brief cameo in No Way Home.\nSpider-Man 4 plot speculation\nFull spoilers follow for Spider-Man: No Way Home.\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day doesn't have a story synopsis yet. Nevertheless, there's still a fair amount we can deduce about its plot.\nFor starters, No Way Home ended with Spidey go back to being a friendly neighborhood hero. That movie's finale saw Doctor Strange cast a spell that made the world forget Peter Parker was Spider-Man, thereby allowing him to return to his roots before he was thrust into the superhuman limelight in Captain America: Civil War.\nWith no Tony Stark-created tech available to him, he's also returned to his superhero origins and created his own suit. Tom Holland gave us our first full look at the updated suit he'll wear in Brand New Day in early August \u2013 the full reveal coming 24 hours after a Spider-Man 4 video teased his new superhero attire.\nA post shared by Anthony | Tom Holland Updates (@tomhollandupdates)\nA photo posted by on\nWe've also learned when the film may be set, with fan-snapped set images indicating Spider-Man: Brand New Day will take place sometime in 2027. That place places it three years after No Way Home on the MCU timeline and, if true, means Holland's Parker has been operating as his crime-fighting alter-ego for some time without anyone knowing who he is. That would be enough time for him to rack up a sizeable number of street-level villains, including the ones I mentioned in this article's cast section.\nSpeaking of street level events, Marvel President Kevin Feige told Collider that Brand New Day will be a more grounded take than its forebear, saying: \"We are seeing, for the first time in the Tom Holland Spider-Man stories, him being a proper Spider-Man. Him being by himself, dedicated to saving the city, and dealing with \u2013 for lack of better terms \u2013 street-level crime, as opposed to world-ending events.\"\nWe don't know what kind of street-level story we'll get outside of that, but fan videos from Brand New Day's set have shown the webslinger riding atop a tank. Meanwhile, images uploaded to the Pinterest account of the movie's cinematographer Brett Pawlak imply that Spidey will do battle with The Hulk at some point (see the X/Twitter post below). Could we see the return of Savage Hulk? And what would cause Banner/Smart Hulk to de-evolve back into his original form?\nSo this was on Brett pawlak Pinterest account, interesting https://t.co/4wdQsHpXW4 pic.twitter.com/gvQcNB6GI6June 27, 2025\nFinally, Spider-Man: Brand New Day is no longer sandwiched between the next two Avengers movies.\nOriginally, Avengers: Doomsday was due out in theaters on May 2026, i.e. two months before Spider-Man 4. However, Marvel announced it was delaying the release of Avengers: Doomsday and its sequel, with the films now expected to arrive in December 2026 and December 2027. DanielRPK has since suggested that meant parts of Brand New Day needed to be rewritten to reflect its story taking place before those movies, so it'll be interesting to see if Spider-Man 4 will directly lead into Doomsday or, like Thunderbolts*, contain an end credits stinger that teases what's to come in Avengers 5.\nWhat does the future hold for Spider-Man after Avengers 5 and 6?\nWe don't know. If, as it's believed, Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars lead to a soft reboot of the MCU \u2013 Feige has teased this will happen \u2013 it's possible that this reset could be the opportune time for Holland to walk away from his most iconic acting role.\nThat said, it could also be the perfect time for Holland's Spider-Man to become a mentor to a live-action Miles Morales. The star of animated offerings Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, aka two of the best Spider-Man movies, could wind up in the MCU as part of this soft reboot. If he does, Holland's Parker could teach this iteration of Morales how to use his powers, which he does in the Spider-Verse movies and Insomniac's Spider-Man videogame series, before officially passing the torch onto Morales to become the MCU's new wallcrawler.\nFor what it's worth, Feige told Brazilian outlet Omelete that he wants to bring Morales to the MCU, but later told Variety that he can't until Sony's Spider-Verse film series has ended. The franchise's final entry \u2013 Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse \u2013 isn't due out until June 4, 2027. But, with Secret Wars lined up to arrive six months later, the dominoes may fall into place that enable Morales to finally make his live-action debut in the MCU.\nEven if that happens, I can't see Spider-Man: Brand New Day being Holland's last solo adventure in the MCU. He's too big of a name and Spider-Man's too popular of a character for the A-lister to end his association with the superhero post-Secret Wars. I fully expect Holland to co-star alongside whoever's hired to play Morales in the MCU in Spider-Man 5, then, before potentially passing on the mantle in Spider-Man 6. As always, though, we'll see what shakes out in the films to come first.\nFor more Marvel coverage find out how to watch the Marvel movies in order and/or how to watch the Spider-Man movies in order.

      "text": "Summary\n- Practical effects can fall flat visually when it comes to Spider-Man swinging scenes, according to director Jon Watts.\n- Using technology and cinematic tricks is crucial to enhance the authenticity of superhero dynamics on screen.\n- The next Spider-Man director should heed Watts' advice on balancing practical stunts with CGI for a visually stunning film.\nJon Watts, the director who brilliantly helmed the recent trilogy of Spider-Man movies, offered a piece of indispensable advice for whoever steps into his shoes for the next installment of the beloved superhero saga. Speaking with Collider's Steve Weintraub at CCXP in Mexico City, Watts reflected on his extensive experience directing Spider-Man and shared a practical tip for future filmmakers in this high-flying franchise. Watts, who spent nearly a decade crafting some of the most dynamic and successful films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, understands the intricacies and challenges of bringing such a visually intensive superhero to life and doing so successfully, as his films grossed over $3.3 billion worldwide in theaters.\nWhen asked about his insights for future Spider-Man directors, Watts didn't hold back on delivering a straightforward piece of advice based on his own experiences. He said:\n\"I have a very practical bit of Spider-Man advice, and I think every Spider-Man director goes through it. It doesn't look good when someone is just swinging on a rope. You think you're gonna go in there, you're like, 'we're gonna do it all practical. We're gonna get a stuntman. We're gonna be swinging around.' It's boring. It looks dumb. It looks like a monkey swinging on a vine when you put someone on just a rope. Don't waste your time. That's my advice to the next Spider-Man director,\"\nJon Watts Knows How to Make Spider-Man Look Good\nWatts' candid comments clearly highlight the challenges of translating comic book action to the big screen, where practical effects need to be carefully balanced with the visual demands of superhero dynamics. The director's advice underscores the importance of using technology and cinematic tricks to enhance the authenticity and excitement of Spider-Man\u2019s iconic swinging sequences, rather than relying solely on practical stunts that might fall flat visually.\nPractical effects have their place, but as Watts points out, there's a fine line between breathtaking and brutal when it comes to live-action web-slinging. Whoever picks up the directorial baton next will have big boots to fill, and they'd be wise to heed Watts' advice if they want their Spidey to soar rather than sink. It\u2019s all about mixing the right amount of movie magic with some high-quality CGI to keep audiences glued to their seats rather than rolling their eyes.\nStay tuned to Collider for more exclusive interviews and insights from the movers and shakers behind your favorite blockbuster hits at CCXP.

      "text": "- Spider-Man: Brand New Day could feature another major Marvel superhero\n- The latest cast rumor suggests one of the original Avengers will have a sizeable role to play\n- If true, Marvel and Sony might retread old storytelling ground with their inclusion\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day will apparently feature another major Marvel superhero \u2013 and, if true, I'm worried that the film will retread old storytelling ground in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).\nYesterday (May 26), a report from superhero fansite Nexus Point News suggested one of the original six Avengers will show up in Spidey's next big-screen adventure. Nexus Point News also indicated that said individual would have a substantial role to play in the Marvel Phase 6 movie, too. Potentially big spoilers immediately follow for Spider-Man 4, so proceed at your own risk.\nAccording to Nexus Point News's sources, Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk will have a large supporting role in Brand New Day. There's no information on how Banner or his gamma-irradiated alter-ego will fit into proceedings, but there are murmurings that he could be the latest scientific genius to mentor Tom Holland's Peter Parker.\nNow, it's unclear if Nexus Point News' latest claim is true. For what it's worth, the outlet's overall track record can be described as pretty accurate. Per the ResetEra forums, they were the first website to break the news that Alex Garland was set to direct an Elden Ring film adaptation. That claim, which was made on May 6, was made almost three weeks before A24 and Garland were confirmed to be working on an Elden Ring movie.\nIf this Hulk rumor ends up being true, though, it raises two major concerns about the film's plot for me \u2013 both of which lean into some tired and cliched narrative beats that the MCU has already explored.\nThe first worry I have is that Holland's Spider-Man might get another mentor figure. After making his MCU debut in Captain America: Civil War, the webslinger was taken under the wing of Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, until his death in Avengers: Endgame. It can also be argued that Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange temporarily assumed the role of a mentor figure, albeit a slightly antagonistic one, in Spider-Man: No Way Home, too.\nThe prospect of Ruffalo's Banner becoming the wallcrawler's third tutor-style figure in just four Spider-Man films to date would be overkill as far as I'm concerned. It would also undo the ending of Spidey's third solo outing in the MCU, with No Way Home being the hard reset that the webhead needs to not only grow up as an individual, but thrive as a hero without supervision.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nBanner's (and, by proxy, Hulk's) inclusion also presents an uninspired storytelling situation we've seen before. That being, a Marvel hero potentially having to battle the big, green, lean machine.\nWhether it's Avengers: Age of Ultron or Thor: Ragnarok, we've already seen the likes of Iron Man and Thor square off against Hulk. More recently, we've also witnessed Sam Wilson's Captain America go toe-to-toe with a similar foe in US President Thaddeus Ross' Red Hulk \u2013 the duo fighting in the final act of Captain America: Brave New World.\nNow, given their respective strengths, a Spider-Man versus Hulk fight could be interesting, but do we really want to watch another superhero brawl with Banner's superhuman alias? I certainly don't.\nThere are numerous Spider-Man villains who deserve to show up in his next film. In fact, three are reportedly set to feature in Brand New Day. That's before you look at other members of his rogues gallery who are rumored to feature, such as Mister Negative, Silver Sable, and Tarantula. Unless Spidey teams up with Hulk to defeat this collection of villains, what purpose would it serve to include the Savage Hulk side of Banner's persona as another 'bad guy' for the webslinger to deal with?\nOf course, this is all speculation at this point, so we'll have to wait until filming gets underway (it's expected to start in August) to see if Ruffalo is spotted on one of Brand New Day's sets. If Banner does show up in Spider-Man 4, I really hope it's not in a new advisor capacity or as an antagonistic figure because the MCU needs to take some creative steps forward and not look back at what's worked before. So, Marvel and Sony, lean into the 'new' aspect of Brand New Day's title, please.\nYou might also like\n- Spider-Man 4's official title has been revealed \u2013 and it has ties to a controversial time in the Marvel hero's 80-year-plus comic book history\n- Marvel delays release of Avengers: Doomsday and its sequel, and now I've got two big questions about what happens next\n- Find out how to watch the Spider-Man movies in order\nAs TechRadar's senior entertainment reporter, Tom covers all of the latest movies, TV shows, and streaming service news that you need to know about.

The Glasgow Times and Herald Scotland have indicated principal photography will get underway on August 2, with Glasgow acting as a cost-saving stand-in for New York City.\nBoth newspapers have reported that numerous roads will be inaccessible to vehicles (except for emergency services) and the public from July 28 until August 13. Production designers and set dressers will move in to alter the appearance of certain streets to give them an American feel before the Marvel Phase 6 movie's first scenes are filmed between August 3 and 8.\nThere's no word on which actors will be present on set to start shooting Spider-Man 4, but I'm hoping that some of my biggest questions about the forthcoming flick will be answered once filming begins.\nWhat questions do I want answering when filming on Spider-Man 4 starts?\nThe main query I have is who's actually been cast in Spider-Man's latest adventure.\nSo far, Holland is the only actor confirmed to appear. He'll reprise his role as Peter Parker and his superhuman alter-ego, but the rest of the movie's cast remains a mystery.\nWell, on the official confirmation front, anyway. There have been plenty of rumors, plus unofficial actor confirmations via the trades, about who'll show up in one of 2026's most anticipated new movies.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nFor example, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon have been linked with roles in Brand New Day. The pair last appeared in a Marvel film in 2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home, but they also played MJ and Ned Leeds in Holland's two other solo movies. Considering how the aforementioned flick ended, it's unlikely they'll have substantial roles this time around.\nElsewhere, Stranger Things star Sadie Sink is reportedly set to co-star alongside Holland in Spider-Man 4. There's no word on who she might portray, but Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) fans have their theories.\nThere are numerous other new and established MCU characters who could show up. Brand New Day may bring John Bernthal's Frank Castle/The Punisher to the silver screen for the first time. Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner/The Hulk has also been tapped to appear in Spider-Man 4 if online gossip columns are to be believed. There's speculation that three big Spider-Man villains could pop up in Brand New Day, too.\nAway from its potential castings, I also want to know if it'll be another multiversal film or not. I'd prefer Brand New Day to be more of a street-level story for the wallcrawler, but considering No Way Home made over $1 billion globally thanks to its multiversal Spider-Man team-up, I wouldn't be surprised if some parallel universe shenanigans have been woven into its plot.\nI don't expect Spider-Man 4's first few days of filming to confirm or deny any or all of these rumors. Nevertheless, whether some of them are officially addressed by Marvel and/or Sony, or we discover more details by way of any leaks that emerge from its set, I'm hoping we learn something new about its cast and plot ahead of Spider-Man 4's July 31, 2026 launch date.\nYou might also like\nAs TechRadar's senior entertainment reporter, Tom covers all of the latest movies, TV shows, and streaming service news that you need to know about.

      "text": "- Spider-Man's new costume for Brand New Day has been fully unveiled\n- Marvel and Sony released a new video showing the costume in all of its glory\n- Its lead star Tom Holland is shown wearing the superhero suit\nTom Holland has officially unveiled the first full look at the new costume he'll wear in Spider-Man: Brand New Day \u2013 and I've immediately fallen in love with it.\nJust 24 hours after an all-too-brief Brand New Day video teased Spider-Man's new attire, a new teaser, which was released by Sony Pictures, shows off the super-suit in all of its glory.\nThe 22 second-long video, which was uploaded to Sony's YouTube channel today (August 2), begins with the somewhat melancholy Spider-Man piano-based theme we heard in yesterday's footage. As some hanger bay doors open and light rushes in from outside, we see the silhouette of Holland, who has his back to the camera, jogging on the spot as he prepares for what could be his first day on the Brand New Day set in Glasgow, Scotland.\nAround the 0:10 mark, Holland suddenly pivots and walks towards the camera. Approaching it, he smiles as he reveals the webslinger's new costume in full. Holland then looks across to someone off-screen, asks \"We ready?\", looks back into the lens, smiles again, and heads off, presumably to start shooting his next Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film.\nThe first thing to note about Spidey's new garb is it appears to be an updated version of the suit he's seen wearing in the final scene of Spider-Man: No Way Home. Indeed, apart from the raised webbing on the outside of the suit and the black logo adoring the chest area, it appears to be an exact match to the aforementioned ensemble.\nA post shared by Spider-Man (@spidermanmovie)\nA photo posted by on\nWhat's even more interesting, though, is that Spidey's new gear looks like it's paying homage to Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's live-action iterations of the character. The raised webbing is a clear tribute to Maguire's costume, while the black, slim logo is an obvious nod to the emblem that adorned Garfield's suit.\nConsidering Holland, Maguire, and Garfield's wallcrawlers teamed up in No Way Home via some multiverse shenanigans, it's evident these more experienced Peter Parkers left a lasting impression on Holland's version. It's unsurprising, then, that he'd honor the pair by incorporating aspects of their costumes into his own.

      "text": "- Marvel is reportedly searching for young actors for its X-Men movie reboot\n- A new report suggests it'll help the studio to make a cheaper film\n- If true, it might solve a big mystery about one of Spider-Man: Brand New Day's cast members\nA new report claims Marvel is looking for up-and-coming actors to play the X-Men in its rebooted film series \u2013 and, if true, it might solve one of Spider-Man: Brand New Day's biggest mysteries.\nPer Variety, the comic giant is eyeing younger talent to portray its iconic mutants in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). According to an agent Variety spoke to, Marvel's decision to hire rising stars and unknown quantities is part of a new cost-cutting mandate that aims to reduce how much it spends on new movies and Disney+ shows.\nVariety's article, which was published yesterday (July 30), arrives just over a week after Marvel president Kevin Feige dropped the biggest hint yet over the type of star he wants to see in Marvel's untitled X-Men movie.\nSpeaking to Nerdist, Feige, who also confirmed Thunderbolts* director Jake Schreier would direct the flick after online reports claimed he would, said: \"Jake has his pulse on, shall we say, a younger demographic. Not \u2013 he\u2019s younger than me, for sure \u2013 but he\u2019s tapped into that in a way that I think is important. It was important for Thunderbolts* [and] much more important for X-Men, because X-Men, as it was in the comics, will be a very youth-oriented, focused, and cast movie.\"\nWhat has Marvel's X-Men movie cast scouting got to do with Spider-Man 4?\nIn some ways, Marvel's plan to scour the globe for young talent to star in its forthcoming X-Men film is similar to 20th Century Fox's approach to its own X-Men movie series reboot. The latter saw the likes of James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and Jennifer Lawrence appear in four films \u2013 starting with 2011's X-Men: First Class \u2013 that featured a younger version of Professor X, Magneto, and company.\nIf it's true that Marvel is seeking out less established actors to portray the MCU's X-Men to save cash, it almost certainly puts a pin in one cast rumor concerning Spider-Man: Brand New Day. Indeed, Spider-Man 4, which has just started filming in Glasgow, Scotland, is reportedly set to feature Sadie Sink in a substantial role alongside Tom Holland's webslinger.\nThere's been no official word on which character the Stranger Things actor might play \u2013 in fact, nobody close to the movie's production has actually confirmed that she's part of proceedings. Nevertheless, one of the prevailing theories about who she could portray is Jean Grey, aka one of the most famous mutants in Marvel's storied history.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIn light of Marvel's apparent desire to keep costs down across the board on its X-Men project, though, the possibility that Sink could play Jean Grey is basically a non-starter.\nAccording to a Puck newsletter circulated to subscribers in January 2023, Sink is reportedly set to earn over $7 million for Stranger Things season 5. At the time, Puck indicated the wildly popular Netflix show's final season led to all of its main cast members receiving bumper new pay deals.\nIt's difficult to corroborate Puck's claim. However, if it's true, Sink's seven-figure sum for one of the best Netflix shows' final hurrah would basically rule her out of playing Jean Grey in the MCU. Marvel isn't going to pay Sink that kind of sum if it planned on hiring her to play the telekinetic superhuman across multiple projects. Feige has already confirmed the X-Men will be front and center of the MCU after Avengers: Secret Wars wraps up the Multiverse Saga. Whoever signs on to play one of mutant-kind, then, will be in it for the long haul and Marvel will ensure they're locked into deals that won't increase their pay 10-fold every time they appear.\nNeed more proof that hiring non-A-listers for comic book movies is the way to go from a financial perspective? Just look at Superman, the first DC Universe (DCU) movie released as part of James Gunn and Peter Safran's rebooted cinematic franchise. According to a July 2025 edition of the Puck newsletter, leading man David Corenswet was paid just $750,000 to appear in the DCU Chapter One film. That's around a tenth of what Sink is apparently going to earn from Stranger Things 5.\nIf Marvel wants to save money, it should follow DC Studios' lead and not fork out seven-figure sums to anyone it hires to play one of the X-Men. It's for that reason alone that I'm more than convinced than ever that Sink can't possibly be playing Jean Grey in Spider-Man's next big-screen adventure.\nFor more on Holland's next MCU project, including why Spider-Man 4's release date was delayed, check out my dedicated guide on Spider-Man: Brand New Day.

      "text": "- A new Marvel leak has reportedly revealed which villains will appear in Spider-Man 4\n- Three members of the webhead's rogues gallery could appear in the MCU film\n- It's unclear if there's any truth to this particular Marvel Phase 6 movie rumor\nHere we go again. Just days after numerous X-Men movie reboot casting rumors appeared online, speculation concerning which villains will appear in Spider-Man: Brand New Day has begun circulating the *ahem* web.\nThe superhero film, which is slated to be released in July 2026, is expected to start shooting sometime in August. It's not entirely unexpected, then, that rumors about which members of the webhead's rogues gallery will show up in the co-developed Marvel and Sony Pictures flick.\nHowever, what is surprising is the source that's leaked which villains will appear in the Marvel Phase 6 movie. Yes, there will reportedly be multiple bad guys for Tom Holland's Peter Parker to face off against.\nBefore I dive into said leak, though, it's worth bearing a couple of things in mind.\nOne, take these rumors with a huge pinch of salt \u2013 until Marvel and/or Sony say otherwise, or a world-famous trade publication with solid contacts within the industry, such as Deadline or The Hollywood Reporter, suggests this is true, it's best to treat this as conjecture. The other thing? Potentially big spoilers immediately follow for Spider-Man's next big-screen adventure, so proceed with extreme caution.\nAlright, let's get down to business. Earlier today (May 20), Instagram user trusthigashi took to the social media platform to reveal they'd attended the 2025 edition of Disney's Consumer Products event. This year's presentation took place in Las Vegas, and included the announcement of a deal between Disney and F1, as well as the casting of Conan O'Brien as a new character called Smarty Pants in Toy Story 5.\nBut back to Brand New Day. As part of said presentation, trusthigashi claims that Disney confirmed three villains would appear in Spider-Man 4. Scorpion, whose Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) debut was teased in 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming \u2013 aka the 15th entry on our best Marvel movies list \u2013 is among that trio. Joining Mack Gargan on villain duties, according to trusthigashi, are Lonnie Lincoln/Tombstone and Frederick Meyers/Boomerang.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nA post shared by Chris Higashi (@trusthigashi)\nA photo posted by on\nInterestingly enough, Steven Yeun (The Walking Dead, Invincible), who was originally hired to play Sentry in Marvel's Thunderbolts* movie before scheduling conflicts forced him to drop out, was linked (per industry insider MyTimeToShineHello, whose track record is best described as mixed), with playing a villain in Spider-Man 4 on May 19.\nHowever, while some observers assumed he'd been chosen to portray Martin Li/Mister Negative in the comic-book flick, others Marvel fans took to Reddit to point out that hiring a Korean actor in Yeun to play a Chinese character would be a controversial move on Marvel and Sony's part. So, many suspect that if Yeun is in talks to appear in Brand New Day, it won't be as one of the wallcrawler's most recently created villains.\nSo, what are the odds that trusthigashi's leak has more than an air of legitimacy to it?\nThat's hard to say. On the one hand, the image caption section of their Instagram post contains proof that they were present at Disney's Consumer Products 2025 presentation. It would be very surprising, then, if they fabricated the stuff about Brand New Day's villains.\nHowever, it would also be odd for Disney to reveal which of the webslinger's most notorious antagonists would appear in Spider-Man 4. Sony owns the live-action rights to the character so, unless Disney got the green light from its fellow studio to drop this information at the event, I doubt Sony would be happy to learn that a rival revealed this key storytelling detail before it could.\nThat said, Marvel (and, by proxy, Disney) owns the rights to Spider-Man's merchandising deals. Given that this presentation took place during a three-day event dedicated to consumer products \u2013 of which merchandising is one such arm \u2013 Disney appears to have the right to discuss all things Spider-Man as it sees fit.\nRegardless of whether you believe trushigashi's leak, with principal photography set to start on Brand New Day soon it won't be long until we get official confirmation on who'll actually appear in one of 2026's most anticipated new movies. That includes the apparent role that Sadie Sink has in Spider-Man 4, with the Stranger Things star supposedly tapped to co-star alongside Holland and Zendaya, who's also expected to return as MJ.\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day is currently set to arrive in theaters on July 31, 2026.\nYou might also like\nAs TechRadar's senior entertainment reporter, Tom covers all of the latest movies, TV shows, and streaming service news that you need to know about.
