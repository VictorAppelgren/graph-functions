  "title": "These Airlines Have Issued Travel Waivers Today For Major East Coast Hubs Amid Tropical Storm Erin",
  "description": "Three major airlines have issued travel waivers for passengers scheduled to fly to or from East Coast airports from Portland, Maine to Washington, D.C.",
  "content": "Due to forecasted heavy rain and thunderstorms along the East Coast, and with Tropical Storm Erin likely to become the season\u2019s first hurricane, major U.S. airlines are allowing passengers flying in or out of hubs in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic to change their travel plans at no extra cost. Summer thunderstorms are a common cause of flight delays.\n\n\u201cA large area of warm and moist air already present across the eastern U.S. and into the Deep South will be an ingredient for scattered showers and thunderstorms that are expected to be most active from late afternoon into the evening hours,\u201d according to the National Weather Service. \u201cHeavy rain can be expected to accompany the stronger storms through the next couple of days in these areas.\u201d\n\nHow Can Air Travelers Stay Updated On Flight Delays And Cancellations?\n\nAs of 9:45 a.m. Wednesday, more than 930 flights in the United States were delayed, according to data from Flightaware. This is not unusual in the summer. Travelers flying Wednesday and Thursday afternoon should check their flight status before heading to the airport to make sure it is operating on time. Passengers with flights covered by an airline travel waiver may consider rebooking to a later date without having to pay a change fee or fare difference. Travelers can download the carrier\u2019s app to monitor for updates or plug their flight information into FlightAware and click the \u201cWhere is my plane now?\u201d link just under the flight number. The tool lets flyers see if their plane is running ahead of schedule, on time or behind schedule\u2014typically before the airline announces a delay or cancellation, which can save valuable time if rebooking is necessary.\n\nTropical Storm Erin will \u201clikely become a hurricane by late Thursday or early Friday\u201d according to the most recent update from the National Hurricane Center. As of Wednesday morning, the storm has maximum sustained winds of 45 mph and is moving across the Atlantic Ocean at a speed of roughly 20 mph and will impact portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by this weekend. Most forecast models do not show the storm making landfall in the United States.\n\nTropical Storm Erin Expected To Become First Major Hurricane Of 2025 Atlantic Season: What To Know (Forbes)",

However, Tropical Storm Chantal managed to directly hit the East Coast early last month, bringing flooding and tornadoes to the Carolinas, where at least six people died.\nTangent\nHurricane Henriette formed in the Central Pacific Ocean on Sunday. The system is north of Hawaii and is expected to continue northward before weakening around Wednesday and Thursday.\nKey Background\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration updated its hurricane season forecast last week, forecasting the number of named storms this season to reach between 13 and 18. Of those storms, five to nine could become hurricanes and two to five could be major hurricanes. NOAA predicts a 50% chance for an above-normal season, a 35% chance of a near-normal season and a 15% chance of a below-normal season. An average season has 14 named storms. Outside of Tropical Storm Chantal\u2019s deadly landfall in July, the U.S. has so far been spared of direct impacts this season. NOAA says warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic and Caribbean have contributed to its predictions for a busy hurricane season.\nFurther Reading\nPrediction remains on track for above-normal Atlantic hurricane season (NOAA)"
