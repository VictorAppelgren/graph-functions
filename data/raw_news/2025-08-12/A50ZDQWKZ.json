  "title": "AI boom may drive over 60% surge in US nuclear capacity by 2050",
  "description": "US nuclear power is set for a comeback, with capacity rising 63% to 159 gigawatts by 2050, driven by AI data centers, supportive policy, plant upgrades, and modular reactors after 2035.",
  "content": "This article was written by Bloomberg Intelligence industry analyst Nikki Hsu, with contributing analysis by Scott J. Levine and Gabriela Privetera. It appeared first on the Bloomberg Terminal.\n\nUS nuclear power is primed for a resurgence, with capacity rising 63% to 159 gigawatts by 2050 in our scenario \u2014 a $350 billion-plus build-out fueled by AI data centers\u2019 hunger for reliable, carbon-free energy. Policy support and narrowing cost gaps with renewables will spur growth, with early gains from plant upgrades and restarts, and small modular reactors scaling after 2035.\n\nNet nuclear capacity may climb 52 GW from 2036-50 \u2014 a 2.7% compound annual growth rate \u2014 driven by policy support and AI data-center demand for clean, reliable power. Most additions arrive after 2035, as progress on small modular reactors (SMRs) may be constrained by permitting timelines, first-of-a-kind construction and financing risks and immature supply chains. BI\u2019s scenario assumes new reactors start by 2038, mirroring the 1970-90 pace of 4.5 GW a year. The high end reflects faster SMR adoption and favorable policy. The low end assumes delays on all fronts, resulting in more muted growth. We also factor in the retirement of 2 GW in 2049-50 as three reactors reach 80 years of operation.\n\nOverall, BI projects 61 GW of net additions in 2025-50, lifting nuclear\u2019s share of US power generation to 20% from 18% in 2024.",

  "argos_summary": "US nuclear power is expected to see a significant increase in capacity, projected to rise by 63% to 159 gigawatts by 2050, driven by demand from AI data centers for reliable, carbon-free energy. This growth, estimated to require over $350 billion in investment, will be supported by policy initiatives and advancements in technology, particularly small modular reactors (SMRs) after 2035. The net nuclear capacity could increase by 52 GW from 2036 to 2050, with nuclear's share of US power generation rising from 18% to 20% by 2025.",
