(NASDAQ:ENPH) has launched its fourth-generation Enphase\u00ae Energy System, which includes the IQ\u00ae Battery 10C, IQ\u00ae Meter Collar, and IQ\u00ae Combiner 6C. Shipments of the system are now in progress and promise greater energy density, simpler installation. The IQ Battery 10C produces 7.08 kW of continuous power and 10 kWh of usable energy.\n\nThe new battery uses lithium iron phosphate chemistry for safety and longevity, and it can save up to 62% of wall space while delivering 34% more energy density than previous models. The IQ Meter Collar makes whole-home backup easier and makes installation less complicated, and the IQ Combiner 6C combines load control, solar, battery, and EV charging into a single container. The system supports the Domestic Content Bonus Credit with U.S. manufacturing and comes with a 15-year warranty. Installers Cutler Bay Solar Solutions, Atma Energy, and Allterra Solar complimented the system for its effectiveness, affordability, and capacity to drastically reduce installation timelines. It is ranked sixth on our list of the Best Clean Energy Stocks.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ENPH as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock. It\u2019s not riding on hope.\nIt\u2019s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.\nThis is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!\nThe Reveal: Our Top Short-Term Stock Pick for 2025\nThis is the moment when most newsletters put up a paywall and ask you to spend $99.99 to find out the name of the stock.\nBut we\u2019re not doing that today.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nAt Insider Monkey, we believe in earning your trust first\u2014by delivering real value, upfront.

      "text": "In this article, we will discuss: 13 Best Car Stocks to Buy in 2025.\nCar stocks are the stock holdings of businesses engaged in the automotive market, such as those that produce automobiles, auto parts, or industry-related services.\nAccording to Reuters, U.S. new car sales in 2024 grew significantly from their pandemic lows due to increased production, restocked inventory, and growing demand for hybrid cars. As per Wards Intelligence, new car sales in the United States hit 15.9 million in 2024, up 2.2% from 2023 and the highest since 2019.\nIn 2025, S&P Global forecasts that global sales of new light vehicles, or passenger cars and trucks, are projected to rise 1.7% to 89.6 million units. The overall reduction of 2025 automotive estimates reflects anticipated changes in US policy following the election. There will be significant impacts on the demand for vehicles as a result, particularly on interest rates, trade flows, sourcing, and the rates of BEV adoption.\nColin Couchman, executive director of global light vehicle forecasting for S&P Global Mobility, commented:\n\u201c2025 is shaping up to be ultra-challenging for the auto industry, as key regional demand factors limit demand potential and the new US administration adds fresh uncertainty from day one,\u201d \u201cA key concern is how \u2018natural\u2019 EV demand fares as governments rethink policy support, especially incentives and subsidies, industrial policy, tariffs, and fast evolving OEM target setting.\u201d\nChris Hopson, principal analyst at S&P Global Mobility, recently stated that consumers who are considering buying a new car are hurrying to dealers before possible price implications become apparent. The sales spikes in March and April might open the way for future volatility. In the next three months, automakers will face new, tariffed inventory and production levels in addition to unstable economic conditions.\nIn response to industry criticism, President Trump recently introduced a two-year relief provision linked to domestic sales and manufacturing volume, which loosened the recently imposed 25% tariffs on cars and parts. Now, automakers with U.S. factories can deduct import taxes on parts, starting at 3.75% of the suggested retail price of a car in the first year, and then 2.5% in the second year. Vehicles with 85% U.S., Canadian, or Mexican parts are exempt from tariffs, which will rise to 90% by next year. Furthermore, the administration exempted these companies from overlapping taxes on Canadian and Mexican commodities, steel, and aluminum. After industry groups warned that the duties, which went into effect in March for automobiles and on May 3 for parts, would increase auto prices, lower sales, and negatively impact service costs, the move was made.\nGM chief executive Mary Barra stated:\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us,\u201d\nNonetheless, there will be plenty of fireworks as leading businesses compete for market share because the automotive industry is still evolving. According to Dentons, the automotive industry will need to be adaptable, creative, and flexible in 2025 as it manages changing consumer demands, regulatory changes, and economic challenges. In a market that is competitive and evolving quickly, Original Equipment Manufacturers can position themselves for success by taking advantage of developments in manufacturing technologies, software-defined vehicles, and electric vehicles.\nWith that said, here are the 13 Best Car Stocks to Buy in 2025.\nMethodology\nFor this article, we sifted through the online rankings to form an initial list of the 20 Car Stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 13 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 1,009 hedge funds in Q4 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. We have used the stock\u2019s YoY revenue growth as a tie-breaker in case two or more stocks have the same number of hedge funds invested.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n13. Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 24\nLucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) is an automotive and technology firm. It creates the most advanced technologies for electric vehicles. The business provides direct-to-consumer online and retail sales along with its own distributed retail and service sites. It also includes a product roadmap for upcoming technologies and vehicle developments. The Lucid Air was developed through a clean-sheet approach to engineering and design, vertical integration, and in-house hardware and software innovation. The luxury sedan Lucid Air is revolutionizing the EV market as well as the luxury automotive market. Its geographic segments include North America, the Middle East, and Other International. It is among the Best Auto Stocks.\nLucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) reported revenue of $234.5 million in Q4 2024, 49% higher than the same period the previous year and $22.7 million higher than analysts anticipated. The company\u2019s loss per share, excluding certain items, was 22 cents, as opposed to an average estimate of 28 cents.\nThe luxury electric car maker expects to grow significantly, manufacturing nearly 20,000 vehicles in 2025 after producing 9,029 vehicles last year. In 2024, Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) delivered 10,241 automobiles, a 71% increase over 2023. Approximately $4.2 billion in extra funding was raised by the firm in 2024, which will help cover losses as it grows its production.\n12. Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 26\nPolaris Inc. (NYSE:PII) designs and produces off-road vehicles, such as motorcycles, snowmobiles, and all-terrain and side-by-side vehicles, for both recreational and practical uses. After purchasing Boat Holdings in 2018, the company expanded into the marine industry, providing exposure to yet another outdoor lifestyle market niche. More than 2,500 dealers in North America, 1,500 dealers internationally, over 25 subsidiaries, and 90 distributors in over 100 non-North American countries sell its products. It is one of the Best Auto Stocks.\nThe company has a history of successful operations, and the current management has proven operating discipline by focusing on the company\u2019s power sports roots, selling off underperforming businesses that the previous management had acquired, and continuing the tradition of returning funds to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Business cycle returns are strong, with returns on tangible capital typically in the mid- to high teens. Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII) is still well-funded even though cash generation has decreased, which is to be expected given the challenging retail environment.\nPolaris Inc. (NYSE:PII) commitment to product excellence across all market segments is further shown by the redesign of the helms in Bennington pontoons and the introduction of the new Series M in 2024, which proves how innovation in the maritime industry continues to appeal to consumers.\n11. Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 28\nLi Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI), a prominent Chinese NEV producer, creates, develops, produces, and markets high-end smart NEVs. The company launched volume production of its first model, the Li One, in November 2019. The model is a large, high-end, six-seater plug-in electric SUV featuring innovative smart car technologies and a range extension system. In 2024, it sold more than 500,000 NEVs, making up roughly 4% of the Chinese market for passenger new energy vehicles. Beyond Li One, the business is expanding its product line to include BEVs and PHEVs to reach a larger consumer base.\nLi Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) is China\u2019s leading manufacturer of new energy vehicles, developing plug-in hybrid electric sport utility vehicles for family use. The firm worked hard to develop its range-extension drivetrain, which is now a major selling feature for its affordable cars. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, or PHEVs, are significantly less expensive than battery electric vehicles, or BEVs, because they require less battery.\nLi Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) continues to rank among the Best Auto Stocks because of its rapid growth potential. In Q4 2024, the company supplied more than 158,000 vehicles, setting a new quarterly record. Deliveries surpassed 500,000 units in a full year, making it the first luxury Chinese vehicle brand and emerging NEV to reach this milestone. In 2023, there were over 373,000 deliveries, showing a 35% increase in sales despite challenges faced by other EV stocks. One major reason for this is its premium appeal, as the Li AD Max accounts for more than 80% of orders in China for models priced above $55,000."

      "text": "In this article, we will discuss: 11 Best Green Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nGreen stocks are ownership stakes in businesses that engage in ecologically friendly operations, including pollution prevention, waste reduction, electric vehicles, and renewable energy.\nPresident Donald Trump referred to wind and solar energy as \u201cunreliable\u201d and a threat to U.S. energy security in his executive order terminating subsidies for these sources, which caused solar stocks to plummet in early July 2025. The order limits safe harbor privileges until a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of facilities are constructed, eliminates tax benefits for clean power production and investment, and directs the Treasury to terminate them within 45 days. The burden of eliminating preferential programs for renewable energy fell to the Interior Department.\nThe Department of Energy cautioned in a report released the same day that blackout risks might rise 100-fold by 2030, with outage hours increasing from \u201csingle digits today to more than 800 hours per year\u201d due to scheduled retirements of 104 GW of firm capacity and reliance on non-dispatchable sources.\nWith that said, here are the 11 Best Green Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through online rankings to form an initial list of the 11 Best Green Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.

      "text": "In this article, we will discuss 10 High Growth EV Stocks to Invest In.\nAutomobiles that run on electricity rather than gas are referred to as electric cars, or EVs. Electric car stocks consist of companies that primarily manufacture electric vehicles. The electric vehicle business also includes companies that provide parts for electric vehicles, including batteries or autonomous driving systems.\nS&P Global Mobility estimates that around 7.36 million of the 16 million cars sold in 2024 were not made in the United States, showing that President Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on imported cars, which have been in effect since March 2024, affect about 46% of the country\u2019s auto market. On May 3, tariffs on some auto components, including engines and transmissions, went into effect.\nHowever, the administration unveiled a two-year relief plan in response to industry criticism. In the first and the second year, automakers that manufacture in the United States are allowed to deduct import tariffs on parts up to 3.75% and 2.5% of the suggested retail price of a car, respectively. Automobiles having at least 85% U.S., Canadian, or Mexican components are exempt; by 2025, the percentage will rise to 90%. The overlapping tariffs on commodities, steel, and aluminum from Mexico and Canada have been waived for businesses. Industry groups have issued warnings that the tariffs would increase market maintenance costs, lower sales, and boost car prices.\nRecently, according to the Cox Automotive report, in Q1 2025, sales of electric vehicles in the United States rose 11.4% year over year to around 300,000 units, making up 7.5% of all new vehicle sales, up from 7% in Q1 2024. New model launches fueled growth, with multiple brands either diversifying their EV lineups or making their first steps into the market. One significant automaker sold over 30,000 EVs, almost doubling its volume from the previous year. In Q1, another company that had not been involved in the EV market before contributed over 14,000 units. However, not all players grew; some established models experienced significant decreases as product strategies changed.\nHowever, the market for EVs is facing more challenges. A well-known EV brand had a 26% decline in sales from its 2023 peak of 173,000 units to 128,000 units in Q1, a 9% year-over-year decline, and a 3% decline in market share. Future growth is threatened by ongoing tariffs on vehicles and essential commodities like aluminum and battery supplies, as well as policy uncertainty.\nNonetheless, the research firm Rho Motion projected that China\u2019s prolonged subsidies and the new EU emissions targets will propel global EV and plug-in hybrid sales to increase by more than 17% in 2025, reaching 20 million units. China is the market leader, with EV sales forecast to jump by 40% to 11 million by 2024, and Latin America and Asia-Pacific will continue to dominate. Sales in Europe are anticipated to surge by 15% from 3 million units in 2024, even though there could be fines of \u20ac10 billion for missing emissions targets. Despite the uncertainties surrounding policy, U.S. sales have been projected to rise by 16%.\nRho Motion Head of Research, Iola Hughes, stated:\n\u201cIn the US market, a lot of uncertainty has obviously hit the market in the last year or so, and we are expecting reduced EV forecasts,\u201d \u201cHowever, the shift to electric vehicles is still very much happening and we will still see growth over the next decade.\u201d\nWith that said, here are the 10 High Growth EV Stocks to Invest In.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we sifted through the online rankings to form an initial list of the 20 EV stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with an average 5-year revenue growth of over 20%.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n10. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)\nAverage 5-Year Revenue Growth: 6.89%\nAn American multinational automaker, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) deals in trucks, cars, and auto components in addition to software-based services and subscriptions. The company has engaged in numerous share buybacks in recent years, resulting in a significant reduction in its shares. The stock\u2019s performance was significantly impacted by the company\u2019s announcement of $16 billion in buybacks between 2023 and 2025. GM also initiated an accelerated share repurchase program to quickly implement $2 billion of a new $6 billion authorization for share repurchases. It has an average 5-year revenue growth of 6.89%, making it one of the High Growth Stocks.\nIn Q1 of 2025, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) delivered an 8.8% margin in North America and showed great progress on several fronts, beating all of its key competitors and gaining over two full percentage points of U.S. market share year over year. Cadillac EVs accounted for 20% of domestic sales, helping the company\u2019s electric vehicle division soar, with over 90% year-over-year growth, making the firm the second-largest EV manufacturer in the United States. Another example of its operational resilience was how quickly it handled a supply chain disruption brought on by a supplier factory fire, affecting only 7,000 units, all of which were anticipated to be restored in Q2. By increasing its direct purchases for North American production by 27% since 2019, it has strengthened its domestic manufacturing footprint and achieved over 80% USMCA compliance in vehicles built in the United States.\nThe company is also adding innovative technologies to its vehicles. Cruise Holdings, which focuses on driver-aid systems and autonomous vehicle technologies, was fully acquired by General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) in February 2025 and will become a fully owned subsidiary of the business. The company intends to include Cruise technology in its hands-free driving assistance system, Super Cruise.\n9. Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)\nAverage 5-Year Revenue Growth: 7.82%\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) is the largest and most renowned producer of lithium, a key raw material used in electric vehicle batteries. The company is one of the world\u2019s largest lithium miners, with a production capacity of 225,000 metric tons, and it plans to nearly triple output by 2030. The supply chain challenges for lithium are complicated, and in 2025, trade regulations could make things even more challenging. However, since lithium is a commodity stock that benefits from broad market-wide pricing trends, any shortages or supply constraints would inevitably result in higher lithium prices if things do not work out, which will improve the company\u2019s bottom line. It is among High Growth Stocks with an average 5-year revenue growth of 7.82%.\nIn the first quarter of 2025, Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) reported record lithium output from its integrated conversion network, showing strong operational and financial success and solidifying its position as a major facilitator of the global energy revolution. The business made $545 million in operating cash, and its remarkable operating cash conversion rate of more than 200% demonstrated effective capital usage.\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) also achieved around 90% of the desired run rate, making significant progress on its $350 million cost and productivity improvement program. The long-term forecast is still positive, as the increasing need for grid storage and the rapid uptake of electric vehicles are expected to more than double the world\u2019s lithium consumption between 2024 and 2030. Furthermore, adjusted EBITDA climbed 30% in Specialties and 76% in Ketjen year over year, showing solid performance and diverse growth, pointing to a considerable improvement in profitability across business areas."
