  "title": "The Iniu P50-E1 power bank has earned pride of place in my everyday carry \u2013 here's why I love this speedy portable charger",
  "description": "Fast-charge your phone or top up your gaming handheld with 45W of pocket-friendly power",
  "content": "The Iniu P50-E1 packs impressive 45W charging into a genuinely pocketable size, making it an ideal daily-carry power bank for phones and partial top-ups of larger devices. It delivers above-average efficiency and capacity for its class, though the 15V output cap means it won\u2019t unlock full fast-charge speeds on every device. Minor drawbacks like surface scratches aside, it\u2019s a strong blend of portability, speed, and value.\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test.\n\nI rely on a power bank daily, and while there are plenty of compact models available, very few can keep up with the high-speed charging modern phones and portable gaming devices demand.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the Iniu P50-E1 comes in. At 83 x 52 x 26mm (3.27 \u00d7 2.05 \u00d7 1.02 in), it\u2019s very compact, and the 160-gram (0.353 lb) weight won't bog you down. It has a 10,000mAh capacity (36Wh) \u2013 enough for one or two phone charges (depending on the phone), or it can give a 50Wh Steam Deck an extra 55% or so charge.\n\nThe P50 stands out from other compact power banks thanks to the 45W output that supports PPS (Programmable Power Supply, the standard used by many phones for rapid charging) from 5V to 11V and up to 4.8A. It\u2019s aimed at those who want super-fast phone charging, and it can hit the speedy 45W charge rates that models like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra support. It can also quick-charge handheld gaming machines, though not at the full 65W some can handle.\n\nThat said, because the P50 has a maximum output of 15V, some devices that need higher voltages won\u2019t charge at full speed. For example, the P50 only reaches around 27W on the Pixel 10 Pro XL, versus the possible 39W on a charger that supports higher PPS voltages.\n\nBut perhaps most importantly, does the P50 actually do what it says on the box? Many power banks make bold claims, but in real-world testing they don't live up to the hype. I do comprehensive testing to verify charge voltages, confirm protocol support and log capacity tests.\n\nFor high-speed phone charging, the P50 outputs 32Wh of the 36Wh available. This means 13.5% is lost during conversion, which is a better-than-average result. I will note, however, that while it will happily run full pelt for more than enough time to max out a phone's charge rate, on a laptop, it slows from 45W down to 30W after 10 minutes to help avoid overheating the power bank. Charging at the max output until empty gives 29Wh, which is also a better-than-average result.\n\nA close comparison is the excellent 10,000mAh 4Smarts power bank. The latter measures 77 x 56 x 26 mm (3.03 \u00d7 2.20 \u00d7 1.02 in), weighs 200g (0.441 lb), and also has a 45W output. It produces 27Wh at max wattage and 30Wh at 20W \u2013 not quite as good as the P50. Compared to the Iniu, the 4Smarts also gets warmer under load, lacks a USB-A port, and ultimately costs more, making the P50 a clear winner on value and features.\n\nThe P50 comes with a short cable integrated into a lanyard. It\u2019s actually quite a neat solution \u2013 robust yet easy to remove. I spent considerable time swirling the P50 by the lanyard on a finger, and it didn't go flying off, so I rate it as fidget-worthy.\n\nThe unit also has a basic digital capacity display, which is fairly accurate and makes it easy to see how much power remains at a glance. It also has a little lightning bolt to show when the power bank is fast charging. You don\u2019t get any other indicators, though, like charge current or power.\n\nThe soft-touch plastic feels nice in the hand, but it is easy to scratch \u2013 especially the glossy section over the screen. In comparison, I have an Iniu B6 that has been rattling around in my bag for over 2 years now that uses the same construction. It has plenty of little marks, but it\u2019s only cosmetic and the construction is very strong. So I am confident the P50 will also hold up long term.\n\nOverall, the Iniu P50-E1 is a very compact, lightweight power bank that offers very fast phone charging and can top up many laptops in a pinch.\n\nYou can buy the P50 directly from Iniu, Amazon, or various other marketplaces like eBay, though it isn't typically found in brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nList price is $32.99 / \u00a332.99 / AU$56.46, but it's often sold at much less during sale events, so it's well worth waiting for a discount if you don't need it right away.\n\nThe power bank has a class-leading 3-year warranty, giving extra peace of mind if you do happen to run into an issue.\n\nThe P50-E1 gives excellent results for such a compact power bank. Iniu has matched the cells well to the output and used an efficient voltage converter, so overall the power bank gives above-average results.\n\nOne thing to note: if you are using multiple ports at once, they are limited to a max of 7.5W each and 15W total. This means if you want to quickly top up a device, make sure it\u2019s the only one plugged into the P50.\n\nThe included short USB-C lanyard cable is e-marked for 5A (USB 2.0 data speeds) so it can happily handle the P50-E1\u2019s full 45W output. Keep in mind that if using another cable, make sure it is 5A-rated, as a typical 3A cable won\u2019t always allow you to unlock the P50\u2019s full potential.\n\nWhen pushed hard with a sustained maximum output until empty (when charging a laptop), the P50 reached a warm but not problematic 45\u00b0C (113\u00b0F), while phone charging only saw it reach 33\u00b0C (91\u00b0F).\n\nMy advice: feel free to charge your phone with the P50 tucked in a bag, but give it some open air when charging a laptop to help with heat.\n\nThe Iniu P50 is a great fast-charging 10,000 mAh (36Wh) power bank, but below are a few other options if you are looking for something different. For even more recommendations, check out our guide to the best power banks. Or, if you are planning a holiday soon, get a full rundown on the airline rules when traveling with power banks.\n\nI get hands-on with every power bank I test and conduct extensive evaluations in both lab and real-world scenarios. Using tools like the ChargerLab POWER-Z KM003C, I measure charge voltage, check protocol support, and log capacity tests.\n\nEach power bank is also tested with everyday devices, including phones, tablets, and laptops, and is connected to a programmable load tester for multiple charge cycles. I carry a selection daily in both pockets and bags to assess their durability and ability to withstand everyday use.\n\nAll measurements and weights are personally verified, ensuring accuracy beyond the manufacturer\u2019s listings. It\u2019s worth noting that many power bank reviews don\u2019t do this sort of testing, so they should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nWant to know more? Read about how we test.",

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nWith 20W fast-charge capability and a 10,000 mAh (37 Wh) capacity, the Iniu B6 is the perfect low-cost power bank to slip into your bag when on the go. It gives standout efficiency, has a number of unique features, and is backed by a leading three-year warranty.\nPros\n- +\nSlim and lightweight\n- +\n20W fast charging\n- +\nGreat value for money\nCons\n- -\nNo super fast charging\n- -\nScratches easily\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nIniu B6 power bank review\nThere are a lot of power banks on the market that seem great on paper, but it can be hard to know how they hold up in the real world. Iniu is one of my favourite brands thanks to very high-quality power banks with great features and a long warranty, but just as importantly, very reasonable prices. That said, when shopping online, the list price is often quite high, but the power bank is typically sold for much less.\nThe little Iniu B6 offers a lot considering the price tag, with a 10,000 mAh (37 Wh) capacity and a 20W (9V, 2.22A) PD 3.0 output, which will fast charge most phones fully at least once, with enough leftover for other devices or a second charge later on. The B6 measures 13.6 x 7 x 1.5 cm, weighs 210 grams \u2013 a better-than-average size and weight for the capacity, making it ideal for slipping into a pocket, purse or bag.\nThe B6 has a single USB-C port, as well as two USB-A ports and a large easy-to-read digital display that shows the capacity still available to use. In the box, you get a USB-A to USB-C cable and a carry bag \u2013 the latter is a nice inclusion, as the soft-touch coating on the B6 is great to hold but prone to scratches. The soft-touch coating also holds fingerprints and fluff, and I do worry that it might degrade and feel sticky in the future, but so far it's held up well.\nThe power bank has an LED torch that can be turned on by double pressing the power button. Sure, it\u2019s not very bright, but I've found it very useful for finding lost items in a dark bag. Plus, it will literally run for days \u2013 I often use it as a portable night light when travelling. For example, a bit of dim illumination is very helpful when trying to find the bathroom in a dark, unfamiliar hotel room, and avoids needing to turn on the main lights.\nThe B6 also has a pull-out phone holder that turns the power bank into a stand when charging \u2013 also very handy when travelling.\nIniu B6: Price & specs\nPrice | $25.93 / \u00a329.99 / AU$46.99 |\nCapacity | 10,000 mAh (37 Wh) |\nTotal Wattage | 20W |\nSingle Port Wattage | 20W |\nNumber of Ports | 3 |\nUSB-C | 1x in/out |\nUSB-A | 1 port |\nDimensions | 13.6 x 7 x 1.5 cm |\nWeight | 210g |\nPhone Charges | 1 to 2 times |\nIniu B6: Test results\nI conduct comprehensive testing of power banks to make sure they can meet the manufacturer's claims. All in all, the B6 gives excellent results that are well above average \u2013 especially considering the price.\nIn testing, the B6 has excellent voltage accuracy and can output 85% of its rated capacity at 20W (9V, 2.22A) and an even better 91% at 5V. These are very impressive results considering the affordable price. The B6 also supports PPS mode from 5V to 11V at 2A, and 5V to 5.9V at 3A, allowing compatible phones to charge faster and more efficiently. Note that while the B6 is listed as 22.5W, that's at 5V 4.5A (or 4.5V 5A) which isn't supported on most phones.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nI first tested this Iniu B6 back in May 2023, and have used it as one of my main power banks ever since. Along the way, I've performed periodic cyclic testing and have not turned up any appreciable capacity loss, so I am very confident that the B6 will last well long term. But of course, it\u2019s worth mentioning (again) that Iniu offers a generous three-year warranty, providing peace of mind if you do have an issue.\nTest | Usable Capacity | Efficiency | Score |\n|---|---|---|---|\n10W (5V, 2A) | 33.6 Wh | 91% | 4.5 / 5 |\n20W (9V, 2.22A) | 31.5 Wh | 85% | 4 / 5 |\n18W (12V, 1.5A) | 32.5 Wh | 82% | 3.5 / 5 |\nShould I buy the Iniu B6?\nBuy it if...\nYou need an affordable power bank\nThe B6 is one of the best-value power banks available, and is often on sale for even less from retailers like Amazon. The B6 offers features, specs, warranty and test results that are as good as premium power banks.\nYou plan to charge a phone\nThe 10,000 mAh capacity and 20W output is perfect for topping up small devices when on the go. It\u2019s also just the right size to slip into a bag and not even notice it\u2019s there.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou want to charge a laptop\nWhile great for charging small devices like phones, tablets and earbuds, a higher output power bank is a better option for laptops or handheld gaming devices.\nYou need to charge multiple devices\nThe 10,000 mAh capacity is perfect for topping up a phone, but if you want to charge multiple devices, a larger 20,000 mAh power bank is a better option.\nAlso consider\nThe Iniu B6 is one of the best affordable power banks available, but below are a few other options if you are looking for something different. Or for even more options, check out our guide to the best power banks.\nIniu B41 power bank\nThe B41 is slightly slimmer and lighter than the B6, but doesn\u2019t offer fast charging. Still, that\u2019s a perfectly fine trade-off depending on your charging needs.\nRead our full Iniu B41 power bank review\nIniu B5 20,000 mAh power bank\nFor those who like the look of the B6 but need a larger capacity, the Iniu B5 has the same number of ports and output voltages and amperage as the B6, but has a 20,000 mAh (74 Wh) battery. It includes the same torch, but no phone holder, and measures in at a larger 13.5 x 7.1 x 2.5 cm and weighs 362 grams.\nRead our full Iniu B5 power bank review\nHow I test power banks\nI get hands-on with every power bank I can, and perform extensive testing in both the lab and real-world scenarios. Using equipment like the ChargerLab POWER-Z KM003C, I check charge voltage, protocol support, and log capacity tests.\nEach power bank is also tested with real devices, including phones, tablets, laptops, and others, and connected to a programmable load tester for multiple charge cycles. I carry a selection daily in both pockets and bags to assess their durability and ability to withstand rough, everyday use.\nAll measurements and weights are personally verified, ensuring accuracy beyond the manufacturer\u2019s listings.\nWant to know more?

However, we always advise reading our reviews to learn if a product is right for your particular needs.\nThe final star rating is out of five, and reviewers can award half-star ratings if they feel a product falls between two of the ratings.\nOur review awards\nTechRadar has four product awards:\nEditor's Choice award\nThe Editor's Choice award goes to any product that gets a 5-star TechRadar review in accordance with our reviews guarantee.\nGreat Value award\nThe Great Value award is given to products that represent excellent value for money are thus worthy of consideration. This is not awarded alongside an Editor's Choice or Best in Class award, as excellent value for money is part of the criteria for those awards.\nBest in Class award\nThis award goes to the best product in any major reviews category.\nRecommended award\nA product that scores 4-stars or above is eligible to be considered for the Recommended award. While the product may be lacking in certain areas, it still demonstrates enough quality to be wholeheartedly recommended.\nOur hands-on reviews\nWe headline two different types of article with the word 'review' - 'hands-on reviews' and 'full product reviews.' It is important to distinguish between them.\nHands-on reviews are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours.\nThe important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.\nWe use the word 'review' here partly because we are giving a real opinion based on using it, and partly because readers increasingly use the word 'review' in searches when looking for these early views about a product.\nHowever, hands-on reviews are not the same as full product reviews. Our full product reviews are always based on the finished release product, which has been thoroughly tested and benchmarked and will always contain a full verdict and score.\nOur reviewers\nOur reviewers are specialists, each with expertise in a particular technology. With decades of combined experience reviewing technology under their belts, our team has consistently lived, breathed, and reviewed technology since TechRadar's conception in 2007.\nOur US Editor-in-Chief, Lance Ulanoff, has more than 30 years of experience as a technology journalist at a number of high-profile outlets, including Mashable and PCMag, and UK Editor-in-Chief Marc McLaren has more than 20 years of tech publishing experience on sites that include Tom's Guide and Stuff.\nHowever, that just scratches the surface of a diverse and far-reaching global team that spans four continents, 14 countries, and 11 different languages.\nThe result is a team with an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the areas they cover, ensuring our reviews not only give you an in-depth experience of each product but also the vital wider context, providing you with the exact information you need when it comes to making a buying decision.\nSpecialist expertise\nBecause our writers are specialists, they are constantly in touch with the communities they report on. That means our experts are able to rate products against others of the same type.\nTechRadar commissions our reviews only from those with the requisite level of expertise: from our own team of writers to other external experts when needed.\nWhat this means is if you see a review of a home theater system on TechRadar, you know it's been reviewed by an expert in home theater, not mobile phones.\nHow we test\nWe emphasize real world testing over labs, because that's where products get used. However, we benchmark every product that sells on the basis of specific performance indicators.\nFind out more about our testing procedures:"

      "text": "I\u2019m a power bank nerd and here are the airline rules you need to know\nTravel safe and keep your holiday out of the headlines\nPower banks are the unsung heroes of modern travel and quietly keep our phones alive through airport purgatory, train delays or sketchy hotel outlets. But they\u2019re also potentially quite dangerous if you treat them badly or buy the cheapest knockoff you can find online.\nThe airline industry knows this better than anyone (remember when Galaxy Note 7s kept catching fire?), and it\u2019s no surprise that the rules keep getting tighter. It\u2019s not just the skies \u2013 your power bank can cause havoc in a hot car or even at home if you ignore basic safety.\nTo help you holiday with some peace of mind and to cut through the boring technical jargon, I\u2019ve put together this guide that breaks down exactly what you need to know for safe travels with your power bank \u2013 whether you\u2019re flying to Shanghai, riding the Eurostar or taking the Greyhound to nowhere in particular.\nRead on as I explain the rules, the science and the common-sense steps that will stop your portable battery from turning your holiday into a headline. I\u2019ve also included a detailed FAQ that answers all the questions you didn\u2019t know to ask.\nOr, if you just want to upgrade before your next trip, check out our guide to the best power banks.\nPower bank basics\nSkip down to the airline rules and tips for safe travels if you already know your power bank terminology, or read on for a quick recap on power bank basics.\nAt its simplest, a power bank is a rechargeable battery, usually lithium-ion, inside a protective case with electronics that manage safe charging. The quality of those electronics and the materials used make the difference between a device that lasts for years and one that fails after a few trips. Power banks can range from tiny to huge and charge phones, laptops or even jump start a car.\nCapacity is often advertised in milliamp-hours (mAh), but airlines and transport regulators use watt-hours (Wh) to measure capacity. The Wh rating is usually printed on the back of the power bank, but if not, the conversion is straightforward: Wh = (mAh \u00f7 1000) \u00d7 voltage.\nMost modern power banks run at 3.7 volts, so a 10,000 mAh model works out to about 37 Wh. Don\u2019t feel like doing the math? Try our Wh calculator below.\nFor travel, remember that 100 Wh (27,000 mAh) is the common limit before special airline approval is needed, and anything over 160 Wh (43,000 mAh) is generally not permitted.\nThe design and build quality are important, so avoid any mystery brands on Amazon, even if the totally not-fake reviews look good. You can\u2019t go wrong with any of the options in our best power banks buyer's guide, or a model from brands like Anker, Iniu, CukTech, Ugreen and Baseus. Many even publish their own guides, such as this informative read from Anker.\nWe are also starting to see some manufacturers releasing power banks with LiFePO4 (lithium iron phosphate) batteries. These use a more thermally stable battery chemistry, but are slightly bulkier than models that use other typical lithium-ion types.\nThat said, even the best brands can sometimes have issues, so make sure to look out for any power bank recalls.\nIf you have an old power bank where the casing is cracked, swollen, getting hot or runs flat very quickly, it\u2019s best to replace it before traveling. Read more about what to do with an old power bank in our disposal guide below.\nPower bank don\u2019ts\n- Avoid exposing your power bank to extreme heat or cold (like leaving it in a car), as this can shorten its lifespan or damage it.\n- Don\u2019t buy a dodgy or unknown brand power bank.\n- Don\u2019t use a power bank that\u2019s cracked or starting to swell.\n- Avoid using a power bank inside a bag as it can overheat.\nHow to travel safely with your power bank\nPower banks are treated the same way by most airlines because the rules come from safety bodies like IATA (International Air Transport Association) and the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration). The good news is that the important points are pretty straightforward.\nTaking your power bank on a flight\nYou must keep power banks in your carry-on cabin bag. They are not allowed in checked luggage under any circumstances. If your bag is gate-checked, make sure to remove any power banks or spare batteries first.\nKnow your watt-hour limits\nUp to 100 Wh is generally fine without approval. Between 101 Wh and 160 Wh, you will need airline approval, and most carriers limit you to two units. Power banks over 160 Wh are generally not permitted on passenger flights.\nUnderstand why it matters\nLithium-ion batteries can overheat or fail if damaged. So, for safety, they need to be in the cabin where crew can deal with any issues quickly.\nNavigate the airline approval process\nIf your power bank is between 101 and 160 Wh, contact your airline well in advance and get confirmation in writing. Turn up without it and you risk losing the device at security check.\nKeep up with recent changes\nIn the last few months, many airlines have added new power bank and battery rules. Some prohibit power banks from being used while flying, which is a frustrating development. Others require them to be visible while charging. If flying domestically in China (excluding international arrivals), power banks need a 3C mark. I\u2019ve included a table of per airline rules (correct as of August 2025) near the end of the article.\nThese are the baseline rules, but for anything more complex, contact your airline well before you fly for any specific requirements they may have.\nSpecial situations\nWhat about different battery types, medical exemptions or other modes of travel? Don\u2019t worry, I have you covered.\nOther battery types\nThe same airline rules for capacity limits, approvals and carry-on requirements also apply to other rechargeable lithium batteries. This includes battery packs for cordless tools, camera gear, drones and, of course, high-capacity power banks between 101 and 160 Wh. If you are traveling with any of these larger batteries, you must contact your airline before the trip and get explicit approval in writing.\nMobility and medical devices\nBatteries used in mobility aids like electric wheelchairs or scooters, or in certain medical devices, are handled under separate rules. They often have higher capacity allowances if the battery is essential for health or mobility, but you\u2019ll still need to declare them in advance and follow the airline\u2019s packing and handling instructions. If you fall under this category, contact your airline well ahead of your flight and confirm the requirements.\nDifferent modes of transport\nTrains, buses and ferries generally allow high-capacity power banks and other lithium batteries, but some operators have their own limits. International services may apply airline-style rules, so check before you travel. Even without formal restrictions, store batteries securely and follow the same basic safety practices you would for air travel.\nA checklist for traveling with power banks safely\n- Check the capacity: Look for the watt-hour rating (or calculate it) and confirm it\u2019s within airline limits.\n- Inspect for damage: Do not travel with a power bank that\u2019s cracked, swollen, leaking or overheating.\n- Get approval if needed: Contact your airline in advance for any power bank between 101 Wh and 160 Wh and carry written proof of approval.\n- Verify airline rules: Check your airline\u2019s policy in case there are extra requirements or restrictions for your flight.\n- Pack it properly: Keep power banks in your carry-on in a place that\u2019s protected yet easy to access.\nFrequently asked questions\nBelow are some answers to the most common questions about traveling safely with power banks.\nAre power banks allowed in checked bags?\nNo, they must be in your carry-on.\nWhat does the 100 Wh rule actually mean?\nUp to 100 Wh capacity is fine without approval; 101 to 160 Wh needs airline approval; over 160 Wh is typically prohibited on passenger flights.\nHow do I convert mAh to Wh if it\u2019s not printed on my power bank?\nWh = (mAh \u00f7 1000) \u00d7 voltage. Most power banks use 3.7 V, so 10,000 mAh is 37 Wh.\nIs a 20,000 mAh power bank allowed on a plane?\nYes, 20,000 mAh is 74 Wh and is under the 100 Wh limit.\nIs a 30,000 mAh power bank allowed?\n30,000 mAh is 111 Wh and needs airline approval, though it's often limited to two units.\nDo airlines really check the watt-hour label?\nThey can, and the airline or airport security may not allow a power bank if the Wh cannot be confirmed.\nHow many sub-100 Wh power banks can I bring?\nThere is no universal limit, but many airlines limit you to 2 or 4.\nDo I need to cover or tape terminals on power banks?\nSpare batteries (like for drones, cameras or tools) must be protected from short circuits \u2013 like with tape, bags or pouches, but you don\u2019t need to tape power banks in your carry on.\nAre tool and drone batteries treated differently?\nAside from protecting the battery terminals, they typically follow the same carry-on and capacity rules as power banks.\nCan I use a power bank during the flight?\nMostly yes. It depends on the airline \u2013 many ban in-flight use or require the power bank to be visible.\nDo non-lithium batteries have the same rules?\nStandard dry cells like AA or AAA can go in carry-on or checked luggage, as long as the terminals are protected.\nAre smart suitcases with built-in batteries OK?\nOnly if the battery is removable, is under the Wh limits and is placed in your carry-on.\nCan Bluetooth trackers like Apple Airtags be left in checked baggage?\nYes \u2013 small Bluetooth trackers with coin-cell batteries, such as Apple AirTags, are generally allowed in checked baggage because they are low power and within lithium battery limits.\nDo I need airline approval for laptop power banks with AC outlets?\nNo, unless they are 101 to 160 Wh, or higher.\nIs there a rule about discharging a power bank before flying?\nNo, your power bank can be fully charged when flying.\nWhere should I keep a power bank in the cabin?\nSomewhere easily accessible and not in a confined space where it could overheat. Many airlines don\u2019t allow power banks in the overhead lockers, so it\u2019s best to keep them in the seat pocket in front of you.\nWhat if my bank has no printed Wh value?\nIt\u2019s best to bring documentation (like the manual) or calculate it yourself.\nAre wireless or solar power banks treated differently?\nNo, they are still power banks and follow the same rules.\nCan batteries that are installed in devices go in my checked baggage?\nIn some cases, yes, but they must be protected from accidental activation and generally are better to have in your carry-on. Contact your airline for specifics.\nWhat about medical or mobility device batteries?\nThey can have higher battery capacity limits but must be declared and approved in advance.\nDo different countries use the same rules?\nMost follow IATA standards, but airlines can be stricter. Asian airlines tend to have more rules restricting power bank use on planes.\nDo airlines add the capacities together across multiple power banks?\nNo. Capacity limits apply per power bank, not as a combined total, though some airlines limit the total number of devices you can have.\nHow do I get airline approval for 101 to 160 Wh and what proof should I bring?\nMost major airlines have an online form you can fill out. If in doubt, contact your airline well before you fly, and be prepared to provide the watt-hour rating and photos of the label.\nDo I need to remove power banks or chargers from my bag during security screening?\nUsually you can leave them in your carry-on, but some airports ask you to remove batteries or large electronics, so keep them accessible and follow staff instructions.\nIs any country or authority stricter than the 100 Wh baseline?\nMost use the 100 Wh limit, but some airlines add extra conditions like quantity limits or in-flight use bans, so always check your specific carrier.\nWhat happens if I accidentally packed a power bank in checked baggage?\nTell airline staff immediately so the bag can be retrieved and the power bank removed, since flying with it in the plane\u2019s cargo hold is not allowed. If you don\u2019t, the checked baggage security screening will stop your bag from being loaded onto the plane.\nIf I have airline approval noted on my booking, can security still stop me and how do I present it?\nYes, security can still ask questions, so carry printed or digital proof that shows your name, flight, power bank watt-hours and the airline contact who approved it.\nFor China domestic flights, will non-3C power banks be confiscated after arriving on an international flight?\nYou can enter China with a non-3C power bank, but it will not be permitted on domestic flights and may be confiscated or refused at security.\nPower bank disposal\nYou can\u2019t just throw batteries into the bin, and old or damaged power banks can cause fires in landfill and garbage trucks. Fortunately, getting rid of an old or damaged power bank isn\u2019t as tricky as you\u2019d think if you follow a few basic steps.\nHow to dispose of an old or malfunctioning power bank\n- Recycle through an e-waste or battery recycling program.\n- Carefully check it for any signs of damage or malfunction.\n- Tell recycling staff if it\u2019s swollen, leaking or has overheated.\n- Don\u2019t put a power bank in household rubbish or standard curbside recycling.\n- Do not charge or use a damaged or malfunctioning power bank.\n- If a power bank starts to smoke or catches fire, call emergency services.\nPower bank and battery recycling schemes\nUSA | Call2Recycle | |\nUSA | Staples in-store battery recycling | |\nUSA | Batteries Plus battery recycling | |\n| Row 3 - Cell 0 | Row 3 - Cell 1 | Row 3 - Cell 2 |\nUK | Recycle Now | |\nUK | Recycle Your Electricals | |\nUK | Currys in-store recycling | |\n| Row 7 - Cell 0 | Row 7 - Cell 1 | Row 7 - Cell 2 |\nAustralia | B-cycle national battery scheme | |\nAustralia | Planet Ark Recycling | |\nAustralia | Bunnings national battery recycling |\nAirline power bank policies\nThe info below is current as of August 2025, but remember that airlines can update their rules at any time.

Anker 733 Power Bank (GaNPrime PowerCore 65W)\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You travel a lot and need power: We never take flight without the Anker 733 in our carry on luggage. It replaces multiple wall chargers and gives us a large battery on the go.\n\u2705 You carry a small laptop and a phone: The Anker 733 is powerful enough to charge a laptop and a phone together. Or you can charge your phone, headphones, and smartwatch all at once.\n\u274c You want a more portable option: Because of its combo nature, the Anker 733 is a bit bulky and cumbersome, but if you use it both ways, it's worth the trade-off in size to have such a useful device.\n\u274c You only want to charge a phone: If you don't need to charge a laptop occasionally, or you only carry a phone with no accessories, the Anker 733 is more than you need.\nThe Anker 733 is a revelation, and though it isn't the most powerful or feature packed power bank on this list, it was the best overall power bank we carried when we needed to charge multiple devices, no matter what those devices might be.\nIn our tests, it charged an iPhone 15 at full 20W speed, and it power a Chromebook and small laptops like a Macbook Air whether it's plugged into a wall or not.\nSpeaking of that wall plug, it's the most useful feature ever on a power bank. Some power banks come with a built in USB-C cord, but this Anker comes with a two-prong power outlet plug. That makes it a wall charger as well as a power bank, and the utility can't be understated.\nYou might think that adding a 65W wall charger to a power bank would add a lot of bulk. Well, you're right, the Anker 733 is big, and it's power-to-weight ratio isn't as high as the heavy hitters on this list. On the other hand, we charged the battery and three devices in the wall, then simply removed the Anker 733 and kept charging those devices with the built-in battery.\nThe Anker 733 has a 10,000 mAh battery inside, which is just shy of enough power to charge our iPhone 15 to 100% twice. It charged our big Galaxy S23 Ultra to 100% once, then lifted the battery to around 30% again.\nThere are two USB-C ports on the Anker 733, and both are capable of 65W charging when the power bank is plugged in to a wall outlet, or 30W when the battery is running the show. There's also a USB-A port for legacy devices. You can charge the Anker 733 by plugging it into the wall or you can plug in one of the USB-C ports to charge the battery.\nThe best magnetic power bank\n2. Anker MagGo Power Bank (10K)\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a premium MagSafe power bank: The Anker MagGo power bank looks and feels ultra premium. The display shows battery life as a percentage, which is obviously useful, and time remaining, so you know how much juice is left.\n\u2705 You want a durable power bank: The Anker MagGo power bank feels sturdy and solid, with a strong magnet capable of holding onto an iPhone tightly. The flip stand even felt secure.\n\u274c You want a lighted battery: This isn\u2019t a very light or thin power bank, so it may bulge in your pocket if you try to charge on the go.\n\u274c You have an Android: Unless your Android phone lines up perfectly with Apple's MagSafe magnets, skip this one and get a battery pack without magnets instead.\nThe Anker MagGo Power Bank (10K) is a versatile charging solution with a 10,000mAh capacity, capable of delivering 27W of wired power and 15W wirelessly. Its key feature is MagSafe compatibility, allowing it to magnetically attach to iPhones from the iPhone 12 series onwards for secure and efficient charging.\nThe strong magnetic hold supports both vertical and horizontal mounting, and despite the unpadded wireless zone, it didn't scratch my phone or power bank during my review period.\nAdding to its functionality, the MagGo Power Bank incorporates a foldable stand, providing a stable platform for propping up your iPhone during charging or content viewing. This thoughtful design element enhances its usability beyond basic charging.\nIn our tests, the Anker MagGo Power Bank charged an iPhone 13 Pro from 50% to 100% in approximately two hours, suggesting a full charge in roughly four hours. This process depleted the power bank to 73%, so we figure it can deliver multiple phone charges.\nA smart display provides useful information, showing the power bank's battery level and estimated remaining running time or charging time. However, this estimation tends to fluctuate, making it somewhat unreliable.\nThe MagGo Power Bank boasts a sleek and understated design with a robust build and premium materials, contributing to its overall durability. While it may be somewhat thick and heavy, its reliable charging performance and convenient smart readout make it a suitable travel companion. However, its size might make it less ideal for carrying in a pocket with an iPhone attached.\nThe best power bank for phones and more\n3. Iniu PD 22.5w 20000mAh\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a big battery for less money: While some power banks offer slightly higher capacity, they often come with a significantly higher price tag for a marginal gain in charging power. This option strikes an excellent balance between cost and capacity.\n\u2705 You want to charge a phone plus accessories: Equipped with USB-C and dual USB-A ports, the Iniu PD power bank provides simultaneous charging for multiple devices like phones, earbuds, and much more.\n\u274c You want to charge as fast as possible: Despite its 20000mAh capacity, the Iniu PD power bank has a maximum output of 22.5W. This charging speed falls short of the capabilities of many modern Android phones.\n\u274c You want a more compact battery: Weighing 12.8oz (363g), the Iniu PD 22.5w 20000mAh power bank is quite hefty. While pocketable, its weight might make it cumbersome for everyday carry. Consider lighter alternatives if portability is a priority.\nWith a big 20,000mAh Lithium Polymer battery, this power bank delivered multiple charges for all our devices. In our real-world testing, charging an iPhone 12 Pro to 100% once daily for three days depleted the power bank to only 54%, and we think this equals a week's worth of charge for typical usage.\nThe power bank supports 22.5W charging, which is fine for iPhones but falls short of the faster charging speeds supported by today's best Android phones (the OnePlus Nord 4 can charge up to 100W). It's also not powerful enough to charge a MacBook.\nEquipped with a USB-C port and two standard USB ports, the Iniu PD 22.5w 20000mAh allows simultaneous charging of up to three devices. This multi-device charging capability makes it versatile for users who carry multiple gadgets.\nWe really liked its sleek design. An LCD screen clearly displays the remaining charge, providing precise monitoring of power levels.\nThis power bank is relatively bulky and heavy. It lacks IP weatherproofing, so keep it dry. However, it's still pocketable and proved durable enough to withstand a music festival, including a day of heavy rain.\nThe Iniu PD 22.5w 20000mAh power bank excels in providing ample power at an affordable price. While it may not offer the fastest charging speeds or advanced features like wireless charging, its substantial capacity and multi-device charging capabilities make it a good option for users who want to keep multiple devices charged.\nThe best power bank value\n4. Iniu B61 10000mAh\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You just got a new iPhone and want the perfect accessory: What better way to celebrate having a USB-C port than buying a new power bank that uses it well.\n\u2705 You want a power bank that fits in a small pocket: The Anker Nano is the smallest power bank on our list, but it packs a big wallop for its small size, and that fold-down USB-C plug makes it easier to carry.\n\u274c You need to charge back up to 100%: The Anker Nano carries a respectable 5,000 mAh of battery life, but the power lost in charging means it can't get an iPhone 15 or Galaxy S23 back to full power in a single charge.\n\u274c You want to charge old stuff: We're not bothered by the lack of USB-A ports on this small charger, but if your watch or headphones requires it, every other charger on this list has on (including the water bottle charger).\nEverybody on our gift list who got a new iPhone is going to get an Anker Nano Power Bank (22.5W) this year. This cute little charger is perfectly sized to sit beneath your favorite smartphone, plugged into the USB-C port with a little plug that opens out or hides away for a sleek look.\nThe Anker Nano is only 5,000mAh, but that doesn't mean it can fully charge a 5,000mAh phone battery like you'll find in the Galaxy S23 Ultra. Power banks are about 60-70% efficient, depending on the phone's technology, so in our tests this power bank could charge an iPhone 15 to nearly full, but that big Ultra only got about 65% charge.\nThat's just fine, because this power bank was the perfect pocket companion to keep us going through a busy day. If you need more power, you'll have to carry a bag to hold a big battery, but the Anker Nano gave us enough power for busy digital living, without added bulk.\nIn fact, this is the most efficient battery on our list, in terms of power-to-weight ratios. At only 100g, the Anker Nano is the smallest, but it still packs in plenty of power for that weight. You could buy six Nano power banks and have more power for less weight than buying the big Anker Prime.\nThe Anker Nano used to be available in an Apple Lightning version, but those days are thankfully behind us. No matter what phone you are using, especially if you're enjoying the new iPhone 15, this is the power bank you should keep on you.\nBefore you buy, why not check out the latest Anker promo codes?\nThe best power bank for laptops\n5. Anker Laptop Power Bank\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You have multiple large devices\nAll of the Anker Laptop Power Bank's three USB-C outputs can charge up to 100W, which is plenty of power for most modern laptops and tablets.\n\u2705 You forget that essential cord\nWith two integrated USB-C cables, one of which doubles as a carrying handle, this power bank offers handy cords if you often forget your own.\n\u274c You need something lighter\nWeighing more than a pound (more than half a kilo), the Anker Laptop Power Bank isn't light. You won't be able to stuff this one into a pocket, for sure.\n\u274c You don't need a lot of power\nThat 165W output and 25,000mAh capacity will be overkill if you only need to charge your phone and your earbuds, not a laptop.\nThe Anker Laptop Power Bank is a robust solution for charging high-powered devices on the move, offering a substantial 165W output and a 25,000mAh capacity. While it's made for heavy-duty use, it maintains a relatively slim profile, though its weight and thickness are considerable.\nOur reviewer loved the integrated display, which provides real-time readouts of temperature and wattage for each of the four outputs, a feature not usually found on competing power banks.\nThe power bank includes one USB-C and one USB-A port on its side, along with two innovative built-in cables. One cable forms a loop that doubles as a carrying handle, while the other is retractable and magnetically secures to the base. Both cables are thick and durable, with robust support, effectively minimizing cable clutter and eliminating the need to carry separate cables.\nPerformance-wise, the Anker Laptop Power Bank delivered impressive charging speeds in our testing. All three USB-C outputs support up to 100W, and the device charged my M3 MacBook Pro and iPhone 16 to 50% in approximately 30 minutes. Real-time wattage tracking is displayed during charging.\nIn my lab tests, a full recharge of the power bank itself took just 90 minutes. It can also charge four devices simultaneously, with a maximum output of 130W, and includes a trickle charging mode for low-power devices.\nPriced at $99 / \u00a389, the Anker Laptop Power Bank offers excellent value for its power, versatility, and convenience. For users who frequently travel with large devices and require reliable portable power, this power bank is a solid and dependable companion.\nThe best magnetic stand power bank\n6. Ugreen Uno Magnetic Wireless Power Bank 10000mAh 15W\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want fast-charging\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking that Ugreen simply made a novelty, cutesy MagSafe power bank, but I'm delighted to say they've created a charger that's as fast as it is cute.\n\u2705 You want something whimsical\nIt's not for everyone, but if you appreciate adorable and eccentric things, like me, these emoji battery symbols will make you smile.\n\u274c You want something super compact\nIf you want a super slim option that's barely noticeable while attached to your iPhone, look for something thinner than this one.\n\u274c You need total reliability\nMy sample didn't always charge my phone after I'd attached it to the MagSafe pad. We'll keep testing in case reliablity is a long-term issue for this brand.\nThe Ugreen Uno Magnetic Wireless Power Bank 10000mAh 15W distinguishes itself with its whimsical, emoji-based display, though its aesthetic may not appeal to everyone. If you want a MagSafe power bank with a touch of personality, this device is a compelling option. It helps that we've seen frequent discounts from its official list price of $69.99 / \u00a364.99.\nIn terms of size and weight, the Ugreen Uno strikes a balance, neither overly bulky nor compact. The device features a combination of soft-touch silicone for the MagSafe charging surface and metallic plastic for the casing. An integrated metal stand provides support for the power bank so you can use your phone in Standby mode while it's charging.\nThe power bank\u2019s most distinctive feature is its smart display, which uses emoji faces to indicate battery levels. These animated expressions can easily be disabled if you're not in the mood.\nCharging performance was impressive, and the Ugreen Uno fully charged my iPhone 13 Pro in under two hours, making it one of the fastest MagSafe power banks we've tested. The combination of rapid charging and the unique emoji display makes the Ugreen Uno a worthy contender if you're looking for effective wireless charging that also happens to be cute.\nThe best power user power bank\n7. Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (250W)\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the absolute best power bank: It has an app to monitor charging details, enough power to drive a MacBook or two, and fast recharging using both USB-C ports. Truly an unmatched power bank.\n\u2705 You need power for days and days: You could leave with your iPhone 15 on a Monday and use only this battery until you return on Friday. It has enough juice for days of charging, not hours.\n\u274c You don't need all those extras: The Anker Prime power bank is pricey, and if you don't care about monitoring charge Wattage or days of battery life, find another option.\n\u274c You want a compact battery: The Anker Prime power bank has a very high power-to-weight ratio (PWR), but it's still the heaviest battery on this list. It's more than three times the weight of our bargain pick.\nThe Anker Prime series of Power Banks, including the Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (250W) and the Anker Prime 20,000mAh Power Bank (200W), are for people who truly love to geek out on power banks. If you came looking for the absolute best power bank you can buy, this is the best we've tried.\nFirst, let's start with the raw power. The big Anker Prime powered our MacBook Pro and other big testing laptops: it's USB-C ports are capable of 140W of power individually, and the entire battery pack can crank out 250W divided between the two USB-C and one USB-A port.\nYou can also charge the Anker Prime using both USB-C ports at the same time, for a combined recharging rate up to 170W. That means you can completely refill this whopping 27K mAh battery in under 40 minutes. I thankfully had an Anker 737 GaN Prime charger that was up to the task, and it's fun to see the percentage climb.\nThink this is an amazing power bank? We're just getting started. The Anker Prime power bank has a built-in display, and it's no cheap LCD, it's a sharp OLED that gives you detailed information about the power going out or coming into the power bank. If that's not enough, there's also an Anker app you can download that gives you even more information about the battery on your smartphone.\nThat app is essential because there's a Find My feature built into the battery. It doesn't work like an AirTag over UWB, it's only Bluetooth, but it's useful if you misplace your battery in your office (or you have multiple batteries, like I do).\nIn terms of charging, this massive power bank can charge an iPhone 15 more than five times. It can charge a big Galaxy S23 Ultra's 5,000mAh battery three-and-a-half times. Best of all, it charges at the fastest speed available on most of your favorite phones (excluding Oppo/OnePlus's unusual SUPERVOOC battery).\nIs the Anker Prime worth the high price? That's hard to say, since the larger battery has suffered from some availability issues, though the smaller version packs most of the same features, including the same maximum 140W charging speed in each USB-C port. If you want the best and you love to know about the power your devices are drawing, the Anker Prime Power Bank is the one to buy.\nThe best mini power bank\n8. Anker Nano Power Bank (22.5W)\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You just got a new iPhone and want the perfect accessory: What better way to celebrate having a USB-C port than buying a new power bank that uses it well.\n\u2705 You want a power bank that fits in a small pocket: The Anker Nano is the smallest power bank on our list, but it packs a big wallop for its small size, and that fold-down USB-C plug makes it easier to carry.\n\u274c You need to charge back up to 100%: The Anker Nano carries a respectable 5,000 mAh of battery life, but the power lost in charging means it can't get an iPhone 15 or Galaxy S23 back to full power in a single charge.\n\u274c You want to charge old stuff: We're not bothered by the lack of USB-A ports on this small charger, but if your watch or headphones requires it, every other charger on this list has on (including the water bottle charger).\nEverybody on our gift list who got a new iPhone is going to get an Anker Nano Power Bank (22.5W) this year. This cute little charger is perfectly sized to sit beneath your favorite smartphone, plugged into the USB-C port with a little plug that opens out or hides away for a sleek look.\nThe Anker Nano is only 5,000mAh, but that doesn't mean it can fully charge a 5,000mAh phone battery like you'll find in the Galaxy S23 Ultra. Power banks are about 60-70% efficient, depending on the phone's technology, so this power bank is good for charging an iPhone 15 to nearly full, but that big Ultra will only get about 65% charge.\nThat's just fine, because this power bank is the perfect pocket companion to keep you going through a busy day. If you need more power, you'll have to carry a bag to hold a big battery, but the Anker Nano gives you enough power for busy digital living, without added bulk.\nIn fact, this is the most efficient battery on our list, in terms of power-to-weight ratios.

No matter what phone you are using, especially if you're enjoying the new iPhone 15, this is the power bank you should keep on you.\nBefore you buy, why not check out the latest Anker promo codes?\nThe best cheap MagSafe power bank\n9. Baseus Magnetic Foldable Power Bank 20W 10000mAh\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a powerful magnetic charger: The Baseus Magnetic Foldable Power Bank is a high-capacity battery built onto a very strong magnet. It holds onto an iPhone tightly, even in landscape mode.\n\u2705 You want a portable StandBy dock: If you have an iPhone 12 or newer running iOS 17, you can use the Baseus Magnetic Foldable as a dock for your iPhone in StandBy mode, giving you a cool desk clock with notifications or a digital photo frame.\n\u274c You don't have a magnetic phone: You don't need an iPhone to enjoy the magnetic charging, but you'll need a case that lines up your phone with Apple's MagSafe wireless configuration, or else your phone won't charge properly.\n\u274c You need to charge quickly: The Baseus Magnetic Foldable Power Bank is a strong magnet and a big battery, but it charges very slowly, whether wired or wireless. If you don't mind your iPhone wearing a backpack, that's not a problem.\nThere are plenty of wireless power bank options on the market, but the Baseus Magnetic Foldable Power Bank impressed me with its incredibly strong magnet. I have the official Apple MagSafe battery pack, and it's magnetic attraction is much weaker than this Baseus power bank. While the Apple battery fell off my phone occasionally, the Baseus Magnetic power bank held tight with less worry.\nThat means I could twist my phone sideways into landscape mode and use the Baseus power bank as a portable stand for Apple's new StandBy mode, which is one of my favorite features on iOS 17, and certainly the one I use the most often.\nThe Baseus Magnetic power bank can't charge very quickly; the company says it can only charge an iPhone at 7.5W, which is half the wattage a MagSafe iPhone is capable of handling. That was not problem, because this is a power bank that can stick to your phone for a while, so speed won't be of the essence.\nFor the price and performance, the slower charging speed is a fine trade off. The Baseus Magnetic Foldable power bank had the second highest power-to-weight ratio on our list, and Baseus chargers are potent and affordable, a good mix.\nIf you have more than just your smartphone to charge, the Baseus Magnetic power bank has a USB-C port as well, and it can charge up to 20W, which is faster than the magnetic charging, if you really need a speed boost.\nWith 10,000 mAh inside, it can charge an iPhone 15 to 100% just short of twice. A Galaxy S23 Ultra will get back to 100% charge once with an extra 35% or so on top of that.\nThe best bargain power bank\n10. Baseus Airpow Power Bank 20W 10000mAh\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need more power for less money: The Baseus Airpow power bank starts at $20 in the US and is on sale often, so it's a real steal.\n\u2705 You need more than one USB port: Most batteries with this many USB ports cost much more, so having two USB-C and one USB-A port will help you charge everything you carry.\n\u274c You're trying to keep it simple: The Baseus Airpow doesn't have any built in wires or wireless charging, so you'll need to carry extras when it's time to power up.\n\u274c You want to charge fast: While the 20W charging is respectable and can keep up with the new iPhone 15 USB-C port, most Android phones can charge faster than that, so a faster battery pack would help.\nIf you haven't heard of Baseus, the company makes a healthy lineup of affordable, well-designed battery packs that don't feel nearly as cheap as their prices would indicate. The most affordable of the bunch, the so-called Airpow Power Bank, starts at $20 in the US but is available on sale often.\nWith three USB ports, including a USB-C port capable of 20W charging and a USB-A port for legacy devices, this battery is surprisingly feature-packed for such an inexpensive power bank.\nThe Airpow is not a small power bank, but Baseus makes efficient gear that doesn't take up too much space. It's power-to-weight ratio is on par with the best battery packs from Anker and others. At 245g (more than half a pound), it's bulky, and you'll need to carry extra wires, but it's sleek and nice looking enough to keep in a hand bag.\nWith 10,000mAh of power inside, the Baseus Airpow can charge an iPhone 15 once to 100% then once again to nearly full. It can charge a Galaxy S23 Ultra to full once, then add another quarter of a charge.\nIt's not the fastest battery, but that's expected for this price range. While a flagship phone like the Galaxy S23 Ultra can accept a charging speed up to 45W, the Baseus Airpow can only hit 20W maximum. That's enough for the iPhone 15, though the iPhone 15 Pro has an unpublished charging speed in excess of 20W.\nIf you need more, Baseus has plenty of options available in a range of capacity sizes with a variety of features. The options aren't quite as fast or polished as the best power banks from Anker, but the prices are better, and Baseus doesn't add more bulk for less bucks.\nThe best Apple Watch power bank\n11. Otterbox 2-in-1 Power Bank with Apple Watch Charger\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You worry more about your Apple Watch battery: Big iPhones have a big battery, but your watch might not last the day. You don't need a big phone battery when this cute 2-in-1 charger makes a great option instead.\n\u2705 You want your watch to be a desk clock: The Apple Watch has a charging made that makes it a small clock, and this battery turns your watch into a timekeeper that won't get in the way while you're typing, while also keeping your battery full.\n\u274c You have a watch that isn't from Apple: The Otterbox 2-in-1 Power Bank only attaches magnetically to the Apple Watch. Other smartwatches, like the Pixel Watch, won't work with this one, not at all.\n\u274c You need power for your phone: The 3,000mAh battery inside is plenty to keep your Apple Watch going, but that isn't enough power to get you even halfway charged on an iPhone 15, and even less on bigger phones.\nThe Otterbox 2-in-1 Power Bank with Apple Watch is a unique solution to a common problem. Our phones lasts longer than ever before, but wearable batteries haven't quite caught up to the all-day promise. With this cute little power bank, we didn't need to carry the special Apple Watch charging cable or a larger battery. This little doodad does the trick.\nThe front of the battery is a magnet, and it can hold the Apple Watch standing up. The Apple Watch offers a standby screen with a clock when it's charging, making this power bank effectively a small desk clock, which can be a useful tool if you need to keep time but hate wearing a watch while you type.\nUnfortunately, that magnet isn't quite strong enough for the fanciest Apple Watch bands I own. I have a gorgeous titanium Apple Watch band sent from Nomad, and it was too heavy to hang onto the Otterbox Power Bank's magnet, even though its titanium is incredibly lightweight compared to other metal bands. That's not a big surprise, there are a few chargers this larger band won't fit.\nFrankly, the power-to-weight ratio for this little power bank isn't very impressive, it's heavy for the slim 3,000mAh power that it offers. Instead of efficiency, you get to leave your extra-long, super-annoying Apple Watch cable at home and instead just pop your watch onto this cute little thing. It's a worthwhile trade, at least if Watch power is your biggest concern.\nThere isn't quite enough power in the Otterbox 2-in-1 power bank to recharge a phone fully, but you're welcome to try. Besides the Apple Watch magnet, it also has a USB-C port that can charge up to 15W, so you can feed some headphones or get a few more hours of screen time in a pinch.\nThe best combo power bank\n12. Tylt Bottle 2\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You were already planning on carrying both: A lot of people carry a water bottle every day, and often bring a power bank along for extra charging. Why not carry both in one device?\n\u2705 You work or study from a library or cafe: The Tylt Bottle 2 is really the perfect device for students in a library or working from a cafe. Rest your phone on the wireless puck and let it charge while you work, without fussy wires and outlets.\n\u274c You need a lot of power: Thankfully, the battery on the Tylt Bottle 2 isn't so big it adds too much weight, but that also means it isn't powerful enough for multiple charges.\n\u274c You need fast power: This is a very slow charger, whether wired or wireless, so it's better for casual charging while you sip your water and read a book.\nThere are plenty of combination power bank and some other device, but the Tylt Bottle 2 actually makes sense because we're usually carrying an insulated water bottle anyway, so we might as well screw a battery onto the bottom. With a 5,700mAh capacity, the Tylt Bottle 2 is just enough to get us through a very busy day, or keep the phone powered while we play games at the cafe.\nThe bottle is actually a nice, insulated affair, and it kept ice in cold water for 12 hours, which is all that we need. It has a good, strong strap to carry the bottle, though we would have liked a lid that was easier for sipping.\nYou can buy the Tylt Bottle with just a power bank attached, but our review sample from AT&T had the full wireless charging treatment. It's easy to set up a phone to charge while studying, working out, or working away from home: all places we take a water bottle and need a full phone battery.\nTylt could have just added a wireless charging feature and called it a day, but the Tylt Bottle 2 has a few surprises on board. First of all, in addition to wireless charging, you still get both a USB-C and USB-A port for charging just about anything you have.\nTylt also wisely left enough of a gap between the battery and the bottle that you can coil a small USB-C cord (included) into that space. That way, even if you're not charging wirelessly, you're not adding a lot of extra bulk to your bag. It's a smart setup.\nAdmittedly, making a battery that also fills up with water is a quick way to make a heavy battery, so we won't knock Tylt for being a heavy power bank. If you were already carrying both, the Tylt Bottle 2 power bank insulated water bottle combo is a fun, smart way to keep your kit charged.\nThis bottle isn't available on Amazon, but you can find it elsewhere, including directly from AT&T as one of the accessories they offer when you buy a phone. Maybe that means we'll see it offered in a bundle deal sometime soon.\nHow to choose the best power bank for you\nHow much power does a power bank really give me?\nOur testing shows that a power bank can offer your phone about 70% of the power it contains. It loses the rest due to the inefficiency of the power transfer. That means a 5,000 mAh battery can fully charge a phone with a 3,500 mAh battery, like an iPhone 16. If you have a phone with a large 5,000 mAh battery inside, you'll need a power bank that holds at least 7,200 mAh of power to charge your phone fully.\nHow fast can a power bank charge my phone?\nIf you want to get the fastest charging speed from a power bank, you need to make sure that it is charging at the same wattage as your phone's USB-C power port. Most phone makers publish their charging speed. Samsung phones charge at 45W. Apple iPhones usually charge around 25W. A Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 can charge up to 68W. If you buy a battery that can charge at the same wattage, you will be able to charge your phone in the fastest possible time.\nWhat's the difference between cheap power banks and name brands?\nWhen it comes to power and electricity, we don't mess around. We want a brand that is well-known and accountable for its products. Cheap batteries can start fires. We only list brands that we know and trust, and we have connected with each of these companies to make sure we know the people behind them. Then we test the products thoroughly in our labs to make sure they stand up to our durability testing and the manufacturer's performance claims.\nAre certain power bank brands more reliable than others?\nYes, the brands that we have included are the most reliable brands you will find, and you can buy any of the products these companies make knowing that we have tested them for reliability and durability. Some companies, like Anker, have more advanced charging technology thanks to years of research and development, but all of the brands we recommend make reliable products.\nHow do I choose the best power bank for me?\nIf you are charging a small smartphone, a simple power bank will suffice. If you plan on charging a laptop occasionally as well, or many devices at once, you'll want a power bank with more power and more features.\nIf you have a newer Android phone, or the latest iPhone models, you'll want a power bank with faster charging speeds to get your battery full faster.\nYou can also find a power bank that charges your phone (or even your Apple Watch) wirelessly. These will usually charge slower, but they can be very convenient if you want to leave wires at home.\nWhich power bank is the best quality?\nAnker makes the best power banks we have tested so far, but batteries from Baseus and Otterbox also performed well. All of the power banks on this list passed our testing, traveling with us on the road and powering our devices at home.\nAnker is the best in part because it packs more power into its batteries at a lower weight. Its batteries charge faster than competitors. Its small Anker Nano battery has the best power-to-weight ratio of any battery on our list.\nWhich brand is best for power banks in 2025?\nAnker is making some the best power banks right. It offers the best power-to-weight ratio, the fastest charging, and the most useful features. We have also been impressed by power banks from Iniu, which have done very well in our hands-on tests.\nHow many times can my power bank charge my phone?\nA 10,000mAh battery will give your phone around 6,000mAh of extra battery charge. That means a 10,000mAh battery can charge that phone twice ... almost. You may not get to 100% the second charge, but you'll be in the 90% range.\nAny power bank that is 5,000mAh or smaller will probably not guarantee 100% charge on an iPhone 16 or larger phone. If you have a big battery phone like the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which packs 5,000mAh inside, you'll need a power bank closer to 8,000mAh or more if you want a full recharge.\nHow we test the best power banks\nWe have tested the best power banks by using them to charge a variety of devices, including Apple iPhone, Google Pixel, and Samsung Galaxy phones. We have also charged Apple iPad tablets, and small laptops including a Pixelbook Go and a Surface Laptop Go.\nWe used the best power banks extensively while traveling to see how well they fit in our luggage and their relative utility versus the weight add to our pack.\nUsing the Anker Prime power bank, we were also able to test the charging speed claims of other power banks, as the Anker Prime will report charging speed in wattage.\n- Looking for a laptop charger?

Anker 733 Power Bank (GaNPrime PowerCore 65W)\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You travel a lot and need power: We never take flight without the Anker 733 in our carry on luggage. It replaces multiple wall chargers and gives us a large battery on the go.\n\u2705 You carry a small laptop and a phone: The Anker 733 is powerful enough to charge a laptop and a phone together. Or you can charge your phone, headphones, and smartwatch all at once.\n\u274c You want a more portable option: Because of its combo nature, the Anker 733 is a bit bulky and cumbersome, but if you use it both ways, it's worth the trade-off in size to have such a useful device.\n\u274c You only want to charge a phone: If you don't need to charge a laptop occasionally, or you only carry a phone with no accessories, the Anker 733 is more than you need.\nThe Anker 733 is a revelation, and though it isn't the most powerful or feature packed power bank on this list, it was the best overall power bank we carried when we needed to charge multiple devices, no matter what those devices might be.\nIn our tests, it charged an iPhone 15 at full 20W speed, and it power a Chromebook and small laptops like a Macbook Air whether it's plugged into a wall or not.\nSpeaking of that wall plug, it's the most useful feature ever on a power bank. Some power banks come with a built in USB-C cord, but this Anker comes with a two-prong power outlet plug. That makes it a wall charger as well as a power bank, and the utility can't be understated.\nYou might think that adding a 65W wall charger to a power bank would add a lot of bulk. Well, you're right, the Anker 733 is big, and it's power-to-weight ratio isn't as high as the heavy hitters on this list. On the other hand, we charged the battery and three devices in the wall, then simply removed the Anker 733 and kept charging those devices with the built-in battery.\nThe Anker 733 has a 10,000 mAh battery inside, which is just shy of enough power to charge our iPhone 15 to 100% twice. It charged our big Galaxy S23 Ultra to 100% once, then lifted the battery to around 30% again.\nThere are two USB-C ports on the Anker 733, and both are capable of 65W charging when the power bank is plugged in to a wall outlet, or 30W when the battery is running the show. There's also a USB-A port for legacy devices. You can charge the Anker 733 by plugging it into the wall or you can plug in one of the USB-C ports to charge the battery.\nThe best magnetic power bank\n2. Anker MagGo Power Bank (10K)\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a premium MagSafe power bank: The Anker MagGo power bank looks and feels ultra premium. The display shows battery life as a percentage, which is obviously useful, and time remaining, so you know how much juice is left.\n\u2705 You want a durable power bank: The Anker MagGo power bank feels sturdy and solid, with a strong magnet capable of holding onto an iPhone tightly. The flip stand even felt secure.\n\u274c You want a lighted battery: This isn\u2019t a very light or thin power bank, so it may bulge in your pocket if you try to charge on the go.\n\u274c You have an Android: Unless your Android phone lines up perfectly with Apple's MagSafe magnets, skip this one and get a battery pack without magnets instead.\nThe Anker MagGo Power Bank (10K) is a versatile charging solution with a 10,000mAh capacity, capable of delivering 27W of wired power and 15W wirelessly. Its key feature is MagSafe compatibility, allowing it to magnetically attach to iPhones from the iPhone 12 series onwards for secure and efficient charging.\nThe strong magnetic hold supports both vertical and horizontal mounting, and despite the unpadded wireless zone, it didn't scratch my phone or power bank during my review period.\nAdding to its functionality, the MagGo Power Bank incorporates a foldable stand, providing a stable platform for propping up your iPhone during charging or content viewing. This thoughtful design element enhances its usability beyond basic charging.\nIn our tests, the Anker MagGo Power Bank charged an iPhone 13 Pro from 50% to 100% in approximately two hours, suggesting a full charge in roughly four hours. This process depleted the power bank to 73%, so we figure it can deliver multiple phone charges.\nA smart display provides useful information, showing the power bank's battery level and estimated remaining running time or charging time. However, this estimation tends to fluctuate, making it somewhat unreliable.\nThe MagGo Power Bank boasts a sleek and understated design with a robust build and premium materials, contributing to its overall durability. While it may be somewhat thick and heavy, its reliable charging performance and convenient smart readout make it a suitable travel companion. However, its size might make it less ideal for carrying in a pocket with an iPhone attached.\nThe best power bank for phones and more\n3. Iniu PD 22.5w 20000mAh\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a big battery for less money: While some power banks offer slightly higher capacity, they often come with a significantly higher price tag for a marginal gain in charging power. This option strikes an excellent balance between cost and capacity.\n\u2705 You want to charge a phone plus accessories: Equipped with USB-C and dual USB-A ports, the Iniu PD power bank provides simultaneous charging for multiple devices like phones, earbuds, and much more.\n\u274c You want to charge as fast as possible: Despite its 20000mAh capacity, the Iniu PD power bank has a maximum output of 22.5W. This charging speed falls short of the capabilities of many modern Android phones.\n\u274c You want a more compact battery: Weighing 12.8oz (363g), the Iniu PD 22.5w 20000mAh power bank is quite hefty. While pocketable, its weight might make it cumbersome for everyday carry. Consider lighter alternatives if portability is a priority.\nWith a big 20,000mAh Lithium Polymer battery, this power bank delivered multiple charges for all our devices. In our real-world testing, charging an iPhone 12 Pro to 100% once daily for three days depleted the power bank to only 54%, and we think this equals a week's worth of charge for typical usage.\nThe power bank supports 22.5W charging, which is fine for iPhones but falls short of the faster charging speeds supported by today's best Android phones (the OnePlus Nord 4 can charge up to 100W). It's also not powerful enough to charge a MacBook.\nEquipped with a USB-C port and two standard USB ports, the Iniu PD 22.5w 20000mAh allows simultaneous charging of up to three devices. This multi-device charging capability makes it versatile for users who carry multiple gadgets.\nWe really liked its sleek design. An LCD screen clearly displays the remaining charge, providing precise monitoring of power levels.\nThis power bank is relatively bulky and heavy. It lacks IP weatherproofing, so keep it dry. However, it's still pocketable and proved durable enough to withstand a music festival, including a day of heavy rain.\nThe Iniu PD 22.5w 20000mAh power bank excels in providing ample power at an affordable price. While it may not offer the fastest charging speeds or advanced features like wireless charging, its substantial capacity and multi-device charging capabilities make it a good option for users who want to keep multiple devices charged.\nThe best power bank value\n4. Iniu B61 10000mAh\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You just got a new iPhone and want the perfect accessory: What better way to celebrate having a USB-C port than buying a new power bank that uses it well.\n\u2705 You want a power bank that fits in a small pocket: The Anker Nano is the smallest power bank on our list, but it packs a big wallop for its small size, and that fold-down USB-C plug makes it easier to carry.\n\u274c You need to charge back up to 100%: The Anker Nano carries a respectable 5,000 mAh of battery life, but the power lost in charging means it can't get an iPhone 15 or Galaxy S23 back to full power in a single charge.\n\u274c You want to charge old stuff: We're not bothered by the lack of USB-A ports on this small charger, but if your watch or headphones requires it, every other charger on this list has on (including the water bottle charger).\nEverybody on our gift list who got a new iPhone is going to get an Anker Nano Power Bank (22.5W) this year. This cute little charger is perfectly sized to sit beneath your favorite smartphone, plugged into the USB-C port with a little plug that opens out or hides away for a sleek look.\nThe Anker Nano is only 5,000mAh, but that doesn't mean it can fully charge a 5,000mAh phone battery like you'll find in the Galaxy S23 Ultra. Power banks are about 60-70% efficient, depending on the phone's technology, so in our tests this power bank could charge an iPhone 15 to nearly full, but that big Ultra only got about 65% charge.\nThat's just fine, because this power bank was the perfect pocket companion to keep us going through a busy day. If you need more power, you'll have to carry a bag to hold a big battery, but the Anker Nano gave us enough power for busy digital living, without added bulk.\nIn fact, this is the most efficient battery on our list, in terms of power-to-weight ratios. At only 100g, the Anker Nano is the smallest, but it still packs in plenty of power for that weight. You could buy six Nano power banks and have more power for less weight than buying the big Anker Prime.\nThe Anker Nano used to be available in an Apple Lightning version, but those days are thankfully behind us. No matter what phone you are using, especially if you're enjoying the new iPhone 15, this is the power bank you should keep on you.\nBefore you buy, why not check out the latest Anker promo codes?\nThe best power bank for laptops\n5. Anker Laptop Power Bank\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You have multiple large devices\nAll of the Anker Laptop Power Bank's three USB-C outputs can charge up to 100W, which is plenty of power for most modern laptops and tablets.\n\u2705 You forget that essential cord\nWith two integrated USB-C cables, one of which doubles as a carrying handle, this power bank offers handy cords if you often forget your own.\n\u274c You need something lighter\nWeighing more than a pound (more than half a kilo), the Anker Laptop Power Bank isn't light. You won't be able to stuff this one into a pocket, for sure.\n\u274c You don't need a lot of power\nThat 165W output and 25,000mAh capacity will be overkill if you only need to charge your phone and your earbuds, not a laptop.\nThe Anker Laptop Power Bank is a robust solution for charging high-powered devices on the move, offering a substantial 165W output and a 25,000mAh capacity. While it's made for heavy-duty use, it maintains a relatively slim profile, though its weight and thickness are considerable.\nOur reviewer loved the integrated display, which provides real-time readouts of temperature and wattage for each of the four outputs, a feature not usually found on competing power banks.\nThe power bank includes one USB-C and one USB-A port on its side, along with two innovative built-in cables. One cable forms a loop that doubles as a carrying handle, while the other is retractable and magnetically secures to the base. Both cables are thick and durable, with robust support, effectively minimizing cable clutter and eliminating the need to carry separate cables.\nPerformance-wise, the Anker Laptop Power Bank delivered impressive charging speeds in our testing. All three USB-C outputs support up to 100W, and the device charged my M3 MacBook Pro and iPhone 16 to 50% in approximately 30 minutes. Real-time wattage tracking is displayed during charging.\nIn my lab tests, a full recharge of the power bank itself took just 90 minutes. It can also charge four devices simultaneously, with a maximum output of 130W, and includes a trickle charging mode for low-power devices.\nPriced at $99 / \u00a389, the Anker Laptop Power Bank offers excellent value for its power, versatility, and convenience. For users who frequently travel with large devices and require reliable portable power, this power bank is a solid and dependable companion.\nThe best magnetic stand power bank\n6. Ugreen Uno Magnetic Wireless Power Bank 10000mAh 15W\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want fast-charging\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking that Ugreen simply made a novelty, cutesy MagSafe power bank, but I'm delighted to say they've created a charger that's as fast as it is cute.\n\u2705 You want something whimsical\nIt's not for everyone, but if you appreciate adorable and eccentric things, like me, these emoji battery symbols will make you smile.\n\u274c You want something super compact\nIf you want a super slim option that's barely noticeable while attached to your iPhone, look for something thinner than this one.\n\u274c You need total reliability\nMy sample didn't always charge my phone after I'd attached it to the MagSafe pad. We'll keep testing in case reliablity is a long-term issue for this brand.\nThe Ugreen Uno Magnetic Wireless Power Bank 10000mAh 15W distinguishes itself with its whimsical, emoji-based display, though its aesthetic may not appeal to everyone. If you want a MagSafe power bank with a touch of personality, this device is a compelling option. It helps that we've seen frequent discounts from its official list price of $69.99 / \u00a364.99.\nIn terms of size and weight, the Ugreen Uno strikes a balance, neither overly bulky nor compact. The device features a combination of soft-touch silicone for the MagSafe charging surface and metallic plastic for the casing. An integrated metal stand provides support for the power bank so you can use your phone in Standby mode while it's charging.\nThe power bank\u2019s most distinctive feature is its smart display, which uses emoji faces to indicate battery levels. These animated expressions can easily be disabled if you're not in the mood.\nCharging performance was impressive, and the Ugreen Uno fully charged my iPhone 13 Pro in under two hours, making it one of the fastest MagSafe power banks we've tested. The combination of rapid charging and the unique emoji display makes the Ugreen Uno a worthy contender if you're looking for effective wireless charging that also happens to be cute.\nThe best power user power bank\n7. Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (250W)\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the absolute best power bank: It has an app to monitor charging details, enough power to drive a MacBook or two, and fast recharging using both USB-C ports. Truly an unmatched power bank.\n\u2705 You need power for days and days: You could leave with your iPhone 15 on a Monday and use only this battery until you return on Friday. It has enough juice for days of charging, not hours.\n\u274c You don't need all those extras: The Anker Prime power bank is pricey, and if you don't care about monitoring charge Wattage or days of battery life, find another option.\n\u274c You want a compact battery: The Anker Prime power bank has a very high power-to-weight ratio (PWR), but it's still the heaviest battery on this list. It's more than three times the weight of our bargain pick.\nThe Anker Prime series of Power Banks, including the Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (250W) and the Anker Prime 20,000mAh Power Bank (200W), are for people who truly love to geek out on power banks. If you came looking for the absolute best power bank you can buy, this is the best we've tried.\nFirst, let's start with the raw power. The big Anker Prime powered our MacBook Pro and other big testing laptops: it's USB-C ports are capable of 140W of power individually, and the entire battery pack can crank out 250W divided between the two USB-C and one USB-A port.\nYou can also charge the Anker Prime using both USB-C ports at the same time, for a combined recharging rate up to 170W. That means you can completely refill this whopping 27K mAh battery in under 40 minutes. I thankfully had an Anker 737 GaN Prime charger that was up to the task, and it's fun to see the percentage climb.\nThink this is an amazing power bank? We're just getting started. The Anker Prime power bank has a built-in display, and it's no cheap LCD, it's a sharp OLED that gives you detailed information about the power going out or coming into the power bank. If that's not enough, there's also an Anker app you can download that gives you even more information about the battery on your smartphone.\nThat app is essential because there's a Find My feature built into the battery. It doesn't work like an AirTag over UWB, it's only Bluetooth, but it's useful if you misplace your battery in your office (or you have multiple batteries, like I do).\nIn terms of charging, this massive power bank can charge an iPhone 15 more than five times. It can charge a big Galaxy S23 Ultra's 5,000mAh battery three-and-a-half times. Best of all, it charges at the fastest speed available on most of your favorite phones (excluding Oppo/OnePlus's unusual SUPERVOOC battery).\nIs the Anker Prime worth the high price? That's hard to say, since the larger battery has suffered from some availability issues, though the smaller version packs most of the same features, including the same maximum 140W charging speed in each USB-C port. If you want the best and you love to know about the power your devices are drawing, the Anker Prime Power Bank is the one to buy.\nThe best mini power bank\n8. Anker Nano Power Bank (22.5W)\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You just got a new iPhone and want the perfect accessory: What better way to celebrate having a USB-C port than buying a new power bank that uses it well.\n\u2705 You want a power bank that fits in a small pocket: The Anker Nano is the smallest power bank on our list, but it packs a big wallop for its small size, and that fold-down USB-C plug makes it easier to carry.\n\u274c You need to charge back up to 100%: The Anker Nano carries a respectable 5,000 mAh of battery life, but the power lost in charging means it can't get an iPhone 15 or Galaxy S23 back to full power in a single charge.\n\u274c You want to charge old stuff: We're not bothered by the lack of USB-A ports on this small charger, but if your watch or headphones requires it, every other charger on this list has on (including the water bottle charger).\nEverybody on our gift list who got a new iPhone is going to get an Anker Nano Power Bank (22.5W) this year. This cute little charger is perfectly sized to sit beneath your favorite smartphone, plugged into the USB-C port with a little plug that opens out or hides away for a sleek look.\nThe Anker Nano is only 5,000mAh, but that doesn't mean it can fully charge a 5,000mAh phone battery like you'll find in the Galaxy S23 Ultra. Power banks are about 60-70% efficient, depending on the phone's technology, so this power bank is good for charging an iPhone 15 to nearly full, but that big Ultra will only get about 65% charge.\nThat's just fine, because this power bank is the perfect pocket companion to keep you going through a busy day. If you need more power, you'll have to carry a bag to hold a big battery, but the Anker Nano gives you enough power for busy digital living, without added bulk.\nIn fact, this is the most efficient battery on our list, in terms of power-to-weight ratios. At only 100g, the Anker Nano is the smallest, but it still packs in plenty of power for that weight. You could buy six Nano power banks and have more power for less weight than buying the big Anker Prime.\nThe Anker Nano used to be available in an Apple Lightning version, but those days are thankfully behind us. No matter what phone you are using, especially if you're enjoying the new iPhone 15, this is the power bank you should keep on you.\nBefore you buy, why not check out the latest Anker promo codes?\nThe best cheap MagSafe power bank\n9. Baseus Magnetic Foldable Power Bank 20W 10000mAh\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a powerful magnetic charger: The Baseus Magnetic Foldable Power Bank is a high-capacity battery built onto a very strong magnet. It holds onto an iPhone tightly, even in landscape mode.\n\u2705 You want a portable StandBy dock: If you have an iPhone 12 or newer running iOS 17, you can use the Baseus Magnetic Foldable as a dock for your iPhone in StandBy mode, giving you a cool desk clock with notifications or a digital photo frame.\n\u274c You don't have a magnetic phone: You don't need an iPhone to enjoy the magnetic charging, but you'll need a case that lines up your phone with Apple's MagSafe wireless configuration, or else your phone won't charge properly.\n\u274c You need to charge quickly: The Baseus Magnetic Foldable Power Bank is a strong magnet and a big battery, but it charges very slowly, whether wired or wireless. If you don't mind your iPhone wearing a backpack, that's not a problem.\nThere are plenty of wireless power bank options on the market, but the Baseus Magnetic Foldable Power Bank impressed me with its incredibly strong magnet. I have the official Apple MagSafe battery pack, and it's magnetic attraction is much weaker than this Baseus power bank. While the Apple battery fell off my phone occasionally, the Baseus Magnetic power bank held tight with less worry.\nThat means I could twist my phone sideways into landscape mode and use the Baseus power bank as a portable stand for Apple's new StandBy mode, which is one of my favorite features on iOS 17, and certainly the one I use the most often.\nThe Baseus Magnetic power bank can't charge very quickly; the company says it can only charge an iPhone at 7.5W, which is half the wattage a MagSafe iPhone is capable of handling. That was not problem, because this is a power bank that can stick to your phone for a while, so speed won't be of the essence.\nFor the price and performance, the slower charging speed is a fine trade off. The Baseus Magnetic Foldable power bank had the second highest power-to-weight ratio on our list, and Baseus chargers are potent and affordable, a good mix.\nIf you have more than just your smartphone to charge, the Baseus Magnetic power bank has a USB-C port as well, and it can charge up to 20W, which is faster than the magnetic charging, if you really need a speed boost.\nWith 10,000 mAh inside, it can charge an iPhone 15 to 100% just short of twice. A Galaxy S23 Ultra will get back to 100% charge once with an extra 35% or so on top of that.\nThe best bargain power bank\n10. Baseus Airpow Power Bank 20W 10000mAh\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need more power for less money: The Baseus Airpow power bank starts at $20 in the US and is on sale often, so it's a real steal.\n\u2705 You need more than one USB port: Most batteries with this many USB ports cost much more, so having two USB-C and one USB-A port will help you charge everything you carry.\n\u274c You're trying to keep it simple: The Baseus Airpow doesn't have any built in wires or wireless charging, so you'll need to carry extras when it's time to power up.\n\u274c You want to charge fast: While the 20W charging is respectable and can keep up with the new iPhone 15 USB-C port, most Android phones can charge faster than that, so a faster battery pack would help.\nIf you haven't heard of Baseus, the company makes a healthy lineup of affordable, well-designed battery packs that don't feel nearly as cheap as their prices would indicate. The most affordable of the bunch, the so-called Airpow Power Bank, starts at $20 in the US but is available on sale often.\nWith three USB ports, including a USB-C port capable of 20W charging and a USB-A port for legacy devices, this battery is surprisingly feature-packed for such an inexpensive power bank.\nThe Airpow is not a small power bank, but Baseus makes efficient gear that doesn't take up too much space. It's power-to-weight ratio is on par with the best battery packs from Anker and others. At 245g (more than half a pound), it's bulky, and you'll need to carry extra wires, but it's sleek and nice looking enough to keep in a hand bag.\nWith 10,000mAh of power inside, the Baseus Airpow can charge an iPhone 15 once to 100% then once again to nearly full. It can charge a Galaxy S23 Ultra to full once, then add another quarter of a charge.\nIt's not the fastest battery, but that's expected for this price range. While a flagship phone like the Galaxy S23 Ultra can accept a charging speed up to 45W, the Baseus Airpow can only hit 20W maximum. That's enough for the iPhone 15, though the iPhone 15 Pro has an unpublished charging speed in excess of 20W.\nIf you need more, Baseus has plenty of options available in a range of capacity sizes with a variety of features. The options aren't quite as fast or polished as the best power banks from Anker, but the prices are better, and Baseus doesn't add more bulk for less bucks.\nThe best Apple Watch power bank\n11. Otterbox 2-in-1 Power Bank with Apple Watch Charger\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You worry more about your Apple Watch battery: Big iPhones have a big battery, but your watch might not last the day. You don't need a big phone battery when this cute 2-in-1 charger makes a great option instead.\n\u2705 You want your watch to be a desk clock: The Apple Watch has a charging made that makes it a small clock, and this battery turns your watch into a timekeeper that won't get in the way while you're typing, while also keeping your battery full.\n\u274c You have a watch that isn't from Apple: The Otterbox 2-in-1 Power Bank only attaches magnetically to the Apple Watch. Other smartwatches, like the Pixel Watch, won't work with this one, not at all.\n\u274c You need power for your phone: The 3,000mAh battery inside is plenty to keep your Apple Watch going, but that isn't enough power to get you even halfway charged on an iPhone 15, and even less on bigger phones.\nThe Otterbox 2-in-1 Power Bank with Apple Watch is a unique solution to a common problem. Our phones lasts longer than ever before, but wearable batteries haven't quite caught up to the all-day promise. With this cute little power bank, we didn't need to carry the special Apple Watch charging cable or a larger battery. This little doodad does the trick.\nThe front of the battery is a magnet, and it can hold the Apple Watch standing up. The Apple Watch offers a standby screen with a clock when it's charging, making this power bank effectively a small desk clock, which can be a useful tool if you need to keep time but hate wearing a watch while you type.\nUnfortunately, that magnet isn't quite strong enough for the fanciest Apple Watch bands I own. I have a gorgeous titanium Apple Watch band sent from Nomad, and it was too heavy to hang onto the Otterbox Power Bank's magnet, even though its titanium is incredibly lightweight compared to other metal bands. That's not a big surprise, there are a few chargers this larger band won't fit.\nFrankly, the power-to-weight ratio for this little power bank isn't very impressive, it's heavy for the slim 3,000mAh power that it offers. Instead of efficiency, you get to leave your extra-long, super-annoying Apple Watch cable at home and instead just pop your watch onto this cute little thing. It's a worthwhile trade, at least if Watch power is your biggest concern.\nThere isn't quite enough power in the Otterbox 2-in-1 power bank to recharge a phone fully, but you're welcome to try. Besides the Apple Watch magnet, it also has a USB-C port that can charge up to 15W, so you can feed some headphones or get a few more hours of screen time in a pinch.\nThe best combo power bank\n12. Tylt Bottle 2\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You were already planning on carrying both: A lot of people carry a water bottle every day, and often bring a power bank along for extra charging. Why not carry both in one device?\n\u2705 You work or study from a library or cafe: The Tylt Bottle 2 is really the perfect device for students in a library or working from a cafe. Rest your phone on the wireless puck and let it charge while you work, without fussy wires and outlets.\n\u274c You need a lot of power: Thankfully, the battery on the Tylt Bottle 2 isn't so big it adds too much weight, but that also means it isn't powerful enough for multiple charges.\n\u274c You need fast power: This is a very slow charger, whether wired or wireless, so it's better for casual charging while you sip your water and read a book.\nThere are plenty of combination power bank and some other device, but the Tylt Bottle 2 actually makes sense because we're usually carrying an insulated water bottle anyway, so we might as well screw a battery onto the bottom. With a 5,700mAh capacity, the Tylt Bottle 2 is just enough to get us through a very busy day, or keep the phone powered while we play games at the cafe.\nThe bottle is actually a nice, insulated affair, and it kept ice in cold water for 12 hours, which is all that we need. It has a good, strong strap to carry the bottle, though we would have liked a lid that was easier for sipping.\nYou can buy the Tylt Bottle with just a power bank attached, but our review sample from AT&T had the full wireless charging treatment. It's easy to set up a phone to charge while studying, working out, or working away from home: all places we take a water bottle and need a full phone battery.\nTylt could have just added a wireless charging feature and called it a day, but the Tylt Bottle 2 has a few surprises on board. First of all, in addition to wireless charging, you still get both a USB-C and USB-A port for charging just about anything you have.\nTylt also wisely left enough of a gap between the battery and the bottle that you can coil a small USB-C cord (included) into that space. That way, even if you're not charging wirelessly, you're not adding a lot of extra bulk to your bag. It's a smart setup.\nAdmittedly, making a battery that also fills up with water is a quick way to make a heavy battery, so we won't knock Tylt for being a heavy power bank. If you were already carrying both, the Tylt Bottle 2 power bank insulated water bottle combo is a fun, smart way to keep your kit charged.\nThis bottle isn't available on Amazon, but you can find it elsewhere, including directly from AT&T as one of the accessories they offer when you buy a phone. Maybe that means we'll see it offered in a bundle deal sometime soon.\nHow to choose the best power bank for you\nHow much power does a power bank really give me?\nOur testing shows that a power bank can offer your phone about 70% of the power it contains. It loses the rest due to the inefficiency of the power transfer. That means a 5,000 mAh battery can fully charge a phone with a 3,500 mAh battery, like an iPhone 16. If you have a phone with a large 5,000 mAh battery inside, you'll need a power bank that holds at least 7,200 mAh of power to charge your phone fully.\nHow fast can a power bank charge my phone?\nIf you want to get the fastest charging speed from a power bank, you need to make sure that it is charging at the same wattage as your phone's USB-C power port. Most phone makers publish their charging speed. Samsung phones charge at 45W. Apple iPhones usually charge around 25W. A Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 can charge up to 68W. If you buy a battery that can charge at the same wattage, you will be able to charge your phone in the fastest possible time.\nWhat's the difference between cheap power banks and name brands?\nWhen it comes to power and electricity, we don't mess around. We want a brand that is well-known and accountable for its products. Cheap batteries can start fires. We only list brands that we know and trust, and we have connected with each of these companies to make sure we know the people behind them. Then we test the products thoroughly in our labs to make sure they stand up to our durability testing and the manufacturer's performance claims.\nAre certain power bank brands more reliable than others?\nYes, the brands that we have included are the most reliable brands you will find, and you can buy any of the products these companies make knowing that we have tested them for reliability and durability. Some companies, like Anker, have more advanced charging technology thanks to years of research and development, but all of the brands we recommend make reliable products.\nHow do I choose the best power bank for me?\nIf you are charging a small smartphone, a simple power bank will suffice. If you plan on charging a laptop occasionally as well, or many devices at once, you'll want a power bank with more power and more features.\nIf you have a newer Android phone, or the latest iPhone models, you'll want a power bank with faster charging speeds to get your battery full faster.\nYou can also find a power bank that charges your phone (or even your Apple Watch) wirelessly. These will usually charge slower, but they can be very convenient if you want to leave wires at home.\nWhich power bank is the best quality?\nAnker makes the best power banks we have tested so far, but batteries from Baseus and Otterbox also performed well. All of the power banks on this list passed our testing, traveling with us on the road and powering our devices at home.\nAnker is the best in part because it packs more power into its batteries at a lower weight. Its batteries charge faster than competitors. Its small Anker Nano battery has the best power-to-weight ratio of any battery on our list.\nWhich brand is best for power banks in 2025?\nAnker is making some the best power banks right. It offers the best power-to-weight ratio, the fastest charging, and the most useful features. We have also been impressed by power banks from Iniu, which have done very well in our hands-on tests.\nHow many times can my power bank charge my phone?\nA 10,000mAh battery will give your phone around 6,000mAh of extra battery charge. That means a 10,000mAh battery can charge that phone twice ... almost. You may not get to 100% the second charge, but you'll be in the 90% range.\nAny power bank that is 5,000mAh or smaller will probably not guarantee 100% charge on an iPhone 16 or larger phone. If you have a big battery phone like the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which packs 5,000mAh inside, you'll need a power bank closer to 8,000mAh or more if you want a full recharge.\nHow we test the best power banks\nWe have tested the best power banks by using them to charge a variety of devices, including Apple iPhone, Google Pixel, and Samsung Galaxy phones. We have also charged Apple iPad tablets, and small laptops including a Pixelbook Go and a Surface Laptop Go.\nWe used the best power banks extensively while traveling to see how well they fit in our luggage and their relative utility versus the weight add to our pack.\nUsing the Anker Prime power bank, we were also able to test the charging speed claims of other power banks, as the Anker Prime will report charging speed in wattage.\n- Looking for a laptop charger?

      "text": "Google Pixel 10 vs Pixel 10 Pro vs Pixel 10 Pro XL \u2013 here\u2019s what's different\nWith the Pixel 10 series, Google has, in some ways, brought the standard model closer to the level of the Pros than we\u2019ve ever seen before. But in other ways, there are still quite a lot of differences between the Google Pixel 10 and its Pro-level siblings, and even between the Pixel 10 Pro and the Pixel 10 Pro XL.\nBelow, you\u2019ll find a rundown of the key ways in which these phones differ from one another. The focus here is on the differences, so if we haven\u2019t mentioned something, it\u2019s likely that it\u2019s the same or similar across all three devices.\nOf course, arguably the biggest difference you\u2019ll have to consider is the price, but once you get to grips with the other ways in which these handsets differ, you\u2019ll be better equipped to decide which Pixel 10 to buy.\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro XL has the biggest screen\nIf you think bigger is better, then the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is obviously the best choice of these three phones, as at 6.8 inches, its screen is far bigger than the 6.3-inch Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro.\nIt\u2019s also the highest resolution of the three at 1344 x 2992, though at 486 pixels per inch (ppi), it actually has a slightly lower pixel density than the 495ppi Pixel 10 Pro. The 422ppi Pixel 10 is the least sharp, though the difference is small enough to hardly matter.\nThe Google Pixel 10 also loses out on the brightness front, topping out at 3,000 nits compared to 3,300 nits on the Pro models. And it's a similar story for refresh rate, as while all three phones can reach 120Hz, the Pixel 10 can only drop as low as 60Hz, while the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL can get all the way down to 1Hz \u2013 which is great for conserving battery when a high refresh rate isn\u2019t needed.\nThe Pixel 10 loses out for RAM and storage\nThe standard Google Pixel 10 doesn\u2019t have as much RAM as its siblings, at 12GB rather than 16GB.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIt also comes with less storage at the top end \u2013 you can choose between 128GB and 256GB models, while the Google Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL top out at 1TB.\nHowever, while less RAM might impact the Pixel 10\u2019s performance a bit, it does at least still have the same Tensor G5 chipset as the other models.\nYou\u2019ll get better cameras with a Pro\nAll three of these phones have a triple-lens camera on the back, but the best specs are reserved for the Pro models.\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL each have a 50MP f/1.68 wide camera, a 48MP f/1.7 ultra-wide, and a 48MP f/2.8 telephoto camera (with 5x optical zoom) on the back, along with a 42MP f/2.2 front-facing camera.\nThe standard Google Pixel 10 instead has a 48MP f/1.7 wide camera, a 13MP f/2.2 ultra-wide, a 10.8MP f/3.1 telephoto (with 5x optical zoom), and a 10.5MP f/2.2 front-facing camera. So, you\u2019re getting quite a lot more megapixels with the Pro models.\nThe Google Pixel 10 is the lightest\nWhile the standard Pixel 10 has weaker camera and RAM specs than its Pro siblings, it does at least weigh less as a result, coming in at 204g. Admittedly, that figure only makes it negligibly lighter than the 207g Pixel 10 Pro, but it's quite a lot lighter than the 232g Pixel 10 Pro XL.\nAnd while the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro have identical dimensions, the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is, of course, quite a lot larger.\nThe main other differences in their design and builds relate to the colors, with the Pixel 10 coming in Indigo, Frost, Lemongrass, and Obsidian shades, all with a satin finish, while the Google Pixel 10 Pro and the Pixel 10 Pro XL are available in Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain, and Obsidian shades, all with a matte finish.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro XL charges fastest\nThese three phones each have a different battery capacity, with the Google Pixel 10 having a 4,970mAh battery, the Pixel 10 Pro having a 4,870mAh one, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL having a 5,200mAh one. But despite that, Google claims they\u2019ll all last for upwards of 30 hours, or for up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver mode.\nSo, there might not be much to separate them here (though we\u2019ll let you know in our full reviews), but the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL should still have an advantage, as it charges faster. Google claims you can juice this device up to 70% in around 30 minutes using a 45W charger, while the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro only support charging power of up to 30W, and can reach 55% in around 30 minutes of charging.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro XL also has an advantage with wireless charging, supporting charging power of up to 25W, while the other two models top out at 15W.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe impressive ZMI No.20 is one of the best power banks money can buy. It\u2019s not the cheapest, but uses premium components, has a large 25,000 mAh (90 Wh) capacity and is able to fast charge anything from a phone to a laptop at up to 100W.\nPros\n- +\nDual 100W outputs\n- +\nUses high-quality Samsung cells\n- +\nBig 25,000 mAh (90.75 Wh) capacity\nCons\n- -\nScratches easily\n- -\nSimple capacity only display\n- -\nBulky\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nZMI No.20 power bank review\nPower banks that claim to fast-charge laptops often fall short, but the ZMI No.20 delivers 100W output in a premium package. ZMI might not be a name you've heard of, but the brand is a key part of Mi (Xiaomi) and is well-known for making excellent, high-quality products. The No.20 is no exception, with a large 25,000 mAh (90 Wh) capacity, high-end components, and impressive multi-device charging capabilities. It\u2019s one of the best power banks available, though it can sometimes be difficult to purchase in Australia and the US, and almost impossible to find in the UK. Amazon is often the best place to buy it, but keep in mind that it doesn't go on sale frequently.\nI purchased this power bank personally and have used it for over two years. It remains my favourite laptop-ready power bank, thanks to its high performance, great form factor, and robust reliability.\nThe ZMI No.20 features two USB-C input/output ports and one USB-A port. The first USB-C port delivers up to 100W (20V, 5A), while the second is limited to 45W (20V, 2.25A) in or out. The USB-A port can also output 100W (20V, 5A) for PD-compatible devices like laptops, but only when using the included ZMI USB-A to USB-C cable. With a total power output of 210W across all ports, the No.20 has no issue fast charging multiple laptops, phones, or handheld gaming devices simultaneously. The 25,000 mAh capacity is also nearly the largest allowed while still being flight-safe.\nThis power bank also supports pass-through charging and functions as a UPS, ensuring uninterrupted power delivery when plugging or unplugging devices. It works well with low-power devices like routers (using a USB-C to 12V cable), making it a viable option for backup power needs. The remaining capacity is displayed via a simple but effective light-up percentage indicator that's easy to read in sunlight but slightly too bright at night.\nThe long but slim form factor makes it easy to fit in bags, including backpacks and laptop bags. At 580 grams, it\u2019s not the lightest option, but its weight is reasonable given its high capacity, and 18.8 cm length and 8.1 cm width allow it to slip into most storage pockets in bags. While providing robust protection if dropped, the shiny plastic finish is prone to scratches.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Samsung S25 Ultra deftly manages to meld the consistent Galaxy S series aesthetic with all that made previous Ultras notable, including the S Pen. But this phone is also distinctly different to all previous Ultras, thanks to deep and richly baked-in generative AI capabilities. It's a fantastic mix that will please the most ardent Android, Samsung, and Google Gemini fans.\nPros\n- +\nUnified design that doesn't skimp on Ultra appeal\n- +\nBiggest screen of the lineup\n- +\nPowerful AI\n- +\nExcellent battery life\nCons\n- -\nGenerative AI doesn't always deliver\n- -\nSamsung still shies away from total photo-reality\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Two-minute review\nIs there such a thing as 'ultimate phone design'? That was my first thought as I held the new Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and turned it over in my hand. Surely, it\u2019s lost a bit of identity as it shed the last vestiges of Galaxy Note design and adopted the more familiar and blockier look of its Galaxy S brethren. The Galaxy S25 Ultra looks not only more like all the other S25 phones in the lineup, but more like an iPhone than ever before.\nI don\u2019t consider this mimicry. Instead, as I noted above, there may in fact be an ultimate smartphone design \u2013 and for the Ultra line this shift was inevitable. A moment of sadness, though, for the once-iconic Galaxy Note that owned the 'flagship' designation in both looks and functionality \u2013 it was the only smartphone virtually industry-wide that included an integrated stylus. Somehow, Samsung has managed this slimmer, lighter, and squarer makeover without losing space for the S Pen, which alone is an achievement worth celebrating.\nWhen, however, people are done talking about the new design \u2013 including a slightly larger screen than the S24 Ultra \u2013 they\u2019ll likely become obsessed with the deeply integrated AI experience.\nWith the S25 line, Samsung has effectively blurred the lines between Galaxy AI, Bixby system-level AI actions, and Google\u2019s Gemini\u2019s generative AI capabilities. And Samsung isn\u2019t shy about presenting its partner's capabilities. They\u2019re accessible through a long press of the power button (or a press of the virtual home button), and while the connections between Gemini, Google\u2019s apps, and Samsung\u2019s apps isn\u2019t always seamless and automatic, when it works, it\u2019s smooth and quite useful.\nThere are promises in here of a deeper understanding of you by watching not just what you do on the phone but how Samsung-connected wearables like Galaxy Ring, Samsung Galaxy Watch, and SmartThings accessories gather data and understanding of your physical and smart home-based activities. Ultimately, that information is presented as part of Now Brief home screen widgets that give you, among other things, morning and evening briefs.\nThat tracking might sound scary if Samsung hadn\u2019t worked closely with silicon partner Qualcomm to ensure that the Snapdragon Gen 8 Elite for Galaxy has a silicon core that's devoted to your Personal Data Engine, and if it weren't for Samsung\u2019s liberal use of its Knox security both on the phone and across its ecosystem of devices.\nIn my time reviewing the S25 Ultra I saw some personal insights in my briefs, but not enough for them to be meaningful. I think this is the kind of feature that will bear fruit after weeks of using the phone and essentially training the AI to understand you.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAI can be found sprinkled throughout the system, including in photography, which is a good thing since Samsung has done little to upgrade the physical camera array. Of the five cameras (four on the back and one on the front) only one got an upgrade: the ultrawide, which is now a 50MP camera.\nOn the other hand, Samsung has upgraded its Pro Visual engine and, as a result, photography is generally even better than on the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. And if your photographic skills aren\u2019t up to snuff, you can now ask Gemini to suggest changes based on the quality of your own photos.\nThere are more powerful tools for generating AI images and making AI alterations to existing photographs. Sketch to Image is more powerful than ever, and I found that using the S Pen with Sketch to Image generated incredibly realistic AI additions.\nSamsung\u2019s AI integration also extends to sound. It can recognize music playing in a video or hummed by you, and it\u2019s also adept at cleaning up messy audio in videos you shoot.\nThis is a better-looking, faster, smarter, and longer-lasting Ultra than any that\u2019s come before it, and it still costs the same $1,299.99 / \u00a31,249 in the US and UK, and even slightly less in Australia at AU$2,149. That\u2019s a triumph right there. For existing Samsung Galaxy S Ultra fans, this is the ultimate Android.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review: Price and availability\n- Price holds firm, slight reduction in Australia\n- More screen for the same price\n- Deals could save you a bundle\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra was unveiled at Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event on January 22 and began shipping on February 7.\nIt's available in a choice of four colors wherever you buy: Titanium Silverblue, Titanium Whitesilver, Titanium Grey, and Titanium Black; and three more that are exclusive to the Samsung store: Titanium Jadegreen, Titanium Pinkgold, and Titanium Jetblack.\nThe phone ships in either 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB storage configurations, and every variant comes with 12GB RAM. Pricing is as follows:\n| Storage | US price | UK price | AU price |\n| 256GB | $1,299 | \u00a31,249 | AU$2,149 |\n| 512GB | $1,419 | \u00a31,349 | AU$2,349 |\n| 1TB | $1,659 | \u00a31,549 | AU$2,749 |\nSo, yes, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is a mightily expensive phone, but since most carriers (and indeed Samsung itself) offer regular promotions throughout the year, it's unlikely that you'll need to pay full price.\nFor the latest Galaxy S25 Ultra deals in your region, check out our dedicated Samsung Galaxy S25 deals page.\n- Value score: 4.5/5\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review: Specs\nHere's a look at the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's key specs:\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra |\n|---|---|\n| Dimensions | 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm |\n| Weight | 218g |\n| OS | One UI 7, based on Android 15 |\n| Display | 6.9-inch AMOLED, 120Hz |\n| Chipset | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy |\n| RAM | 12GB |\n| Storage | 256GB / 512GB / 1TB |\n| Battery | 5,000mAh |\n| Rear cameras | 200MP main, 50MP ultra-wide, 10MP telephoto, 50MP telephoto |\n| Front camera | 12MP |\n| Charging | 45W wired, 15W wireless |\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review: design\n- Looks more like the rest of the Galaxy S-series crew\n- Lighter and thinner\n- Still accommodates the S Pen and 5000mAh battery\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra drops the Galaxy Note-esque look completely, replacing it with a look that reflects the Galaxy S aesthetic found across the S25 line, although it\u2019s not an exact replica of those phones. Yes, it has a flat titanium band wrapping around the body, but the corners are slightly squarer than those of the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus.\nCompared to the S24 Ultra, this phone is, at 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm, slightly taller but also narrower, and thinner. It\u2019s also considerably lighter, at 218 grams compared to the S24 Ultra\u2019s 232 grams. That\u2019s a difference I noticed when I held the phone in my hand \u2013 and, yes, that\u2019s lighter than Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 Pro Max, which weighs in at 227 grams.\nI give Samsung credit here for making a lighter phone that somehow still has room for the 5,000mAh battery and to stow the S Pen.\nDespite the significant chassis alteration, there aren\u2019t a lot of other design changes. The volume rocker and power/sleep/Gemini button are in the same relative positions, while Samsung has shifted the antenna cutout from that side to the top of the opposite edge.\nOn the bottom is the same USB-C charging and data port, a wide slot for the base speaker (the other half of the loud and clear stereo speaker system is in a well-hidden channel at the top of the screen), the S Pen slot, and a SIM slot. That last slot is notable because while Apple\u2019s iPhone line in the US only offers eSIM support, the S25 Ultra offers standard SIM and eSIM, and includes Dual-SIM support.\nWhile the S25 Ultra's body is titanium (and rated IP68 for water and dust protection), the front and back are swaddled in Gorilla Glass Armor 2, which includes the extra protection of ceramic. However, while this material might protect the phone from drops, it\u2019s still not scratch-proof, and even though I\u2019ve taken extreme care with my review unit I\u2019m still noticing some long scratches on the display. They\u2019re not deep, and they're only noticeable when the screen is off; still, I await the day when a smartphone manufacturer can deliver a truly scratch-proof display.\nOverall, I like the new look and feel of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and I don\u2019t mind that it\u2019s lost a bit of its distinctive Note aesthetic. This is a big-screen handset that I enjoy holding and using.\n- Design score: 5/5\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Display\n- Biggest Galaxy Ultra screen yet\n- Responsive, bright and color-rich\n- ProScaler technology\n- No other display technology changes\nIf you\u2019ve just read through the design section and assumed that a lighter, thinner smartphone might feature a smaller screen, you should be pleasantly surprised. Samsung has managed to make the Galaxy S25 Ultra screen 6.9 inches (diagonally); that\u2019s 0.1 inches larger than the S24 Ultra's screen, and it's all thanks to a 15% smaller bezel surrounding the display.\nThis change to the screen size is almost the full extent of changes between the S24 Ultra and the S25 Ultra. It\u2019s still a Quad HD+ display that's capable of running at 3120 x 1440 pixels, which is higher-res than the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s 2868 x 1320 Super Retina XDR display. You won\u2019t see the S25\u2019s Quad HD+ resolution, though, unless you dig into settings and switch from the default FHD+ resolution (2340 x 1080) \u2013 and there\u2019s good reason to leave well enough alone, as the FHD+ resolution looks excellent in most situations, and you\u2019ll get better battery life by sticking with the lower resolution.\nThis is still an adaptive display, auto-switching from 1Hz to 120Hz on an as-needed basis. Again, you can save a bit of battery life by switching to 60Hz, but the butter-smooth motion is, in my opinion, worth the tradeoff.\nThere is one notable update that's not to the display itself, but the display is where you'll see it. ProScaler is an image upscaling technology adopted from Samsung's TV tech. The ability to upscale any lower-resolution content is powered by silicon, and might come in handy if, say, you're playing an old game or watching an old video on the Quad HD+ screen\nIt's a beautiful, perfectly flat screen, and unlike on the iPhone 16 Pro Max there\u2019s no large island cutout for cameras, sensors, and information. Instead, there\u2019s just a small circular cutout for the 12MP front-facing camera, and it's not something you notice while watching movies, playing games, browsing the web, or engaging with Gemini.\nUnderneath the screen is an ultrasonic fingerprint reader. I initially only registered my thumb, but found that the scanner sometimes struggled to read my print. My skin is incredibly dry right now, so that might have contributed to the flakiness; later I registered multiple digits, and found better luck with an index finger. I also used a PIN and my face to unlock the phone.\n- Display score: 5/5\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: S Pen\n- S Pen still included\n- Small but highly effective\n- No more BLE support\nThe integrated S Pen looks, feels, and essentially works the same as the S Pen in the S24 Ultra but with one notable difference: it no longer has Bluetooth Low Energy support. This means that some of the long-distance remote-control features no longer work \u2013 you can\u2019t use the button on the pen to, for instance, advance slides. Samsung told me they removed BLE support because so few people were using the related features, and I can say that I didn\u2019t miss it in my tests.\nIn general, I\u2019m a big fan of the S Pen. It's thin and small, but a worthy drawing implement. I used it in Notes, Sketchbook, and Sketch to Image, and it\u2019s also good for note taking \u2013 I was impressed by how effortlessly Samsung Notes could convert my scrawl to accurate text.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review: cameras\n- Lots of lens choices\n- Overall excellent photography capabilities\n- Samsung still favors over-saturated images\n- High megapixel counts result in exquisitely detailed imagery\nAt a glance, the Galaxy S25 Ultra camera array looks unchanged from the S24 Ultra's, but Samsung has given the array a visual upgrade. All the lenses now appear to almost float above the chassis. It\u2019s a neat effect, but for the most part it's a skin-deep alteration, and Samsung has left almost all the camera specs unchanged.\nHere\u2019s what you\u2019ll find on the S25 Ultra.\n- Main camera: 200MP\n- 5x telephoto: 50MP (also provides the 10x zoom through a sensor crop)\n- 3x optical: 10MP\n- Ultra-wide: 50MP\n- Front-facing camera: 12MP\nThe only new camera of the bunch is the 50MP ultra-wide. More pixels here mean better low-light performance for ultra-wide shots and more detailed macro shots, as evidenced in my tests. This is mostly because the camera defaults to binned shooting, which means it\u2019s combining roughly four pixels for each one in the final image. Similarly, you\u2019ll do most of your 200MP main-camera shooting in a pixel-binned 12MP mode.\nI shot a wide variety of photos with all the cameras, and broadly these are excellent lenses and sensors, able to capture a lot of detail and rich, vibrant colors. As is Samsung\u2019s way, though, many of the images are over-saturated; a blue sky is too blue, and green leaves are deeply green. Portrait shots default to some beautification.\nIf you like absolute truth in your photography, this might bother you. I didn\u2019t mind it, and I appreciated how some of the photos I took with the 200MP main camera had more detail in them than what I get with the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s 50MP main camera.\nI was especially impressed with the 50MP ultra-wide\u2019s nighttime performance. Colors and details in challenging situations looked especially good, and the detail in macro shots more or less matched what I can get with the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s macro mode.\nThe Samsung Galaxy 25 Ultra\u2019s zoom capabilities are strong even without a dedicated 10x optical zoom. It\u2019s been two Ultra generations since the Ultra line featured 10x optical zoom and I\u2019m officially over it. I find the 5x zoom backed by a 50MP sensor sufficient, and the 10x zoom based on a sensor crop more useful. These days I tend to avoid the 30x and 100x Space Zooms because I just don\u2019t know how much AI image guesswork they\u2019ll introduce.\nI was especially impressed with the job the 5x and 10x zoom did when photographing a busy woodpecker in a San Jose, California, park.\nIf I have one criticism of the Samsung Galaxy S 25 Ultra camera system it's that there is some faint color bleeding between objects. It\u2019s not in every image or widespread, but in one case I noticed that the green of a leaf was bleeding into the blue sky around it. I attribute this to the algorithmic Pro Visual engine, and I assume a tiny tweak could fix it.\nMost of Samsung\u2019s efforts to improve photography revolve around software, and some of them can be found in Export RAW, a standalone pro-photography app that now offers virtual aperture settings. You\u2019ll need to download Expert RAW and then enable the Lab features to try it.\nWith it, you can virtually adjust the aperture from f/1.4 to f /16. Lower aperture settings provide more of a bokeh effect, while higher f-stop values push the focus out past your subject so that the background is in focus as well.\nSince smartphone cameras don\u2019t have moveable apertures, this is a digital effect, and the quality of the bokeh might not be as dramatic or good as what you\u2019d get from a pro-level camera with a physical aperture. In my experience, I found the effect somewhat lacking; it just didn\u2019t appear to show the real range of a physical aperture.\n- Cameras score: 4.5/5\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: camera samples\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: software and AI\n- Samsung is full steam ahead with deep AI integration\n- It's blurring the lines between Galaxy AI, Google Gemini, and Bixby\n- Now Brief is a smart idea that starts with limited utility\n- The full power of the onboard AI may take time to reveal itself\nSamsung\u2019s long and enduring partnership with Google and Qualcomm pays off in a rich and virtually unmatched system-level AI experience.\nOne of the hallmarks of this system is that it\u2019s less about which AI is doing what than it is about execution and availability. You might be using Galaxy AI for one task, Google Gemini for a different prompt, and Bixby for a system-level query. The lines between these systems are blurred, as are those between apps built by Google, Samsung, and third-party companies.\nSamsung likes to talk about AI agents, though I wouldn\u2019t yet call this 'Agentic AI,' as most of the AI inside the S25 Ultra is not acting on your behalf without your intervention. But it doesn\u2019t take much to launch relatively complex queries beyond a long-press of the power button (Gemini button) and speaking to the phone.\nInteractions with Gemini and other AI can be as simple as pressing the button and asking a question about the weather, or as complex as \u201cfind me chilli recipes on YouTube and then collect them in a Note.\u201d The prompt results in Gemini perusing YouTube, finding the recipes, and then collecting them in a Samsung Note.\nThis cross-app prompt functionality works with a small collection of non-Google and non-Samsung apps, including Spotify and WhatsApp. I asked Gemini to find science-related podcasts on Spotify and then make a list of them in Notes. Unfortunately, Gemini collected a list of links, and when I asked Gemini to please give me a list of names, it could not comply.\nMy other complaint with these cross-app connections is that nothing works unless you link apps like Spotify to your Google account.\nMultimodal capabilities mean that the AI can react to everything from photos and videos to audio. Samsung, though, has some work to do on making these processes simple and seamless.\nWhen I wanted to get a calorie count from my burger, fries, and soda lunch, I started by holding down the Gemini button and then selecting the plus sign in the prompt field. Then I selected the camera, took a photo of my meal, and selected 'Attach'. Then I pressed the microphone button and asked Gemini about the calorie count. The result was a detailed report on the caloric intake for my lunch (it was over 1,200 calories \ud83e\udd26\u2642\ufe0f). Gemini is a bit of a chatterbox; its answers are often so long that I lose interest and hit stop, although to be fair, the useful information is always within the first two or three sentences.\nSimilarly, I took photos of some of the unfinished ingredients at the burger shop and asked Gemini what I could make with them. It smartly figured that I could use all this to make cheeseburgers. Sure, that was the obvious conclusion for me, a human being, but it is impressive that an AI can figure that out with little additional context.\nI also used the feature to identify various plants, and followed up with questions about how to care for each of them. In each case, Gemini maintained the context of our conversation.\nOne of the more exciting aspects of the S25 Ultra\u2019s AI capabilities is its potential to learn about you and offer helpful daily guidance. This shows up as the new Now Brief widget on the home screen. At a glance, this might appear like a simple, albeit personalized widget with some information about your day. But it\u2019s more than that, and may become more useful the more you use the phone, and the more Samsung devices you own.\nNow Brief is tied to the new Personal Data Engine, a local bit of learning AI that\u2019s housed in a special core on the Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 8 Elite chip. The S25 Ultra uses that processing space to gather and analyze useful, and of course, encrypted, data and insights about you and then present it in Morning, Midday, Evening, and Late Night briefs. These include basic info like calendars, weather, and reminders. But they can also give you insights such as your energy score and, if you wear a Samsung Galaxy Watch or Galaxy Ring to bed, your sleep quality. Eventually, it\u2019ll start offering suggestions on how you can improve these metrics.\nSamsung\u2019s mix of local encrypted data and occasional cloud-based AI (usually for the larger generative models Galaxy AI and Gemini sometimes need) mirrors what Apple is doing with Apple Intelligence; most of its AI is local, but it will sometimes send the data to its encrypted cloud or even, with your permission, pass it off to third parties like ChatGPT.\nSamsung\u2019s unfettered use of Gemini and easy blending of Bixby system features and third-party apps make Samsung\u2019s AI offering feel more complete and comprehensive.\nAnd while Apple is only comfortable letting people create cartoonish images of themselves and new genmojis. Samsung is pushing the boundaries of AI image generation. Since the introduction of Galaxy AI last summer, I\u2019ve been adding uncanny, lifelike AI elements to original photos using Sketch to Image, and the S25 series proves even more adept at fictional creations.\nI used Sketch to Image to add a white mouse to a series of images. Using the S Pen, I sketched a simple line drawing of a mouse, doing my best to accurately position it on each surface. Then I let Samsung Galaxy AI do its work (a network connection is necessary for this function, which means the generation is likely happening in the cloud). The results were jaw-dropping \u2013 the only way you\u2019d be able to know that the white mouse had not coincidentally appeared in each photo is the 'AI generated content' watermark on each image.\nDrawing Assist lets me sketch anything poorly and generate watercolors, cartoons, pop art, 3D cartoons, oil paintings, and sketches based on it. I can also generate images from text and original photos. The sketch features do a nice job of turning photos into line drawings. The system can be a bit unpredictable, though. I entered the prompt \u201cA bird flying over the Empire State Building\u201d and the S25 Ultra\u2019s Image Assist refused to generate an image because the \u201cprompt might contain inappropriate content.\u201d\nMore practically, Samsung's Galaxy AI was effective at helping me clean up images using Generative Edit. It was effective at removing a man who chose to step into frame just as I was trying to run some nightography tests.\nAI has helped Samsung add it own Shazam feature. If I\u2019m watching a video with a song in it, I can identify it by pressing the virtual home button and choosing the note icon. This worked every time when I tried it with YouTube and Instagram Reels, and it was also able to identify any song I tunefully hummed.\nA more useful audio feature, in my opinion, is the new Audio Eraser. This is very similar to Apple\u2019s Audio Mix tool. Both can identify, separate, and remove background noise in videos. Samsung\u2019s version did an excellent job of removing all noise from a video I shot on busy street. Yes, if you remove all background noise the final audio can sound a bit unnatural, but I\u2019m still impressed.\nAs a system, One UI 7 is cleaner and smarter than ever. Even Gallery has been given an AI upgrade, so it\u2019s better at returning useful photo results. I can now select the search icon and then speak my query, with typically accurate results. I asked for photos of plants, and the S25 Ultra instantly returned all my photos that included plants.\nI still prefer using Google Photos, which of course is preloaded on the system and can back up all your Galaxy S25 photos. If you let it do that, you\u2019ll find no better image search engine.\n- Software AI score: 4.5/5\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Performance\n- Fastest Ultra chip ever\n- Personal Data Engine for core-deep AI support\n- Super-efficient\nThroughout my tests, I marveled at the Samsung Galaxy S 25 Ultra\u2019s combination of power and efficiency. There was no task it couldn\u2019t handle, and I found its AI capabilities speedy and effective. Much of this is down to the new Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 8 Elite for Galaxy, which is backed by 12GM of RAM.\nThis isn\u2019t just the fastest chip Qualcomm\u2019s ever produced; it\u2019s a custom version for Samsung. Geekbench 6.3 benchmarks show that the Gen 8 Elite for Galaxy has significantly closed the gap between Galaxy phone performance and iPhones running the latest Apple Silicon (Apple\u2019s A18 Pro). In my anecdotal tests, Apple\u2019s still in the lead, but our Future Labs results put the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra just ahead of the iPhone 16 Pro Max on multi-core tests.\nGraphics scores are comparable to Apple\u2019s, and real-world performance on games, productivity, and general use tasks do not belie those numbers.\nPerhaps more notable is that despite intensive use I\u2019m seeing amazing battery life. Thanks is due in part to the Gen 8 Elite\u2019s 3-nanometer process and the new 40%-larger vapor chamber that manages heat. It\u2019s been paired with a new Thermal Interface material (TIM) which covers the CPU and is then covered by the vapor chamber.\nAs I mentioned above, this 5G phone supports dual SIM, and still gives you the option of using a physical SIM card. It also supports ultra-wideband (UWB), which could be useful for using the phone to locate those new Samsung SmartTags, and Wi-Fi 7, which should help future-proof your connectivity experience.\n- Performance score: 5/5\nSasmung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Battery\n- Days of battery life\n- Cool operation\nSamsung rates the Galaxy S25 Ultra at 31 hours of video playback, and on mixed tasks I got well over 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. With a 65W charger, I fully charged the 5000mAh battery in one hour.\nIn our Future Labs test, the rundown ran 18 hours and 35 minutes when using the phone screen at the standard 60Hz refresh rate, and dropped to 17 hours and 15 minutes when using the more resource-intensive adaptive refresh rate. To put this in perspective, the iPhone 16 Pro Max managed 17 hours and 35 minutes in the same tests.\nThe phone supports 5W Qi-based wireless charging, and will work with Qi2-based chargers, though I don't think it supports the latter's 15W, faster charge times.\n- Battery score: 5/5\n| Value | Samsung held fast on the Galaxy S25 Ultra price. it's not a cheap phone, but design updates, integrated AI and inclusion of the S Pen make it good value. | 4.5/5 |\n| Design | The Galaxy S25 Ultra is now fully part of the Galaxy S-series design family and that generally improves it. We have a bigger screen, thinner and lighter body, and we still have all the things that make an Ultra special, including the titanium, the S-Pen and a big-enough battery. | 4/5 |\n| Display | The biggest Ultra screen ever. It doesn't break any new ground on technology, but is still an excellent screen for all kinds of content and uses. | 5/5 |\n| Cameras | There are a lot of lenses here and they're backed by high-pixel counts that will result in extremely detailed photos. Samsung only updated one lens since the last Ultra, but choosing the ultra-wide was the right move, as it improves both ultra-wide and macro images. | 4.5 |\n| Software and AI | Samsung's and its partners' commitment to deep AI integration is laudable, and it makes for the most frictionless AI experience I've found on any smartphone. It's also backed by a solid and even more useful One UI update. And the AI experience will likely get richer over time | 4.5/5 |\n| Performance | The S25 Ultra's Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 8 Elite for Galaxy is one impressive chip. It's a near-perfect mix of performance and efficiency. | 5/5 |\n| Battery | Best battery life I've seen on a smartphone. Days of use is within reach. | 5/5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want the biggest-screen Galaxy without the bulk\nSamsung has pulled off a neat trick with the S25 Ultra update, extending the screen without making the phone any larger or heavier. It's also the same price as last year.\nYou own other Samsung products\nSamsung doesn't always get credit for having an ecosystem in the way Apple does, but it's putting real effort into making all of its products, from its smartphones to its smart tags to its refrigerators, work together. This phone is potentially an AI-powered hub for Samsung's AI ecosystem experience.\nYou want industry-leading battery life and top-notch performance\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra shows its prowess in benchmarks and real-world performance, and it does so while surprising us with the best battery life yet.\nDon't buy it if...\nAn integrated S Pen doesn't interest you\nGet the Galaxy S25 Plus, which nearly matches the S25 Ultra in screen size and only lacks the S Pen, the 5x optical zoom and the 50MP ultra-wide camera, and save yourself a decent chunk of cash.\nYou're not interested in AI\nIt's fair to call the Galaxy S25 Ultra an AI phone, and if AI isn't something you want or need, look elsewhere.\nGalaxy S25 Ultra review: Also consider\nApple iPhone 16 Pro Max\nApple's newest Pro Max is bigger and more powerful than ever. It has a beautiful screen, an excellent camera array, and the new Camera Control, which could change how you approach iPhone photography. It's probably the most direct competitor to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and a clear pick for Apple fans.\nRead our full Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max review\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a bold reimagining of Samsung\u2019s flagship foldable smartphone. If a 6.9-inch display isn't enough for you, and you want to stick with Samsung and get most of that AI goodness, this foldable is the obvious choice.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 review\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL\nThe Pixel 9 Pro XL is just a bigger Pixel 9 Pro, but that's good enough. It doesn't have exclusive camera features or extra RAM for a boost, it's just got a bigger display and a bigger battery. That means the Pixel 9 Pro is an even better pick this year, but it also means that you can choose your Pixel based on the size you like, not the features you need.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9 Pro XL review\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Galaxy S25 Ultra | iPhone 16 Pro Max | Galaxy Z Fold 6 | Pixel 9 Pro XL |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Price (at launch): | $1,299 / \u00a31,249AU / $2,149 | $1,199 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,149 | $1,899.99 / \u00a31,799 / AU$2,749 | $1,099 / \u00a31,099 / AU$1,849 |\n| Dimensions: | 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm | 163 x 77.6 x 8.25mm | 68.1 x 153.5 x 12.1mm (folded) 132.6 x 153.5 x 5.6mm (unfolded) | 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5mm |\n| Weight: | 218g | 227g | 239g | 221g |\n| Displays | 6.9-inch AMOLED, 120Hz | 6.9-inch OLED | 7.6-inch QXGA+ Dynamic AMOLED 2XInfinity Flex Display (2160 x 1856, 20.9:18), 374ppi120Hz adaptive refresh rate (1~120Hz)Cover: 6.3-inch HD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display(2376 x 968, 22.1:9), 410ppi120Hz adaptive refresh rate (1~120Hz) | 6.8-inch 1344 x 2992 1-120Hz 'Super Actua' LTPO OLED |\n| Cameras | 200MP main, 50MP ultra-wide, 10MP telephoto, 50MP telephoto | 48MP main (24mm, f/1.78), 48MP ultra-wide (13mm, f/2.2), 12MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom (120mm, f/2.8) | 50MP, f/1.8, 12MP, f/2.2, 10MP, f/2.4, 10MP, f/2.2, 4MP | 50MP, f/1.68, 82\u00b0 FoV, 1/1.31-inch sensor w/ OIS, 48MP, f/1.7, 123\u00ba FoV, 1/2.55-inch sensor, 'New' 5x 48MP, f/2.8, 22\u00b0 FoV, 1/2.55-inch sensor w/ OIS, 42MP, f/2.2, 103\u00ba FoV |\n| Chipset: | Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 8 Elite for Galaxy | Apple A18 Pro | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Mobile Platform for Galaxy | Google Tensor G4 |\nHow I tested the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\n- I tested the phone for one week\n- I took dozens of photos\n- I played games and watched movies\n- I checked email and worked in Slack\n- I used AI features extensively\n- Benchmark testing is for comparison, not scoring purposes\nI started testing the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra from the moment Samsung handed me my test unit in San Jose, CA.\nI've been using it as my everyday phone and for comparison with my iPhone 16 Pro Max.

  "argos_summary": "The Iniu P50\u2011E1 is a pocket\u2011sized 10,000\u202fmAh power bank that delivers up to 45\u202fW fast charging via PPS, achieving efficient conversion with about 13.5\u202f% loss. It can top up phones and laptops, but its 15\u202fV max output limits full speed on higher\u2011voltage devices. The unit is lightweight (160\u202fg), compact (83\u202f\u00d7\u202f52\u202f\u00d7\u202f26\u202fmm), and comes with a 3\u2011year warranty, making it a strong value proposition for everyday carry. Its price is around $33, and it offers above\u2011average performance compared to similar models such as the Anker 733 or Iniu B6.",
