      "title": "Morgan Wallen Won't Submit His No. 1 Album To The Grammys This Year",
      "summary": "Country star Morgan Wallen has decided not to submit his May‑released album \"I'm the Problem\"—which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and features duets with Tate McRae, Eric Church and Post Malone—for any category at the 68th Grammy Awards, a move reported by Billboard and Hits Daily Double.  The album received mixed critical reception, earning a three‑star rating from Rolling Stone, and Wallen has only twice been recognized by the Recording Academy, both for collaborations with Post Malone.  While the exact motive behind the boycott remains unclear, Wallen’s history of public controversies—including a SNL stage walk‑off, a racial‑slur incident, and a recent reckless‑endangerment plea—may have influenced his decision, echoing similar Grammy boycotts by artists like Drake and The Weeknd.  The Recording Academy has responded to past criticisms by diversifying its voting body, but Wallen’s camp has declined to comment on the current withdrawal.",
