  "description": "Nvidia and AMD agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of its revenue from the sale of a certain chips to China. Is that legal?",
  "content": "President Trump shakes hands with Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang during an April event on \u201cInvesting in America\u201d in Washington.\n\nPresident Trump struck an unusual deal with Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices that allows the companies to sell certain chips to China in exchange for giving the U.S. government a 15% cut of those sales.\n\nBut the unprecedented agreement also has raised concerns from politicians and legal experts over whether the deal is legal and would pose a national security threat.\n\nQuestions also linger about exactly how the deal, which was announced Monday, would work because the U.S. Constitution bars taxes on exports, although some experts said Trump could find a workaround.\n\nThe U.S. government might receive $3 billion from the revenue split if China\u2019s demand for Nvidia\u2019s H20 chip \u2014 which is less powerful than the company\u2019s highest-end artificial intelligence chip \u2014 reaches $20 billion, according to a note from Bernstein Research.\n\n\u201cIt ties the fate of this chip manufacturer in a very particular way to this administration that is quite rare,\u201d said Julia Powles, a professor and executive director of the UCLA Institute for Technology, Law & Policy.\n\nTrump\u2019s agreement with the world\u2019s most valuable company could put pressure on other tech companies and major exporters to strike similar deals with the U.S. government, but it\u2019s still unclear what the implications will be internationally, she said.\n\nThe deal is the latest example of how tech companies are seeking to curry favor with the Trump administration, which has threatened to impose tariffs on semiconductor companies that don\u2019t commit to investing in the United States.\n\nApple faced potential tariffs as well, but committed to investing $100 billion more in U.S. manufacturing after Trump criticized the company for expanding iPhone production in India.\n\nTrump also placed restrictions in April around the export of certain AI chips, including Nvidia\u2019s H20 and AMD\u2019s MI308, over national security concerns.\n\nHe\u2019s called for the resignation of Intel Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan, who has faced scrutiny over his reported investments in Chinese companies, but changed his tune after meeting the executive this week.\n\nDemocratic and Republican lawmakers have criticized the idea that tech companies should split their sales with the U.S. government in exchange for export licenses that allow them to resume chip sales in China.\n\n\u201cExport controls are a frontline defense in protecting our national security, and we should not set a precedent that incentivizes the Government to grant licenses to sell China technology that will enhance its AI capabilities,\u201d Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Mich.), the chair of the House Select Committee on China, said in a statement.\n\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, (D-Ill.), a ranking member of that committee, said in a statement that the deal raises questions about its legality and how the funds will be used.\n\n\u201cThe administration cannot simultaneously treat semiconductor exports as both a national security threat and a revenue opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cBy putting a price on our security concerns, we signal to China and our allies that American national security principles are negotiable for the right fee.\u201d\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t answer questions about the agreement. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday that \u201cthe legality of it, the mechanics of it, is still being ironed out by the Department of Commerce.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Trump defended the deal with Nvidia, stating that the H20 chips are \u201cobsolete\u201d and less powerful than the company\u2019s more high-end Blackwell chip. At a news conference, Trump said he met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and initially asked for a 20% revenue split but they came down to 15%.\n\n\u201cWe negotiate a little deal,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo he\u2019s selling a essentially old chip.\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks came after a report from the Financial Times over the weekend that Nvidia and AMD would pay 15% of their China chip revenue to the U.S. government. AMD didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement that the company hasn\u2019t shipped H20 chips to China for months but it hopes that easing export restrictions will \u201clet America compete in China and worldwide.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership. America\u2019s AI tech stack can be the world\u2019s standard if we race.\u201d\n\nFor Nvidia, the stakes are high. Huang said in a May interview with Stratechery, a newsletter and podcast, that the Chinese market is about $50 billion a year. Restricting H20 chip sales means that the company is walking away from profits that could be used to compete with China in the race to dominate AI.\n\nTaylar Rajic, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said she\u2019s skeptical that legal concerns would halt the arrangement because it\u2019s unclear who would sue.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t identify who would bring that suit forward,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be Nvidia because they\u2019re the ones who negotiated this deal.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese officials have their own fears that Nvidia\u2019s chips could have location tracking or remote shutdown capabilities, though the company has denied those accusations.\n\n\u201cChina obviously has its own concerns and its own national security considerations that it wants to take into account,\u201d Rajic said. \u201cIt just depends on whether or not they want to buy it from us too.\u201d",

      "text": "Nvidia is the first $4-trillion company. Here are three things to know\n- Share via\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Nvidia is already the world\u2019s most valuable company, being one of the biggest beneficiaries of the global artificial intelligence boom.\nThis week, the Santa Clara-based chip maker got another windfall.\nThe Jensen Huang-led technology giant on Monday received approval from the U.S. government to sell some of its AI chips in China, boosting Nvidia\u2019s stock price by 4% to $170.70 a share on Tuesday. Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has received similar assurances from the government.\nNvidia\u2019s valuation has risen dramatically over the last two years since generative artificial intelligence became a mainstream topic. Last week, the 32-year-old company became the first publicly traded firm to reach $4 trillion in market capitalization, beating tech titans Microsoft and Apple.\nThough it\u2019s a largely symbolic moment, the milestone raised the stakes for competition in the AI space, which has attracted enormous amounts of capital from established tech players and start-up investors.\n\u201cOnce you reach that level of market cap, everybody and their brother wants to be you,\u201d said Rob Enderle, principal analyst with advisory services firm Enderle Group. \u201cSo that means that there\u2019s going to be a huge focus on creating competitive technologies to Nvidia because it looks incredibly lucrative.\u201d\nNvidia has become a primary force in the growth of AI technology, as many applications are built with Nvidia\u2019s chips.\nPrior to the AI boom, Nvidia was mostly known for creating premium graphics cards that were attractive to gamers in rendering high-speed visuals. More recently, the company has become known for selling powerful chips that help chatbots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and self-driving cars process information quickly enough to make the technology useful. Nvidia said in its 2025 annual report that it powers more than 75% of the supercomputers on the TOP500 list, which ranks the 500 most powerful computer systems in the world.\nSanta Clara chipmaker Nvidia has ridden the AI revolution to briefly vault over Microsoft and Apple and become the world\u2019s most valuable company.\nWhat is powering Nvidia\u2019s rise?\nFounded in 1993, Nvidia has ridden many technology waves, including the crypto frenzy.\nBut lately, Nvidia has seen tremendous growth thanks to worldwide investor interest \u2014 and competition for dominance \u2014 in artificial intelligence.\nCompanies are eager to explore how AI can make processes more efficient and figure out complex problems. But getting the computing power behind AI can be expensive if companies are building hardware on their own. That\u2019s where Nvidia comes in.\nNvidia\u2019s sales increased 69% to $44.1 billion in its fiscal first quarter compared to a year ago. Net income was nearly $18.8 billion, up 26% from a year ago. In its fiscal year 2025, the company\u2019s revenue more than doubled to about $130.5 billion compared to a year earlier, and net income increased 145% to nearly $72.9 billion compared to fiscal year 2024.\nIn the last 12 months, Nvidia\u2019s shares have increased more than 30%. Since five years ago, the stock has risen more than sixteenfold.\n\u201cIt is clear AI is going to change the world and people want to get on that train, and Nvidia is the easiest entry point,\u201d wrote Berna Barshay, a partner at online investment platform Wall Street Beats, in an email. Over time, new winners and formidable rivals may emerge, Barshay said. \u201cBut during this foundational period of infrastructure creation, Nvidia has certainly been king.\u201d\nOther companies were slower to innovate in AI, including Apple and Intel, and underestimated how quickly AI technology would advance, analysts said.\nVenture capital investors and private equity firms poured $3.1 billion to fund 144 deals in the L.A. area in the first quarter of this year, up 15% from a year ago.\nWho is Jensen Huang?\nHuang, a former microprocessor designer, discussed the idea behind Nvidia inside a Denny\u2019s in San Jose with fellow entrepreneurs Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. The company\u2019s name is partly based on the Latin word \u201cinvidia\u201d \u2014 which means envy, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nMany businesses are certainly jealous of Nvidia\u2019s success now, but in the 1990s, the company almost went out of business when its first chip, NV1, failed, according to media reports. Huang has said in public comments, including commencement speeches, that adversity can help people become better leaders.\nBorn in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1963, the onetime Denny\u2019s dishwasher has become one of the industry\u2019s most recognizable names, on par with Apple chief Tim Cook and Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg. Thousands of people watch Huang\u2019s keynote at Nvidia\u2019s developer conference, as his vision could provide a road map for companies eager to expand investments in AI. Some analysts regularly refer to him as the \u201cgodfather of AI.\u201d\nResearchers and startup founders are rushing to develop and deploy drones, sensors and satellite imagery analysis that they believe could have reduced the amount of damage from the Los Angeles fires.\nWhat challenges lie ahead?\nThe biggest challenges facing Nvidia are trade wars and competition, analysts say.\nTariffs in the semiconductor industry could hurt companies such as Nvidia that manufacture and sell countless chips abroad. The company said in its annual report that 53% of its revenue in its 2025 fiscal year came from outside the United States.\nThe company said that geopolitical tensions and conflicts in China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan, where the manufacturing of its product components and final assembly are concentrated, could disrupt its operations, product demand and profitability.\nNvidia has worked with its production partners to increase U.S. manufacturing of its chips.\nSeveral years ago, the U.S. restricted Nvidia\u2019s sales of its chips in China due to concerns that its AI technology could be used to help the Chinese military. Huang has said that since the U.S. government could choose to apply restrictions, he didn\u2019t think policymakers needed to be concerned about that and warned that allowing Nvidia to lose market share in China would cede a major advantage to Chinese tech company Huawei, according to Bloomberg.\nWhile many analysts say Nvidia has a significant lead on competitors, it is possible over time they could catch up. OpenAI, which uses Nvidia products for ChatGPT, is developing its own chip design, according to Reuters.\nThere\u2019s also the question of whether the power grid is robust enough to support the infrastructure needs of the fast-growing technology, which could slow down not just Nvidia but the larger AI ecosystem.\nSan Francisco\u2019s vacancy rate is expected to decline later this year thanks to OpenAI and other AI startups that are leasing more space in the city.\nDespite the challenges, Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, is bullish on Nvidia, saying it is possible that the company could reach $5 trillion in market cap during the next 18 months.\n\u201cThe world\u2019s still catching up and the thing is, it\u2019s going to take years for them to catch up,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re looking at the AI revolution as a multidecade transformation, it\u2019s going to be really hard to take Nvidia out of that position.\u201d"

      "text": "Trump extends China truce for 90 Days, averting tariff hike\n- Share via\nPresident Trump extended a pause of sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days into early November, stabilizing trade ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\nTrump signed an order extending the truce, according to a person familiar with the matter. The pact, which saw the U.S. and China agree to reduce tit-for-tat tariff hikes and ease export restrictions on rare-earth magnets and certain technologies, was due to expire Tuesday.\nThe text of the order wasn\u2019t immediately available and it was unclear whether it included any other changes to U.S. trade policy or to the terms of the arrangement.\nNegotiators from both sides reached a preliminary agreement to keep the deal last month in Sweden, and the president\u2019s advisors had expressed optimism that he would approve it \u2014 but Trump has made last-minute demands and changes in prior trade matters. Had the truce not been extended, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would have jumped to at least 54% starting after midnight in New York.\nThe White House declined multiple requests for comment. Trump, speaking to reporters earlier Monday, demurred when asked whether he would extend the deal. CNBC reported earlier on the signing.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump said when asked whether he would extend the deadline. \u201cWe\u2019ve been dealing very nicely with China.\u201d\nThe extension will ease worries of a renewed tariff war that threatens to choke off trade between the U.S. and China. An escalation between Washington and Beijing earlier this year shook global financial markets.\nIt also will give the countries more time to discuss other unresolved issues such as duties tied to fentanyl trafficking that Trump has levied on Beijing, American concerns about Chinese purchases of sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil and disagreements around U.S. business operations in China.\nThe signing may clear the path for Trump to visit China to meet with President Xi Jinping in late October, around the time of an international meeting in South Korea that the U.S. leader is likely to attend.\nTrump earlier this year ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese goods, and Beijing responded in kind. U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports ultimately reached 145%, and China curbed access to magnets crucial to U.S. manufacturers. The two sides reached a 90-day truce in May, under which the U.S. lowered its China duties to 30% while Beijing reduced levies on U.S. goods to 10% and agreed to resume rare-earth exports.\nTrump\u2019s willingness to parlay with China has prompted concerns from national security hawks that he\u2019s unwilling to crack down on the his nation\u2019s biggest geopolitical rival. Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reached deals with the Trump administration to secure export licenses by agreeing to pay 15% of their revenues from certain Chinese artificial intelligence chip sales to the U.S. government.\nTrump earlier Monday also signaled openness to separately allowing Nvidia to sell a scaled-back version of its most advanced AI chip to China, saying that \u201cit\u2019s possible I\u2019d make a deal.\u201d\nWith the deadline nearing, Trump on Sunday had called on Beijing to quadruple purchases of American soybeans, something he said would help reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China.\nTrump\u2019s decision to extend the truce follows two days of discussions in Stockholm in July led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng \u2014 the third round of talks between the Washington and Beijing in less than three months.\nAlthough Chinese officials and the Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper had signaled satisfaction with the Stockholm talks, and U.S. Cabinet secretaries predicted an extension, the pact remained fragile. Bessent had said that any decision to extend the deal would be up to Trump.\nRare Earths\nAt issue in the ongoing dialogue is how the two countries will seek to maintain a stable trading relationship while applying barriers such as tariffs and export controls to limit each other\u2019s progress in crucial sectors including battery technology, defense and semiconductors.\nBoth sides have been taking steps to turn down the temperature and reduce flashpoints recently, with Chinese exports of rare-earth magnets starting to recover in June and the U.S. saying it would approve shipments of a semiconductor used for AI that it had blocked.\nU.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who participated in the Stockholm negotiations, has sounded an optimistic note on discussions with China over rare-earth flows, saying that the U.S. had secured commitments about their supply.\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on making sure that magnets from China to the United States and the adjacent supply chain can flow as freely as it did before the control,\u201d Greer recently told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in aninterview. \u201cAnd I would say we\u2019re about halfway there.\u201d\nFlows of rare-earth magnets from China to the U.S. rose to 353 tons in June, up from just 46 tons in May, according to the latest customs data. Total shipments were still substantially lower than before Beijing launched export controls in early April.\nSales of advanced AI chips remain an issue, despite Trump\u2019s decision to relax export controls. Chinese authorities in late July summoned Nvidia to discuss alleged security vulnerabilities related to its H20 chips.\nTariff Push\nChina-U.S. negotiations have been on a separate track from other talks that the Trump administration has held with trading partners as it moves to implement sweeping so-called reciprocal tariffs and industry-specific levies on other economies.\nTrump\u2019s 30% duties are composed of a 20% levy tied to fentanyl and a 10% baseline charge. That\u2019s on top of existing tariffs on certain Chinese products from his first term.\nLeonard, Wingrove and Dlouhy write for Bloomberg."

      "text": "Trump says Intel CEO is \u2018highly conflicted,\u2019 calls for his resignation\n- Share via\nChipmaker Intel is the latest tech company facing political pressure from President Trump.\nOn Thursday, Trump called for the immediate resignation of Intel Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan, who took the helm in March to turn around the beleaguered company.\nThe Silicon Valley tech giant, which has a new leader, has lagged behind its rivals during the AI boom and is slashing costs.\n\u201cThe CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!\u201d Trump wrote on his social media platform.\nTrump didn\u2019t say what the conflicts were in his post, but his remarks came after Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) sent a letter to Intel\u2019s board, expressing national security concerns about Tan\u2019s reported ties to Chinese companies. Cotton cited a report from Reuters that said Tan has invested in more than 600 Chinese firms and some of them have links to the country\u2019s military.\nTrump\u2019s call for Tan\u2019s resignation adds to a list of issues Intel already has to deal with.\nThe 57-year-old tech company, once the most valuable U.S. chipmaker, is trying to keep up as the race to dominate artificial intelligence escalates. The Santa Clara, Calif., company has been losing money and has seen its stock price plunge while it falls behind rivals such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\nIntel\u2019s share price closed at $19.77 on Thursday, down 3%.\nThe company said in a statement that its board and Tan are \u201cdeeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests and are making significant investments aligned with the President\u2019s America First agenda.\u201d\nTrump said Wednesday during an event in which Apple announced an additional $100-billion investment in the United States that he plans to place a tariff on semiconductors, but that there won\u2019t be a charge for companies building in the U.S.\nPresident Trump has criticized Apple for manufacturing iPhones outside of the United States.\nAlthough he praised companies such as Apple and Nvidia, he criticized Intel.\n\u201cIntel was just taken over the coals. They were taken to the cleaners, frankly, and moved to other places, in particular Taiwan,\u201d Trump said at the event.\nIntel, known for making the \u201cbrains\u201d that power computers, has been investing heavily in its foundry business, taking on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips for companies including Apple and Nvidia. During the Biden administration, the Department of Commerce awarded Intel roughly $8 billion to support manufacturing and advanced packaging projects in the U.S."

      "text": "Listen to this post:\nGood morning,\nThis week\u2019s Stratechery Interview is running early this week, as I had the chance to speak in person with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at the conclusion of his Computex 2025 keynote, which occurred this morning in Taiwan. I do plan on touching on some of the topics in this interview later this week, so, in the spirit of sharing my conversations with you \u2014 which undergirds this interview series \u2014 I wanted to post this as soon as possible.\nI have spoken to Huang three times previously, in March 2022, September 2022, and March 2023. What was notable about those interviews was the extent to which Huang was trying to make the world understand the potential of GPU computing; now that the potential is being realized, Huang and Nvidia are facing an entirely new set of problems, even as they continue to push computing forward.\nThis interview starts out discussing some of those new challenges that are related to politics in particular: we discuss last week\u2019s deals with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the ban on H20 sales to China, and why the U.S. approach to chip controls risks America\u2019s \u2014 and Nvidia\u2019s \u2014 long term control. Huang also makes the case for why AI will drive GDP growth in the near future, and maybe even reduce the trade deficit.\nAfter that we get into today\u2019s keynote and Huang\u2019s keynote last month at GTC. As I note in this interview, I was surprised at how different they were, perhaps because they had different audiences: Taiwan OEMs and component makers and their enterprise customers today, versus American hyperscalers last month; the key thing to understand about Nvidia is that they want to sell to both. To that end, we discuss why a full-stack Nvidia solution maximizes utility, including how Dynamo improves inference performance, even as Nvidia\u2019s approach to software and systems-building lets them sell you only the parts you want. And \u2014 perhaps appropriately given the question \u2014 we briefly touch on gaming at the end.\nAs a reminder, all Stratechery content, including interviews, is available as a podcast; click the link at the top of this email to add Stratechery to your podcast player.\nOn to the Interview:\nAn Interview with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang About Chip Controls, AI Factories, and Enterprise Pragmatism\nThis interview is lightly edited for clarity.\nTopics:\nArab AI and the Chip Diffusion Rule | Nvidia and China | AI GDP Growth | Dynamo and Full-Stack Nvidia | Enterprise AI and Pragmatism | Whither GamingArab AI and the Chip Diffusion Rule\nJensen Huang, welcome back to Stratechery\nJensen Huang: Great to see you, Ben.\nIt is great to actually meet you in person, our previous talks have been over Zoom, and you\u2019re here in Taiwan. You just announced a new building that\u2019s pretty close to my house, so that\u2019s exciting. When we talked before, I felt like you wanted the world to understand what GPUs could be. It was a pre-ChatGPT when we first started talking and now the world\u2019s entire market rests on a knife\u2019s edge when you announce earnings. Now, I think we\u2019re in a quiet period, I\u2019m not asking about earnings, but how does it feel to be thrust in that position, the center of the world in that regard?\nJH: Well, you asked me a question that I now have no interesting answer. The answer is I have no feelings about it, but I do do recognize this, that while we\u2019re in the process of reinventing Nvidia, which it is always really central to what we\u2019re doing at the office, we\u2019re trying to reinvent Nvidia so that we could be ahead of the puck so that we could be where the industry will go and we want to solve problems that are hard and contribute to the industry. But very importantly now, not only have we created a computing platform, we reinvented our company, we\u2019re much more of a data center scale company, and we offer technology that is for the very first time wholly integrated to work together, but disintegrated so that the whole ecosystem could work with it.\nBut the thing that I said at the keynote, which is really important is that for the very first time that we\u2019re building computers, not just for the technology industry, we\u2019re building computers for a new industry called AI. Now, AI is partly technology, but it\u2019s also partly labor and it augments labor as we know, and as we go into robotics it\u2019ll be very, very clear. This new technology called AI actually is a new industry wholly, and this whole industry is going to be powered by factories, which is going to need a lot of computers, and people are just coming to terms with the fact that we are about to go into a future where we\u2019re computing, what people call data centers, but they\u2019re really AI factories, is likely to be quite large.\nI noticed you referenced Satya Nadella on the Microsoft earnings call reported the number of tokens that they processed, I think that was last quarter. Was that your favorite bit of earnings from this quarter? I latched onto it right away too, what a great metric.\nJH: In fact, the number of tokens that are actually being generated is way, way, way higher than that. That\u2019s just the part that Microsoft was generating for third parties, but their own consumption is much, much higher and doesn\u2019t include OpenAI either, so you could just imagine how much it is.\nFrom what I understand, that is a very, very large amount relative to the number that was reported. You\u2019ve been on quite the world tour \u2014 you and I know Taiwan is beautiful, I mentioned the new office park \u2014 I do have to ask what\u2019s the Middle East like at this time of the year?\nJH: Hot, but not humid.\nIt\u2019s a dry heat, right?\nJH: Yeah, it\u2019s dry heat. I sort of really enjoyed it because the buildings were cold and I would walk out and just bask in the sun and I actually felt really great. But the nights are just incredible. The nights are incredible. Eating outside, having a cup of tea outside, it\u2019s real incredible.\nI\u2019m also of course asking about these AI deals that have been announced with Saudi Arabia and UAE. Why from your perspective is that important and why was it important for you to be there?\nJH: Well, because they asked me to be there, and we were there to announce two quite ambitious AI infrastructure build outs, one in Saudi Arabia and one in Abu Dhabi, and the leaders of both countries were very out in front recognizing the importance of their nations participating in the AI revolution, recognizing that they have an extraordinary opportunity, they have an abundance of energy and a shortage of labor, and the potential of their countries are limited by the amount of labor that they have, the amount of people that they have. So for the first time, they could transform, if you will, from energy to digital labor and robotics labor, agents, robots. They\u2019re super focused on that and very articulate about it.\nHis Royal Highness in Saudi Arabia was very articulate about it and very passionate about and understand the technology even. And Sheik Tahnoun in Abu Dhabi, very passionate about it, very forward thinking about it, understands very deeply the implications of the technology and the opportunities for them and so I was delighted to be there, we\u2019re partnering with both of them.\nWe helped launch a new company called HUMAIN in Saudi Arabia and their hope is to be on the world stage building these AI factories, hosting international companies, companies like OpenAI who was also there, and so a very big initiative.\nThis is a big shift. Part and parcel of this is a step back from the AI diffusion rules, which I think was pretty harsh on those countries in particular, having a regulated number, has to be controlled by US companies, gated in some respects by what\u2019s built in the US. Nvidia, I think contrary to your previous actions, had come out very strongly against those and from your perspective \u2014 there\u2019s a bit where you\u2019ve had to grow up, I feel like. Tae Kim said in his book that Nvidia is like an F1 car built around you, and you\u2019re the driver and is there a bit where you never wanted to think about this government stuff, and so Nvidia never really thought about this government stuff, and then suddenly you\u2019re the most important company of the world and you had to learn about this very, very quickly?\nJH: Well, it wasn\u2019t that I never wanted to, I never had to. For the vast majority of Nvidia\u2019s life we\u2019ve been dealing with building the technology, building the company, building the industry, competing.\nYeah, in an industry that\u2019s pure competition.\nJH: Every single day, every single moment. Building our supply chain, building our ecosystem. Notice I just described a bunch of things that are gigantic in scale and scope, plenty hard in itself, and all of a sudden the diffusion rule came out, and I think we said it at the time, but I think it\u2019s become apparent to everybody now, it is exactly wrong, it\u2019s exactly wrong for America. If the goal of the diffusion rule is to ensure that America has to lead, the diffusion rule as it was written will exactly cause us to lose our lead.\nAI is not just the layer of software called a model, AI is a full stack thing, that\u2019s the reason why everybody\u2019s always talking about Nvidia systems and infrastructure and factories and so on and so forth. AI is full stack. If America wants to lead in AI, it has to start by leading full stack at the chip level, at the factory level, infrastructure level, at the model level as well as the application level \u2014 AI is all of that.\nYou can\u2019t just say, \u201cLet\u2019s go write a diffusion rule, protect one layer at the expense of everything else\u201d, it\u2019s nonsensical. The idea that we would limit American AI technology right at the time when international competitors have caught up, and we pretty much predicted it.\nAnd by international competitors, you mean other models?\nJH: China\u2019s doing fantastic, 50% of the world\u2019s AI researchers are Chinese and you\u2019re not going to hold them back, you\u2019re not going to stop them from advancing AI. Let\u2019s face it, DeepSeek is deeply excellent work. To give them anything short of that is a lack of confidence so deep that I just can\u2019t even tolerate it.\nDid we spur that work to be even better by virtue of the restrictions that were placed on them, particularly in terms of memory management and bandwidth?\nJH: Everybody loves competition. Companies need competition to inspire themselves, nations need that, and there\u2019s no question we spur them. However, I fully expected China to be there every step of the way. Huawei is a formidable company, they\u2019re a world-class technology company. The researchers, the AI scientists in China, they\u2019re world-class. These are not Chinese AI researchers, they\u2019re world-class AI researchers. You walk up and down the aisles of Anthropic or OpenAI or DeepMind, there\u2019s a whole bunch of AI researchers there, and they\u2019re from China. Of course it\u2019s sensible, and they\u2019re extraordinary and so the fact that they do extraordinary work is not surprising to me.\nThe idea of AI diffusion limiting other countries access American technology is a mission expressed exactly wrong, it should be about accelerating the adoption of American technology everywhere before it\u2019s too late. If the goal is for America to lead, then AI diffusion did exactly the opposite of that.\nI think AI diffusion also misses the big idea about how the AI stack works. The AI stack works like a computing platform, it\u2019s a platform. The larger, the more capable your platform, the larger the install base, more developers run and develop on it. When more developers develop on it, it makes the results, the applications, that run on your computing platform better. As a result, you sell more, and more of your computing platform is adopted, which increases your install base, which increases developers using it to develop AI models, which increases \u2014 that positive feedback system can\u2019t be understated for any computing platform, it\u2019s the reason why Nvidia is successful today.\nThe idea that we would have America not compete in the Chinese market, where 50% of the developers are, makes absolutely no sense from a computing infrastructure, computing architectural perspective. We ought to go and give American companies the opportunity to compete in China, offset the trade deficit, generate tax income for the American people, build, hire jobs, create more jobs.\nNvidia and China\nIs it fair to say we\u2019re halfway there? Because we started out with the Gulf deal and the AI diffusion rule and certainly, I think you can see from a nation-state competition perspective, having these countries\u2014\nJH: These two ideas go hand in hand and what I mean by that is this: if we don\u2019t compete in China, and we allow the Chinese ecosystem to build a rich ecosystem because we\u2019re not there to compete for it, and new platforms are developed and they\u2019re not American at a time when the world is diffusing AI technology, their leadership and their technology will diffuse all around the world.\nThat\u2019s my point, where from your perspective, we\u2019re halfway there. At least we\u2019re not cutting us off in other countries.\nJH: That\u2019s right.\nBut we should go all the way and let Nvidia back in China.\nJH: Yeah, but I would argue that, in fact, not going into China is about 90% of the way there. It\u2019s actually not 50/50, it\u2019s 90%.\nSo we got 10% done.\nJH: Yeah, that\u2019s right. Exactly.\nFor the record, I agree with you. My view is this attempt to limit chip cells and then give them all the chip-making equipment they want is precisely backwards \u2014 it\u2019s a lot harder to track chips than it is chip-making equipment anyway. One of the theories that people in Washington DC have put forward is, \u201cThe chip-making companies or the semiconductor equipment manufacturing companies, they\u2019ve been in Washington for years, they\u2019re very good at lobbying and Nvidia\u2019s not here, and so they\u2019re behind the eight ball\u201d. Does that ring true to you? Do you just say have a hard time having people in Washington understand this point of view?\nJH: We had to work really hard in the last several years to build a presence in DC. We have a handful of people, most companies our size have hundreds of people, we have a handful. Our handful of people are amazing, they\u2019re telling our story. They\u2019re helping people explain, understand not just how chips work, but how ecosystems work, and how AI ecosystems work, and what are some of the unintended consequences of the policies.\nWe want America to win. Every company should want their country to win, and every country should want their companies to win, those are not terrible things to feel, those are good things to feel, and it is also good that people love to win. Competition is a good thing, aspiring to be great is a good thing. When some country aspires to be great, we shouldn\u2019t begrudge them. When some company aspires to be great, I don\u2019t begrudge them. It causes us to all rise above and do even better than we could, and so I love watching people who aspire to be great.\nThere\u2019s no question China aspires to be great, good for them! They should expect absolutely nothing less, and for all of the AI researchers and AI scientists that I know around the world, they got to where they are because they all aspire to be great, and they are great. I think the idea that somehow that\u2014\nTo win, you have to put the other one down.\nJH: That\u2019s right, it makes no sense to me. We ought to go faster. The reason why Nvidia is here today, the reason why we have our position today, we had absolutely zero support from anybody to get here, just let us keep running hard. I think the idea that we would hold other people back, as you mentioned, it just spurs them to be even greater, because these are amazing people.\nI agree. I find it, as an American, deeply frustrating. I feel we should want to win by out-innovating, by going faster and this idea we\u2019re going to win by pulling up the ladder and cutting people off, and putting bureaucratic red tape on everyone and trying to track everything just seems deeply, frustratingly un-American to me.\nJH: Yeah. Anyhow, I think the President really sees it, he wants America to win.\nWell here\u2019s a question on this, because this is the same administration that cut off the H20, a chip that you basically designed to the previous administration\u2019s specs, and suddenly, \u201cIt\u2019s not okay\u201d, and now they\u2019re doing this deal. The critics are there, \u201cOh, this is going to open it up to China, potentially, XYZ\u201d. It does feel like a shift in administration, maybe they\u2019d argue it\u2019s still the same thing. But we\u2019ve also had a lot of shifts between the US and China over the last six weeks, I think is one way to put it.\nDo you get a sense that maybe there\u2019s been a real realization that this world is so interconnected and related, and what goes on one side happens on the other, and maybe it\u2019s not going to be so easy to peel apart, and there\u2019s going to be a return of pragmatism, and how do we manage this? Are you optimistic in that regard or are you preparing for the worst?\nJH: The President has a vision of what he wants to achieve, I support the President, I believe in the President, and I think that he\u2019ll create a great outcome for America, and he\u2019ll do it with respect and with an attitude of wanting to compete, but also looking for opportunities to cooperate. I sense that, I see all that. Obviously, I\u2019m not in the White House and I don\u2019t know exactly how they feel, but that\u2019s what I sense.\nFirst of all, the ban on H20s, that\u2019s the limit of what we can do to Hopper, and we\u2019ve cut it down to there\u2019s not much left to cut. We\u2019ve written off \u2014 I think it\u2019s $5.5 billion \u2014 no company in history has ever written off that much inventory, so this additional ban on Nvidia\u2019s H20 is deeply painful. Its costs are enormously costly, not only am I losing $5.5 billion, we wrote off $5.5 billion, we walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably \u2014 what is it? \u2014 $3 billion worth of taxes. The China market is about $50 billion a year and it\u2019s not $50 million, it\u2019s $50 billion. $50 billion is like Boeing, not the plane, the whole company. To leave that behind so that the profits that go with that, the scale that goes with that, the ecosystem building that goes with that\u2014\nThat\u2019s the real threat to CUDA in the long run\u2014\nJH: That\u2019s right.\nChina builds an alternative.\nJH: Exactly. Anybody who thought that one chess move to somehow ban China from H20s would somehow cut off their ability to do AI is deeply uninformed.\nAI GDP Growth\nThere\u2019s an angle on this in the power stuff that I want to get to in a moment, but this is going to be more fun. Let\u2019s leave aside all the government stuff, we\u2019ll circle back around. A third way to get to my question about financial markets, governments, on today\u2019s keynote you started out by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re an infrastructure company, you need five-year roadmaps\u201d. You mentioned in passing that your original TAM estimate when you started Nvidia was $300 million. When did you actually see this coming, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be infrastructure?\u201d \u2014 again, I go back to our conversations previously, my sense from those is you just wanted people to see this possibility. You saw the possibility of GPU computing, but the scale, has it blown your mind just a little bit?\nJH: If you watch my keynotes, as you do, almost pretty consistently, things that are happening today, I spoke about five years ago. At the time when I was speaking about it five years ago, the words weren\u2019t as clear and the vocabulary I was using wasn\u2019t as precise, but where we were going is consistent.\nSo basically right now when you talk a lot about robotics at the end of every keynote, which you have been doing, that is our five-year preview that we should really be paying attention to.\nJH: Yeah. And in fact, I\u2019ve been talking about it for about three years.\nYeah, so a couple years from now.\nJH: It\u2019s a couple years from now, I think it\u2019s going to happen.\nThe thing that is fairly deep and fairly profound for this industry is that for all of the last 60 years we\u2019ve been the IT industry, which is a technology and tool, it\u2019s a technology and tool used by people \u2014 for the very first time, we\u2019re going to leave the IT budget, what we sell goes into the IT budget, we\u2019re about to leave the IT budget and into the manufacturing or the OpEx budget.\nThe manufacturing budget is because we\u2019re building robots or because robotic systems are being used to build products and then the OpEx is because of digital workers. The world\u2019s OpEx and CapEx is what? Combined $50 trillion? It\u2019s a giant number. So the IT industry is about a trillion, we\u2019re about to bring, because of AI, all of us into about a $50 trillion industry.\nOf course my first hope, and I think it will happen this way, although jobs will be changed and some jobs will be lost, a lot of jobs will be created. It is very likely that robotic systems where their agents are physical robots, will likely expand the world\u2019s GDP. The reason for that is we have a shortage of labor, that\u2019s why everybody\u2019s employed. If you go around the United States, unemployment is at all-time lows, and so it\u2019s because we just don\u2019t have enough labor. Restaurants are having a hard time filling staff, many factories are obviously having a very hard time filling staff. I think the idea that you would hire a robot for $100,000 a year, I think people will do that in a heartbeat and the reason for that is because it just increased their ability to generate more revenues, and so I think that that next five, ten years is we\u2019re likely to experience that expansion of GDP and a whole new industry of these token manufacturing systems that people now will understand.\nWhat I thought was also interesting about today\u2019s keynote is I prepped for this interview before I came and I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, it\u2019s probably going to be a bit of a rehash of GTC\u201d, and I thought it was actually pretty starkly different. Here\u2019s my interpretation, you have to let me know if it\u2019s correct. It felt like GTC was for the hyperscalers and today\u2019s presentation was for enterprise IT, it was like two different markets.\nJH: Yeah.\nDo I have that correct in terms of the target?\nJH: Enterprise IT or agents and robots, and agents for enterprise IT and robots for manufacturing and the reason for that is very clear, this is this the beginning of the ecosystem.\nYou made a beautiful video by the way of the Taiwan ecosystem and that goes into making all the pieces, that was really great.\nDynamo and Full-Stack Nvidia\nLet\u2019s go to the GTC keynote, that was one of my favorite keynotes of yours, I do watch them all and watched them all for years. Some real Professor Jensen energy, as you explain the limitations of data centers, why Nvidia was the answer, and I interpreted that as kind of an anti-ASIC message. You had a combination of, you showed your roadmap, it\u2019s like, \u201cTry to keep up with this\u201d, and then number two, you introduce the Pareto curve of latency versus bandwidth, and because they\u2019re programmable, you can use the same GPUs all over this curve and of course, hyperscalers are the ones that are going make ASICs.\nDo I have the right understanding of your presentation there?\nJH: I think the teachings was right, the reasons why I did it wasn\u2019t exactly that. I was simply trying to help people understand how to build a new data center. We\u2019ve been thinking about it and so here\u2019s the challenge. There\u2019s only so much energy in the data center. 100 megawatts is 100 megawatts, 250 megawatts is 250 megawatts and so your fundamental job, if it\u2019s a factory, is to make sure that the overall throughput-per-watt is the highest because that overall throughput in tokens, depending on if it\u2019s cheap, inexpensive tokens, meaning free-to-use tokens or the high quality tokens that somebody might pay actually say, a thousand dollars a month, $10,000 a month.\nWell you just mentioned a $100,000 AI assistant.\nJH: Exactly. Would I hire a $100,000/year AI agent? In a heartbeat. And the reason for that is we hire people way more expensive than that all day long and if I can just simply amplify somebody who I\u2019m paying $500,000 a year, that\u2019d be incredible, for a hundred thousand bucks, so of course I would.\nThe quality of tokens that you generate in a factory is quite varied. You need some that are free-to-use, you need some that are high quality and so you\u2019re across that Pareto. You can\u2019t design a chip or a system that is only good at one, because it\u2019ll be underutilized and so now the question is, how do you create a system that simultaneously, at some time, could be used for free token generation, some of it for free tokens, some of it for high quality?\nIf you cause the architecture to be too fragmented, then your ability to move workload back and forth is difficult and so I think when people go through the thinking of it, if you design a system that\u2019s very, very good at high token rate, it naturally has very low overall throughput. If you design something at a very high throughput, it tends to have very low interactivity, it\u2019s tokens-per-second per user is low and so it\u2019s easy to hug the X-axis, it\u2019s easy to hug the Y-axis, it\u2019s hard to fill out that area, and so that\u2019s the invention over all of the combination of what we did with the Blackwell architecture and FP4 and NVLink 72 and the ratio, the balance between HBM memory and its capacity, the balance between the amount of floating-point and the memory capacity and bandwidth and then very importantly, the Dynamo disaggregated streaming serving ecosystem, hardware system.\nI wanted to ask you about Dynamo, which did not come up today, but I think is super interesting.\nJH: Super important.\nGive me the pitch, I think you called it the operating system for data centers.\nJH: The pitch basically is that the inference workload, the transformer, has different stages of it, and different stages could be used differently depending on the user and depending on the model and depending on the context of that model and so we disaggregated the processing of the large language model into pre-fill, which is the context processing, thinking about what you\u2019re about to ask me. It has to do with my memories of Ben and the type of the deep and conversational podcasts like you like to do, and they tend to have \u2014 if I start talking deeply about the industry and the technology, I don\u2019t feel uncomfortable doing so.\nRight, you\u2019re not doing a sound byte right now for the evening news or something like that.\nJH: That\u2019s right. I feel like I can lean in and because you\u2019ll understand it, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m talking to the wall, and so I feel very comfortable talking about these things.\nWell, when an AI comes to a chatbot, the chatbot needs to have some of that context and so chatbots have memory, they process context, and they might even have to read a PDF or two, and so that\u2019s called a pre-fill part, that pre-fill part is very floating-point intensive.\nThen there\u2019s the decode part. The decode part is about now generating the thoughts, it\u2019s about reasoning through what you\u2019re about to say, predicting the next token and so a chain of thought basically generates a lot more tokens, which gets fed back into the context which generates more tokens, and so it\u2019s reasoning through a problem step-by-step, maybe it has to go off and read some stuff. The modern versions of AI, this agentic AI\u2019s, reasoning AI\u2019s, the amount of floating-point, the amount of bandwidth \u2014 decode requires a lot of bandwidth \u2014 is high in all cases, but it could be higher.\nIt varies.\nJH: That\u2019s right, it varies depending on things.\nYou don\u2019t need a high floating-point precision in the decode stage.\nJH: That\u2019s right. So for example, one-shot, and it\u2019s got a strong KV cache already, you don\u2019t need much floating-point. However, the moment you load it with context, you need a lot of floating-point. Dynamo disaggregates all the processing and it disperses it in the data center smartly metering the workload and metering the load on the processors, really complex stuff.\nWell, and it ties into, if the entire data center is one GPU, you\u2019re talking about a software layer that treats it that way.\nJH: That\u2019s right, it\u2019s essentially the operating system of an AI factory.\nWhen you think about these thinking models, these reasoning models, looking forward \u2014 you\u2019re someone, like you said, you have great predictions \u2014 do you see these being used mostly in agentic workflows and the downside of them is you\u2019re sitting around and waiting for them, or maybe you\u2019re setting up a bunch of agents that are acting in parallel, so that works out well, or they can actually end up being most important in generating data for training to get better one-shot results which is how people would interact more frequently?\nJH: I think depending on cost, and my prediction is that it\u2019s likely that reasoning models will just be the baseline, because we\u2019re going to process this so lightning fast. Basically when you turn on Grace Blackwell, it\u2019s 40 times faster, and let\u2019s say the next click is another 40 times faster and the models are getting better. So the idea that between now and five years from now that we could be 100,000 times faster for agentic models, very sensible to me.\nThat\u2019s the history of computing.\nJH: That\u2019s right. So it just thought about a mountain of things, you just didn\u2019t see it. It\u2019s a fast thinker now, even slow thinking is fast.\nWhat was that book? Thinking Fast and Slow, now apply that to AI. I guess it could read the whole thing in a second, so it might defeat the purpose.\nEnterprise AI and Pragmatism\nTo go back, just a quick little touch on politics. Is there a bit where your delivery in talking about this and your performance-per-watt, is that really a US-centric thing in a world where we have a hard time building power and power is the chief constraint? You look at something like these Gulf countries, power more accessible, easier to build for various reasons, and you go to China, guess what? If power is not the chief constraint, you can work through a lot of problems that Nvidia solves for you. Is that a reason GTC is in the US, that\u2019s the message for the US?\nJH: Oh, I didn\u2019t think of it that way. I think that no matter what happens, your factory will always be a certain size and even though your country has a lot more energy, your data center doesn\u2019t and so I think perf-per-watt is important, always.\nIt\u2019s always important, but the degree of importance may vary.\nJH: That\u2019s right, yeah. It\u2019s just that if you\u2019re planning for it, on the other hand you say, \u201cOkay, well I have an architecture that has half the performance-per-watt, and so maybe I\u2019ll just get twice as much land, and twice of some much power, and just start building that from the get go\u201d. When you put all that stuff together, though, this is the problem.\nRemember, even the infrastructure itself and the power delivery let\u2019s say for a gigawatt, let\u2019s just do some simple math. Let me just say $30 billion of it could be shell, power, land, operating it, all that $30 billion. Let\u2019s say the compute and the networking and everything, all in storage, $50 billion, okay? Well, if it turns out that you have to build twice as many, you just multiply your $30 by 2, so it\u2019s $60 billion and so you\u2019re going to have to get some really cheap compute to make up for it. That\u2019s why I always feel that in the world of AI factories, the math would suggest that if an architecture is not as good, sometimes depending on how poor it is, even free is not cheap enough.\nIf it\u2019s your only choice, you\u2019ll make it work.\nJH: That\u2019s right.\nWell, let\u2019s contrast that to today. You said a couple of times today, \u201cI love it if you buy everything from me, but I\u2019m happy you buy anything from me\u201d. It was funny before it fully crystallized for me that this feels like the enterprise keynote, which is again my words not yours, there was this sense of pragmatism that I\u2019m like, \u201cHe\u2019s sounding like an enterprise CEO right now, they\u2019re very pragmatic\u201d. Of course, if you buy the whole stack, it works better, and it\u2019s kind of interesting where if you\u2019re talking about building a full up AI factory, to use your words, of course using all Nvidia will maximize your returns from it, but there\u2019s a lot of customers out there that are just buying bits and pieces, and those customers, maybe you like them to buy the whole thing, but also if they buy anything from you, they\u2019re probably going to buy it from you forever. So it seems like just strategically, it\u2019s a very useful base to go for.\nJH: Serving a customer is just smart. If you look at the way Nvidia goes to market, we\u2019ve always built things in a fully integrated way because software needs to be integrated with hardware somehow, but we do it with enough discipline that we can then disaggregate the software from the hardware, and you could decide not to use our software, you can choose not to. And if you look at the way we design our systems, we\u2019ve actually disaggregated the systems in a sufficiently disciplined way, that if you wanted to replace some of it, you could. Right now, Grace Blackwell is being integrated, and stood up all over the world in different clouds and they\u2019re all based on our standards, but they\u2019re all a little bit different, and yet we fit into them.\nThat\u2019s I think the real challenge of Nvidia\u2019s business model, and it goes hand-in-hand with wanting to be a computing platform company. The most important thing is that one of Nvidia\u2019s stacks, if it\u2019s our compute stack, that\u2019s great. If our networking stack, which I feel deeply about and as strongly about as my computing stack, if my computing stack gets adopted all in all, terrific. If my networking stack gets adopted, terrific. If both of them gets adopted, incredible.\nWell, I mean, a lot of people, your NVLink Fusion, you can get just NVLink, you can integrate it with your ASIC with \u2014 again, total contrast to what I interpreted the GTC messaging \u2014 but again, I can see the view here. I mean, who\u2019s the customer?\nJH: I still have deep beliefs that Nvidia is building a better system overall, I still believe that. And if I don\u2019t believe that, then obviously we must be doing something wrong, and we\u2019ve got to go get ourselves to believe that, and so I completely believe that Nvidia is the largest scale accelerated computing company in the world, we\u2019re the largest scale AI computing company in the world. Nobody of 36-38,000 people is united to this one job than any place ever and so the idea that a small team of 14 people could do a better job than us would be quite painful to internalize, and so we strive to do better.\nHowever, you also believe in scale, and a great way to get scale in everything that you\u2019re selling is to sell it however the customer wants it.\nJH: That\u2019s right, exactly. That\u2019s exactly right. So I have preferences, but we want to make sure that we\u2019re able to serve every customer however they\u2019d like to be served.\nWhither Gaming\nAlong these lines, and maybe this is related: I was asking a friend of mine about this interview and he said his son insisted that I ask this question. Some people in gaming feel, you mentioned it today, only 10% of the keynote is about GeForce, but that\u2019s still important to us. Is that a, \u201cIt\u2019s still important to us because this all scales and we\u2019re making GPUs?\u201d, or what should I tell my friend\u2019s son about Nvidia and gaming?\nJH: See, I wish I had said it, RTX PRO wouldn\u2019t be possible without GeForce, Omniverse wouldn\u2019t be possible without GeForce, not one of those pixels that we saw in any of those videos would\u2019ve been possible without GeForce, robots wouldn\u2019t be possible without GeForce, Newton is not possible without GeForce, so GeForce itself, they\u2019re not as deeply part of the GTC event because GTC tends to be about high-performance computing, and enterprise, and AI, and things like that. We have a separate conference for game developers and things like that and so it\u2019s just that when I do GTC, I got a group of people that I always feel a little badly about that their product launch isn\u2019t as central, but it\u2019s just not the right audience, but they also know that GeForce plays such an integral role in everything that we do.\nI mean, is there a bit that maybe the gamers just don\u2019t fully appreciate the extent to which their GeForce\u2019s are much more than just graphic rendering engines at this point?\nJH: (laughing) Yeah, right. Exactly. And I said it today, we\u2019re only rendering 1 out of 10 pixels, it\u2019s a shocking number. Suppose I gave you a puzzle, and I gave you 1 out of 10 pieces and the other 10 pieces I\u2019m not even going to give you, you\u2019ve just got to make them up.\nI got another pitch for you to connect gaming to your other things. You just talked about how you\u2019re disciplined about keeping things separate, and being able to separate it and software managing all that. Kind of sounds like the driver problem on Windows, to be totally honest, that\u2019s just a core skill set that you have.\nJH: Yeah, it\u2019s just a driver is too low-level, and it\u2019s got too many things, too many registers and the driver abstraction was actually a revolution that Microsoft really played a very large role in. Windows wouldn\u2019t be where Windows is if not for this concept of a driver, and it created an abstraction of an API while underneath the hardware can change fairly significantly.\nWe\u2019re open source, our driver now, and quite frankly, I don\u2019t see that many people contributing to it, and the reason for that is because the moment I come up with another GPU, all the work that they did in the last driver is kind of thrown away, and so without a large body of engineers like Nvidia has, it\u2019s hard to do. But if we optimize every GPU for every driver with its associated driver, then there\u2019s a wonderful isolation layer, an abstraction layer, whether it\u2019s CUDA or DirectX, that people could build on top of.\nLook, here\u2019s my answer to my friend\u2019s son. I had to ask you about the government stuff, and you gave a good and passionate defense of your view, but you truly got excited and your eyes lit up when I asked about gaming drivers.\nJH: Oh, is that right?\nSo I think everything\u2019s still good.\nJH: Oh good. Yeah, I love GeForce actually.\nThere you go, that\u2019s why it\u2019s good to speak in-person. Jensen Huang, thank you very much.\nThis Daily Update Interview is also available as a podcast.

      "text": "Apple commits another $100 billion for U.S. manufacturing amid Trump tariffs\n- Share via\nApple, which was singled out by the Trump administration earlier this year over its production practices, took a further step to highlight its commitment to boosting investment in the U.S.\nThe tech giant pledged to spend an additional $100 billion on domestic manufacturing, a move that could ease tensions with President Trump who wants iPhones built in the United States.\nApple also said for the first time all of the cover glass on iPhone and Apple Watch units will be made in the United States at Corning\u2019s Harrodsburg, Ky., manufacturing facility.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep building technologies at the heart of our products right here in America because we\u2019re a proud American company, and we believe deeply in the promise of this great nation,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said at a White House event.\nTrump praised Cook before the tech mogul opened a white box with Apple\u2019s logo, showcasing engraved glass before placing it on a base made of gold from Utah.\n\u201cThis is the largest investment Apple has ever made in America and anywhere else and it\u2019s just an honor to have you,\u201d Trump said.\nApple said it aims to bring more of its supply chain to the U.S. as part of a new manufacturing program, confirming an earlier report from Bloomberg.\nThe company said in a new release it is working with Samsung, Applied Materials and Texas Instruments, among other businesses.\nPresident Trump threatened to impose a tariff of at least 25% on Apple if the smartphone maker doesn\u2019t build and manufacture iPhones in the United States.\nApple\u2019s commitment will increase its U.S. investment to $600 billion over four years as it seeks to avoid the cost of tariffs.\nThe Cupertino-based company announced a $500-billion U.S. investment commitment in February.\nNonetheless, Trump in May criticized Apple for expanding iPhone production in India, threatening to hit the company with a 25% tariff.\nTrump said that his administration is placing a 100% tariff on chips and semiconductors, but if companies such as Apple are building in the U.S. \u201cthere\u2019s no charge.\u201d\nApple and other tech companies have touted their U.S. commitments, but analysts and economists have said shifting manufacturing to the United States could take years and result in higher prices for smartphones and other popular electronics.\nSome analysts have said it would take at least five years for Apple to shift production to the U.S. and the prices of iPhones could reach $3,500 if the smartphone was made in America.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is made up of roughly 2,700 parts sourced from 187 suppliers in 28 countries, according to an April report from TechInsights.\nCook said at the press conference that Apple\u2019s iPhone will be made elsewhere for a while, but Trump said his administration might incentivize the company to bring that entirely back to the U.S.\nAs companies look to keep costs down and consumers watch their budgets, tariffs add another wrinkle to efforts to slash spending.\nTaylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement, that the Trump and Apple\u2019s announcement is \u201canother win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America\u2019s economic and national security.\u201d\nBusinesses that rely on goods imported from India are preparing for a 25% tariff to take effect as President Trump\u2019s trade war with once-strong trade partners continues.\nThe move marks the latest apparent effort by Apple to show its commitment to hiring U.S. workers.\nLast month, the smartphone leader announced the opening of its Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit. The program begins Aug. 19 and offers free workshops on artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing to small and medium-sized businesses.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Apple has vowed to invest in U.S. manufacturing. In 2021, during the Biden administration, the smartphone maker said it would invest $430 billion over five years in the United States.\nTech companies including OpenAI, Taiwan semiconductor company TSMC and chipmaker Nvidia have tried to forge strong ties with Trump who has gone back and forth about tariffs.\nCook has been meeting with Trump and joined other tech executives who donated and attended the presidential inauguration earlier this year. Trump tapped Elon Musk, who runs Tesla and SpaceX, to lead a controversial effort to slash government spending. The White House hosted a crypto summit and released an AI action plan that benefits tech companies.\nApple has relied heavily on China to manufacture popular products such as the iPhone but has been diversifying its supply chain especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhile there\u2019s a perception that companies turn to China because of low labor costs, Cook has said the smartphone maker benefits from the skills possessed by tooling engineers there that\u2019s needed to build a high-quality product.\nApple has more than 450,000 jobs with thousands of suppliers and partners across all 50 states.\nWhile Apple designs its products in California, it also relies on a global supply chain involving various countries including China, Vietnam and India.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s tariffs will significantly hurt Silicon Valley tech companies like Apple, which has manufacturing operations in China, Vietnam and India.\nApple is already spending more because of Trump\u2019s tariffs. Last week, Cook said during an earnings call that the company has incurred roughly $800 million in tariff-related costs. Apple expects $1.1 billion in tariff-related costs in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in September.\nApple\u2019s stock closed up 5% at 213.28 per share on Wednesday."

      "text": "Samsung to make Tesla AI chips in multiyear Texas deal\n- Share via\nSamsung Electronics Co. will produce AI semiconductors for Tesla Inc. in a new $16.5-billion pact that marks a win for its underperforming foundry division.\nSouth Korea\u2019s largest company announced Monday that it secured the 22.8 trillion-won chipmaking agreement, which will run through the end of 2033. The plan is for an upcoming plant in Taylor, Texas, to produce Tesla\u2019s next-generation AI6 chip, Tesla chief Elon Musk said on X, confirming a Bloomberg News report.\nSamsung\u2019s Seoul-traded shares rose 6.8% to their highest since September, while its suppliers like Soulbrain Co. jumped 16%. A Samsung spokesperson declined to comment, citing confidentiality terms in its contract.\n\u201cThe strategic importance of this is hard to overstate,\u201d Musk, 54, wrote on X. He described the value of the deal announced by Samsung as \u201cjust the bare minimum. Actual output is likely to be several times higher.\u201d\nThe Tesla chief executive officer and X owner will walk the chip fabrication line himself and has been authorized by Samsung to assist in optimizing production, he said. The AI6 component will form the foundation of Tesla\u2019s driving hardware suite for cars in coming years. Samsung produces the current AI4 system, according to Musk.\nThe contract win, the first after Executive Chairman Jay Y. Lee was cleared of all outstanding legal charges, comes as Samsung has been steadily losing ground in chip manufacturing. The company, which makes its own memory chips and also fabricates semiconductors on behalf of clients, has had difficulty bringing in enough orders to fully use its foundry capacity. It has postponed completion of construction and operational ramp-up of its new Texas fab to 2026.\n\u201cTheir foundry business has been loss-making and struggling with under-utilization, so this will help a lot,\u201d said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee in Singapore. \u201cTesla\u2019s business may also help them to attract other customers.\u201d\nThat\u2019s in contrast to leading chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which still cannot meet all demand. TSMC held a dominant share of 67.6% of the global foundry market in the first quarter this year, according to Taipei-based TrendForce. Samsung\u2019s share slipped to 7.7% from 8.1% in the previous quarter.\nSamsung and TSMC are both on pace to deliver the next generation of semiconductor advancement \u2014 moving to 2-nanometer fabrication \u2014 and the new deal is seen as a signal of confidence for the company\u2019s upcoming fabrication technology.\nWhile the contract may represent a small share of foundry revenue annually, it holds greater value as a catalyst for technological refinement and innovation over the long run, according to Ryu Young-ho, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities Co. It also helps burnish Samsung\u2019s reputation as the strongest TSMC alternative at a time when Intel Corp. is struggling to win over investors skeptical about its long-term strategy and road map.\nAt Tesla, Musk has said the company\u2019s future will depend on delivering the long-elusive goal of true self-driving technology. Last week, after a disappointing earnings report, he said the automaker will face \u201ca few rough quarters\u201d until it can deliver autonomous vehicles at scale \u2014 which he predicted for the second half of 2026 or by the end of the year.\nYet there is still skepticism about that target. Musk\u2019s X posts following the Samsung deal imply that Tesla will adopt two different next-generation chips in short order that are crucial to its automated-driving systems. He wrote that the carmaker will go from currently sourcing AI4 chips from Samsung, to using AI5 chips from TSMC that have just been designed, to then using AI6 chips from Samsung.\nThe rapid-fire changes risk opening Tesla up to more blowback from car owners who were told in 2016 that all the vehicles the company was making from then on had the hardware necessary to eventually drive autonomously. In early 2023, Musk said on an earnings call that Tesla was going to stop offering retrofits to customers whose cars were equipped with older-generation chips, citing the cost and difficulty of offering upgrades.\nTesla has made some progress in recent months toward competing with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo by starting to offer a driverless taxi service in Austin. But the carmaker has yet to offer rides without any safety staff in its vehicles, and early users posted videos of the robotaxis appearing to violate traffic laws. The suite of features Tesla markets as Full Self-Driving still requires customers to supervise the system at all times.\nLee and Kang write for Bloomberg."

      "text": "U.S. will get a 15% cut of Nvidia and AMD chip sales to China under an unusual deal\n- Share via\nNEW YORK \u2014 Nvidia and AMD have agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the U.S. government, as part of a deal to secure export licenses for the semiconductors.\nThe Trump administration halted the sale of advanced computer chips to China in April over national security concerns, but Nvidia and AMD revealed in July that Washington would allow them to resume sales of the H20 and MI308 chips, which are used in artificial intelligence development.\nPresident Trump confirmed the terms of the unusual arrangement in a Monday news conference while noting that he originally wanted 20% of the sales revenue when Nvidia asked to sell the \u201cobsolete\u201d H20 chip to China. The president credited Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang for negotiating him down to 15%.\n\u201cSo we negotiated a little deal. So he\u2019s selling a essentially old chip,\u201d Trump said.\nNvidia did not comment about the specific details of the agreement or its quid pro quo nature, but said they would adhere to the export rules laid out by the administration.\n\u201cWe follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. While we haven\u2019t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide,\u201d Nvidia wrote in a statement to the AP. \u201cAmerica cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership. America\u2019s AI tech stack can be the world\u2019s standard if we race.\u201d\nAMD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe top Democrat on a House panel focusing on competition with China raised concerns over the reported agreement, calling it \u201ca dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security.\u201d\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on China, said he would seek answers about the legal basis for this arrangement and demand full transparency from the administration.\n\u201cOur export control regime must be based on genuine security considerations, not creative taxation schemes disguised as national security policy,\u201d he said. \u201cChip export controls aren\u2019t bargaining chips, and they\u2019re not casino chips either. We shouldn\u2019t be gambling with our national security to raise revenue.\u201d\nDerek Scissors, senior fellow and China expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, questioned the constitutionality of the deal and also warned against risking national security for revenue.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no precedent for this, probably because export taxes are unconstitutional,\u201d Scissors said. \u201cThey call it a fee, but 15% of sales revenue is about a standard a tax as it comes. For this reason, I don\u2019t think the \u2018arrangement\u2019 is at all durable. \u2018\u2019\n\u201cIf it were to last, it has two possible implications. First, there\u2019s a possible export tax that high-profile companies and goods must consider. Or the tax only applies in exceptional situations, such as changing export controls. Then we\u2019d risk national security for the sake of tax revenue, which is effectively the same as cutting the defense budget,\u201d Scissors said.\nIn July, Nvidia argued that tight export controls around the chip sales would cost the company an extra $5.5 billion. It has argued that such limits hinder U.S. competition in a sector in one of the world\u2019s largest markets for technology, and has also warned that U.S. export controls could end up pushing other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC in July that the renewed sale of Nvidia\u2019s chips in China was linked to a trade agreement made between the two countries on rare-earth magnets.\nRestrictions on sales of advanced chips to China have been central to the AI race between the world\u2019s two largest economic powers, but such controls are also controversial. Proponents argue that these restrictions are necessary to slow China down enough to allow U.S. companies to keep their lead.\nMeanwhile, opponents say the export controls have loopholes \u2014 and could still spur innovation. The emergence of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI chatbot in January particularly renewed concerns over how the Asian nation might use advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities.\nAssociated Press writers Josh Boak, Shawn Chen, Didi Tang and Paul Wiseman contributed to this report."
