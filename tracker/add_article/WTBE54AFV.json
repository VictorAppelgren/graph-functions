      "summary": "The article outlines six key success factors for establishing corporate growth units, emphasizing the importance of leveraging existing assets, starting small with experiments, scaling from day one, implementing an explore management system, fostering strong links to the parent company, and building internal capabilities. It highlights successes at IBM, AGC, RELX, and UNIQA, while cautioning against common pitfalls such as overexpansion and misaligned metrics. The authors argue that disciplined ambidexterity—balancing exploitation of core strengths with exploration of new opportunities—is essential for sustained growth beyond the operational core.",
