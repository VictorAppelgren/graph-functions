  "content": "ATLANTA, Sept. 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- CENTEGIX\u00ae is honored to announce that Moore Public Schools (OK) has chosen to implement the full CENTEGIX Safety Platform\u00ae, including CrisisAlert\u2122, Safety Blueprint\u00ae, and Enhanced Visitor Management. The district's selection underscores its commitment to championing Alyssa's Law and leading the way in strengthening safety and security across all campuses.\n\nMoore Public Schools' decision to implement the CENTEGIX Safety Platform is part of a comprehensive strategy to increase safety for its students, staff, and community.\n\n\"Our responsibility is to ensure real safety, not just check a compliance box. During our evaluation, it became clear that a simple wearable wasn't enough. We chose CENTEGIX because they are the only solution that provides precise, room-level location data\u2014which is critical for responders\u2014and pairs it with visual strobes in every classroom and across campus.\"\n\n\"In a crisis, that visual alert cuts through the noise and ensures the message is received by everyone, instantly. That's a level of reliability and effectiveness we couldn't find anywhere else,\" said Moore Public Schools Director of Safety and Security Dustin Hortstkoetter . \"As an Alyssa's Law-approved provider by the Oklahoma State Department of Education, CENTEGIX brings proven expertise as the leader in wearable panic buttons.\"\n\nWhy CENTEGIX is the best choice for Oklahoma School Districts\n\nCrisisAlert equips every staff member with a wearable badge that empowers them to quickly and discreetly get help during emergencies ranging from medical situations to campus-wide threats. The badge is easy to use under stress and works indoors and outdoors. CrisisAlert provides responders with precise, room-level location details on dynamic digital maps and delivers critical alert information directly to 911. Full audio and visual notifications\u2014flashing strobes, intercom announcements, and screen takeovers\u2014instantly alert everyone to activate safety protocols. Strobes are an essential component and are included in every installation \u2013 in every room, hallway, and common area, providing an immediate visual notice of the emergency.\n\nCENTEGIX Visitor Management empowers campuses to quickly and efficiently check in and authenticate visitors. Enhanced Visitor Management leverages a highly visible CENTEGIX visitor badge with built-in real-time locating capabilities so administrators can assign and locate volunteers, contractors, parents, and guests using a live campus map.",
