      "summary": "The Premier League returns with Liverpool, the 20th‑title champions, launching a record‑spending campaign that includes a £116m signing of Florian Wirtz and new full‑backs, while Arsenal bolster their attack with Viktor Gyokeres and City refresh their squad with Reijnders, Aït‑Nouri and Cherki. Manchester United, under new manager Ruben Amorim, are rebuilding after a disastrous 15th‑place finish, adding Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo while considering sales to meet financial rules. Newly promoted clubs Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland face a widening gap to the top tier, and Everton move into a new stadium amid a search for goal‑scoring options. The season also sees Puma replace Nike as ball supplier, new rule tweaks such as eight‑second goalkeeper hold, and all 380 matches broadcast on NBC in the U.S.}",
