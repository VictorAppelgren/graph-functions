Intel has faced significant challenges, including layoffs and project cancellations, and is under scrutiny from President Trump, who has called for the resignation of CEO Lip-Bu Tan due to his ties with Chinese companies. Former Intel CEO Craig Barrett has suggested that Intel's customers should invest $40 billion in the company to ensure a stable supply of semiconductors, emphasizing the need for domestic manufacturing.",
