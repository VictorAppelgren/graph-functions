  "content": "Empathy is usually regarded as a virtue, a key to human decency and kindness. And yet, with increasing momentum, voices on the Christian right are preaching that it has become a vice.\n\nFor them, empathy is a cudgel for the left: It can manipulate caring people into accepting all manner of sins according to a conservative Christian perspective, including abortion access, LGBTQ+ rights, illegal immigration and certain views on social and racial justice.\n\n\u201cEmpathy becomes toxic when it encourages you to affirm sin, validate lies or support destructive policies,\u201d said Allie Beth Stuckey, author of \u201cToxic Empathy: How Progressives Exploit Christian Compassion.\u201d\n\nMs. Stuckey, host of the popular podcast \u201cRelatable,\u201d is one of two evangelicals who published books within the past year making Christian arguments against some forms of empathy.\n\nThe other is Joe Rigney, a professor and pastor who wrote \u201cThe Sin of Empathy: Compassion and its Counterfeits.\u201d It was published by Canon Press, an affiliate of Mr. Rigney\u2019s conservative denomination, which counts Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth among its members.\n\nThese anti-empathy arguments gained traction in the early months of President Trump\u2019s second term, with his flurry of executive orders that critics denounced as lacking empathy.\n\nAs foreign aid stopped and more deportations began, Mr. Trump\u2019s then-adviser Elon Musk told podcaster Joe Rogan: \u201cThe fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy.\u201d\n\nEven Vice President J.D. Vance, a Catholic convert, framed the idea in his own religious terms, invoking the concept of ordo amoris, or order of love. Within concentric circles of importance, he argued the immediate family comes first and the wider world last \u2014 an interpretation that then-Pope Francis rejected.\n\nWhile their anti-empathy arguments have differences, Ms. Stuckey and Mr. Rigney have audiences that are firmly among Mr. Trump\u2019s Christian base.\n\n\u201cCould someone use my arguments to justify callous indifference to human suffering? Of course,\u201d Mr. Rigney said, countering that he still supports measured Christ-like compassion. \u201cI think I\u2019ve put enough qualifications.\u201d\n\nHistorian Susan Lanzoni traced a century of empathy\u2019s uses and definitions in her 2018 book \u201cEmpathy: A History.\u201d Though it\u2019s had its critics, she has never seen the aspirational term so derided as it is now.\n\nIt\u2019s been particularly jarring to watch Christians take down empathy, said Ms. Lanzoni, a graduate of Harvard Divinity School. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole message of Jesus, right?\u201d\n\nThe word empathy appeared in English for the first time in 1908, taken from a German word, meaning \u201cin-feeling.\u201d\n\nThough the word is relatively new to English, the impulse behind it \u2014 to feel for or with another \u2014 is much older. It forms a core precept across many religions. \u201cDo unto others as you would have them do unto you,\u201d reads a common version of the Golden Rule.\n\nMs. Stuckey admits Jesus is an empathetic figure. In her book, the Southern Baptist from Texas writes, \u201cIn a way, Jesus embodied empathy when he took on flesh, suffered the human experience, and bore the burden of our sins by enduring a gruesome death.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s clear that empathy can be good. But she writes it has been co-opted \u201cto convince people that the progressive position is exclusively the one of kindness and morality.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you really care about women, you\u2019ll support their right to choose,\u201d she writes of this progressive line of thinking. \u201cIf you really respect people, you\u2019ll use preferred pronouns. \u2026 If you\u2019re really compassionate, you\u2019ll welcome the immigrant.\u201d\n\nMr. Rigney doesn\u2019t think empathy is inherently wrong, either. He finds fault with excessive or \u201cuntethered empathy\u201d that\u2019s not tied to conservative biblical interpretations.\n\nHe has been talking publicly about these ideas since at least 2018, when he discussed the sin of empathy on camera with conservative Pastor Doug Wilson. Since 2023, Mr. Rigney has worked at Mr. Wilson\u2019s Idaho church and seminary, affiliated with the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches.\n\nMr. Rigney said initially he experienced pushback from \u201ccertain corners of evangelicalism, that at the time were very dialed into questions of the #MeToo movement and abuse or critical race theory, social justice kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nThis debate over empathy often devolves into arguments over word choices or semantics. Mr. Rigney prefers older terms like compassion, sympathy or even pity.\n\nThe Rev. Albert Mohler leads the flagship seminary of the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest U.S. Protestant denomination. He featured Mr. Rigney and Ms. Stuckey on his podcast this year and agrees with their empathy critiques.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no market so far as I know for empathy cards,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a long-standing market for sympathy cards.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Mr. Mohler did encourage his audience to have empathy. His words came after a White police officer killed Michael Brown, a Black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\n\u201cI look back at that statement now, and I would say it\u2019s nowhere near as morally significant as I intended it to be at the time,\u201d Mr. Mohler said. Though expressing empathy for hurting people appeared to be \u201cclose to the right thing to do,\u201d he sees it as less helpful now.\n\nMs. Stuckey traces her own anti-empathy awakening to the summer of 2020, when racial justice protests roiled the nation. She saw other Christians posting about racism out of an empathy she found misguided.\n\n\u201cI reject the idea that America is a systemically racist country,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen she said as much in the months after George Floyd\u2019s murder, her audience grew.\n\nMr. Rigney echoes this critique of systemic racism but reserves most of his ire for feminism, which he blames for many of empathy\u2019s ills. Because women are the more empathetic sex, he argues, they often take empathy too far.\n\nHe found an encapsulation of this theory at Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural prayer service, where a woman preached from the pulpit. During a sermon that went viral, Episcopal Bishop Mariann Budde pleaded with the Republican president to \u201chave mercy\u201d on immigrants and LGBTQ+ people, prompting a conservative backlash.\n\n\u201cBudde\u2019s attempt to \u2018speak truth to power\u2019 is a reminder that feminism is a cancer that enables the politics of empathetic manipulation,\u201d Mr. Rigney wrote for the evangelical World magazine.\n\n\u201cEmpathy is not toxic. Nor is it a sin,\u201d the Rev. Canon Dana Colley Corsello said in a sermon at Washington National Cathedral, two months after Bishop Budde\u2019s plea from that sanctuary.\n\n\u201cThe arguments about toxic empathy are finding open ears because far-right-wing, White evangelicals are looking for a moral framework around which they can justify President Trump\u2019s executive orders and policies,\u201d Ms. Corsello preached.\n\n\u201cEmpathy is at the heart of Jesus\u2019 life and ministry,\u201d Ms. Corsello wrote in a recent email exchange about the sermon.\n\nShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s so troubling that this is even up for debate.\u201d",

  "summary": "Some conservative Christians argue that the use of empathy, a key to human decency and kindness, has become a vice. They argue that it can manipulate people into accepting certain sins such as abortion access, LGBTQ+ rights, illegal immigration, and social justice. Author Allie Beth Stuckey, host of the popular podcast \"Relatable,\" argues that empathy becomes toxic when it encourages people to affirm sin, validate lies, or support destructive policies. These arguments gained traction during President Trump's second term, with critics criticising his executive orders lacking empathy. While their arguments differ, both Stuckeys and Rigney have audiences among Mr. Trump's Christian base. The word empathy first appeared in English in 1908, a century of its uses and definitions, and is a core precept across many religions.",

  "argos_summary": "The article discusses how some evangelical leaders, notably Allie Beth Stuckey and Joe Rigney, argue that empathy has become a tool of the political left, co\u2011opting Christian compassion to support progressive causes such as abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, and immigration. They claim that unchecked empathy can validate sin and justify harmful policies, and their views have gained traction among Trump\u2011aligned Christian voters. The piece contrasts these critiques with historians and other clergy who defend empathy as a core Christian value, noting that the debate often centers on semantics and the perceived misuse of empathy in contemporary politics.",
