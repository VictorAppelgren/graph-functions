      "title": "Giovanni Leoni: Italy’s next great defensive hope is ready to learn from Virgil van Dijk at Liverpool",
      "summary": "The piece traces Fabio Cannavaro’s historic 2006 Ballon d’Or win and reflects on Italy’s fluctuating defensive fortunes, highlighting the emergence of young centre‑backs such as Giovanni Leoni who has just moved to Liverpool. It contrasts Leoni’s rapid rise with the broader Italian football landscape, noting the country’s struggle to field competitive defenders beyond the traditional “big three” clubs and the growing trend of Italian talent moving to the Premier League. The article also revisits the Calciopoli scandal that devastated Juventus, detailing the club’s relegation, point deductions, and long‑running legal battles, while drawing parallels to Manchester City’s current 115‑charge investigation. Together, the narrative underscores how past controversies and shifting player pathways continue to shape Italian football’s identity and its relationship with European competitions.",
