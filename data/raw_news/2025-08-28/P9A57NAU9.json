  "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Rev. Al Sharpton will lead a protest march on Wall Street to urge corporate America to resist the Trump administration\u2019s campaign to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nThe New York civil rights leader will join clergy, labor and community leaders Thursday in a demonstration through Manhattan\u2019s Financial District that's timed with the anniversary of the Civil Rights-era March on Washington in 1963.\n\nSharpton, in a statement, called DEI the \u201ccivil rights fight of our generation.\"\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump has moved to end DEI programswithin the federal government and warned schools to do the same, or risk losing federal money.\n\nIn response, Sharpton's civil rights group, the National Action Network, has encouraged consumers to avoid U.S. retailers that scaled backed policies and programs aimed at bolstering diversity among their employees and reducing discrimination against members of minority groups, women and LGBTQ+ people.\n\nEarlier this year, Sharpton met with Target\u2019s CEO as groups called for a boycott of the retail giant, which joined Amazon (AMZN), Walmart and other major retailers in foregoing DEI initiatives.\n\nThe civil rights leader has also called for \"buy-cotts\u201d in support of companies such as Costco (COST) that have stuck by their DEI principles despite the conservative backlash.\n\n\u201cCorporate America wants to walk away from Black communities, so we are marching to them to bring this fight to their doorstep,\u201d Sharpton said in a statement ahead of Thursday's march.\n\nThe march is expected to start around 10 a.m. in Foley Square, located in downtown Manhattan near the African Burial Ground that's the largest known resting place of enslaved and freed Africans in the country.\n\nThe square is also near 26 Federal Plaza, the federal government building that's become a symbol of Trump's nationwide immigration crackdown.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been detaining migrants during their routine appearances at the immigration court located there. A federal judge earlier this month also ordered the Trump administration to improve conditions for migrants jailed there.\n\nMarchers are expected to make their way past Wall Street's famous Charging Bull statue before the event ends with a speaking program.\n\nNew York City mayoral candidates, including incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, state Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, are among those expected to join the demonstration.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "K-12 schools must sign certification against DEI to receive federal money, administration says\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As a condition for receiving federal money, the Trump administration is ordering K-12 schools to certify that they are following federal civil rights laws and ending any discriminatory diversity, equity and inclusion practices.\nA notice sent Thursday by the Education Department gives states and schools 10 days to sign and return the certification. It\u2019s the latest escalation against DEI policies, apparently giving the Republican administration a new lever for terminating federal money.\n\u201cFederal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right,\u201d Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a statement. He said many schools have flouted their legal obligations, \u201cincluding by using DEI programs to discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another.\u201d\nThe certification asks state and school leaders to sign a \u201creminder of legal obligations\u201d acknowledging their federal money is conditioned on compliance with federal civil rights laws. It also demands compliance with several pages of legal analysis written by the administration.\n\u201cThe use of certain DEI practices can violate federal law,\u201d the administration wrote in the certification, adding that it is illegal for programs to advantage one race over another.\nSchools and states that use illegal DEI practices can face a loss of federal money, including grants and contracts, and can be held liable under the False Claims Act, according to the certification. It specifically threatens Title I funding, which sends billions of dollars a year to America\u2019s schools and targets low-income areas.\nThe department ordered state education offices to sign the certification and collect certifications from school systems.\nIt follows a Feb. 14 memo declaring that any school policy that treats students or staff differently because of their race is illegal. It aimed to fight what the memo described as widespread discrimination in education, often against white and Asian American students.\nThe certification letter drew blowback from critics who said it conflicts with Trump\u2019s promise to return education to schools and states.\n\u201cIs this what the Trump administration calls local control? You can\u2019t say you\u2019re giving control back to states and then dictate how they run their schools,\u201d said Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union.\nThe new memo appears to lay the groundwork for financial sanctions of the kind the Trump administration has leveraged against colleges. Columbia University recently agreed to several demands after the federal government cut $400 million amid an investigation into campus antisemitism.\nThe government has used similar tactics at Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania.\nSchools across the U.S. have been scrambling to determine what practices could run afoul of the anti-DEI orders, but the new letter does little to add clarity.\nThe initial February memo declared that federal law prohibits schools and colleges from \u201cusing race\u201d in decisions related to admissions, hiring financial aid, housing, student life and more. As justification, it invoked a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring affirmative action in college admissions \u2014 a case focused on admissions practices at Harvard and the University of North Carolina.\nThe department later clarified that some practices are allowed, including Black History Month celebrations and programs focused on certain cultures, but it said many schools have \u201cadvanced discriminatory policies and practices under the banner of \u2018DEI\u2019 initiatives.\u201d\nThe American Federation of Teachers, a national teachers\u2019 union, is suing to block the Feb. 14 memo, saying it violates the First and Fifth amendments.\nThe union\u2019s president called the certification requirement illegal, saying federal law prohibits the White House from telling schools and colleges what to teach, and that federal money cannot be withheld without due process.\n\u201cHe\u2019s wielding a cudgel of billions in federal aid to tens of millions of children, of all races and ethnicities, to force educators to kowtow to his politics and ideology,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT.\n___\nThe Associated Press\u2019 education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

      "text": "Judge orders ICE to improve conditions after NYC immigration detainees complain of mistreatment\nJudge orders ICE to improve conditions after NYC immigration detainees complain of mistreatment\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A federal judge ordered the Trump administration Tuesday to immediately improve conditions at a New York City immigration holding facility, acting on complaints by jailed migrants that it is dirty, smelly and overcrowded.\nJudge Lewis A. Kaplan, ruling in a lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees, issued a temporary restraining order requiring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to limit capacity, ensure cleanliness and provide sleeping mats in so-called hold rooms at 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in Manhattan.\nCellphone video recorded last month by a detainee showed about two dozen men crowded in one of the building\u2019s four hold rooms, many lying on the floor with thermal blankets but no mattresses or padding.\nIn court filings, detainees complained they had no soap, toothbrushes or other hygiene products. They said they were fed inedible \u201cslop\u201d and endured the \u201chorrific stench\u201d of sweat, urine and feces, in part because the rooms have open toilets. One woman having her period couldn\u2019t use menstrual products because women in her room were given just two to divvy up, the lawsuit said.\nKaplan ordered immigration officials to allocate 50 square feet (4.6 square meters) per person \u2014 shrinking the largest hold room\u2019s capacity to about 15 people after detainees said 40 or more were being jammed in. The building, home to immigration court and the FBI\u2018s New York field office, has become an epicenter of President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration.\nThe judge ordered the government to thoroughly clean the cells three times a day and provide an adequate supply of hygiene products. Addressing concerns that detainees weren\u2019t able to communicate with lawyers, Kaplan ordered the government to make accommodations for confidential legal telephone calls.\n\u201cMy conclusion here is that there is a very serious threat of continuing irreparable injury, given the conditions that I\u2019ve been told about,\u201d Kaplan said at a hearing Tuesday where a government lawyer conceded that some of the complaints were valid.\n\u201cI think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,\u201d government lawyer Jeffrey S. Oestericher said, adding that he agreed \u201cinhumane conditions are not appropriate and should not be tolerated.\u201d\nThe lawsuit \u2014 filed by the immigrant rights organization Make the Road New York, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the American Civil Liberties Union \u2014 sought court intervention to end what plaintiff lawyer Heather Gregorio called \u201cinhumane and horrifying conditions.\u201d\nSome detainees have been held at 26 Federal Plaza far longer than the 72-hour norm, Gregorio said.\nMurad Awawdeh, the president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, welcomed Kaplan\u2019s ruling as a \u201cstep forward\u201d but said the facility \u201cmust be shut down permanently.\u201d\nNew York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who was arrested at 26 Federal Plaza in June after he tried to lock arms with a person authorities were attempting to detain, said the decision \u201cis a much-needed rebuke of Trump\u2019s cruel immigration policies.\u201d\nIn a sworn declaration, Nancy Zanello, of ICE\u2019s New York City Field Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, wrote that as of Monday, a total of 24 people were held in the building\u2019s four hold rooms \u2014 well shy of the city fire marshal\u2019s 154-person cap.\nEach room has at least one toilet and sink, and hygiene products are available, including soap, teeth cleaning wipes and feminine products, Zanello said.\nSergio Barco Mercado, the lawsuit\u2019s named plaintiff, said in a court filing that he was held at 26 Federal Plaza for two days last week after his arrest there while leaving an immigration court hearing.\nBarco Mercado, a native of Peru who said he sought asylum in the U.S. in 2022, said his hold room was \u201cextremely crowded,\u201d cold and \u201csmelled of sewage,\u201d and that the conditions exacerbated a tooth infection that swelled his face and altered his speech.\n\u201cWe did not always get enough water,\u201d Barco Mercado said. \u201cThere was one guard who would sometimes hold a bottle of water up and people would wait to have him squirt some into our mouths, like we were animals.\u201d\nAnother detainee, Carlos Lopez Benitez, said he fled violence in Paraguay in 2023 and was seeking asylum in the U.S. when he was arrested in July while leaving an immigration hearing. He said officers told him he\u2019d be in detention until a 2029 hearing on his asylum application.\nLopez Benitez said an officer showed him a cellphone photo of his arrest and mocked him for crying. In his holding cell, he said, officers blasted air conditioning and doled out meals that \u201clooked like dog food.\u201d"

The company said Friday that it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.\nThe goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.\nTarget has long been a fierce corporate advocate for the rights of Black and LGBTQ+ people. In a memo to employees, Kiera Fernandez, Target\u2019s chief community impact and equity officer, described the DEI decisions as a \u201cnext chapter\u201d in the company\u2019s decades-long process to create \u201cinclusive work and guest environments that welcome all.\u201d\n\u201cMany years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,\u201d Fernandez wrote in the memo, which Target shared Friday. \u201cAnd as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no doubt the U.S. civil rights landscape has undergone a massive transformation in the five years since much of corporate America adopted DEI goals in response to the Black Lives Matter protests that followed Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis.\nA 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions emboldened conservative groups to bring or threaten lawsuits targeting corporate initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.\nWalmart, McDonald\u2019s, Ford, Harley-Davison and John Deere are among the well-known consumer brands that reduced or phased out their DEI commitments in recent months.\nPresident Donald Trump this week signaled his administration\u2019s agreement with conservatives who argue that policies designed to increase minority representation by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation are unconstitutional.\nOn his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending DEI programs across the federal government. The order calls for revoking all DEI mandates, policies, preferences and activities, along with the review and revision of existing employment practices, union contracts, and training policies or programs.\nStill, some prominent companies have resisted public pressure to retreat from their diversity plans. On Thursday, Costco shareholders rejected a proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion practices.\nAccording to preliminary results shared by Costco executives, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal submitted by a conservative think tank based in Washington. Costco\u2019s board of directors had recommended a no vote.\nApple\u2019s board and the CEO of JPMorgan bank also have expressed a commitment to preserving their companies\u2019 DEI activities.\nUnlike some of the companies retooling or retiring their diversity initiatives, Target\u2019s work to build a more inclusive workforce predated 2020, and the company also was long seen as a trailblazer with respect to LGBTQ+ inclusion.\nBut the employee memo shared Friday said Target no longer would participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they\u2019re connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.\nGetting corporations to withdraw from the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality Index and to stop sponsoring Pride activities have been goals of DEI opponents.\nSteering clear of a backlash from conservative customers and organizations is something that Target has tried to navigate for a while. As transgender rights became a more prominent issue in 2016, the company declared that \u201cinclusivity is a core belief at Target\u201d and said it supported transgender employees and customers using whichever restroom or fitting room \u201ccorresponds with their gender identity.\u201d\nBut after some customers threatened to boycott Target stores, the company said that more stores would make available a single-toilet bathroom with a door that could be locked.\nIn 2023, Target removed some of its Pride Month merchandise after online complaints and in-store confrontations that the retailer said threatened employees\u2019 well-being. The company decided last year not to stock Pride Month products at every U.S. store."

      "text": "Pentagon agency pauses celebrations for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Black History Month and more\nPentagon agency pauses celebrations for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Black History Month and more\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Defense Department\u2019s intelligence agency has paused observances of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Pride Month, Holocaust Days of Remembrance and other cultural or historical annual events in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal workplace.\nThe instructions were published Tuesday in a Defense Intelligence Agency memo obtained by The Associated Press and affect 11 annual events, including Black History Month, which begins Saturday, and National Hispanic Heritage Month.\nThe memo\u2019s authenticity was confirmed by a U.S. official who said the pause was initiated by the DIA and appears not to be policy across the Defense Department. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.\n\u201cWe are receiving questions across the workforce on the way forward,\u201d the memo said. \u201cDIA will pause all activities and events related to Agency Special Emphasis Programs effective immediately and until further notice.\u201d\nIt also noted a pause on \u201cspecial observances\u201d hosted throughout the year. While Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth were included, the memo said the change would not affect those national holidays.\nThe contents of the memo were first reported by independent journalist Ken Klippenstein and posted to X.\nFederal agencies have struggled to interpret Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 executive order ending DEI programs across the government and have taken a broad approach due to lack of clearer guidance from the White House on how to comply.\nOn Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed staff to create a DEI task force to ensure no DEI programs remain in the Pentagon.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not joking around,\u201d Hegseth said in an interview Wednesday with Fox News. \u201cThere\u2019s no changing of names or softly manipulating something. DEI is gone.\u201d\nIn response to a query from the AP about the memo, the DIA said late Wednesday it \u201cis working with the Department of Defense to fully implement all executive orders and administration guidance in a timely manner. As we receive additional guidance, we will continue to update our internal guidance.\u201d\nThe other annual events listed in the DIA memo are Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month, National American Indian Heritage Month, National Disability Employment Awareness Month, Women\u2019s Equality Day and Women\u2019s History Month.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked at a briefing Tuesday whether Black History Month would cease to be celebrated.\n\u201cAs far as I know, this White House certainly still intends to celebrate, and we will continue to celebrate American history and the contributions that all Americans, regardless of race, religion or creed, have made to our great country,\u201d she said.\nThe changes in holiday observances in some ways resemble the Air Force\u2019s quick elimination of DEI coursework in its basic military training, which temporarily resulted in the service removing videos on the Tuskegee Airmen and World War II female pilots that had been in those courses. After a brief uproar, the Air Force said the history of both groups would continue to be taught."

Trump has branded the programs \u201cdiscrimination\u201d and said he wants to restore \u201cmerit-based\u201d hiring.\nEverett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said the government already hires and promotes exclusively based on merit.\n\u201cThe results are clear: a diverse federal workforce that looks like the nation it serves, with the lowest gender and racial pay gaps in the country. We should all be proud of that,\u201d Kelley said in a statement.\nKelley called Trump\u2019s actions \u201ca smokescreen for firing civil servants, undermining the apolitical civil service, and turning the federal government into an army of yes-men loyal only to the president, not the Constitution.\u201d\nThe Trump order directs federal agencies to develop plans to deter DEI programs in the private sector and at universities and list potential civil compliance investigations that could be launched to bring about that aim. It\u2019s a marked attempt to chill DEI initiatives across the country, placing them in the crosshairs of the federal government such that even if conducted lawfully, private employers may be forced to respond to federal probes.\nShifting federal priorities between administrations of different political parties is nothing new. But the scale and speed of the country\u2019s onetime embrace of DEI programs and Trump\u2019s systematic effort to root them out is dizzying.\nAt the end of Trump\u2019s first term, the Republican sought to ban federal agency contractors and recipients of federal funds from carrying out corporate diversity initiatives.\nBiden rescinded that order on his first day as president and issued two executive orders aiming to stitch \u2014 throughout the government and the workforce at large \u2014 a sensitivity about bias and discrimination.\n\u201cI cannot describe to you how influential that executive order was. It really dictated the four years of the Biden administration,\u201d said Mike Gonzalez, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation whose writings have included a focus on DEI programs. \u201cThe first thing Trump does is rescind that executive order.\u201d\nGonzalez said the breadth of Trump\u2019s actions and the fact that they came so quickly was \u201ca pretty sweeping statement.\u201d\nGonzalez said DEI programs adopted across American society, from the federal government to private corporations, are \u201cdangerous, demeaning and immoral,\u201d and violate the Civil Rights Act and the 14th Amendment\u2019s guarantees of equal protection under the law.\nHe called Biden\u2019s actions on DEI \u201cvery misguided and regrettable.\u201d\n\u201cWe have gone down that path before as a society,\u201d he said. \u201cWe decided this was something we did not want to do, to promote or hire on the basis of race.\u201d\nMost Americans agree that being white and a man helps people\u2019s ability to get ahead in the U.S. today, and that being Black hurts people\u2019s ability to get ahead, according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted in 2023. They\u2019re also more likely to say that being a woman, Hispanic or Asian is more harmful than helpful.\nBut another Pew Research Center poll from 2024 found that U.S. adults are more split on the extent to which white people benefit from advantages that Black people don\u2019t have, or if women still face obstacles that make it harder for them to get ahead than men.\nAnd there are indications that Trump\u2019s supporters are particularly concerned about gains for groups like women and racial minorities coming at the expense of others. According to AP VoteCast, relatively few voters in the 2024 election overall \u2014 about 3 in 10 -- said they were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d concerned that U.S. society has focused too much on gains for women at the expense of men, but Trump\u2019s supporters were more divided. A majority were \u201cnot too\u201d concerned or \u201cnot at all\u201d concerned about gains for women coming at the expense of men, but about 4 in 10 said they were at least \u201csomewhat\u201d concerned.\nEven before Trump\u2019s actions, a backlash to DEI programs has been already underway in corporate America.\nDozens of prominent companies started to roll back, or even eliminate, their DEI commitments in the wake of a 2023 Supreme Court ruling eliminating affirmative action at universities, a decision that unleashed a flood of conservative-backed lawsuits against diversity efforts in the corporate world. The trend accelerated sharply after Trump\u2019s election as companies anticipated his aggressive orders to dismantle DEI.\nWalmart, for instance, announced in November that it would no longer consider race and gender when offering supplier contracts, a decision that mirrors reforms the Trump administration will pursue with federal contracts.\nAlready, conservative lawsuits have successfully forced some government agencies to stop considering race when awarding government contracting and financing.\nFacebook owner META, McDonald\u2019s and Boeing are among other companies that have dropped DEI commitments in response to the changing legal landscape and the change of government.\nHowever, many of the country\u2019s top companies have stuck by their DEI policies, including some with government contracts such as tech giant Microsoft and global consulting firm Accenture.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Amelia Thomson-Deveaux in Washington and Alexandra Olson in New York contributed to this report."

Al Sharpton, whose civil rights organization has encouraged consumers to avoid U.S. retailers that scaled backed their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\nSharpton called the meeting with Target CEO Brian Cornell \u201cvery constructive and candid,\u201d according to an update from his National Action Network. Two other NAN representatives, National Board Chair Dr. W. Franklyn Richardson and Senior Advisor Carra Wallace, also attended the meeting at the organization\u2019s New York headquarters.\n\u201cI am going to inform our allies, including Rev. Dr. Jamal Bryant, of our discussion, what my feelings are, and we will go from there,\u201d Sharpton said in a statement.\nBryant, an Atlanta area pastor, organized a website called targetfast.org to recruit Christians for a 40-day Target boycott. Other faith leaders endorsed the protest, which started with the beginning of Lent on March 5.\nA National Action Network spokesperson confirmed earlier Thursday that Sharpton, the group\u2019s founder and president, planned to meet Cornell in New York this week. The news was first reported by CNBC.\nA Target spokesperson couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.\nTarget is among a slew of companies, including Walmart, Amazon and PepsiCo, that have eliminated policies and programs aimed at bolstering diversity among their employees and reducing discrimination against members of minority groups, women and LGBTQ+ people.\nAfter returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump moved to end DEI programswithin the federal government. He has warned schools to do the same or risk losing federal money.\nThe National Action Network said Sharpton met on Tuesday with PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta and Steven Williams, the CEO of PepsiCo North America, to \u201cget clarity on its stance on DEI, whether they were shutting down their commitments due to pressure from Trump and right-wing activists, and the path moving forward.\u201d\nEarlier this month, Sharpton gave PepsiCo three weeks to meet with him \u2014 or suffer a boycott \u2014 to discuss reversing the company\u2019s recent move to do away with its DEI initiatives.\nThe National Action Network said Thursday that Sharpton planned to consult the organization\u2019s board members over the Easter holiday \u201cto determine any next steps with Target, PepsiCo, and other companies that have scaled back their DEI programs or pledges.\u201d\nTarget announced on Jan. 24 that it would conclude the DEI goals it had set to increase Black employees\u2019 representation and advancement, improve Black shoppers\u2019 experiences and promote Black-owned businesses. The company also said it planned to stop submitting reports for external diversity surveys.\nIt is also \u201cfurther evaluating our corporate partnerships to ensure they are directly connected to our roadmap for growth,\u201d according to a memo posted on its website.\nA number of other boycotts were launched of retailers that have pulled back on DEI."

  "argos_summary": "Rev. Al Sharpton is leading a Wall Street march to protest the Trump administration\u2019s push to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and to urge corporate America to resist boycotts of companies that have scaled back DEI initiatives. Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network has called for consumer boycotts of retailers such as Target, Walmart and Amazon, while Target has announced it will end its DEI goals and stop reporting on diversity metrics. The Trump administration has also ordered K\u201112 schools to certify compliance with federal civil\u2011rights laws or risk losing funding, and a federal judge has ordered improvements at a New York immigration holding facility after detainees complained of inhumane conditions. These actions reflect a broader federal effort to roll back DEI policies across government, education, and the private sector, sparking backlash from civil\u2011rights groups and corporate leaders who defend inclusive practices.",
