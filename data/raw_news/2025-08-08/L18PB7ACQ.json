  "description": "I took the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Oppo Find X8 Ultra on a trip to Sweden, but I'll pick only one of these phones for my next vacation.",
  "content": "\u2022 Oppo Find X8 Ultra performs better than its Samsung rival in almost every scenario.\n\u2022 The Galaxy S25 Ultra comes close in ultrawide camera comparison.\n\u2022 Oppo's flagship has unique features like XPAN mode, Hasselblad color science, and Master mode.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra houses one of the most versatile camera systems on a mainstream phone, thanks to its two telephoto cameras and an ultrawide sensor coupled with a 200MP primary camera.\n\nAlso: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. OnePlus 13: I compared the best Android phones, and it was very close\n\nBut the Oppo Find X8 Ultra is equally, if not more, versatile. It has bigger sensors on the four 50MP cameras on its back. Plus, the Oppo flagship is paired with a renewed Hasselblad partnership -- for extra features like XPAN mode, better Portraits, and Hasselblad Natural Color Solution, re-engineered for mobile.\n\nI was confused about which phone to take on my trip to Sweden, so I took both and compared the results, which are... interesting.\n\nOppo and Samsung flagships are some of the best phones of 2025. Both sport four rear cameras, but the Find X8 Ultra houses bigger sensors on three of those. It is led by a 1-inch-type 50MP main sensor, which snaps better quality photos than Samsung's 200MP primary camera.\n\nBut it's the rest of the sensors that help it take the lead. The 10MP 3x optical zoom Samsung telephoto camera stands no chance against Oppo's 50MP 3x optical zoom supported periscope camera, while it competes closely in ultrawide shots and 50MP secondary 5x (6x on Oppo) periscope zoom photos.\n\nAlso: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. OnePlus 13: I compared the best Android phones, and it was very close\n\nThere's no doubt that the Find X8 Ultra has a better camera package than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, thanks to its bigger sensors and Hasselblad color science. But it can also be inconsistent at times, giving the edge to Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra. Here's how the two compare in my vacation photos.\n\nIt's all about the color science\n\nThe Oppo Find X8 Ultra exposes the subjects better in most scenarios. It tends to brighten the subject in harsh lighting conditions, making them look (almost) artificial, but I'd still prefer it over Samsung's under-exposed shots. For example, in the above shots, my face looks better exposed in the left image than in Samsung's 3x portrait. Samsung has a warmer undertone, while Oppo's shot looks more lively.\n\nOppo can overdo the processing at times. Neither of the above shots is perfect, but I would pick the Galaxy S25 Ultra photo because it doesn't look artificial.\n\nAlso: Own a OnePlus phone? I changed 10 settings to significantly improve the user experience\n\nWhile underexposed, it retains my skin tone and looks more real, whereas Oppo blows out the highlights to an extent. It is one of those inconsistent processing scenarios that happen once in a while, but it can ruin the vibe of the photo if you haven't snapped a backup shot.\n\nThe inconsistent processing is limited only to harsh lighting conditions. Otherwise, Oppo's Find X8 Ultra beats the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra in every scenario. It consistently shoots better-looking shots in low light. Notice the bulbs on this lamp; Samsung couldn't get the details, and the overall shot has more noise, while Oppo's image is sharper.\n\nThis story continues on their respective periscope zoom cameras. Oppo's 6x zoom captures more details, natural bokeh, and no noise, even in low light. Samsung's shot looks dull despite snapping a significant amount of details, while Oppo's colors pop compared to the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\n\nSamsung competes better in ultrawide images. Both phones process saturated colors with plenty of details for a low-light shot. Outdoors, the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Oppo Find X8 Ultra capture equally good-looking shots, but Oppo's lively-looking color science appeals more to me.\n\nI would pick the Oppo Find X8 Ultra over the Galaxy S25 Ultra for portrait shots any day. Even at 6x, the portrait shots look fantastic, thanks to Hasselblad color science. In bright lighting conditions, it processes a natural-looking bokeh and adapts to the tone of its surroundings.\n\nFor example, the above two photos were taken near the sea, so they have a cooler tone, but a portrait taken during sunset will have a warmer tone.\n\nTo compare, Samsung's shot looks less lively and tends to have aggressive blur around the edges of the subject, which makes a portrait shot look unnatural. While it retains the color of my shirt better, Oppo's photo delivers the vibe of the place with its warmer tone in direct sunlight.\n\nAlso: Samsung is giving these Galaxy phones a big One UI upgrade - here's which models qualify\n\nThere are multiple things -- like 6x tele macro and XPAN mode -- that you'll only find on the Oppo Find X8 Ultra. For the unaware, XPAN mode is available on OnePlus and Oppo flagship phones. It is inspired by Hasselblad's XPan feature, which allows you to capture panoramic shots in a unique 65:24 aspect ratio.\n\nI love it because how else would I be able to snap artistic ceilings in castles or panoramic-like views in scenic places? Definitely not with a regular panorama mode.\n\nSamsung gets a lot of things right, like not adding a Camera Control-like button, which hinders the landscape shooting experience on my Oppo phone. However, the South Korean giant needs to work on tuning the color science if it wants to challenge the likes of Oppo Find X8 Ultra. For now, I would happily pick the Oppo flagship over a Galaxy S25 Ultra for its Hasselblad colors, better portraits, Master mode, and XPAN mode.\n\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter.",

TCL's Nxtpaper technology offers a paper-like screen that's made for tired eyes like mine. The TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G is the company's affordable attempt at relieving some of the stress that comes from modern smartphone screens.\nAlso: Changing this Android setting instantly doubled my phone speed (Samsung and Google models included)\nIt's a unique trick for a very inexpensive smartphone that needs to be seen to be understood. While far from perfect, and definitely a device built to a price, it brings a differentiator that will matter for some users looking to give their eyes a rest while they scroll or read.\nA unique multi-faceted display\nThe display is what immediately sets the 60XE apart. TCL's Nxtpaper 3.0 matte coating gives the glass an undeniably unique finish that I quite like. On-screen content looks a bit like E-ink depending on the mode the phone is in, but underneath that hazy layer is a standard 1080p, 120Hz LCD panel.\nThe coating addresses a slew of common downsides of modern displays. It reduces blue light, cuts reflections to nearly nothing, and even eliminates most fingerprints. There's also a nice texture that feels a bit like paper, which is a nice departure from a sea of glossy, reflective displays.\nBeneath the power and volume buttons is a physical Nxtpaper Key, a plastic switch that feels a bit cheaper than I'd like. Flipping the switch offers up a menu of distinct modes that change how the display operates.\nTCL clearly wants users to notice and appreciate this feature because every toggle results in a five-second full-screen animation complete with an obnoxious serenade. I made sure to set my volume to mute so I could avoid the theatrical effect.\nEach mode provides its own twist on usability and comfort. Color Paper Mode, my favorite, mutes the colors while retaining a standard Android interface that's easier on the eyes for all-day use. I even enjoyed watching YouTube videos in this mode, though everything feels a bit flatter than my eyes are used to.\nInk Paper Mode goes one step further, stripping color from icons and text for a no-frills grayscale approach, while still delivering the full unencumbered Android experience. Max Ink Mode is the most dramatic change, stripping all color while also limiting apps to a small subset of essentials and suspending certain background processes.\nAlso: iOS 26 envy? 5 iPhone features you can already use on your Android (Samsung included)\nThe result is an ultra-minimal, battery-saving mode that can last more than a week on a single charge. I enjoyed this mode for reading ebooks and could see it as a great solution for users looking to cut back on smartphone use entirely.\nThe display does come with a major caveat. On the brightest days, the matte finish would all but wash out on-screen content, often making it unusable in direct sunlight. If you spend time outside reading or working, you'll be looking for shade like I was.\nPerformance and battery\nPerformance is modest but serviceable, with a MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ processor inside paired with 8GB of RAM. In use, this is not a phone for hardcore users who push their devices to the limit. I noticed many actions have a slight delay attached to them. Launching the camera often takes a few seconds to negotiate.\nGeneral tasks like web browsing, email, and messaging are responsive enough to keep me happy, but things never felt snappy.\nOn the software front, the 60 XE runs Android 15, with a promise from TCL of just one upgrade to Android 16 and two years of security patches. As someone who always decries the poor state of Android OS update promises, this is a weak point, and TCL needs to step up its game. Anyone hoping to get long-term value should consider other options.\nAlso: I spent a week in New York City with the Samsung Z Fold 7 - and it spoiled me the entire time\nI found battery life to be a highlight, which isn't that surprising given the 5,010mAh battery hidden inside. I routinely made it through the day with around 20-30% capacity to spare at bedtime. Wired charging tops out at a slow 18 watts, so quick daytime top-ups will take some time, but it's fine for plugging in overnight.\nFor the truly battery paranoid, there's the Max Ink Mode that considerably jumps battery life to more than a week if you are willing to cut down on much of what the phone is capable of.\nStay for the display, but not the camera\nThe plastic marble-like backplate surrounds a large circular camera array that's hard to miss and perhaps even more premium-looking than its price point. One pet peeve of mine is an off-center camera module, and this phone has a notable wobble when placed on a tabletop as a result.\nThe camera system itself is one area where the low-end cutbacks really show. The main sensor does its best outdoors in very bright conditions and needs a lot of light to help shots taken indoors. The camera performance is mediocre with soft output that lacks punch and definition most of the time.\nLow-light conditions easily demonstrate the camera system's baseline capability, and the ultrawide lens often results in grainy images. The 32MP front camera works, but that's about it. Let's just say that this is not the phone for the discerning camera buff.\nZDNET's buying advice\nWhat the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G offers is a key standout feature: a unique matte display. At $250, the 60XE offers something that you really can't find anywhere else, in this price category and beyond, and the benefits of that might matter a lot for certain users. For everyone else, consider phones like the CMF Phone 2 Pro, which offers better imaging, better speed, and its signature modular design approach.\nFollow my latest tech reviews and projects across social media.

I'm pretty familiar with the Stealth line, having reviewed several models in the past. This version doesn't reinvent the wheel. In fact, it shares many similarities with its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI+, to its benefit and to a fault.\nAlso: The best laptops for graphic designers: Expert tested\nFirst off: on the surface, I genuinely can't tell the difference between this model and the previous generation. The Stealth 16 measures 14\"x 10.22\"x 0.85\" inches -- the exact same dimensions as the A16. It even weighs the same at 4.63 pounds.\nWhat's funny is I used to think that was really heavy, but after carrying around chunky laptops, MSI's device feels lightweight. Even with the power adapter, I didn't mind carrying it around town. By the way, I factor that adapter into the overall weight because you will need it on hand. More on that later.\nBringing back the classics\nA few other great design elements make their triumphant return. Going down the list, you have a full-size gaming keyboard. Each button has a 1.5mm travel distance, ensuring a comfortable typing feel. Six surround sound speakers are located at either end below the keyboard for immersive audio.\nOne of my favorite moments testing this laptop came from listening to \"Doomsday\" by MF Doom. The lyrical flow from Doom sounded crystal clear and powerful through the laptop's speakers, filling my entire room with his supervillainy.\nAbove the keyboard is the 16-inch OLED display. At QuadHD+ (2,560 x 1,600 pixels) resolution, it's not quite 4K, but it's close enough -- the screen still delivers impressive visual output. Colors are vibrant, the high resolution delivers detailed images, and the 240Hz refresh rate ensures smooth on-screen motion.\nPower boost\nOne of my favorite things about MSI laptops is how easy it is to tweak their performance. On many Windows 11 laptops, all you can really do is change the Power mode in the Settings, but MSI Center, its internal settings program is actually pretty robust. Here, you can adjust the computer's output on the fly. For example, enabling Extreme Performance and Discrete Graphics Mode delivers the best hardware results.\nAlso: I tested Dell's XPS successor, and it beat my $3,000 Windows laptop in almost every way\nInside my review unit was an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card, and 32GB of RAM. It's a pretty good configuration, if I say so myself, and it shows in the performance numbers.\nBelow is a list comparing MSI's Stealth 16 with its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI Plus, and the Dell Premium 16. You'll notice that the newer model has better raw processing and rendering power than the others, indicating it excels at handling heavy workloads and rendering complex 3D graphics.\nThere is a bit of a gap between the Stealth 16 and the A16 on PCMark 10, suggesting that the older model has better general performance; it's able to hop between web pages and apps without much issue. However, I didn't experience any slowdown. This laptop ran great everywhere.\nPCMark 10 | Geekbench 6 | Cinebench 2024 | Cinebench R23 | |\nMSI Stealth 16 AI | 7,693 | 15,883 | 1,129 | 21,656 |\nMSI Stealth A16 AI+ | 7,913 | 14,196 | N/A | 18,336 |\nDell Premium 16 | 6,865 | 14,763 | 726 | 17,522 |\nHaving Dell's machine may seem random, but you need to understand that the Stealth 16 isn't just a solid gaming computer. It's also a powerful graphic design laptop, too. For testing, I installed Blender, a free 3D creation app, and edited images on Pixlr. I'm not much of an artist, but I did manage to create and render simple scenes starring Blender's complex monkey model.\nI had a similar experience with Pixlr, as I was able to edit 4K photographs without any major hiccups. The entire process went smoothly. MSI's laptop is a powerhouse in almost every sense of the word.\nAlso: I switched to the Dell 14 Premium for a week, and it makes even the XPS feel outdated\nAs powerful as the laptop may be, it has its limits. I ran multiple 4K YouTube livestreams as part of my usual 50-tab Chrome browser test. Everything ran fine when there were only three livestreams, although once I hit six, I noticed a slowdown. Livestreams were slow to load. It took a few seconds before the Stealth 16 could play the video as normal.\nStaying cool\nHeavy workloads do cause the Stealth 16 to heat up a bit, but high temperatures were never an issue. Heat vents are strategically placed above the keyboard, on the side of the laptop, and on the bottom, so your hands are never at risk of touching a hot keyboard. In fact, the keys stayed nice and cool the entire time. Unfortunately, this means you can't place the computer on your lap; otherwise, your legs will be blasted by hot air.\nThis ability to stay cool under duress is thanks to the Cooler Boost 5 cooling system, which consists of two large fans and five heat pipes directing hot air out through the vents. This system is also on the vastly more powerful MSI Raider 18 HX.\nUnsurprisingly, MSI's Stealth 16 is not designed to be away from its charger for long. You can push its endurance by enabling ECO-Silent and Integrated Graphics Mode in the MSI Center app, and Best Power Efficiency in Windows, but even then, it will last around six hours on a single charge, depending on what you're doing.\nLike many gaming laptops with this kind of hardware, it may have power, but it lacks in stamina. For that reason, I'd suggest this for users who don't need an all-day battery kind of laptop, but are fine with a few hour stints throughout the day.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe MSI Stealth 16 AI is on sale at Best Buy for $2,030, which is a good price for a laptop with this kind of hardware. I recommend this device to anyone looking for an affordable gaming laptop that can also be used as a work machine. If you like this laptop but want to save some cash, its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI+, is very similar and still relevant in 2025, retailing for $1,800.\nIf you want a more powerful graphic design computer, I suggest the Alienware 18 Area-51. It is a much more powerful gaming laptop that leaves every laptop I mentioned so far in the dust. I think it's one of the best for the year. It is, however, very expensive; my review unit cost $3,200."

The 512GB S25 Ultra is also on sale and can be bought for as low as $1,299.\nSamsung's Big Bad Galaxy phone is here, and it may be the least surprising device I've tested so far. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, which starts at the same bold price as last year, $1,299, remains the company's do-everything handset. This premium Android phone is now Samsung's best phone overall, with a more durable display, an upgraded camera lens with some handy editing tricks, and the latest Qualcomm processor keeping things running. Oh, and yes, AI is everything, everywhere, all at once.\nAlso: I changed 10 Samsung phone settings to give it a significant performance boost\nWhile last year's Galaxy S24 series ushered in Samsung's Galaxy AI era, this year feels more like the company cementing itself as the leader in the smartphone space, besting Apple and even Google (for now) on features and capabilities. How decorative that honor is ultimately depends on how invested you are in using AI.\nI've spent a month testing the S25 Ultra and wasn't too surprised to find myself both fascinated and bored. After all, this is now Samsung's fifth iteration of the S-series Ultra model, and the changes year-over-year have been modest, to be generous. But if you're currently using a three- to four-year-old handset and considering an upgrade, take this first-hand testimonial to heart. (And if you're an enthusiast, it'll matter just as much to you.)\nThe Galaxy S Ultra has always been a big-phone, two-handed affair, and that holds this year. When I first unboxed the S25 Ultra, it felt like the fanciest calculator ever (and I mean that in a nice way), with its round edges and tall stature. Coming from the OnePlus 13 I reviewed back in January -- which, on paper, is relatively similar in size -- the S25 Ultra had a bolder and more striking presence.\nFortunately, the device is not as top-heavy as I remember previous models being, even though Samsung encased the four rear cameras with thicker rings this time around. In fact, the S25 Ultra is lighter than its predecessor by 16 grams, earning it the title of the thinnest Galaxy S Ultra ever. You should still opt for the slimmer S25 and S25 Plus if that's the form factor you're after, and you'll likely hear more about the \"thinnification\" of phones later this year. Furthermore, if small phones are your style, refer to our roundup of the best small phones of 2025.\nAlso: This midrange Galaxy phone can make you forget ever wanting a flagship - and it's on sale\nThe other notable design upgrade with the S25 Ultra is the Corning Gorilla Armor 2 layered over the front display. It doesn't take away from the anti-reflection surface treatment that made headlines on last year's S24 Ultra, yet promises improved drop protection and scratch resistance. I believe it. My S24 Ultra last year had numerous micro scratches after just days of testing, while my S25 Ultra review unit has remained pristine so far -- even after I removed the privacy screen protector I initially installed on it.\nNow, if only Samsung could bring back the glory days of psychedelic Aura Glow finishes because these S25 Ultra colors are uninspiring. Perhaps it's the nature of titanium finishes or the harsh reality that consumers are more likely to opt for safer colors with black, white, and silver hues than poppy and bright. Regardless, you'll want to slap on a case to give your S25 Ultra even a touch of personality.\nUnder the hood is a new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip for Galaxy, which is an overclocked variant of the processor powering competing Android phones in 2025 like the OnePlus 13 and Honor Magic 7 Pro. The most notable benefit of the chipset comes in the form of AI experiences -- specifically, a 40% increase in NPU performance compared to last year's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.\nAlso: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. OnePlus 13: I compared the best Android phones, and it was very close\nIn layman's terms, on-device AI features should take up less bandwidth and power to operate while also functioning quickly. I saw the results in person, placebo effect or not, as my S25 Ultra can swiftly remove subjects (along with their shadows) from the background of photos via Generative Edit and pull up Gemini search results in a matter of seconds. I ran a couple of response tests with the iPhone 16 Pro (running Siri and ChatGPT) and Google Pixel 9 Pro (running Gemini), and the Galaxy S25 Ultra was the clear front-runner.\nYou can also credit the performance to the enhanced Gemini app, which can now be fired up with a long press of the power button. Previously, Samsung phones were limited to Bixby -- or Google Assistant, if you made some sketchy backend modifications -- so this change is a breath of fresh air. It makes transitioning from any other Android phone with Gemini as the default assistant much more burdenless.\nSpeaking of which, the new Gemini-Bixby hybrid AI agent, as Samsung confusingly presents it, can handle natural-sounding, conversational chains of actions, such as looking up the upcoming schedule of your favorite sports team and adding the date(s) to your calendar. While the agent-like capability mainly works across Google and Samsung apps, some third-party services like Spotify are supported, too.\nAlso: Samsung is giving these Galaxy phones a big One UI upgrade - here's which models qualify\nThe important thing is knowing how to phrase your commands. For example, when I asked the AI agent to create a Spotify playlist for road trips and send it to my wife, it responded that it was unable to do so. When, instead, I asked it to find songs that were good for road trips, it curated the list and drafted a modifiable text message. My AI advice: if a prompt doesn't work, try and try again.\nConsidering the Galaxy S24 series introduced Google's Circle to Search feature, and the S25 series is doing the same for the enhanced Gemini-Bixby experience, it wouldn't be farfetched to say that Samsung, not Google, makes the best AI phone on the market right now.\nSome other new Galaxy AI tools, like AI Select and Now Brief, only reinforce that statement. The former is an adaptive, context-aware screen selection tool, and the latter gives daily summaries of the weather, calendar events, and news.\nAlso: Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge hands-on: This ultra-thin phone made my iPhone feel outdated\nI just wish Now Brief showed me more than just political news; even after two weeks since setting my topic preferences within my Samsung News app to technology and sports, the app still treats my mornings with the generic \"Uplifting Morning Prep\" Spotify playlist and latest scoop on the US president signing executive orders.\nOne of the key reasons to buy a Galaxy Ultra phone continues to be the camera, though Samsung hasn't improved the specifications much this year -- at least on paper. The only hardware change is the 50-megapixel ultrawide lens (up from 12MP), which, from my two weeks' worth of shots, yields greater detail and vividness, especially when capturing macro photos.\nThe rest of the lenses, such as the 200MP wide, 50MP 5x telephoto, and 10MP 3x telephoto, are identical to last year's S24 Ultra, but several internal contributors like the improved ISP of the Qualcomm chip have made the S25 Ultra's output more true to real life, especially when it comes to face tones and details in low light.\nAlso: The best Samsung phones to buy in 2025\nThere's a bigger focus on the software side of things, with Samsung introducing helpful photo and video features like 10-bit HDR video recording by default to capture a wider dynamic range, a new Audio Eraser feature that lets you adjust the volumes of various frequencies (classified as audio subjects like voices, wind, and noises), and the ability to record in Galaxy Log mode.\nThe latter feature allows you to spot overexposed areas better and adjust the dynamic range while recording videos. It also allows you to apply LUTs in post for better color and light control.\nZDNET's buying advice\nMy month of testing the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra confirms several things for me. While most aspects of the phone, such as the vibrant, glare-free display and versatility across the cameras and AI features, are easy to appreciate, the upgrades this year feel iterative and safe.\nIn ways, Samsung has even taken a few steps back, with the S Pen stylus no longer supporting Bluetooth controls and gestures, and the company opting for Qi2-ready cases instead of embedding the actual technology within its phones. Samsung may reason the absence of magnets with added weight and bulk, but it's inexcusable when Apple continues to make the iPhone slimmer while offering similar functionality.\nAlso: I've tested every Samsung Galaxy S25 model - and my favorite isn't the Ultra\nIt's understandable that early adopters and tech enthusiasts might feel underwhelmed by the S25 Ultra; when you brand your phone as \"Ultra,\" it should, theoretically, lead the market in multiple aspects. In today's landscape, however, Samsung needs to give us a bit more than just a new chip and some software features. Otherwise, it's becoming harder and harder for me to justify spending $1,300 on a phone.\nBut for consumers who are coming from an S21 series, Pixel 6 or 7, or even an older iPhone, Samsung's new flagship handset checks almost every box. Just make sure to survey your local carrier or retailer for a generous trade-in deal before you make the investment.\nWhen will this deal expire?\nIt's unknown exactly how long this deal will last as an expiration date wasn't given, but don't expect it to last for very long.

I changed 10 settings to significantly improve the user experience\nIt's been agreed upon by the ZDNET team that the OnePlus 13 is this year's sleeper hit. At a starting price of $899, the flagship phone can compete against more expensive phones like the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. And we have OnePlus' clean yet highly customizable software experience to thank for that.\nAlso: The next big wireless charging leap is coming soon: What Qi2 25W means for Android phones\nIf you switched to a OnePlus phone recently or have been using one since its startup days, there's a good chance you aren't using the phone to its full potential. In fact, over the years, OxygenOS, which has since been converted to ColorOS, has received numerous updates that make the phones more productive and easy to use.\nHere are 10 of them that I recommend enabling or changing to achieve the most intuitive user experience.\n1. Enable Fingerprint Quick Launch\nOnePlus phones have a feature that lets you launch apps from the lock screen with just a press-and-swipe. With Fingerprint Quick Launch, you can add up to five apps or actions to launch without needing to lift your finger after unlocking the phone.\nFor instance, I've added Gmail, Chrome, Video and Portrait on my OnePlus 13. I can place my finger and swipe it towards the app/action that I want to launch. It comes in handy when I need to record a quick video or hear my Gmail ping for an important email. You can enable it by going to Settings > Security and Privacy > Finger and Face Unlock > Fingerprint > Quick Launch.\n2. Use the Smart Sidebar to your advantage\nSamsung introduced a sidebar-like feature on the Galaxy Note Edge, and it has evolved since to be more customizable and useful. On OnePlus phones, the Smart Sidebar is a small area on the right edge (customizable) that you can access with a swipe. It is useful for quickly accessing your most-used tools (like voice recorder or screen recorder) and apps. You can enable/disable it by going to Settings > Accessibility and Convenience > Smart Sidebar.\nAlso: OnePlus phones are losing one of their most unique features - and it might actually be good news\nThe Smart Sidebar is also useful as a productive feature. You can drag and drop items to the File Dock, which can be accessed anytime in the future. I frequently use it to drag items from Instagram or Chrome and drop them into WhatsApp chats. To enable File Dock, you need to go to Settings > Accessibility and Convenience > Smart Sidebar > Toggle on File Dock. You can further adjust the Smart Sidebar position, functions, and more.\n3. Use XPAN mode for landscapes\nXPAN is one of the most underrated camera features, in my opinion. I first used it on the Oppo Find N2 Flip to capture Costa Brava scenery, and I'm glad it has made its way to OnePlus phones. It is inspired by Hasselblad's XPan feature, which allows you to capture panoramic shots in a unique 65:24 aspect ratio.\nOnePlus first added the XPAN Mode on OnePlus 9 series but it hasn't gained traction because for the longest time, it didn't allow users to add XPAN to their Viewfinder. As a result, it was hidden under More in the Camera app. You can add it and use it by going to Camera > More > tap and hold XPAN > and then adding it to the viewfinder.\n4. Enable Live Photos\nEarlier last year, I wrote about how much I like Live Photos on my iPhone, and more Android phones should have this feature. To my pleasant surprise, almost every 2025 smartphone now has a Live Photo or similar feature, which captures a 3-second video when you click a photo. I love it because it tends to capture the emotions behind a photo.\nAlso: The best Android phones to buy in 2025\nIt comes in especially handy when I'm snapping photos of my parents. They can never get both of their eyes open in a shot at once. It takes a few tries, and in the meantime, Live Photo captures short and funny behind-the-scenes footage. To enable Live Photos on a OnePlus phone, go to Camera and tap on the third icon on the top row.\n5. AI Edits to improve your photos\nRecent OnePlus phones have a lot of AI features that can be useful in certain situations. One of my favorite AI features on the OnePlus 13 is AI Reflection Eraser. It resides in the Photos app and can be used to erase mirror reflections in your images.\nAI Eraser and AI Unblur are two other features that come in handy when there's an unwanted subject in the background or when I capture a photo, but it turns out to be blurry. To use these features, you need to go to the photo you want to edit > tap on Edit > AI Editor.\n6. Change the display resolution\nIf you have a flagship OnePlus phone, like the OnePlus 13, make sure you're using the display at its highest resolution. After all, you paid for QHD+. Most phones that support QHD resolution don't have it enabled by default.\nAlso: Is Apple's iOS 26 rebranding a gimmick or pure genius? My verdict as an iPhone and Mac user\nI recommend changing it to the sharpest resolution available because OnePlus phones have reliable battery life, and a sharp screen won't hurt it. This will let you interact with a sharper and more pleasing display. To enable QHD+, go to Settings > Display & brightness > Screen resolution > High.\n7. Add Quick Search shortcut\nOnePlus recently added a global search to its phones, allowing you to search for contacts, settings, files, and more by simply writing their names in the Quick Search box. There are multiple ways to access it, and one of them is a swipe-down gesture on the home screen. If you're coming from an iPhone, this might be your go-to gesture.\nHowever, for those who have used an Android and prefer having Notifications and Quick Settings on a swipe down on the home screen, you shouldn't have to miss out on Quick Search. You can add it to your home screen above the home screen apps to still have it at your fingertips. I recommend doing so because over time, you'll notice yourself using Quick Search frequently.\nTo add Quick Search to the home screen, go to Settings > Home screen & Lock screen > Toggle on Show search at the bottom.\n8. Customize Always on Display\nOnePlus offers several customization options for Always on Display (AOD) to help personalize your phone better. You can add a black-and-white image sketch with Canvas, a Bitmoji, or simply an image and text. Moreover, you can choose what you want to see on your AoD\u2013it goes further than simply choosing notification icons.\nAlso: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. OnePlus 13: I compared the best Android phones, and it was very close\nYou can choose to display the usual information like Time, Date, Battery, and Notifications, as well as Contextual info from Live Alerts and music playback. I have it enabled for my food delivery apps, Swiggy and Zomato, so I can see when my order will be delivered at a glance. I hope Uber extends support for this feature because I'd love to see the ETA for my driver without needing to unlock my phone.\nFurthermore, you can adjust the clock style, change to informational AoDs like Insight and Carbon footprint, and more. You'll find all these options under Settings > Wallpapers & styles > Always On Display.\n9. Double tap to turn the screen on/off\nYou will not realize how useful this feature is until you use it. When on the home screen, you can double-tap to lock your phone. This is useful when your phone is lying unlocked on a table and you want to lock it, but pressing the power button isn't the most convenient option.\nSimilarly, if you don't like AoD but still need information at a glance, double-tap to wake your phone is a good option. To enable, go to Settings > Home screen & Lock screen and toggle on these two options:\n- Double tap to lock\n- Double tap to turn the screen on/off\nBonus: Enable these OnePlus gestures and settings\nThere are multiple shortcuts that I miss when I move from a OnePlus phone to review another phone. These include -\nIcon pull-down: OnePlus allows you to make its big-screen phones more manageable by swiping from the bottom left or right to pull down the screen. Go to Settings > Home screen & Lock screen > Icon pull-down gesture > Toggle on Icon pull-down gesture.\nRaise to wake: If you want your phone screen to turn on as soon as you pick it up, you should turn on Raise to wake by going to Go to Settings > Home screen & Lock screen > Toggle on Raise to wake.\nLive Alerts: Like Live Activities on iPhone, OnePlus has a Live Alerts feature that shows glanceable information from certain apps without needing to open them. Go to Settings > Notification & Quick Settings > Live Alerts > turn it on/off for the apps you need.\nPocket mistouch prevention: There are times when you put your phone in your pocket without turning off the screen. Butt dial is a most famous example of pocket mistouch. To prevent it from happening, enable this feature by going to Settings > Home screen & Lock screen > Toggle on Pocket mistouch prevention.\nQuick Settings classic view: If you're used to the default Quick Settings view, the recent Android 15 updates across manufacturers could be annoying because it splits Quick Settings (swipe down from the right side) and Notifications (swipe down from the left side) like iOS. While OnePlus makes you choose between Split and Classic when setting up the phone, you can change your style by going to Settings > Notification & Quick Settings > Quick Settings > Classic."

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. OnePlus 13: I compared the best Android phones, and it was very close\nIt's only March, but it feels like we've already seen the best Android phones of 2025. With the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and OnePlus 13, you're looking at two of the most complete handsets on the market right now, with both devices featuring the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, enough RAM to power various AI tools, and other key advances that we'll likely see and hear more of later this year.\nAlso: Best of MWC 2025: 10 most impressive products that you might've missed\nEven so, the latest from Samsung and OnePlus aren't perfect, and their most notable shortcomings are the reason why this comparison exists in the first place. To help you decide which of the two devices to upgrade, you'll want to consider factors like software experience, battery and charging, and the features that make each unique. I break down the list of key buying reasons below.\nSpecifications\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | OnePlus 13 | |\nDisplay | 6.9-inch QHD LTPO AMOLED with 120Hz | 6.82-inch QHD LTPO OLED with 120Hz |\nProcessor | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite |\n| RAM/Storage | 12GB RAM with 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 16GB with 256GB, 512GB |\n| Battery | 5,000mAh with 45W wired and 15W wireless charging | 6,000mAh with 80W wired and 50W wireless charging |\n| Camera | 200MP main, 50MP ultrawide, 50MP telephoto (5x), 10MP telephoto (3x), 12MP selfie | 50MP main, 50MP ultrawide, 50MP telephoto (3x), 32MP selfie |\n| Durability | IP68 with Corning Gorilla Armor 2 | IP69 with Crystal Shield super-ceramic glass |\n| Weight | 218 grams | 210 - 213 grams (depending on color) |\n| Price | Starting at $1,299 | Starting at $899 |\nYou should buy the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra if...\n1. You want the more capable camera system\nWhile the S25 Ultra doesn't necessarily push the envelope this year with its upgraded camera system, it's still one of, if not the most versatile options on the market. You're getting a 200-megapixel wide lens that pulls in more detail than most phones, the same 50MP and 10MP telephoto lenses from last year's S24 Ultra, and a new 50MP ultrawide that, from our testing, can capture crisp and sharp-looking landscape and macro photos. (With close-up shots, you just have to be extra patient as the phone adjusts its focus.)\nAlso: I used the Galaxy S25 Ultra as my daily driver for two weeks - and I'm worried for Samsung\nThe larger camera enhancements with the S25 Ultra come in the form of software, from computing photo details to editing subjects with generative AI tools. For example, there's a new Audio Eraser feature that lets you adjust the volume of various sound profiles in videos (both newly and previously recorded ones). The ability to capture footage in Galaxy Log mode also means that creatives and video professionals have better control of lighting, contrast levels, and overall colors when editing.\n2. You want the best of AI experiences right now\nIf you told me years ago that Google Pixel users are considering switching to Samsung because of software, I would've thought you were crazy. But here we are, with the S25 Ultra taking the lead this year in AI capabilities and updates, and Google is helping to add fuel to the tank. The newest Galaxy phones feature a swath of AI features, but the standout for me is cross-app integrations with Gemini.\nBy linking services from Samsung, Google, and other third-party applications, users can now ask Gemini to fulfill a chain of tasks with a single command. For example, you can long-press the power button -- which can be configured to activate Gemini instead of Bixby now -- and ask the assistant to search for a local Mexican restaurant that's pet-friendly and send the address to a contact. Such a feature is currently exclusive to the Samsung Galaxy S25 series and Google Pixel 9 series.\n3. The Samsung-exclusive benefits entice you\nBuying a flagship Samsung phone entitles you to several benefits, including a longer-than-average software update policy -- with the S25 Ultra supporting up to seven years of OS and security patches, wider access to repair services and parts, and more options for cases, screen protectors, and other third-party accessories.\nAlso: I'm skipping the Plus and Ultra - here's why the standard Galaxy S25 is my top pick\nWith the Galaxy S Ultra model in particular, there's the benefit of having a built-in S Pen stylus, which gives you precision inputs for notetaking, sketching, and other creative tasks. Just know that this year's S Pen no longer has a rechargeable battery and, therefore, loses the ability to control the phone wirelessly.\nYou should buy the OnePlus 13 if...\n1. You want the best phone for the money\nFlagship phones can cost a pretty penny, so if bang for your buck is what you're after, the OnePlus 13, which starts at $799 when you trade in any phone in any condition to OnePlus, is a far better deal than the $1,299 Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. In ways, you're getting more and better specs on the OnePlus than the Samsung, even though the former costs $500 less. For example, while the OnePlus 13 features a non-overclocked variant of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, tests have shown that the difference in performance is negligible.\nReview: OnePlus 13: This flagship costs hundreds less than S25 Ultra - but wins in key ways\nAt the time of writing, the OnePlus 13 also comes with a free storage upgrade, which nets you a 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage configuration for the same price as the base tier. That's compared to the S25 Ultra, which starts at 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage (if you take advantage of Samsung's free upgrade offer).\n2. You'd rather not have to sit by the outlet\nOne of the key reasons to buy a OnePlus phone is its fast charging speeds. This year's model features the same 80W wired charging and 50W wireless charging as its predecessor, but even then, those numbers outpace what Samsung is offering with the S25 Ultra. With 80W wired charging (via the SuperVooc charger included in the box), the OnePlus 13 can charge from 0% to 100% in less than 40 minutes. To put things into perspective, even the 50W wireless charging is faster than the S25 Ultra's wired charging, which caps out at 45W.\nAlso: The best Android phones to buy in 2025\nThe OnePlus 13 also features a larger 6,000mAh silicon-based battery, compared to the S25 Ultra's 5,000mAh lithium-ion battery. Choosing this material over the traditional lithium-ion allows the phone maker to embed a denser battery capacity without adding bulk. From our tests, there's a noticeable difference in battery life that favors the OnePlus.\n3. Water damage traumatizes you\nTo protect the tech within, the OnePlus 13 is one of the first phones in the US market to feature an IP69 rating. Compared to the IP68 rating typically found on flagship phones like the S25 Ultra, the higher water resistance allows the OnePlus 13 to withstand high-pressure, high-temperature water jets and steam cleaning. So, if you happen to leave the handset in your pants as they're in the washer, or the device slips through your fingers and falls into a pot of boiling water or soup, it should be able to still function properly after a wipe."

In just a few more weeks, we'll learn more about Google's Pixel 10 series, which is expected to feature a whopping five phone models, so stay tuned.\nFact of the matter is, there are tons of phones shouting for your attention. When you're picking one, really think about what you need day-to-day. The best options on the market feature displays that can beat the outdoor sun, cameras that capture great photos in the most difficult lighting environments, and software features that truly enhance your communication and productivity.\nWhat is the best smartphone right now?\nAfter extensive testing of dozens of devices, our pick for the best phone overall is the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, thanks to its immersive and vibrant display, reliable battery life, and wealth of special features, some of which are powered by the company's latest generative artificial intelligence (AI) model.\nIt's not cheap at a starting price of $1,299, but our testing found it to be worth the money, especially if you can snag a carrier deal or trade-in promotion. Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max is a close second, with a thinner and larger design, a Camera Control key for precision capturing, and a suite of ever-improving Apple Intelligence features.\nOf course, our pick for the best phone overall may not be the best for you. No matter which option on this list you decide to invest in, expect it to be high-performing, have a display that is bright enough to use outdoors, and have a camera system that will fulfill your photography needs.\nAlso: The best Android phones to buy in 2025\nBest phones of 2025\nWhy we like it: The Galaxy S25 Ultra stands out as the premier handset so far in 2025 with its sophisticated integration of Galaxy AI and arsenal of hardware features. The latest Galaxy AI suite brings practical and useful features like real-time call translation, voice commands that work across multiple apps, and photo editing capabilities. Real-world testing suggests these AI functions surpass those on competing Android devices in speed, dependability, and overall usefulness.\nBeyond the AI, the phone has impressed us with its large 6.9-inch, anti-reflective, AMOLED display and robust 5,000mAh battery. Performance is bolstered by the upgraded Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and 12GB of RAM, further enhanced by a larger cooling chamber ideal for multimedia and gaming. The smartphone also excels in durability with its lightweight titanium frame and new resilient Corning Gorilla Armor 2 glass.\nFurthermore, the camera system is significantly upgraded with a 50MP ultrawide lens that captures landscape and macro shots with greater detail and vibrancy. We've run several camera tests between the S25 Ultra and competing phones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and found the Samsung model to deliver the sharpest and vibrant imagery.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\nWho it's for: The Galaxy S25 Ultra is primarily targeted towards users who demand the best smartphone experience Samsung can provide and are keen to explore the latest consumer-facing AI features. It represents a particularly compelling upgrade for individuals holding onto three to four-year-old devices, offering significant advancements across the board.\nThe strong build makes it an excellent choice for those who prioritize device protection against everyday mishaps. Multimedia enthusiasts will appreciate the large, anti-reflective, 6.9-inch screen combined with enhanced cooling technology. Additionally, photography lovers looking for improved detail and color in wide-angle and close-up macro shots will find the new 50MP ultrawide camera valuable.\nWho should look elsewhere: Despite its strengths, the Galaxy S25 Ultra's $1,300 price point makes it out of reach for budget-conscious consumers. In addition, users who frequently utilize the S Pen's Bluetooth gestures for actions like remotely triggering the camera may be disappointed, as the functionality has been removed.\nFurthermore, individuals who prefer a less angular or \"boxy\" phone design might find the standard Galaxy S25 or S25 Plus models more aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to hold. If you prefer a less bloated software experience, consider the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL or OnePlus 13, both of which also cost less than the Ultra.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Display size: 6.9 inches | Storage options: Up to 1TB | Rear cameras: 200MP main, 50MP ultrawide, 50MP telephoto with 5x zoom, 10MP telephoto with 3x zoom | Front camera: 12MP | Battery: 5,000mAh | Price: Starting at $1,300\nWhy we like it: The iPhone 16 Pro Max cements its position as Apple's pinnacle smartphone offering over the last year, delivering a comprehensive package for the premium user. Its standout feature is arguably the expansive and brilliant 6.9-inch AMOLED display, ideal for immersive media consumption and mobile productivity alike.\nThe 2024 model introduce a noticeable design change with thinner bezels that enhance the larger screen feel, alongside the addition of the new Camera Control button. This physical switch allows for quick camera access and photo capturing without screen interaction, a feature ZDNET Editor-in-Chief Jason Hiner suggested \"is going to be super handy for people who take a ton of photos with the iPhone.\"\nThe latest A18 Pro chip drives the phone's performance, which our testing found to yield significantly faster and more efficient on-device AI processing. This is a key capability setting the stage for the various Apple Intelligence tools. This AI suite promises advanced tools like image generation, a more capable Siri, and notification summaries, positioning the 16 Pro Max as Apple's most \"future-proof\" device for the AI era. Camera capabilities are also further enhanced with 4K video recording at 120fps, enabling high-detail slow-motion editing, and Audio Mix technology to isolate and clarify voices in recordings.\nAn improved battery life, rated by Apple for 33 hours of video playback -- up from 29 hours, and newly added support for 25W MagSafe wireless charging round out the significant hardware upgrades.\nReview: iPhone 16 Pro Max\nWho it's for: The iPhone 16 Pro Max is squarely aimed at users demanding the most advanced features and capabilities available within the Apple ecosystem. It represents a compelling choice for individuals eager to explore Apple Intelligence features, which require a more modernized and powerful chipset like the A18 Pro. Photography and videography enthusiasts will find significant value in the new Camera Control button for quick captures, the high-frame-rate 4K video for creative flexibility, and the Audio Mix feature for clearer sound.\nFurthermore, power users who rely heavily on their device throughout the day will appreciate the substantial battery life improvement. The large, high-quality 6.9-inch display makes it ideal for those who consume a lot of video content, play graphics-intensive games, or use their phone extensively for productivity tasks. It's also the go-to for users upgrading from older iPhone models -- particularly pre-Pro Max generations -- seeking the biggest leaps in screen size, performance, and camera tech.\nWho should look elsewhere: The iPhone 16 Pro Max's $1,200 starting price could deter budget-conscious consumers, who might find better value in the standard iPhone 16 models or competitive Android offerings. Users who aren't heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem or prefer the customization and file management flexibility of Android should consider alternatives like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra or Google Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nAdditionally, individuals who find large phones unwieldy might prefer a smaller device, even within Apple's own lineup.\nAlso: Best password manager for iPhone\niPhone 16 Pro Max tech specs: Processor: A18 Pro | Display size: 6.9 inches | Storage options: Up to 1TB | Rear cameras: 48MP main, 12MP ultrawide, 12MP telephoto (2x), 12MP telephoto (5x) | Front camera: 12MP\nWhy we like it: The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the best foldable phone going into the rest of 2025, thanks to its ultra-thin form factor and market-leading camera system, which captures more lifelike images than competing models from OnePlus and Google, based on our tests.\nSamsung took the traditional smartphone route when refining the outer display of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, opting for a wider, more regular aspect ratio panel than last year's narrower Galaxy Z Fold 6. That makes a notable difference in hand-feel and ergonomics, even though the two phones are only $100 apart. Compared to the standard slab-style phone, you're simply getting more screen with the Z Fold 7, with a larger 8-inch display when unfolded. For reference, most modern-day phones range from 6 to 6.8 inches.\nNaturally, all the content I've been consuming on the phone, like video streaming, social media feeds, and Google Maps, is portrayed in a highly consumable manner; nothing feels disorienting or cropped out. While the foldable doesn't match its Ultra sibling spec-for-spec, the Z Fold 7 truly shines and more than makes up for the \"inferior\" 200MP camera system in long exposure shots and selfies, thanks to its self-standing nature.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\nWho it's for: I often recommend the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold over other foldables because of Samsung's feature-rich approach to software. Running on the OneUI launcher (over Android 16) means you can expect a simple yet customizable user interface, with support for up to seven years of operating system and security updates. I can't say the same for the OnePlus Open or Motorola Razr.\nThis ultra-slim form factor is also ideal for multitaskers and other users who want to see as much information at once as possible without reaching for a tablet or laptop. You simply won't find a foldable with better ergonomics right now than this.\nWho should look elsewhere: With a starting price tag of $1,999, you're mostly paying for the innovation factor with this phone. So if you're more interested in a safe and reliable handset that's arguably much easier to repair, then I'd recommend a traditional slab phone like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series instead.\nUsers shopping for a foldable phone should consider the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold if they prefer a handset with less bloatware and a stubbier design, or last year's Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 if they want S Pen stylus support, which the Z Fold 7 omits.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Display sizes: 6.5-inch exterior and 8-inch interior | Storage options: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB | Rear cameras: 200MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto | Front cameras: 10MP front | Battery: 4,400mAh | Price: Starting at $1,999\nWhy we like it: The CMF Phone 2 Pro is a top contender for the best cheap phone available today, offering remarkable value at just $279. It distinguishes itself from competitors, even those costing significantly more, with unique design features focused on user control and customization. Among these is the ability to easily swap back covers, attach screw-in accessories like kickstands or wallets, and expand storage via a MicroSD card -- a feature increasingly rare in modern smartphones.\nImpressively, the Phone 2 Pro avoids major compromises on essential specifications often seen at this price point. Our testing found the 3,000-nit OLED display to be notably bright, ensuring comfortable outdoor visibility. This also represents a significant upgrade from the previous model with improved contrast and color reproduction ideal for media.\nThe large 5,000mAh battery delivers solid endurance for most users, enough to comfortably last our reviewers a day of usage. Furthermore, Nothing's streamlined interpretation of Android is a highlight, offering a thoughtful, bloatware-light experience enriched with unique widgets that enhance usability without unnecessary clutter.\nReview: CMF Phone 2 Pro\nWho it's for: This device primarily targets budget-conscious buyers seeking the best possible features and experience without breaking the bank. Its unique customization options, including the swappable backs and accessory system, make it perfect for users who enjoy personalizing their tech. The MicroSD card slot is a major draw for anyone needing ample, affordable storage expansion on top of the base 256GB configuration.\nThe CMF Phone 2 Pro is also an excellent choice for users who prioritize a clean software experience and appreciate the distinctive design elements of Nothing OS. For individuals whose primary phone usage involves browsing, social media, messaging, and media consumption, the bright display, reliable battery life, and adequate performance deliver a satisfying daily experience well beyond what its price tag might suggest.\nWho should look elsewhere: Users who engage in frequent, graphics-intensive gaming or heavy multitasking may find the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro processor underpowered. A device with a stronger chipset would be more suitable.\nWhile the camera system is competent for the price and includes a telephoto lens, its performance in low-light conditions lags behind competitors, making it less ideal for those prioritizing photography in challenging environments. The Google Pixel 9a might be a better fit here.\nMost importantly, potential buyers must be aware of its network limitations. The CMF Phone 2 Pro lacks the necessary band support for use on the Verizon network in the US.. For those needing Verizon compatibility, stronger performance, or better low-light camera capabilities within the budget segment, alternatives like the Motorola Moto G Power 2025 or the Google Pixel 9a should be considered.\nCMF Phone 2 Pro by Nothing tech specs: Display size: 6.77 inches | Display type: OLED | Resolution: 2780 x 1264 | Refresh rate: 120Hz | Battery life: 5,000mAh | RAM: 8GB | Storage: 256GB | Rear camera: 50MP main, 8MP ultra-wide, 50MP telephoto | Front camera: 16MP | Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro | Price: Starting at $279\nWhy we like it: Deciding on the best flip-style foldable phone came down to the wire, with Motorola's Razr Ultra just scraping by Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 7. I went hands-on with the new Razr Ultra model earlier this year, and was thoroughly impressed by the improved hinge system (read: the phone feels sturdier to flip open and close), as well as the performance, which is underpinned by an updated Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and 12GB of RAM.\nMotorola's outer display still supports virtually any app you throw at it, meaning you can browse the web, play games, scroll TikTok, and do other mobile tasks without ever needing to flip open the device. Samsung's platform is more limited in this regard, which always felt like a missed opportunity when testing.\nIt also helps that the Razr Ultra has a textured backing, including new Alcantara and Wood finishes, which I've found to be easier to hold and grip than competing flip phones. Considering how fragile these foldable devices can be -- anything with so many moving parts typically are -- the enhanced grip is easy to appreciate.\nReview: Motorola Razr Ultra (2025)\nWho it's for: At $1,299, the Razr Ultra is not a cheap flip phone by any means. That's why its more affordable siblings, the Razr and Razr Plus exist. But if you want the most complete, durable, and visually-stimulating flip phone on the market right now, you'll have to pay to play with the Razr Ultra.\nI applauded Motorola for exploring new color and material finishes with this year's Razr, and that's something fashion-forward users will likely favor too. The battery on this year's model -- 4,700mAh, up from 4,000mAh -- is also much larger, which you can never really complain about.\nWho should look elsewhere: When buying the Razr Ultra, you should also consider aspects like Motorola's relatively short software update cadence, which ranges from 2 to 3 years, versus Google and Samsung's 7 years. If you're looking for a phone that's even more forgiving when dropped, I'd invest in a traditional slab handset instead, like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series or iPhone 16 Pro series.\nMotorola Razr Ultra (2025) tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Display sizes: 4-inch exterior and 7-inch interior | Storage options: 512GB, 1TB | Cameras: 50MP wide, 50MP ultrawide, 32MP front | Battery: 4,700mAh | Price: $1,299\nWhy we like it: The Google Pixel 9 Pro series -- comprising the $800 Pixel 9 Pro and $900 Pro XL -- consistently sets the standard for computational photography in the smartphone market. While flagship cameras from Apple and Samsung are impressive, we've found Google's system frequently excels, particularly demonstrating superior shutter speed for capturing fast action, nuanced post-processing, and natural-looking color accuracy compared to rivals like the Galaxy S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max. This results in photos that are balanced in color and generally satisfying to view.\nBoth Pro models feature the same, highly capable and reliable triple-lens setup -- 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide, 48MP 5x telephoto -- adept at capturing everything from wide vistas to distant subjects like statues and buildings with clarity. I've taken the Pro XL with me to several product events across the country, and the camera system has been very reliable.\nThis hardware is further enhanced by clever software features like Google's Super Res Zoom --offering usable shots up to 30x, 8K video upscaling, and the more recent \"Add Me\" feature for merging two photos -- perfect for group shots without needing someone else to take the picture. The phones are powered by the latest Tensor G4 chip, which powers features like Magic Editor, Photo Unblur, and Best Take, to allow users to effortlessly rescue or creatively enhance nearly any shot, making post-processing incredibly versatile.\nReview: Google Pixel 9 Pro XL\nWho it's for: The Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL are primarily designed for users who prioritize a best-in-class mobile photography experience, valuing reliable point-and-shoot results, accurate color representation, and the ability to cleanly capture challenging, fast-moving subjects. It's the ideal choice for individuals keen on utilizing cutting-edge AI tools to easily edit and perfect their photos after capture.\nValue-conscious buyers looking for flagship camera performance without the absolute top-tier pricing of Apple or Samsung's highest models will find the Pixel 9 Pro series particularly appealing. Furthermore, users who frequently utilize zoom capabilities for distant objects or appreciate the clean software experience and unique AI features synonymous with the Google ecosystem are prime candidates for these devices.\nWho should look elsewhere: Despite its photographic strengths, the Pixel 9 Pro series may not be the perfect fit for everyone. Users whose primary focus is videography, requiring the absolute best image stabilization and motion smoothing capabilities, should consider the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which I still fall back on for recording content. Those who desire the maximum hardware customization, extensive manual camera controls, or specific hardware features like integrated stylus support might find the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra more aligned with their needs.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro tech specs: Processor: Google Tensor G4 | Display size: 6.3 and 6.7 inches | Storage options: 128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB | Rear cameras: 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide, and 48MP telephoto | Front camera: 42MP | Battery: 4,700mAh/5,060mAh | Price: Starting at $800 (Pro) and $900 (Pro XL)\nWhy we like it: The OnePlus 13 delivers exceptional performance, class-leading battery life, and remarkable durability, all while maintaining a highly competitive price point. Starting at $900, it offers outstanding value compared to rivals like the $1,000 Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus and $900 Google Pixel 9 Pro, with value further enhanced by potential trade-in offers.\nUnder the hood, it boasts the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, generous RAM configurations up to 16GB, and a stunning 6.82-inch QHD+ LTPO AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and incredible peak brightness up to 4,500 nits.\nIts massive 6,000mAh battery scored high ratings with ZDNET's endurance tests. It's complemented by market-leading 80W wired charging capable of a full charge in under 30-40 minutes and rapid 50W wireless charging.\nDurability is another strength, featuring an impressive IP69 rating for resistance against high-pressure, high-temperature water jets and humidity, along with Ceramic Guard screen protection.\nAdditions like an improved ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, unique design options including vegan leather backs, helpful screen features like Glove Mode, and the signature Alert Slider round out a compelling hardware package supporting a capable triple 50MP camera system.\nReview: OnePlus 13\nWho it's for: The OnePlus 13 is tailor-made for users seeking flagship-level performance, particularly in battery life and charging speeds, without the price tag. Its exceptional endurance and rapid charging make it ideal for heavy users and those always on the go. The robust IP69 rating appeals to individuals needing a phone that can withstand more demanding environments than typical IP68-rated devices.\nPerformance enthusiasts will appreciate the smooth operation driven by the Snapdragon 8 Elite and an ample 16GB of RAM. It's also a great fit for users who prefer a less AI-saturated software experience compared to some competitors, or those who appreciate OnePlus's distinct design philosophy and the tactile convenience of the Alert Slider, though that feature is reportedly being revamped soon.\nWho should look elsewhere: Despite its numerous strengths, the OnePlus 13 may not be the perfect choice for everyone. Users who prioritize purchasing through major U.S. carrier stores might find availability less convenient compared to Samsung or Google devices. While OnePlus offers a solid update policy of four years of OS updates up to Android 19 and six years of security, those seeking longer software support should try Google or Samsung flagships. These often promise seven years.\nAlthough the triple 50MP camera system is highly capable, users demanding the utmost consistency in computational photography, particularly in challenging zoom or low-light scenarios, might still prefer the specialized output from Google Pixel or high-end Samsung models. Additionally, users heavily reliant on MagSafe or Qi2 accessories should note that native magnetic attachment requires a specific OnePlus case.\nOnePlus 13 tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Display size: 6.8 inches | Storage options: 256GB/512GB | Rear cameras: 50MP main, 50MP ultrawide, and 50MP telephoto | Front camera: 32MP | Battery: 6,000mAh | Price: Starting at $900\nTop smartphones compared\nOur pick for the best phone overall is the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. It features everything you could want from a smartphone, including a large display, four cameras that can shoot 200MP photos and 8K video, up to 1TB of storage, a built-in S Pen for writing and drawing, and a 5,000mAh battery powering the system. Here's how the S24 Ultra fares with the rest of our top picks.\nBest phone model | Price | Storage | Screen size | Battery size | Processor |\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | $1,300 | Up to 1TB | 6.9 inches | 5,000mAh | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy |\niPhone 16 Pro Max | $1,200 | Up to 1TB | 6.9 inches | 4,323mAh (est.) | A18 Pro Bionic |\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL | $900 | Up to 1TB | 6.7 inches | 5,060mAh | Google Tensor G4 |\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 | $2,000 | Up to 1TB | 6.5 inches and 8 inches | 4,400mAh | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite |\nMotorola Razr Ultra | $1,300 | Up to 512GB | 7 inches | 4,700mAh | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite |\nCMF Phone 2 Pro | $279 | Up to 256GB | 6.77 inches | 5,000mAh | MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro 5G |\nOnePlus 13 | $900 | Up to 512GB | 6.8 inches | 6,000mAh | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite |\n*MSRP at the time of writing\nWhich is the right phone for you?\nHaving a list of your must-have smartphone features can go a long way toward narrowing down your options. If you're a mobile professional or travel a lot for work, you'll want to choose a phone that can provide you with at least a full day of use on a full battery and both LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity.\nIf you're looking for your teen's first smartphone, a budget-friendly and less feature-heavy option may be better to prevent overspending and misuse. If you're a content creator or other creative professional, you'll want a phone with an excellent front and rear camera to capture photos and videos for your social media feed.\nChoose this best phone... | If you want... |\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | A no-compromise smartphone that virtually any type of user can take advantage of.

The OnePlus 13 is quietly good value, too, starting at $900. |\nAndroid vs iOS: How to decide\nAndroid:\nGoogle's operating system has always been about personalization, app freedom, and flexible use cases. For example, dozens of Android manufacturers launch phones annually, while iOS runs only on Apple's iPhone, which releases two models yearly. Naturally, there are more Android app developers, niche software and services, and form factors that go beyond the glass slab.\nPros:\n- Customization: While the latest iPhone software, iOS 26, is the most customizable version yet, Android is still ahead in modifying settings, looks and appearance, and more. You can adjust settings on a per-app basis, install third-party launchers, icon packs, and other services, and even tweak system animations to make the operating system faster.\n- App variety: According to AppExperts, there are over 3.5 million Android apps on the Google Play Store and more than 1.8 million apps on the iOS App Store. That's a big difference in volume that ultimately impacts users who desire more niche and specific apps for work and play. For example, while both platforms will carry services like WhatsApp and Instagram, Android usually has the upper hand with companion apps for consumer products, unreleased APKs, and more. There's also free access to sideload apps from third-party stores -- that process is exclusive to European users as far as iOS is concerned.\n- Price and availability: Both Android and iOS are offered across the mid-to-high price tiers, but the former goes a step further with options that cater to budget-oriented shoppers. If you're shopping for a smartphone for less than $300, unless you're willing to buy a second-hand iPhone that's already a few generations old, Android handsets are your best option. Android phones also come in foldable form factors, from clamshell-style devices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 to book-style ones like the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\nCons:\n- Security and privacy: The abundance of Android phones and app makers means there are more opportunities for cybercriminals to access your personal information and/or install malware. How these attacks are prevented and managed also varies across manufacturers, with some OEMs like Google doing a better job than others like Xiaomi.\n- Inconsistency with quality: Like security and privacy, you must always consider which Android maker you're buying a phone from and what it offers across different price ranges. Larger legacy brands like Samsung have a greater reputation for quality assurance and value. In contrast, smaller, newer brands like Nothing and OnePlus must prove themselves, sometimes taking risks that backfire in the process.\niOS:\nThe iPhone's operating system remains one of the most robust and closed in on the market, with unique features that only amplify the Apple hardware experience. Whether you're using an older or newer iPhone, iOS offers superior feature parity across generations than Android, with extended software support being one of its biggest benefits.\nPros:\n- Exclusive, ecosystem-based services: Strength in numbers is the name of the game for iOS, with the operating system notorious for its exclusive apps and services, such as iMessage and FaceTime, which make switching away from the iPhone more difficult than it should be. It helps that Apple has surrounded the iPhone with hardware and software that work harmoniously with iOS, including AirDropping files into a MacBook, pulling health data from an Apple Watch, and, just recently, supporting hearing aid tests via AirPods Pro 2.\n- Quality of apps: Beyond the first-party apps, US developers often spend more time creating and optimizing iOS apps than Android apps due to the percentage of users. Naturally, services like Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok function more fluidly on iOS than on Android.\n- Longevity: When you buy a new iPhone, expect upwards of seven years of software support. While Android makers like Google and Samsung have begun to match Apple's software update policy, the Cupertino tech giant remains the most consistent and reliable, regardless of the model. For reference, Samsung has a better track record of updating its flagship phones than its midrange phones.\nCons:\n- Restrictive experience: Apple has loosened its grip on customizability over the years, with last year's iOS 18 update finally allowing users to freely place apps and widgets anywhere on the home screen grid. However, compared to Android, the iPhone software still has a ways to go. For example, you still can't customize notification types at a per-app level, set navigation gestures beyond swiping from the left side to go back, or download third-party app icons.\n- Poor file management: If you've ever downloaded an image from the web on an iPhone, you'll know just how cumbersome it can be to locate that file later on. Sometimes, downloaded photos and videos will be directed into the file manager app first, requiring further action to fully migrate them into the Photos app.\nFactors to consider when choosing a phone\nThe process of making our phone selections includes real-world testing and researching about the phones for weeks, consulting with colleagues, industry experts, and analysts who also have hands-on experience with the smartphones, and then selecting the best from all of the available choices.\nUltimately, we weigh in the following aspects when curating this list:\n- Design: There's only so much you can do with a slab design, but size differences, material choices, color options, and even the ability to bend a screen in half give shoppers enough diversity to have a preference. That's why we have a recommendation for every form factor.\n- Performance: For many, smartphones are the center of our lives, which means the best ones are performant and can handle most, if not all, tasks you throw at them.\n- Camera: Arguably the most valuable feature of a smartphone; the consistency and reliability of a camera system can make or break the overall mobile experience. We test every device in broad daylight and in the darkest of nights when finalizing this list.\n- Battery: Every option in this guide should last you at least a day of moderate use. We also consider what devices support fast charging and/or wireless charging.\n- Value: Price points are noted, but the most important thing with buying a phone is getting your money's worth. With these picks, you can rest assured that you're getting the best bang for your buck.\nHow we test phones\nZDNET's review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every major phone release, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and special features. Here's a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:\n- Design and ergonomics: How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.\n- Performance: Several factors affect a phone's performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, with all background tasks closed, and with as stable of a mobile connection as possible.\n- Camera quality: ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.\n- Battery life and charging: It's also important for us to evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it -- wired, wireless, or both.\n- Special features: These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users, not the opposite.\n- Pricing and availability: Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.\nFor a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive phone testing methodology page.\nKerry Wan's smartphone advice\nI've used dozens of smartphones in the past year alone, learning the ins and outs -- the tips and tricks -- to make the most out of my handset.

Tap on that seven times and you should see a pop-up indicating that Developer Options has been turned on. Now, the activated tab will appear in the main settings list. From within, scroll down until you find Windows, Transition, and Animator duration scale. Tap into each and switch from the 1x default setting to .5x to double the speed of your phone's animations.\nOptimizing your battery health\nTo preserve your phone's battery life, it's best to charge it between 20% and 80% and never let it drop to 0% or charge fully to 100%. This is because the heat generated from overcharging the phone can burn -- or degrade -- the battery, reducing its number of charge cycles. This phenomenon is the reason why you shouldn't charge your phone overnight or leave it plugged in for an extended period of time.\nWhen in doubt, after a year or two of usage, consider getting your phone's battery swapped to refresh its charge cycles. You'll be amazed at how well it functions again.\nHow to keep your phone clean\nUnless you're invested in a repairs and warranty plan like Apple Care, consider suiting your phone with a protective case and/or tempered glass screen protector. Beyond drop protection, the two accessories will prevent the phone from getting scratches, scuffs, and other blemishes and can greatly reduce the chance of water damage. For what it's worth, if a manufacturer claims its phone is rated IP68, that means the device can withstand dust ingress and be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes at one meter deep.\nOccasionally, take an alcohol pad and give your phone a wipe-down. If you think about it, your phone is just as likely to accumulate germs as your hands, so don't forget to clean it.\nFAQ on smartphones in 2025\nWhen do new phones come out?\nWhile the year just started, we can look at past industry trends to understand when new phones will be released. Below is a list of expected release dates/timeframe for major phones in 2025.\n- Samsung Galaxy S25 series: January\n- OnePlus 13 series: January\n- Apple iPhone 16e: February\n- Google Pixel 9a: March\n- Motorola Razr Ultra: May\n- Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: May\n- Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7: July\n- Google Pixel 10 series: August\n- Apple iPhone 17 series: September\nWhen is the Google Pixel 10 series expected to release?\nGoogle recently confirmed that its next \"Made by Google\" hardware event, which showcases the company's latest Pixel, Nest, and other products, will take place on August 20, 2025 in New York.\nAt this summer's product event, we're expecting the company to debut the new Pixel 10 Series, featuring the standard Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold, alongside new Pixel Watches and earbuds.\nWhat's new with iOS 26?\nIf you're an iPhone user, the upcoming software version, iOS 26, introduces a slew of new features and design changes to be excited about. In fact, if you're open to testing Apple's public beta version, you can sign up for that (with an eligible iPhone model) right now.\nAlso: The iOS 26 public beta is out now - how to install (and which iPhones support it)\nWith iOS 26, the biggest feature is arguably Apple's Liquid Glass design language, which applies a level of transparency and fluidness across buttons, settings menus, and other interfaces. Apple says the new UI is inspired by VisionOS, which powers the brand's XR headset and should invoke a sense of natural motion and smoothness.\nSome more practical iOS features include Hold Assist in the revamped Phone app, more customizations in Messages, a more functional CarPlay experience, and Live Translation across various popular apps.\nWhich phone is best for money?\nBesides the ones listed above, the OnePlus 13R is another great pick for the money. At $600, the device features a large 6.7-inch display with 120Hz refresh rate, a 50MP main camera system, a 6,000mAh battery that beats that of higher-cost devices, and 80W wired charging. The real kicker is OnePlus' aggressive trade-in offer, with the company discounting $100 when you turn in any phone in any condition, effectively bringing the 13R's price down to $500.\nWhich phone has the best camera?\nWhether the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Google Pixel 9 Pro, and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra are the best is debatable. For long-distance shots, Samsung's 200MP rear camera with 100x Space Zoom can capture subjects as far out as the moon. Google's Pixel phones have always been at the top for point-and-shoot pictures and a rather simplified, but effective, camera experience. If you're a videographer at heart, then the iPhone 16 Pro Max, with the ability to record 4K videos at 120 frames per second and a new Camera Control button, is an excellent tool to get the shots you need.\nHow long should a phone battery last?\nThe average phone battery lasts about 22 hours on a full charge, which is great for staying connected on commutes, work flights, and evenings at home. But that's just the average. Actual use time varies by phone model, battery capacity, the power efficiency of its processor, and what you're using your phone for.\nFor example, the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max boasts a 32-hour battery life. But you'll get less than that if you habitually scroll through social media or stream video and music.\nHow much storage should my phone have?\nMost smartphones have a base storage capacity of 128GB, which is plenty of space for average users to download apps and music, take photos, and shoot videos. However, if you're a mobile or creative professional, you'll need more space. Many smartphones have expanded storage options up to 512GB or even 1TB, and you can always sync your phone to your preferred cloud storage service to free up local storage space.\nLatest updates\n- In our July update, we replaced the Google Pixel 9 Pro with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 for \"Best foldable Android phone.\" More information has also been added regarding Google's upcoming Pixel hardware event.\n- In our June update, we added information regarding confirmed information regarding the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, as well as replaced the Z Flip 6 for the Motorola Razr Ultra for \"best flip-style foldable phone.\"\n- In our May update, we added information regarding what other phones users can expect later this year, including the Galaxy S25 Edge, Z Flip 7, and Z Fold 7. The CMF Phone 1 has also been replaced by the CMF Phone 2 Pro for \"best cheap phone.\"\n- In our April update, we added information regarding Mobile World Congress (MWC). The OnePlus Open was also replaced by the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold for \"best foldable phone.\"\nOther phones we tested\nWhether you're looking to upgrade or get your first smartphone, Apple, Samsung, and OnePlus have great choices that ZDNET's tested and recommends."

      "text": "Hasselblad Natural Colour Solution\n(HNCS)\nThe Hasselblad Natural Colour Solution (HNCS) is a colour management system independently developed by Hasselblad. From the initial capture to post-editing. It empowers Hasselblad cameras to render genuine, true-to-life colours with smooth, detailed transitions to restore the world of colours as perceived by the human eye.\nA Pursuit of Uncompromising Colour\nHasselblad believes that photographers should not have to compromise on colour accuracy.\nThe typical solution for achieving colour that looks \u201cright\u201d is to provide different profiles depending on the subject. Each profile, such as portraits, still lifes, or landscapes, has its own colour rendering based on assumptions about the subject. However, photography is rarely this categorical and often combines multiple subject types in one photo. We at Hasselblad think photographers should not have to wrestle with choosing profiles or worry about sacrificing some colours in order to capture others perfectly.\nIn 2004, amid the development of a medium-format digital camera, Hasselblad engineers decided to create an all-new colour management system. One that empowers every single Hasselblad digital camera to reproduce all colours authentically in every illumination. Hasselblad engineers listened to photographers around the world about their views on colour and their desire for colour rendering with smooth tonal transitions and a profile with uncompromising skin tone reproduction.\nWith the consideration of photographer's needs and over 50 years in camera development, Hasselblad engineers constructed a universal colour management system that fits all shooting scenarios - the Hasselblad Natural Colour Solution. It brings reliable, accurate colour rendering and frees photographers from complicated preset colour profiles. True-to-life colours by default.\nWhat Goes Into Hasselblad's Unique Colours?\nEvery Hasselblad medium-format camera has undergone stringent pixel-level calibration to achieve consistent high-standard light sensing capabilities. This, plus Hasselblad\u2019s high-quality medium-format lenses, lays a solid foundation for accurate colour rendering.\nThe human eye automatically enhances details and contrast. If a camera simply restores accurate colour values in technical terms, it would be monotonous and boring, nowhere near what the human eye actually perceives. In order to take care of these subtleties, HNCS also optimises tone and contrast.\n\u00a9 Donald Michael Chambers\nX2D 100C + XCD 2,5/55V\n\u00a9 Donald Michael Chambers\nX2D 100C + XCD 2,5/55V\nHasselblad\u2019s understanding of natural colours brings together HNCS. It includes an independently developed Hasselblad look-up-table (LUT), Hasselblad Film Curve, and unique colour processing that together adapts to any illumination. The colour data undergoes a series of transformations that remap the captured values. This ensures true contrast, rich saturation, and tricky subtle tones \u2013 like skin tones \u2013 are kept smooth, even between highlights and shadows.\n\u00a9 Linus Englund\nX2D 100C + XCD 2,5/55V\n\u00a9 Jianjun Wang\nX2D 100C + XCD 4/21\nThe results are a film-like image quality with true-to-life, wide-ranging contrast. Whether it is JPEG photos directly out of the camera or 3FR files from Hasselblad\u2019s image processing software Phocus, the results will always be the genuine \u201cHasselblad colour\".\nPost-processing is also taken into consideration in HNCS. With Phocus, image data is edited in one of the Hasselblad working spaces with minimal data loss. The data is also optimised to keep skin tones as unaffected as possible even after applying curves and contrast changes. For users requiring a wider gamut, such as museums or reproduction houses, there is Hasselblad L*RGB colour space, which contains nearly all colours from the LAB colour space. It enables users to work with difficult lighting conditions and highly saturated colours. Additionally, using the Phocus colour calibration tool, users are able to create custom calibrations to obtain optimal colour precision.\nHNCS works from the initial shot to post-editing, from colour accuracy, tone, contrast, transition in colour space and more. It delivers consistent, accurate, and true-to-life colours, rendering every single photo in hallmark \u201cHasselblad colour\u201d. With HNCS, the need for choosing a specific colour profile to capture accurate colours is gone, and users can manipulate and play with colours for extensive creative freedom."

      "text": "Samsung is giving these Galaxy phones a big One UI upgrade - here's which models qualify\nSamsung has officially launched its One UI 8 beta program, and you can sign up to be among the first to test it out -- if you have a compatible device.\nIn an announcement earlier this week, Samsung said the new platform, which is based on Android 16, would bring \"a new era of software intelligence\" to Galaxy devices along with several other upgrades. Here's a look at what's new and how you can join.\nWhich phones are eligible for the One UI 8 beta?\nFor now, the rollout is only for three devices in the S25 series \u2013 the S25, the S25 Plus, and the S25 Ultra. Sorry, S25 Edge owners. Samsung didn't offer an explanation for why it left out the S25 Edge, but it could be because the phone is already facing criticism for its reduced battery life.\nAlso: The best Samsung phones to buy in 2025\nThis follows the same pattern as last year's One UI 7 beta, which debuted for select S24 devices. One UI 8 will be available on Samsung's newest foldable devices this summer and will gradually expand to other Galaxy devices later this year. One UI 7 was exclusive to the S24 for about three months, which was frustrating for fans with other devices, but that might not be the case this time around.\nWhat's new in Samsung One UI 8?\nIt's no surprise that AI leads the way in terms of what's new. Samsung says that the One UI 8 beta isn't necessarily introducing any new features, but will enhance existing AI features that were first introduced in the Galaxy S25. You'll notice changes in three ways: multimodal capabilities, a user experience tailored to different devices, and personalized, proactive suggestions.\nAlso: I changed 7 Samsung phone settings to give it an instant battery boost\nSamsung explains that the new multimodality will understand what you're looking at or watching and be able to have natural, seamless communication about it, even understanding context about your daily routine. The \"tailored to different devices\" part essentially means that Samsung is making sure that tablets and foldable phones get a unique look that suits their design (much like Google did with Android 16).\nAlso new:\n- Refreshed Quick Share: The Quick Share feature, which lets you send and receive files between compatible Galaxy devices, is getting a redesign that lets you share with a single tap.\n- Redesigned Reminder app: Your Reminder app is getting a little more intuitive, especially for travel. You can now add categories to reminders and see all your categories at a glance, share to-do lists with other users, and add reminders with your voice.\n- Easier Auracast: Auracast, which lets you broadcast audio to multiple devices (like Galaxy Buds3 and hearing aids) at the same time, is getting a little easier to use. You can now connect to a shared audio stream by simply scanning a QR code instead of going through a manual process.\nHow to sign up for the Samsung One UI 8 beta\nIf you have a Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, or S25 Ultra device, signing up for the One UI 8 beta is easy. Head to the Samsung Members app and find the \"One UI Beta Program\" banner.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

The electronics have improved, but the basic act of operating a digital camera has remained mostly the same. Cameras are a gaggle of buttons that are a cryptic arrangement to anyone but the initiated.\nThe real innovation in the picture-taking experience has been the smartphone, which has made picture-taking an always-available tool for documenting everything with relative ease.\nThere is still an audience, however, for innovation beyond what smartphones offer. Young consumers keep buying digital cameras, and a new generation is always interested to learn more about photography as an art.\nAlso: The best vlogging cameras of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nInto the void steps lens and camera maker Sigma Corp., based in Kanagawa, Japan, just outside Tokyo. The company this spring introduced a radical redesign of the digital camera's basic mode of use.\nThe Sigma BF, as it's called, reduces the mass of buttons to a small set of touch-sensitive controls. All the functions of digital photography are still there to be experimented with and exploited -- shutter speed, lens aperture, or \"f-stop,\" and \"ISO,\" the level of light that can be recovered from a scene -- but they are under your command in a radically simplified user interface.\nI've been testing the BF for some weeks now, and I'm smitten with the changes. The hardware's design is beautiful, and the new user interface is very thoughtful. The name \"BF\" stands for \"beautiful foolishness,\" and you could say this kind of redesign is crazy, but I love it.\nA camera for a new age of photographers\nSigma, a sixty-three-year-old company, makes most of its money from lenses for all camera brands. As a result, its cameras have tended to be somewhat experimental, never selling in the same volume as Sony, Canon, or Nikon. That means that the company takes chances. Often, the results are wild and beautiful.\nThe BF is really meant for a new age of prosumers who want to up their game in photography. At a retail price of $2,199, the price is not insignificant, but it is on the low end for what you'd pay for a very good 35mm digital camera these days. Lenses, which have to be bought separately, run from about $600 for a fixed focal length \"prime\" lens to $1,300 or more for zoom lenses. The BF uses what's called an \"L-mount,\" which means you're not limited to Sigma's lenses; it's also compatible with lenses from Leica, Panasonic, Samyang, and Sirui.\nAlso: Eufy's latest security camera has AI-powered color night vision - and no monthly fees\nThe premise of stepping up your game from the smartphone camera is pretty simple, to my mind: You will never, ever, get as good a picture with any smartphone camera as you will with a camera that has a real lens. The lens is the key. The optics are just so superior to the optics on a smartphone.\nI tested the BF with a 50mm prime lens from Sigma, the same kind I already use for most of my photography.\nNo matter what you are photographing, there are immediate benefits to using a real camera versus a smartphone camera.\nOne benefit is the detail you get. Here's a picture of a butterfly landing on some vegetation in a vivarium. When cropping the image to see the butterfly up close, you'll get a level of detail that is clean rather than the murky detail you get even with a smartphone's optical zoom:\n(None of these photos have been edited. They are all straight out of the camera. In some cases, the file size has been compressed to accommodate the publishing system.)\nNot only detail but also control of the depth of field via the aperture dial on the lens provides control over the selective blurring of objects, the \"bokeh.\"\nSmartphones will give you fake bokeh that is generated in software rather than the actual bending of the light via the lens elements. Rarely will fake bokeh give you a really complex, thrilling effect where both foreground and background elements are selectively blurred, leading to a more sophisticated image, such as this cypress I snapped in New York's Central Park:\nAnd even when fake bokeh works, I don't think you'll achieve the almost holographic, floating beauty you get with a real lens while preserving all the detail of the foreground subject, as with this thistle:\nThe second advantage is that a real lens will give you more real proportions than a smartphone lens that has a lot of barrel distortion. Like a building architectural shot or this bank vault:\nYou can get a nice, crisp skyline shot at twilight as the light changes:\nA swing to simplicity\nWhere the BF departs from other cameras is in the simplicity of design and user interface.\nThe hardware is, very simply, a solid shell milled from a block of aluminum and then filled with electronics. It's a gorgeous manufactured object with a super solid feel. (Sigma cameras always feel super solid, but this is on a new level.)\nThe BF's body is one of the lightest full-frame mirrorless cameras on the market, at just under a pound, compared to devices such as the Sony a7 IV, which weighs nearly a pound and a half.\nFor non-camera users, the weight of any real camera is something of a surprise compared to a smartphone such as an Apple iPhone Pro, which weighs half a pound. Holding 15 ounces worth of an unfamiliar object prompted some people to whom I handed the BF to remark, \"It's so heavy!\"\nAlso: First look at iPhone 17 Pro? Public images seemingly confirm big design and camera changes\nThe total weight of the camera is the combination of the 15 ounces and the 12 ounces of the 50mm Sigma lens. That kind of heft is typical of full-frame lenses because they have a lot of glass inside them. (And this particular Sigma lens is not very heavy as 50-millimeter lenses go.)\nThe real adjustment for a novice photographer is getting used to the balance of weight between camera and lens versus carrying a slab of a smartphone with uniform weight distribution.\nThe camera comes in two finishes, a striking silver color and a deep black. I chose to try the black as I like to use the camera often in discreet settings such as a jazz club, so I wanted something less flashy than the silver.\nThe sensor is a full-frame, 35mm Sony chip with just under 25 megapixels, less than the 60 megapixels in some 35mm cameras. Despite a lower pixel count, I found the sensor produced rich detail, certainly enough for Instagram pictures and possibly good enough for wall-sized prints depending on the exposure. Sony is a very reliable name for sensors, so it makes sense for Sigma to go with the market leader.\nImages are stored in the internal 230-gigabyte flash memory, which I found to be more than enough for my purposes. I usually offloaded the pictures onto my iPad or MacBook after each photo-taking session via USB-C and then cleared the BF's memory.\nAlso: Why the best fix for headless server frustration might be a little box named Comet\nOn the software side, the radical simplification of the user interface is striking -- it's even something of a revelation.\nI've been a user of Sigma cameras for over a decade, my main camera these days being the Sigma fp-L, a 60-megapixel model introduced a couple of years ago. I love that camera, but I would be very happy to see the changes in the BF user interface become standard on Sigma cameras going forward.\nThe main innovation is removing a lot of shooting information from the LCD screen. Instead of seeing the aperture or shutter speed and other settings constantly on the display, each setting on the BF occupies a separate, tiny LCD -- it's called a \"status monitor\" though I tend to think of it as simply a \"mini-LCD\" -- to the right of the main display.\nA click wheel just below the mini-LCD, formally called the \"dial pad,\" reminiscent of the first Apple iPod's click wheel, lets you rotate through the values of shutter speed, etc. The changing values are displayed on the mini-LCD as you do so, and you click the center button of the click wheel to select the setting you want.\nThere's also a touch-sensitive playback button, so you can peek at what you just snapped with a soft touch, and a touch-sensitive menu button, which is a quick way to peek at the camera's settings. And a power button at the bottom of all this, of course.\nThe effect is that the main display screen is a pristine window into what you're capturing in the real world, while the mini-LCD and the click-wheel are your controls. It's a nice division that elegantly separates the gaze from the adjustments.\nThe main LCD is a 2.1 megapixel model and is terrifically responsive for things such as selecting the focus area by tapping with your finger, or using pinch and swipe when looking through the photos you've taken.\nAlso: Stanford's holographic AI glasses are coming for your clunky VR headset\nIf you half-press the shutter button, the display momentarily shows the key settings before you fully commit to the shutter release. If you press on the center button of the click-wheel, or dial pad, extra settings come up for the function that's in focus, such as shutter speed.\nStreet photography delight\nThe BF's light weight and simplified user interface made for nice street photography, one of my favorite pastimes.\nI tended to carry the camera at my waist in one hand, holding onto the lens, sometimes with the camera body flipped upside-down, with my pinky finger on the shutter button. That way, I achieved a kind of nonchalant pose that did not draw attention to my picture-taking.\nAlso: I used Google's photo-to-video AI tool on my selfie - and it made me do the tango\nSometimes, I looked at the LCD to see what I was snapping, but oftentimes, I just took a picture in the general direction to see what chance would produce.\nThe autofocus function of the BF was super fast, notably faster than the response time of the fp-L, probably because of the BF's lower-megapixel-count sensor. That made for excellent motion capture, such as this basketball game:\nOne of the BF's shortcomings is having an electronic shutter: Instead of mechanical blades opening and closing, the sensor chip controls in software when the exposure happens. The common knock against an electronic shutter is that it can lead to blurring of fast motion. In the case of the basketball game, in late afternoon daylight, I saw no issue.\nAnother potential drawback is that indoors, in artificial light, the electronic shutter can produce dark bands across the image if the shutter speed is too fast. That can require you to take the picture at a slower shutter speed. In practice, I found it not to be much of a problem.\nImproved electronics\nIn addition to autofocus speed, Sigma has done a very good job with the BF's low-light support, which was already quite good on the fp-L.\nOne of my favorite low-light picture tests is a diorama in the North American mammals hall of the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. This is one of the darkest exhibits in the museum, and it's challenging to photograph if you don't have the camera resting on a tripod to allow for a long exposure.\nAlso: Why ads are coming to your favorite AI bots and you've only got yourself to blame\nTwo taxidermy wolves run on a painted landscape of the Michigan countryside. To the naked eye, the diorama is very, very dark because it is meant to suggest nighttime on the prairie. Here's what it typically looks like, taken with minimal low-light support by the BF:\nMost museum visitors who view the diorama turn on their smartphone camera's flash to take a souvenir shot. But, to my mind, flooding the scene with flash spoils the effect.\nInstead, I cranked up the BF to its highest ISO setting, 102,400 -- fairly high up there for any digital camera. The result is that the wolves emerge in beautiful detail from the darkness -- not as sharp or clean as if the scene were well-lighted, but that's the point:\nIn practice, the BF does a very nice job in darkly lit spaces where you might actually want a picture, such as a jazz club.\nWhen set on a tripod with professional lighting and a backdrop, the BF is also excellent for formal portraits, far better than what you'll get using a smartphone camera for your headshots.\nEven without using a macro lens, the 50mm will allow you to get pretty good closeup shots of something like your favorite toy, from a minimum distance of 18 inches, which you can then crop and still have lots of vivid detail.\nOf course, you could also add a macro lens to the BF and get even closer.\nA gentle introduction to pro features\nSigma has simplified some of the functions for newbies so that the same technical effects are present but in a more inviting fashion. For example, on the Sigma fp-L, a separate button is for \"tone control\" that lets you adjust the light across the scene by degrees for shadows and highlights to make a scene have more or less contrast.\nOn the BF, there's no button for tone control, but when selecting colors with the click-wheel, you can bump up or down values of \"highlight,\" \"shadow,\" and \"fade,\" to alter the degrees of lights and darks. That works in both still images and videos.\nAlso: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out\nThere's also an option called \"look effect,\" where you can dial up or down how vivid or how flat a given color filter is, which is a nice, obvious way to understand making your pictures or videos more striking or more sedate.\nIn practice, the BF does a great job with tone and exposure on automatic. A street scene at sunset, for example, nicely balances the vivid highlights of the sky with the street detail without blown highlights or detail lost in the shadows.\nWhen you review photos, the main LCD display gives you all the information on the tone adjustments you made, which is helpful for determining what works and what doesn't.\nSome things that are typically buried in sub-menus on digital cameras are brought forward in the BF's UI.\nSo, for example, when filming a movie, you have the option to turn on \"constant AF,\" which does a better job of grabbing hold of a new subject entering the frame. That is now an option from the click-wheel rather than being buried as a sub-menu option.\nOf course, there are trade-offs to simplicity. Other functions that were accessed directly via dedicated buttons on digital cameras become things you have to hunt for.\nFor example, auto-exposure lock forces the camera to keep the amount of light in the scene the same as you move it, rather than altering the exposure. This allows you to find the right balance of light and dark and hold onto it while you shift your focus.\nAlso: The 10 apps I can't live or work without - on Windows, Mac, and mobile\nOn the fp-L, auto-exposure lock has its own button. In the BF, you have to move the click wheel to the exposure section of the menus and then turn on auto-exposure lock by tapping on the icon. This extra step is fine if you don't use auto-exposure lock much.\nAnother example is a feature of most digital cameras called fill light, the ability to lighten up dark parts of a picture. On most cameras, you have an option to turn on the fill light while you're taking pictures. On the BF, fill light is something you adjust after the fact by editing the DNG, \"digital negative,\" or \"RAW,\" image in the camera.\nSigma's suggestion overall is to use color and filter adjustments to achieve a similar effect to fill light. In other words, the user interface consolidates traditional operations such as fill light and auto-exposure lock into a simpler set of choices that can be more centrally manipulated.\nAnd some things are just different. On the fp-L, and most cameras, when recording a video, you can take a still image as you're recording. On the BF, if you want a still image as well, you do it when replaying the video, by selecting \"save as JPEG.\"\nHow it performs with video\nSpeaking of video, I found the results were very satisfying. You can take 6K video (6,016 x 3,384) that looks great even without electronic stabilization turned on.\nI took this shot of a woman having her personal photo shoot in front of the Plaza Hotel. Although it's jerky and not cinematic, it was a wonderful spontaneous moment in great quality:\nWhen you turn on the electronic stabilization feature, video is reduced from 6K to \"ultra-high-def\" (3,840 x 2,160) because the camera needs to crop each frame to line up frames and make the shakiness disappear.\nIn a low-light setting, such as this video at Small's jazz club in Greenwich Village, I thought it produced a wonderful-looking film without a tripod.\nHere's where we see an example of the click-wheel at its best. I had the fun of rotating through the different color filters to change up the color from moment to moment while filming, something I would never do when color choices are a single button.\nAlthough my use of the feature is rather gimmicky here, I can see all kinds of possibilities with the click wheel, enabling new ways of controlling the camera during filming.\nLike all cameras, the sound you record with the built-in microphone video is never as good as if you had a dedicated mic attached, especially for something like music. But I thought the result here was very good in a space with challenging acoustics.\nAlso: This hidden Pixel camera setting gave my photos the pop they've been missing\nEven in low light, using the camera hand-held, you can get a nice video like this one taken in a darkened tango hall. In a dark place like a dance hall, with swaying bodies moving to and fro, with the camera in your hand and no stabilization turned on, it can be challenging to capture motion in a way that's satisfying. I love what the BF did with the color and the lights in this scene while managing to shift autofocus from one couple to the next:\nBattery life\nBattery life was fine for my purposes. I got as much as six hours of shooting on a single charge, including intermittent shooting and periods of intense activity. That meant in some cases over 500 exposures in DNG+JPEG format. That's better than the official specification by Sigma for approximately 260 images on a charge. Of course, your results may vary.\nIn my experience, plugging the BF into an iPad via USB-C for forty minutes will charge the camera from zero back to a third of its battery life. You can also bring along a spare battery and swap it in via the latched compartment on the bottom of the BF.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe complaints I've seen about the Sigma BF from seasoned photographers seem to be mostly about the reduction of controls to the click wheel and the mini-LCD. Consolidating controls in that way, they argue, robs the pro photographer of their muscle memory. Some pros also wish the touch screen did more to control the functions rather than just serving as a very good display.\nAlso: I tried Google's new agentic IDE, and it blows away the popular VS Code - here's how\nIn essence, pros have a hard time adjusting to a radically simplified UI. It's a fair point of view, but this is something of a Steve Jobs moment. You have to break a few eggs to make an omelette, and you may have to break habits to reinvent how photography is done.\nI think the BF is a terrific option for a beginning photographer or even an experienced pro. The touch-screen display is intuitive in a smartphone age, the electronics are just as fast as you'd expect based on smartphone picture-taking, and the output is very Instagram-worthy.\nAnd your envious friends will immediately want to know, What is that wild-looking camera you've got?"

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nI replaced my Samsung OLED TV with this Sony Mini LED model for a week - and didn't regret it\nSony Bravia 5 TV (98-inch)\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Enhanced color, contrast, and clarity make this TV live up to its hype.\n- It handily delivers upscaled HDR content and high-speed footage.\n- A soundbar will complement its size, and its off-angle viewing can be less than perfect.\nSony recently sent us the 2025 Bravia 5 TV, this one with a 98-inch screen and weighing in at 158 pounds. It goes without saying that this TV is a beast -- an expensive one. And the Bravia 5 is not even considered the company's flagship model (you can look to the Bravia 8 II and Bravia 9 for that). But this TV is impressive, and after testing it for a week, I'll explain why.\nAlso: You should turn off this default TV setting ASAP - and why even experts recommend it\nThe Bravia 5 is a Google TV, so setting up the UI was fairly easy using the remote and the Google Home app on my phone. But be prepared for a series of screens requiring you to check boxes for privacy disclaimers. The era of streaming content has become very complicated.\nOtherwise, the interface is intuitive, offering quick access to a vast selection of streaming services, apps, and voice control capabilities via Google Assistant. The personalization features are also a plus for helping you discover new content.\nThis behemoth of a display comes with a relatively small remote control. It's slender and lightweight, and if you have fat fingers like me, you might accidentally press enter when you meant to press a navigation button.\nAlso: Your TV's USB port has an underrated feature that can revitalize an old system for free\nI appreciate the downsizing of remotes across most brands these days. Yet despite all the streamlining, Sony (and most others) insist on including dedicated app buttons. You know, for Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and whatever other platforms the manufacturer contracts with. These buttons take up a lot of real estate and make the remote seem almost \"disposable\" because brands get bought, sold, and sometimes change names.\nFor example, I have a Roku TV with a Vudu button. Who or what is Vudu? That platform still exists, but it's now known as Fandango Media (a joint venture between NBC Universal and Warner Bros.).\nI don't mean to make an example of Sony; its engineers are simply abiding by the current trend. Yet, I haven't met anyone who says they use these dedicated app buttons. When you have a smartly designed home screen, you don't need them.\nThat is one of my two peevish critiques of the Sony Bravia 5. Second is the fact that this remote is not backlit. Come on, Sony. If I'm buying a $6,000 TV, I envision a home cinema experience in the dark (just like in a movie theatre). This means I don't want to turn on my phone to aim a light source at the \"magic wand\" just so I can pause the thing when my DoorDash order arrives. To me, backlighting on remotes seems like a simple ask for anything above a budget model television.\nApologies for my digressionary rant on remote control design. Despite these minor gripes, it became clear to me that the Bravia 5 has plenty to shout about.\nAlso: The next big HDMI leap has arrived - how the 2.2 standard is shaking things up\nFor one thing, Sony's prowess in display technology is impressive. Its proprietary Cognitive Processor XR upscales images beautifully, ensuring motion is slippery smooth with minimal blur. From fast-paced action scenes in the 2023 Mission: Impossible rendition to 2025 NBA highlights, the Bravia 5 delivered 4K resolution with exceptional clarity, vibrant colors, and impressive contrast. HDR content truly pops, showcasing deep blacks and brilliant highlights.\nWhile 4K content looks phenomenal, lower-resolution content (like older cable broadcasts) tends to reveal imperfections more noticeably on such a large screen, even with the XR processor's excellent upscaling.\nThe Sony Bravia 5 can display up to a 120Hz refresh rate with VRR and ALLM enabled, which means the TV dynamically adjusts to match the frame rate of the content being displayed. This is especially good news for gamers. With those kinds of specs, playing Fortnite on a display of this size is an electrifying experience. The Bravia 5 showed no sign of screen tearing, with exquisitely responsive gameplay.\nAlso: The best Sony TVs of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nAlready impressed by the images on this behemoth TV, I ran a few tests at the lab for dirty screen effect, burn-in, and blooming. I clocked no degradation, even close to the edges. The color test was consistent; the subtitle test yielded no visible blooming, and the scrolling text motion was liquid.\nHaving said that, viewing the Bravia 5 from side angles was not the best. It's fair to assume that, with the same build and technology in a smaller Bravia 5, this would also be the case. With a 98-inch screen, though, you probably won't get many complaints from someone sitting on the far edge of your couch. And while Sony TVs generally handle reflections well, a screen this large can still be susceptible to glare in brightly lit rooms, so strategic placement and light control are important factors. (You might consider getting some blackout curtains.)\nAlso: I changed 12 settings on my Apple TV to instantly improve the performance\nThis Mini LED TV bears a peak brightness of around 800 nits. That isn't eye-popping OLED-level brightness, but in a dark room, you might want to lower the brightness on a Bravia 5 to prevent eye strain. Trust me, the TV is plenty bright, and it can accommodate seating from any conceivable home theater.\nWhat about sound? The Sony Bravia 5 uses Sony's Acoustic Multi-Audio system, and it's worth some praise. It combines two down-firing X-Balanced speakers for bass and midrange with a pair of Sound Positioning tweeters on the top corners of the back panel to handle mids and highs. The result is a well-balanced listening experience, with clear dialogue and vocals complemented by ambient effects that fill the space nicely.\nFor the ultimate audio experience, though, the Sony Bravia 5 could use a companion soundbar to round things out. Again, if you're investing this much in a giant screen, then your budget might not be too far stretched to install a comprehensive surround sound system as well.\nAlso: This is the soundbar I recommend for deeply immersive audio - and now it's $300 off\nThe Bravia 5 has an impressive array of connectivity options, including Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 on the wireless side, and several physical ports. I really like how Sony included an infographic panel (of sorts) right next to each port to make it clear which cables go where. It comes with four HDMI ports -- one of them eARC (for that soundbar you should buy), another being 4K at 120Hz (for your online gaming needs).\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe 98-inch Sony Bravia 5 is a formidable piece of home entertainment technology. Its stunning picture quality, immersive scale, and excellent smart features make it a dream display for any cinephile or gaming enthusiast.\nGrand proportions notwithstanding, Sony's quality will shine through on any smaller-sized Bravia 5 screen. This one runs for about $5,999, whereas you can get an 85-inch Bravia 5 for less than half that price or a 75-inch for one-third the cost.\nEven if it's not about the money, not every home can accommodate a colossal 98-inch panel. So, if your home's parameters aren't suitable for something this big, you'll arguably be getting a better value by downsizing a step or two on screen size.\nIf you have the budget and space, the Bravia 5 delivers on its promise of a magnificent viewing experience. And if you're seeking the ultimate home cinema experience, pair this TV with a high-end soundbar to match the visual grandeur with equally powerful and nuanced audio.\nHow we test TVs\nWhile testing and researching the TVs featured on this list, I and other ZDNET experts kept these criteria in mind:\n- Price: Not all budgets are created equal. And if you're working with a limited budget, that shouldn't mean you have to settle for a sub-par TV.\n- Screen size: The most important factor to consider, after price, when shopping for a new TV is whether or not it will fit into your space.\n- Picture and audio quality: A new TV doesn't mean much, even if it costs an arm and a leg, if it doesn't provide a great picture and clear audio. The best TVs we test have often been ensured to support various HDR codecs, including HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, as well as enhanced audio software like Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus, and object-tracking sound.\nFor a more detailed look, check out our extensive TV testing methodology."

But the control can be challenging to operate, especially if you're used to swiping and tapping the on-screen settings to take a photo.\nAlso: My new favorite iPhone accessory makes shooting professional videos so much easier\nI've been trying the Camera Control for the past few weeks, using it to shoot photos and videos out and about. There's definitely a learning curve. You have to figure out how to access each setting and apply the right press or tap to activate it. You also need to understand how adjusting the exposure, depth of field, style, and tone will affect your photo -- and which of these elements you should use and when.\nI'm still trying to get used to the control to determine whether I prefer it over the standard on-screen camera settings. If you're struggling with the control as well, here are 12 tips that should make it easier to use.\nHow to use Camera Control on the iPhone 16\n1. Double click to activate the camera\nBy default, pressing once on the Camera Control opens the Camera app. That's a quick and easy way to take a photo. But you may find yourself accidentally hitting the control when you don't want to use the camera. In that case, you can change the action to a double click.\nGo to Settings, select Camera, and then tap Camera Control. In the Launch Camera section, check the option for Double Click and then see if double pressing the control works better for you.\n2. Turn off Clean Preview\nLightly pressing or double pressing the Camera Control with the Camera app open lets you cycle through the different settings and adjust them as you prefer. But as you do this, the onscreen settings in the Camera app disappear due to a Clean Preview option. The idea is to present you with a clear and unobstructed view of your subject. But you might prefer to have access to those on-screen settings to adjust them the usual way. In that case, simply turn off Clean Preview.\nAlso: My iPhone's battery life has been terrible on iOS 18 - and I'm not alone\nHead to Settings, select Camera, and then tap Camera Control. In the Light Press section, turn off the switch for Clean Preview. The next time you use the Camera Control, notice that the on-screen settings remain visible.\n3. Pick a different app\nBy default, the Camera Control triggers the built-in Camera app. That's fine. But maybe you'd like to activate a different app. Perhaps you use a third-party camera app that you prefer or would like to take a photo through a social media app like Instagram or Snapchat. No problem.\nAgain, go to Settings, select Camera, and then tap Camera Control. The bottom section displays a list of camera programs and related apps installed on your iPhone. Tap the one you'd like to use. The next time you press the Camera control, your chosen app will pop up.\nAlso: Every iPhone model that will support Apple's upcoming AI features\nThe settings that appear when you press or double-press the control will vary based on the app. On my iPhone, the Obscura camera app gives me access to settings for exposure, zoom, filter, focus, and format. The ProCamera app lets me control the exposure and zoom. And the Halide app provides access to lock, exposure, and focus settings.\n4. Adjust the pressure for light pressing the Camera Control\nWith the Camera app open, light pressing the Camera Control once takes you to the last setting you used, such as exposure or depth of field. Light pressing it twice takes you to a list of all the settings -- Exposure, Depth of Field, Zoom, Styles, and Tone. After you rest on a specific setting, light pressing the control again lets you adjust that setting. But if you're having trouble getting your light presses to work properly, you may want to adjust the pressure.\nGo to Settings and select Accessibility. In the Physical and Motor section, tap Camera Control. The Camera Control screen offers three levels of pressure -- Lighter, Default, and Normal. Initially, I found that even the default option failed to register a lot of my light presses, which is why I changed it to Lighter. Your mileage may vary, so play around with the three levels to see which works best for you.\n5. Adjust the pressure for double light pressing the Camera Control\nLight pressing the Camera Control twice displays all the settings you can adjust. But that's another action that may not always register correctly. In that case, you can modify the pressure.\nAlso: How to use your iPhone's emergency satellite features if you lose cell coverage\nGo to Settings, select Accessibility, and tap Camera Control. Swipe to the bottom of the screen to the section for Double Light-Press Speed. Change the level from Default to Slow or Slower to see if the double light presses are more accurate. Switching it from Default to Slow did the trick for me.\n6. Shoot a video\nPressing the Camera Control once with the Camera app open takes a still photo. But you can also use the control to shoot a video. Simply press down on the control until the red shutter button appears at the bottom and the timer appears at the top. When you're done, release the control, and your video is saved to your library.\n7. Control the exposure\nYou use the exposure setting to lighten or darken the scene. The EV, or exposure value, is a number that represents the shutter speed and the aperture to determine how much light reaches the lens. The more light, the brighter the scene; the less light, the darker the scene.\nAlso: My biggest regret with updating my iPhone to iOS 18\nTo access this with the Camera app open, double-press the Camera Control and swipe up on the control until you see Exposure. Press once to adjust the exposure and then slide your finger up and down on the control, moving between -2 EV to darken the scene and 2 EV to lighten the scene. Beyond increasing the exposure to compensate for a low-light scene, consider keeping certain shots darker to make them more interesting or mysterious.\n8. Control the depth of field\nUse the depth of field setting to determine how sharp the surrounding area of a scene is versus the subject of the photo. The higher the depth of field, the more the entire scene is in focus. The lower the depth of field, the more the background or surrounding area is out of focus compared with the subject. Here, you're actually adjusting the F stop to increase or decrease the aperture of the lens.\nIn the Camera app, double press the Camera control and then swipe toward the top until you see Depth. Press once and then slide your finger on the control. In a dark environment, you may need to use a lower depth of field to keep the subject of the photo in focus. In a scene with ample light, the depth of field may automatically get set to a higher number. But you might find a photo with a lower depth of field and the background somewhat blurry more interesting than one that's entirely in focus.\n9. Control the zoom\nThe zoom setting simply zooms in and out of the subject. You'll need to zoom in to capture a faraway subject or scene and zoom out to capture a larger area. Again, double press the Camera control and swipe until you see Zoom. Press once and slide your finger along the control to zoom in and out.\n10. Choose a style\nThe styles setting applies a specific color temperature to your photo. You can choose among such styles as stark black & white, muted black & white, ethereal, cozy, quite, dramatic, luminous, natural, vibrant, standard, amber, gold, rose gold, neutral, and cool rose.\nAlso: Why I'm recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year\nDouble press the Camera control and swipe until you see Styles. Press once and slide your finger along the control to see how the different styles affect the look and mood of the photo.\n11. Set the tone\nThe tone setting controls the amount of shadowing in your photos, another way to lighten or darken the scene. Double press the Camera control and swipe to the bottom until you see Tone. Press once and slide your finger on the control to explore the various levels. Moving from 1 to -1, you can add or subtract shadows in your screen to create a dramatic effect.\n12. Turn off the Camera Control\nFinally, if you decide you just don't like the Camera Control, you can easily turn it off. Go to Settings, select Accessibility, and tap Camera Control. To disable the ability to adjust the settings by light pressing the control, turn off the switch for Show Adjustments. To disable the Camera Control completely, turn off the switch for Camera Control."
