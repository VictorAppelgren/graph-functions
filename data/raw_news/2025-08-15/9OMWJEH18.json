  "title": "Amazon Password Warning\u2014Delete All These Texts On Your Phone",
  "description": "Do not give hackers access to your account.",
  "content": "The latest password attacks targeting Amazon customers are now soaring. And while the retail giant has confirmed to me that 320 million users have upgraded the security on their accounts to better defend against these hacks, millions are still at risk.\n\nProofpoint has just warned that such SMS-based attacks are out of control. \u201cSmishing campaigns jumped 2,534%, with over half of SMS phishing messages containing malicious URLs, reflecting a major shift toward mobile-first targeting.\u201d\n\nThe latest text message attacks making headlines (1,2,3) pretend to be from Amazon. The message includes a link to a fake login page designed to steal your username and password, which then lets the hackers gain access to your account.\n\nThe lure is the promise of a refund for a product you have recently purchased, you just need to click on the link to confirm you want you money back \u2014 you don\u2019t even need to return the product. Who doesn\u2019t want free money, the attackers assume.\n\nAccording to Guardio, the drafting of the texts has just changed, with more specific phrasing. And those texts are flying. The security firm saw a near 1000% surge in just two days. Remember, these text scams are an industry pumping out billions of texts each year. The hit rate can be very low and still highly lucrative.\n\nAmazon says \u201cscammers that attempt to impersonate Amazon put consumers at risk. We will continue to invest in protecting consumers and educating the public on scam avoidance. We encourage consumers to report suspected scams to us so that we can protect their accounts and refer bad actors to law enforcement.\u201d\n\nWisconsin state officials are the latest to warn of this new wave of Amazon attacks. \"Just click a link, complete a form that goes to a fake Amazon website where your personal information and financial information will be collected,\" the state tells its citizens.\u201d\n\nThe FBI warns all smartphone users to delete these malicious texts from their devices. While the domains and links are often only live for a day, you don\u2019t want dangerous links lurking on your phone, even if you\u2019re certain you won\u2019t mistakenly click.\n\nAmazon has told me that \u201cwe encourage customers to use two-step verification and Passkeys to help protect their accounts.\u201d You should do that as soon as you can. The company says 320 million customers have already added passkeys to their account, and they encourage all others to do the same. These protect against password attacks, as a passkey only works on your own devices.\n\nWhile the refund texts are claiming victims they\u2019re not difficult to detect. As Amazon warns, \u201ctext messages that contain phishing links with URLs that are misspelled, have typos, or have a link that is an IP address\u201d are not genuine. The URLs in these refund texts are clearly not Amazon addresses and must not be clicked.\n\nDelete every one of these messages on your phone.",

Now they\u2019re posing as the online retailer to try to hijack your account and steal your money.\nIt starts with a text warning that an item you bought has either been recalled or failed a \u201croutine quality check.\u201d The text offers you a full refund, and you don\u2019t even need to visit the website or app to claim it. Simply click the provided link and log in as usual.\nYou\u2019re taken to a site that looks completely legitimate. You log in and provide the financial information needed to process your refund. However, the site\u2019s a clever fake, and you\u2019ve just been smished. Smishing involves scams sent via text message, and they\u2019re becoming increasingly common.\nTo avoid getting smished, never click on links sent via text from unknown sources. If you get a text claiming to come from Amazon, verify the information provided through the company\u2019s official website or app. And be sure to report any suspicious texts or emails to the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) or the Federal Trade Commission.\nCopyright 2025 KVVU.

      "text": "It\u2019s an easy lure. Attackers use \u201csocial media and other messaging platforms,\u201d to pose as lawyers, offering to help anyone who has lost crypto to scams recover their funds. These fake lawyers claim to have case files from the FBI and other agencies. Victims are then defrauded again, with more money lost to these malicious recovery schemes.\nThe bureau first warned about this scam in 2023 and then again in 2024. Now there\u2019s a third public advisory, which \u201cprovides additional red flag indicators and due diligence measures to help victims who have been in contact with fictitious law firms.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, these frauds target vulnerable citizens, \u201cparticularly the elderly,\u201d and \u201cexploit victims\u2019 emotional state and financial need to recover funds.\u201d Some of the attacks impersonate legitimate law firms adding to their credibility.\nSpecific red flags to watch for include stating affiliation or official partnership with government or regulatory agencies. \u201cThere are no law firms which are officially authorized partners of U.S. Government agencies,\u201d the FBI confirms.\nThese frauds may also list \u201cfictitious government or regulatory entities,\u201d albeit much of the documentation and references they use are real.\nMore pointedly, scammers need to be paid and will \u201crequest payment in cryptocurrency or prepaid gift cards\u201d or ask victims to open new overseas bank accounts for the recovered funds. They will \u201csay that payment of bank fees is required to verify identity and ownership to withdraw funds\u201d or \u201csend payment to a third-party entity (i.e., xyz trading company) for the supposed purposes of maintaining secrecy and safety.\u201d\nSet out here in black and white, it\u2019s easy to see these scams for what they are. But for more vulnerable investors or for those emotionally affected by the original thefts, it\u2019s all too easy to jump at the chance of any form of recovery.\nThe FBI suggests a \"Zero Trust\" model, which means trust no one and assume everything is a scam until proven otherwise. \u201cEvery request should be verified.\u201d There is other advice to confirm law licenses and to keep records of contacts. But you should never respond to unsolicited posts such as this, which means never getting that far.\n\u201cBe wary of advertisements for cryptocurrency recovery services,\u201d the FBI says. And \u201cif an unknown individual contacts you and claims to be able to recover stolen crypto, do not release any financial or personal identifying information and do not send money.\u201d\nWith billions of dollars lost to online crypto hacks and scams, there are plenty of victims to target. The fact there have now been three FBI warnings on this highlights the risks."
