      "summary": "Consumer sentiment fell to 58.2 in August from 61.7 in July, reflecting heightened inflation worries and a decline in durable‑goods buying conditions. Year‑ahead inflation expectations rose to 4.8% and long‑run expectations to 3.5%, while core PCE inflation hit 2.9% in July, staying above the Fed’s 2% target. The BLS will release August jobs data next week, with markets anticipating a modest rise in unemployment and 92,500 new non‑farm jobs. Fed officials signal a possible rate cut in September, though political pressure and tariff concerns may temper easing.\n",
