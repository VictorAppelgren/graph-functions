      "title": "Jealous of Duolingo’s Social Media? The Strategist Behind It Just Shared Advice for Brands",
      "summary": "Zaria Parvez, Duolingo’s former sole social‑media manager, drove the brand’s explosive growth from 300,000 to 4.6 million Instagram followers and 16.7 million TikTok followers, turning the company into a cultural icon through unhinged, character‑driven content. Her departure follows a record‑breaking quarter of 41 % revenue growth and highlights her belief that brands should focus on rapid approval, creative autonomy, and a willingness to fail rather than copying mascots. Parvez advises companies to invest in slow‑burn, serialized storytelling that builds lasting communities, and warns that social media should not replace genuine community engagement. The article also includes a heartfelt LinkedIn farewell, fan tributes, and a brief overview of the Link In Bio newsletter that interviews social media leaders and offers strategy insights. ",
