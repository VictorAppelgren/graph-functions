  "description": "If you've already got a Ryobi string trimmer but need a leaf blower to keep your lawn clean, then the Ryobi Expand-It attachment is what you need.",
  "content": "The Ryobi Expand-It Attachment That Turns Your String Trimmer Into A Leaf Blower\n\nAn attachment that turns your string trimmer into a leaf blower capable of moving 475 cubic feet of air per minute at speeds up to 140 mph is easily one of the most useful attachments from Ryobi's Expand-It system. According to Ryobi's website, the 475 CFM Blower Attachment, which weighs just under five pounds, comes with a handy hanger cap to simplify storage solutions when not in use. While the Ryobi Expand-It blower attachment, model RYAXA22, is designed to work with Ryobi's line of 40V Attachment Capable Power Heads and String Trimmers and ONE+ Attachment Capable String Trimmers, it also works with gas and cordless attachment capable trimmers from several brands, including Hart, Kobalt, Weed Eater, Cub Cadet, Craftsman, Poulan, Toro, and McCulloch to name a few. However, Ryobi Expand-It attachments and Milwaukee's Quik-Lok system are not compatible. The Home Depot, an exclusive retailer for Ryobi-brand products, sells the Expand-It blower attachment for $99.00. While prices can fluctuate between Home Depot and Ryobi's website, in this case, the price is the same. Home Depot offers free in-store pickup, or you can buy online and get free delivery right to your location. However, quantities are limited to one unit per order.\n\nRyobi lists about a dozen different Expand-It attachments on its website. They include power sweepers, pole saws, hedge trimmers, cultivators, edgers, brush cutters, gutter blowers, string trimmers, and snow blowers in addition to the leaf blower attachment. If the Expand-It leaf blower doesn't provide enough power to remove the dirt and debris that accumulates on your driveway or patio, there are a couple of Ryobi Expand-It attachment options to consider. First, the Expand-It Sweeper attachment is capable of removing a 15-inch-wide swath of dirt, damp leaves, and other light debris from hard surfaces. It's listed on Home Depot's, as well as Ryobi's, website for $179.00. If your cleanup chores involve removing heavier debris from hard surfaces and grass, consider the Ryobi Expand-It Rubber Broom attachment, Home Depot priced at $199.00. The rubber broom attachment features rubber paddles with a 15.5-inch cleaning width. Cleaning gutters is often a dreaded fall chore. If you'd like to clean your gutters with both feet planted firmly on the ground this fall, check out the $79.00 Expand-It Gutter Blower attachment, also available at Home Depot. Ryobi describes the attachment as capable of clearing leaves and debris from high gutters with the tool extending to 9.5 feet. However, users say Ryobi's Gutter Blower works best with dry leaves and can struggle to remove wet debris from gutters.\n\nAmong the things you should know about Ryobi's Expand-It attachment system is that it provides a way to own several outdoor power tools at budget prices and store them in a smaller space. While you could buy any of the tools that the Ryobi Expand-It attachment system offers as full-size gas or battery-powered options, they would cost more and often take up more space. The key is that the Expand-It system can use a single powerhead, acquired as a stand-alone unit or as part of an Attachment Capable String Trimmer; it doesn't even have to be Ryobi brand. Using the $99.00 Expand-It 475 CFM Blower Attachment as an example, Home Depot's least expensive comparable blower is the DeWalt 20V MAX 125 mph 450 CFM Brushless Cordless Handheld Leaf Blower that comes as a \"Tool Only\" version for $125.00. The Ryobi Expand-it Attachment System is easy to use. Using the tool-free system, users can quickly swap from one attachment to another. It's easy to change to the Expand-It edger after using the string trimmer attachment. Then use the sweeper attachment followed by the blower for professional-looking results.",

      "text": "Does Ryobi's Gutter Blower Work? Here's What Users Say\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nRyobi's 18V and 40V power systems allow homeowners to build a more efficient tool collection using interchangeable batteries and chargers \u2014 that way, you only need one or two batteries for your cordless tools, saving invaluable space in your shed or garage. The manufacturer takes this idea even further with its Ryobi Expand-It Attachment system, which doesn't just let you use multiple tools with a single battery, but also allows you to use multiple tools with a single motor. That means you can build out an entire tool kit with just a single battery, charger, and power head if you wanted to.\nThe Ryobi-It Expand it system includes over 10 different attachments, including a string trimmer, snow thrower, cultivator, and snow thrower. You can use these attachments with either 18V or 40V power heads, though for landscaping equipment, you'll likely want to opt for the more powerful 40V motor, which is available in both brushed steel and high-performance brushless models. Many homeowners will typically buy a particular Ryobi tool kit that comes with the power head and attachment, such as Ryobi's hedge trimmer, as it's usually cheaper than buying the head and attachment separately. Once you have the head, you can then start adding other compatible tools to your kit.\nOne outdoor Ryobi tool to help maintain your property is the Ryobi Expand-It Gutter Blower, which is designed to quickly clear debris as it slides along your gutters. It has an air speed of up to 145 mph and air volume up to 185 cfm, and can extend 9.5 feet with two included extension poles. But is Ryobi's gutter blower actually useful? Here's a closer look at what people who've used it have to say.\nUsers find Ryobi's gutter blower to be powerful and convenient\nGutters easily collect leaves, dirt, twigs from old birds' nests, and other debris that keep them from working properly. Cleaning them can be a hassle, especially if you don't have access to your roof, which, in theory, makes the extension poles and overhead capability of Ryobi's gutter blower so useful. In a video review of the product, YouTube channel Mother Daughter Projects appears to confirm this theory, concluding after a test run of the product that \"if you have messy gutters and are not able to access your roof, this might be the tool for you.\"\nAnother glowing review that suggests the gutter blower is one of the Ryobi tools that every home landscaper could use comes from the subreddit r/Ryobi. The TLDR of the post is \"Amazing\" and \"exceeded expectations.\" The user goes on to say, \"This thing is powerful. Blower was able to get out every single leaf (except one) from the gutter. Keep in mind these were WET and HEAVY leaves.\"\nOn Home Depot's website, over 100 users have given the gutter blower a very good \u2014 but not amazing \u2014 4 out of 5 average customer score, though more than half of the reviews are 5 out of 5 stars. One user points out that not needing to use a ladder means the tool lets you \"keep your feet on the ground and clean your gutters from a much safer position.\" Another similar review states, \"So much easier to use than having to move a ladder every couple of feet!\" Many other users highlight the tool's convenience when it comes to not needing a ladder, as well as its strong blowing power. One 5-star review puts it plainly: \"I feel it is well worth the money.\"\nSome users say Ryobi's gutter blower is heavy and struggles with wet leaves\nWhile reviews of Ryobi's gutter blower are generally positive, two specific issues come up repeatedly as you see what users have to say about the tool. One is that the product is heavy, which makes it harder to use, considering you need to hold it over your head. (The gutter attachment adds 4.88 pounds to the power head and battery.) One Home Depot customer describes the tool as \"cumbersome;\" another, \"awkward and a bit heavy.\" An older user says the tool is \"well built,\" but \"it was too heavy for me to handle.\"\nEven the dedicated glowing review on r/Ryobi says that the tool is \"Fairly heavy. You're able to easily maneuver it along the gutter, but had to take a quick break every 15-20 feet.\" The redditor also mentions that the \"You do have to go over the area a few times\" because the tool doesn't always clear gutters on a single pass, especially when the debris is wet and heavier. This is the second common complaint that comes up in reviews of the product. The YouTube channel Mother Daughter Projects found that while the tool cleared most of their gutters, it did leave some debris.\nSeveral Home Depot users suggest the blower struggles with wet leaves. One review says, \"The dryer the debris the better,\" while another states, \"Blows okay, but doesn't work on wet leaves (not that I expected it to).\" Some users mention that leaves blown onto the roof are just going to clog their gutters again: \"It also couldn't get the pine cones out defeating the purpose of buying this product. Also half of the leaves head to the roof meaning they'll go back in the gutter.\""

      "text": "5 Of The Most Useful Ryobi Expand-It Attachments (According To Users)\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nRyobi is a popular brand due to its affordability and easy accessibility, as it's a Home Depot-exclusive name. While the prices are low, the company has plenty of quality products, and the Expand-It line offers versatility that's hard to match from other companies. Instead of buying a dedicated pole saw, you can opt for one that's part of Ryobi's Expand-It line that attaches directly to your 40V attachment power head to transform it into something that can cut branches.\nThere are plenty of products that fit this bill from Ryobi, and instead of digging through them all to find out what's good and what's not, you can hear from owners about what the best picks are. You'll find people gravitate toward things that can make otherwise mundane jobs like cleaning out a gutter much easier and efficient. Nobody wants to buy something that ends up being useless or a dud, so everything on this list is backed up by high user scores, good word of mouth, or both. A more in-depth explanation of how these items were picked can be found at the end.\nRyobi Expand-It 10-inch Universal Pole Saw Attachment\nThe pole saw Expand-It attachment is available at Home Depot for $129, and it's one of the handiest tools you can buy from the line. It has a maximum length of 9.5 feet, so the 10-inch blade is able to hit high branches without having to break out a ladder, which is a huge benefit of going for this tool. There are many people on the Ryobi subreddit who recommend going for the Expand-It attachment over a standalone pole saw due to the length. Ryobi says the tool can cut through 8 inches, so don't be afraid to try it on branches you might think it has no chance of cutting.\nThis attachment has a 4.5 out of five score on Home Depot's website based on more than 3,000 reviews. It's clear it's a well-liked attachment from buyers, but some reviewers note it could come defective. The pole saw attachment comes with a three-year limited warranty that has you covered in case something like that happens. There's also a 90-day return policy included with the initial purchase.\nRyobi Expand-It 140 MPH 475 CFM Universal Axial Blower Attachment\nIf you don't want to buy a dedicated leaf blower, then you can opt for an Expand-It blower from Home Depot for $99. It can blow up to 140 mph, a speed Ryobi says is good for light use like dry leaves. This means it's not the greatest for getting wet leaves out of your lawn or gutter, but if you need to clear out your yard or patio it's a fine fit. Like you'll see with most Ryobi products, this blower attachment comes with a three-year manufacturer's warranty in case you have problems.\nUser scores for the attachment come in at 4.7 out of five on Home Depot's website. With 2,000 reviews and counting, it's clear the blower has a lot of fans. For light lawn work, it's a solid tool, but a two-star review of the product note it's heavy and cumbersome to move around with. This could be a problem if you're working in a big area, but for cleaning off your patio it'll be fine.\nRyobi Expand-It Gutter Blower Attachment\nTrying to clean your gutter can be a very annoying process, especially if you need to lean a ladder up against your house. Instead of doing that, you can pick up the gutter blower attachment from Home Depot for $129. While it looks a lot like a desk fan attached to a pole, owners of the attachment speak highly of its quality. Reddit user cscswimmer227 says it's powerful enough to clear out wet and heavy leaves from a gutter.\nDon't take it from just one buyer, as it also has a 4.4 out of five user score on Home Depot's website. Reviewers note it's possible to reach 16 foot tall gutters with the attachment, so you don't need a ladder at all to clean your gutter with this. This makes it safer as you're still on the ground, and it makes the job go faster and smoother. One downside of it could be the fact you don't clean your gutters out very often, so it could take a while before you ultimately get your money's worth from it.\nRyobi Expand-It 18-inch Universal Hedge Trimmer Attachment\nIf you don't already have a dedicated hedge trimmer, you can pick up one from the Expand-It line for $99. Doing this will make trimming your bushes and hedges a breeze, and it's cheaper than buying a dedicated trimmer \u2014 although you have to own a string trimmer to attach this tool to in the first place. At 18 inches long, the hedge trimmer attachment can cut 3/4-inch thick branches, so it can handle most of your common landscaping.\nOn Home Depot's website, the trimmer attachment has a 4.5 out of five user score. What gives this a big edge over an actual trimmer is the fact that it is an expansion. The regular trimmer can only reach as far as your arm goes, while the Expand-It attachment can reach taller areas since it's attaching to a string trimmer or whatever Expand-It-compatible tool you have. If you have any issues with the purchase, you're backed by a three-year manufacturer's warranty from Ryobi.\nRyobi Expand-It 8-inch Universal Straight Shaft Edger Attachment\nLandscaping requires a lot of tools, and if you're looking to save cash where you can, the Ryobi Expand-It line is a good way to do it. The universal straight shaft edger attachment is available from Home Depot for $99. This makes the area around your sidewalks, curbs, and pathway leading to your front door a lot tidier, and it's clear people are very happy with the purchase. It features an 8-inch double-edge blade that lets you extend the life of the blade.\nWith more than 4,700 reviews on Home Depot's website, the attachment has a 4.6 out of five score. It's easily one of the most popular attachments in the line, but that doesn't mean it's not without its downsides. Some reviewers note the plastic guard is fragile and could end up becoming a safety hazard. As is the case with situations like this, your mileage may vary. If you do have a problem, you're backed by Ryobi's three-year warranty.\nWhy were these five attachments picked?\nEach attachment on this list has good user scores and people talk highly of them on social media. On top of that, everything's readily available from Home Depot, so you won't have any issue tracking them down and buying them at a store nearby. The Expand-It line is growing, so it can be tough to keep track of what's good and what's not. The good news is there's nothing that's outright useless, but its clear people have gravitated to certain attachments thanks to their uses. If you find something you want that isn't on the list, that doesn't automatically mean it's bad, it just means we couldn't spotlight everything.\nIf you do have problems with any of these tools, you can file a Ryobi warranty claim as well as taking advantage of Home Depot's return policy. Given the user scores for each product listed \u2014 four or higher in all situations \u2014 your chances are good you won't run into something."

      "text": "Is It Cheaper To Buy Ryobi Tools From Its Website Or Home Depot?\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nRyobi is one of the biggest tool brands around, and has just about any tool you could need for any job. While won't find any Ryobi tools at Lowe's, they're not difficult to find.\nThe most obvious choice is the Ryobi website. Granted, you do need to pay for shipping and wait for your tools to arrive, but at least you're getting them from the source. Alternatively, hardware giant Home Depot is a great place to get Ryobi tools. It has a wide selection and brick-and-mortar locations, so you can get your tools as soon as you need them, while avoiding shipping costs. As far as what tools will cost from these two sources, however, there's no guarantee that one will always be cheaper than the other.\nLooking over the Ryobi website and the shelves of Home Depot, Ryobi tools tend to vary in price. If you want the cheapest option, you'll have to consider which tools you need to find the cheaper retailer.\nPrice points fluctuate between Ryobi's website and Home Depot\nIf you want to fill out your Ryobi tool collection fast, a tool kit could be a great buy. In this case, Home Depot is likely your best bet price-wise. Not only is the kit selection wider, but they're often on sale or generally priced lower than their Ryobi listing. For instance, the ONE+ 18-volt two-tool combo kit, ONE+ 18V cordless 12-tool combo kit, and ONE+ 18V cordless drill and impact driver kit are all currently listed at significantly lower prices than their Ryobi website equivalents. Granted, those that are on discount aren't always guaranteed to be at that rate for long, so it's a good idea to jump on such deals while you can.\nAs far as individual tools go, there's a bit more inconsistency. Looking at smaller hand tools such as drills and sanders, there's not much deviation between the two tool sources, but there are some cases where checking both sites is a good idea. Case in point: the 18V ONE+ Airstrike 16-gauge nailer. Ryobi has it listed for $179 on sale, while Home Depot has it listed for $199. There can be discrepancies with larger tools as well, with the 40V backpack blower set \u2014 not to be confused with Ryobi's gas-powered leaf blowers \u2014 costing $429 at Home Depot while Ryobi has it for $329 on sale. To reiterate, though, these sales won't last forever, so keep this in mind while shopping.\nAt the end of the day, all one can really do is check both the Home Depot and Ryobi website listings for the tools they want to ensure they're getting the best rate possible.\nTrying to save money beyond Home Depot and Ryobi can get risky\nWhile it's not impossible to find a deal on Ryobi tools, the brand's website and Home Depot might still leave you a bit light in the wallet. As a result, other, potentially cheaper sources, such as Amazon or the Walmart website, might seem ideal to build out your Ryobi arsenal. While this might seem like a great way to get a deal from a reputable retailer, they may not have the best selection. Compared to the other negatives, though, this isn't too big of a deal.\nAt the end of the day, Ryobi is technically a Home Depot exclusive brand, having been so since 2000. As a result, the likes of Amazon and Walmart don't technically carry the brand's products in an official capacity. Rather, third-party sellers go through their websites to sell their goods, and while they can be trustworthy, not all of them are. Thus, if you buy Ryobi from them, there's a chance the quality could lack, parts could be missing, and other negatives could present themselves. Not to mention, they may not come with one of Ryobi's warranties, so if something goes wrong, you can't turn to the brand for help.\nThe history of Ryobi tools reveals decent-quality tools sold at competitive prices. They may get expensive through Home Depot and the Ryobi website, but deals can be had, and sometimes, it's worth paying a little more than taking a risk on the product."

      "text": "Everything To Know About Ryobi's Expand-It Attachment System\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nSpring is around the corner, and that means lawn maintenance is about to be well underway. There are several tools that you can use to keep your yard looking good. For example, Ryobi's chemical sprayers can help keep your yard bug-free, which will come in handy if you're trying to spend more time outside.\nHowever, having to buy separate Ryobi tools for difficult types of yard work can get a bit cumbersome, especially when the bulkiness starts taking up space in your home garage or backyard shed. That's when having a multitool can come in handy. Ryobi has created an attachment system much like Milwaukee's Quik-Lok attachment system that allows you to use the same head unit but switch out the tool itself. It's important to note that some of the attachments discussed in this article are still listed as coming soon as of February 2024, but they are scheduled to be released in the coming months, just in time for spring yard cleanup.\nWhat to know about Ryobi's Expand-It attachments\nRyobi's Expand-It attachment system is a revolutionary design made up of landscaping tools that all attach to the 40V Attachment Power Head. This style of design is incredibly efficient due to the ability to save on space and money. Unlike other attachment systems, you can buy the power head separately if you need more than one, like if you and your partner want to use the attachments simultaneously to get the yard work done quicker. It comes with a variable speed trigger, so you'll have multiple controls for whichever tool you have attached to it.\nThere are many Expand-It attachments available, and each one has at least a 4.2 out of five stars from users due to the tool's usability and efficiency. Additionally, switching out the tools is incredibly easy. Safety tip \u2014 make sure to remove the battery before installing or removing the attachment to lower the chance of accidentally hurting yourself. To remove an attachment, loosen the coupler on the power head's shaft and press and hold down the attachment's lock button. From there, you'll be able to easily pull the attachment out. To install an attachment, do the same steps in the other direction.\nMost useful Expand-It attachments\nWhen looking at Ryobi's yard maintenance tools and the Expand-It system, you would expect to see attachments like the string trimmer and hedge trimmer because these types of tools tend to be at the top of the must-have outdoor power tools list. However, there are a few others that many homeowners would find useful while doing their yard chores.\nThe 10-inch Pruner Attachment comes with a 10-inch bar and chain that works great, cutting limbs up to 6 inches thick. To make the jobs easier, it has an angled cutting head and an automatic oiler. It also comes with an extension shaft, so you can reach up to 12 feet to cut those harder-to-reach branches. The 8-inch Brush-Cutter Trimmer Attachment is great for getting to the overgrown weeds and stalks that are trying to take over your yard. It comes with an 8-inch die tri-arc blade made of heavy-grade steel and a straight shelf configuration, which will give you enough reach to get the job done at a safe distance.\nLastly, the 8-inch Universal Straight Shaft Edger Attachment is the tool you'll want to create perfect edges anywhere in your yard. It has an 8-inch double-edge steel blade with a large guide wheel for more control and stability. You can also adjust the height for custom edges to give your yard the perfect taste of curb appeal.\nMost clever Expand-It attachments\nWhile all of the attachments within the system have their purpose, some of them are more clever than others due to them filling in a need some didn't know they had. Ryobi has a line of snow machines to help clear the snow off of decks and driveways, and the Expand-It system has found its way into the line. The 12-inch Snow Thrower Attachment has a remove-and-throw 12-inch clearing width and 6-inch clearing depth. It's ideal for removal on sidewalks and decks along with driveways. However, it's best used with just snow. If ice finds its way into the mix, it can be more difficult to chop up and remove.\nThe Rubber Sweeper Attachment is a great addition to your Expand-it arsenal. You can easily sweep away dirt, mulch, and other hard-to-remove debris from hard surfaces and grass using rubber paddles. Though there are other clever attachments, another incredibly innovative one is the Gutter Blower Attachment. Gone are the days when you need to climb on your roof to clean your gutter of leaves and other debris. Ryobi's gutter blower can extend up to 9.5 feet and blow up to 145 MPH. It even works when the debris is wet or dry, which is convenient when dealing with those wet spring days.\nRyobi Expand-It disadvantages\nLike most things, when there are positive aspects to a product, there are usually some negative ones as well. Most reviews on the attachments are good. However, one that frequently comes up in negative comments is that the attachment sometimes comes loose due to only having one connector button, even though the handle has three holes.\nAnother disadvantage is the weight of the battery. The Expand-It system works with a 40V battery, which is quite large. Depending on which amp-hour battery you purchase will determine how much weight you add to the power head. However, the less weight will also create the least amount of power. For example, a 2.0 Ah battery weighs around 2.5 pounds, and the 7.5 Ah battery weighs around 6 pounds. It may not seem like much of a weight difference, but having to hold up a few pounds on the power head can create some exhaustion. If anything, you can try going to Home Depot, since that is the only store that sells Ryobi in person, and test the weights yourself."

      "text": "Ryobi Expand-It Vs. Milwaukee Quik-Lok Edger Attachment: What's The Difference?\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nRyobi and Milwaukee are leaders in the 18-volt cordless tool sector. In addition to battery-operated drills, impact drivers, and various types of saws, each brand offers a complete line of cordless outdoor power equipment, including string trimmers, edgers, and pole saw tree trimmers. Since both brands are owned by the same company, it's not surprising they each offer 18-volt cordless power heads that accept different attachments designed to make clean lines when doing the final touches on garden work. Both brands are available from The Home Depot. You can find Milwaukee tools at other retailers, although Ryobi tools are sold in-store exclusively at Home Depot, they're available online at other retailers.\nIt's important to note that we'll be talking about each brand's edger attachment here, an accessory that won't do you much good without the corresponding power head. At the time of this writing, neither brand offered the powerhead for sale as a stand-alone unit, requiring you to purchase a complete unit, such as a string trimmer or pole saw, and battery, or add it to your collection of like-branded tools with the appropriate attachment system.\nWhat's the difference between Ryobi's Expand-It and Milwaukee's Quik-Lok edger attachments?\nPrice is the first noticeable difference when comparing the two edger attachments. Home Depot sells Ryobi Expand-It 8-inch universal straight shaft edger attachment for $99.00. The price for Milwaukee's M18 Fuel 8-inch Quik-Lok edger attachment is $119.00 at the big-box retail home improvement store. While both attachments will help edge lawns and create straight lines, there are a few key differences that set them apart.\nWhile Ryobi's Expand-It attachments are compatible with some other brands, they are not interchangeable with Milwaukee's Quik-Lok system. Each system offers tool-free attachment with spring-loaded buttons for positive alignment and large hand knobs for easy tightening and loosening. However, Milwaukee's Quik-Lok buttons are easier to operate thanks to a large plastic push tab that actuates the spring button underneath. Both edger attachments have safety guards, adjustable cutting depth, and replaceable blades.\nThese types of lawn care tools with multiple attachments used with a single motor allow for more compact storage of several pieces of equipment. Milwaukee Quik-Lok takes storage and is simple to use with the optional attachment hook, sold in a three-pack by Home Depot for $19.97. The plastic attachment hook slides over the end of the attachment shaft, locking on to the spring button with a slight twist, allowing the tool to hang from a hook while protecting the end of the shaft at the same time.\nDoes the Ryobi Expand-It or Milwaukee Quik-Lok edger have more power?\nRyobi and Milwaukee offer edger attachments that fit their brand-specific cordless powerheads, which provide 18-volts of lithium battery power. However, Ryobi also offers a 40-volt lithium battery-powered option capable of providing power comparable to its gas-powered tools. In addition, if you already own an Expand-It compatible gas-powered string trimmer or pole saw, the Expand-It edger should work with that as well.\nMilwaukee says its M18 REDLITHIUM High Output batteries are superior to the standard M18 REDLITHIUM batteries, with more power providing 50% longer runtimes and generating 50% less heat while in service. The M18 battery lineup includes 18-volt options with a range of amp hour ratings up to 12-amp hours of storage capacity.\nRyobi's ONE+ 18-volt battery system powers a wide range of Ryobi cordless tools. The brand's most powerful ONE+ battery, the 18V ONE+ 12 AH Lithium High Performance, delivers 12-amp hours of 18-volt power like the Milwaukee M18 REDLITHIUM High Output battery and is also advertised with 50 percent longer runtime, although it only runs 30% cooler than previous versions. For more cordless power, Ryobi offers its Quik-Lok compatible tools with a 40-volt lithium battery system. Ryobi claims its 40-volt battery system delivers \"gas performance with fade-free, long-lasting power,\" thanks to its advanced electronics and high-performance brushless motor."

  "argos_summary": "Ryobi\u2019s Expand\u2011It system lets a single 40V or 18V power head run a range of attachments, including a lightweight 475\u202fCFM leaf blower that can move 140\u202fmph air and a gutter blower that reaches 9.5\u202fft. The $99 blower is praised for its power on dry leaves but is heavy and struggles with wet debris, while the gutter blower is convenient for roof\u2011free cleaning but can leave some material behind.
