  "title": "Four Ways These Houseplants Can Improve Your Quality of Life",
  "description": "Indoor plants don\u2019t have to be purely decorative. Plenty of houseplants have practical uses, from purifying your air to repelling insects naturally.",
  "content": "There\u2019s a reason about two-thirds of the households in America have at least one houseplant\u2014many reasons, in fact. For one, they\u2019re beautiful, bringing a blast of fresh, natural beauty into our homes. For another, they\u2019re relatively inexpensive, especially when compared to other interior design elements. And some houseplants are easy to care for, which is ideal for busy lives.\n\nDespite their popularity, however, most of us sleep on another potential benefit of houseplants: Practical, everyday uses. Houseplants don\u2019t have to be merely decorative\u2014the right ones combine that natural beauty with applications that can improve your life in myriad ways. If you\u2019re looking to start an indoor garden or add to your existing collection, here are some of the most useful houseplants you can acquire.\n\nWhile claims that houseplants will scrub and purify your indoor air are overblown, there\u2019s no doubt that houseplants do have a positive impact on your indoor air quality. All plants absorb carbon dioxide and excrete oxygen, after all, so just by having them you\u2019ll be freshening up your home\u2019s air. But specific plants also have more uses:\n\u2022 None Improving humidity. If your house is feeling dry, giving you itchy eyes and skin, adding some spider plants to specific rooms can improve the situation. Studies have shown that spider plants can improve relative humidity in a room, making the space more comfortable. It should be noted that it\u2019s all about leaf surface area, so you need a lot of them to make a real difference: 25 plants in 4-inch pots resulted in a 10% gain of relative humidity in the study, for example, though you could have fewer plants if they were larger.\n\u2022 None Dust reduction. Many houseplants can improve the air quality in your home by capturing dust and other contaminants, trapping the stuff on their ridged leaves and stems. Peace lilies, English ivy, and rubber plants are great choices to have in the house for dust control. Note that these plants remove dust mechanically by capturing it, not by absorbing it in any way\u2014you\u2019ll need to dust them to actually remove the dust.\n\nSome houseplants are useful because they can be used to treat a range of mild discomforts and injuries. You might not be able to throw away all your store-bought stuff just because you have a few potted plants about, but if you include some of these plants in your collection, you can benefit from their proven healing qualities:\n\u2022 None Aloe Vera has soothing properties, and the gel from a cut leaf can be used to treat minor burns (including sunburns) or other skin irritations. It\u2019s also often used as a mild laxative.\n\u2022 None Mint. Mint leaf teas have been used in folk medicine for centuries, and there\u2019s some evidence that mint leaf teas can soothe the digestive tract. Having some fresh mint on hand in the form of an attractive houseplant means you can brew up a little relief any time you want.\n\u2022 None Chamomile. Chamomile is often noted for its soothing qualities, reducing anxiety, aiding digestion, and improving sleep.\n\nYour houseplants can be a source of ingredients in your cooking:\n\u2022 None Herbs. The most obvious choices will be herbs like basil, sage, and parsley (among many, many other choices). These plants are attractive, easy to grow indoors, and can supply you with fresh seasoning for your meals.\n\u2022 None Fruits. Several fruit trees actually thrive indoors. Figs, lemons, cherries, blueberries, and even bananas can be grown indoors, supplementing your grocery bills all year round.\n\u2022 None Vegetables. Tomatoes, peppers, and kale are all beautiful houseplants that will also produce delicious veggies for your salads and other recipes.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to put houseplants in your bedroom, and better sleep is one of them. If you have trouble relaxing and falling asleep, just having plants in your bedroom can create a more serene, calm atmosphere that can promote better sleep. There\u2019s also some evidence that scent can influence the quality and duration of sleep cycles\u2014but it doesn\u2019t have to be that complicated. Having plants that make the bedroom smell nice (like lavender, jasmine, or valerian) can contribute to a pleasant atmosphere that\u2019s conducive to a good night\u2019s sleep.",

      "text": "When you think of farming or gardening for food, you think of the great outdoors. If you want to squeeze a fresh orange or lemon in the morning, you\u2019ll need a certain amount of outdoor space for those trees, after all.\nExcept sometimes you don\u2019t. In addition to the houseplants you're familiar with (and the more unusual plants, like wasabi, that you probably aren't) a wide variety of fruit trees also grow well inside. This means you can combine the decorative beauty of indoor plants with the practical benefit of being able to reach over from wherever you\u2019re sitting and grab a delicious, healthy snack.\nThere are two things to keep in mind if this sounds like your next indoor gardening project: One, in almost every case you should be looking for the \u201cdwarf\u201d varieties of the fruits plants you\u2019re targeting, as they don\u2019t require the space their full-size cousins need. Two, buying a mature tree and transplanting it to your home will always increase your odds of actually getting viable fruit. Planting from seed can work, but it will usually take longer to produce less.\nThat all said, here are your best choices when it comes to growing fruit trees inside\u2014but be aware that, as with all plants, some varieties may be toxic to your pets, so make sure to consider that before getting started.\nFig Tree\nThe ficus carica \u201cPetite Negra\u201d fig tree will start producing fruit relatively quickly (usually when it\u2019s still less than a foot tall). As a dwarf plant, it only gets to about 4-6 feet tall at most (the size of the pot you put it in will determine how large it eventually grows), and the figs it produces will be a rich purple color, and delicious. It\u2019s an easy plant to care for, as it\u2019s naturally pest-resistant and drought-tolerant, so forgetting to water it for a few days won\u2019t kill it. An alternative variant is the \u201cBrown Turkey\u201d fig tree, though you may have to aggressively prune to keep it from taking over your space. Misting either variety regularly is a good idea, as figs typically thrive in humid climates.\nCitrus (lemons, limes, oranges)\nDwarf versions of most citrus plants will grow well indoors\u2014the challenge isn\u2019t getting them to grow, but rather to produce fruit. You\u2019ll have your best luck with calamondin oranges (citrofortunella mitis), Meyer lemons, and Key Limes, all dwarf varieties that tolerate the indoors really well. Keep in mind that while calamondin oranges grow best indoors, they\u2019re not particularly sweet fruits\u2014though they can be used in a wide variety of recipes. Citrus in general like humid conditions, so mist them regularly unless you want to turn your house into a moldy jungle. They also need a lot of sunlight, so position their pots someplace where they\u2019ll get exposure all day long.\nApricots\nDwarf Moorpark apricots are easy to grow indoors. Like a lot of \u201cpit\u201d or \u201cstone\u201d fruit trees, you can grow one from the pit, but if you do, you can expect to wait a few years to get actual fruit from it. A better idea is to buy a young tree and simply transplant it to a pot. Moorparks need to be pruned regularly or they will get too big\u2014but even when pruned, they will reach about six feet in height, so make sure you have the room before you commit. Keep the soil damp and make sure it gets a lot of sunlight; a tree that\u2019s two years or older should begin fruiting within the first year.\nBananas\nBe careful when selecting a banana tree variety, as many will grow well indoors, but not all of them produce fruit you can eat. If a sweet snack is your endgame, choose the dwarf Cavendish variety. These banana trees are easy to grow and will produce bananas within a year or two if grown from seed, and buying a mature plant will skip that part. Banana trees like a lot of water\u2014like, a lot\u2014so you need to water regularly and thoroughly. But you also need to let the soil dry out between waterings, so don\u2019t overdo it. They also like a bit of misting since they\u2019re tropical plants, and you\u2019ll want to place your tree in a spot that gets a lot of sun.\nMulberries\nDwarf Mulberry trees can be \u201ctrained\u201d to be more like bushes or hedges, making them a good choice for indoor growing. Look for dwarf varieties; the Everbearing Mulberry and the Issai Mulberry are good choices that won\u2019t get too large. Both require aggressive pruning, however\u2014left to its own devices, for example, the Everbearing variety can grow to be 15 feet tall. Make sure they get a lot of sun, and water them regularly at first. When they\u2019re established, you can slack off on the watering and they won\u2019t mind a bit.\nCoffee\nYes, coffee is a fruit\u2014the beans we roast and grind to make our life-saving Go Go Juice is the stone of the coffee cherry, actually. And you can grow coffee indoors and even make coffee from it\u2014assuming you are able to go through the process of skinning, soaking, drying, roasting, and grinding your beans once harvested (there\u2019s a reason most people just stumble to the local coffee shop or Keurig machine). The coffea arabica plant is easy to grow (just avoid direct sunlight, which can burn the leaves) and will produce fruit within the first year, along with pretty white flowers and a beautiful fragrance.\nKumquat\nKumquats are citrus plants, but they\u2019re generally easier to grow than lemons or oranges, and several varieties are more or less designed for container living. If you want a kumquat similar to what you find in the grocery store, grow a \u201cNagami\u201d variant, which will give you small, olive-sized fruits. If you want larger fruit, choose a \u201cMeiwa\u201d variety. But you won\u2019t go far wrong with any kumquat tree\u2014when grown in a container they won\u2019t get too large, and all they need is a lot of sunlight and moderate watering.\nGround cherries\nThese are sometimes called Cape Gooseberries, and they aren\u2019t at all like the standard cherries you think of when you hear the name\u2014they\u2019re more closely related to peppers. The taste is actually kind of hard to describe; it's not bad at all, but...unique. Ground cherries actually do well when started from seeds, for a change: Give them full sunlight and moderate watering and you\u2019ll soon have a large-leafed plant that will gift you plenty of delicious fruit. These plants are annuals, so you\u2019ll need to replant every year if you want more.\nMiracle berry\nIf you want an indoor fruit tree that doubles as a party trick, grow synsepalum dulcificum, aka Miracle Berries. The party trick is that after you eat some Miracle Berries, anything you eat afterward will taste sweet, no matter how sour or bitter the food actually is. The effects last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, so be careful, as mistiming your snack could ruin your next meal. They grow easily indoors; all they need is lots of indirect sunlight and plenty of misting, as they thrive in humidity. If your plant looks a bit wan, you can wrap it in clear plastic for a bit to raise its humidity levels.\nAvocados\nAvocados will sprout from their pits if you follow the famous \u201ctoothpick in a glass\u201d technique, but there\u2019s a caveat: Avocado plants grown from pits will almost never fruit. In other words, you\u2019ll get a nice, healthy plant, but you will die of old age before it gives you a single avocado. Your best bet is to get a starter plant. The \u201cDay\u201d variety is the easiest type of avocado to fruit in a pot, so look for one of those in your local nursery or garden section. It still may take some time before you get an avocado or two, but it will happen a lot faster than never, which is how long it will likely take if you start from the pit."

      "text": "Along with strawberries, watermelon, and peaches, blueberries are one of the signature fruit flavors of the summer. And if you find yourself going through container after container of them each year, you may have wondered about the possibility of growing your own. (That is, if you don\u2019t currently live on a farm or somewhere with plenty of arable land).\nAs it turns out, not only is growing your own blueberry bush possible, but you can do it from your kitchen. Here\u2019s what to know.\nHow to grow a blueberry bush\nTechnically, growing your own blueberry bush inside your home has always been an option, but thanks to a viral TikTok, now more people know about it. The video, posted by Armen Adamjan (aka @creative_explained), walks the viewer through the planting process\u2014beginning with a single blueberry.\nTo get started, fill a small pot (the kind with drainage holes on the bottom) with soil. Then, take the blueberry and squeeze it, releasing its seeds. From there, stick it in the pot, and cover it with a light layer of soil, and then water. Next, place some sort of cup, glass, or bottle over it to create a mini-greenhouse and trap humidity. (In the video, he cuts the bottom off of a plastic bottle and uses that.)\nOnce a seedling pushes its way out of the soil, you can uncover it and grow it like other indoor plants\u2014making sure it gets enough sunlight and water. How much water, exactly? According to an article on MindBodyGreen, you\u2019ll want to water the plant every week and keep it at the point where the soil is moist, but not soggy.\nWhen to transfer the blueberry plant outside\nAccording to the TikTok, when the seedling gets to be six inches tall (and the outdoor conditions are suitable for growing plants), move the baby bush outside and continue to care for it there. However, the article on MindBodyGreen says that it\u2019s possible to keep the blueberry plant indoors for a few years\u2014or until it starts producing fruit\u2014before having to replant it outside.\nAnd yes, it\u2019ll probably take a few years for the blueberry plant to produce actual blueberries, so patience is key."

      "text": "For a long time\u2014despite my outdoor gardening expertise\u2014I steered clear of houseplants. Houseplants, I felt, rely on you too much. They bear no fruit, and they kind of \u2026 sit there. But over the pandemic, I decided that my living room needed more life and built out a plant wall. It was the start of a love affair with indoor plants\u2014the key is starting with plants that are easy for beginners. I recommend starting with big, leafy plants, rather than succulents\u2014there\u2019s a higher payoff as new leaves emerge. Here are the plants I\u2019d consider.\nPothos\nI love walking into someone\u2019s house and seeing a pothos claiming the space. Those long, trailing plants you see crawling someone\u2019s walls and shelves? It\u2019s likely a pothos, and they come in a huge variety of patterns and colors. While there are verdant solid green pothos, the plethora of variegation possible on the leaves is astounding. There are yellow varieties like Golden pothos, too. This is an easy, hard-to-kill plant. It requires little of you\u2014use a relatively shallow planter, water once a week, and occasionally, give it some plant food. Support the trailing vines as they begin to grow using plant clips along the wall. A pothos can fill a large space easily, and will grow with you over time.\nMonstera\nMonsteras had a moment a few years ago, and remain very popular. There are varieties of monstera that can go for thousands of dollars, but your basic monstera deliciosa is easy and cheap. (If a friend has one, you can easily propagate theirs.) Monsteras are a split leaf variety of philodendron. Some varieties will develop holes (these varieties are referred to as cheese varieties). One of the charms of monsteras is that you can leave them in water, instead of planting them in soil, which I do.\nSpider plant\nSpider plants were hugely popular in the '70s and have been a mainstay since then. Spider plants get their name because they form offshoots easily, similar to strawberry plants; each \u201cbaby\u201d spider can be cut off and become its own plant. Spider plants grow larger, and so your main task is going to be ensuring that the pot the plant is in is large enough. Otherwise, spiders are easy to maintain\u2014hang them and wait for baby spiders to \u201cjump\u201d from the pot.\nBamboo plant\nOutdoors, gardeners tend to avoid bamboo, due to its propensity to spread. Indoors, bamboo is popular and a common gift. Bamboo doesn\u2019t require a lot of light, preferring low or medium light, and doesn\u2019t even require soil. You can plant it in rocks or glass pebbles; you just need the roots submerged. Bamboo can benefit from a light fertilizer once or twice a year.\nCast iron plant\nIf you\u2019re looking for a pet-safe, larger plant, consider a cast iron. With tall, long, graceful leaves on tiny but strong stems, cast iron is passive, as plants go. It requires the least amount of attention of all my plants. Once a year it shoots up a few new leaves, some of which stick straight up and some of which drape over the side of the planter. Like other plants, there are varieties of the cast iron that are more interesting than a standard green variety, with variegation and color shifts.\nFerns\nThere are more ferns than you can imagine, and they come in so many shapes and textures. I am constantly in awe of the new varieties I fall in love with. Most people know asparagus ferns, which are the most resilient, in my opinion. They shoot out branches with tiny spiked leaves that can become quite fluffy. Maidenhair ferns have tiny, delicate leaves and look like something you\u2019d want to pet. I am obsessed with cotton candy ferns, which are so fluffy and soft and grow to gigantic pillow size. Birds nest ferns reach out with leaves that resemble arms, with finger-like tips. Lastly, there are few ferns as majestic as the Staghorn fern, which you can mount on a wall, but can also live in a planter. Ferns love the indoors, and don\u2019t need as much sunlight as other plants. They love moist but not wet soil. What\u2019s wonderful about ferns is they tell you how they\u2019re feeling. You can tell if they need more water if they become droopy.\nPhilodendron\nIf you like monsteras, philodendrons make sense for you. There are tons of varieties, and they do well in planters inside. Whether hanging or in a standing planter, philodendrons want to grow. They\u2019ll send out giant, reaching leaves on delicate stems and if needed, send aerial roots out as well. You\u2019ll want to ensure the planter has enough room for the root ball, and that might mean upgrading the size of pot year to year. Philodendrons require as much water as ferns, and benefit from occasional weak fertilizing.\nAloe\nI make an exception to my avoidance of succulents for aloe for obvious reasons: its usefulness. Aloe has long been used to soothe burns and rashes. Aloe plants require a decent amount of indirect sunlight, so if you\u2019re not locating this plant by a window, it will need a plant light. Aloe doesn\u2019t like wet feet, so you want to ensure you don\u2019t overwater it, but if the leaves turn yellow, it is a sign that it is under-watered. A succulent potting mix is appropriate.\nWhere to find houseplants\nThere will inevitably be tons of nurseries with houseplants near you, but also consider finding friends who have the plants you like. Most houseplants are easily propagated. Also, consider online sources. For the past few years, I've sourced most of my plants on sites like Etsy and the app Palmstreet."

      "text": "Houseplants are a beautiful addition to your living space, but beauty doesn\u2019t come cheap. Plants take time, space, and perhaps most importantly, money to obtain and maintain. While plant prices vary widely, the average plant costs $25 upfront and $23 per year to care for.\nBut all is not lost for aspiring plant parents on a budget. While you may spend some money on supplies over time, you don\u2019t necessarily have to shell out a lot of cash to get started.\nWhere to get cheap (or free) houseplants\nYou don\u2019t have to pay a lot of money at your local garden nursery to launch your houseplant collection. Here are a few other places where you might find cheaper or free plants:\nFacebook Marketplace, Buy Nothing, and online classifieds. Check your local buy/sell sites to find plants for little or nothing from people who are moving or whose space isn\u2019t ideal for plants to thrive. In addition to Marketplace, you can search for hyperlocal/neighborhood-based Buy Nothing groups on Facebook, where you can request plants or cuttings for free.\nLocal garden clubs. Local garden groups often host workshops and plant sales with free or discounted plants and other materials.\nPlant swaps. Check Facebook, Instagram, Nextdoor, and other local pages for plant swaps, where people bring plants and cuttings to trade. These events are sometimes hosted by community organizations and mutual aid groups\u2014or you can put one together yourself.\nEstate, rummage, and yard sales. You may find low-cost houseplants alongside furniture, home goods, and other items at garage sales.\nParties and events. Next time you go to a wedding or fundraiser, ask if you can take potted plants home at the end of the night.\nBarter or trade with friends, family, coworkers, and social networks. Do you have a special skill or item to trade? Ask other plant parents if they\u2019re willing to give you plants or cuttings in exchange.\nGarden centers. While either your local nursery or big-box garden center isn\u2019t the first place to look for free or cheap houseplants, you can occasionally find discounted or clearance items (which may require a little extra TLC) or even convince the staff to let you take dropped leaves to propagate at home.\nNeglected plants. Occasionally buyers will return plants to garden centers that have been neglected, for which you can negotiate a lower purchase price. Or if you see a plant in bad shape at a business you frequent or a friend\u2019s house, simply offer to take it home.\nHow to DIY your houseplant collection\nIn addition to picking up plants and cuttings from other people and places, you can also grow your collection on your own for less than the cost of a mature houseplant:\nPropagate your existing plants. Get more out of the plants you already have by using one of several propagation methods.\nPick leaves. The ethics of this approach are up to you, but another way to get cuttings is to simply take them from gardens, parks, your neighbor\u2019s yard, etc.\nStart from seed. This isn\u2019t just for garden veggies. You can also grow houseplants like monstera and cacti straight from seed at a much lower cost than buying a mature plant.\nBring outdoor (and wild) plants inside. You can try bringing home wild plants like roadside succulents and aloe\u2014or transfer outdoor plants inside during the winter. Make sure to check for pests before bringing anything wild into your home.\nFinally, you can save money by getting creative with your containers. Not every houseplant needs a fancy pot and statement stand. Reuse (clean) plastic nursery pots, cans and tins (with holes drilled into the bottoms), and orphan plates and bowls instead of buying pots and trays."

      "text": "Having your own lemon tree at home is often a luxury we assume is reserved for people who live in citrus-friendly locales, like sunny California or humid Florida. However, that doesn\u2019t mean those in the northeast, midwest, or other regions of the country can\u2019t enjoy the simple pleasure of their own fresh-squeezed lemonade. With a little bit of attention, you can grow a lemon tree right inside your home.\nHere\u2019s how to grow and care for a lemon tree (without moving to Florida).\nThe best lemon trees to grow indoors\nLemon trees that thrive outside with a lot of room won\u2019t do well in an enclosed environment, so it\u2019s important to know the specifics about different breeds and their sizes. In general, a dwarf tree will be best for smaller spaces. Dwarf fruit trees can grow up to eight to ten feet tall in height, which is certainly bigger than your average house plant, but it\u2019s smaller than the average lemon tree. Dwarf trees can also grow in pots and containers indoors, rather than ground soil, and they are easier to prune and their size is easier to maintain because the roots are shorter than other varieties. The best part: They reach maturity faster, so you\u2019ll get fruit sooner than you expect.\nChoosing the right kind of tree also depends on what type of taste you like and how much work you want to put into it. If you want a tree that requires less maintenance and produce lemons on the sweeter side, you should opt for dwarf meyer lemon tree. Meyer lemons are a blend of sour lemons and sweet oranges, which make them sweeter-than-an-average lemon. They can also survive without a great deal of heat and are easy to care for. Dwarf eureka lemons grow year round but are more on the tart side. However, eureka lemon trees need a lot of light to thrive, so make sure it\u2019s near a south-facing window if you choose to grow these lemons indoors.\nHow to choose the right planter pot for your lemon tree\nThe right planter pot is essential for the healthy growth of your lemon tree\u2014and the most important element is its drainage holes. You don\u2019t want the plant to sit in water because that can promote root rot. Terracotta pots are particularly good for drainage, but you can also use plastic or glazed pots with adequate drain holes.\nApartment Therapy recommends the planting pot be at least double the size of the root ball of the plant\u2014that will give the roots enough room to grow and bear fruit. The soil should be a mix that drains well, too. If you make your own soil, Apartment Therapy suggests emulating their natural soil by mixing equal parts potting mix and sand.\nCaring for an indoor lemon tree\nLemon trees grown indoors are in a different class of care than those outdoors. For example, as Gardening Know How explains, \u201cIf the variety of lemon you are growing normally has a hardiness zone of 7, in a container the lemon tree will have a hardiness zone of 8.\u201d So, you\u2019ll want to water and fertilize accordingly. Water at least two or three times a week\u2014sometimes daily during growing seasons\u2014and make sure to soak the plant enough that you see water escape through the drain holes. Keeping the plant moist (but not soaked) will give the roots the right amount of hydration to keep the leaves healthy; you should never let the plant dry out completely.\nFertilizer is another key element for your lemon tree. Planting company Pennington says that \u201clemon trees require plentiful nitrogen, as well as other essential nutrients, including magnesium and iron.\u201d Fertilize every three to four months, making sure not to disturb the shallow roots, which can damage the plant.\nHow to know if your indoor lemon tree is struggling\nThere are signs to be aware of that your potted tree could be in danger. Look out for yellow leaves, which can be a sign of soggy roots (meaning the pot is not draining properly). You should also pay extra attention to your lemon tree in the winter months, as they are very susceptible to the cold.\nYou\u2019ll also want to watch out for \u201csucker branches\u201d that can begin growing at the root of the plant and taking over the tree\u2014make sure to prune these as soon as you see them. If you follow these steps, you\u2019ll have year-round juicy lemons."

      "text": "While much has been written about plants being able to purify the air from harmful chemicals like formaldehyde, benzene, and volatile organic compounds (based on an oft-cited 1989 NASA study), that study has also been debunked as having no significant correlation to the air quality of your home (for one, it was conducted in two foot by two foot sealed chambers).\nWhile plants may not rid your home of VOCs, they will add oxygen, potentially reduce stress, and decrease airborne dust by drawing the particles to their surfaces. According to blogger and horticulturist Toni Colgrove, \u201cHouseplants do remove dust particles from the air by means of trapping them on the surface of their leaves. Plants that have crinkled and/or hairy leaves remove more dust than smooth or strappy leaves. Some of the effects are because the leaves slow down the air movement...Some...are due to crinkled or hairy leaves physically filtering dust from the air as it moves across the surface of the leaf.\u201d\nThe top dust-collecting plants\nIt could be said that all plants are dust collectors, and honestly, we couldn\u2019t argue that point. However, certain plants are ideal for this job, as they provide more surface area on which to trap dust. Now, will they absorb that dust through some amazing scientific process? Unfortunately, no. You\u2019ll still need to dust them occasionally, to make sure they get enough light to photosynthesize properly, and you know, stay alive.\nBut here for your breathing pleasure, is a list of the top indoor houseplants that reduce airborne dust:\nFerns (though some are notoriously hard to keep alive)\nColgrove adds, \u201cDo not use this list to exclude any plant from your home or office, any plant you enjoy will trap dust. Just the plants that have a larger amount of surface area total (not just large leaves) will trap the greater amount of dust.\u201d (And remember to dust them every couple of months\u2014here\u2019s how.)\nEven better? Get a self-cleaning plant\nDid you know there are actually plants that effectively dust themselves? This is due to a phenomenon known as the \u201clotus effect\u201d or \u201cultra-hydrophobicity\u201d first observed by German botanist Wilhelm Barthlott on the leaves of the lotus flower. As Wikipedia (fairly) succinctly puts it, this when \u201cdirt particles are picked up by water droplets due to the micro- and nanoscopic architecture on the surface, which minimizes the droplet\u2019s adhesion to that surface.\u201d\nPut more simply, though, certain leaves have microscopically tiny spikes that create a bumpy, rough surface that repels water. When water touches that leaf, instead of soaking into the microscopic grooves, it rolls off the surface of the leaf, taking dirt and dust with it. (This process also serves as a layer of protection against disease-causing pathogens.) Other plants with this property include: violet, aloe, lantana, taro, and Indian canna.\nWhether you choose (airborne) dust-reducing or self-cleaning, both provide benefits that make trying to keep them alive worth it."

      "text": "Growing vegetables indoors takes some finesse, but is entirely possible. It\u2019s even doable for beginners, if you\u2019re willing to do a little research (and maybe practice on a couple of houseplants first); and if you\u2019re an intermediate gardener, well, what are you waiting for? It\u2019s time to take on the challenge of growing an indoor garden.\nWhat you need to start an indoor garden\nThe list of supplies is more extensive than your average garden as you\u2019ll need to compensate for what would naturally happen outdoors, including the right soil, drainage, light, and airflow. The things you\u2019ll need includes:\nGrow lights\nPotting soil\nContainers to propagate seeds\nPlanter pots with drainage holes (for any store-bought vegetable plants)\nGrow lamps (optional, but highly recommended)\nPlanting sticks and galvanized wire (for plant training)\nPlant labels\nand a humidifier (optional)\nWhat plants to grow in your indoor garden\nYou probably want to pick the easiest vegetables, especially if this is your first try at growing a garden indoors. A beginner\u2019s indoor garden isn\u2019t time to see if you can grow something like muskmelon. Instead, focus on lower-maintenance plants like tomatoes, peppers, and dwarf citrus that love warm weather, or cool-tolerant veggies like mustard greens, broccoli, beets, and kale. And, of course, herbs like rosemary, thyme, sage, and oregano thrive as indoor plants (here\u2019s our quick guide on growing an herb garden, because you deserve one).\nHow to get started on your indoor vegetable garden\nIf you\u2019re beginning with seeds, you\u2019ll start with the small containers and potting soil, planting your seeds as directed on the seed packet. Once your seeds have sprouted enough leaves, re-pot the plants accordingly.\nBut once the obvious part is out of the way, you\u2019ll need to be more thoughtful about where to put them\u2014your now-sprouted greens will need to be organized around your house based on the climate and light they need. Most vegetables need about 4-6 hours of light, so keep that in mind whether you\u2019re using natural lights or grow lights.\nAdditionally, take into consideration the climate your plants need. The cool-climate plants like kale and broccoli don\u2019t need to be in direct sunlight and heat, so put them somewhere cool. For warm-loving plants, the winter months can be challenging, and is when a humidifier can be helpful. A simple oscillating fan can also be helpful.\nOf course, remember to water as recommended and fertilize in the growing months based on the specific types of veggies you\u2019re growing. In general, University of Florida Gardening Solutions says that \u201ca balanced fertilizer is applied every three to four weeks throughout the growing season. Don\u2019t stop applications when fruit appears\u2014continue to apply fertilizer as needed to ensure continued production.\u201d Once your plants produce vegetables, they\u2019re ready for harvest, and you can pat yourself on the back. You did it. Now try that muskmelon next."

      "text": "Contrary to popular belief, houseplants aren\u2019t nature\u2019s air purifiers, capable of \u201ccleaning\u201d the air before your breathe it in. They do, however, come with other health benefits, and can help reduce stress levels, boost our productivity, and improve our mood and outlook. Plus, from a design perspective, houseplants add color and life to a room, as well as the feeling of bringing the calming effects of nature indoors.\nFor these, and other reasons, many people opt to keep plants in their bedroom. But some are better suited to the boudoir than others. Here are a few examples of the best houseplants for bedrooms.\nThe best plants for bedrooms\nFirst and foremost, the best plants for your bedroom are ones that you won\u2019t kill, and won\u2019t kill you (or, more realistically, trigger your allergies). So, before investing in any kind of houseplant, be sure it\u2019s not one you\u2019re allergic to, but is one that you\u2019re comfortable maintaining. Here are a few to consider:\nAloe vera\nAlthough aloe requires a lot of sunlight, it doesn\u2019t need a lot of water to survive, making it a great set-it-and-forget-it bedroom plant. Plus, it\u2019s pretty convenient if you need to soothe any cuts or burns.\nSnake plant\nAlso known as \u201cmother-in-law\u2019s tongue,\u201d this is one of the easiest plants to keep alive. It just needs partial or low light, and the occasional watering, and it\u2019ll keep growing. It\u2019s also easy to dust.\nFrench lavender\nLavender has a reputation of promoting sleep, and there\u2019s even some limited scientific evidence supporting that claim. But even if sniffing the plant or its oil doesn\u2019t lull you to sleep, you may enjoy the aroma and colorful blossoms when they\u2019re in season.\nThe tricky part is that most lavender won\u2019t survive indoors. You can always plant some outside your bedroom window, or, if you want it in houseplant form, opt for potted French lavender.\nMoney plants\nNot only do their long, slender leaves add a unique shape to your decor, but as long as they\u2019re placed in bright, indirect light, they\u2019re relatively easy to maintain.\nFake plants\nPlants don\u2019t necessarily need to be real in order for you to reap their health benefits. Plus, faux foliage is the easiest to maintain\u2014just don\u2019t forget to dust it regularly."
