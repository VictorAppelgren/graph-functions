      "feedback": "The draft shows solid macro framing and concrete GM-context detail, but it fails the SECTION FOCUS on 4 Movers and a tight Swing Trade outline, and it mixes in long-form analysis that should live in a separate section. Actionable edits: enforce exactly 4 Movers lines (2 Up, 2 Down) with the required 5-field format (Direction | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %), drop the extra “Long GM” line and all extended narrative from the Movers block, and place a separate 1–2 line Outlook/Swing Trade for GM beneath as its own dedicated plan. Recast the four lines to be crisp, mutually exclusive, and fully sourced: Up 0–8 weeks (tariff cadence and pass-through as price-floor catalyst; GM US capex as domestic-output anchor) with a watch on tariff announcements, GM production/margin signals, and Cadillac Elevated Velocity context; P anchored to explicit material (e.g., 58% with WTNT85IPR/GM). Up 2–6 months (policy relief or faster domestic EV supply reliefs; improved capacity utilization) watching big-bill milestones and GM cadence for margin recovery; P=32% (EPJYXB7DX)(GM). Down 0–8 weeks (tariff-driven price pressures and inflation risk; auto-financing costs) watching tariff intensity and inflation path plus auto-pass-through signals; P=28% (0J41Q7KTX)(S15934PBQ)(CDBMWIUTB). Down 3–6 months (EV-transition uncertainty and financing-tightening; auto-demand erosion) watching GM EV cadence translating into margins and capex pacing; P=30% (22PL3Q360)(EPJYXB7DX). For the Swing Trade, if GM is tradable, include a single 1–2 line plan: Direction Up | Horizon 0–8 weeks | Entry near current level; Stop below swing low; Target above recent highs; R/R 2:1 | Invalidation: tariffs escalate beyond baseline or inflation surprise; Trigger: tariff cadence signals or GM production milestones | Probability 60% | Confidence 70. Tighten the first-principles backbone by clearly mapping AI-driven productivity to sectoral reallocation to wage dynamics to policy design to risk premia, with explicit anchors (e.g., NL5YYTLF2 for automation exposure; SGB2PAZGK on tariff-cost framing; 22PL3Q360 on Ford as cycle proxy; GM/WTNT85IPR for capex signals) and keep every factual claim tethered to the IDs in parentheses; ensure all numbers used (automation shares, tariff percentages, GM capex, auto margins) are cited; reconcile conflicts by framing them as regime-weight risks rather than contradictions, and keep horizons aligned (0–8 weeks and 2–6 months for movers; a single, actionable GM swing-trade line).",
