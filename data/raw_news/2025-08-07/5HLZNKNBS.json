  "title": "Why Are Weight-Loss Stocks Gaining Thursday? - Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX), Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), Structure Therapeutics (NASDAQ:GPCR), Terns Pharma (NASDAQ:TERN)",
  "description": "Eli Lilly's obesity drug data misses targets, boosting shares of Novo Nordisk, Viking, Structure, and Terns amid promising trial updates.",
  "content": "On Thursday, Eli Lilly and Co.\u2019s LLY weight loss rival Novo Nordisk A/S NVO, along with smaller firms, Terns Pharmaceuticals, Inc. TERN, Viking Therapeutics Inc. VKTX, and Structure Therapeutics Inc. GPCR are trading higher.\n\nLilly released topline data from the Phase 3 ATTAIN-1 trial evaluating orforglipron that showed an average weight loss of 12.4% (27.3 lbs) compared to 0.9% (2.2 lbs) with placebo, below the 15% expectations. Orforglipron could be the first small-molecule weight-loss pill if it launches in 2026.\n\nWilliam Blair analysts described this as a \u201conce-in-a-blue-moon\u201d miss for Lilly\u2019s otherwise dominant obesity franchise. They highlighted that orforglipron\u2019s 9.1% placebo-adjusted weight loss at the 36 mg dose underperformed compared to weekly subcutaneous Wegovy, which delivers 12\u201313% weight loss.\n\nAlso Read: Trump Administration Plan Signals Shift Toward Weight-Loss Drug Coverage For Medicare Patients\n\nAdditionally, gastrointestinal side effects were comparable to Wegovy, but orforglipron had a higher treatment discontinuation rate (5.1\u201310.3% vs. 7.0% for Wegovy, 2.6% for placebo).\n\nThey also noted early plateauing of weight loss and persistent side effects as potential liabilities for orforglipron, as previously flagged during the ACHIEVE-1 presentation at the American Diabetes Association.\n\nThis rare underperformance opens the door for smaller biopharma competitors, analyst Andy Hsieh of William Blair noted.\n\n\u201cFrom a stock perspective, we believe that Eli Lilly\u2019s rare miss from its otherwise impenetrable obesity franchise could create an opening for smaller competitors,\u201d he added.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s oral semaglutide 25 mg achieved a 16.6% weight loss vs. a 2.7% reduction with placebo after 68 weeks. CagriSema achieved a weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks in one study and 15.7% in another.\n\nViking is expected to report Phase 2 VENTURE-Oral results of the oral tablet formulation of VK2735 in obesity in the second half of 2025. Analyst Andy Hsieh expects the data readout could be as early as later this month.\n\nResults from a 28-day Phase 1 multiple ascending dose trial of VK2735 in healthy volunteers with a BMI \u226530 demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in mean body weight from baseline, ranging up to 8.2%.\n\nPersistent weight loss effects were observed at follow-up visits through Day 57, ranging up to 8.3% from baseline, four weeks after the last dose of VK2735 was administered.\n\nStructure Therapeutics, which is advancing the oral small molecule aleniglipron that resembles orforglipron but with a shorter half-life, is expected to report results from two Phase 2 studies, ACCESS and ACCESS II, in the fourth quarter.\n\nStructure Therapeutics is also conducting three new aleniglipron clinical studies as planned, which will generate additional data to competitively position aleniglipron and further support the design of the Phase 3 program.\n\nIn June 2024, Structure Therapeutics unveiled 12-week topline obesity data from its Phase 2a study of GSBR-1290.\n\nIn the Phase 2a obesity study, GSBR-1290 demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant placebo-adjusted mean decrease in weight of 6.2% at 12 weeks.\n\nTern is developing TERN-601, an oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1-RA) for obesity. The Phase 2 FALCON trial enrollment completed in the second quarter of 2025 and topline 12-week data is expected in the early fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nPhase 1 trial data in healthy subjects showed TERN-601 was well tolerated and demonstrated dose-dependent, statistically significant placebo-adjusted mean weight loss across all three doses evaluated in the 28-day MAD study, with maximum placebo-adjusted mean weight loss of 4.9% at the highest dose of 740 mg QD.\n\nPrice Action: VKTX stock is up 11.2% at $35.46, TERN stock is up 3.70% at $5.88, NVO stock is up 7.47% at $48.79, and GPCR stock is up 7.36% at $17.58 at last check Thursday.\n\u2022 Cathie Wood Shouts Out Shopify\u2019s Smart AI Moves In Retail, Says It\u2019s \u2018Seizing The Agentic AI Moment:\u2019 SHOP Stock Gained Over 44% In 2025",

According to the research, a new protocol called the Model Context Protocol (MCP) will be foundational for these AI agents.\nThis is where Shopify shines, as the ARK note explicitly highlights that Shopify natively supports MCP endpoints, a critical move that allows its merchants\u2019 product data to be easily accessed by AI agents.\nThe analysts state, \u201cJust as the rise of Google's Search Engine Optimization (SEO) transformed digital publishing, AI agents should give rise to Agent-Oriented Optimization (AOO).\u201d\nWhy It Matters: Shopify\u2019s partnerships with AI leaders like OpenAI and Microsoft Corp. MSFT further solidify this view.\nFor instance, the note mentions that Shopify is providing the foundation for OpenAI\u2019s in-app checkout functionality, directly linking its platform to the agents that will drive future commerce.\nAs a result, Wood and her team see Shopify not just as an e-commerce platform, but as a key piece of infrastructure in the coming AI-driven retail landscape.\nShopify delivered a mixed second quarter with a revenue growth of 31% year-over-year to $2.68 billion, beating the analyst consensus estimate of $2.55 billion. Whereas, the e-commerce platform reported adjusted EPS of 35 cents, up 34.6% year-on-year, but missed the analyst consensus estimate of 29 cents.\nPrice Action: SHOP stock was up 0.14% in premarket on Thursday, but it was up 44.05% year-to-date and 142.45% over the past year.\nBenzinga's Edge Stock Rankings indicate that SHOP maintains a strong price trend in the long, short, and medium terms. However, the stock scores poorly on value rankings. Additional performance details are available here.\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Invesco QQQ Trust ETF QQQ, which track the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 index, respectively, rose in premarket on Thursday.

GPCR, a clinical-stage global biopharmaceutical company developing novel oral small molecule therapeutics for metabolic diseases, with a focus on obesity, today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025, and provided a business update.\n\"The ACCESS and ACCESS II studies for aleniglipron, our once-daily oral small molecule GLP-1 program, remain on track for topline data readouts by the end of the year,\" said Raymond Stevens, Ph.D., CEO of Structure Therapeutics. \"With our continued confidence in aleniglipron's profile, we have initiated additional supplementary studies to ensure we are well positioned for Phase 3 and to maximize the therapeutic and competitive potential of this program. By the end of 2025, we also plan to initiate the Phase 1 study of ACCG-2671, which we believe represents the most advanced oral small molecule amylin agonist in development. As the obesity field shifts towards combinability of multiple targets and long-term weight loss maintenance, we are excited to lead the way with a highly scalable pipeline of oral small molecule medicines designed to address the substantial unmet needs in obesity management and related metabolic diseases.\"\nRecent and Upcoming Milestones\nAleniglipron (GSBR-1290) - Oral Small Molecule Selective Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) Receptor Agonist for the Treatment of Obesity and Overweight\nOngoing Phase 2b ACCESS and Phase 2 ACCESS II Studies\nThe fully enrolled ACCESS and ACCESS II studies are on track for topline 36-week data readouts by year-end 2025.\n- ACCESS enrolled approximately 220 adults living with obesity, or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity, and is designed to evaluate doses up to 120 mg of aleniglipron with a slower four-week titration schedule.\n- ACCESS II enrolled approximately 80 adults living with obesity, or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity, and is designed to evaluate higher doses of aleniglipron (180 mg and 240 mg) with a slower four-week titration schedule.\nExpanded Data Collection from ACCESS and ACCESS II Studies\nStructure Therapeutics has implemented extensions to the ongoing ACCESS and ACCESS II studies:\n- ACCESS Open Label Extension (OLE) \u2013 All patients in the Phase 2b ACCESS study are provided an option to roll over into the OLE and receive aleniglipron after completing the double-blinded randomized portion of the study. This will allow collection of data on longer-term weight loss effects, expand the overall safety database and provide aleniglipron access to patients enrolled in the blinded portion of the study who opt in to the extension.\n- ACCESS II Extension \u2013 Following the initial 36-week efficacy evaluation, patients will now continue on their assigned dose to 44 weeks, which allows for collection of an additional eight weeks of double-blinded safety, tolerability, and efficacy data in the study. Overall, this extension will provide additional longer-term data in the two potentially higher dose arms of 180 mg and 240 mg. Per protocol and as previously planned, a formal unblinded efficacy assessment at 36 weeks is expected by year-end 2025.\nThree Additional Aleniglipron Studies\nStructure Therapeutics is also conducting three new aleniglipron clinical studies as planned that will generate additional data to competitively position aleniglipron and further support the design of the Phase 3 program.\n- Phase 2 study to assess a maintenance switching strategy from an approved injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist to aleniglipron \u2013 Specifically, this maintenance switching study will evaluate the transition from an approved injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist to once-daily oral aleniglipron for weight loss maintenance. This study will assess the starting dose and the weight loss maintenance over 12 weeks. Enrollment is expected to start in the third quarter of 2025.\n- Phase 2 body composition study \u2013 This study will assess the effect of aleniglipron on body fat loss over a 40-week evaluation period. These data will be used to incorporate body composition endpoints into the Phase 3 program. Enrollment is expected to start in the third quarter of 2025.\n- Phase 2 study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) \u2013 This placebo-controlled study in patients with obesity or overweight and T2DM is anticipated to start in the fourth quarter of 2025. Data from the 38-week study may be used to support the inclusion of a cohort of T2DM in the Phase 3 obesity program.\nOral Small Molecule Amylin Receptor Agonists for the Treatment of Obesity or Overweight with Comorbidities\n- ACCG-2671 \u2013 Investigational new drug (IND) enabling activities for ACCG-2671 are ongoing; Structure Therapeutics plans to initiate a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical study by year-end 2025.\n- New preclinical data for ACCG-2671 was presented in a late-breaking poster session at the American Diabetes Association 85th Scientific Sessions in June 2025. ACCG-2671 demonstrated high binding affinity and balanced potency in human calcitonin receptor and amylin receptor functional assays. In diet-induced obese rats, oral administration of ACCG-2671 resulted in significant, dose-dependent body weight reductions. Combination therapy with semaglutide (both as add-on and concurrent treatment) resulted in superior weight loss compared to monotherapy of either compound.\nOral Small Molecule Metabolic Pipeline and Potential Combinations:\n- Oral Small Molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) Program: Structure Therapeutics is developing a GIPR selective agonist and antagonist and GLP-1R/GIPR combinations to treat obesity and related diseases.\n- Oral Small Molecule glucagon receptor (GCGR) Program: Structure Therapeutics is developing a GCGR selective agonist and GLP-1R/GCGR combinations for the treatment of obesity and related diseases.\n- Oral Small Molecule apelin (APJR) Program: Structure Therapeutics is evaluating ANPA-0073, a Phase 2 ready biased APJR agonist for potential selective or muscle-sparing weight loss. The Company has finished a Phase 1 single-ascending and multiple-ascending dose study, in which ANPA-0073 was generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs) reported. Long-term chronic GLP-toxicology studies are currently underway and expected to be completed by the end of 2025.\nOral Small Molecule Lysophosphatidic Acid 1 Receptor (LPA1R) Program for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)\nStructure Therapeutics has successfully finished a Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose clinical study of LTSE-2578, an oral small molecule antagonist that targets the LPA1R for the treatment of IPF. In the study there was no evidence of any dose-dependent LTSE-2578-related adverse events, including clinical, laboratory and electrocardiogram recordings. No SAEs were observed in the study.\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights\nCash Position: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $786.5 million on June 30, 2025. The Company expects its current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to fund projected operations and key clinical milestones through at least 2027. For aleniglipron, this includes the ongoing ACCESS and ACCESS II studies, extension studies, and the three new clinical studies announced, but excludes Phase 3 registrational studies.\nResearch and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses for the second quarter of 2025 were $54.7 million, as compared to $22.1 million for the same period in 2024. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily due to increases related to pre-clinical research and development expenses, clinical trial costs and personnel-related expenses due to an increase in headcount to support the advancement of our GLP-1R franchise including aleniglipron.\nGeneral and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses for the second quarter of 2025 were $15.7 million, as compared to $11.3 million for the same period in 2024. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to increases in employee expenses as we expanded our infrastructure to drive and support the growth in our operations as a publicly-traded company.\nNet Loss: Net loss for the second quarter of 2025 totaled $61.7 million, with non-cash share-based compensation expense of $7.5 million, compared to $26.0 million for the second quarter of 2024 with non-cash share-based compensation expense of $4.2 million.\nAbout Structure Therapeutics\nStructure Therapeutics is a science-driven clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing innovative oral small molecule treatments for chronic metabolic and cardiopulmonary conditions with significant unmet medical needs.

      "text": "Phase 1 trial of TERN-701 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) enrolling well; efficacy and safety data including 6-month major molecular response (MMR) rates expected in 4Q25\nPhase 2 trial of TERN-601 for obesity completed enrollment; 12-week efficacy, safety and tolerability data expected in early 4Q25\nCash runway into 2028 focused on advancing CML program internally and partnering metabolic assets\nTerns to host a TERN-701-focused educational webinar in September 2025\nFOSTER CITY, Calif., Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Terns Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Terns or the Company) TERN, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of small-molecule product candidates to address serious diseases, including oncology and obesity, today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025, and provided corporate updates.\n\"The Terns team continues to advance our clinical programs with strong momentum, a clear focus on execution and a strong balance sheet,\" said Amy Burroughs, chief executive officer of Terns. \"We are on track for two key clinical readouts in CML and obesity by year-end. The fourth quarter data readout from the Phase 1 CARDINAL trial in 2L+ CML will enable comparison of the efficacy and safety results of TERN-701 with data from other Phase 1 CML trials, including asciminib's.\"\n\"We are focusing the company in oncology and on rapidly advancing TERN-701 towards a pivotal trial, with the goal of ultimately bringing a potential best-in-class therapy to people living with CML. The company seeks to partner our portfolio of potentially best-in-class metabolic assets and does not plan to invest in clinical development in metabolic disease beyond year end 2025.\"\n\"We are encouraged by the rapid enrollment in the CARDINAL trial of TERN-701 in CML and initiation of dose expansion at the high end of the dose range based on the safety and efficacy data to date. The recently presented preclinical data at the European Hematology Association Congress (EHA) further supports TERN-701's enhanced potency compared to asciminib across multiple clinically relevant BCR-ABL variants, including those with resistance mutations. These findings build upon previously reported data from the early dose escalation portion of the CARDINAL trial, which showed compelling molecular responses observed in heavily pre-treated patients, including those with treatment failure to asciminib. We look forward to sharing a CARDINAL data set in the fourth quarter that will provide a read through to the primary endpoint in a registrational trial \u2013 the achievement of a major molecular response at six months,\" concluded Ms. Burroughs.\nRecent Pipeline Developments and Anticipated Milestones\nTERN-701: Oral, small-molecule next-generation allosteric BCR-ABL inhibitor for CML\n- Terns plans to report efficacy and safety data from the Phase 1 CARDINAL trial in the fourth quarter of 2025, including 6-month MMR achievement rate, and to inform the potential for a best-in-class product profile and path to a pivotal trial\n- In April 2025, Terns enrolled the first patient in the dose expansion portion of the CARDINAL trial in which patients are randomized to one of two dose cohorts (320 mg or 500 mg QD) with up to 40 patients per arm\n- Doses were selected based on the totality of safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data from the dose escalation portion of the trial\n- Terns to host an educational webinar in September 2025 detailing the unmet need in CML, how TERN-701 is building a potential best-in-class profile and relevant benchmarks for Phase 1 data. Webcast details will be available prior to the event\n- Early interim data released in December 2024 from the TERN-701 dose escalation portion of the CARDINAL trial showed:\n- Compelling molecular responses in heavily pre-treated CML patients with high baseline BCR-ABL transcript levels, starting at the lowest doses\n- Encouraging safety profile with no dose limiting toxicities, adverse event-related treatment discontinuations or dose reductions at any dose\n- In addition, supportive preclinical data presented at EHA 2025 highlighted greater potency of TERN-701 compared to asciminib against several resistance mutations in the active-site and allosteric domains\nTERN-601: Oral, small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1-RA) for obesity\n- Key objectives of the Phase 2 FALCON trial in patients with obesity or overweight are to demonstrate competitive weight loss at 12-weeks, a class-leading safety/tolerability profile, and the simplest dose titration among GLP1-RA therapies\n- The Phase 2 FALCON trial enrollment completed in the second quarter of 2025 and top-line 12-week data is expected in the early fourth quarter of 2025\n- U.S.-based, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TERN-601 as a treatment for obesity\n- Once-daily dosing with or without food in adults with obesity or overweight, without diabetes (BMI ranges from \u226530 to <50 kg/m2 or \u226527 to <30 kg/m2 with at least one weight-related comorbidity)\n- Patients randomized to one of four active cohorts (n=30 per cohort): 250 mg, 500 mg, 500 mg slow titration, 750 mg or placebo\n- Primary endpoint is percent change from baseline in body weight compared to placebo over 12 weeks\n- Secondary endpoints include safety, tolerability and proportion of patients achieving 5% weight loss or greater\n- Doses and titration schema for Phase 2 were selected based on positive results from the Phase 1 trial, announced in September 2024, which demonstrated weight loss over 28-days up to 5.5% and favorable safety and tolerability despite rapid dose titration every three days\n- In June 2025, Terns presented additional data from the completed 28-day Phase 1 trial of TERN-601 for obesity at the 85th Annual American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions, which further demonstrated its differentiated profile among oral GLP1-RAs\nPipeline and Partnering Programs\nTERN-800 Series: Oral, small-molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) modulators\n- Terns is prioritizing its discovery efforts on nominating a GIPR antagonist development candidate based on in-house discoveries and growing scientific rationale supporting the potential of GLP-1 agonist/GIPR antagonist combinations for obesity. Terns is seeking a strategic partner to advance this program\nTERN-501: Oral, thyroid hormone receptor-beta (THR-\u03b2) agonist\n- Based on non-clinical studies, THR-\u03b2 is a complementary mechanism to GLP-1, potentially providing broader metabolic and liver benefits in addition to increased weight loss. Terns is seeking a strategic partner to advance this program\nCorporate Updates\nMembers of the Terns' senior leadership team will participate in the Morgan Stanley 23rd Annual Global Healthcare Conference, taking place in New York City, New York, September 8-10th, 2025.\nWebcasts can be accessed at Terns' IR website: http://ir.ternspharma.com\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial Results\nCash Position: As of June 30, 2025, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $315.4 million, as compared with $358.2 million as of December 31, 2024.

GPCR, a clinical-stage global biopharmaceutical company developing novel oral small molecule therapeutics for metabolic and cardiopulmonary diseases, today announced positive 12-week topline obesity data from its Phase 2a study of GSBR-1290, along with positive topline results from its capsule to tablet PK study. Both studies achieved their primary and secondary objectives.\nTopline Results Summary\n- In the Phase 2a obesity study, GSBR-1290 demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant placebo-adjusted mean decrease in weight of 6.2%1 (p<0.0001) at 12 weeks. At Week 12, 67% of GSBR-1290 treated participants achieved \u22656% weight loss and 33% achieved \u2265 10% weight loss, compared to 0% for placebo.\n- A capsule to tablet PK study designed to explore a new tablet formulation of GSBR-1290 demonstrated a placebo-adjusted mean weight loss of up to 6.9%1 (p<0.0001) with the tablet formulation at 12 weeks. In addition, the tablet formulation demonstrated comparable exposure to the prior capsule formulation and pharmacokinetic data support dose proportional exposure and a once-daily dose profile of GSBR-1290.\n- GSBR-1290 demonstrated generally favorable safety and tolerability results following repeated, daily dosing up to 120mg. As expected for the GLP1-RA drug class, leading adverse events (AEs) were gastrointestinal (GI)-related and the two most common AEs were nausea and vomiting. GI-related adverse events were generally observed early in treatment and attenuated after titration was completed. AE-related study discontinuations ranged from 5% in the Phase 2a obesity study to 11% in the capsule to tablet PK study. There were zero cases of drug-induced liver injury or persistent liver enzyme elevations reported across the two studies.\n\"These topline results demonstrate the substantial weight loss effect of GSBR-1290 and its potential to become a best-in-class oral small molecule GLP-1RA as well as an ideal backbone for future combination therapeutics for the treatment of obesity and related diseases,\" said Raymond Stevens, Ph.D., Founder and CEO of Structure. \"We designed GSBR-1290 to be dosed once-a-day, and are pleased to see the competitive treatment effect at 12 weeks, dose proportional exposure and target engagement over 24 hours.\"\nDr. Stevens continued: \"We are pleased that our new tablet performed well and that a start low and go-slow titration strategy proved beneficial and we will carry these observations into our planned Phase 2b study. As previously reported, we believe our large safety window will allow us the option to explore higher doses in future studies. As a non-peptide small molecule, our large-scale manufacturing process is expected to be more than capable of meeting the anticipated global demand of a product with the profile of GSBR-1290. We are excited to move into a Phase 2b study in overweight and obese individuals. \"\n\"By 2030, the global prevalence of obesity is expected to reach 1 billion. There is a need for oral treatments, including small molecules, which are easier to make at scale, more stable thus easier to transport and store, and more cost-effective,\" said Ania Jastreboff, M.D., Ph.D., Associate Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics at Yale School of Medicine; Director, Yale Obesity Research Center (Y-Weight), and co-Director of the Yale Center for Weight Management. \"All these factors may enable greater treatment reach for this worldwide disease. The phase 2 data with GSBR-1290 demonstrate safety to date and clinically meaningful weight reduction with 12 weeks of treatment and are encouraging for its development as a potential future therapeutic for obesity.\"\nGSBR-1290 Phase 2b Obesity Study Expected to Begin in Fourth Quarter 2024\nStructure plans to submit an IND to the FDA in the third quarter of 2024 to support initiation of trials in chronic weight management and thereafter initiate a Phase 2b obesity study of GSBR-1290 in the fourth quarter of 2024. The 36-week global study is expected to use the tablet formulation of GSBR-1290 and include approximately 300 participants to be treated with multiple doses and dose titration regimens.\nAbout the Phase 2a Study of GSBR-1290 in Obesity\nThe double-blind, 12-week placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial enrolled 64 healthy overweight or obese participants that were randomized to GSBR-1290 120mg (n=37) or placebo (n=27), dosed once daily with weekly dose titrations.\nAbout the GSBR-1290 capsule to tablet PK study\nThe 12-week placebo-controlled capsule to tablet PK study (n=54) was designed to evaluate the tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics of a new tablet formulation of GSBR-1290 and assess three different dosing and titration regimens, while exploring changes in weight during the 12-week duration. Based on the results with the new tablet formulation, Structure anticipates using the tablet formulation for future studies starting with the planned 36-week Phase 2b obesity study.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nStructure will host a conference call and webcast today, June 3, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. A live webcast of the call will be available on the Investor Relations page of Structure's website at https://ir.structuretx.com/events-presentations/events.

See them here\u2192\nThe Trump administration is preparing a pilot program that could allow some Americans on Medicare and Medicaid to access popular and costly weight-loss medications.\nThe plan, still in development, would permit state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans to voluntarily cover GLP-1 drugs such as Novo Nordisk A/S\u2019 NVO Ozempic and Wegovy, and Eli Lilly And Co\u2019s LLY Mounjaro and Zepbound for weight management, according to internal documents reviewed by The Washington Post.\nThe pilot would also include Eli Lilly\u2019s GLP-1 drug Orforglipron, pending its expected approval in 2026.\nThe initiative, set to launch in April 2026 for Medicaid and January 2027 for Medicare, would run through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI).\nThis testing lab explores new payment models to improve care and reduce health care spending.\nWhile Medicare covers these drugs mainly for Type 2 diabetes, some private insurers already approve them for weight loss.\nThe proposal comes after the Trump administration rejected a Biden-era plan to provide coverage of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss under Medicare and Medicaid.\nThough not yet finalized, the Washington Post report on Friday added that the new pilot could move forward without requiring a formal public comment process.\nAlso Read: Congress Sounds Alarm Over Illegal Weight-Loss Drug Imports From China\nCovering these drugs is not without significant cost concerns. The Congressional Budget Office estimates Medicare could spend around $35 billion on GLP-1 coverage for obesity between 2026 and 2034. These medications typically cost $5,000 to $7,000 annually per patient.\nStill, experts like David Rind, chief medical officer at the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, argue the price is reasonable given the potential for substantial health improvements.\nSome states are already moving ahead. Thirteen state Medicaid programs currently cover GLP-1s for obesity, despite looming worries about reduced federal Medicaid funding due to a recent tax law overhaul.\nOn Thursday, Trump issued a 60-day ultimatum to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, demanding that they lower drug prices in the U.S. or face severe consequences.\nTrump urged drugmakers to offer all existing drugs to Medicaid patients at the lowest prices in other developed countries, adopt most-favored-nation pricing for all new drugs across Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payers, and push back against \u201cforeign freeloading nations\u201d in pricing negotiations.\nAlso, Ozempic may enter the realm of price negotiations between drug manufacturers and Medicare.\nOzempic is poised to become eligible for negotiations when the next batch of drugs is chosen in 2025, leading to price adjustments in 2027.\nRead Next:\nPhoto by KK Stock via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "13-Week Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Oral VK2735 Dosed Once Daily\nResults Expected in 2H25\nSAN DIEGO, March 26, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (\"Viking\") VKTX, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders, today announced the completion of subject enrollment in its Phase 2 clinical trial of the oral tablet formulation of VK2735, the company's dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors. VK2375 is being developed in both oral and subcutaneous formulations for the potential treatment of various metabolic disorders such as obesity. Viking expects to report data from the study in the second half of 2025.\nThe Phase 2 VENTURE-Oral Dosing Trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and weight loss efficacy of VK2735 dosed as an oral tablet once daily for 13 weeks. The trial enrolled approximately 280 adults who are obese (BMI \u226530 kg/m2), or adults who are overweight (BMI \u226527 kg/m2) with at least one weight-related co-morbid condition. Enrolled patients have been evenly randomized to one of six dosing arms or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study is the percent change in body weight from baseline after 13 weeks of treatment. Secondary and exploratory endpoints will evaluate a range of additional safety and efficacy measures.\n\"As with our previous Phase 2 study of subcutaneous VK2735, interest in participating in the Phase 2 VENTURE-Oral study was high and drove an efficient rate of enrollment,\" said Brian Lian, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Viking Therapeutics. \"Despite its larger size, VENTURE-Oral was rapidly enrolled, highlighting the continued enthusiasm for new obesity therapeutics such as VK2735. We look forward to reporting data from this trial in the second half of 2025.\"\nViking previously reported positive results from a 28-day Phase 1 multiple ascending dose (MAD) clinical trial of the tablet formulation of VK2735 in healthy volunteers with a BMI \u226530. Cohorts receiving VK2735 demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in mean body weight from baseline, ranging up to 8.2%. Persistent weight loss effects were observed at follow-up visits through Day 57, ranging up to 8.3% from baseline, four weeks after the last dose of VK2735 was administered. An exploratory assessment of the proportion of subjects achieving at least 5% weight loss after 28 days demonstrated that up to 100% of VK2735-treated subjects achieved \u22655% weight loss, compared with 0% for placebo. Based on a preliminary evaluation of weight loss trajectories at multiple dose levels, the company believes that continued treatment beyond 28 days may provide further reductions in body weight.\nIn the MAD trial, oral VK2735 also demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability through 28 days of once-daily dosing at doses up to and including 100 mg. The majority (99%) of observed treatment emergent adverse events were mild or moderate, with the majority (90%) reported as mild. Similarly, all observed gastrointestinal adverse events were reported as mild or moderate, with the majority (84%) reported as mild.\nConcurrent with the development of oral VK2735, Viking is also advancing a subcutaneous formulation of VK2735 through clinical development. The company previously announced positive data from the Phase 2 VENTURE study of subcutaneous VK2735, with the trial successfully achieving its primary and all secondary endpoints. Patients receiving VK2735 demonstrated statistically significant reductions in mean body weight from baseline, ranging up to 14.7%. Statistically significant differences compared to placebo were observed for all doses starting at Week 1 and were maintained throughout the course of the study. Weight loss in all treated cohorts appeared to be progressive through 13 weeks and did not show evidence of plateauing. VK2735 also demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability in the VENTURE study, with the majority of observed adverse events being reported as mild or moderate. The company plans to initiate Phase 3 development with the subcutaneous formulation of VK2735 in the first half of 2025.\nAbout GLP-1 and Dual GLP-1/GIP Agonists\nActivation of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor has been shown to decrease glucose, reduce appetite, lower body weight, and improve insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes, obesity, or both. Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is currently marketed in various dosage strengths and forms as Ozempic\u00ae, Rybelsus\u00ae, and Wegovy\u00ae. More recently, research efforts have explored the potential co-activation of the glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) receptor as a means of enhancing the therapeutic benefits of GLP-1 receptor activation. Tirzepatide is a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is currently marketed in various dosage strengths and forms as Mounjaro\u00ae and Zepbound\u00ae.\nAbout Viking Therapeutics, Inc.\nViking Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel first-in-class or best-in-class therapies for the treatment of metabolic and endocrine disorders, with three compounds currently in clinical trials. Viking's research and development activities leverage its expertise in metabolism to develop innovative therapeutics designed to improve patients' lives. Viking's clinical programs include VK2735, a novel dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors for the potential treatment of various metabolic disorders. Data from a Phase 1 and a Phase 2 trial evaluating VK2735 (dosed subcutaneously) for metabolic disorders demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile as well as positive signs of clinical benefit. Concurrently, the company is evaluating an oral formulation of VK2735 in a Phase 2 trial. Viking is also developing VK2809, a novel, orally available, small molecule selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist for the treatment of lipid and metabolic disorders. The compound successfully achieved both the primary and secondary endpoints in a recently completed Phase 2b study for the treatment of biopsy-confirmed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. In a Phase 2a trial for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and elevated LDL-C, patients who received VK2809 demonstrated statistically significant reductions in LDL-C and liver fat content compared with patients who received placebo. The company's newest program is evaluating a series of internally developed dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonists (or DACRAs) for the treatment of obesity and other metabolic disorders. In the rare disease space, Viking is developing VK0214, a novel, orally available, small molecule selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist for the potential treatment of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). In a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with the adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) form of X-ALD, VK0214 was shown to be safe and well-tolerated, while driving significant reductions in plasma levels of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and other lipids, as compared to placebo.\nFor more information about Viking Therapeutics, please visit www.vikingtherapeutics.com.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding Viking Therapeutics, Inc., under the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about Viking's expectations regarding its clinical and preclinical development programs, anticipated timing for reporting clinical data and cash resources.

VKTX, Eli Lilly And Co LLY and Novo Nordisk A/S NVO stocks are trading higher on Monday.\nPfizer Inc. PFE announced on Monday that it will discontinue the development of danuglipron (PF-06882961), an oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist being investigated for chronic weight management.\nA single asymptomatic participant in one of the dose-optimization studies experienced potential drug-induced liver injury, which resolved after discontinuation of danuglipron.\nPfizer is one of several drugmakers working to develop an alternative to injectable weight loss drugs. Still, it\u2019s far behind rivals like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, who already lead the market with weekly injections.\nEli Lilly is developing orforglipron, which could be the first small-molecule weight-loss pill when it launches in 2026. This would give Eli Lilly a two-year lead before rivals catch up.\nIn March, Viking Therapeutics completed subject enrollment in its Phase 2 clinical trial of the oral tablet formulation of VK2735, the company\u2019s dual agonist of the GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors.\nVK2375 is being developed in oral and subcutaneous formulations for various metabolic disorders, such as obesity. Viking expects to report data from the study in the second half of 2025.\nViking plans to initiate Phase 3 development with the subcutaneous formulation of VK2735 in the first half of 2025.\nIn June 2024, Structure Therapeutics Inc. GPCR unveiled 12-week topline obesity data from its Phase 2a study of GSBR-1290.\nIn the Phase 2a obesity study, GSBR-1290 demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant placebo-adjusted mean decrease in weight of 6.2% at 12 weeks.\nIn July 2024, Roche Holdings AG RHHBY announced topline results from two arms of an ongoing multi-part Phase 1 clinical trial for CT-996 for type 2 diabetes and obesity.\nThe data showed that treatment with CT-996 in participants with obesity and without type 2 diabetes resulted in a clinically meaningful placebo-adjusted mean weight loss of -6.1% within four weeks.\nThis data is better compared to existing competitors.\nIn June 2023, Pfizer discontinued the clinical development of another GLP-1-RA candidate, lotiglipron (PF-07081532), due to pharmacokinetic data from Phase 1 studies and laboratory measurements of elevated transaminases (liver enzymes).\nIn March, Altimmune Inc ALT unveiled the first disclosure of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and Alcohol Liver Disease (ALD) as potential developments for its obesity drug, pemvidutide.\nPhase 2 trials for pemvidutide in AUD and ALD are expected to start in the second and third quarters of 2025, respectively.\nPrice Action: LLY stock is up 1.14% at $739.26, NVO stock is up 1.68% at $65.82, ALT stock is up 3.40% at $4.56, VKTX stock is up 13.5% at $25.21\nGPCR stock is up 8.36% at $17.23 at the last check on Monday.\nRead Next:\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

REDEFINE 11 will explore further weight loss potential and safety of CagriSema 2.4 mg / 2.4 mg through a longer trial duration and other protocol changes compared to REDEFINE 1 and 2.\nMarket Reaction\nNVO experienced a decline of over 7% in premarket trading on Monday; the market\u2019s reaction suggests that Novo Nordisk\u2019s CagriSema has been perceived to have a less favorable side effect profile when compared to Eli Lilly And Co\u2019s LLY orforglipron.\nIn Eli Lilly\u2019s ACHIEVE-1 trial, the most common adverse events for participants treated with orforglipron (3 mg, 12 mg and 36 mg, respectively) were diarrhea (19%, 21% and 26%) vs. 9% with placebo, nausea (13%, 18% and 16%) vs. 2% with placebo, dyspepsia (11%, 20% and 15%) vs. 7% with placebo, constipation (8%, 17% and 14%) vs. 4% with placebo, and vomiting (5%, 7% and 14%) vs. 1% with placebo.\nIn REDEFINE 1, adverse events were mainly gastrointestinal (79.6% in the CagriSema group vs. 39.9% with placebo), including nausea (55% vs. 12.6 %), constipation (30.7% vs. 11.6%), vomiting (26.1% vs. 4.1%) and mainly were transient and mild-to-moderate in severity.\nAdding to the investor concerns, William Blair analysts expressed disappointment, stating, \u201cWe had hoped that the amylin component could provide a higher magnitude of weight loss among patients living with type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, the hypothesis did not come to fruition, and in our view, there is no evidence to suggest CagriSema should be prescribed over Zepbound in any subpopulation, based on the available data released to date.\u201d\nAnalyst Andy Hsieh further elaborated that the \u201chigh frequency of adverse events could fuel uncertainty over the asset\u2019s differentiation against approved (Zepbound) or late-stage investigational (retatrutide and MariTide) compounds.\u201d\nPrice Action: At the last check on Monday, NVO stock was down 7.10% to $68.53 during the premarket session.\nRead Next:\n- Eli Lilly\u2019s Investigational Oral Pill Shows Weight Loss Benefits With Lingering Side Effect Concerns\nImage via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

  "argos_summary": "Eli Lilly's orforglipron, an investigational oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, showed a 12.4% average weight loss in a Phase 3 trial, falling short of the expected 15%. This underperformance has opened opportunities for competitors like Novo Nordisk, Terns Pharmaceuticals, Viking Therapeutics, and Structure Therapeutics, which are advancing their own weight-loss therapies. Analysts suggest that Lilly's setback could allow smaller biopharma firms to gain market traction, particularly as they prepare for upcoming data releases and trials.",
