      "feedback": "The draft rightly centers tariffs and enforcement as the dominant macro transmission, but the chain is under-structured and under-quantified for a 3–6 month horizon; sharpen the causal thread (policy → enforcement intensity → tariff passthrough and supply-chain reconfiguration → earnings/price signals) and anchor every link to a specific source ID. Actionable edits: (1) Build a tight 3–6 month scenario map with explicit triggers and invalidation: base case (tariffs remain elevated with ongoing DOJ enforcement and appellate stays into late summer–fall 2025), alt 1 (Supreme Court ruling in favor of presidential authority or a quick bilateral deal that narrows tariff exposure within 3–6 months), alt 2 (no quick resolution, plus accelerated UK/CUSMA-alignment pressures that reprice cross-border costs). Tie each scenario to timing windows (oral arguments July 31; potential fall decision; early 2026 UK DCTS implementation; CUSMA-origin rulings). (2) Enrich the catalyst/invalidation set with precise counts and flows: quantify Goodyear-like tariff headwinds (about $350m annualized tariff costs; ~$4 pass-through per tire; $180m Q3 headwind guidance) and connect them to margins/volumes where possible (AJTHKYXQ3). (3) Deepen scenario sensitivity to cross-border sourcing shifts: UK DCTS Asia Regional Cumulation Group enabling 100% inputs sourcing with zero UK tariffs for Sri Lankan apparel; cite the 20.4% UK export rise to $67.33m in June 2025 and 5.2% Sri Lankan apparel export growth to $439.39m (WLXM1819K). Translate this into implied risk-adjusted beta to apparel sectors and to UK demand pipelines. (4) Ground inflation/transmission claims with a clear, source-backed stance: tariffs affect targeted sectors and the aggregate inflation impulse is modest, so model sectoral price pressure and spillovers, not a macro CPI shock; avoid vague statements, and, where you cite, attach IDs (e.g., OFY11YO0I for enforcement posture; WLXM1819K for DCTS-related UK-Sri Lanka dynamics; AJTHKYXQ3 for Goodyear flows). (5) Prune or relocate nonessential items (e.g., the MacBook/iPhone-content threads) to avoid dilution; if retained for cross-asset flavor, explicitly justify relevance to tariff-policy transmission and tag with an ID or replace with a tariff-relevant alternate source. (6) Strengthen quantification: present a base-case earnings/price-path (e.g., tariff pass-through, input-cost shifts, and any expected demand changes) and 1–2 alternate paths with plausible ranges, always anchored to the numbers in the sources. (7) Citation discipline: attach a precise ID after every factual assertion drawn from the sources (base-case numbers from AJTHKYXQ3; Asia DCTS and Sri Lanka data from WLXM1819K; enforcement posture from OFY11YO0I); where cross-border rulings or legal timelines are invoked, reference the relevant source with a proper ID and ensure no uncited material is used. The result should end with a base case, 1–2 alts, a clearly defined watch-list of signals (court decisions by July–Fall 2025; DCTS implementation timing; CUSMA-origin determinations; Sri Lanka UK export-flow shifts), and a stated confidence level.",
