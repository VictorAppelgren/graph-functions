  "content": "Taco Bell has brought back another fan favorite to its menu: Cheesy Street Chalupas.\n\nCheesy Street Chalupas, which made their debut in July 2024, are back on the menu, the company announced on Aug. 14. The dish comes filled with either slow-roasted chicken or grilled, marinated steak, then topped with onions and cilantro in a warm shell. The shell, inspired by Taco Bell's Quesalupa, is stuffed with melted mozzarella and pepperjack cheese.\n\nInfluenced by street tacos, Cheesy Street Chalupas come in twos for $5.49 (available at participating locations nationwide for a limited time, while supplies last). You can also get two Cheesy Street Chalupas in a $9 Luxe Cravings Box, which also includes a Cheesy Bean and Rice Burrito, chips with nacho cheese sauce and a medium fountain drink.\n\nThe returning Cheesy Street Chalupa is \"a beloved item that\u2019s sure to reignite the appetites of its devoted fans,\" according to Insider Foodie.\n\nTaco Bell first tested the Cheesy Street Chalupa in October 2023 in Indianapolis before making it available nationwide last summer. Earlier this year, Taco Bell also served up a Toasted Cheddar Street Chalupa. These dishes are new twists on the Chalupa, which originally debuted in 1999.\n\n\u201cWe draw inspiration from all parts of the culinary world but for Cheesy Street Chalupas, we looked to the innovative spirit of street food culture. This menu item embodies that same passion for fusion and bold flavors in way that still feels uniquely Taco Bell,\" said Luis Restrepo, Taco Bell\u2019s vice president of product innovation.\n\nTaco Bell has also supported street vendors in Southern California by providing 46 vending carts to local food purveyors, as part of a partnership with Revolution Carts.\n\nMore new items on Taco Bell's menu\n\nJoining the permanent menu on Aug. 14 is the Mountain Dew Baja Midnight, a new purple-tinged, passionfruit-flavored addition to its popular Mountain Dew Baja Blast lineup.\n\nAlso available: the new $3 Grilled Steak Burrito, which can be ordered with Cheesy Melt or Chipotle Ranch flavor finishes.\n\nMike Snider is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Farmers' Almanac winter forecast for 2025-2026: A long season of cold, snow across US\nThe upcoming 2025-2026 winter may not be as brutal as last year's season, which led to record-setting cold temperatures, the Farmers' Almanac says. But expect plenty of snow and wintery weather.\nAfter winter 2024-2025 brought record-breaking snowfall and dangerously cold temperatures to parts of the U.S., an \"old-fashioned winter,\" as forecast by the Farmers' Almanac may be welcome news for farmers \u2013 and the rest of us, too.\nThe 209th edition of the Farmers' Almanac, out now, forecasts \"Chill, Snow, Repeat\" weather patterns for the upcoming 2025-2026 winter season.\nThe cold and snow may not reach as far south as last year, but the Northern Plains to the New England are likely in for a cold, snowy winter, \"hopefully not as brutally cold as last,\" Farmers' Almanac Editor Sandi Duncan told USA TODAY.\n\"Most of the country is on tap for a cold or very cold winter, kind of almost going back to an old-fashioned winter,\" Duncan said. \"It's going to cool down, it's going to snow, then it might warm up a little, then it's going to repeat itself again.\"\nEven though the upcoming winter may not bring a repeat of last year's prolonged bone-chilling temperatures, the upcoming season's expected weather cycle means \"this winter\u2019s shaping up to be a wild ride,\" the Almanac predicts.\nWintery effects may begin in late fall as cold winter temperatures could \"sneak in a little bit early in many of the northern sections,\" Duncan said.\nWhile winter doesn't officially start until Dec. 21, \"we do see some very cold conditions, kind of blowing in with some possible snow in some areas,\" she said. \"I think the greatest chance of a White Christmas would be out in the northern Plains, perhaps, but not too many other places.\"\nWinter could linger, too. \"It looks like it's going to hang on for a little bit through March and even through April \u2026 especially in New England, Great Lakes and the northern Plains,\" Duncan said.\nDid the Farmers' Almanac get its winter weather prediction right last year?\nIn part, the Almanac proffers, mentioning in the new edition how its winter 2024-2025 forecast \"for a mild winter in Texas and the Southern Plains hit the mark, and we correctly called the cold weather over the Northern Plains and Great Lakes.\"\nThe Almanac also notes, \"We also accurately forewarned of a very cold spell at the end of January,\" perhaps referencing some of winter 2024-2025's milestones including the arctic air mass that contributed to cold weather advisories that month. \"But La Ni\u00f1a threw a curveball, leaving us with fewer wet weather events than expected,\" the Almanac said.\nFebruary also brought dangerously cold temperatures but overall, the contiguous U.S. had the third warmest winter on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with an average temperature of 34.1 degrees F, 1.9 degrees above average.\nThere's a chance a La Ni\u00f1a winter could be in store, according to the Climate Prediction Center. That could mean cold and snow for the Northwest, dry conditions in the South, and higher-than-average temperatures in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.\nThe Farmers' Almanac creates its forecasts \"using a proprietary formula that adapts to the mysteries of nature and the ever-changing world in which we live,\" this edition notes. \"The basis of our prediction method was developed by our founding editor according to correlations between celestial events and various meteorological conditions.\"\nWhile scientists may question the accuracy of The Farmers' Almanac \u2013 and the competing The Old Farmer's Almanac \u2013 the guide, which includes planting tips and an astronomical calendar, remains an interesting read.\nHere's a closer look at its regional winter forecasts.\nNortheast, New York: 'Active time' for storms in late January\nWinter in the New England and the Northeast region (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont) will include a \"cold snap\" around Jan. 8-15, especially in New England, but \"leaking down into some of the more northern Mid-Atlantic states,\" Duncan said.\nNew England, along with the Northern Plains, is expected to bear the brunt of the season\u2019s coldest temperatures, according to the Almanac.\nIn mid-January, the Almanac expects \"some pretty good snowstorms in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and southern New York \u2026 (and) then again in February, between the 8th and the 11th, we're calling for some very cold conditions, with some heavy snow in northern New England.\"\nMilder temperatures in early March will be followed by colder temperatures and cold, gusty winds in the middle of the month, the Almanac says.\nMidwest, Ohio, and Michigan: 'Big freeze' in January\nIn the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Midwest region (Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin), New Year's Day will bring chilly, breezy temperatures; northern Michigan and Wisconsin can expect snow.\nAs in the Northeast, the region will get cold temperatures \"perhaps blowing down from the north, especially in Indiana and northern Michigan,\" Duncan said. \"And we're calling for a pretty big snowstorm\" in the Great Lakes region from February 8-11. As the snow gives way to very cold temperatures there, snow moves into Kentucky and Ohio. The beginning of March brings snow to most of the region. The month ends with brisk, windy conditions, plus snow in the north.\nNorthwest: Rain and wet snow for Idaho, Oregon and Washington\nGood news for skiers in the Northwest region (Idaho, Oregon and Washington) because there's overall chilly and wet conditions expected this winter. \"the wet conditions obviously in the mountains are going to help that snow pack \u2026 (for) skiing,\" Duncan said.\nThe Pacific Northwest\u2019s mountains \"are gearing up for some impressive snowfall totals,\" the Almanac says.\nFor coastal Washington in the middle of February and March, \"we're calling for a lot of wet conditions, especially along the coast,\" with rainstorms, Duncan said.\nNorth Central states, Colorado: 'More like winter'\nThe North Central states (Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming), along with the Great Lakes region, \"are set for a classic winter wonderland,\" the Almanac says.That means the region can expect a \"very cold and snowy\" winter, Duncan said. Snowstorms are expected mid-February in Kansas and Nebraska and in mid-March in the Central Plains.\nEaster may even bring light snow to the Dakotas and Minnesota, while it will be chilly but clear in Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri.\nSoutheast, Florida: 'Mild and wet' winter\nWinter is expected to bring average temperatures and wet conditions in the Southeast states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia), according to the Almanac.\nThe second week of January will bring \"some very cold temperatures with some possible wintry precipitation, in the more northern areas, such as the mountains of West Virginia and Virginia,\" Duncan said.\nFebruary will also be \"a very wet period, especially from the 16th to the 20th, then turning mild at the end of February, but unsettled in many places,\" she said. \"So just very wet, I would say, is the focus.\"\nTexas, South Central: Another winter snowstorm predicted\nCold and wet conditions are expected this winter in the South Central states (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico) and Texas, too. \"We don't see too much snow, but we're feeling like some of these more northern areas in this region may have icy rain and the cold conditions, so you might want to make sure you have deicer and your boots ready,\" Duncan said.\nNorthern Texas could get snow and freezing rain in mid-January and snow again in mid-February and mid-March, according to the Almanac. Mild weather will arrive as the month of March nears its end.\nCalifornia, Southwest: 'Fair, dry, very chilly' Christmas\nSouthwest states (Arizona, California, Nevada \\, and Utah) are forecast to have average temperatures and wet conditions \u2013 weather that could help prevent a repeat of the January wildfires in California, Duncan said.\nCalifornia is expected to get rain ahead of windy conditions at the end of January. \"Hopefully it will be enough moisture in the air in California that we don't see anything crazy like it was last year,\" Duncan said.\nOverall, the region should have a \"nice winter with not too many extremes,\" she said.\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\nMike Snider is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

This limited-time offering stands out not just for its crunch and cheese-laden appeal but also as part of the chain\u2019s $9 Luxe Cravings Box, a testament to Taco Bell\u2019s knack for creating crave-worthy combinations as reported by Nation\u2019s Restaurant News. The return of this fan favorite promises to add a deliciously familiar twist to the fast-food landscape.\nThe Cheesy Street Chalupa\u2019s resurrection taps into the powerful trend of nostalgia in dining, where familiar flavors evoke fond memories and a sense of comfort. Taco Bell\u2019s decision to bring back this particular item underscores their understanding of consumer desires for both novelty and nostalgia. It\u2019s a strategic move that not only celebrates the brand\u2019s rich history but also engages a new generation of customers eager to experience or relive the cheesy, crunchy delight.\nThis move by Taco Bell begs the question: In a world constantly seeking the next big culinary innovation, do we find ourselves yearning for the flavors of the past to guide our future?

      "text": "Tropical Storm Erin forecast to become first hurricane of Atlantic season\nTropical Storm Erin in the eastern Atlantic Ocean could eventually develop into a \"major hurricane,\" federal forecasters said.\nEditor's Note: Tropical Storm Erin is expected to strengthen into a hurricane. See the latest update on Tuesday, Aug. 12.\nTropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is on track to become the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, meteorologists said.\nThe National Hurricane Center in Miami announced on Monday, Aug. 11, that Erin had developed from a tropical wave as it churned west of the Cabo Verde Islands, an archipelago that sits off the western coast of Africa.\nAs of 11 a.m., the storm was moving west at 20 mph and had sustained winds of 45 mph, the hurricane center said. The storm was located 280 miles west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands and over 2,300 miles from the Leeward Islands.\nThe storm is expected to continue strengthening as it barrels west over the coming days. The hurricane center said several regional models \"show Erin becoming a major hurricane,\" which is defined as any storm classified as a Category 3 or stronger, meaning it has winds over 110 mph.\nErin was one of three disturbances meteorologists were tracking in the Atlantic \u2013 and is the one that poses the biggest threat. It is still early and there are high levels of uncertainty in the storm's long-term track. Still, experts urge those with interests in the Caribbean and the eastern coast of the U.S. to monitor its development.\nWarm Atlantic waters to fuel Erin's development into a hurricane\nAs Tropical Storm Erin heads west, it will encounter exceptionally warm waters that could fuel its development into a major hurricane, said AccuWeather's lead hurricane expert Alex DaSilva.\nWater temperatures across much of the Atlantic \"are plenty warm to support tropical development and even rapid intensification,\" DaSilva said in an online outlook.\nHe added that there are several factors that could influence where the storm eventually lands, including the strength of a cold front moving off the eastern coast of the U.S.\nIf the cold front is fast and strong, it could push the storm back out to sea and away from the U.S., DaSilva said. If it's slow and weak, the storm could push right through it and pose a threat to the Eastern Seaboard. Other factors include wind shear and the position of the \"Bermuda High,\" an area of high pressure that could steer the hurricane. So far, it's too early to know where the storm will go.\nStorm tracker: Tracking storms in the Atlantic\nSpaghetti models for Tropical Storm Erin\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\nForecasters track 2 other disturbances in the Atlantic\nApart from Tropical Storm Erin, meteorologists are tracking two systems in the Atlantic Ocean.\nIn the central Atlantic, a weak trough of low pressure with a low chance of developing is expected to drift northward. The disturbance is \"only producing limited shower and thunderstorm activity,\" the hurricane center said.\nMeanwhile, a few hundreds miles off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, a system was tracked moving north over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. By midweek, forecasters say the system will encounter cooler waters, \"ending its chances for further tropical development.\"\nBoth systems have a 10% chance of developing over the next week, according to the National Hurricane Center.\nWhat is happening in the Pacific?\nHurricane Henriette, located north of Hawaii, is forecasted to remain a hurricane for several more days before dissipating into a storm and disappearing before it makes landfall, according to the National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center.\nTropical Depression Ivo, located west of Mexico, is also forecast to dissipate by Tuesday, Aug. 12, before making landfall.\nStorm tracker: Tracking storms in the Pacific\nWhen did the 2025 hurricane season begin?\nThe Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 and will last through the end of November.\nActive hurricane weather typically peaks between mid-August and mid-October.\nHow do hurricanes form?\nHurricanes are born in the tropics, above warm water. Clusters of thunderstorms can develop over the ocean when water temperatures exceed 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If conditions are right, the clusters swirl into a storm known as a tropical wave or tropical depression.\nA tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm once its sustained wind speeds reaches 39 mph. When its winds reach 74 mph, the storm officially becomes a hurricane.\nPrepare now for hurricanes\nDelaying potentially life-saving preparations could mean waiting until it\u2019s too late. \"Get your disaster supplies while the shelves are still stocked, and get that insurance checkup early, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period,\" NOAA recommends.\n- Develop an evacuation plan: If you are at risk from hurricanes, you need an evacuation plan. Now is the time to begin planning where you would go and how you would get there.\n- Assemble disaster supplies: Whether you\u2019re evacuating or sheltering in place, you\u2019re going to need supplies not just to get through the storm but for the potentially lengthy aftermath, NOAA said.\n- Get an insurance checkup and document your possessions: Contact your insurance company or agent now and ask for an insurance check-up to make sure you have enough insurance to repair or even replace your home and/or belongings. Remember, home and renters insurance doesn\u2019t cover flooding, so you\u2019ll need a separate policy. Flood insurance is available through your company, agent or the National Flood Insurance Program. Act now, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period.\n- Create a family communication plan: NOAA said to take the time now to write down your hurricane plan, and share it with your family. Determine family meeting places, and make sure to include an out-of-town location in case of evacuation.\n- Strengthen your home: Now is the time to improve your home\u2019s ability to withstand hurricane impacts. Trim trees; install storm shutters, accordion shutters and/or impact glass; seal outside wall openings.\nContributing: Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida\nJulia is a trending reporter for USA TODAY.

Trump cited the law in an executive order declaring he was using emergency powers to seize control of the city\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\u201cThe Home Rule charter requires the mayor to provide the services of MPD during special conditions of an emergency, and we will follow the law,\u201d Bowser.\n-Zac Anderson\nDOJ earlier said DC violent crime was at a 30-year low\nDespite claims of rising crime and violence in Washington by President Trump and his attorney general and FBI chief, the Justice Department itself announced in January that total violent crime for 2024 was down 35% from the year before.\nIn fact, crime in the capital \u201cis the lowest it has been in over 30 years,\u201d according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department included in a Jan. 3 statement by the Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\nThen-U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, credited the declines to a \"focus on the drivers of violence \u2212 those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed.\u201d\nDuring an August 11 press conference, DC was described as one of the most unsafe and violent cities in the world by Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Graves\u2019 recently confirmed replacement, former television personality Jeanine Pirro.\nBut the Justice Department in January said that in addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides were down 32%; robberies were down 39%; armed carjackings were down 53% and assaults with a dangerous weapon were down 27% when compared with 2023 levels. DOJ also said the District was reporting \u201cthe fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\u201d\nIn 2024, Washington, DC,had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit.\n\u2212Josh Meyer\nTrump says on police response to protesters: \u2018You spit and we hit\u2019\nPresident Trump issued a stern warning to protesters in Washington, DC, and beyond during his Aug. 11 press briefing where he announced plans to federalize the city's police force and deploy National Guard troops: \u201cYou spit and we hit.\u201d\nIn making the remark, Trump said that he was aware of a recent incident in Navy Yard, a neighborhood located in southeast DC. Police arrested a minor on Aug. 9 who discharged a firearm at a group of teens, according to ABC 7 News.\nNavy Yard has seen other incidents of violence in the past, including fights breaking out among teens and a 25-year-old arrested and charged with assault on a police officer.\n\u201cThey're not going to be fighting back long,\u201d Trump said,\nApparently recalling previous street protests where officers showed restraint against demonstrators, Trump called on officers to use force.\n\u201cThey love to spit in the face of the police as the police are standing up there in uniform, they're standing and they're screaming at them an inch away from their face, and then they start spitting in their face. And I said you tell them, \u2018You spit and we hit,'\" Trump said. \u201cAnd they can hit real hard. It's a disgusting thing.\"\n\u2212Sudiksha Kochi\n\u2018Political theater,\u2019 says top Democrat\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sharply criticized President Trump\u2019s takeover of the Washington D.C. police department as \u201cpolitical theater,\u201d and said the nation\u2019s capital doesn\u2019t need it because it\u2019s already reducing violent crime.\n\"What the president did this morning was political theater,\u201d said Durbin, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\u201cHis idea of federalizing the police force of D.C. ignores the reality,\u201d Durbin said at a news conference to discuss the Texas state House Democrats who are boycotting a Trump-backed push to redraw congressional districts.\n\u201cThey are making dramatic progress in reducing violent crime in D.C., so it's a typical move by this president to create chaos and uncertainty, and to draw the attention from other issues like Jeffrey Epstein,\" added Durbin, a longtime Democratic leader who that he will retire and not seek reelection in 2026.\n\u2212Josh Meyer\nTrump says he's looking at downgrading marijuana\nPresident Donald Trump said his administration is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\n\"We're looking at reclassification and we'll make a determination over the next few weeks,\" Trump said during his Aug. 11 press conference.\nThough 45 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, the federal government still classifies it as a Schedule I drug.\n-Sarah Wire\nTrump longs for completed White House ballroom\nPresident Trump brought up his plans to build a 90,000-square-foot ballroom in the White House to the overflowing room of journalists packed into his Aug. 11 media briefing.\n\u201cI would've certainly loved to have had it today,\" the president said of the construction project that isn't slated to be completed until 2029. \"We would've filled it up.\"\n\u2212Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\nHegseth to 'work with state governors' to use more National Guard troops\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth is authorized to \"work with state governors\" to use their states' National Guard troops \"if necessary\" to deploy Washington, D.C., according to Will Scharf, an aide to President Donald Trump.\nHegseth got the green light in the presidential memo that Trump signed directing National Guard troops into Washington, Scharf said. For National Guard troops from states other than the District of Columbia to carry out law enforcement actions, they must be deployed with the consent of their states' governor. - Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nTrump signs executive orders driving DC crackdown\nTrump signed two executive orders earlier in the day as part of his federal crackdown on Washington crime, White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf said.\nOne order invoked Section 40 of the Home Rule Act to allow the Trump administration to take control of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department\nSeparately, Trump signed a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy National Guard troops in Washington. He said the memorandum also authorized Hegseth to work with governors of other states to utilize their National Guards as well.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\nTrump: 800 D.C. National Guard troops will be mobilized\nPresident Donald Trump said 800 troops from the Washington, D.C., National Guard will be mobilized. He said more could be tapped to join them.\n\"If necessary we're going to move servicemembers directly to joining the guardsmen,\" he said.\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nTroops will be 'flowing into the streets of Washington'\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Washington, D.C., National Guard was mobilized the morning of August 11 at President Trump's direction.\n\"You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming weeks,\" Hegseth said. Hegseth said other National Guard units and \"specialized units\" stood ready.\n\"They will be strong. They will be tough,\" he said.\n\"We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement to ensure this city is safe, this city is beautiful.\"\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n'It\u2019s embarrassing,' Trump says of DC crime before Putin summit\nAs he announced the federal takeover of Washington, D.C., police, Trump said he didn\u2019t want to be talking the subject days before his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\u201cThis is a tragic emergency. And it's embarrassing for me to be up here,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm gonna see Putin. I'm going to Russia on Friday. I don't like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capitol was with graffiti all over the walls.\u201d\nThe leaders are scheduled to meet on Aug. 15 in Alaska to discuss an end to the three-year Russian war on Ukraine, in the first in-person meeting since Trump took office for his second term.\n\u2212Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\nTrump puts new DEA chief in charge of DC police\nTrump announced that Drug Enforcement Administrator Terrance Cole will take over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be designated as the interim federal commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Department, okay?\u201d Trump told Cole, standing on the stage with him. \u201cAnd you run them tough, they're good. You have a lot of good people.\u201d\nCole was sworn in as DEA administrator on July 23, following his Senate confirmation.\n-Josh Meyer\nTrump declares public safety emergency, says Bondi will take command of DC police\nTrump said he is declaring a public safety emergency in Washington D.C. and announced Attorney General Pam Bondi will take command of the local Metropolitan Police Department.\nTrump said his new DEA administrator Terry Cole will serve as interim federal commissioner of the police department.\nTrump said he will notify Congress and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser about the moves.\n\u201cThis is an emergency. This is a tragic emergency,\u201d Trump said.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump suggests crime crackdown could extend to other US cities\nTrump seemed to suggest he could later pursue federal intervention to combat crime in places like Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to lose our cities over this,\u201d Trump said as he railed against what he called rising crime rates. \u201cAnd this will go further. We\u2019re starting very strongly with D.C., and we\u2019re going to clean it up real quick, very quickly.\u201d\nTrump was flanked by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as he gave his remarks.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\nTrump says he\u2019s deploying National Guard, taking control of police department\nTrump said he is sending National Guard troops to Washington D.C. and placing Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control to crack down on crime in the nation\u2019s capital.\nTrump cited authority under Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to take control of Washington\u2019s police department.\n\u201cThis is liberation day in D.C.,\" Trump said, touting his moves as \u201chistoric action to rescue our nation from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.\u201d\n\u2212Joey Garrison\nSen. Mike Lee: Time to take over DC\nAhead of Trump\u2019s press conference, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said now is the time for Congress to take control of the city.\n\u201cWe should pass the BOWSER Act in September and return full control of Washington to Congress,\u201d Lee said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\nThe legislation, dubbed \u201cBringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident\u201d was introduced earlier this year, and was named after D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser as a criticism of crime and alleged corruption.\nLee cited an ongoing scandal, for example, involving a D.C. police commander who in July was suspended for allegedly changing crime stats in his district. He also noted how in some news reports local residents said they were afraid to speak out about crime for fear of reprisal.\n\u2212Phillip M. Bailey, Deborah Berry\nWhite House says DC\u2019s murder rate leads other national capitals\nAhead of Trump\u2019s press conference, White House officials handed a chart to reporters in the press briefing room detailing how Washington D.C.\u2019s homicide rate is greater than those of several foreign capitals.\nWith about 27 murders per every 100,000 residents, Washington, D.C., has a higher homicide rate than Bogota, Colombia; Mexico City; Islamabad, Pakistan; Lima, Peru; and Ottawa, Canada, among others, according to the chart.\nEven so, violent crime in Washington D.C. is down 26% in 2025 compared to this time last year. In 2024, Washington, D.C., had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit, at 27.3 per 100,000 residents, a decline of 30.7% from 2023.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump's expected troop deployment recalls 2020 protest crackdown\nPresident Trump's expected announcement that he will send the military onto the streets of the nation's capital recalls his deployment of National Guard troops during his first term to suppress protests sparked by the police murder of George Floyd.\nTrump has threatened a massive crackdown on crime in Washington.\nNational Guard troops mobilized by the president in a \"federalized\" capacity are typically barred from carrying out the functions of law enforcement, but not if they're under state control. In the summer of 2020, Trump brought troops into Washington from other states under the permission of 11 governors \u2212 an unprecedented mobilization of state troops.\nTrump's authority to direct National Guard troops was challenged earlier this year after he tapped the California National Guard to quell protests over widespread deportations in the Los Angeles area. After Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Trump's control over the troops, a judge ruled in favor of Trump.\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nDemocrats ask: What about Jan. 6?\nAhead of Trump's press conference, Democrats criticized Trump for failing to call in the National Guard during the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, while preparing to call in the military now to suppress street crime.\nMore than 1,575 people were charged in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection. At least 600 were charged with the felony of assaulting or impeding law enforcement, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\u201cRemember January 6, 2021: Why did Trump fail to call out to DC National Guard? Don\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s lies,\u201d Donna Brazile, former acting chair of the Democratic National Committee, wrote on X.\nWashington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department.\n-Sudiksha Kochi, Josh Meyer and Zac Anderson\nNo DC crime surge, mayor says\nA spokesman for Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser declined to comment ahead of Trump\u2019s news conference.\nBut during an Aug. 10 appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d Bowser pushed back at Trump\u2019s claims of rising crime in Washington. \u201cWe are not experiencing a crime spike,\u201d the mayor said.\nBowser expressed concern about sending the National Guard into the capital, noting that Guard troops are not meant to enforce local laws.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about them not being used efficiently. And I just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our guard,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the president\u2019s call about how to deploy the guard.\u201d\nBowser, who is in her third mayoral term, has refrained from responding with hostility to Trump\u2019s threats about taking over Washington.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n450 federal officers deployed on DC streets\nTrump's announcement comes as 450 officers from multiple federal agencies were deployed in high-traffic D.C. areas and other hotspots over the weekend on Aug. 9 and 10.\nThe officers are from 18 agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Secret Service.\nTrump ordered an increased law enforcement presence in D.C. on Aug. 8 after complaining about crime in the city, even as violent crime trended down.\nViolent crime is down 26% in DC in 2025\nThe White House pointed to several examples of violent crime in Washington this year including the May 21 fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a downtown museum (The suspect is from Chicago.) as well as the recent assault on Coristine.\nYet Washington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department. Violent crime declined by 35% in Washington from 2023 ro 2024, including homicides from 274 to 187.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump threatens to take over DC\nTrump has long denigrated Washington, D.C, which leans heavily Democratic. Last week, Trump threatened to take over governance of the district if the crime situation isn't improved \u2012 something he floated previously in February.\n\"If D.C. doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they\u2019re not going to get away with it anymore,\" Trump said in an Aug. 5 post on Truth Social.\nSuch action would require approval by Congress.\nThe District of Columbia is a federal enclave under jurisdiction of the U.S. government. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 gave the city local governance, including an elected mayor and city council. Two congressional Republicans, Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, this month introduced legislation to repeal the Home Rule Act.\n-Joey Garrison\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

Some content creators have shared their experiences at their local Olive Garden locations, but understandably, some are skeptical.\n\"I haven\u2019t been inside of Olive Garden for years because I don\u2019t like the quality of their food, but okay, Olive Garden did something with this 25-cent wine tasting. I was able to taste all the wine I was interested in,\" a content creator who goes by Kay's KK said in a recent TikTok video. In her video, she shows that she tried six wine samples for a total of about $1.60.\nSo what's the deal \u2013 does Olive Garden offer wine for just a quarter?\nDoes Olive Garden offer 25-cent wine samples?\nIt's complicated.\nOlive Garden does offer complimentary 1-ounce samples of wine to guests 21 and up with their meal. In some states, this sample is free. But in other states, where free alcohol samples are not permitted, these start at 25 cents, Jaime Bunker, Olive Garden senior vice president of marketing, told USA TODAY.\nThe samples aren't a full glass, though. In comparison to the 1-ounce sample, a traditional glass of wine is 5 ounces, according to New York-based wine retailer Millesima.\nHow many 25-cent wine samples is one guest limited to?\nGuests are welcome to a \"few\" wine samples with their meal, Bunker said. She did not specify the exact number of samples a guest is limited to.\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY. Story idea? Email her at gcross@usatoday.com."

      "text": "'Sounded like thunder': Explosion at US Steel plant in Pennsylvania leaves 2 dead\nCLAIRTON, PA \u2212 Officials confirmed a second fatality in the steel plant explosion on the outskirts of Pittsburgh on Monday that sent 10 people to the hospital.\nAllegheny County Emergency Services and the Allegheny County Police Department responded to the blasts at the U.S. Steel Clairton Coke Works plant in Clairton and confirmed the first fatality that afternoon in a social media statement. A large initial explosion was followed by secondary ones, officials said.\nIn a separate social media post Monday evening, Allegheny County Emergency Services said the second fatality was a person who had previously been considered missing.\n\"Officials can confirm there has been a second fatality in connection with this incident,\" the agency said. \"This was the last of the two individuals that was initially unaccounted for.\"\nOne of two persons first reported missing was rescued, joining the list of those injured and taken to a local hospital, according to Victor Joseph, assistant superintendent of the county police. Dozens of others sustained injuries that didn't require hospitalization, a spokesperson said.\nU.S. Steel Executive Vice President Scott Buckiso told reporters at an afternoon news conference that the plant was stable except for the two structures shut down after the first explosion at 10:50 a.m. An investigation into the cause is underway.\nAllegheny County Emergency Services said the scene \"is now secure\" and that the agency, along with the county police department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, would remain on site.\nConstruction worker Zachary Buday, who was near the steel plant when the explosion happened, told WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh that it \"sounded like thunder.\"\n\"It shook my chest. It shook the building, then we saw the dark smoke rising from the steel mill,\" he said. \"Put two and two together. It's like something bad happened.\"\nThe station also reported that five of the 10 injured persons had been released from the hospital by 4 p.m. ET.\nThe moment of the initial blast, followed by large plumes of smoke shooting high into the air, is captured live in video from the BreatheProject, a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit that advocates for improvements to air quality in southwestern Pennsylvania.\nSearch for missing person amid intense heat\nAmbulances and other emergency vehicles circulated through the main gate of U.S. Steel Clairton Coke Works late Monday afternoon, several hours after the series of explosions.\nKasey Reigner, spokesperson for the Allegheny County Emergency Services, said there were initially dozens of \"walking wounded\" who were treated at the scene and sent home. She could not elaborate on the condition of those who were hospitalized, but pointed out the difficulty of searching for the missing person amid the destruction.\n\"It's really hot and that's a challenge,\" Reigner said. \"Our firefighters are trading people in, who can go in and put in the most effort in the heat, but this is a coordinated effort. We have pretty much dozens of agencies working together outside of Clairton, outside U.S. Steel, working to find the person that's left inside.\"\n'The whole house shook,' neighbor says\nAdrian Sparks lives in her family's brick home on a steep hill overlooking the coke plant. The morning explosion rocked her house and \"scared the living daylight out of me,\" she said.\n\"I heard a big boom and I jumped up,\" said Sparks, who was sitting on the side of her bed. \"I thought a vehicle hit my house. The whole house shook. My bed shook and I looked around. I didn't see anything. I turned my scanner on. They said there was an explosion in the mill. So me and my dog jumped in the car and I rode down by the ball field and that's when all the rescue workers were coming in, police and everything.\"\nAs a retired factory worker, Sparks said the fatality from the blast hit close to home. She worked in General Motors plants in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky before retiring and returning to Clairton in August. She remembers at least one other loud explosion at the plant several years ago.\n\"I just worry about the safety and the air quality,\" she said. \"These corporations, it's all about money. It's all corporate greed. They don't care about safety like they should.\"\nGov. Shapiro says 'multiple explosions' took place at plant\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said on social media the steel plant was the site of \"multiple explosions,'' and that his administration will provide whatever resources are required.\n\"Injured employees have now been transported to local hospitals to receive care, and search-and-rescue efforts remain active at the plant,'' Shapiro said. \"If you\u2019re in the area, continue to follow the instructions of local authorities.''\nU.S. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania said on social media he went to the plant Monday and spoke with officials, workers, and members of the community.\n\"Search and rescue still underway, air is safe but remain inside,\" he said. \"This is still an active scene.\"\nResidents near plant advised to stay indoors\nThe Allegheny County Department of Health issued a statement saying it was \"actively monitoring the explosion\" in coordination with first responders.\nResidents within one mile of the plant were being advised \"out of an abundance of caution\" to remain indoors, close windows and doors, and set their home cooling units to recirculation. Air quality monitors had not detected levels of toxins above federal standards, the department said.\nTwo workers at steel plant injured in February fire\nA fire at the plant on Feb. 5 injured two workers after a buildup of gases ignited, the Allegheny Front reported.\nThe Allegheny County Health Department said in a statement at the time that the incident was the result of a \u201chydraulic failure in a switch of the battery, which led to a buildup of combustible material,\u201d which then ignited.\nThe statement said a \"boom\" was heard and emissions leaked from the facility. The workers received first aid at the plant, were taken to a local hospital, and released, the Allegheny Front reported.\nThe Allegheny County Department of Health has a webpage that includes recent legal actions dating to 2018 against the plant, including penalties for emissions violations, leaks, and process and equipment failures.\nWhere is U.S. Steel Clairton Coke Works?\nClairton is about 20 miles south of Pittsburgh. The Clairton Plant is the largest coke manufacturing facility in the country and serves the commercial coke market as well as U.S. Steel's steelmaking facilities, according to U.S. Steel.\nThe longtime manufacturing icon, whose origins date back to the 19th century, was acquired in June by Nippon Steel, Japan's biggest steelmaker, in a $14.9 billion transaction.\nThe Clairton plant operates 10 coke oven batteries and annually produces more than 4 million tons of coke, a type of fuel used in the steelmaking process, per U.S. Steel.\nWhat is a coking plant?\nA coking plant turns coal into coke, which is in turn used to make steel in a blast furnace. The coal is softened, then liquified and re-solidified into coke. Coal in a coking plant is heated without oxygen to temperatures as high as 1,125 degrees Fahrenheit, removing its impurities. The resulting coke is a porous, carbon-heavy material.\nContributing: Reuters"

      "text": "Trump says he's looking at reclassifying marijuana at federal level\nIn 2024, DEA proposed a rule to transfer marijuana to Schedule III. That rule change has been on hold since March 2025.\nPresident Donald Trump said his administration is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\n\"We're looking at reclassification and we'll make a determination over the next few weeks,\" Trump said at news conference August 11.\nThough 45 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, the federal government still classifies it as a Schedule I drug.\nSchedule I drugs are defined as highly dangerous, addictive and without medical use. Marijuana has belonged to this class of drugs since the Controlled Substances Act was signed in 1970. If reclassified, marijuana would be treated the same as drugs like Tylenol with codeine and anabolic steroids, which can be prescribed by licensed health care providers and dispensed by licensed pharmacies.\nReclassifying marijuana would be the biggest change in marijuana policy the federal government has taken since the drug was first outlawed, but it would not make recreational usage legal under federal law.\nThe move began in 2022, when then-President Joe Biden asked the Department of Health and Human Services and the Drug Enforcement Administration to review how marijuana is scheduled. In 2023, Health and Human Services recommended that marijuana be moved to Schedule III. In 2024, DEA proposed a rule to transfer marijuana to Schedule III. That rule change has been on hold since March 2025.\nTrump said the decision is complicated, weighing the benefits of marijuana use for medical reasons against potential societal impacts.\n\"Some people like it, some people hate it. Some people hate the whole concept of marijuana,\" he said."
