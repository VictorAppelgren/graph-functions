  "title": "Eric Adams is right \u2014 we need involuntary treatment to solve the public drug scourge",
  "description": "Compelled treatment tries to correct behavior that drives drug users to hurt themselves and others. That\u2019s why 37 other states already permit it \u2014 and why New York should, too.",
  "content": "Can New York clean up its public drug-use problem?\n\nMayor Eric Adams aims to try: On Thursday, he called on the state Legislature to allow clinicians and judges to compel people into treatment when their drug use is hurting them and the city.\n\n\u201cWe must help those struggling finally get treatment, whether they recognize the need for it or not,\u201d Adams said at an event hosted by the Manhattan Institute (where I work).\n\n\u201cAddiction doesn\u2019t just harm individual users; it tears apart lives, families and entire communities, and we must change the system to keep all New Yorkers safer.\u201d\n\nAdams\u2019 proposed state law, the Compassionate Interventions Act, may face an uphill battle in Albany, as \u201charm reduction\u201d advocates assail it as coercive and dangerous.\n\nBut involuntary treatment should be a tool in New York\u2019s arsenal for dealing with the public drug use that has plagued it for years.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt the city has a problem.\n\nLast year it reported nearly 4,000 homeless residents with a history of chronic substance use \u2014 probably an undercount, as such people are less likely to be identified by the city\u2019s annual late-night census.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s not hard to find people shooting up on New York\u2019s streets \u2014 just visit the Hub in The Bronx or Washington Square Park in Manhattan.\n\nSuch behavior makes whole swaths of the city unlivable.\n\nPublic drug use hurts both users \u2014 there were more than 2,100 overdose deaths in the five boroughs last year \u2014 and the places where they use.\n\nIt deters commerce, and creates environments conducive to more serious crime.\n\nToo often the city has responded to these situations with benign neglect, exemplified by its two \u201csupervised consumption sites,\u201d which give people a place to use with Narcan-wielding staff standing by.\n\nThese sites continue to operate, in spite of the fact that they don\u2019t work and violate federal law.\n\nLeaving people free to abuse drugs, it turns out, doesn\u2019t save lives.\n\nInvoluntary treatment, by contrast, tries to correct the behavior that drives drug users to hurt both themselves and others.\n\nThat\u2019s why 37 other states already permit it \u2014 and why New York under Adams\u2019 plan would join them.\n\nCritics will insist that involuntary drug treatment doesn\u2019t work, and that people have to want to change.\n\nBut the balance of the evidence suggests that involuntary treatment performs as well as voluntary treatment.\n\nThat\u2019s backed up both by older research on California\u2019s involuntary-treatment scheme, and by strong indications that drug courts, which route drug offenders into treatment instead of prison, can reduce recidivism.\n\nOpponents will also say that it\u2019s immoral to compel people to get treatment they don\u2019t want, and that it violates their \u201cbodily autonomy.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s no right to shoot up in public spaces, or to ruin your body with fentanyl. And New Yorkers should have the right to expect their public spaces to be free from disorder, including public drug use.\n\nThe biggest challenge for Adams, though, may be the state\u2019s limited treatment capacity.\n\nNew York state as a whole has only 134 long-term residential treatment facilities.\n\nAs of 2023, the most recent available data, they were serving 2,935 clients \u2014 fewer than the city\u2019s tallied homeless drug-addict population.\n\nImplementing the Compassionate Interventions Act will almost certainly require more funding for treatment beds, much as Adams\u2019 previous efforts to institutionalize the seriously mentally ill did. That will have to be part of any ask in Albany.\n\nBut the mayor\u2019s proposal will also allow diversion to outpatient treatment programs, including a new $27 million investment in contingency management therapy \u2014 an evidence-based intervention that has been shown to help treat drug addiction.\n\nWhat happens if Albany says no to Adams\u2019 proposal? Or if Adams is out of the mayoralty come the next legislative session?\n\nThe NYPD can still work to clear encampments. And the city can still try to divert drug users into its drug-courts system, which, while useful, faces administrative problems and lacks transparency.\n\nBut actually getting drug users the help they need, rather than just cycling them through the city\u2019s jails, will be hard \u2014 much as the administration struggled to handle the seriously mentally ill before it had the power to compel them into treatment.\n\nThe success of Adams\u2019 initiative to assist the mentally ill homeless \u2014 over 3,500 people moved from the subways and streets to housing, according to the mayor\u2019s office \u2014 is a sign that such strategies can work elsewhere.\n\nExpanding the approach to public drug use is the next logical step. Albany should get on board.\n\nCharles Fain Lehman is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and senior editor of City Journal.",

  "summary": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams has proposed a state law allowing clinicians and judges to compel individuals into treatment for their drug use, which is harming both themselves and the city. The proposed Compassionate Interventions Act, which could face criticism from \"harm reduction\" advocates as coercive and dangerous, could also allow diversion to outpatient treatment programs. However, critics argue that involuntary drug treatment doesn't work and fails to correct the behavior that drives drug users to harm themselves and others. The state's limited treatment capacity may pose a challenge for Adams, as there are only 134 long-term residential treatment facilities in New York state.

      "text": "NYC Mayor Eric Adams does victory lap as new state rules make it easier to force mentally ill into treatment\nMayor Eric Adams lauded coming changes to state law that will make it easier to force mentally ill people into treatment \u2014 after he publicly pushed for the change for three years because of crime concerns.\nThe new involuntary commitment law, which is included in the state\u2019s budget, will allow officials to take people off the streets when they show a substantial risk of physical harm to themselves because of an \u201cinability or refusal, as a result of their mental illness, to provide for their own essential needs such as food, clothing, necessary medical care, personal safety, or shelter.\u201d\nBefore the switch, people could only be involuntarily committed if they showed a substantial risk to physically harm themselves or others.\n\u201cOur advocacy has led to real progress,\u201d Adams said during a victory-lap news conference at the Fulton Street subway station Thursday morning. \u201cWe will know in Albany, it takes some time, several sessions, till we get to the full product, and we will continue to move forward on it.\u201d\n\u201cOur clinicians have told us that the law was unclear on who they could transfer to hospitals for evaluation, which often resulted in quick discharge in times when people needed the help,\u201d Adams said at the event.\nAdams has used his bully pulpit to push for changes to involuntary commitment laws as far back as 2022, but hadn\u2019t been able to get the changes across the finish line in the last few sessions.\nBrian Stettin, a senior advisor to the mayor and author of the law that allows for court-mandated mental health treatment, Kendra\u2019s Law, insisted Adams and his administration brought progressives around to support new rules for involuntary commitments.\n\u201cBecause of the advocacy that Mayor Adams has done to bring some common sense into the conversation, even progressive-minded people have come to recognize that the mayor\u2019s position is the moral position,\u201d Stettin said.\n\u201cWe must take care of those who are the most vulnerable, even when they don\u2019t realize they need it,\u201d he added.\nStettin conceded that not all of the admin\u2019s proposals made it into the final language, but was happy with the progress.\nAdditionally, under the new law, someone could now be committed after sign-off from an examining physician and a nurse practitioner rather than the two physicians required by the previous law.\nThe practitioners would have three days after someone is brought to the hospital to decide whether he or she should be committed and reach out to the patient\u2019s doctor if they have one.\nThe final deal also included more requirements for psychiatric centers and local social services agencies to arrange discharge plans once someone is released from care.\nHizzoner appeared to start the festivities a bit earlier than most involved, after being spotted rubbing elbows with rapper Nems Wednesday night.\nThe Coney Island music maker posted an Instagram story showing himself and Adams at a hookah bar, blowing puffs of smoke into the air."

      "text": "New Yorkers are fed up with having to climb over drug-addled zombies and avoid mentally deranged vagrants on the streets and in the subways.\nBut the city\u2019s far-left politicians insist the homeless should be catered to on their own terms: We must care for them wherever they choose to sleep and even give them clean needles to support their addictions \u2014 the public\u2019s fears and disgust be damned.\nLast week President Donald Trump took the people\u2019s side.\nHis new executive order aims to pull federal funding from the \u201cfailed programs\u201d that facilitate the use of illegal drugs and permit the mentally ill to roam the streets and subways.\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority\u201d of the homeless, Trump stated, \u201care addicted to drugs or have mental health disorders or both. We want to take care of them. But they have to be off our streets.\u201d\nTrump wants civility.\nThe president can\u2019t force New York to follow his order, but his funding threat sets up a clash with city and state officials.\nIn 2024, federal cash \u2014 $7.2 billion in all, according to NYU\u2019s Furman Center \u2014 accounted for most of the money spent by the city\u2019s two housing agencies, and a significant share of the Department of Homeless Services\u2019 budget.\nUnder Trump\u2019s edict, federal funds will go only to housing programs that require addicts and the mentally ill to receive treatment \u2014 and can\u2019t be used to facilitate drug use.\nHe\u2019s boldly declaring that law-abiding people deserve safe neighborhoods and transit.\nTrump is discarding orthodoxies that the homelessness industrial complex and its political allies have insisted on for decades.\nLike \u201chousing first\u201d \u2014 the ubiquitous blue-state policy that offers the homeless permanent housing without making them enroll in addiction or mental-health treatment.\nBillions have been spent on \u201chousing first,\u201d and yet the number of homeless people is higher than ever.\nAnd like \u201charm reduction,\u201d another orthodoxy \u2014 providing clean needles, and even supervised injection sites, to make drug addiction slightly less deadly.\nGotham was the first city to open drug-use centers where addicts can shoot up under the supervision of medical personnel, who intervene in case of an overdose. The perfect addition to any neighborhood.\nVoters need to weigh in, making it clear they want a livable city, not sidewalks strewn with syringes and subway stations swarming with the mentally ill.\nStart with the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office, and the stark electoral choice between Republican Maud Maron and incumbent Democrat Alvin Bragg.\nOn a recent July day, Bragg could be seen painting watercolors in Washington Square Park, totally content with the reality his policies have allowed: The park has become a dangerous drug den, with addicts shooting up just a few feet away from his easel while social workers passed out free syringes for \u201charm reduction.\u201d\nMaron, Bragg\u2019s November challenger, calls out harm reduction for what it is \u2014\u201cOrwellian doublespeak.\u201d\n\u201cIt is harm amplification,\u201d she told me, \u201ctrapping addicts in their addiction and ruining public spaces for everyone else.\u201d\nEven before Trump\u2019s new executive order, Mayor Eric Adams had indicated his support for involuntarily hospitalizing violently mentally ill vagrants.\nBut in the upcoming mayoral election, leading challenger Zohran Mamdani is clearly on the side of the vagrants, not the public.\nHe insists the city should provide \u201coutreach\u201d and services to the unhoused wherever they choose to flop, including in the subways.\nMamdani wants to turn empty retail stores in subway stations into drop-in hubs for vagrants, a reckless proposal.\nCreating magnets that draw more homeless people into the subways would be a gut punch for New Yorkers who must ride the rails to get to work or school.\nMamdani has been pushing this proposal throughout his three terms in the state Assembly \u2014 elected each time with no Republican opponent in the general election to question him.\nOne-party rule greased the skids for Mamdani to rise to the mayoral race.\nAdams succeeded in getting Gov. Kathy Hochul to include in this year\u2019s state budget a change in the state\u2019s involuntary commitment law, expanding it to apply to those incapable of meeting their own basic needs, not just those who are deemed dangerous.\nThat\u2019s a step in the right direction \u2014 but Mamdani would take the city backward, ceding the streets to the crazies.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union bashed Trump\u2019s proposal to hospitalize the severely mentally ill, saying it \u201cdisplays remarkable disdain\u201d for \u201cvulnerable people.\u201d The National Alliance to End Homelessness condemned it as \u201cundignified.\u201d\nBut having to hug the subway wall for fear of getting pushed onto the tracks by a crazy person is undignified, too.\nCompassion for the homeless must be balanced with the safety and orderliness the rest of us deserve.\nBragg and Mamdani overlook that imperative. Voters be warned.\nBetsy McCaughey is a former lieutenant governor of New York and co-founder of the Committee to Save Our City."

To have the guy who\u2019s most responsible for the rampant drug use, mental illness and violence in the park come here to gaslight the entire neighborhood like it doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s infuriating.\u201d\nMoments before Bragg began painting a tree in watercolor, the city\u2019s drug crisis blossomed in real time a few feet away.\nPolice officers tried to revive a glassy-eyed junkie slumped on a bench \u2014 and workers from the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance were seen covertly slipping free syringes to addicts.\nThe needles are part of so-called \u201charm reduction kits\u201d the $13 million pro-drug non-profit touts online.\nThey come complete with drug paraphernalia that includes syringes, alcohol wipes, cotton, tourniquets and cookers, according to the group.\nIt\u2019s unclear how long the group \u2013 which was founded in 1994 with funding from far left-billionaire George Soros and lobbied for marijuana legalization \u2013 has been operating in the junkie-filled section of the park.\nSoros is the Drug Policy Alliance\u2019s chief donor and previous chairman. His son Alex Soros still sits on its board.\nThe organization, which said its philosophy is about \u201cmeeting people where they are,\u201d declined to comment.\nHarm reduction enables addicts to shoot up rather than getting them to quit, critics have charged.\n\u201cThe idea is that people should only seek treatment when they\u2019re ready. But most people addicted to drugs are addicted for their whole lives,\u201d Charles Fane Lehmann, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, recently told The Post.\n\u201cThey often regard efforts to get people into treatment . . . as actively hostile to the interests of people who use drugs.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the NYPD\u2019s Sixth Precinct continues to arrest the park\u2019s regular half a dozen dealers \u2014 most of whom are released shortly after.\n\u201cNo one should feel comfortable selling drugs in the West Village, especially Washington Square Park,\u201d cops posted this week after another bust.\nA record 471 narcotics arrests have been made in the precinct alone so far this year, up 68% from a year ago, according to NYPD data."

      "text": "Mayor Eric Adams unveils new campaign office in Brooklyn as he ramps up re-election bid\nMayor Eric Adams cut the ribbon on his new Brooklyn campaign office Thursday as he ramps up his re-election bid in a crowded general race.\nDozens of enthusiastic supporters gathered outside the modest, Old Mill Basin office \u2014 situated between a smoke shop and a Chinese restaurant \u2014 which was plastered with signs that read \u201cRe-Elect Eric for Mayor\u201d to celebrate the opening.\n\u201cWhy Brooklyn?\u201d Adams asked the crowd on Avenue T, near East 58th Street, \u201cBecause Brooklyn is the place I was born \u2026 it was the place that shaped and made me.\u201d\nFormer aides, municipal union reps, and even the mayor\u2019s brother, Bernard Adams, were among those in attendance at what the campaign said would be the first of several offices it will open across the five boroughs.\nIt was the second notable event for Hizzoner\u2019s re-election bid this week.\nOn Tuesday, Adams \u2014 who is running in the November race as an independent after opting not to vie for the Democratic nomination \u2014 got a boost from scores of city faith leaders at an endorsement event in front of City Hall, where one pastor took shots at frontrunner Zohran Mamdani.\nBut Adams was also dealt a blow Wednesday when the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board \u2014 which matches candidates\u2019 fundraising 8-1 with public dollars \u2014 again denied him access to the funds.\nAdams and the CFB have been locked in a standoff since December as the regulatory board has repeatedly barred him from the program, citing suspicions of the mayor\u2019s 2021 campaign violating the law and an alleged refusal by the current team to provide information requested as part of its probe.\nA recent poll showed Adams grabbing a mere 7% of votes in the upcoming election, losing a substantial amount of support to fellow independent candidate ex-Gov.

We were 13 points behind Andrew Yang, and they counted us out,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey thought that we couldn\u2019t win. But I knew something that no one else knew.

      "text": "Bronx\u2019s \u2018The Hub\u2019 is drug-riddled business as usual after Post exposes junkie wasteland\nSome habits are hard to break.\n\u201cThe Hub\u201d in the Bronx was drug-riddled business as usual a day after a Post expos\u00e9 on the armies of junkies and depravity consuming the commercial corridor.\nAddicts openly mixed and shot up opioids into their arms and necks, sometimes spilling blood onto the sidewalk, in broad daylight when The Post returned to the area Monday. One may have even overdosed outside a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.\nMany junkies were passed out on benches in Roberto Clemente Plaza, where the dealers brazenly peddled their wares \u2014 with seeming impunity and without any increased NYPD presence.\nThe Post\u2019s reporting prompted the Rev. Ruben Diaz Sr., a former Bronx councilman and state senator, to plead for President-elect Donald Trump to step in and fix The Hub.\n\u201cThe shocking show that just won\u2019t end,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI am calling on @realDonaldTrump to please come back to the boogie down Bronx and help our senior citizens and residents In (sic) general enjoy our recreational areas.\u201d\nThe desperate plea to the tough-on-crime incoming president comes as there have been years of sustained \u2014 but unsuccessful \u2014 efforts to eradicate the drug-ridden problems that plague the \u201cBroadway of the Bronx.\u201d\n\u2018A dumping ground\u2019\nThe latest stab at cleaning up The Hub unfolded during October and November, when the multi-agency \u201cCommunity Link Operation\u201d saw NYPD officers and sanitation and health department workers address quality of life issues.\nThe effort led to 35 arrests, 150 moving violations and 25 criminal summonses, police said.\nDepartment of Homeless Services staffers also saw 366 \u201cactive substance users,\u201d 28 drug deals and put 47 people in shelter, City Hall officials said.\nBut seemingly nothing had changed by when The Post spent days in The Hub in late November and early December.\n\u201cIt just, in my opinion, just got worse,\u201d said Councilman Rafael Salamanca (D-Bronx), who represents The Hub.\nSalamanca detailed years of frustrations, from former Mayor Bill de Blasio allegedly dropping the ball on a $8 million anti-overdose effort to the NYPD failing to crack down on dealers.\nHe\u2019s supportive of their efforts but is concerned that the commercial center is over-saturated with social programs \u2014 ultimately ensuring that the area remains a haven for drug users.\n\u201cYou have close to two dozen not-for-profits, giving out needles, providing substance abuse programming, giving out methadone, methadone clinics and you have an issue with homelessness in that immediate area, with homeless shelters, it\u2019s a recipe for disaster,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cWhen you over-populate a specific area with a substance abuse issue at that magnitude, you\u2019re never going to get the results you want and that area is going to remain like that forever, until you start moving some of those programs out.\u201d\nPedro Suarez, executive director of the Third Avenue Business Improvement District, also wonders if the substance abuse clinics could be more spread out, although \u2013 like Salamanca \u2013 he broadly supports their work.\nHe said the larger issue is that addicts are being squeezed out of many other New York City neighborhoods, and few neighborhoods have the appetite to host services for them.\n\u201cIt almost feels like the South Bronx becomes a dumping ground,\u201d he said, before insisting he \u201cwouldn\u2019t directly blame\u201d the substance abuse service providers.\nVolunteers at St. Ann\u2019s Corner of Harm Reduction routinely hand out syringes, bandages and event drug paraphernalia, such as distilled water, bottle caps and cotton wool in their efforts to protect addicts from overdosing, HIV infections and other side effects of their dangerous habit.\nHowever, Steven Hernandez, the group\u2019s chief of staff, said outreach services follow the addicts, not the other way around.\nHe said The Hub has drawn junkies since the 1960s.\n\u201cThe Hub is where everything happens,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cIt\u2019s where people go to buy their groceries, go to their medical appointments and go to the bank. And it\u2019s also where people buy their drugs. It\u2019s been like that forever.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always this chicken and the egg conversation around trying to blame outreach workers or harm reduction programs because \u2018you guys are there offering services, that\u2019s why the drug dealers are there.\u2019 No, we are there because the drug dealers were already there,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cOur goal is that our services are not needed and that we have to shut down.\u201d\nAdditionally, The Hub may have many drug outreach services, but it lacks any brick-and-mortar substance abuse counseling services \u2014 forcing addicts to use on the street, Hernandez said.\nMany locals, meanwhile, complained that the NYPD isn\u2019t doing enough to crack down on dealers.\nThose concerns were amplified by Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-Bronx), who in September sent Mayor Eric Adams a letter pleading for the city to crack down on the \u201copen-air drug market.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I went to see the drug hotspot for myself, I found myself in a state of shock not only at the severity of the situation but also at the lack of anything resembling a robust police presence,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was a scene of lawlessness and disorder.\u201d\nTorres\u2019 visit and letter yielded results, but only temporarily, said Siraj Bhaiyat, the owner of local variety store Willis Discount at Roberto Clemente Plaza.\n\u201cWhen Ritchie Torres came here around two months ago, the police came two or three times a day and there was less drug use,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce Torres had been and gone, everything went back to normal.\u201d\nA designated group of NYPD cops patrol The Hub seven days a week, both on foot and in vehicles, a police spokesperson said.\nCops conducted nearly 1,200 narcotics arrests in the 40th Precinct covering The Hub as of December, up 20% percent from the same point last year, police said.\n\u2018The police don\u2019t care\u2019\nOn a cold Monday, South Bronx resident Nyleen, 23, walked through the open-air drug market \u2014 a monument of poisonous persistence and the New York City government\u2019s helplessness.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so normal to see people shooting up on the sidewalk around here, the police don\u2019t even care,\u201d Nyleen said. \u201cIt is normal in the South Bronx to see police walk past drug deals and drug addicts using.\n\u201cWe have a new police precinct right over there,\u201d she said, pointing to the NYPD\u2019s new 40th Precinct building on the same block, \u201cand they don\u2019t care.\u201d\nThe Post spotted no sign of any additional police presence and every indication of entrenched drug depravity.\nOn Brook Avenue across from the Horizon Juvenile Center, where the Post previously watched a man overdose and be revived with naloxone, addicts openly mixed and shot up opioids.\nFive addicts sat on the sidewalk, where they had laid out grocery catalogs to mix their shots of heroin or fentanyl, applying distilled water and the drugs together into bottle caps. They drew doses into syringes through cotton wool.\nOne addict, who applied a tourniquet to his bicep before injecting, made a mess of his vein and drew a steady flow of blood that spilled on the sidewalk.\nAnother crawled on all fours with a long string of snot suspended from his nose before collapsing next to another addict preparing yet more shots.\nJust around the corner at the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts on East 149th Street, a man with mismatched shoes frothed at the mouth and collapsed unconscious before FDNY EMTs carted him away.\nThe Post could not determine if the man had overdosed or suffered an unrelated seizure, but Dunkin\u2019 workers said addicts are often in the store.\n\u201cHe was foaming at the mouth, then he was drooling, then he was shaking, then he dropped,\u201d a Dunkin\u2019 worker said.\n\u201cMaybe it was drugs, maybe he took too much.\u201d\nBhaiyat, the variety store owner, said he believes police forcing the dealers out is the answer.\n\u201cIf you get rid of the dealers, the addicts will leave too,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe addicts are here because this is where the dealers are. The charities are here because this is where the addicts are. The addicts come here to buy drugs, not for the charities.\u201d"

      "text": "Vape shops are popping up in every neighborhood in America, but few people \u2014 even doctors \u2014 know that many of these shops are selling a dangerous new opioid.\nIt\u2019s concentrated 7-OH, a synthetic byproduct of the kratom plant that binds strongly to the body\u2019s opioid receptors \u2014 making it up to 13 times more potent than morphine.\nThis addictive compound is ubiquitous, it\u2019s being pushed deceptively to consumers, and its use is quietly growing.\nIn previous waves of the opioid crisis \u2014 prescription opioids, heroin and fentanyl \u2014 the Food and Drug Administration realized too late that a public health crisis was raging, and got caught flat-footed.\nLet\u2019s not make that mistake again.\nOn Tuesday, in collaboration with the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FDA began the process of reviewing whether products with unusually high levels of 7-OH should be classified as controlled substances.\nTo be clear, the kratom plant leaf, which contains trace amounts of 7-OH and has been consumed for centuries, is not our focus at the FDA.\nRather, we are seeking to remove a dangerous synthetic opioid from retail shelves nationwide.\nAs a part of this effort, the FDA issued seven warning letters earlier this month to prominent firms illegally marketing 7-OH products. Already a number of companies have stopped sales, another is recalling its products, and one company\u2019s website disappeared entirely.\nBut a DEA classification and warning letters alone won\u2019t solve this problem. We must also educate the public to be vigilant about this threat.\nAmericans should know that synthetic, concentrated 7-OH products can be marketed as 7-hydroxymitragynine, 7-OH-mitragynine, 7-OHMG, 7-Hydroxy, 7-HMG or 7 \u2014 and all these compounds pose significant health risks.\nThe potency of 7-OH greatly increases the risk of overdose and dependence. A 2025 National Institute on Drug Abuse study found that 7-OH resulted in respiratory depression at a magnitude three times more severe than morphine.\nGiven how 7-OH interacts with the brain, we\u2019re hearing more and more stories of severe addiction in young people \u2014 and of major withdrawal symptoms, including insomnia, anxiety, body aches and sweats.\nWe don\u2019t have precise statistics about the use of 7-OH. Because it\u2019s unregulated, sales data and adverse-event reporting are close to nonexistent.\nBut instead of waiting for a crisis before we respond, we\u2019re reading the signs and acting proactively.\nDespite the critical differences between natural leaf kratom and synthetic 7-OH, many of these opioid products are marketed as \u201ckratom extract\u201d or \u201cenhanced kratom\u201d and sold on the same shelves as kratom.\nMany 7-OH products do not even state how much of the substance the product contains.\nAnd since the vast majority of these products come from uninspected manufacturing facilities in India, users may consume inconsistent doses and unknown contaminants.\nPerhaps most alarming is that 7-OH products are often disguised as attractive candies, gummies and even ice cream cones that parents might never see as a risk.\nBut let\u2019s be clear: No FDA-approved drug, food or supplement product contains 7-OH, and none of the health claims made about these products have been federally substantiated.\nPublic safety is a priority for President Trump and his administration. To support the FDA\u2019s broader actions on 7-OH, the National Institutes of Health will be initiating studies to better understand the substance\u2019s effects.\nWhile some 7-OH products claim to provide pain relief, clinicians and people struggling with addiction should not view this synthetic opioid as a safer alternative \u2014 and store owners, too, should be aware that 7-OH is not just another harmless product.\nA special FDA resource page, \u201cHiding in Plain Sight,\u201d provides more about the risks of 7-OH and how to avoid them.\nHistorically, the medical establishment has been slow to understand and respond to new products as they come to market.\nFrom cigarettes to social media, it often takes decades before we recognize pervasive harms.\nBut as with tobacco, we know that public awareness can drive behavior change \u2014 and massive public health improvements can follow.\nEven better than rolling back a public health crisis would be never having one in the first place. Let\u2019s not allow 7-OH to drive the next wave of the US opioid epidemic.\nDr. Marty Makary is the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration."

      "text": "Rep. Ritchie Torres blasts NYC for failing to clean up \u2018Broadway of the Bronx\u2019 as report finds it\u2019s overrun with junkies\nUS Rep. Ritchie Torres blasted city authorities for failing to clean up the \u201cBroadway of the Bronx,\u201d which has descended into a notorious open-air drug market full of junkies and prostitutes.\n\u201cThe City of New York has fundamentally failed to deliver a durable solution to a crisis that continues to spiral out of control,\u201d Torres said in a report released Wednesday on the South Bronx \u201cHub\u201d commercial district.\n\u201cThe City\u2019s response has amounted to little more than a game of whack-a-mole \u2014 briefly suppressing illicit activity, only for the drug market to re-emerge with greater intensity,\u201d said Torres, a Democrat whose district includes the area.\nRoberto Clemente Plaza and other streets are \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by drug use and sex workers in broad daylight, Torres claimed \u2014 which is driving away foot traffic and creating an atmosphere of \u201clawlessness and disorder.\u201d\nThe Hub \u2014 overseen by the Third Avenue Business Improvement District \u2014 is the central commercial corridor between Melrose and Mott avenues that includes Roberto Clemente Plaza and encompasses more than 300 storefronts and 50 commercial properties.\nIt draws over 3.3 million annual visitors.\nThe Post reported last December that the Hub had become a drug-ridden wasteland taken over by zonked-out junkies.\n\u201cWith a commercial vacancy rate of 15%, the Third Avenue BID cannot afford to stand by passively as an unfettered open-air drug market decimates foot traffic and paralyzes local business activity,\u201d Torres said in a letter sent to Mayor Eric Adams.\nThe congressman\u2019s report found that:\n- Roberto Clemente Plaza has become a de facto waiting room for addicts enrolled at Samaritan Daytop Village, a nearby drug abuse treatment provider.\n- Emergency responders are dispatched to the plaza multiple times per day, with as many as 20 overdoses reported in a single week.\n- The plaza\u2019s design \u2014 particularly its permanent seating \u2014 has turned it into a magnet for loitering, drug trafficking, and opioid overdoses.\n- The surrounding sidewalks and streets are littered with syringes. Those distributing them must assume responsibility for cleanup rather than allowing them to accumulate as a public health hazard, Torres said.\n- Repeat drug offenders with multiple open criminal cases continue to roam the streets with impunity, \u201cfurther eroding community confidence in the rule of law.\u201d\n\u201cThe plaza needs a complete reset \u2026 it needs to be temporarily shuttered, and we need to\nredesign and remove the seating \u2026 because that seating is only allowing people to sit, overdose, and just wait for an ambulance to come and get them,\u201d said Pedro Suarez, executive director of the Third Avenue BID.\n\u201cThe drug dealers don\u2019t even have to try hard. It\u2019s a captive audience. Even if there are folks trying to get over their addiction, they\u2019re being re-exposed to the trauma again and again,\u201d added Suarez.\nTorres appealed to the mayor to intervene with a consistent, prolonged, multi-agency campaign to revitalize the Hub.\n\u201cDespite repeated announcements of multi-agency operations \u2014 often launched with great fanfare \u2014 the City of New York is no closer to solving the public health and safety crisis that has taken hold of the Hub. The mission is far from accomplished. If anything, conditions on the ground have gotten worse,\u201d Torres told the mayor.\n\u201cThe City of New York must demonstrate a renewed whole-of-government commitment to reclaiming the Hub from the grip of drug trafficking and return it where it rightfully belongs: to the people of the Bronx.\u201d\nThe mayor\u2019s office insisted City Hall is on the case.\n\u201cThe Adams administration agrees that the decades-long issues plaguing \u2018The Hub\u2019 in the Bronx are unacceptable, which is why we brought our \u2018Community Link\u2019 model to the neighborhood \u2014 a multi-agency operation of surged resources to address substance abuse, mental health, homeless outreach, sanitation, and other quality-of-life issues that prevent this part of the South Bronx from reaching its full potential,\u201d an Adams spokesperson said.\n\u201cWe have responded to thousands of complaints, issued more than 3,600 summonses, placed dozens of homeless individuals in shelter, removed more than 730 syringes from our streets, made more than 1,000 arrests, and much more. But let\u2019s be clear: this work is not done \u2014 our priority is to ensure safety. Progress is measured, but feeling safe is what truly matters. We will continue working until every individual feels safe and secure.\u201d\nTorres previously criticized Gov. Kathy Hochul for not stepping in to bust up the drug haven.\nThe concerns stretch back years. Merchants and local business leaders in 2021 sent a letter to then-Mayor Bill de Blasio, pleading for action on the drug-dealing, homelessness and crime consuming the Hub.\nTorres announced last week that he\u2019s likely not running for governor and will seek re-election to his 15th District House seat next year."

      "text": "Mayor Adams announces over 1,000 homeless New Yorkers moved from subways to permanent homes thanks to Subway Safety Plan\nOver 3,500 homeless New Yorkers have been taken off Big Apple streets and subways and placed in permanent housing since the start of Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 term, Hizzoner announced on Monday \u2014 touting it as proof that his \u201cSubway Safety Plan\u201d is working.\nOver 1,000 of the housing placements came directly from the subway system since the plan launched in early 2022 as part of a broader effort to curb the ongoing homelessness crisis in transit stations, officials said.\n\u201cMore work remains, but it\u2019s clear that the years of walking by New Yorkers in need are over, and this milestone is further proof that we\u2019re continuing to make New York City a safer, more affordable city,\u201d Adams said in a statement.\nCity Hall officials couldn\u2019t say how many people outreach workers had encountered on the streets and subway since 2022, only that 3,500 had been connected to permanent housing.\nThe last street homelessness count was 4,500 on January 28, an Adams spokesperson said, adding that some 85,500 people are currently being housed in city homeless shelters.\nAdams highlighted the number of people connected to permanent housing as part of his new \u201cEnd Anything Goes\u201d campaign \u2014 a push to show how his administration is cracking down on public disorder while expanding services for New Yorkers with mental illness and addiction.\nThe campaign will highlight the current efforts the administration has made to date to \u201cchange the culture\u201d and laws that have prevented mentally ill New Yorkers from seeking help \u2014 while also making investments to support outreach, harm reduction, and housing, Adams said.\n\u201cThis success would not be possible without our historic investments,\u201d the mayor said, crediting Safe Haven beds, outreach teams, and a \u201crecord-breaking creation of affordable housing.\u201d\nSince launching the multi-agency Subway Safety Plan, the city has connected 8,600 people to types of shelter, with over 1,000 now in permanent homes. The effort focuses on outreach at stations to pull people with serious mental health issues out of the transit system.\nThe MTA said this July had the lowest transit-crime stats since 1995 when the data were first collected, with an 8% drop in felonies in the subways last month \u2014 even as a string of violent crimes in the subway system recently left a straphanger slashed and another shoved onto the tracks by a muttering maniac.\nHizzoner also touted the city\u2019s growing network of shelter beds, with 400 more Safe Haven beds to house the homeless and transition them to permanent housing to be added by the end of 2025.\nSo far, 1,400 new beds have been added since Adams took office, City Hall said.\nAdams introduced a $650 million plan to tackle homelessness and get mentally ill New Yorkers off the streets and out of subways during his State of the City speech in January \u2014 begging Albany for more help tackling the Big Apple\u2019s ongoing crisis.\nThe ambitious, five-year proposal \u2014 which is set to include a special new facility to house and treat mentally ill New Yorkers \u2014 follows a spate of frightening underground attacks that have plagued the transit system of late.\nAs part of the plan, a $13 million \u201cpilot program,\u201d as described by a City Hall rep, would create a 100-bed supportive housing facility that would provide shelter to people leaving psychiatric facilities who are not yet ready to fully live alone without support to continue their meds and treatment, officials said.\nThe initiative would also add 900 \u201cSafe Haven\u201d beds, which will be spread across the city, to house the homeless and transition them to permanent housing \u2014 bringing the total to 4,900. An additional 100 beds will also be added to serve runaway and homeless youth ages 21 to 24.\nAnd a new \u201cBridge to Home\u201d model under the proposal will offer home-like environments to patients with serious mental illnesses at NYC Health + Hospitals.\nThe program will target patients who are ready to be discharged from hospitals but have nowhere to go home to, officials said."

      "text": "Eric Adams advances fight against NYC public drug use with new law allowing doctors to involuntarily commit addicts\nMayor Eric Adams wants to make it easier to take drug addicts off the streets \u2014 and into treatment against their will.\nAdams unveiled the \u201cCompassionate Interventions Act,\u201d a proposed state law that would expand involuntary commitment for people suffering from substance abuse disorders, on Wednesday during an address at the New York Hilton Midtown.\n\u201cToday I\u2019m putting forward our proposal for those who have been considered a lost cause,\u201d Adams declared.\nThe change would help New York City fight public drug use, officials first revealed to The Post \u2014 a scourge in places such as the Hub in the Bronx, where addicts openly inject heroin and other narcotics.\nThe bill \u2014 which the Adams administration said would be introduced in the 2026 state legislative session \u2014 would put New York in line with 37 other states that allow drug addicts to be involuntarily committed, according to the officials.\nAn Albany sponsor for the legislation has yet to be identified, however.\nAdams argued that the state legislature needs to ignore extreme voices to get the bill done.\n\u201cWhat you are finding is our state houses and our city council have been hijacked by the numerical minority,\u201d he said.\nThe proposed law would be a sequel of sorts to the Supportive Interventions Act, a new involuntary commitment law that Adams had successfully pushed for during the last legislative session.\nBefore the change, people could only be committed against their will if they showed a substantial risk to physically harm themselves or others.\nThe law now allows officials to take mentally ill people off the streets if they\u2019re so sick that they cannot feed, clothe or otherwise take care of their essential needs.\nGov. Kathy Hochul seemed unaware of Adams announcing his new involuntary commitment idea and said she would review the details. She touted the first involuntary commitment legislation she pushed through Albany during the state budget earlier this year.\n\u201cI feel proud of what we did in that case, I just don\u2019t know the details of what the mayor is proposing,\u201d Hochul told reporters after an unrelated event in Schenectady Thursday afternoon.\nOfficials with the governor\u2019s office said the involuntary commitment law passed this year likely would cover mentally ill people who also suffer from substance abuse disorders.\nCity Hall officials confirmed that they didn\u2019t reach out to the governor\u2019s office, but rather will pursue the legislation on their own.\nThey argued the recent changes don\u2019t go far enough and fail to account for people who are just high on streets or subways without showing signs of being in mental crisis.\nAdams this week launched his \u201cEnd Anything Goes\u201d campaign, an election-year push to show how his administration is cracking down on public disorder, while expanding services for New Yorkers with mental illness and addiction.\nThe Compassionate Interventions Act would allow medical professionals to transport people who appear to be struggling with addiction, as well as allow judges to mandate treatment if they refuse voluntary care.\nThe mayor\u2019s plan will also invest $27 million focused on improving access to drug treatment, boost funding for syringe service programs by $14 million and create a new drop-in space at the Hub, officials said.\nAdvocates with The Legal Aid Society panned Adams\u2019 proposal, arguing it raises civil rights concerns and fails to address the root causes of substance use.\n\u201cMoreover, the Mayor\u2019s attempt to frame this as a \u2018quality of life\u2019 measure is revealing \u2014 treating people in crisis as a nuisance to be swept out of public view rather than as human beings deserving care and dignity,\u201d the advocates said in a statement.\n\u201cExpanding involuntary commitment laws will not solve the drug war or end the overdose crisis; it will only deepen mistrust, waste resources, and cause lasting harm to the very people the City claims to want to help.\u201d"

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.

By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications.

      "text": "Trump targets New York drug \u2018injection sites\u2019 where addicts consume with the city\u2019s blessing\nTwo city-approved \u201csafe\u201d drug injection sites could be forced to close under a new executive order issued by President Trump, which rips the facilities, where addicts can use illegal drugs like meth, heroin and cocaine under supervision.\nTrump\u2019s July 24 \u201cEnding Crime and Disorder on America\u2019s Streets\u201d order says the feds should only fund \u201cevidence-based programs\u201d and not fund \u201cso-called harm reduction or safe consumption efforts,\u201d which he says \u201conly facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm.\u201d\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-Staten Island) hailed Trump\u2019s edict.\n\u201cI urge the Department of Justice to take immediate action and shut down these centers and put to an end once and for all their operations,\u201d Malliotakis said.\nBack in January 2021, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia previously ruled \u201cit is a federal crime to open a supervised injection site or \u2018consumption room\u2019 for illegal drug use,\u201d overruling the District Court for the Eastern District decision.\nEarlier this year, Malliotakis reintroduced her legislation \u2014 the Defund Heroin Injection Centers Act of 2025 \u2014 which would put into law Trump\u2019s executive order and permanently block federal funding for injection sites or \u201cillicit operations.\u201d\nIn February, she urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to close the two city injection sites operated by OnPointNYC. The two injection sites in the city are in East Harlem and Washington Heights.\nThe injection sites were launched in November 2021 by then-Mayor Bill de Blasio and the city Health Department under former President Joe Biden \u2014 and continued under Mayor Eric Adams..\nIn 2023, then-Manhattan US attorney Damian Williams, warned Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration that the two sites were illegal \u2014 but no action was taken to shutter the facilities\nThe city Health Department defended the injection sites Tuesday as a life saver.\n\u201cSyringe service programs play an invaluable role in New York City\u2019s successful efforts to prevent and reduce overdose deaths and have been proven effective \u2014 evident by the fact that the city saw the lowest number of overdose deaths in four years at the end of last year,\u201d a Health Department spokesperson said.\n\u201cSince the 1980s, syringe service programs have reduced the spread of HIV and Hepatitis C and prevented countless deaths, while providing on-ramps to broader care. We all want a healthier and safer city but closing the doors to these programs will only further isolate the New Yorkers who rely on these services.\u201d\nMayor Adams also previously expressed support for opening more locations.\nOnPointNYC also has defended the program as a life saver by intervening in overdoses of users.\nBut Malliotakis said government-sanctioned injection sites are destructive \u2014 to individuals and the surrounding community.\n\u201cSince 2021, New York City has allowed two illegal drug injection sites to remain open, and it\u2019s time to shut down these illegal facilities to protect public safety and the quality of life for all New Yorkers,\u201d Malliotakis said.\n\u201cI thank President Trump for his executive order addressing homelessness and to end federal funding for all heroin injection sites \u2014 the very action my legislation would make permanent.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s executive order also expands civil commitment procedures for individuals on the streets or in the subway with serious mental illness who pose risks to themselves or others.\nIt also prioritizes federal grants for jurisdictions that enforce prohibitions on open drug use and ends support for \u201chousing first\u201d policies that fail to promote treatment and recovery."

      "text": "New York\u2019s two supervised drug-consumption sites have long suffered from the soft bigotry of low expectations.\nProponents say the sites are vital, life-saving tools in the ever-expanding drug crisis.\nMayor Adams declared, \u201cOverdose prevention centers keep neighborhoods and people struggling with substance use safe.\u201d\nBut the evidence Adams and others use to support this argument almost always supports less than they claim.\nTake a recent Journal of the American Medical Association paper that measures the effect of New York\u2019s two supervised-consumption sites \u2014 also known as safe-injection sites \u2014 on crime and disorder in their vicinity.\nCompared with \u201ccontrol\u201d areas, the study finds, the sites did not cause a statistically significant increase in either outcome.\nThe study is well-designed, a rarity for research on these sites. So its conclusion is certainly plausible.\nBut there\u2019s an important limitation.\nThe comparison areas aren\u2019t random city blocks but the areas around New York\u2019s 17 needle exchanges.\nThat means supervised-consumption sites don\u2019t increase disorder any more than other drug services do.\nThat\u2019s an interesting finding. But knowing that supervised-consumption sites don\u2019t make crime worse in service-saturated neighborhoods only tells us so much.\nIt does not inform us what would happen if, for example, such a site were set up in midtown Manhattan.\nEven more important than this limitation is another implication of the study, one that harm-reduction advocates would like to ignore.\nIts results imply supervised-consumption sites may not increase crime, but they don\u2019t reduce it, either.\nAdvocates sometimes pitch supervised sites as a way to reduce visible public drug use by bringing it indoors.\nState Sen. Gustavo Rivera, for example, claims that \u201cpublic drug use, syringe litter and drug-related crime goes down\u201d where such sites are used.\nBut in New York, that\u2019s not happening.\nRather, the \u201cnull\u201d finding of the JAMA study is just the latest example of an important trend: Wherever they\u2019re tried, supervised-consumption sites don\u2019t make things worse, but they also don\u2019t make things better.\nThe sites\u2019 proponents like to say their support is \u201cevidence-based.\u201d\nBut the overwhelming conclusion of the scientific evidence is that they have no effect on overdose-death rates in their vicinity.\nTwo studies of Vancouver, Canada, and Catalonia, Spain, found that those who used such sites more were no less likely to OD than those who used them less.\nAn evaluation of the New South Wales, Australia, site found no statistically significant difference in overdoses near the site, compared with the rest of the state.\nMost persuasive, two recent studies of 34 sites across British Columbia and Ontario using high-quality statistical methods find no effect on OD-death rates.\nConsumption sites were sold to New Yorkers as a means to stem the overdose-death crisis.\nBut death rates continue to rise in the neighborhoods near New York\u2019s facilities.\nThey also don\u2019t seem to be getting people into treatment.\nData from New York\u2019s sites show that only a small fraction of clients are getting referred for medication or counseling services.\nIt\u2019s not enough that supervised-consumption sites don\u2019t make things worse \u2014 they need to make them better, too.\nAfter all, sites like New York\u2019s eat up valuable private funds that could be directed toward drug-treatment and -prevention services.\nIf site director Sam Rivera had his way, they\u2019d also be getting a cut of the state\u2019s opioid-settlement funds.\nIf supervised-consumption sites want public funds for running a federally illegal service, they need to actually save the lives they claim to save.\nThat they don\u2019t is a good reason for New York to retool the approach \u2014 or scrap them altogether.\nCharles Fain Lehman is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a contributing editor of City Journal and a 2023-24 Robert Novak fellow with the Fund for American Studies."

  "argos_summary": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams is advocating for the Compassionate Interventions Act, which would allow for the involuntary treatment of drug addicts, aiming to address the city's public drug use crisis. This proposal faces opposition from harm reduction advocates who view it as coercive, despite evidence suggesting that involuntary treatment can be effective. The city is grappling with significant drug-related issues, including high overdose rates and visible public drug use, particularly in areas like the Bronx's Hub. Critics argue that existing harm reduction strategies, such as supervised consumption sites, have not effectively reduced drug use or overdose deaths.",
