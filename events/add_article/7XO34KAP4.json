      "summary": "The Cincinnati police union criticized the arrest of Alex Tchervinski, a 45-year-old White man charged with disorderly conduct after being a victim in a violent brawl that left several injured. Tchervinski's attorney claims he was assaulted while trying to protect his girlfriend and friends, and argues that the charges against him are unjust. The incident, which occurred on July 26, has sparked significant community backlash and raised concerns about racial dynamics, as the initial suspects arrested were all Black, leading to accusations of political pressure on law enforcement.",
