      "title": "Chuck Todd says Biden's presidency was so 'weak and ineffective' it made people go back to Trump",
      "summary": "Former NBC host Chuck Todd accused President Biden of sabotaging the Democratic Party by staying in the 2024 race, claiming Biden’s inner circle deliberately scheduled a disastrous debate to expose his cognitive decline and force a withdrawal. Todd argues that Biden’s portrayal as a devoted family man was a myth and that the party’s failure to act earlier allowed Donald Trump to regain the presidency, making Biden’s legacy a ‘40‑year bill of goods.’ He further contends that Biden’s withdrawal and endorsement of Kamala Harris damaged the party’s credibility, while highlighting Trump’s historic comeback as a rare political reversal. The piece also recounts Biden’s 2024 exit, the ensuing Democratic turmoil, and Trump’s re‑election, framing the debate as a pivotal moment in American politics.",
