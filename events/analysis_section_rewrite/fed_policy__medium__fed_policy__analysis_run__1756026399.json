      "feedback": "This draft does a solid job tying ACMR’s fundamentals to a macro narrative, but to reach world-class quality it needs a formal 3–6 month scenario map with explicit catalysts, triggers, and invalidations, plus tighter execution of first-principles logic and numbers. Actionable edits: 1) restructure into a base case plus 1–2 clearly delineated alt scenarios (3–6 months) with timing windows and path dependence (e.g., Fed easing timeline from C22MKA9VY—first 50bp cut in Sep, total 150–175bp; IPO cycle uptick from 95 deals raising $12.9b in 2025; Russell 2000 cheap vs S&P and potential regime shift from Q7VVGNSQE). Tie each scenario to both macro channels (rates, inflation, risk appetite) and micro channels (ACMR’s earnings progression, product cycle, margins, and capex exposure). 2) Add explicit invalidation signals: e.g., a delay or reversal of rate cuts, hotter-than-expected inflation, or ACMR guiding below the 850–950m 2025 revenue band; or a surge in U.S.–China export controls that tightens WFE demand. 3) Ground the analysis in first principles and quantify where possible using the sources: ACMR Q2 revenue 215m, 2025 guidance 850–950m, gross margin 49.4%, net margin 13.8% (SK994CBWR); stock trading ~30.5, consensus target 34.76; ACMR’s 36% quarterly rally (SK994CBWR). 4) Strengthen the linkage between the macro regime and ACMR’s valuation trajectory by stating plausible causal levers (discount-rate compression raising capex/semicapex multiples; potential margin expansion from N2 bubbling tool upgrades). 5) Clarify and reconcile sources: Morningstar’s Russell 2000 regime thesis (Q7VVGNSQE) with ACMR-specific micro catalysts; avoid implying Powell-only guidance when C22MKA9VY centers on rate-cut hopes from Bessent. 6) Richen the watch-list signals: monitor IPO tempo, private-to-public balance shifts, Fed communications, and quarterly ACMR progress toward the 850–950m band; assign a concise confidence note (e.g., base 40–50%, alt 1 25–35%, alt 2 15–25%). 7) Eliminate duplicative source blocks, and attach post‑claim citations after each factual anchor. The result will be a disciplined, testable 3–6 month map with clear triggers/invalidation and a defensible base plus alts. Citations to anchor: (SK994CBWR) (Q7VVGNSQE) (C22MKA9VY).",
