  "description": "Kevin O'Leary reveals the two financial rules his mom taught him that helped him build lasting wealth -- and why they still matter today.",
  "content": "\u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary has built his wealth through entrepreneurship and savvy investing, but he credits his mother for setting him on the right financial path. There are several money lessons his mother taught him throughout his lifetime that still shape how he approaches finances today.\n\nFind Out: Here\u2019s Why You Always Want to Know Your Net Worth, According to a Financial Expert\n\nRead Next: 8 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n\nHere are two of the financial rules O\u2019Leary learned from his mom that he thinks everyone should follow.\n\nKeep Your Own Financial Accounts \u2014 Even in Marriage\n\nWhen you get married, you may want to merge all of your finances \u2014 but O\u2019Leary learned from his mother that this is not the smartest approach.\n\n\u201cMy mother taught me a lot about financial independence,\u201d he told GOBankingRates while discussing his partnership with HelloPrenup, an online prenuptial agreement platform. \u201cShe was married twice but kept a secret account from both of her husbands her entire life.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Leary said that his mother started saving 15% of her pay when she was very young and kept that money completely sequestered during her marriages.\n\n\u201cShe helped my brother and I through school [with that money],\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cShe really believed that in a marriage, both spouses should have their own financial identity. They should never give that up because you don\u2019t know it\u2019s going to happen in marriage.\u201d\n\nLearn More: Here\u2019s Why Couples Fight About Money and How They Can Stop, According to Rachel Cruze\n\nInvest In Fewer, High-Quality Items That Last\n\nAnother lesson O\u2019Leary learned from his mother was to buy a few quality items versus spending money on things that you don\u2019t need or that will fall apart quickly.\n\n\u201cMy mother would only buy two Chanel suits a year, period,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re very expensive. She\u2019d save up for six months to buy one of these suits.\u201d\n\nWhile these suits were a big investment, they held their value over time.\n\n\u201cWhen she passed away, I became the executor for her estate,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cAll of that Chanel stuff \u2014 some of it from the \u201970s and \u201980s, and even some jackets from the \u201960s \u2014 there was a catfight in my family between the women that wanted that stuff.\n\n\u201cThe vintage high-quality clothing is so valuable if it\u2019s well made versus the crap that you buy that just falls apart,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo buy good stuff and keep that in good repair, and it\u2019ll serve you well forever.\u201d\n\u2022 6 Best Items Retirees Should Buy at Costco During Labor Day\n\u2022 4 Things You Should Do When Your Salary Hits $100K\n\u2022 7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Kevin O\u2019Leary: Top 2 Financial Rules From My Mom That I Still Follow",

      "text": "Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Top 4 Tips for Getting Richer\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nIf you are one of the many people out there trying to get rich, or at least trying to push past living paycheck to paycheck, you\u2019ll be able to find thousands of different pieces of advice with a quick online search of varying financial educators. Even though many people have opinions on what you need to do to make more money and build wealth, few have the credibility that Kevin O\u2019Leary has.\nWith an estimated net worth of $400 million, O\u2019Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, is a Canadian businessman and TV personality on the hit show \u201cShark Tank.\u201d He\u2019s one of those credible rich people who made a lot of money through his business ventures over the years and has given a lot of financial tips. Here is some of his best advice for getting and staying rich.\nGet Rich Tip #1: Stop Wasting Your Money\nO\u2019Leary advises against spending money on things you can make at home. Buying a coffee for $5 or a $15 sandwich each day is a terrible financial decision when you can make those yourself for a fraction of the price, and use any extra money you save to pay off debt or pad your retirement account.\nHe says many people starting their careers end up wasting $15,000 a year on these types of products they don\u2019t need. Putting that money toward your savings or investing it will have a much better effect on your financial health over time.\nO\u2019Leary adds that most people spend too much money on clothing. He says if you look in your closet, you\u2019ve most likely got too many pairs of jeans, sneakers and tops that you aren\u2019t wearing. According to him, most people wear only 20% of what they own. Getting this under control means you could cut 15% of your expenses and put it toward a better financial future.\nUp Next: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 6 Steps I Took To Become Rich on an Average Salary\nGet Rich Tip #2: Respect Money\nNo matter your long-term investment strategy or financial plan, no one wants to lose money, but O\u2019Leary doesn\u2019t even want to lose a single dollar. On a podcast with YouTube star Logan Paul, he explained that his mother taught him a simple financial lesson at a young age: \u201cIf you ever disrespect money, you won\u2019t have any.\u201d\nO\u2019Leary\u2019s cold, hard truth is that he goes out of his way to keep every dollar he makes because he works hard for each one. For example, he told a story about how one of his flight tickets didn\u2019t have the frequent flier miles added to it. He spent two hours on the phone with the airline to make sure he received the $400 value of those miles. He also explained that he only buys objects like watches that he expects will appreciate in value.\nTo some, worrying about keeping every dollar may seem inconsequential, but for O\u2019Leary, this is simply respecting the value of money.\nGet Rich Tip #3: Don\u2019t Fear Failure\nWhen asked to advise entrepreneurs fresh out of high school, O\u2019Leary said, \u201cGet ready for failure.\u201d\nBusiness isn\u2019t an easy pursuit and comes with a lot of hard work and ups and downs. O\u2019Leary highlights the fact that it\u2019s impossible to be successful at anything without failing a few times. Failure allows you to grow and motivates you to be successful. He also points out that you only need to be right once to succeed as an entrepreneur.\nGet Rich Tip #4: Tune Out the Noise\nIf you have big dreams of starting a business or making millions from investing, many people will tell you that you won\u2019t be able to do it or that you\u2019re wrong. To this, O\u2019Leary advises you to put your blinders on and focus on what you\u2019re trying to achieve.\nIf you succumb to all of the outside noise, it will eat at you, and you will lose your focus. To succeed, he says, you must focus on your main goal and continue striving for it no matter what happens or what others say.\nCaitlyn Moorhead contributed to the reporting for this article."

      "text": "The Real Reason Couples Fight About Money \u2014 and How To Fix It, According to Rachel Cruze\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nQuestion #2 of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts Series\nWhat\u2019s the best way to handle financial disagreements in a relationship?\nWho doesn\u2019t love a story that ends with \u201cand they lived happily ever after\u201d? Whether it\u2019s a fairy tale or a rom-com, everyone swoons when the pair that belonged together all along finally heads off into the sunset hand in hand.\nYet the story usually ends at this point. There\u2019s no mention of what that happily ever after really looks like \u2014 sharing space, juggling busy schedules and navigating arguments about money.\nPart of merging your life with someone else\u2019s means integrating your finances. Depending on your upbringing, personal history and beliefs, you could be bringing some very different money mindsets to the table \u2014 and serving up a perfect recipe for conflict.\nFortunately, according to Rachel Cruze, bestselling author and financial expert, achieving that \u201chappily ever after\u201d is possible \u2014 even when you\u2019re still figuring out how to manage money as a couple.\nGOBankingRates caught up with Cruze to ask why couples fight about money and what they can do to achieve their own financial harmony.\nIt Goes Deeper Than Dollars and Cents\nSometimes, a fight that seems like it\u2019s all about money isn\u2019t just about dollars and cents. Cruze explained that most financial disagreements stem from deeper emotional issues, like trust, communication and feeling disconnected from your partner.\n\u201cI always say: Money touches every part of your life, from what groceries you buy to the dreams you have for your future,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if there\u2019s tension in how you\u2019re handling money, it\u2019s going to spill over into everything else. That\u2019s why I\u2019m such a big believer in working together, not separately.\u201d\nUnderstanding that there are emotional and philosophical factors at play in how you and your partner think about money is key to having practical, productive conversations about your finances. Cruze\u2019s advice? \u201cStop hiding, start communicating, and get on a plan together.\u201d\nBalancing Money Personalities\nRemember that old Paula Abdul tune, \u201cOpposites Attract\u201d? (You know, the one where she dances with a cartoon cat?) Well, she might have been onto something when it comes to love. And when it comes to money, opposites often do attract, like when a spender marries a saver.\nThat pairing might sound like a recipe for conflict, but Cruze said it can actually be a strength \u2014 if you approach it the right way.\n\u201cThe key is not trying to change each other but learning how to work together,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to set goals as a couple and create a budget that reflects both of your values.\u201d\nShe points to her own marriage as an example. She and her husband, Winston, include \u201cfun money\u201d in their budget so each of them has the freedom to spend a little without guilt or resentment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all part of our shared plan,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember: You\u2019re not two individuals managing money; you\u2019re a team. And teams win when they communicate and stay focused on the same goal.\u201d\nHandling Disagreements\nCruze is quick to remind you that financial disagreements are normal in any relationship. The important thing isn\u2019t avoiding them \u2014 it\u2019s handling them with empathy and honesty.\n\u201cStart by reminding yourself: You\u2019re not enemies. You\u2019re on the same team,\u201d she said. \u201cBe willing to have those tough conversations, really listen, and try to understand where your spouse is coming from.\u201d\nCruze also recommends professional support if you\u2019re feeling stuck.\n\u201cMy friend Dr. Les Parrott says, \u2018Conflict is the price we pay for deeper intimacy.\u2019 And he\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes a good counselor can help too! Just don\u2019t avoid the issue. Facing it head-on with grace and honesty is what brings growth and unity in your marriage.\u201d\nBuilding Unity\nJust like regular date nights help keep the romance alive, you and your partner should also consider a monthly budget check-in to stay financially in sync.\n\u201cJust sit down, look at your income and expenses, and plan where every dollar is going for the month. It doesn\u2019t have to be stressful or super formal,\u201d she said.\nShe and Winston do this every month, and she says it gives them peace of mind and keeps them on the same page.\n\u201cWe also use the EveryDollar budgeting app, which makes it easy for both of us to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d she added.\nEveryDollar is a zero-based budgeting app designed to help individuals and couples assign a purpose to every dollar, making it a practical tool for building unity and staying organized.\n\u201cWhen you make budgeting a routine, it builds trust, reduces stress, and helps you feel like you\u2019re on the same team,\u201d Cruze said.\nBottom Line\nHappily ever after doesn\u2019t just mean candlelit dinners \u2014 it also means coming together to navigate the everyday realities of building a life together, like figuring out your budget.\nIf you follow Rachel Cruze\u2019s advice and lead with communication, create shared goals and build in regular check-ins, you might just argue less, save more and grow stronger together.\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nQuestion #13 of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts Series\nHow do I calculate my net worth, and why does it matter?\nIf net worth sounds like something only the uber-rich have to think about, it\u2019s time to think again. Everyone has a net worth \u2014 though some are certainly higher than others \u2014 but you might be surprised to learn that you\u2019re worth more than you think. More importantly, your net worth is one of the clearest snapshots of your overall financial health.\nDr. Preston D. Cherry, a financial planner who calls himself \u201ca life designer in the world of wealth,\u201d is the founder of Concurrent Wealth Management and author of \u201cWealth in the Key of Life.\u201d He explains how to calculate your net worth, why it matters more than you might realize, and how tracking it over time can help you achieve your biggest financial goals.\nDo This Simple Math\nCalculating your net worth doesn\u2019t require any complicated technology or sifting through boxes of paperwork; it\u2019s a lot simpler than people think, Cherry said. \u201cIt\u2019s just what you own minus what you owe.\u201d To calculate your net worth:\n- Add up your assets: This includes cash, retirement and brokerage accounts, investments, your home and even business equity if you have it.\n- Then subtract your liabilities: These include credit card balances, student loans, auto loans, your mortgage or any other outstanding debts.\nA Snapshot of Your Financial Story\nOnce you calculate that number, Cherry encouraged a mindset shift: don\u2019t think of it as a static figure, but as \u201ca snapshot of your financial story.\u201d In his words, \u201cIt gives you a sense of where you are and a guide to where you\u2019re going.\u201d\nThink of your net worth as your personal financial narrative. \u201cIt tells you where you stand, how far you\u2019ve come, and your aspirational future,\u201d Cherry said. In other words, don\u2019t use it to compare yourself to others, but to measure your progress against your own goals.\nTracking your net worth regularly, such as quarterly or annually, can reveal whether you\u2019re headed in the right direction. It can also highlight blind spots, like lingering debt or underutilized savings opportunities, and bring clarity to future decision-making.\nA Reflection of Your Financial Choices\nAnother way to think of net worth, according to Cherry, is as \u201ca reflection of how your financial choices support your well-being.\u201d If your net worth is on the low side, that may show up as struggling to make ends meet or falling short of your goals.\nThe good news? You can set more aspirational goals and create concrete plans to raise your net worth. \u201cAnd when you see that number grow, you gain confidence \u2014 not just in your finances, but in your future,\u201d Cherry said.\nTake These Steps To Grow Your Net Worth\nGrowing your net worth doesn\u2019t happen on its own unless you already started with millions. Instead, Cherry suggests taking the following steps:\n- Automate and activate saving and investing: Your contributions add up with time and compound growth. Use both employer-sponsored and brokerage accounts. Also, don\u2019t be afraid to take calculated risks at opportune times.\n- Pay down high-interest debt: It might not seem as exciting as \u201cmaking money,\u201d but Cherry pointed out that it\u2019s a guaranteed return on your money.\n- Avoid both lifestyle creep and deprivation: Learn to spend intentionally so you can enjoy life while also increasing your savings as your income grows.\n- Invest in yourself: Money invested in your own education, health, skill-building or personal growth often translates into long-term financial growth.\nConsistency Is Key\nRemember that net worth isn\u2019t built overnight. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s boring,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cIt\u2019s the result of aligning your habits with your values \u2014 and doing so consistently.\u201d Over time, those daily choices can add up to financial clarity and freedom.\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

Whether it\u2019s a fairy tale or a rom-com, everyone swoons when the pair that belonged together all along finally heads off into the sunset hand in hand.\nYet the story usually ends at this point. There\u2019s no mention of what that happily ever after really looks like \u2014 sharing space, juggling busy schedules and navigating arguments about money.\nPart of merging your life with someone else\u2019s means integrating your finances. Depending on your upbringing, personal history and beliefs, you could be bringing some very different money mindsets to the table \u2014 and serving up a perfect recipe for conflict.\nFortunately, according to Rachel Cruze, bestselling author and financial expert, achieving that \u201chappily ever after\u201d is possible \u2014 even when you\u2019re still figuring out how to manage money as a couple.\nGOBankingRates caught up with Cruze to ask why couples fight about money and what they can do to achieve their own financial harmony.\nIt Goes Deeper Than Dollars and Cents\nSometimes, a fight that seems like it\u2019s all about money isn\u2019t just about dollars and cents. Cruze explained that most financial disagreements stem from deeper emotional issues, like trust, communication and feeling disconnected from your partner.\n\u201cI always say: Money touches every part of your life, from what groceries you buy to the dreams you have for your future,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if there\u2019s tension in how you\u2019re handling money, it\u2019s going to spill over into everything else. That\u2019s why I\u2019m such a big believer in working together, not separately.\u201d\nUnderstanding that there are emotional and philosophical factors at play in how you and your partner think about money is key to having practical, productive conversations about your finances. Cruze\u2019s advice? \u201cStop hiding, start communicating, and get on a plan together.\u201d\nBalancing Money Personalities\nRemember that old Paula Abdul tune, \u201cOpposites Attract\u201d? (You know, the one where she dances with a cartoon cat?) Well, she might have been onto something when it comes to love. And when it comes to money, opposites often do attract, like when a spender marries a saver.\nThat pairing might sound like a recipe for conflict, but Cruze said it can actually be a strength \u2014 if you approach it the right way.\n\u201cThe key is not trying to change each other but learning how to work together,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to set goals as a couple and create a budget that reflects both of your values.\u201d\nShe points to her own marriage as an example. She and her husband, Winston, include \u201cfun money\u201d in their budget so each of them has the freedom to spend a little without guilt or resentment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all part of our shared plan,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember: You\u2019re not two individuals managing money; you\u2019re a team. And teams win when they communicate and stay focused on the same goal.\u201d\nHandling Disagreements\nCruze is quick to remind you that financial disagreements are normal in any relationship. The important thing isn\u2019t avoiding them \u2014 it\u2019s handling them with empathy and honesty.\n\u201cStart by reminding yourself: You\u2019re not enemies. You\u2019re on the same team,\u201d she said. \u201cBe willing to have those tough conversations, really listen, and try to understand where your spouse is coming from.\u201d\nCruze also recommends professional support if you\u2019re feeling stuck.\n\u201cMy friend Dr. Les Parrott says, \u2018Conflict is the price we pay for deeper intimacy.\u2019 And he\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes a good counselor can help too! Just don\u2019t avoid the issue. Facing it head-on with grace and honesty is what brings growth and unity in your marriage.\u201d\nBuilding Unity\nJust like regular date nights help keep the romance alive, you and your partner should also consider a monthly budget check-in to stay financially in sync.\n\u201cJust sit down, look at your income and expenses, and plan where every dollar is going for the month. It doesn\u2019t have to be stressful or super formal,\u201d she said.\nShe and Winston do this every month, and she says it gives them peace of mind and keeps them on the same page.\n\u201cWe also use the EveryDollar budgeting app, which makes it easy for both of us to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d she added.\nEveryDollar is a zero-based budgeting app designed to help individuals and couples assign a purpose to every dollar, making it a practical tool for building unity and staying organized.\n\u201cWhen you make budgeting a routine, it builds trust, reduces stress, and helps you feel like you\u2019re on the same team,\u201d Cruze said.\nBottom Line\nHappily ever after doesn\u2019t just mean candlelit dinners \u2014 it also means coming together to navigate the everyday realities of building a life together, like figuring out your budget.\nIf you follow Rachel Cruze\u2019s advice and lead with communication, create shared goals and build in regular check-ins, you might just argue less, save more and grow stronger together.\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

There are several money lessons his mother taught him throughout his lifetime that still shape how he approaches finances today.\nHere are two of the financial rules O\u2019Leary learned from his mom that he thinks everyone should follow.\nKeep Your Own Financial Accounts \u2014 Even in Marriage\nWhen you get married, you may want to merge all of your finances \u2014 but O\u2019Leary learned from his mother that this is not the smartest approach.\n\u201cMy mother taught me a lot about financial independence,\u201d he told GOBankingRates while discussing his partnership with HelloPrenup, an online prenuptial agreement platform. \u201cShe was married twice but kept a secret account from both of her husbands her entire life.\u201d\nO\u2019Leary said that his mother started saving 15% of her pay when she was very young and kept that money completely sequestered during her marriages.\n\u201cShe helped my brother and I through school [with that money],\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cShe really believed that in a marriage, both spouses should have their own financial identity. They should never give that up because you don\u2019t know it\u2019s going to happen in marriage.\u201d\nInvest In Fewer, High-Quality Items That Last\nAnother lesson O\u2019Leary learned from his mother was to buy a few quality items versus spending money on things that you don\u2019t need or that will fall apart quickly.\n\u201cMy mother would only buy two Chanel suits a year, period,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re very expensive. She\u2019d save up for six months to buy one of these suits.\u201d\nWhile these suits were a big investment, they held their value over time.\n\u201cWhen she passed away, I became the executor for her estate,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cAll of that Chanel stuff \u2014 some of it from the \u201970s and \u201980s, and even some jackets from the \u201960s \u2014 there was a catfight in my family between the women that wanted that stuff.\n\u201cThe vintage high-quality clothing is so valuable if it\u2019s well made versus the crap that you buy that just falls apart,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo buy good stuff and keep that in good repair, and it\u2019ll serve you well forever.\u201d"

      "text": "6 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nInvesting Strategies The Wealthy Use That You Should Consider Right Now\nWell done! You\u2019ve worked hard and pinched pennies to finally get to the point where your savings account is looking solid. Now it\u2019s time for the emphasis to shift from saving to making your money work more actively.\nThese moves just might be what you need to keep your money growing. Best of all? It only takes a few minutes to check them out and see which ones are best for you.\nUse an Annuity to Earn Guaranteed Growth on Your Retirement Savings\nOnce you have a substantial nest egg, it's smart to start thinking about your long-term goals and how you can protect what you've built against the unknown -- like a stock market downturn tanking your 401(k) before retirement.\nThat's where an annuity can come in -- they can provide a guaranteed stream of income during retirement at a fixed rate. No stock-market risk involved.\nYou can get started with a Gainbridge\u00ae FastBreak\u2122 annuity with a minimum investment of just $1,000. The more you invest, the higher rate you can earn -- up to 5.80% APY**. The best part? There's no risk to your investment.\nFor context, 5.80% APY is more than 13 times* the average rate on a savings account. Plus, your principal amount is fully protected, unlike when you invest in the stock market.\nThe FastBreak\u2122 annuity is self-directed, easy to set up and comes with 30 days to cancel your contract if you change your mind. Plus you can access up to 10% of your money each year without penalties -- even if you're under 59\u00bd.\nLooking for a predictable, stable way to grow your retirement savings without risking any of your principal investment? Get started here with as little as $1,000 to earn 5.50% APY, or deposit more to earn up to 5.80% APY.\nThey Know You Can Earn Up to a $500 Bonus -- And Boost Your Savings Rate By 10x\nIf you're keeping your dough in a traditional checking account, you're not letting it rise to its full potential. You need an account that lets you earn competitive interest on your everyday balance.\nRaisin, a digital marketplace, makes it easy to find a high-yield savings account with an APY as high as 4.31% -- that's more than 10 times the national average interest on a savings account, which pays just 0.38% APY as of June 16, 2025.\nPlus, when you open an account and deposit funds, you can earn a welcome bonus of up to $500. The more you deposit, the more you can earn.\nThere are no fees from Raisin, and they already have 1 million customers and a 4.5 star rating on Trustpilot.\nWant to start growing your money more than 11 times faster -- and earn up to a $500 bonus? It only takes a few minutes to open an account.\nStop Wasting $1,025 on Your Car Insurance\nOdds are, you're probably paying way too much for your car insurance every month. And it can seriously add up -- to the tune of $1,025 a year.\nFortunately, Insurify lets you compare all your car insurance options at once -- and it can save you up to $1,025 a year.\nJust enter some basic details about your car and background, you'll get customized quotes you can review on your own time and from the comfort of home. Ready to cut your car insurance bill? It's easy to get started here and see how much you can save.\nCollect Rent Checks Without Being a Landlord\nOwning rental property has always been one of the most well-known ways to earn passive income. There's a reason so many rich people do it. There's just one problem -- we can't all afford to just go out and buy an investment property. And we're not exactly dying to be landlords, either.\nLuckily, a company called Arrived lets you invest in rental homes and vacation properties with a minimum investment of just $1,000. The best part? You don't even have to be a landlord. Arrived handles all the nitty gritty work.\nThe process is simple. Just sign up, then browse the available properties, like a single-family rental home in Charlotte, or a vacation rental in the Catskill Mountains. You decide how much you want to invest, then watch for property appreciation and quarterly rental income payments.\nMore than 540,000 people have already invested with Arrived, and it's already paid out $3.5 million in dividends to its investors. Depending on the property and terms of the investment, investing in single-family and vacation-rental properties has historically yielded between 6% and 15% returns.\nWant to start earning passive rental income? Click here to get started and see how much you can earn.\nProtect Your Portfolio With Precious Metals\nIf the past few years have shown us anything, it's that disruptions to the market can come out of nowhere. Between the pandemic, supply-chain issues and bear markets, a lot of people's retirement savings felt the impact.\nThat's why it can be a smart idea to look for ways to protect your retirement savings from the unpredictable. For a lot of people, investing in precious metals is a way to diversify and protect their investments.\nOne way to do this is with a precious metals IRA through a company like Priority Gold. Precious metals often outperform other investments in a volatile market, and their value tends to rise with inflation, making them an effective hedge during uncertain economic times.\nOpening a gold or silver IRA is easy, and you can roll over funds from existing retirement accounts without any taxes or penalty fees. Or you can buy gold and silver directly from Priority Gold's extensive collection.\nWorried you may need to sell your precious metals in the future? Priority Gold offers a no-fee buy-back program. Plus, Priority Gold has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau.\nRight now, Priority Gold is offering up to $10,000 in free silver with qualifying purchases, and you'll get free account setup, free insured shipping and free storage for up to five years.\nWant to diversify and safeguard your investments by adding gold and silver to your portfolio? It's easy to get started here and get your free guide.\nGet Matched with a Financial Advisor for Free\nAs much as we might like to think we have it all figured out, most of us could stand to benefit from an expert opinion -- especially when it comes to our finances. The professionals simply know things we don't.\nBut the idea of getting a financial advisor sounds expensive and tedious. That's why we like a company called WiserAdvisor. They'll match you with a financial advisor in your area -- for free.\nNo two people have the same financial situation, which is why WiserAdvisor matches you with the best financial advisor for your specific situation, so you get an expert in the areas you need.\nThere's no obligation to hire the advisor, and WiserAdvisor screens every advisor to make sure you're only getting matched with the best experts.\nWant to get a customized financial plan? Just start here to get matched with a financial advisor for free.\nBottom Line:\nIt\u2019s just as important to make your money work for you as it is to save. Some key strategies include hedging your savings against inflation with an investment like gold or silver and building passive income through real estate investments. The right financial advisor can give you the best advice for your unique situation.\n*Source: FDIC, national average of savings, week of 02/18/25.

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nWant to grow your money and build lasting wealth? Whether you\u2019re starting from scratch or looking to improve your financial strategy, building wealth is possible with a few simple steps. From increasing your income to investing wisely, here\u2019s how to build wealth in 2025 and beyond.\nKey Principles To Build Wealth\nBuilding wealth is not an overnight process. Here are some key principles to know:\n- Determine your net worth to establish your starting point.\n- Set short-term and long-term financial goals.\n- Earn additional passive income when possible.\n- Automate deposits to your savings accounts.\n- Develop good spending habits and saving strategies.\n- Pay off high-interest debts.\n- Reinvest and diversify as you go.\nHow To Build Wealth: 10 Actionable Steps\nFollow these 10 practical steps to start building lasting wealth.\n1. Start a Business or Side Hustle\nThe wealthiest people in the world are not employees but business founders. Entrepreneurship fulfills two aspects of wealth building: income and high returns on accumulated wealth. Therefore, if you have a business idea that can increase your income, get started.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be a huge business. You can start a small business and offer the services you\u2019re good at.\nFor instance, thanks to the internet, you can create an entirely online-based business. If you\u2019re busy with other things, you can hire people to run the business for you.\nHow Long Does It Take to Build Wealth?\nThe timeline to build wealth varies based on your income, spending and investment strategy. While some achieve great wealth in under 10 years, most people build wealth gradually over decades.\n2. Increase Your Income\nWhether it\u2019s part-time passive income or a higher salary, getting more income is a simple way to grow your wealth.\n- Higher-paying jobs:\n- Look at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to see high-paying jobs and their subcategories.\n- Consider growing your skillset so you can apply for them.\n- Examples of highly-paid professionals include physicians, managers, nurses and engineers.\n- Side hustles:\n- Consider these lucrative side hustles:\n- Working as a virtual assistant\n- Freelance writing and editing\n- Online tutor, coach or consultant\n- Web design, app development or coding\n- Part-time professor at a local college\n- Part-time driver for a ride-sharing or delivery service\n- Consider these lucrative side hustles:\n3. Improve Your Skills\nYou can increase your income by honing your skill set. This could include getting a degree, an MBA or a special designation, which can all earn you a promotion and salary increase.\n4. Create and Stick to a Budget\nA budget is an important tool in wealth creation. It gives you a view of your expenditures \u2014 the things you can cut to increase your savings.\nTo maintain a feasible budget, you should create a new one every month. Can you imagine a sailor without a compass? That\u2019s what a person who spends their money without a budget is like.\nOne of the most popular and effective budgeting techniques is the 50/30/20 rule. This method breaks your income into the following categories:\n- Fifty percent of your income goes to essentials, like food, rent and healthcare.\n- Thirty percent goes to nonessentials, such as shopping and luxury activities.\n- The remaining 20% goes to savings.\n5. Build an Emergency Fund\nEmergency funds prepare you for unexpected events, like losing a job. Such occurrences can disorient your wealth building.\nAim to have three to six months of income saved in your emergency fund for these surprise expenses or events.\n6. Pay Off High-Interest Debt\nDebt \u2014 whether it\u2019s credit card debt, mortgage debt, student loan debt or any other kind \u2014 can pull you down.\nAim to pay off high-interest debt first so you can save money and start building wealth.\n7. Live Below Your Means\nOverspending can dramatically impact your ability to build wealth.\nCut spending on unnecessary things like eating out, buying designer clothes and regular vacations.\nWhile being frugal can be boring and unsatisfying, you\u2019ll amass wealth over time and find it rewarding.\n8. Invest In the Stock Market\nInvesting in stocks is one of the most effective ways to build long-term wealth. Here\u2019s how to get started:\n- Investing in ETFs:\n- ETFs make stock investing simpler and safer for most people.\n- Tend to have lower fees and taxes.\n- Built-in diversification.\n- Buying stocks:\n- Allow you to be a partial owner in companies.\n- Historically offers the highest returns of any asset class.\nKeep In Mind\nStocks carry more risk than other assets \u2014 but they also offer the highest potential returns. Diversifying your portfolio with a mix of ETFs, index funds or REITs can help balance the risk and boost your gains.\n9. Buy Into Real Estate or REITs\nInvesting in real estate investment trusts gives you a chance to profit from the real estate industry without direct involvement. Here are some key points to know:\n- REITs are real estate company stocks involved in buying and selling properties.\n- Mortgage companies also fall into this category.\n- Every time the company\u2019s value increases, you gain as well.\n- REITs boast very high dividends, which you can reinvest for more returns.\n10. Use Retirement Accounts\nRetirement accounts are a key part of building your wealth. Two popular examples include 401(k)s and Roth IRAs.\n- 401(k) accounts:\n- Offered by many employers as a workplace retirement plan.\n- Lets you contribute a percentage of your pre-tax salary through automatic paycheck deductions.\n- Investment earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawn.\n- Roth IRA:\n- Retirement account you open individually \u2014 if your employer doesn\u2019t offer a 401(k).\n- Contributions are made with after-tax dollars.\n- Great for tax-free growth and income in retirement.\nWealth-Building Strategies at a Glance\n| Strategy | Why It Works | How Fast It Builds Wealth |\n|---|---|---|\n| Budgeting and saving | Builds discipline and frees up cash | Moderate |\n| Side hustles | Adds immediate income | Fast |\n| Investing | Long-term growth, compounding and passive income | Moderate to long-term |\n| Retirement accounts | Offers tax advantages and compounding growth | Long-term |\nFinal Take\nBuilding wealth doesn\u2019t require a lucky break \u2014 just consistency, planning and the right strategy. Start by increasing your income, saving consistently and investing for long-term growth. The sooner you begin, the faster your wealth can grow.\nFAQ\nHere are the answers to some frequently asked questions about building wealth.- What is the fastest way to build wealth?\n- Increase your income and invest it consistently. Building a business or pursuing a high-paying career can also speed up the process.\n- How do I start building wealth from nothing?\n- Start by tracking your expenses, creating a budget and building a small emergency fund. From there, automate your savings and consider investing in low-risk options.\n- Is it too late to start building wealth at 40?\n- No, many people hit their peak earning years in their 40s and 50s.\n- How much should I save to build wealth?\n- A good rule of thumb is to save at least 20% of your income.\nCaitlyn Moorhead and Elizabeth Constantineau contributed to the reporting for this article.\nOur in-house research team and on-site financial experts work together to create content that\u2019s accurate, impartial, and up to date.

      "text": "7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\nIt goes without saying that you could use an extra $1,000 this month. Every month, really. Whether you\u2019re standing in the egg aisle watching prices climb or getting closer to a major savings goal, that money could make a real difference. But $1,000 is a large amount of money to make in such a short amount of time. How can you possibly do it?\nFortunately, it\u2019s easier than you might think. You can even make money playing games or exploring investment opportunities on your phone \u2014 things you do anyway. With some simple and fun tasks, you can create shortcuts that put more cash in your wallet each month.\n1. Use an Annuity to Earn Guaranteed Growth on Your Retirement Savings\nIf you want to build wealth, it\u2019s smart to start thinking about your long-term goals and how you can protect what you\u2019ve built against the unknown \u2014 like a stock market downturn tanking your 401(k) before retirement.\nThat\u2019s where an annuity can come in \u2014 they can provide a guaranteed stream of income during retirement at a fixed rate. No stock-market risk involved.\nYou can get started with a Gainbridge\u00ae FastBreak\u2122 annuity with a minimum investment of just $1,000. The more you invest, the higher rate you can earn \u2014 up to 5.80% APY**. The best part? There\u2019s no risk to your investment.\nFor context, 5.80% APY is more than 15 times* the average rate on a savings account. Plus, your principal amount is fully protected, unlike when you invest in the stock market.\nThe FastBreak\u2122 annuity is self-directed, easy to set up and comes with 30 days to cancel your contract if you change your mind. Plus you can access up to 10% of your money each year without penalties \u2014 even if you\u2019re under 59\u00bd.\nLooking for a predictable, stable way to grow your retirement savings without risking any of your principal investment? Get started here with as little as $1,000 to earn 5.50% APY, or deposit more to earn up to 5.80% APY.\n2. Grow Your Money More Than 10x Faster (And Earn Up to $500 as a Bonus)\nIf you\u2019re keeping your dough in a traditional checking account, you\u2019re not letting it rise to its full potential. You need an account that lets you earn competitive interest on your everyday balance.\nRaisin, a digital marketplace, makes it easy to find a high-yield savings account with an APY as high as 4.31% \u2014 that\u2019s more than 10 times the national average interest on a savings account, which pays just 0.38% APY as of June 16, 2025.\nPlus, when you open an account and deposit funds, you can earn a welcome bonus of up to $500. The more you deposit, the more you can earn.\nThere are no fees from Raisin, and they already have 1 million customers and a 4.5 star rating on Trustpilot.Want to start growing your money more than 11 times faster \u2014 and earn up to a $500 bonus? It only takes a few minutes to open an account.\n3. Stop Wasting $1,025 a Year on Car Insurance\nSometimes, the most effective way to save money is to stop spending it on overpriced services \u2014 like insurance that is far more expensive than it should be.\nOver time, those extra costs can add up to hundreds of dollars per year. To pump the brakes on this excess spending, use Insurify, a platform that lets you easily compare car insurance policies \u2014 and it can save you up to $1,025 a year.\nOn a single platform, you can browse insurance offerings from some of the most respected providers. After entering basic details about your needs, you\u2019ll receive customized quotes that you can review on your own time from the comfort of your own home.\nWant to add up to $1,025 back to your wallet this year? It\u2019s easy to get started here and see how much you can save.\n4. Earn Passive Real-Estate Income \u2014 With Just $1K\nOwning rental property has always been one of the most well-known ways to earn passive income. There\u2019s just one problem. We can\u2019t all afford to just go out and buy a rental property.\nLuckily, a company called Arrived lets you invest in rental homes and vacation properties with a minimum investment of just $100 in some cases.

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 YearsHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed by Experts\nTrusted by Millions of Readers\nOne of the best methods for living within your means is choosing not to buy expensive things. Instead, consumers can swap out generic or \u201cdupe\u201d items. These look and work just like their more expensive counterparts, but cost a lot less money.\nThat said, certain expensive items just can\u2019t be duped. From pets to plants, these purchases deliver an incredible return on investment that pays off in the short and long term. In a recent video, frugal living YouTuber Austin Williams outlined the top 20 expensive purchases that are worth it.\nKeep reading to find out which items made the cut.\nPets\nWilliams is a proud owner of a pet dog named Star. The costs associated with keeping Star happy and healthy might not be cheap, but Williams doesn\u2019t mind picking up the tab for his pup.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than having your dog cuddle with you at the end of the day and give you some love,\u201d he said.\nCoworking Space Membership\nIt\u2019s easy to start feeling lonely if you\u2019re self-employed or work predominantly from home. To combat feelings of isolation, Williams recommends investing in a membership to a local coworking space. (His membership costs $100 every month.)\n\u201cGoing somewhere to work has completely changed my life because it breaks up the day by going somewhere,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt allows me to interact with other human beings and enjoy being home after a day out.\u201d\nGood Shoes\nNever skimp on purchases that touch the ground. Williams recommends investing in a high-quality pair of sneakers. Good shoes are vital if you exercise frequently or are regularly on the go.\nGood Sheets\nQuality sheets, and overall bedding, doesn\u2019t have to cost you a ton of money. Williams cited the example of Threshold 400-count sheets that he purchased from Target for $60.\nLiving in a Fun Area\nOne non-negotiable expense for Williams is living in a location that\u2019s fun and has a lot of activities to engage in. Previously, he lived in Ecuador and Colorado and now resides in Atlanta.\nThough Williams said he pays much more for rent than he would if he lived in a suburb, he doesn\u2019t mind paying more to live in an engaging area where he can walk everywhere.\nWilliams explained, \u201cIf I lived in a cookie cutter suburb that is dependent on cars, I would be miserable.\u201d\nWell-Decorated Home\n\u201cHaving a home with nice decorations, a home that creates a cozy environment, is well worth the money,\u201d Williams said. \u201cCreating a positive, comfortable home is key to be happy.\u201d\nPlants\nAs expensive as plants can be, Williams said they\u2019re worth every penny because they brighten up living spaces. Plus, it can be equally just as therapeutic to look after plants.\nGiant Whiteboard\nWilliams said one purchase he made that is well worth the $200 spent on it is a giant two-sided whiteboard. This whiteboard allows him to channel his inner creative and jot down new ideas, put together to-do lists or simply doodle.\nElectric Toothbrush\nWilliams doesn\u2019t see an expensive toothbrush as a luxury buy, but rather an investment in the care and keeping of your teeth. He recommends investing in an electric toothbrush over a manual toothbrush as it helps prevent cavities.\nDining Out When You Don\u2019t Feel Like Cooking\nEven though Williams often speaks about the importance of cooking meals to save money, he said he does eat out two to four times a week.\n\u201cThere are some days that I just do not want to cook dinner,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWhenever I feel this way, I will just get takeout. I like to limit myself on this, but in the moments where I just do not want to cook I do not feel guilty about getting takeout.\u201d\nMaking a Large Purchase? Get the Cash You Need\nYouTube Premium\nWilliams personally prefers YouTube Premium over most streaming platforms and spends $15 a month to watch YouTube ad-free.\nDesigner Prescription Glasses\nWilliams, who wears glasses when he\u2019s not on camera, said it\u2019s worth it to spend a couple hundred dollars on a pair of designer prescription glasses that are comfortable to wear.\nAnd even though he\u2019s aware some people may consider designer glasses to be not worth the money, he sees a lot of value in buying attractive frames that make you feel good about yourself.\nPrescription Sunglasses\nFor years, Williams said, he wore cheap sunglasses that weren\u2019t comfortable or tailored to his vision. He has since invested in a pair of prescription sunglasses that make being outside a much more pleasant experience.\nBattery-Powered Drill\nBattery-powered drills come in handy as you work on DIY projects around the house, like setting up new bookshelves, and keep you from paying extra money to hire a professional.\nGlass Food Storage Containers\nTo combat excessive plastic consumption, Williams purchased glass food storage containers to store his food inside. These containers also make it easier to organize food and leftovers in the refrigerator.\nGood Computer\nA reliable, fast computer is a must-have, especially if you work remotely or are self-employed.\nThis purchase doesn\u2019t need to be expensive either. Williams said your money will go a lot further if you invest in a PC over a MacBook.\nHigh-Quality Clothing\nInvesting in high-quality apparel is something Williams started doing only recently, but he already sees the value in it because the clothing lasts longer and looks better.\nHe used the example of a T-shirt he purchased for over $60. This was more money than he had ever spent on a T-shirt; but, for all the months he has owned it, the shirt hasn\u2019t faded or worn out.\nInternational Travel\nWilliams, who has been to over 40 countries and spent tens of thousands of dollars on international travel, believes it\u2019s worth every penny. Travel forces you out of your comfort zone and allows you to become a more compassionate human being.\nA Car With No Problems\nThere\u2019s a great deal of value to be found in owning a reliable vehicle that you can drive across the country and not have to worry about it breaking down.\nSelf-Employment\nWilliams said he has been self-employed for the last two and a half years. As expensive as it is \u2014 and it\u2019s not cheap to pay more in taxes and health insurance \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t want to go back to being a corporate employee again.\n\u201cBeing self-employed is such a character building experience,\u201d he said, \u201cand all these expenses are well worth the money.\u201d\nShare This Article:\nYou May Also Like\n6 Best Items To Buy at Dollar Tree Now for the Second Half of 2025 To Save Big Money\nAugust 22, 2025\n7 min Read\nI'm a Dollar Tree Superfan: 2 Ways To Save Money Using Its Rewards Program\nAugust 20, 2025\n7 min Read\n4 Popular Kirkland Items Discontinued at Costco -- How To Replace Them for Cheap\nAugust 20, 2025\n7 min Read\nMake your money work for you\nGet the latest news on investing, money, and more with our free newsletter.\nThanks!\nSending you timely financial stories that you can bank on.\nSign up for our daily newsletter for the latest financial news and trending topics.\nFor our full Privacy Policy, click here.\nLooks like you're using an adblocker\nPlease disable your adblocker to enjoy the optimal web experience and access the quality content you appreciate from GOBankingRates.\n- AdBlock / uBlock / Brave\n- Click the ad blocker extension icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable on this site\n- Refresh the page\n- Firefox / Edge / DuckDuckGo\n- Click on the icon to the left of the address bar\n- Disable Tracking Protection\n- Refresh the page\n- Ghostery\n- Click the blue ghost icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable Ad-Blocking, Anti-Tracking, and Never-Consent\n- Refresh the page"

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nCostco works hard to keep its prices low, but it often offers sales at key holidays and junctures throughout the year, like Labor Day on Sept. 1. You might have the added bonus of quieter shopping hours, with people away on vacation, or you can always order online from the comfort of your home.\nRetirees, who often have reduced income and are living on tighter budgets, can find a wide variety of goods ranging from grocery and home goods to clothing and tech at good prices. Here are six of the best items to buy during Labor Day.\nKirkland Vitamins\nKeeping an aging body healthy can feel like a full-time job you have to attack from all angles. The best way may be from the inside out \u2014 key vitamins can really support the health of older adults. Get 500 tablets of 600 mg Kirkland calcium supplements for $13.99 for sturdier bones, or 280 tablets of Kirkland glucosamine and chondroitin to support joint health for $27.99.\nBulk Coffee\nNow you finally have the time to truly sit and enjoy every cup of coffee without rushing, and you can save money by making it at home. Costco has a variety of coffee available at great deals, but why not stick with its tried-and-true Kirkland signature house blend, with a flavor that\u2019s \u201cbalanced and smooth.\u201d You can get 2 1/2 pounds of whole beans for $19.39. Whole beans are better for storing in the freezer for longevity, too.\nHealthy Frozen Meals\nFrozen foods allow retirees to buy in bulk and save on money, trips to the store and meal planning. Invest in healthy frozen staples, either in complete meals like Bibigo steamed chicken and vegetable dumplings for $15.54. Or check out Kirkland signature frozen stir-fry vegetable blend, just $11.39 for 5 1/2 pounds of a healthy mix of your favorite vegetables to which you can just add rice, pasta, protein and more with your favorite sauce for a quick and easy meal.\nToilet Paper\nCostco is an essential stop for household staples that you use frequently, such as paper goods, cleaning supplies and the like. Save yourself time and money by buying Kirkland signature bath tissue, with two-ply thickness and 380 sheets across 30 rolls, for just $24.99.\nWalking Support\nIf your body needs extra support when walking or even shopping, Costco has you covered there, too. Consider this Medline rolling walker with seat. It helps you walk, provides a comfy seat for resting and is affordably priced for such a sturdy tool, just $139.99.\nBatteries\nLet\u2019s face it, we live in an ever more automated life, powered by smart tech, appliances and devices that require batteries to run them. If you\u2019re spending any time traveling in an RV or similar, you might have an even greater need for batteries. Kirkland signature 48-count of AA batteries is just $15.99 and will keep your devices from running out of juice.\nEditor\u2019s note: Pricing is accurate as of Aug. 13, 2025. Pricing and availability are subject to change."

Now, there\u2019s so much to do, like booking the perfect venue, finding the best clothes and hiring a photographer who will capture your love (and your best angles). Oh, and the cake testing. Can\u2019t forget about that. Or pie, if you\u2019re more eccentric.\nHowever, there\u2019s another kind of planning you\u2019ll want to tackle before you join your lives in holy matrimony \u2014 or in front of an Elvis at a drive-in chapel \u2014 and it\u2019s not as glamorous as finding your DJ. You\u2019ve got to think about the nitty-gritty of merging your lives, and that includes your finances.\nSome accounts make sense to merge or open jointly. Others should remain separate, either for legal reasons or personal financial security. Here\u2019s what to know.\nShare Accounts for Paying Bills\nWhen you share a life, you share expenses. After all, electricity and water usage aren\u2019t calculated by individual user. And it\u2019s not like you both don\u2019t wait for each other to stream your favorite shows (except for that one time someone cheated with the new episode of \u201cSeverance\u201d while the other was on a work trip, but let\u2019s not talk about that). It makes sense for you to keep a joint account for your bills.\nTaylor Kovar, founder and CEO of 11 Financial, works with many couples looking to learn how to approach their finances in their new life as a legal couple. He\u2019s generally a fan of keeping things simple and unified by combining major accounts, like checking accounts used for paying bills.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about working together as one team. One mind, one accord, one family. This setup makes it easier to manage things and fosters unity in the relationship,\u201d he said.\nShare Savings and Invest Accounts\nThe family that builds wealth together, stays together. That\u2019s why Kovar also recommends that couples combine savings and investment accounts. This not only helps you save and invest more effectively as a pair, but it\u2019s also a powerful way to deepen your trust in each other as you work together toward your goals.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think separate accounts are necessary,\u201d Kovar said. \u201cIn fact, they can sometimes cause confusion, resentment, and unnecessary questions.\u201d\nKeeping finances separate when it isn\u2019t necessary could even open the door to financial infidelity. According to Kovar, working from a shared account ensures that both partners will be more open in their communication and work from a unified front.\nKeep Separate Accounts for Children From Previous Relationships\nSometimes, a partner enters a marriage with children from a previous relationship. Ideally, this is a case of \u201cthe more the merrier,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t mean a new spouse should immediately take on the considerable financial responsibility of supporting those children.\nIn those instances, Kovar suggests it may be wiser and smoother for the parent to maintain a separate account dedicated to their children\u2019s needs.\nKeep Separate Accounts if You Want To\nJust as there is no one way to have a perfect marriage, there\u2019s no one way to allocate your finances within that marriage. While Kovar generally favors a \u201cone family\u201d approach, he said that if one partner feels strongly about keeping their finances separate, they should.\nAdditionally, if one partner is working on healing their relationship with money, such as curbing overspending, maintaining separate accounts for a while can help.\n\u201cIt gives both partners space to work on their financial habits without worrying about the other person\u2019s spending,\u201d he said.\nAs you prepare to tie the knot, Kovar suggests learning each other\u2019s financial personalities. This ensures your happily ever after includes being on the same page money-wise, helping you avoid money conflicts and build a solid financial future together.\nMore From GOBankingRates"

You\u2019ve reached a significant milestone: a six-figure salary. But with this achievement comes the responsibility of managing your new income wisely.\nAs you celebrate, you\u2019ll want to start thinking about how to maximize your earning potential, both for your immediate needs and your long-term financial goals. By following a few smart money moves, you can make the most of what you\u2019re making. Here are four smart strategies that can help you protect your new earnings and grow your wealth.\n1. Maximize Your Retirement Contributions\nNow that you\u2019re earning $100K, it\u2019s time to focus on boosting your retirement savings. If you haven\u2019t already, see if you can max out your contributions to your employer\u2019s 401(k) plan, or at least get as close as possible. For 2025, the contribution limit is $23,500 \u2014 this is a great chance to really ramp up your retirement fund.\nBut don\u2019t stop there. Think about tax-diversifying your retirement savings. If your salary continues to rise, it might be a good idea to open a Roth IRA now, while you\u2019re still eligible to contribute. This will allow your savings to grow tax-free, and when you retire, your withdrawals will also generally be tax-free provided you meet the eligibility standards for withdrawals. Incorporating a mix of tax-deferred and tax-free accounts into your strategy gives you more flexibility when it\u2019s time to withdraw funds in retirement.\nYou can also supplement your retirement savings with annuities from New York Life, which give you the freedom to choose your risk level. Looking for lower risk and guaranteed future income? An income annuity could give you that peace of mind. Comfortable with market risk to potentially grow your money faster? There are variable annuities that could fit your needs.\nIf you\u2019re not sure which retirement account is best for you, working with a New York Life financial professional can help you set up a plan that suits your needs and goals.\n2. Work with a Financial Service Professional\nOnce you\u2019ve achieved your six-figure salary, you might find yourself in a maze of choices. There are so many decisions to be made about how you\u2019ll apply your extra income to your savings plans and retirement accounts. Then there\u2019s the matter of what to do with the kids\u2019 college funds or your own investment portfolio.\nA trustworthy financial services professional can guide you through these decisions, and finding one doesn\u2019t have to be difficult. Through New York Life and its affiliate NYLIFE Securities LLC, you can tap into a network of more than 12,000 agents who are prepared to help you build strategies customized to your specific needs and desires.\nThese experts are highly knowledgeable about world-class financial products and services that can help you achieve your goals more easily, whether you\u2019re looking to retire early or pay for your child\u2019s education. By building a long-term relationship with a financial professional, you\u2019ll also have someone on your team who can help you adjust your plans as life changes.\n3. Explore New Ways of Investing\nUp to this point, your sole foray into investing might have been participating in your employer\u2019s 401(k) plan, which probably has limited investing options. Now that your paycheck is bigger, it\u2019s time to broaden your investment strategy as well. You can invest in index funds, exchange-traded funds, individual stocks and more in a brokerage account or IRA. Seeking greater upside potential coincides with taking greater risk.\nIf you\u2019ve always had an interest in real estate, now might be the perfect time to dive in. You could invest in a real estate investment trust, or REIT, which is a company that owns, and often operates, income-producing real estate. If you\u2019re ready for a more hands-on approach, you could purchase commercial or residential properties yourself and manage them as a landlord.\n4. Ensure Your Family\u2019s Protection with Insurance\nAs you focus on putting your additional earnings toward building wealth, it\u2019s just as important to think about protecting your family\u2019s future. If your salary is any indication, you\u2019re already providing in a big way \u2014 so you want to make sure they\u2019re taken care of, even in the event of your death or disability. This is where life and disability insurance come into play.\nWith a strong insurance plan in place, you can ensure your loved ones will be financially secure, even if something unexpected happens and you\u2019re no longer able to provide in the same way you do now. New York Life offers a range of insurance products designed to fit your needs, giving you peace of mind knowing they\u2019ll be taken care of, no matter what life throws your way."

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nMany a rom-com ends with a final kiss, stopping just short of what the reality of \u201chappily ever after\u201d might look like. There\u2019s the chores to divide. The TV shows to share (while resisting the urge to skip ahead). The finances to mingle \u2014 starting, in many cases, with a joint checking account.\nCreating this account carries far more emotional weight than setting up a checking or savings account as a single person. It\u2019s a sign of trust with your shared resources, including your hard-earned money \u2014 calling for both partners to be in sync when it comes to their approach to money. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial to establish clear ground rules to protect your money and your relationship.\nGOBankingRates sought out insights from experts with a background in psychology who could speak to this common yet highly personal financial decision. Here\u2019s what they say you should do before setting up a joint account with your partner.\nMake a Commitment to Transparency\nThe foundation of any strong relationship is transparency, and money matters are no exception. In an interview with Brides magazine, Katie Dorman, certified financial therapist and owner of Sound Financial Therapy LLC, emphasized the need for transparency when setting up a joint account: \u201cCouples using a joint bank account are working with the same information. Both are aware of how much money is coming in and going out as a household.\u201d\nTo maintain financial clarity, make transparency your top priority. Be candid about the kinds of purchases you plan to make with the account, and make it a point to review your statements together. If you\u2019re considering making a purchase using the account and you haven\u2019t discussed it with your partner in advance, it\u2019s better to check in before checking out of the store.\nHave a Shared Vision About How You\u2019ll Use the Account\nWhile it might be easier to allow one person to manage household finances \u2014 especially if that practice aligns with certain gender roles you\u2019ve observed in your family \u2014 resentment can build over time if one partner feels left out of financial decisions.\nDorman told Brides that setting expectations about how you\u2019ll each use the account is essential for successfully managing it. Together, you should come to a consensus about what kinds of expenses the account will cover.\nShould it only be for necessities? Major expenses, like household appliances? Are splurges allowed, and if so, should they stay under a certain limit? When can you or your partner make emergency purchases without consulting each other?\nYou should be willing to talk openly about your feelings and values around money, and encourage your partner to do the same. Being on the same page about money will lead to a stronger relationship, and being candid \u2014 even vulnerable \u2014 about your financial history can only deepen your trust and intimacy.\nCommit to Monitoring the Account Together\nJust as you\u2019d carefully monitor your own bank accounts, you\u2019ll need to keep an eye on your joint account \u2014 and make sure tracking its activity is a shared effort. Both partners should be aware of the account balance and adjust spending accordingly if funds are running low.\n\u201cIf only one person is regularly reviewing the account, this can lead to financial conflict, as well as resentment,\u201d Dorman warned.\nBy keeping an open dialogue and checking in on your finances together, you can avoid misunderstandings and keep your relationship \u2014 and your bank account \u2014 on solid ground. After all, money is just one part of the equation. At the end of the day, what matters most is that you and your partner feel like a team, working toward the same goals.\nMore From GOBankingRates"
