  "content": "\u2022 Mediatek CPUs and memory fuse with Nvidia GPUs in GB10 superchip collaboration\n\u2022 Regulatory hurdles aside, GB10 shows transformative potential of their partnership\n\nMediatek\u2019s role in Nvidia\u2019s GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip has been made clear in a new presentation, so should Nvidia chief Jensen Huang be considering a $73 billion acquisition of the Taiwanese company?\n\nThe GB10, originally due in July 2025 but delayed, is presented as a blend of Mediatek\u2019s CPU and memory designs with Nvidia\u2019s GPU expertise.\n\nBy leaning on Mediatek\u2019s system-on-chip experience, Nvidia has been able to demonstrate how industry standard interfaces and protocols can tie its Blackwell GPU into a compact and efficient package.\n\nThat collaboration, formally acknowledged in the presentation, is what leads me to speculate on a deeper corporate tie-up.\n\nNvidia has shown a willingness to pursue large acquisitions in the past, such as its failed $40 billion bid for Arm back in 2022.\n\nRegulators blocked that deal, citing competition concerns, and a similar challenge would likely face any attempt to buy Mediatek.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s government could also be reluctant to see one of its most valuable semiconductor firms acquired by a US company.\n\nEven so, Nvidia\u2019s reliance on Mediatek in GB10 highlights the strategic importance of the partnership.\n\nMediatek is a major player in smartphone SoCs, and with Nvidia aiming to expand ARM-based chips into laptops and gaming devices, owning the company could give it both technology and supply chain expertise.\n\nWith an estimated $73 billion valuation, acquiring Mediatek wouldn\u2019t be cheap, but Nvidia could certainly afford it, given its rapid rise in market capitalization.\n\nFor the moment, the GB10 is a great example of what the two tech giants can achieve when working together.\n\nIt combines 20 Arm v9.2 CPU cores, Blackwell-based graphics cores with 31 TFLOPs of FP32 performance, and up to 128GB unified LPDDR5X memory in a dual-dielet package on TSMC\u2019s N3 process.\n\nRegardless of whether or not Nvidia would entertain acquiring Mediatek, the GB10 confirms that the two firms are already closely tied in both technology and strategy.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 These are the best mobile workstations you can buy right now\n\u2022 China could move away from Nvidia AI chips quicker than expected\n\u2022 Nvidia reveals next generation \"robot brain\" chip, and it can be yours for less than a used car",

      "text": "Best mobile workstations of 2025: Top picks for power, productivity, and portability\nWe reviewed the best mobile workstations for when performance is critical\nThe best mobile workstation combines power with portability. We've run the benchmarks and extensively reviewed each model here to ensure that when you need high performance, these workstation laptops will deliver.\nMy team and I have tested the best workstations and best business laptops to find machines capable of powering through a range of tasks. Yes, these mobile workstations may be heavier than traditional laptops, but each of these devices offer flawless performance for a range of complex workloads, including engineering, CAD, 3D modeling, high-resolution content creation, and more.\nWith that in mind, the Dell Precision 5690 stands out as the best mobile workstation for most people, although I'd still recommend checking out the MacBook Pro (M4 Pro) for those working on graphically intensive tasks like video editing. You can read the full reviews below, where we put each of these robustly designed mobile workstation laptops through their paces to ensure they hit the right balance of productivity, portability, and power where it counts.\nThe best mobile workstation overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Dell Precision 5690 is a sleek, powerful, and portable workstation designed to meet the high demands of professionals in the business world. Whether you are running complex code, complex simulations, dancing between multiple resource-intensive apps, or something similar, this workstation has you covered with its Core i9 processor.\nWe were strongly impressed with the overall performance of this machine during our review. We experienced no performance issues, with the Precision 5690 flying through every task we threw at it. Naturally, it handled the usual office apps and software - emails, web browsing, spreadsheets - but we also tried photo and video editing and programming, and it didn't even flinch. Having run the benchmarks, this should be a top pick for anyone in engineering, running complex code bases, CAD, and 3D modeling.\nEven with the power do do all that, we still found it relatively portable (for its size, at least), and our battery tests showed it hit almost eleven hours on a single charge. For a mobile workstation, that's pretty impressive. The 16-inch 4K OLED display also provides clarity and accurate colors, making it great for visual-heavy tasks.\nOn the other hand, it's still pretty expensive - I'd consider this more of an investment, particularly if you future-proof it with the right components. Nor is it going to be the best mobile workstation if you're performing graphically intensive projects, with the focus more on complex business workloads. On that score, though, the Precision 5690 ticks all the boxes.\nRead our full Dell Precision 5690 review.\nThe best Mac mobile workstation\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe MacBook Pro powered by the M4 Pro combines sleek design with unparalleled performance, and is only outpaced by the M4 Max chipset. However, in our experience, the M4 Pro is so good that the cost is only worth it to those who somehow find themselves pushing the M4 Pro chip, which we found incredibly hard to do.\nThis mobile workstation is purpose-built for demanding professionals who need cutting-edge speed and efficiency, all in a portable workstation that still looks great. And that's exactly what it delivered under our tests, capable of multi-tasking in Chrome with twenty different tabs to high-resolution video editing without slowdown. If you're predominantly working in programming, I'd opt for this device over a Windows machine, since you have the option of booting in both macOS and Windows.\nIt might not offer the biggest jump in performance compared to the M3 Max, but we still saw a noticeable bump in the benchmark tests we ran. With up to 64GB of unified memory, up to 8TB of storage, advanced CPU and GPU cores, a ProMotion Liquid Retina display, and a full 16-inches of real estate, it offers everything most people will need from a mobile workstation laptop.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro) review.\nThe best mobile workstation on a budget\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNo matter what you\u2019re looking for in a workstation laptop, the MacBook Pro 16-inch can probably handle it. That\u2019s thanks to Apple\u2019s in-house M1 Pro and M1 Max (if you choose to upgrade) that can blaze through any application you can think of. It might not be as powerful as the newer models with the M4 Pro chips, but for a cheap mobile workstation, it's still an impressive machine.\nThe laptop comes with an incredible display that'll eliminate the need to plug into an external monitor, as well as plenty of ports, including next-gen Thunderbolt 4 ports. Even today, the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips can tear through creative projects, crushing heavy coding, and absolutely killing it everywhere else. As a testament to the M1 processor, it's impressive for how strong this mobile workstation is.\nIt's admittedly a heavy device (you could opt for the 14-inch model is you don't need the extra screen real estate), but for the power and the impressively long battery life, I'd still opt for the MacBook 16-inch where available.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Pro 16-Inch (M1) review.\nYou could save on Apple products with our Apple promo codes.\nThe best mobile workstation for designers and gamers\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Razer Blade 14 (2024) is a remarkably powerful mobile workstation designed to appeal to the mobile gamers and designers who need high performance in a compact package with a bit of gamer design. It's equipped with an AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 GPU, outputting impressive performance across all creative workflows such as video editing, photo editing, graphic design, 3D rendering, and some gaming for when the workday is over (or just beginning if you are a professional gamer).\nThe 14-inch QHD+ display with 240Hz refresh rate is fantastic for producing vibrant, color-accurate visuals, making it perfect for those creative professionals who care about spending the extra money on a machine that cares as much as they do. It's pretty slim and lightweight, made from aluminum, promoting portability and durability.\nNaturally, no computer can be perfect. The Razer Blade 14 (2024) could have a better battery, and we wish it had an SD Card reader. However, for the price and the overall performance, I think we can handle a dongle like the rest of the laptop world.\nRead our full Razer Blade 14 (2024) review.\nThe best 2-in-1 mobile workstation\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThere are very few laptops more powerful than the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 8. The 2-in-1 workhorse is encased in aluminum, making it a robust option for any commute. True, the design of the ThinkPad Yoga series hasn't undergone much change over the years, but it's a tried-and-true design, so we can't really complain.\nWe've had the opportunity to test several ThinkPads over the years, and without fail, every time, we're left suitably impressed. The Gen 8 is no different. We found it fast, with a crisp 16:10 screen and an impressively comfortable keyboard built for constant use. For the latest model, you can check out our Lenovo Thinkpad X1 2-in-1 Gen 9 business laptop review, but we found it didn't quite match up to the previous generation.\nConnectivity is good - to the left, you'll find an HDMI, USB-A, and two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports. To the right, there is a headphone jack and a second USB-A port. Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.1 are built-in, with a 5G option available for the ultimate mobile workstation. All in all, our tests revealed a portable powerhouse - but performance this good comes at an admittedly high price.\nRead our full Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 8 review.\nThe best mobile workstation desktop-replacement\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 7 is a wonderful powerhouse workstation that combines desktop-level performance with the fantastic portability of a laptop.\nDesigned for even some of the heaviest workloads, this machine is powered by an Intel Core i9-13950HX processor and NVIDIA RTX A5500 graphics, ensuring seamless performance for tasks like 3D modeling, video editing, software development, coding, web design, and other hefty business use cases.\nThe 16-inch UHD+ display makes using this computer as visually pleasant as it is powerful. This display offers brilliant colors and visuals all on a fairly large display, especially for a portable workstation designed to replace a full desktop.\nAs an alternative, we were strongly impressed by the performance of the P16 (check out our Lenovo ThinkPad P16 Gen 2 review here).\nRead our full Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 7.\nThe best mobile workstation for portability\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12 is a wildly lightweight, ultraportable workstation that does not sacrifice power for its incredible mobility. It's equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 7 165U Processor and up to 32GB of RAM, making it possible to tackle any business task you throw at it. It's perfect for professionals on the go who need to keep up their productivity thanks to its lightweight design.\nThe one downside to this computer is that while it's incredible for traditional business tasks, it does not have a high-quality screen or an impressive GPU, meaning that you're not going to want to edit videos or photos on this guy. But for traditional business, non-media tasks, and projects, this computer is an incredible option.\nNote: the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 is in our hands and is currently in review.\nRead our full Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12.\nHow to choose the best mobile workstation for you\n- We asked Anu Herranen, Director of New Product Introduction, Advanced Compute and Solutions at HP Inc, how to choose a workstation.\n\"There are a couple of basic questions you need to ask yourself before choosing a workstation. The first is simply to think about the work you need it to support. Do you need fantastic graphics performance, or to analyze huge data sets in hours, rather than days? Do you need to be able to do a range of tasks concurrently? Which applications or operating system are you relying on?\nThe next step is to think more broadly about how and where you will use your workstation. Are you always in the field, therefore need a lightweight device, combined with great battery life? Or like so many of us today, do you need something that you can use at home, but doesn\u2019t take up much space so you\u2019re able to hide it away when not working? What audio experience do you need? Do you need to be able to work collaboratively?\nReliability is another key factor in choosing a workstation PC. Imagine that you are in a hospital environment analyzing CT scans: your computer needs to run 24/7 all year round and must never fail. Likewise, a NASA astronaut in a space station cannot ever take the risk of having their computer fail due to system crashes, component breakdowns and sluggish performance.\nSome have undergone hundreds of thousands of hours of extensive testing under extreme conditions, where frequency, voltage and temperature are varied in such a way that it goes beyond what one could call normal operating conditions.\"\nHow we test the best mobile workstations\n\u2705 More than 1,800 laptops, Chromebooks, and MacBooks reviewed\n\u2705 15 years of product testing\n\u2705 Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2705 Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nOur team of experts have tested a range of business-use devices from the best MacBook Pro and the best Lenovo ThinkPad laptops to the best laptops for video editing.\nWhen evaluating the performance of any machine, including the best mobile workstations, we looked at how the workstations run different types of applications \u2014 from graphics-heavy programs and apps like the best video editing software to large data sets.\nWe analyzed numerous specs, like CPU, RAM, graphics, and storage, to determine what kinds of users the workstation would be best suited for. We considered how many connectivity ports the workstation had, whether the fan was noisy, and if the laptop would get hot with prolonged use.\nAnother key area we assessed was the laptop\u2019s portability and battery life. Having already tested the best rugged laptops, we were looking for machines that were reliability robust but sleek and light enough to carry on the commute. So, we assessed size, weight, and design of all mobile workstations to find the ones best suited to the professional lifestyle.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says talks with Trump to allow chips into China will take time\nNvidia is yet to reach a deal with the US to sell chips to China\n- Nvidia\u2019s China-specific H20 chips are off-sale, but scaled-down Blackwell chips could be approved\n- China is a $50 billion opportunity for Nvidia, with potential for 50% annual growth\n- China may not want to buy Nvidia chips over supposed security risks and US comments\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that discussions with the US Government on allowing scaled-down Blackwell GPU sales to China have started, but it could take time to reach a deal.\nAccording to Reuters reporting, Trump indicated that Nvidia could sell a less powerful version of Blackwell to China that\u2019s 30-50% less capable than the regular version.\nHowever, the White House fears that even stripped-down AI chips could support China\u2019s military and technological strength, hence the delays that Nvidia is facing with regards to a decision.\nNvidia may be able to start selling low-performance Blackwell chips in China again\nHuang estimates that China represents a $50 billion opportunity for Nvidia, potentially growing 50% annually if access to sell chips in the country is allowed. For a company with $46.7 billion in quarterly revenue, that\u2019s a considerable opportunity.\nNvidia had already made the H20 AI chip for China to meet Biden-era export restrictions, but that got banned over security concerns when Trump came to power. Sales of the H20 in China are still on pause, but at an expense to Nvidia which is losing out on billions in sales.\nIn the meantime, China has been promoting the use of domestic chips to plug the gap left by stalled Nvidia sales. The country has also reportedly been asking local firms to avoid Nvidia\u2019s chips, citing security risks.\nChina\u2019s reluctance to buy Nvidia chips could be heightened further following comments from US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said the plan is to make China addicted to American tech.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nOn the flip side, Huang argues that enabling American companies to sell AI chips in China helps the US set the standards and win the global race.\nNvidia recently posted a 56% year-on-year rise in quarterly revenue, noting a lack of H20 sales in China and a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory from around $650 million in unrestricted H20 sales.\nHuang commended Blackwell\u2019s performance gains, adding that Blackwell Ultra production \u201cis ramping at full speed.\u201d\nYou might also like\n- We\u2019ve listed the best AI tools and best AI writers\n- Access the world\u2019s most powerful chips with the best cloud computing providers\n- 15% of Nvidia and AMD China chip sales to go to US government - new export licenses subject to \u2018unprecedented\u2019 sales tariff despite \u2018national security problem\u2019\nWith several years\u2019 experience freelancing in tech and automotive circles, Craig\u2019s specific interests lie in technology that is designed to better our lives, including AI and ML, productivity aids, and smart fitness.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in mid-July 2025 were viewed as both \u201cinsulting\u201d and brash by China's government.\nIn a televised interview, Lutnick stated Washington\u2019s strategy was to ensure Chinese developers became \u201caddicted\u201d to the American technology stack.\nRising tensions after controversial remarks\n\u201cWe don\u2019t sell them our best stuff, not our second-best stuff, not even our third-best,\u201d Lutnick had told CNBC.\n\u201cYou want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack, that\u2019s the thinking,\u201d he added.\nThe Chinese considered this remark unnecessarily arrogant, and it is now engineering a move that presents sustained sales headwinds for Nvidia, a company that has long viewed the country as a major market.\nThe H20 chip, developed specifically for China after export controls restricted access to more advanced models, had become a key product for local AI firms.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang visited Beijing recently, and stressed the firm\u2019s commitment to staying competitive in the region.\nStill, with China accounting for at least 15% of Nvidia\u2019s total revenue, any disruption to H20 orders represents a serious challenge.\nWashington and Beijing had previously struck a framework agreement earlier in 2025 allowing H20 sales to resume in China while Beijing restored some rare earth exports.\nThat deal was interpreted as a step toward stabilizing relations. Yet by late July 2025, Chinese regulators such as the Cyberspace Administration of China and the Ministry of Industry and Technology began advising firms to halt new H20 orders.\nThis guidance, framed as a response to Lutnick\u2019s remarks, highlights the fragility of recent progress.\nAlongside the restrictions, Beijing has promoted the use of domestic chips, including those from Huawei.\nHowever, doubts remain about their effectiveness, and DeepSeek had to delay the launch of its new R2 model after difficulties training with Huawei Ascend processors.\nChinese tech giants like Alibaba, Baidu, and ByteDance have also been reluctant to fully switch, citing stronger performance from Nvidia hardware compared with local alternatives.\nThe episode illustrates how political statements can rapidly alter corporate fortunes, especially when national security and technology leadership are at stake.\nWhile Nvidia has disputed claims of security risks tied to its products, Beijing\u2019s regulators appear determined to limit reliance on US-made chips.\nWhether Chinese firms can scale up to fill the gap remains uncertain, but what is clear is that Lutnick\u2019s words have accelerated a process of decoupling that may unfold far quicker than industry analysts initially expected.\nVia Financial Times\nYou might also like\n- Microsoft restricts access to its cyber early warning systems for some Chinese firms\n- Access powerful chips with the best cloud computing services\n- Fancy an upgrade?
