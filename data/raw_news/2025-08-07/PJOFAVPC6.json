  "description": "Spurred on by Trump, Texas Republicans redrew the boundary lines for U.S. House seats in the state. The new map creates five more GOP-leaning seats.",
  "content": "\u2022 \u201cAs goes Texas, so goes the nation,\" said Texas state Rep. Brian Harrison, a former Trump administration official.\n\u2022 Califoria Gov. Gavin Newsom said a Democratic House majority would be the \"de facto\" end of Trump's second term.\n\nThe future of Donald Trump's presidency may be decided in Texas in the coming weeks.\n\nA nasty fight in the Lone Star State over redrawing U.S. House districts could decide whether Trump is politically neutered after the 2026 midterms.\n\nDemocrats see next year's election as an opportunity to flip the House, cripple Trump's presidency and ensure he's in full lame duck mode during his final two years before the 2028 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump and his allies are determined to prevent that.\n\n\u201cAs goes Texas, so goes the nation and we are in a battle, this is not hyperbole, we are in a battle for the future of the republic, for the future of these United States,\u201d Texas state Rep. Brian Harrison, a former first-term Trump administration official, told USA TODAY, adding: \u201cThe stakes could not be higher.\u201d\n\nLaunching a rare mid-decade redistricting, Texas Republicans have drawn a new map of U.S. House districts that could give the GOP five more seats and help the party maintain control of the narrowly-divided chamber.\n\nIf they succeed, a pliant GOP-led House would allow Trump to continue one of the most aggressive and disruptive agendas in modern presidential history, while a Democratic majority in January 2027 opens the door to Congressional investigations, legislative paralysis \u2212 even a third impeachment.\n\nDemocratic control of the House would be the \"de facto\" end of Trump's presidency, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a recent press conference.\n\nRepublicans argue it would bring chaos, pointing to the impeachments that consumed Washington D.C. during the second half of Trump's first term.\n\nThe GOP's Texas power play has shaken the political landscape 15 months ahead of the midterm election, setting off a redistricting arms race as blue state leaders move to create more Democratic-leaning House seats to counter Texas, and lawmakers in other red states, including Indiana and Missouri, consider joining the fray.\n\nThe tit-for-tat redistricting battle has exploded into one of the most consequential elements of the 2026 midterms, with the potential to decide control of the House well before votes are counted.\n\nRepublicans currently hold a 219-212 majority in the House, with four vacancies. The party in power typically loses seats in the midterms. If the four vacant seats are filled by a member of the same party that vacated them, Democrats need to pick up just three seats to win control.\n\nA Democrat-controlled House could kill any legislation coming out of the White House, launch investigations of the Trump administration on everything from the Epstein files to Trump's deportation tactics, wield subpoena power to compel testimony from administration officials and even impeach the president for a third time.\n\n\"Donald Trump has always been a wannabe dictator,\" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat, told USA TODAY. \"If Democrats take control of the House we\u2019re a stumbling block for him.\"\n\nTrump has seen it before.\n\nDemocrats rode a wave of anti-Trump enthusiasm to win the House in 2018 during his first term and aggressively probed everything from Trump\u2019s tax returns and personal finances to his administration\u2019s family separation policy for detained immigrants and his purported threats to the rule of law.\n\nTrump twice was impeached by the House during his first term after Democrats won a majority, the first time over allegations he pressured Ukraine's president to dig up dirt on political rival Joe Biden and the second for allegedly inciting an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021 when a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe Senate acquitted Trump in both cases. Democrats face a less favorable political map for the upper chamber and are less likely to win control next year.\n\nRepublicans are highlighting the impeachment threat to argue the last two years of Trump\u2019s presidency could be a distraction from issues Americans care about, such as boosting the economy. They hope to give Trump maximum flexibility to continue a controversial agenda that includes mass deportations, overhauling the federal government and new tariffs on foreign goods.\n\n\"We all know that should we lose the House, which I don\u2019t think we would... that the Democrats would do nothing but impeach, impeach, impeach for two straight years,\" Texas GOP Rep. Troy Nehls, a Trump ally, told USA TODAY.\n\nDemocrats say Trump is abusing his power and must be reined in. They point to polls showing aspects of his agenda are unpopular. The Texas redistricting plan is a way for Trump to game the system to circumvent a reckoning at the 2026 ballot box, Democrats say.\n\n\"Let\u2019s be clear why this is happening, this is happening because Donald Trump is trying to avoid accountability,\" Texas Democratic Party Chair Kendall Scudder told USA TODAY.\n\nWhether a few new GOP-leaning seats in Texas would be enough to swing the election is unclear. Many other factors could come into play, especially the economy, University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato told USA TODAY.\n\n\"We\u2019re so far away\" from the election, Sabato said. \"Suppose we have a recession or even a significant slowdown in the economy? Then it probably will be... a sizeable Democratic margin, at least in the House.\"\n\nBut in a close race for the House, any redistricting changes could be decisive.\n\nBoth parties are acting aggressively, portraying the redistricting fight as a battle for the future of the country.\n\nAs Texas Republicans worked to jam through a new House map, Democrats fled the state to prevent a quorum and stall legislative business. The state\u2019s GOP governor and attorney general responded with legal threats.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Newsom is pushing a plan to redraw his state\u2019s House districts to counter Texas.\n\n\"Whatever they are doing will be neutered here in the state of California,\" Newsom said Aug. 4. Trump \"recognizes he\u2019s going to lose in the midterms and we have the opportunity to de facto end the Trump presidency in less than 18 months. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re putting a stake in the ground.\"\n\nOther blue state leaders are contemplating redistricting, and more red states are considering joining Texas to create more conservative-leaning seats.\n\n'Using every day to the hilt'\n\nTrump said Aug. 5 on CNBC that \"we are entitled to five more seats\" in Texas because of his strong performance in the state.\n\nScudder, the Texas Democratic chair, said his party must be willing to play hardball.\n\n\"We are tired of playing by a different set of rules than the ones they play by,\" he said.\n\nSabato said presidents typically understand they have two years to enact their agenda and then \"they shift into a lower gear.\" Trump seems determined to make his second two years as consequential as the first two.\n\n\"Whatever the motivation, he is using every day to the hilt, much to the chagrin of Democrats,\" he said.\n\nWhoever prevails in the redistricting war, Sabato was skeptical that a Democratic-controlled House would be a meaningful check on a MAGA White House.\n\n\"There\u2019s no obstacle that cannot be removed or cut down to size, especially when you've got a president like Trump,\" he said.",

      "text": "New revelations, steady witnesses, Trump tweets: takeaways from the first public hearing on impeachment\nWASHINGTON \u2013\nTwo American diplomats shared key details of President Donald Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine during the first day of public testimony in the impeachment inquiry and stuck to their story that Trump used his office to go after a political rival.\nDemocrats used Wednesday's open hearing to bolster their case for Trump's impeachment while Republicans tried to scuttle the process by dismissing Democrats' claims Trump engaged in a \"quid pro quo\" with Ukraine.\nOver nearly six hours, House Intelligence Committee members peppered Ambassador Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary at the State Department, with questions about Trump's motivations in Ukraine.\nTaylor testified a Trump official said the president \"cares more\" about investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential candidate, and his son Hunter than he did Ukraine policy. And Kent suggested a Ukraine company at the center of the controversy should be investigated. But mostly, the two withstood fiery questioning from both sides, often expanding on what they'd offered in closed-door testimony.\nTrump, meanwhile, claimed not to pay any mind, although he continually tweeted throughout the hearing.\nThe inquiry is based on a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky where Trump discussed military assistance for Ukraine in exchange for a \"favor\" to investigate his political rivals.\nMore: Impeachment hearing: Diplomat says his aide overheard Trump asking about investigations\nThe details: Who are the 15 witnesses in the Trump impeachment inquiry and what have they said?\nHere are key takeaways from Wednesday's hearing:\nThe new revelation\nTaylor told the committee about a phone call between Trump and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, in which the president seemed to indicate he was more interested in having the Bidens investigated than he was in overall U.S. policy toward Ukraine.\nThe details of the July 26 call, relayed to Taylor by an aide who overheard it, was a new revelation that had not come out of the closed-door hearings held in previous weeks.\nIn the conversation, Trump asked Sondland about \"the investigations,\" Taylor told the panel Wednesday.\nThe president was apparently referring to his request to Zelensky to open probes into Joe Biden's son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that was previously under investigation, as well as alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. U.S. intelligence has found no evidence of Ukrainian meddling in 2016.\nTaylor told lawmakers his staffer asked Sondland what the president thought about Ukraine after the phone call, which came a day after Trump's conversation with Zelensky that sparked the impeachment inquiry.\nSondland said that \"President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for\" than the U.S. policies on Ukraine, according to Taylor.\nTrump told reporters the phone call never happened.\nThe witnesses held up despite the GOP grilling\nTaylor and Kent methodically laid out not only their concerns about the president's call and the resulting push by his allies to investigate the Bidens, but also the danger of using Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Guiliani, to pressure a strategic ally for political gain.\nThe taunts came early from Republicans. In his opening statement, California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top GOP lawmaker on the Intelligence Committee, mockingly congratulated them \"for passing the Democrats\u2019 Star Chamber auditions held for the last six weeks in the basement of the Capitol.\"\nLater, Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch Trump defender known for his aggressive questioning, challenged Taylor about his \"clear understanding\" that both U.S. military aid and a meeting With Trump were contingent on Zelensky publicly announcing the investigations.\nJordan said he couldn't understand how Taylor could come to that conclusion when he never heard it firsthand from either Trump or Zelensky, whom he met three times since his appointment as ambassador in mid-June.\n\u201cThree meetings with the president of Ukraine and no linkage,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cYour clear understanding was wrong because it didn\u2019t happen. (And) this is what I can't believe and you're their star witness,\"\n\"I don't consider myself a star witness for anything,\" Taylor responded.\n\"They do,\" Jordan continued.\n\"I'm not here to take one side or the other or to advocate any particular outcome,\" the ambassador said. \"My understanding is only coming from the people that I talk to.\"\nAt one point, both Kent and Taylor were asked whether they were \"Never Trumpers.\" Both responded no.\nKent's Burisma concerns\nIn response to Republican questioning, State Department aide George Kent said the Ukrainian oligarch owner of gas company Burisma should be investigated for paying a bribe to kill a probe into the company.\nThe Ukrainian firm is at the center of the impeachment controversy. Hunter Biden, an attorney, joined the company's board in 2014 until leaving the firm earlier this year.\n\u201cTo summarize, we thought that Mykola Zlochevsky had stolen money,\u201d Kent said of the head of Burisma. \"We thought a prosecutor had taken a bribe to shut the case, those were our main concerns.\"\n\u201cAre you in favor of that matter being fully investigated and prosecuted?\u201d asked Steve Castor, House Intelligence Committee Counsel for the minority.\n\u201cI think since U.S. taxpayer dollars were wasted, I would love to see the Ukrainian prosecutor\u2019s office find out who the corrupt prosecutor was and who took the bribe, and how much was paid, and that\u2019s what I told the deputy prosecutor general in February 2015,\u201d Kent replied.\nRepublicans have claimed investigations into Zlochevsky were ended to benefit Hunter Biden.\nGOP downplays July 25 Trump call\nRepublicans questioned why Hunter Biden was getting a cozy appointment to a Ukrainian energy company that paid him as much as $50,000 per month. They brought up a debunked claim that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. And they accused Democrats of orchestrating an unfair process aimed at impeaching the president regardless of fact.\nWhat they didn't talk about much was the actual contents of the July 25 call that triggered the impeachment inquiry and that critics have called an abuse of power.\nWhen they did, it was to to say that nothing came of the president's alleged pressure.\n\"For the million of Americans viewing today, the two most important facts are the following,\" said Republican Elise Stefanik of New York. \"Number one, Ukraine received the aid. Number two, there was in fact no investigation of the Bidens.\"\nJordan, the Ohio Republican, complained the panel wouldn\u2019t hear testimony from the anonymous whistleblower who reported Trump\u2019s July 25 call to the inspector general, which sparked the House investigation into Ukraine policy.\nJordan said lawmakers and the American public will never get the chance to gauge the whistleblower's credibility, motivation and bias.\n\"We will never get the chance to see the whistleblower raise his right hand, swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth,\" he said. \"More importantly, the American people won't get that chance ... They understand the facts support the president. They understand this process is unfair.\u201d\nBut Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said the committee would welcome testimony from the person who prompted the investigation.\n\u201cPresident Trump is welcome to come in and take a seat,\u201d Welch said to laughter in the hearing room.\nTrump tweeted despite claims he wouldn't watch\nTrump said he wouldn't be watching Wednesday's hearing but that didn't stop him from tweeting his criticism of the proceedings to his millions of followers.\nThe president's strongest weapon against impeachment has been his ability to keep Republican lawmakers in line. And they remain loyal in no small part due to the GOP base's devotion to Trump.\nTrump was making sure his base had his version of the impeachment process with a string of tweets and retweets beginning Tuesday night that continued up to and during Wednesday's hearing.\nBefore the hearing, Trump called it a \"phony showtrial,\" a \"circus,\" a \"fraudulent hoax conspiracy theory,\" and \"another Witch Hunt.\" He retweeted conservative allies who have called the inquiry \"a partisan sham\" and said Democrats have \"stacked the deck\" against him.\nAt various times during the nearly six-hour hearing went on, the president retweeted his allies, some of whom mocked the \"star witness\" term Jordan had conferred on Taylor.\nTrump also tweeted out an 83-second video halfway through the hearing that came with the following message: \"DEMOCRATS ARE PUTTING POLITICS BEFORE COUNTRY!\"\nContributing: Bart Jansen, Nicholas Wu, Courtney Subramanian"

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 He's making investigations great again \u2014 at least in number.\nAt least 14 Democratic-led House committees have been investigating various aspects of President Donald Trump's businesses, campaign and his presidency since the beginning of this year, an NBC News review shows. In all, those committees have launched at least 50 probes into Trump world.\nThe investigations include whether Trump obstructed justice in the Russia probes, whether his businesses inflated their assets, how his daughter and son-in-law obtained their security clearances, whether he used his power to interfere with mergers, how his actions might have slowed aid to Puerto Rico, and conflict of interest allegations involving cabinet members.\nThe NBC review shows the busiest committees appear to be the Judiciary and Oversight panels. Some of the inquiries might have gone dormant, and some are cross-committee \u2014 meaning they're being investigated jointly by more than one committee \u2014 so they are listed under those committees, but are only counted once in the NBC investigation total.\nHere's a look at the probes that have been made public, organized by committee:\nHOUSE INVESTIGATIONS\nJUDICIARY: Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.\n- Oversight of the administration's family separation policy\n- Former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker\u2019s appointment, his involvement in the Mueller investigation, and his conversations with Trump and involvement with World Patent Marketing\n- Voting rights and Department of Justice actions on voter ID, census cases\n- Easing of sanctions on companies linked to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska\n- Trump's national emergency declaration\n- The president's \"threats to the rule of law,\" covering three main areas:\n- Obstruction of justice, including the possibility of interference by Trump and others in a number of criminal investigations and other official proceedings, as well as the alleged cover-up of violations of the law;\n- Public corruption, including potential violations of the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, conspiracy to violate federal campaign and financial reporting laws, and other criminal misuses of official positions for personal gain;\n- Abuses of power, including attacks on the press, the judiciary, and law enforcement agencies;

      "text": "JD Vance to visit Indiana amid push for redistricting. Will Braun call special session?\nVice President JD Vance is visiting Indianapolis on Aug. 7 to speak with Gov. Mike Braun and Republican legislative leaders about the possibility of redistricting the state's congressional districts amid the Trump administration's push to increase the GOP majority in the House.\nVance plans to meet with Braun, House Speaker Todd Huston of Fishers and Senate Pro Tempore Rodric Bray of Martinsville. The group expects to discuss several topics, Braun said, but any discussion about redistricting would be \"exploratory\" and no commitments have been made at this point.\nBut Braun didn't rule out calling a special session to redraw the Hoosier State\u2019s congressional districts in an attempt to squeeze in another Republican seat ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\"I'm going to listen and see where they're coming from,\" Braun told reporters at the Statehouse. \"And again, I'm going to be listening along with the other two leaders in the legislature and everybody's going to probably have a little different point of view.\"\nRepublicans already hold seven of Indiana\u2019s nine U.S. House seats, but Braun\u2019s comments come as the Trump administration has encouraged other states to take up mid-decade redistricting to help maintain a GOP majority in the House after next year\u2019s elections. Punchbowl News reported that the White House has been exploring the possibility of also encouraging state leaders to redistrict in Indiana.\nThe redistricting process is already underway in Republican-led Texas where new congressional maps would give the GOP in that state five additional U.S. House seats. The effort resulted in Texas Democrats fleeing to Illinois on Aug. 3 to disrupt legislative procedures.\nIndiana Democrats quickly condemned the idea of a special session to draw new congressional maps. Karen Tallian, the Indiana Democratic Party chairwoman, in a statement said any redistricting in the Hoosier State shows Republicans are \"afraid of the voters.\"\n\"Sending the Vice President here to beg for another congressional seat is beyond absurd,\" Tallian said. \"Hoosiers need to stand up against this blatant undermining of democracy.\"\nState Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, told reporters that the redistricting push is a sign of Trump's \"sinking\" popularity.\n\"President Trump and Vice President Vance are so desperate they're scraping for every seat they can get through gerrymandering,\" Pierce said. \"You have to be pretty desperate to decide having seven of the nine seats in Indiana held by Republicans is not enough.\"\nBut Pierce also noted that Statehouse Democrats would not have the same ability to break quorum during a special session that Texas Democrats took over the weekend by fleeing to Illinois. Democrats are in the superminority in both chambers at the Statehouse with 30 seats in the House and 10 seats in the Senate.\n\"We do not yet have enough seats to be able to do that, and maybe that's something the voters will keep in mind when they decide who they're going to support in the upcoming election,\" he said.\nWhat would it take to redistrict in Indiana?\nBraun would have to call a special session for the Indiana General Assembly if Republicans decide they want to redraw Hoosier congressional maps.\nHuston and Bray, both Republicans, have not responded to IndyStar questions through spokespeople about whether President Donald Trump has contacted them or if they have an appetite to draft new maps.\nRepublicans have a supermajority, so new maps could be approved by the legislature despite resistance from Democrats.\nIt\u2019s likely U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan\u2019s 1st District seat in Northwest Indiana would be a signature focus of any redistricting efforts at the Statehouse, although some national outlets have reported longtime Indianapolis U.S. Rep. Andre Carson\u2019s 7th District seat could be targeted as well.\nNational Republicans have targeted Mrvan\u2019s seat as a flip opportunity for the last two election cycles and are poised to again in 2026, especially as Northwest Indiana\u2019s rust belt communities have voted more Republican over the years.\n\u201cI think this seat is one that belongs in the Republican column,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson told IndyStar in 2024.\nBut Mrvan has still defeated his Republican challengers, winning reelection in 2022 by nearly six percentage points and in 2024 by eight percentage points. A press contact for Mrvan's office did not immediately respond to questions from IndyStar.\nWhen did Indiana last go through redistricting?\nState lawmakers last went through redistricting in 2021 following the 2020 U.S. Census when they made changes to both Statehouse and congressional maps. At that time, Republicans left Mrvan\u2019s seat alone.\nInstead, they further cemented GOP grip on the 5th Congressional District after now-U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz defeated Democrat Christina Hale by four points in a nationally-watched race in 2020. Since then, Spartz has won general election contests in 2022 and 2024 by double-digit percentage points over her Democratic opponents.\nThe 2021 congressional maps also adjusted the boundaries of the 6th Congressional District, now represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Jefferson Shreve, to include the southern portion of Indianapolis.\nSome Republicans at the time criticized the move as potentially minimizing the voices of more rural communities in that district.\nContact IndyStar state government and politics reporter Brittany Carloni at brittany.carloni@indystar.com.\nSign up for our free weekly politics newsletter, Checks & Balances, curated by IndyStar politics and government reporters."

      "text": "Trump's first month was full of easy wins. Can he keep up the controlled chaos?\nWASHINGTON \u2013 It's like clockwork: Most weekday afternoons, whether he\u2019s due to speak to the press or not, President Donald Trump summons reporters. The Trump Hour is about to begin.\nSince returning to office Jan. 20, Trump has used lengthy televised gab sessions \u2212 packaged as executive order signings \u2212 to make himself ubiquitous to Americans, shooting from the hip on question after question and dominating the news.\nThe flood of orders, and the verbal provocations that accompany them, are part of an early strategy to overwhelm the system with aggressive policy changes and command the national conversation through brute administrative force, Trump allies and insiders say.\n\u201cThey're talking a lot about what they're doing. And talking about it again, and again, and again,\u201d said Bradley Rateike, a former Trump White House aide. \u201cThey see that as a real tool to remind the American people of why they put them there.\u201d\nTrump has sought to fire thousands of federal workers, dismantle independent agencies, end birthright citizenship and impose tariffs on countries that have a trade deficit with the U.S. or have aggrieved him in some other way.\nThe result has been one of the most head-spinning, boundary-pushing and politically polarizing opening stretches of a presidency in modern history. And a second wave of action is expected soon.\nTrump has quickly laid the groundwork for a consolidation of power through mass firings and the use of executive orders that dictate his funding priorities to Congress. And he's just getting started.\n\u201cThere are more executive orders that have been researched,\u201d said Ken Blackwell, a close White House ally at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute. \u201cI think you'll be surprised that that pace might not slow down to a screeching halt, or a snail's pace, because there are stacks of more executive orders that have been thought out.\u201d\nReady for power\nIt\u2019s an approach that has been refined from Trump\u2019s first term, when he arrived in Washington as a political novice.\nEight years ago, Trump filled out his team with Bush-era appointees and Republican staffers, not all of whom were hard-core MAGA. Leaks abounded as rival aides tried to undercut one another.\nTrump took some big swings, putting controversial travel restrictions on Muslim-majority countries that had to be rewritten after they were blocked in court. And it took his team until the end of his first year in office to get its first major legislative win: the 2017 tax cuts.\nNot this time, allies of the president say.\nSome improvisation\n\u201cThey have a clear, general sense of where they're going,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said. \u201cThey are intuitively moving forward and then modifying things as they figure out what works and what doesn't.\u201d\nThe change in approach has played out most vividly through the aggressive push by the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, to cut the size of federal agencies and shutter some of them.\nDOGE\u2019s efforts to slash the federal workforce and take over sensitive databases holding the personal information of hundreds of millions of Americans is unprecedented and has led to court cases claiming Trump is usurping the constitutional spending power of Congress.\nTrump's early effort to go around Congress and neutralize other checks on his power, such as firing 17 independent inspectors general at government agencies, also have generated lawsuits and outcry.\nSoft approval ratings\n\"In the first month, Donald Trump has waged a scorched-earth campaign against the rule of law,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a floor speech this week.\nDespite the blowback, the president\u2019s approval ratings have remained in the mid-40s \u2212 15 points below Gallup's historical average for U.S. presidents since 1953 but five points higher than Trump's first term.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Trump has taken \"historic action\" in his first month and \"has already accomplished more than most presidents do in their entire term.\"\nNext up: 'A struggle'\nWhat comes next could be more difficult, though, as Trump works to make good on pledges to resolve international crises and fallout from the DOGE cutting spree spreads to Republican congressional districts.\nRepublicans also face hurdles in Congress, including passing a government funding bill by March 14 and turning Trump\u2019s agenda into law with a narrow GOP majority.\n\u201cEverything is going to be a struggle,\u201d said Paul Teller, a longtime Hill staffer and former legislative adviser to Trump.\nSecond time around\nWhere President Joe Biden responded to national exhaustion with Trump after the Republican\u2019s first term by staying off Americans\u2019 screens and out of their lives as much as possible, Trump has ingrained himself in the national culture.\nHe has surrounded himself with trusted allies who better understand the government than many early hires in his first term.\nConservative groups AFPI and The Heritage Foundation spent months crafting blueprints for a second Trump administration. Heritage spearheaded the Project 2025 proposal that was heavily criticized during the campaign and was disavowed by Trump. He has since implemented many of the ideas in the report and hired back aides such as budget director Russell Vought who were involved with crafting it.\nAFPI was home to senior Trump officials such as Linda McMahon, Brooke Rollins, Paula White and Keith Kellogg, who also have returned to Trump\u2019s orbit.\n\u201cIn many ways, they\u2019ve telegraphed the road map,\u201d said Rateike, who worked on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and transition.\nGingrich said the conservative groups \u201ccreated a whole wave of capabilities so they can really enter in an aggressive way \u2212 and they\u2019ve taken advantage of it.\u201d\nDOGE has rocked the federal workforce with buyout offers, mass terminations of thousands of probationary employees, and moves to shutter whole agencies. It has raised concerns about data security and privacy along the way.\nFor those who think the approach is abrasive, Musk told reporters in the Oval Office last week that Trump was doing what he was elected to do.\n\"The people voted for major government reform, and that's what people are going to get,\" Musk said.\nRepublican criticism of Trump's moves has been largely muted, even as DOGE made a slew of error-filled personnel moves that had to be walked back, including firing nuclear safety workers and those working to combat bird flu.\n\u201cIf you take on the lobbyist bureaucrat system slowly, they'll just surround you and envelop you,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cSo Trump has relied on a sledgehammer effect.\u201d\nOpponents have argued the DOGE errors show an administration more concerned about sending a message than making smart reforms.\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy also shrugged off some of the early stumbles, arguing that Musk and DOGE are committed to quickly correcting mistakes. McCarthy said he believes the broader push to rein in government spending is popular enough that voters are willing to accept mistakes.\n\u201cIf Elon would stop every time he sent a rocket up and it had a little problem, we wouldn\u2019t be in the position we are today. We wouldn\u2019t be at the forefront,\u201d McCarthy said of the SpaceX and Tesla CEO.\nTesting the limits of power\nTrump\u2019s penchant for testing the limits of his power has extended to an array of other moves, from proposing to acquire Greenland, Canada, the Gaza Strip and the Panama Canal to his Justice Department dropping corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams so he can help Trump\u2019s immigration agenda.\nThe Adams decision led to a top New York federal prosecutor, who was promoted by Trump and had sterling conservative credentials, to resign along with others in New York and Washington.\nTrump has been able to change the conversation around international issues such as Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the Gaza conflict through statements assailing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and jaw-dropping propositions like one suggesting the U.S. should take control of Gaza.\nBut the made-for-TV strategy can take Trump only so far.\nHigh-level officials such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff were in Saudi Arabia this week to launch negotiations with Russia to end the war. But they'll need Ukraine's sign-off to get an agreement.\n\u201cThese are very hard issues he's grabbed. It will only get harder, because then it'll be time to implement, and we have to get the rest of the folks in place that will do that,\u201d said Victoria Coates, a former Trump deputy national security adviser who's now at the Heritage Foundation.\nGetting legislation through Congress is another big test and a tougher challenge than Trump has faced so far. Republicans have just a three-vote majority in the House, and lawmakers in the upper and lower chamber have not been able to agree on an approach to passing legislation that formalizes Trump's agenda.\nAnd Congress can't be forced into action at the stroke of a president's pen.\n\u201cCongress has a tight, tight majority, so it's never easy,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cBut he's never been stronger. I think that makes all the difference.\u201d"

      "text": "Trump says Republicans are 'entitled' to more congressional seats in Texas\nPresident Donald Trump defended Republican efforts to redraw Texas' congressional maps that would add five GOP seats, saying Democratic-leaning states have also used gerrymandering to tilt the scales in their party's favor.\nRepublicans hold a narrow 220-212 majority in the House of Representatives and the president's political operatives are fearing a blue wave in next year's midterms, which could hamper his final two years in office if Democrats take control.\n\"We have an opportunity in Texas to pick up five seats, we have a really good governor and we have good people in Texas, and I won Texas... and we are entitled to five more seats,\" Trump said during an Aug. 5 appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box.\nThe plan has ignited a nasty and partisan tug-of-war with Democratic governors in Illinois, New York and California pledging to return the favor and redraw their congressional maps to add more Democratic districts.\nTrump called out Texas Democrats for fleeing to liberal states, saying those places have been using the same tactics when crafting their congressional districts.\n\"Do you notice they go to Illinois for safety, but that's all gerrymandered,\" he said. \"California is gerrymandered. We should have many more seats in Congress. It's all gerrymandered.\"\nStates are required by law to draw up with new boundaries for Congress every decade based on the U.S. Census to reflect population changes, but occasionally legislatures step in earlier. Some states, such as California, have empowered independent commissions to draft their congressional maps, but Gov.

(Greg) Abbott for one simple reason: to rig the 2026 elections,\" Newsom said at a July 25 press conference joined by Texas Democrats. \"California's moral high ground means nothing if we\u2019re powerless because of it.\"\nTrump explained his rationale for the mid-decade maneuver, arguing that his margin of victory in the Lone Star State justifies changing the maps. The president noted how all nine of Massachusetts' congressional delegation are made up of Democrats even though he won roughly 36% of the vote last year.\n\"We should have a couple of Congress people, but we have none,\" Trump said.\nThis story will be updated."

      "text": "'We are at war.' Texas redistricting plan sparks wider fight over Congress, Trump legacy\nThe Trump-inspired plan aimed at redrawing Texas' congressional maps has thrust the nation into a gerrymander war with massive implications\nTexas has ripped open a nasty fight in its legislative halls of power that could determine who controls the U.S. Congress and the fate of President Donald Trump's final two years in office.\nRepublican legislators in Austin have redrawn the Lone Star State's congressional maps after pressure from the president's political operatives, who are nervous that Democrats might win control of the House \u2013 as is customary for the party out of power \u2013 in 2026.\nThe new maps, advanced by a Texas legislative committee on Aug. 2, create five new GOP-leaning districts and target Democratic incumbents, which would give Republicans in Congress more cushion to defend their slim House majority in other states ahead of the midterm elections.\nTexas Democrats have left the state in an attempt to sabotage the Republican plan, which has a 30-day time limit in the special session that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott convened on July 25.\n\"Gerrymandering can be done, or drawing lines, can be done on the basis of political makeup, as in Republicans versus Democrats, and there\u2019s nothing illegal about that,\" Abbott said in an Aug. 4 interview with Fox News.\n\"All of these districts that are being added are districts that were won by Trump.\"\nVoting rights advocates argue these changes, however, will suppress Black and Hispanic voters in a move that has set off a partisan tug-of-war, which carries significant ramifications for the Trump administration and the Democrats.\nRepublicans are fearful Trump will be impeached for a third time should Democrats win back the House, and progressives have equally fretted that the president and his allies are looking to tilt the election scales and lock them out of power for the foreseeable future as the administration continues to bulldoze its agenda through despite resistance.\nStepping into that leadership void are Democratic governors, some with presidential aspirations, who are pledging to counter Texas by creating maps in large blue states that would offset GOP gains by targeting Republican members of Congress.\nHere are the key takeaways from the Texas redistricting standoff.\nEscape from Texas: Democrats have fled to block GOP-favored maps\nStates are required to come up with new lines every decade based on the U.S. Census, but when legislatures have the power, they occasionally step in to make new maps before the decade ends.\nSuch is the case in Texas, where in the statehouse Republicans hold 88 out of 150 seats, leaving the 62-member Democratic caucus with very few options to stop the new congressional districts from taking effect.\nThat means they're taking drastic measures. And the first step is depriving Texas Republicans of a needed 100-member quorum to proceed with a vote by leaving the state and forcing the legislature's ongoing special session to a halt.\n\"This is not a decision we make lightly, but it is one we make with absolute moral clarity,\" state Rep. Gene Wu, who is chair of the Texas House Democratic Caucus, said in a statement.\nThe move also jeopardizes other issues on the special session's menu, such as addressing funding for flood prevention in the wake of the deadly July 4 flash flooding that killed more than 130 people along the Guadalupe River.\nUnder the new maps, Texas' congressional districts in the Houston, Austin and Dallas metro areas would be sliced up, along with a handful in southern Texas, creating five additional districts that would have heavily favored Trump in last year's presidential race.\n\"They're turning our districts into crazy shapes to guarantee the outcome they want in the 2026 elections,\" Rep. James Talarico said in an Aug. 3 video posted on X. \"If this power grab succeeds, they will hang onto power without any accountability from the voters.\"\nAbbott threatens expulsion and even felony charges against Dems\nAbbott has defended the mid-cycle redistricting effort as necessary after receiving a July 7 letter from the Justice Department that cites \"constitutional concerns\" about the existing congressional boundaries.\nHe is now threatening the lawmakers who've left town with expulsion if they do not return by Aug. 4, arguing the Democrats' \"deliberate plan not to show up for work\" amounts to forfeiting their elected office.\nThe governor also alluded to criminal charges, suggesting the lawmakers who abandoned ship may \"also have committed felonies.\"\n\"It seems to me that the only way some of the fleeing Democrats can avoid bribery charges is to not break quorum,\" Abbott said in an Aug. 3 post on X. \"It seems that would eliminate any potential quid pro quo connected to any payment they received to deny a quorum and skip a vote.\"\nOther conservative leaders in the state, such as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who was impeached by the Texas House on bribery charges in 2023, used sharper language. He said absconding legislators will be \"found, arrested, and brought back\" to the state.\n\"We should use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law,\" Paxton said.\nUnder Texas House rules, the legislature can issue civil arrest warrants and have the Sergeant at Arms force a member's attendance in a state that would cooperate.\nMembers who don't show up also face a $500-a-day fine, and Texas Democrats began fundraising last month to cover those costs. But breaking quorum isn't against the law, which means federal agencies do not have the authority to bring those lawmakers back by force.\n'Gloves are off' Democratic governors provide haven, hatch own map plans\nSeveral Texas Democrats left for bluer pastures, such as Illinois and New York, where governors have indicated that they'd pursue creating new maps that favor their party should the Trump-inspired plan move ahead.\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul held an Aug. 4 press conference during which she discussed the possibility of new maps and delivered a stark message about how Democrats view this fight.\n\"This is a war. We are at war,\" she said. \"And that's why the gloves are off and I say, 'Bring it on.'\"\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, joined Texas Democratic lawmakers at their press conference this past weekend. He has reportedly helped them find lodging and other accommodations, saying \"everything is on the table,\" and that includes the Prairie State coming up with new maps, too.\n\"Trump came up with a new scheme to rig the system by ramming through a corrupt, mid-decade redistricting plan that would steal five congressional seats, silencing millions of voters, especially Black and Latino voters,\" Pritzker said.\nThe same goes for California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom, another possible White House contender, cast the clash as a fight for democracy. He has proposed temporarily setting aside his state's independent redistricting commission.\nDemocrats dominate the Golden State, holding 43 out of 52 congressional seats.\nNewsom indicated the president would reap what he sowed if he continued this fight.\n\"Buckle up, Donald Trump. California is about to get a whole lot bluer, thanks to you,\" Newsom said in an Aug. 1 post on X.\nTrump's remaining time in power at stake\nDemocrats have an opening to take back the House of Representatives, where the GOP holds a narrow 220-212 majority, and the 2026 midterms will determine how Trump's presidency ends \u2013 including how he tries to spend money, any laws he wants to try to pass and, importantly, whether he faces a third round of impeachment proceedings.\nNext year's mid-term elections are expected to be tight contests across the board, particularly with Republicans having to defend Trump's agenda, which includes tax cuts and Medicaid reforms.\nIf Democrats can win a majority in one chamber of Congress, they would be in a position to block Trump's remaining legislative priorities, which would significantly hamper his power for the rest of his term. It would also give them subpoena authority in powerful committees, which would force the administration and other witnesses to testify and hand over key documents.\nAfter the 2018 midterms during Trump's first term in office, the president and his goals were put on their heels and he saw a series of investigations against him, his administration and his allies.\n\"Republicans are afraid to face voters in a free and fair election,\" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, the House minority leader, said in an Aug. 3 post on X responding to the Texas attorney general.\n\"That\u2019s the reason the extremists want to gerrymander the Texas congressional map and steal five seats. Look in the mirror and you\u2019ll see the face of a coward.\"\nRepublicans aren't stopping with Texas\nWhatever happens in Texas, the fight over Congress via redistricting will continue in Ohio later this month, where Republicans hold a supermajority in the state legislature.\nGOP operatives believe they can pick up a couple of seats in the Buckeye State, which has a congressional delegation made up of 10 Republicans and 5 Democrats. Trump won the state by 11% last year.\nSen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, has already telegraphed that the plan is to create at least two GOP-leaning districts, likely targeting Democratic Reps. Marcy Kaptur and Emilia Sykes, who represent Toledo and Akron, respectively.\nUnder the Ohio process, each chamber must have three-fifths of its members agree on the new maps. If the legislature can't reach a consensus, then the Ohio Redistricting Commission (which is controlled mostly by Republicans) takes over, but would return the matter to legislators if they can't come up with a plan within a month."

      "text": "Trump administration won't release the Epstein files, but what would they contain?\nUSA TODAY spoke to former FBI agents and prosecutors to understand what the so-called \"Epstein files\" might contain, and the arguments for and against releasing them.\nThe White House has continued to resist calls from Congress and President Donald Trump's own base to release the FBI's investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein. Instead, it has asked courts to release grand jury testimony and has interviewed convicted Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell to try to satisfy demands for transparency.\nSo far, those alternatives haven't satisfied conservatives who believe \u2212 as Trump allies suggested for years \u2212 that Epstein was involved in a sex trafficking conspiracy with many other rich and powerful people. Top Trump officials came into office promising a new level of transparency in the Epstein case, and many Trump supporters maintain the administration should release all of the files it has.\nBut what exactly is in those sought-after files? What would the public learn from their release? To answer those questions, USA TODAY talked to former FBI agents and prosecutors. They said the files are likely to be much more expansive than what's in the grand jury testimony, including records on witness interviews and investigative trails.\n\"It could be an enormous universe of original documents, interview notes, memos of analysis,\" said Michell Epner, a former New Jersey federal prosecutor who handled sex trafficking cases.\nReps. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, and Lauren Boebert, R-Colorado, cosponsored legislation in mid-July to release the government's Epstein records, with redactions to protect victims, active investigations and the national defense. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, announced July 22 that he was shutting down the House early for its summer recess to avoid a vote on releasing the Epstein files.\nHere's a look at what sorts of material the government is keeping hidden and the arguments for and against transparency:\nWhat could be in the FBI's 'Epstein files'?\nThe FBI's investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, who died in a Manhattan federal jail cell in 2019 while awaiting a federal sex trafficking trial, goes back decades, and could include a wide swath of material.\nAround 2006, federal investigators looked into allegations that Epstein was paying several minor girls to perform sex acts with him. That inquiry led to what many regard as a sweetheart deal for Epstein, in which he pleaded guilty in 2008 to two Florida state prostitution charges, avoided a sex trafficking charge, and served just 13 months in a local jail.\nThe case related to criminal activities in Epstein's Palm Beach mansion, which was about 2 miles away from Trump's Mar-a-Lago club. The federal prosecutor who negotiated the deal, Alex Acosta, became the labor secretary in Trump's first administration but resigned after fallout from a 2018 Miami Herald investigation that revealed Acosta's role in the deal.\nIn July 2019, the convicted sex offender was arrested on the more serious charge of sex trafficking a minor. That same day, the FBI raided Epstein's Manhattan mansion, collecting computer hard drives and other potential evidence. After Epstein died, law enforcement also raided his property in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nThose investigations would have produced a range of materials and documents, according to former law enforcement officials. It would include records of various witness interviews and details that could span well beyond information that was relevant to the criminal charges brought against Epstein and Maxwell.\n\"People volunteer whatever they want and and sometimes people are very vocal, and they tell you personal things that have nothing to do with the investigation,\" said Katherine Schweit, a former FBI special agent and former Illinois state prosecutor.\nThat could mean the files contain information or allegations dealing with third parties who have never been charged with a crime.\nIn a news release in February, the Justice Department said it planned to release \"thousands of pages\" of never-before-disclosed documents after reviewing and redacting them to protect the identities of Epstein\u2019s victims.\nIn a memo in July, however, the department reversed course and said no further disclosure was warranted.\nTrump was reportedly told in May that he is named multiple time in the files. Trump and Epstein were friends for many years, living near each other and partying together as far back as the early 1990s. Archived video footage and photos revealed by CNN July 22 show Epstein attending Trump's wedding to his second wife, Marla Maples, at the Plaza Hotel in 1993.\nThe two men's friendship ended in about 2004, around the time they battled over an oceanfront Palm Beach mansion, according to The Washington Post. Trump recently said he banned Epstein from his Florida Mar-a-Lago club because Epstein \"stole\" staffers from the spa, including Virginia Giuffre, a well-known victim of Epstein who died by suicide earlier this year.\nWill grand jury transcripts cover the Epstein files?\nThe grand jury transcripts requested by the Justice Department probably amount to just a sliver of what the FBI has in its possession, Epner said.\n\"Grand jury testimony \u2013 while it could be, in theory, very broad \u2013 in this case, is very narrow,\" Epner said.\nA federal judge in Florida already rejected the Justice Department's request for the release of grand jury transcripts from around 2006. Two separate requests for the grand jury transcripts that led to charges against Epstein and Maxwell in New York more than a decade later are still pending.\nEpner explained that grand jury materials are just a subset of the work product the FBI and DOJ likely put together in the course of their Epstein-related investigations. And the Justice Department isn't even seeking all grand jury materials \u2013 only the grand jury transcripts. That wouldn't include, for instance, bank records obtained through a grand jury subpoena.\nTheoretically, a list of grand jury witnesses can be long. Prosecutors may call many witnesses before a grand jury so they can be confident of what the witnesses will say under oath at trial. Some grand juries also conduct investigations and call a wide range of witnesses for that purpose.\nBut that's not what happened in Maxwell and Epstein's New York criminal cases. Only two witnesses testified before the grand juries, according to the Justice Department. They were an FBI agent and a New York police detective who, at the time, was working with the FBI's Child Exploitation and Human Trafficking Task Force. Those witnesses summarized what interview subjects said.\nThat means the transcripts wouldn't include direct testimony from victims. It also suggests the grand jury processes in the two cases were streamlined rather than sprawling.\nIn addition, if the Manhattan federal court agrees to release the transcripts, the Justice Department has said it plans to redact not just victim-related information, but also \"other personal identifying information.\" That may mean blocking out identifiers for third parties tied to Epstein \u2013 the type of people whom members of the public may want to investigate as potential clients of Epstein.\n\"I don't think the people that are behind all this, people that are have so much of an outcry about this, that they're going to be satisfied with just grand jury information, unless they don't know what it is,\" said Rick Smith, a former FBI special agent who now provides investigative services to law firms.\nThat doesn't mean the grand jury transcripts couldn't contain revelations. Schweit noted that court rules that restrict testimony at trial are relaxed before grand juries, so the jurors who charged Maxwell and Epstein may have heard things that weren't discussed at Maxwell's public trial in 2021.\n\"You might include in a grand jury somebody's criminal background, or ask questions about where they went to college and who their roommates were, and did they know this person or that person? Some things that in a regular court might be hearsay, it might be secondary information,\" Schweit said.\nWhy not release the files?\nThere are arguments against releasing the files. The Justice Department has said its review of the files didn't produce evidence to justify investigating anyone who hasn't been charged already. Assuming that was a fair assessment of the evidence, releasing the files could unfairly tie third parties to Epstein's suspected crimes.\n\"The thing that happens with something like this is there are a lot of people out there that are scared to death of this thing, who had nothing to do with anything untoward,\" Smith said.\nTrump isn't the only famous person who has been tied to Epstein in ways that fueled speculation \u2013 without proof \u2013 of Epstein-related criminal conduct. Former President Bill Clinton flew repeatedly on Epstein's private jet, according to flight logs reported on by The Palm Beach Post. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak met with Epstein dozens of times and also took flights on the jet, according to a Wall Street Journal investigation. Others may simply have been present at one of the many glamorous parties Epstein attended in his social heyday.\nIf the Justice Department one day finds new evidence and concludes investigating someone else is appropriate, releasing the evidence it has could jeopardize that investigation. There is no statute of limitations that would restrict federal prosecutors from going after someone else for suspected sex trafficking.\n\"We want to ensure that we can continue to truthfully look for whether somebody is guilty or innocent, whether further investigation needs to be done,\" Schweit said.\nStill, releasing the files also could clear people who have come under suspicion in some corners of the court of public opinion. Actor Kevin Spacey, who \u2013 according to Law & Crime \u2013 acknowledged in court testimony flying on Epstein's plane along with Clinton, wants the files released so he can clear his name.\n\"Release the Epstein files. All of them,\" Spacey, 65, posted on X July 15. \"For those of us with nothing to fear, the truth can't come soon enough. I hate to make this about me \u2013 but the media already has.\"\nAnd part of what makes the Epstein-related investigations different is the level and spread of conspiracy theories surrounding how Epstein died and who may have also been involved in his crimes. Several members of Trump's own administration fanned the flames of those conspiracy theories for years.\nNow, those same officials are facing a wide segment of the public that doesn't trust that all investigative leads have been followed.\n\"If there wasn't so much of an outcry that there was a conspiracy, I don't think we'd be where we are right now,\" Smith said. \"But now that the people that had the most say about it are in the position to do something about it, it becomes a problem.\""

      "text": "President Trump orders ICE to expand deportations in large Democrat-run cities\nThe order came after Trump promised to protect migrant farmers, hotel workers, and others in the leisure industry who have been among those deported.\nWASHINGTON \u2212 President Donald Trump directed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to ramp up efforts to detain and deport migrants from large Democratic-run cities, escalating his crackdown on illegal immigration despite widespread protests against the policy.\nTrump called for an expanded deportation blitz in a post late June 15 on Truth Social, challenging ICE officers to \"do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.\"\nHis order came after large protests in response to ICE raids erupted in Los Angeles last week, prompting him to deploy the National Guard and Marines to quell rioters, and in cities across the country during the \"No Kings\" rallies June 14.\nTrump said that to achieve his deportation goals, \"we must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America\u2019s largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside.\"\n\"These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center, where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens,\" he said.\nTrump said he wants ICE officers to focus on \"our crime ridden and deadly Inner Cities, and those places where Sanctuary Cities play such a big role,\" adding that: \"You don\u2019t hear about Sanctuary Cities in our Heartland!\"\n\"Now go, GET THE JOB DONE!\" Trump added.\nTrump sent a much different signal about his deportation aims last week when he promised future policy changes to protect migrant farmers, hotel workers and others in the leisure industry who have been among those deported. Trump cited hearing from people in the farm and leisure industries concerned about worker shortages because of mass deportations.\n\"Our farmers are being hurt badly,\" Trump said June 12. \"You know, they have very good workers. They've worked for them for 20 years. They're not citizens, but they've turned out to be, you know, great.\"\nEven before Trump's latest charge to ICE, the agency had dramatically expanded its deportation operations after the White House demanded the agency increase its arrests of migrants in the country illegally, Reuters reported. Daily quotas increased from 1,000 arrests a day to 3,000.\nTrump's border czar, Tom Homan, said in late May that the administration had deported about 200,000 people over four months \u2012 a total that lags behind the deportations during a similar period under former President Joe Biden. The White House has said the discrepancy is the result of fewer migrants coming to the border.\nMigrants seeking to cross the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped significantly during Trump's first five months of his second term. Border Patrol agents have seen their monthly encounters of migrants and asylum seekers drop to fewer than 10,000, down from more than 100,000 one year ago.\nWhat the Trump administration means for your identity: Sign up for USA TODAY's This is America newsletter.\nContributing: Reuters\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

      "text": "5 takeaways as the House impeaches Trump for second time\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to impeach President Donald Trump for the second time, a move that drew support from a handful of Republicans who agreed that Trump incited violence at the Capitol last week.\nTrump was impeached on an insurrection charge after 232 members of Congress voted for it and 197 voted against.\nThe article of impeachment was debated one week after a deadly riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, the day Congress counted the Electoral College votes for President-elect Joe Biden's win. The rampage that interrupted the count left one police officer dead, a rioter fatally shot and three others dead from medical emergencies.\nThe article of impeachment charges the president with \"incitement of insurrection\" for \"spreading false statements\" about the election and challenging the Electoral College results.\nRead USA TODAY's live coverage: House votes to impeach Trump on insurrection charge\nHere are the top takeaways from Wednesday's impeachment proceedings:\n10 Republicans vote to impeach Trump\nThough Republicans were united in opposing the first impeachment of Trump in 2019, 10 broke ranks Wednesday when they voted alongside Democrats to impeach the president.\nThey included the third-ranking House Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming. She was joined by:\n- Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y.\n- Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich.\n- Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Wash.\n- Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill.\n- Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash.\n- Rep. Peter Meijer, R-Mich.\n- Rep. Tom Rice, R-S.C.\n- Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif.\n- Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, R-Ohio\n\u201cThe President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,\u201d Cheney said in a stark, three-paragraph statement. \u201cEverything that followed was his doing.\"\nCheney's words became a key argument for Democrats as they urged their Republican colleagues to join them in voting for impeachment.\n\u201cThis is not some irresponsible new member of the Congress of the United States. This is the daughter of the former Republican whip and a former vice president of the United States of America,\u201d Majority Leader Steney Hoyer, D-Md., said of his Republican colleague from Wyoming whose father is former Vice President Dick Cheney. \u201cShe knows of what she speaks.\u201d\nCheney's support for impeachment drew condemnation from fellow Republicans such as Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who called for her to step down.\n'Betrayal': GOP support for Trump's impeachment shows major Republican shift after Capitol riot\nCheney said Wednesday she would not give up her position in party leadership.\n\u201cLast week, there was a domestic threat at the door of the Capitol, and he did nothing to stop it. That is why with a heavy heart and clear resolve, I will vote yes on these articles of impeachment,\u201d Newhouse said to applause from the Democratic side of the House.\nNewhouse said that although the article of impeachment is flawed, \u201cthere\u2019s no excuse for President Trump\u2019s actions.\u201d\nFour House Republicans skipped Wednesday's impeachment vote: Reps. Kay Granger of Texas, Andy Harris of Maryland, Greg Murphy of North Carolina and Daniel Webster of Florida. Harris, an anesthesiologist, said in a statement he decided to take care of patients rather than vote. Murphy skipped the vote to take care of his wife, who just went through back surgery. Webster said there were \"family medical obligations.\" A Granger spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\nOther Republicans acknowledge Trump wrongdoing but call impeachment divisive\nThough some Republicans split with their party, the majority opposed impeachment, and many argued that removing Trump from office would further splinter an already divided country. Others said Trump's efforts to question the election results and stoke a violent mob require a response.\nRep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., said Trump gave a fiery speech outside the White House before the crowd rioted in the Capitol, but he shouldn\u2019t be blamed for the \u201clunatic fringe\u201d of his political movement.\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Trump bears some responsibility for the riot, which he called \u201cundemocratic, un-American and criminal,\u201d but \"impeaching the president in such a short time frame would be a mistake.\"\n\"A vote to impeach will further divide the nation. A vote to impeach will further fan the flames of partisan division,\" he said.\nMcCarthy said Trump should have immediately denounced the mob. He said the president should work to quell brewing unrest and ensure a peaceful transition to Biden.\nA censure resolution would be prudent instead of impeachment, McCarthy said. Censuring the president would deliver a formal reprimand to Trump, but Republicans such as Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs are opposed to that measure as well.\nSome House Republicans argued Wednesday that instead of impeaching Trump, Congress should create a commission to study what happened last week. Modeled after the bipartisan commission that analyzed the 9/11 terrorism attacks, the body would recommend how to prevent attacks on the Capitol.\nThe top Republican on the House Rules Committee urged lawmakers not to move forward with a snap impeachment, saying it would deny Trump due process.\n\u201cRather than seeking to heal America, they\u2019re trying to divide us more deeply,\" Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said as the House set up rules for debate on the impeachment resolution.\nDemocrats stress the importance of moving swiftly\nThe last time Trump was impeached, it took months. Democrats said a long inquiry wasn't needed this time.\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who has participated in all four modern impeachment investigations, said there was no need for an extensive review of the facts and evidence required in previous cases.\n\u201cWhat happened this time was in plain view,\u201d Lofgren said. \u201cHe incited a right-wing mob of insurrections to come and overturn constitutional government a week ago. You don\u2019t need a long investigation to find that out.\u201d\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., quoted President Abraham Lincoln, St. Paul from the Bible and President John F. Kennedy in arguing that lawmakers bear a responsibility to remove Trump\u2019s threat to the country. \"He must go,\" she said. \"He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.\"\nAlthough Trump has only days left in his presidency, House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said he poses a continuing threat to the nation, to the integrity of elections and to democratic order.\n\u201cHe must not remain in power one moment longer,\u201d Nadler said.\n\"Is there little time left? Yes,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cBut it is never too late to do the right thing.\"\nTrump becomes first president to be impeached twice\nHouse Democrats impeached Trump in December 2019 on charges that he abused the power of his office and obstructed Congress in his dealings with Ukraine. The Republican-led Senate acquitted him in February 2020.\nHe was accused of pressuring Ukraine's president to investigate Biden and his son Hunter to help Trump win the 2020 election.\nThe Senate vote less than a year ago was far shy of the two-thirds majority needed for conviction. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah was the only Republican to join Democrats in voting to convict on one of the articles.\nTwo other presidents have been impeached \u2013 Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton \u2013 but Trump became the first to be impeached twice. No president has been removed from office.\nWhat comes next?\nThe House's vote to impeach Trump is just the first step on the road to removing him from office, which would require a Senate vote to convict Trump of the charge of insurrection. The Senate probably will not convene for a trial until Trump has left office and Biden is inaugurated Jan. 20.\nThe Senate is on a recess break and is set to reconvene Tuesday \u2013 the day before the inauguration. Democrats hope to immediately move forward on a trial, but the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s office and indicated a trial would not occur until the Senate is back in session, according to Doug Andres, a spokesman for McConnell.\nDemocrats said convicting Trump could ensure he is unable to take office again, preventing him from running for a second term as president in 2024 as he indicated he plans to do.\nDemocrats are reluctant to begin a trial just as Biden's term begins. Pelosi said she's reviewing the timing but hasn't announced a decision on when to transmit the article to the Senate.\nWhile McConnell controls the Senate floor and its schedule, Schumer, D.N.Y., has floated the possibility of invoking a rarely used emergency provision that would force the Senate back in session if both leaders consented. McConnell won't consent, his spokesman said.\nContributing: Bart Jansen, Maureen Groppe, Ledyard King, Nicholas Wu, Christal Hayes and David Jackson"

      "text": "Democrats seize control of House, power to investigate President Trump\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Democrats seized control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections, ending unified Republican rule of Washington and setting the stage for confrontation with President Donald Trump when they take power in January.\nDemocrats are expected to leverage their new majority to wield Congress' oversight powers. They could demand Trump\u2019s tax returns, subpoena his Cabinet members and investigate suspected ties to Russia. And they can block the president\u2019s legislative priorities, whether it\u2019s funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border or curbing entitlement programs.\nDemocrats notched key wins in suburban districts from Virginia to Colorado to Florida, standing as a rebuke to Trump. Although the final party breakdown remained in flux as of Wednesday morning, Democrats were expected to win more than the 23 seats they need to gain control.\nWith 218 seats needed for a majority, Democrats have won 219 and the Republicans 193, with winners undetermined in 23 races.\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill Wednesday that women candidates led the party's charge and that the issue of health care, specifically the requirement that insurers cover those with pre-existing conditions, secured their win.\n\u201cHealth care was on the ballot and health care won,\u201d Pelosi said.\nMore: Money, message and Trump: 6 lessons learned from the most tumultuous midterms in a generation\nMore: President Trump touts 'magic' Senate wins, ignores House losses\nThe new Democratic majority would work to lower the price of prescription drugs, invest in infrastructure and reduce the role of \"dark, special-interest money\" in politics, she said.\nShe promised oversight of the Trump administration but did not commit to investigations, saying that would be the province of committee chairs. However, she specifically noted the committees that would find topics worthy of inquiry, including Judiciary, Intelligence and especially Homeland Security.\nThe country should be \"shamed,\" Pelosi said, about the policy that separated immigrant children from their mothers.\nA leading Democratic antagonist of Trump, Rep. Adam Schiff, is poised to take over the House Intelligence Committee. He told MSNBC Tuesday night that the panel under Republicans had \"completely abdicated\" its oversight of the White House.\nAnother Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Eric Swalwell, outlined hearings he expected to be held.\n\u201cWe'll fill in the gaps on the Russia investigations,\" Swalwell told NBC News. \"The American people will see his tax returns, not because of any voyeuristic interest, but because they should know if he is corrupt. And we will look at the cashing in of access to the Oval Office and that has been concerning, and his financial entanglements overseas.\u201d\nTrump lashed back Wednesday, threatening to investigate Democrats.\nTrump also offered support for Pelosi to regain the House Speaker's gavel, although he may simply prefer her as a liberal foil to attack.\nLater Wednesday, Trump said at a news conference he was sincere in his praise of Pelosi and could work with her on issues like health care.\n\"I give her a great deal of credit for what she's done and what she has accomplished,\" Trump said. \"Hopefully we can all work together to deliver for the American people.\"\nFor defeated Republicans, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a conservative ally of Trump, announced Wednesday his bid to lead the party in the House.\nOutgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan congratulated Democrats for taking the House and Republicans for solidifying their hold on the Senate. He noted the headwinds facing the party in power during midterm election.\n\"We don't need to have an election to know that we are a divided nation, and now we have a divided Washington,\" the Wisconsin Republican said in statement tweeted by his spokeswoman.\nFemale candidates spearheaded Democratic gains. At least 80 women had been elected to the House. Sixty-nine of the House women are Democrats, including 27 of 28 newcomers, according to a USA TODAY analysis.\nIn Virginia, Democrat Jennifer Wexton, a state senator, toppled incumbent GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock. Wexton held a more than 12% lead over Comstock with more than 99% of ballots counted. Comstock, branded \"Trumpstock\" by Wexton in ads, fell short in a well-to-do suburban district that has become increasingly Democratic.\nIn Colorado, incumbent GOP Rep. Mike Coffman lost to Democrat Jason Crow, a lawyer and combat veteran. In Florida, Democrats knocked off incumbent GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo and snagged an open seat held by longtime incumbent GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is retiring.\nIn suburban Philadelphia, Democrat Mary Gay Scanlon was declared the winner in another open seat held by former GOP Rep. Pat Meehan, who resigned amid questions about accusations of misconduct toward a junior female staffer. Scanlon, a former school board member and attorney, also benefited from a court-ordered redistricting decision that made the district significantly more Democratic. She defeated former Republican prosecutor Pearl Kim in November.\nGOP Rep. Pete Sessions, whose district includes the wealthy Dallas suburbs, lost to Colin Allred, a civil rights attorney and former player for the NFL\u2019s Tennessee Titans in Texas\u2019 32nd District. Sessions is chairman of the powerful Rules Committee and led the National Republican Congressional Committee when it made historic gains in 2010. He had not faced a competitive race in years.\nWhile many of the Republicans who were knocked off were centrists, a handful of conservatives in GOP districts once thought to be safe found they would not be returning to Washington next year.\nIn Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District, Democratic former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger scored a major upset, ousting conservative GOP Rep. Dave Brat in a race that was surprisingly competitive for a district that has been reliably red. Brat knows about upsets: In 2014, he defeated then-GOP Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the Republican primary. President Donald Trump carried the district by 7 percentage points in 2016.\nDemocrats gained a seat in Iowa\u2019s 1st Congressional District, a blue-collar swing seat now represented by arch conservative GOP Rep.

Democrat Abby Finkenauer, a 29-year-old state representative, is slated to become the first woman ever elected to the House from Iowa.\nRep. Claudia Tenney fell to Anthony Brindisi, a New York state assemblyman, in New York\u2019s 22nd District.

Minnesota\u2019s 8th District elected Republican Pete Stauber, a retired police commander, former professional hockey player and county commissioner. He beat Democrat Joe Radinovich, who served in the Minnesota House. (In Minnesota, the Democrats are the Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party.)\nTwo indicted Republicans, Californian Duncan Hunter and New York state\u2019s Chris Collins, won their re-election bids.\nHunter and his wife, Margaret, face a 60-count federal indictment alleging conspiracy, wire fraud and misspending and falsification of campaign finance records. Collins is accused of insider trading. Party leaders asked him to withdraw, but he stayed in the race.\nRepublicans fended off stiff challenges in some more conservative districts. In Kentucky, GOP Rep. Andy Barr defeated Democrat and former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath. The district, which includes Lexington and Frankfurt, shouldn\u2019t have been competitive: Trump won it by 15 percentage points in 2016. But McGrath turned it into a tight race, attracting national attention with viral TV ads, including one that showcased her 89 combat missions. The Associated Press declared Barr the winner."

      "text": "Texas redistricting move would \u2018trigger\u2019 new California maps, Newsom says\n- Share via\n- The outcome of the dueling state efforts could decide which party controls the House of Representatives after the 2026 midterm elections.\n- Nothing official can be done until state lawmakers return from recess to Sacramento on Aug. 18.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A last-ditch effort by California Democrats to redraw the state\u2019s congressional map for the 2026 election, countering a similar push by Texas Republicans, is now up against the clock.\nGov. Gavin Newsom said Monday that Democrats are moving forward with a plan to put a rare mid-decade redistricting plan before voters on Nov. 4. But state lawmakers will craft a \u201ctrigger,\u201d he said, meaning California voters would only vote on the measure if Texas moved forward with its own plans to redraw Congressional boundaries to add five more Republican seats.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cause and effect, triggered on the basis of what occurs or doesn\u2019t occur in Texas,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cI hope they do the right thing, and if they do, then there\u2019ll be no cause for us to have to move forward.\u201d\nDemocratic lawmakers in Texas on Monday left the state to deprive Republicans of the quorum needed to pass the new maps. Republican lawmakers voted 85 to 6 to send state troopers to arrest them and bring them back to the Capitol, a move that is largely symbolic, since the lawmakers won\u2019t face criminal or civil charges.\nThe outcome of the dueling efforts between Texas and California could determine which party controls the House of Representatives after the 2026 midterm elections, which Democrats see as the last bulwark to President Trump\u2019s actions in his second term. Trump has pushed Republicans to add more GOP seats in Texas, hoping to stave off a midterm defeat.\nDemocrats hold 43 of California\u2019s 52 congressional seats. Early discussions among California politicians and strategists suggest that redrawn lines could shore up some vulnerable incumbent Democrats by making their purple districts more blue, while forcing five or six of the state\u2019s nine Republican members into tougher reelection fights.\nBut nothing official can be done until state lawmakers return from recess to Sacramento on Aug. 18.\nDemocrats, who hold a supermajority in the Legislature, would have less than a month to draw a new map, hold hearings and negotiate the language of a bill calling for the special November election, leaving just enough time for voter guides to be mailed and ballots to be printed.\nThe revolt by the state House Democrats, many of whom went to Illinois or New York on Sunday, and Abbott giving them less than 24 hours to come home ratcheted up a widening fight over congressional maps.\nDemocratic lawmakers and operatives said Monday that the timeline is doable, but they would have to act quickly.\nCalifornia\u2019s Democratic congressional delegation expressed consensus during a video meeting Monday with moving forward with a ballot measure that would allow mid-decade redistricting only if another state moves forward with it, according to a person familiar with the virtual meeting, and that the change would be temporary. They expressed their support for the independent commission.\nCalifornia Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said the Democratic caucus met Sunday night \u201cto discuss the urgent threat of a continued, blatant Trumpian power grab \u2014 a coordinated effort to undermine our democracy and silence Californians.\u201d\nDemocrats in the California Senate and Assembly held separate meetings to discuss redistricting. David Binder, a pollster who works with Newsom, presented internal polling that showed tepid early support among voters for temporarily changing state laws to allow the Legislature to draw new maps for elections in 2026, 2028 and 2030.\n\u201cOur voters must be empowered to push back,\u201d Rivas said. \u201cCalifornia has never backed down \u2014 and we won\u2019t start now.\u201d\nTexas Democrats resist\nDemocratic lawmakers\u2019 exodus from Austin on Monday denied Republicans the quorum necessary to proceed with a vote on a redrawn state map that could net Republicans five congressional seats.\nDemocratic lawmakers balked at threats from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. The Texas House Democratic Caucus put out a statement riffing on a slogan made famous during the Texas Revolution: \u201cCome and take it.\u201d One member of the caucus noted that being absent was not a crime and that Texas warrants can\u2019t be served in Illinois or New York, where many lawmakers have gone.\n\u201cThere is no felony in the Texas penal code for what he says,\u201d said Rep. Jolanda Jones, a Democrat. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to get soundbites, and he has no legal mechanism.\u201d\nThe Texas House Republican speaker, Dustin Burrows, said that Democrats leaving does not \u201cstop this House from doing its work. It only delays it.\u201d\nBut Abbott\u2019s legal options to get his redistricting bill passed, by expelling Democrats or compelling their return, appear narrow, likely forcing the governor\u2019s office to make challenges in courtrooms based in Democratic districts. Abbott has until the end of the year to secure new maps for them to be used in the state\u2019s March 3 primaries.\nAt a news conference last week in Sacramento, Newsom compared Trump\u2019s pressure on Abbott to add five Republican congressional seats as akin to his efforts to \u201cfind\u201d 12,000 votes to win Georgia after the 2020 election.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here to eliminate the commission,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to provide a pathway in \u201926, \u201928 and in 2030 for congressional maps on the basis of a response to the rigging of the system by the president of the United States. It won\u2019t just happen in Texas. I imagine he\u2019s making similar calls all across this country. It\u2019s a big deal. I don\u2019t think it gets much bigger.\u201d\nEscalation on a deadline\nFor decades, redrawing California\u2019s electoral maps amounted to political warfare. In 1971, then-Gov. Ronald Reagan vetoed a redistricting plan that he called \u201ca mockery of good government.\u201d The California Supreme Court ultimately drew the lines, and did so again in 1991, when then-Gov. Pete Wilson rejected maps drawn by Democrats.\nCalifornia\u2019s state lawmakers last drew their own district lines in 2001, after members of both parties signed off on a plan drawn up to protect incumbents.\nIn 2008, California voters stripped state lawmakers of the power to draw their own districts by passing Proposition 11, which created an independent redistricting commission. Two years later, voters handed the power to redraw congressional district maps to the same panel by passing Proposition 20. That group drew the lines before the 2012 elections, and again after the 2020 census.\nCalifornia set the date for its last statewide special election \u2014 the 2021 attempted recall of Newsom \u2014 75 days in advance. County election officials would need at least that much time to find voting locations and prepare ballots for overseas and military voters, which must be mailed 45 days before election day, one elections official said.\n\u201cWe need at least a similar timeline and calendar to what took place in 2021 for the gubernatorial recall election,\u201d said Dean Logan, the top elections official in Los Angeles County.\nCalifornia\u2019s governor wants to redraw congressional lines to offset a Texas gerrymander. Is that snubbing voters who took the power from politicians? Or necessarily fighting fire with fire?\nSimilarly, he said, counties will \u201cneed the funding provided upfront by the state to conduct this election, and the funding to do the redistricting associated with it, because counties are not prepared financially.\u201d\nThe 2021 recall election cost California taxpayers about $200 million. The preliminary estimate for Los Angeles County to administer the redistricting election is about $60 million.\nNational fight over state lines\nRepublican strategist Jon Fleischman, former executive director of the California Republican Party, said Republicans nationally need to take state Democrats\u2019 efforts to redraw the maps seriously \u2014 by pulling out their checkbooks.\n\u201cOur statewide Republican fundraising has atrophied because it has been over a generation since we had a viable statewide candidate in California,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kind of money that it would take to battle this \u2014 it would have to be national funding effort.\u201d\nWhile Texas prompted California Democrats to take action, Fleischman said, the issue has enough momentum here that it ultimately doesn\u2019t matter what Texas does.\n\u201cIf Gavin Newsom places this on the ballot, it means he\u2019s already done his polling and has figured out that it will pass because he cares more running for president that redistricting in California,\u201d Fleischman said. \u201cAnd he knows he can\u2019t afford to make this play and lose.\u201d\nFormer Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who championed the ballot measure that created the independent redistricting commission, has not weighed in on the mid-decade redistricting efforts in Texas and California. But a spokesperson for the former governor made clear that he vehemently opposes both.\nSince leaving office, Schwarzenegger has fought for independent map-drawing across the nation. Redistricting is among the political reforms that are the focus of the Schwarzenegger Institute at USC.\n\u201cHis take on all of this is everyone learned in preschool or kindergarten that two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. He thinks gerrymandering is evil,\u201d said Daniel Ketchell, a spokesperson for Schwarzenegger. \u201cIt takes power from the people and gives it to politicians. He thinks it\u2019s evil, no matter where they do it.\u201d\nWilner reported from Washington, Nelson and Mehta from Los Angeles and Luna from Sacramento."

Greg Abbott and Republicans in the GOP-controlled Texas state legislature to approve new congressional maps to help Republicans maintain control of the U.S. House during the 2026 midterm elections.\n\"We can\u2019t lose focus on what matters \u2013 right now, Republicans in Texas are trying to gerrymander district lines to unfairly win five seats in next year\u2019s midterm elections,\" Obama said.\nFormer U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who chairs the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, has helped lead Democratic efforts to fight the proposed Texas maps. Holder called the effort \"an authoritarian move\" during an Aug. 3 appearance on ABC's \"This Week.\"\nRedistricting is required by federal law every 10 years following the release of new U.S. Census Bureau figures; however, Trump pushed Texas Republicans to jumpstart the process in the middle of the decade. The president argued during an Aug. 5 appearance on CNBC that Republicans \"are entitled to five more seats\" in Texas because of his 2024 election victory in the state.\nThe 38-member Texas congressional delegation is currently comprised of 25 Republicans, 12 Democrats and there is one vacant seat that leans Democratic.\nThe new maps, advanced by a Texas legislative committee Aug. 2, create five new GOP-leaning districts and target Democratic incumbents, which would give Republicans in Congress more cushion to defend their slim House majority of 220-212.\nAbbott this week ordered Texas law enforcement to arrest Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to prevent the legislature from having a quorum to block a vote on redistricting.\nThe plan has ignited a nasty and partisan tug-of-war with Democratic governors in Illinois, New York and California pledging to return the favor and redraw their congressional maps to add more Democratic districts.\nIn California, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed temporarily setting aside his state's independent redistricting commission to create new Democratic-leaning congressional districts.\nHouse Democrats in the California legislature took steps this week toward a plan that could create up to six new gerrymandered Democratic congressional seats to offset the redistricting in Texas.

      "text": "Senate acquits Trump in historic second impeachment trial over Capitol riot\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Senate acquitted former President Donald Trump a second time after a historic trial where House managers painted him as a lingering threat after his supporters led a deadly riot in the Capitol on Jan. 6, but Republican senators found the effort unnecessary for a president no longer in office.\nA 57-43 majority of the Senate voted to convict Trump \u2013 short of the two-thirds majority required for conviction. Seven Republicans joined the 50 lawmakers who caucus with Democrats. Trump was also acquitted a year ago in his first trial about his dealings with Ukraine, when a majority opposed conviction and only one Republican joined Democrats voting to convict.\nTrump is the first president impeached twice and the first to be tried after leaving office. Trump was only the third president tried in the Senate, and all three were acquitted. The Senate vote against Trump was the most bipartisan push for conviction of a president \u2013 the others faced votes entirely from the opposition party.\nTrump issued a statement thanking his supporters in Congress.\n\u201cOur cherished Constitutional Republic was founded on the impartial rule of law, the indispensable safeguard for our liberties, our rights and our freedoms,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt is a sad commentary on our times that one political party in America is given a free pass to denigrate the rule of law, defame law enforcement, cheer mobs, excuse rioters, and transform justice into a tool of political vengeance, and persecute, blacklist, cancel and suppress all people and viewpoints with whom or which they disagree.\u201d\nThe latest article of impeachment charged Trump with inciting the insurrection Jan. 6 at the Capitol, which left five dead, including a police officer and a woman shot by police. Rioters rampaged through the building, interrupting the Electoral College vote count and searching for Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\nHouse managers who prosecuted the case argued Trump should be convicted and disqualified from holding future office to prevent the threat of more violence. The managers described how Trump spent months challenging his election loss before encouraging his supporters the day of the riot to \"fight like hell\" and \"show strength\" to \"demand that Congress do the right thing.\"\nPence was presiding in the Senate over the count that confirmed Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election when rioters breached the building. Minutes after the Secret Service evacuated Pence from the Senate chamber, Trump tweeted, \"Mike Pence didn\u2019t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.\"\nHouse managers and Trump's defense team agreed Saturday to allow a statement from Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Wash., into evidence. She described a call from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to Trump, pleading for him to call off the mob.\n\u201cWell, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,\u201d Beutler quoted Trump as telling McCarthy.\nHouse managers argued that demonstrated Trump's indifference to the violence he unleashed.\n\u201cHe knew how combustible the situation was, how many people in the crowd were ready to jump into action, to engage in violence at any signal that he needed them to fight like hell,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the lead House prosecutor. \u201cThey attacked this building, they disrupted the peaceful transfer of power, they injured and killed people, convinced they were acting on his instructions with his approval and protection.\u201d\nHouse managers said Trump stood by for hours without publicly calling for the mob to halt its clashes with police. The prosecutors argued his inaction showed he condoned the violence.\nWhen Trump tweeted for people to \"go home with love & in peace,\" the same tweet said, \"These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots.\" House managers said Trump reveled in the violence by ending the tweet: \"Remember this day forever!\"\nRaskin urged the Senate to convict and disqualify Trump from future office, to prevent more violence.\n\u201cIf that is not grounds for conviction, if that\u2019s not a high crime and misdemeanor against the Republic and the United States of America, then nothing is,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cPresident Trump must be convicted for the safety and security of our democracy and our people.\u201d\nThe seven Republicans who voted guilty were Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.\n\u201cThe president promoted unfounded conspiracy theories to cast doubt on the integrity of a free and fair election because he did not like the results,\u201d Burr said. \u201cWhen the crowd became violent, the president used his office to first inflame the situation instead of immediately calling for an end to the assault.\u201d\n\u201cTribalism is a hell of a drug, but our oath to the Constitution means we\u2019re constrained to the facts,\u201d Sasse said.\nToomey, who will retire next year, said House managers made a stronger case than Trump's defense team.\n\"I thought the House impeachment managers made very strong arguments; it was persuasive and well-grounded in the Constitution and precedent,\" Toomey said. Of the Trump team, he said, \"I think they had a weaker case to start with, and I don't think it was very persuasive.\"\nTrump\u2019s lawyers and most Senate Republicans argued that he couldn\u2019t be held responsible for the mob\u2019s violence. His defenders called the attack repugnant and said the rioters must be brought to justice, but Trump called for a \u201cpeaceful\u201d protest as he urged supporters to \u201cfight\u201d for the country.\n\u201cWhat took place at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 was a grave tragedy,\u201d said Michael van der Veen, one of Trump's lawyers. \u201cNo matter how much truly horrifying footage we see of the conduct of the rioters, how much emotion has been injected into this trial, that does not change the fact that Mr. Trump is innocent of the charges against him.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s defense team, which included Bruce Castor and David Schoen, argued that his speech near the White House on the day of the riot was protected by the First Amendment and that terms such as \"fight\" and \"show strength\" are common in any political speech.\n\u201cAt no point in their presentation, did you hear the House managers play a single example of Mr. Trump urging anyone to engage in violence of any kind,\u201d van der Veen said. \u201cAt no point did you hear anything that could ever possibly be construed as Mr. Trump encouraging or sanctioning an insurrection.\u201d\nThe FBI said two pipe bombs, which didn't explode, were placed outside the Democratic and Republican National Committees the night before the riot.\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Trump's lawyers explained how rioters planned the attack before the day of his speech.\n\"I think part of it was they were suggesting that there were people organizing the breach, even before he gave his speech, and then before he finished his speech, there were other developments, so their argument was that couldn't have been the cause of the insurrection,\" Cornyn said.\nMost Republican senators said the trial should not have been held after Trump left office. The Senate voted 56-44, with six Republicans joining all Democrats, to uphold the constitutionality of holding the trial.\nHouse managers argued that put the issue to rest, but van der Veen told senators they could vote to acquit for any reason, including concerns about the constitutionality of the case.\n\"I voted that this was unconstitutional, and so it makes it difficult to back up after that,\" said Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark.\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was among the senators arguing that voters, rather than the Senate, should decide whether to return Trump to office.\nContributing: Savannah Behrmann and Will Cummings"

The court cases have resulted in at least 25 nationwide injunctions through late April temporarily halting Trump's actions\nArresting judges. Threatening their impeachment. Routinely slamming them on social media and trying to go around them completely.\nPresident Donald Trump and his allies have led an intense pressure campaign on the judiciary four months into his administration. Both sides of the political spectrum are using the term constitutional crisis.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an all-out war on the lower courts,\u201d said former federal Judge John Jones III, who was appointed by President George W. Bush.\nAs the clash becomes a defining moment in the president's second term, conservative activists are pushing Congress to rein in federal judges and pressing Trump to intensify his fight with the courts. The Article III Project, a Trump-aligned group, arranged 164,000 phone calls, emails and social media messages to members of Congress in recent weeks urging lawmakers to back Trump in this judiciary fight. They called for impeaching Judge James Boasberg - one of the federal judges who has drawn MAGA's ire - after he ordered a temporary halt to Trump's effort to deport some immigrants. They also want lawmakers to cut the federal budget for the judiciary by $2 billion after Judge Amir Ali ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze that amount of foreign aid.\nThe group is supporting bills introduced by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, aimed at stopping federal district judges from issuing nationwide court orders, which have blocked some of Trump's policies. Mike Davis, a former Republican Senate aide and the Article III Project's founder and leader, said the legislation sends a message to Chief Justice John Roberts as the Supreme Court weighs taking a position on the injunctions. Issa's bill has cleared the House, while Grassley's has yet to advance.\n\"It\u2019s really effective,\" Davis said. \"When you talk about these legislative reforms it scares the hell out of the chief justice.\u201d\nConstitutional crisis warnings\nPizzas have been sent anonymously to the homes of judges and their relatives, prompting judges to raise concerns about apparent intimidation tactics. In his year-end report in December, Roberts warned that the court's independence is under threat from violence.\nActivists on the right are adopting some of the language being employed by Trump critics about an impending constitutional crisis, but with a very different meaning: opponents say Trump threatens the Constitution's separation of powers by ignoring court rulings, while Trump supporters say judges are usurping the president's rightful executive authority. Both argue that the nation is at a perilous moment.\nSteve Bannon \u2212 the president's former White House chief strategist \u2212 is predicting an explosive summer of crisis with the judicial battle at the center, saying on his podcast recently that the nation is approaching \"a cataclysmic\u201d moment. Many of Trump's critics agree, but believe it's a crisis of Trump and the right's own making.\n\"Some allies of the administration are inviting the constitutional crisis... because they want to enfeeble our judiciary and destroy our system of checks and balances,\" said Gregg Nunziata, an aide for Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he was in the Senate and now the executive director of the Society for the Rule of Law, a group founded by conservative legal figures from previous Republican administrations.\nExecutive orders and a clash between government branches\nTrump has pushed the boundaries of executive power during his first four months in office with aggressive moves that are drawing legal challenges, including shuttering whole federal agencies, mass layoffs of federal workers, firing members of independent board and taking dramatic steps to deport undocumented immigrants.\nHe also has invoked a 1798 wartime law to more quickly whisk people out of the country.\nTrump's actions have sparked nearly 250 legal challenges so far. The court cases have resulted in at least 25 nationwide injunctions through late April temporarily halting Trump's actions, according to the Congressional Research Service.\nFrustrated with unfavorable court decisions, the administration has taken an increasingly hostile stance to the federal bench. Trump complained in a May 11 social media post about a \u201cradicalized and incompetent Court System.\u201d\n\u201cThe American people resoundingly voted to enforce our immigration laws and mass deport terrorist illegal aliens,\" said White House spokesman Kush Desai. \"Despite what activist judges have to say, the Trump administration is legally using every lever of authority granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to deliver on this mandate.\u201d\nThe clash with the courts has sparked talk of a breakdown in the constitutional order. After the Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" the return of a Maryland resident wrongly deported to El Salvador and the administration continued to resist bringing him back, U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff, D-California, declared: \"The constitutional crisis is here. President Trump is disobeying lawful court orders.\"\nBannon talked in an NPR interview about a \"constitutional crisis that we're hurtling to.\" Trump and allies such as Davis have complained that the judges ruling against him are left wing partisans. \"Once judges take off their judicial robes and enter the political arena and throw political punches, they should expect powerful political counter punches,\" Davis said.\nYet some of the president's biggest legal setbacks have come from Republican-appointed judges, including multiple judges appointed by Trump. Judge Fernando Rodriguez of the Southern District of Texas is a Trump appointee who ruled against him on using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport certain migrants. Another Trump appointee, Judge Trevor McFadden with the D.C. District, ruled last month that the Trump administration must reinstate access to presidential events for the Associated Press news agency, which had been barred because it continued to use the term \"Gulf of Mexico\" instead of Gulf of America in its coverage.\nJones, who had a lifetime appointment to serve as a federal judge beginning in 2002 until he left to become president of Dickinson College in 2021, called the rhetoric directed at judges by the Trump administration \"abominable... and entirely inappropriate.\"\n\"It absolutely misrepresents the way the judges decide cases,\" he said. \"And unfortunately, many people are listening to this and and they're getting a completely mistaken impression of how judges do their jobs.\"\nDue process rights, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\nOne of the biggest points of contention has been due process rights, which are guaranteed under the Constitution's Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. They prohibit the federal and state governments from depriving any person \u201cof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d\nThe same rights American citizens have to contest government actions against them in court extend to undocumented immigrants facing detention and deportation.\nTrump came into office promising mass deportations and has moved aggressively, including invoking the Alien Enemies Act, which allows for the targeting of certain immigrants \"without a hearing and based only on their country of birth or citizenship,\" according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\nCourts have balked at his tactics.\nIn the most high-profile case, the Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration must \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident wrongly sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\nThe Supreme Court on May 16 also temporarily blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to more quickly deport a group migrants held in Texas, sending the case back to the appeals court to decide the merits of whether the president\u2019s use of the legislation is lawful, and if so what process should be used to remove people.\nThe administration hasn\u2019t brought Abrego Garcia back, and Trump has expressed frustration with the judiciary\u2019s insistence on due process. He lashed out after the latest Supreme Court ruling, writing on social media that the court \"is not allowing me to do what I was elected to do.\"\nTrump Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller brought up the debate on May 9 when he said the administration is investigating suspending habeas due process rights, which only is allowed by the Constitution to preserve public safety during \u201cRebellion or Invasion.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an option we\u2019re actively looking at,\u201d Miller said. \u201cLook, a lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.\u201d\nConservative media figure Rogan O'Handley told USA TODAY he saw online commentary about suspending habeas corpus and began promoting it to the 2.2 million followers of his @DC_Draino X handle. He said he was dismayed by the judicial rulings against Trump\u2019s immigration agenda and seized on the idea to \u201cget around\u201d the courts.\n\u201cWe had to step up the intensity of our tactics,\u201d he said.\nO\u2019Handley went on Bannon\u2019s podcast April 22 to promote suspending habeas. He was invited to join the White House press briefing on April 28 and asked a question about it. Two days later, on April 30, Trump was asked during a Cabinet meeting about his administration\u2019s planned response to the rash of nationwide injunctions against his deportation efforts and seemed to allude to suspending habeas.\nThe idea \u2013 last done in Hawaii in 1941 after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor \u2013 highlights how the Trump administration is determined to push through any legal or constitutional obstacle to its deportation plans.\nTrump and Chief Justice John Roberts\nAmong Trump's biggest obstacles so far during the second term is the judiciary, which repeatedly has blocked some of his actions, calling his methods unlawful and drawing his ire.\n\u201cWe need judges that are not going to be demanding trials for every single illegal immigrant,\" Trump told reporters recently on Air Force One. \"We have millions of people that have come in here illegally, and we can't have a trial for every single person.\u201d\nImmigration cases don't go before a jury, but instead are decided solely by an immigration judge.\nMiller has complained about a \u201cjudicial coup\u201d while Bannon, the podcaster and White House chief strategist during Trump's first administration, says there is a \u201cjudicial insurrection.\u201d\nThe conflict has been brewing for months.\nTrump said March 18 on social media that a federal judge who ruled against him in an immigration case should be impeached, drawing a rare rebuke from Roberts, the chief justice of the United States and another Bush appointee.\n\u201cFor more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\u201d Roberts said in March.\nTensions have only escalated.\nOn April 25 federal authorities announced charges against a Wisconsin judge and former New Mexico judge, accusing them of hampering immigration enforcement efforts. Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan pleaded not guilty May 15.\nOn May 22, the House passed Trump's sweeping tax legislation and included language inside the more than 1,100-page measure that could protect the Trump administration if a judge determined officials violated a court order. The language limits a judge's ability to hold someone in contempt of court if they \"fail to comply with an injunction or temporary restraining order.\"\nSuspending habeas corpus?\nConstitutional scholars told USA TODAY the Trump administration can\u2019t suspend habeas corpus without congressional approval.\n\u201cIf President Trump were to unilaterally suspend habeas corpus that\u2019s flagrantly unconstitutional,\u201d said University of North Carolina School of Law professor Michael Gerhardt.\nDuke Law Professor H. Jefferson Powell, a former deputy solicitor general during Democratic President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, said \u201cthe standard position of the vast majority of constitutional lawyers is that Congress alone\u201d can suspend habeas corpus.\n\u201cThis is not a close call,\u201d he said.\nAny attempt to suspend due process rights would be a shocking move, the equivalent of a \u201clegal earthquake,\u201d said Jones.\nMiller\u2019s comments added to the growing alarm among those concerned the Trump administration is threatening the rule of law and a constitutional crisis.\nJudges have reprimanded the Trump administration for not following their rulings. Boasberg found probable cause last month to hold the administration in contempt for \"deliberately and gleefully\" violating one of his orders. And Judge Brian Murphy with the Federal District Court in Boston ruled May 21 that the Trump administration \"unquestionably\" violated his order not to deport people to countries that are not their own without giving them an opportunity to contest the move.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a May 22 press briefing that the \"administration has complied with all court orders,\" slammed Murphy's ruling and complained about \"radical\" judges.\nMurphy is \"undermining our immigration system, undermining our foreign policy and our national security,\" Leavitt said.\nJones said the administration is playing \u201cgames with the lower courts\u201d but the real sign of a constitutional crisis would be if the Supreme Court sets a \u201cbright line\u201d that the Trump administration disregards.\n\"We\u2019re on the verge, maybe, of that,\" he said."

      "text": "Which states are being impacted by Texas' redistricting battle?\nWhat started on the floor of the Austin, Texas statehouse last week has rapidly mushroomed into a multi-state standoff with national implications, as the Lone Star State\u2019s redistricting battle continues to bleed beyond its borders.\nDozens of Texas Democrats have fled to three blue states in a bid to stave off a vote on the proposed map, which could give Republicans five more seats in Congress ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\nSeveral Democratic state leaders have entered the fray, and two GOP lawmakers announced efforts to take the issue to the U.S. Capitol in recent days. President Donald Trump lent his opinion on the melee Aug. 5, as Texas Republicans\u2019 redistricting fight now stretches across at least five states and captures national attention.\nHere\u2019s how Texas\u2019 redistricting crisis has ballooned into state-on-state fights over the last week:\nIllinois, New York and Massachusetts host Texas Democrats\nThe governors of Illinois, New York and Massachusetts are hosting Democratic lawmakers from Texas after they fled their home state Sunday, Aug. 3. The lawmakers\u2019 mass absence from the legislature prevents the quorum Republicans need to call for a vote on the new map, which is likely to pass among its GOP majority.\nUnder the new maps, Texas' congressional districts in the Houston, Austin and Dallas metro areas would be redrawn, along with a handful in southern Texas, creating five additional districts that would have heavily favored Trump in last year's presidential race. By extension, these Republican-heavy new districts would very likely go to GOP candidates in congressional elections, strengthening the party\u2019s currently slim majority in Congress.\nMore than 50 of Texas' 67 Democratic lawmakers have fled the state as of Tuesday, Aug. 5, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has ordered their arrests \u2212 though it's unclear whether and how Texas law enforcement will be able to work with out-of-state law enforcement to execute the arrest order.\nStates threaten to redraw their own maps in response\nNew York and California have threatened to launch their own redistricting, sparking a kind of political arms race between Democratic and Republican states.\nCalifornia\u2019s Democratic governor Gavin Newsom, though not hosting any Texas lawmakers, joined New York governor Kathy Hochul in threatening to use his state\u2019s overwhelming blue majority to counteract Texas Republicans\u2019 plans. Both governors lead two of the most powerful Democratic states.\nGov. Gavin Newsom said in a press conference Monday, Aug. 4 that his plans are to \u201cfight fire with fire,\u201d instructing Democrats to move forward with an effort to redraw the most populous state\u2019s congressional districts if Texas moves forward with its proposed map. He said Democrats are moving forward with a plan to put the redistricting plan before voters on Nov. 4.\nIn a press conference the same day, Hochul discussed the possibility of new maps in her state.\n\"This is a war. We are at war,\" she said. \"And that's why the gloves are off and I say, 'Bring it on.'\"\nRepublicans in Missouri, New York and California propose their own responses\nIn red Missouri, a coalition of the state\u2019s conservative GOP lawmakers issued a statement on July 25 urging Gov. Mike Kehoe to call for its own redistricting effort, which would give Republicans an advantage. The governor's spokesperson Gabby Picard told POLITICO on Tuesday, Aug. 5 that Kehoe \u201cwill always consider options\u201d which \u201cprovide congressional districts that best represent Missourians\" regarding the push for a map redraw.\nBut not all GOP lawmakers appear to be on board with fighting one map with another. Two Republicans, Reps. Kevin Kiley of California and Mike Lawler of New York announced that they will introduce bills to place nationwide limits on all such partisan gerrymandering. Kiley\u2019s proposal would prohibit mid-decade redistricting, which would likely spike Texas Republicans' efforts and the tit-for-tat proposals from New York and California.\nWhatever happens in Texas, the fight over Congress via redistricting will continue in Ohio later this month, where Republicans hold a supermajority in the state legislature.\nContributing: Phillip M.

  "argos_summary": "The political landscape in the U.S. is shifting as Texas Republicans push for a mid-decade redistricting plan that could add five GOP seats in the House, a move seen as crucial for Donald Trump's presidency ahead of the 2026 midterms. This has prompted a fierce response from Democrats, including a mass exodus of Texas lawmakers to deny Republicans a quorum, and threats from Democratic governors in states like California and New York to redraw their own congressional maps in retaliation. The outcome of these redistricting battles could significantly influence control of Congress and the future of Trump's agenda.",
