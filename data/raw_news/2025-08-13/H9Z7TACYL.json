  "title": "Apple's AirPods Pro 2 are 32 percent off right now",
  "description": "The non-ANC AirPods 4 are also discounted.",
  "content": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products .\n\nEven a few years after launch, the AirPods Pro 2 remain some of the best wireless earbuds you can get \u2014 particularly if you primarily use other Apple devices on the daily. If you're looking to upgrade from an old pair or want a fresh set for the new school year, you can pick up the AirPods Pro 2 for $169 right now. That's 32 percent off their usual price and one of the best prices we've seen this year.\n\nApple\u2019s flagship AirPods were $100 off \u2014 a record-low $149 \u2014 during Prime Day, so we have seen them even cheaper than this, but for a non-sale period, Amazon\u2019s current deal is worth considering. The AirPods Pro 2 are our top choice for iPhone users looking for wireless earbuds, thanks to much beefier sound than the original model, rock solid ANC and transparency modes, and seamless switching between Apple devices.\n\nThrow in spatial audio support, hands-free Siri and more than acceptable battery life, and the AirPods Pro 2 are hard to top. Not everyone gets on with the sometimes fiddly touch gestures, but a lot of wireless headphones struggle with this. If there\u2019s anything to give you pause, it\u2019s that we might be getting the AirPods Pro 3 sooner rather than later. But if that\u2019s the case, you can be confident you\u2019ll pay a lot more than $169 for the privilege.\n\nThe AirPods Pro aren\u2019t the only discounted AirPods right now. The AirPods 4 (without ANC) are down to $99. Usually priced at $129, you\u2019re saving $30 on a much improved entry-level AirPods offering. They fit and sound better than any non-Pro AirPods before them, and inherit some previously Pro-only features thanks to the H2 chip. If you travel a lot you\u2019ll also certainly rue the lack of ANC, but if that isn\u2019t a deal breaker for you, the $99 price point might be tempting.\n\nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.",

The AirPod Pro 2, which launched in 2004, are still considered some of the top wireless earbuds for iPhone users due to their beefier sound and seamless switching between Apple devices. They also offer spatial audio support, hands-free Siri, and excellent battery life. However, they may be replaced by the AirPod Pro 3, which could be released soon. Other discounted products include Apple's AirPod 4 (without ANC) for $99, an improved entry-level offering that costs $30 more.",

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nThe best wireless earbuds for 2025\nThese are the wireless earbuds we've tested and reviewed that are the best for all needs and budgets.\nFinding the best wireless earbuds can make a huge difference in how you experience music, podcasts, calls and even daily commutes. Whether you're tuning out distractions on the train or taking work calls on the go, today\u2019s wireless earbuds pack impressive audio quality and convenience into tiny, pocket-friendly forms. Many now offer excellent noise cancellation, smart ambient noise modes for staying aware of your surroundings and reliable noise isolation to help keep you focused \u2014 all without the hassle of wires.\nThere\u2019s a wide range of options available, from budget-friendly picks to premium models with advanced features like multi-device pairing, wireless charging cases and multiple mics for crystal-clear calls. No matter your price point, there\u2019s a pair out there that can deliver great sound, comfort and functionality to match your needs.\nTable of contents\nBest wireless earbuds of 2025\nRead our full Sony WF-1000XM5 review\nMax battery life: 8 hours, up to 24 hours with charging case | Water resistance: IPX4 | Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Included charging case: Yes | Waterproof: Yes (IPX4) | Driver size: 8.4mm\nWith the WF-1000XM5 flagship earbuds, Sony improves its already formidable mix of great sound, effective ANC and handy features. These earbuds are undoubtedly the company\u2019s best and most comfortable design of its 1000X models so far, which was one of the few remaining riddles Sony needed to solve. Sony still manages to pack in more features than anyone else too, including trademark ones like adaptive sound and Speak-to-Chat. Add in upgraded drivers, new chips, eight hours of battery life and significant improvements to sound quality and these are Sony\u2019s best earbuds yet. But all of the advancements come at a cost: these are also Sony\u2019s most expensive set of wireless earbuds in the 1000X lineup.\n- Excellent sound quality\n- Improved design\n- More comfortable fit\n- Loads of handy features\n- More expensive\n- No battery life improvement\n- Head tracking is Android only\n- Some features still need fine-tuning\nRead our full Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) review\nMax battery life: 6 hours, up to 30 hours with charging case | Water resistance: IPX4 | Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Included charging case: Yes | Waterproof: Yes (IPX4) | Driver size: Not specified\nApple\u2019s second-generation AirPods Pro are a huge improvement over the previous models. These buds have improved sound quality and active noise cancellation, while maintaining all of the conveniences that make AirPods the best earbud option for iPhone, iOS and Mac. When we reviewed them, we found the most impressive feature to be transparency mode, which is more natural sounding than any other earbuds by a mile. You can leave these in during a conversation and it\u2019s like you\u2019re not even wearing them. Of course, fast pairing, hands-free Siri, spatial audio, good battery life, and now, a USB-C charging case that can also power up wirelessly will also come in handy.\n- Improved sound\n- Stellar transparency mode\n- Solid ANC\n- Seamless switching between Apple devices\n- Same design\n- New touch gesture takes practice\n- Average battery life\n- Personalized Spatial Audio results vary\nRead our full Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 review\nMax battery life: 8 hours, up to 30 hours with charging case (ANC on) | Water resistance: IP54 | Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Included charging case: Yes | Waterproof: Yes (IPX4 for earbuds, IPX2 for case) | Driver size: 11mm\nThe Pixel Buds Pro 2 may be Google\u2019s priciest earbuds, but they\u2019re also its best. A complete redesign resulted in significantly smaller earbuds that fit more comfortably and securely. The company has also packed in a Tensor chip for the first time to handle audio and ANC signal processing. As you might expect, these earbuds offer a hands-free channel to Gemini AI, although they\u2019re not required to use the voice assistant.\nGoogle also revised the acoustics and drivers on the Pixel Buds Pro 2, delivering ample low-end tone when it\u2019s needed. There are plenty of handy features too, like Conversation Detection, Hearing Wellness and Find My Device. Spatial Audio is available at launch this time, but you can only use it with compatible video streaming apps.\n- Tiny, comfy design\n- Punchy bass, full mids, crisp highs\n- Slightly longer battery life than predecessor\n- Price went up again\n- Spatial audio is limited to video apps\n- Smaller touch panel requires precision\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review\nMax battery life: 6 hours, up to 26 hours with charging case | Water resistance: IP57 | Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Included charging case: Yes | Waterproof: Yes (IP68) | Driver size: Dual drivers (woofer and tweeter); specific sizes not disclosed\nThe Galaxy Buds 3 Pro borrow heavily from Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro in both looks and features, and build upon the foundation of the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. However, Samsung did well to make things like Adaptive ANC and voice commands work well. Some features like Voice Detect could still use some fine tuning, but there\u2019s a lot to like here beyond the basic functionality.\nThe truly surprising thing about the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro is the sound quality. There is some thick, boomy bass when you need it with plenty of crisp detail to complement it. This model really shines when you pair it with a Samsung device to unlock 24-bit HiFi streaming. There\u2019s also a natural-sounding transparency mode that keeps you from feeling shouty during calls.\n- Great sound quality\n- Loads of handy features\n- Comfy fit\n- Natural ambient sound\n- Battery life is shorter than some rivals\n- The best features require a recent Samsung device\n- Copycat design\n- Blade lights are a gimmick\nMax battery life: 10 hours, up to 50 hours with charging case | Water resistance: IPX4 | Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Included charging case: Yes | Waterproof: Not specified | Driver size: Not specified\nThe Anker Soundcore Space A40 offer the kind of features you\u2019d expect from wireless earbuds that cost twice as much: ANC, multi-device pairing, wireless charging, IPX4 water resistance, a transparency mode, eight to ten hours of battery life and LDAC support. When we tested them, we found their warm sound to be pleasing right out of the box, but Anker\u2019s companion app makes it easy to customize the EQ curve if needed. And while their ANC isn\u2019t quite as effective at reducing background noise as our top picks, it\u2019s still effective for a noisy office or long flight. For $80 or so, this is a superb value. \u2013 Jeff Dunn, Senior Commerce Writer\n- Affordable\n- Good battery life\n- Multipoint connectivity\n- Transparency Mode\n- ANC isn't as strong as competitors\nRead our full Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds review\nMax battery life: 6 hours, up to 24 hours with charging case | Water resistance: IPX4 | Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Included charging case: Yes | Waterproof: Yes (IPX4) | Driver size: Not specified\nSince the company introduced the first model, Bose\u2019s QuietComfort Earbuds have consistently provided the best noise cancellation out of all the wireless buds we've tested. It\u2019s not surprising that its most-recent version, the QC Ultra Earbuds, only improved in ANC performance. However, the bigger story here is that Bose finally has the audio chops to compete with the best earbuds thanks to its new Immersive Audio tech. The feature brings spatial audio to all by not requiring specially-made content to use it. Rather than employ music and movies where the sound is coming from all directions, QC Ultra Earbuds put you in the middle of the acoustic \u201csweet spot\u201d by relying heavily on virtualization. A dedicated gesture for volume controls, better-than-advertised battery life and customization settings round out the spec sheet.\n- Stellar ANC\n- Spatial audio doesn't require special content\n- Upgrades with no price increase\n- Earbuds are still big\n- Immersive Audio significantly impacts battery life\n- Wireless charging costs extra\nRead our full Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (2024) review\nMax battery life: 8.5 hours, up to 31.5 hours with charging case | Water resistance: IPX4 | Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Included charging case: Yes | Waterproof: Yes (IPX4) | Driver size: Not specified\nBefore now, you had to pay around $300 if you wanted Bose-quality ANC on a set of earbuds. With the new QuietComfort Earbuds, the company packs in a lot of its best features for less money. You\u2019ll get effective ANC, good sound quality, and features like voice controls.\nThe earbuds are smaller than typical Bose fare, which means they\u2019re more comfortable and fit better. You\u2019ll also enjoy well over eight hours of battery life with ANC on and an IPX4 rating that will be good enough for workouts. And if the product page is to be trusted, you can also look forward to Bose\u2019s unique spatial audio (Immersive Audio) coming soon.\n- Great sound quality\n- Effective ANC\n- Lots of handy features\n- Dependable battery life\n- No Immersive Audio (yet)\n- Audio and ANC sacrifices compared to the QC Ultra Earbuds\n- No CustomTune feature\n- Poor call quality\nRead our full Noble Audio FoKus Rex5 review\nMax battery life: 5 hours (ANC on), up to 45 hours with charging case | Water resistance: N/A | Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Included charging case: Yes | Waterproof: Not specified | Driver size: Not specified\nIf you want the best sound quality, you\u2019ll have to pay for it. The FoKus Rex5 are an eyewatering $449, and easily the most expensive wireless earbuds I\u2019ve tested. However, Noble Audio\u2019s five-driver setup is more robust than the competition where one or two drivers is typically the norm.\nThere\u2019s a level of pristine detail and sonic separation I haven\u2019t heard on other earbuds. For example, characteristics of the guitars, including the individual nuances of multiple players on a track, contribute to a wider soundstage and more immersion than you\u2019ll encounter elsewhere. These are far from a complete package in terms of features, but the audio prowess is unmatched.\n- Detailed, immersive sound\n- Custom audio profiles are saved on the buds\n- Comfortable fit\n- Very expensive\n- Just one color and it\u2019s not for everyone\n- Subpar ANC performance\nRead our full Technics AZ100 review\nMax battery life: 12 hours, up to 29 hours with charging case | Water resistance: IPX4 | Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Included charging case: Yes | Waterproof: Yes (IPX4) | Driver size: 10mm\nFor a long while Bowers & Wilkins was my pick for best overall sound quality. But, as Dylan sang, \u201cthe times they are a-changin\u2019.\u201d\nTechnics borrowed magnetic fluid driver tech from its in-ear monitors (IEMs) to improve the sound quality on the AZ100. The result is deeper, more immersive bass that\u2019s complemented by detailed highs and ample mid-range tone.\nThere are also a lot of features on the AZ100, including multipoint Bluetooth for up to three devices. Sony\u2019s LDAC codec is also supported, as are Dolby Atmos and Dolby\u2019s dynamic head tracking.\n- Excellent sound quality\n- Tons of options in the app\n- Small size means comfy fit\n- Three-device multipoint Bluetooth\n- ANC lags behind the best\n- None of today\u2019s \u201csmart\u201d features\n- Spatial audio doesn\u2019t improve default tuning\nRead our full Beats Fit Pro review\nMax battery life: 6 hours, up to 24 hours with charging case | Water resistance: IPX4 | Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Included charging case: Yes | Waterproof: Yes (IPX4) | Driver size: Not specified\nMost of the best AirPods features in a set of workout earbuds? That\u2019s the Beats Fit Pro. Thanks to Apple\u2019s H1 chip, these buds offer one-touch quick pairing, hands-free Siri and Find My tools. They\u2019ll also allow you to use Audio Sharing with an Apple device and another set of AirPods or Beats wireless headphones for tandem listening or viewing. Balanced and punchy bass will keep the energy up during workouts while good noise cancellation, an IPX4 rating and comfy silicone ear tips make these a solid option outside of the gym too. And there\u2019s plenty of support for Android devices, so these aren\u2019t just a good buy for iOS users either.\n- Comfortable design\n- Good ANC\n- H1 chip offers quick pairing and switching between Apple devices\n- Plenty of Android support\n- Call quality could be better\nMax battery life: 6 hours, up to 20 hours with charging case | Water resistance: IPX4 | Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Included charging case: Yes | Waterproof: Yes (IPX4) | Driver size: Not specified\nOne of the biggest surprises last year wasn\u2019t Sony\u2019s unique open-wear LinkBuds, it was the more mainstream follow-up. With the LinkBuds S, the company debuted a more traditionally designed pair of earbuds akin to its premium WF-1000XM4, only this model is much smaller and lighter which leads to a much more comfy fit. These tiny wireless earbuds muster some punch when it comes to sound quality too and support for high-res listening (LDAC and DSEE Extreme) are both onboard. Capable ANC lends a hand with environmental noise and transparency mode can keep you tuned in when needed. What\u2019s more, handy Speak-to-Chat is here and Adaptive Sound Control can automatically change settings based on activity or location. That\u2019s a lot of premium features at a mid-range price.\n- Comfortable design\n- Good sound quality\n- Speak-to-Chat\n- Adaptive Sound Control\n- Average battery life\nWhat to look for in the best wireless earbuds\nWhen it comes to shopping for earphones, the first thing to consider is design or wear style. Do you prefer a semi-open fit like AirPods or do you want something that completely closes off your ears? If you\u2019re shopping for earbuds with active noise cancellation, you'll want the latter, but a case can be made for the former if you want to wear them all day or frequent places where you need to be tuned in to the ambient sounds. The overall shape of earbuds can determine whether you get a comfortable fit, so can the size and weight, so you\u2019ll want to consider all that before deciding. And remember: audio companies aren\u2019t perfect, so despite lots of research, the earbud shape they decided on may not fit you well. Don\u2019t be afraid to return ill-fitting earbuds for something that\u2019s more comfortable.\nAs wireless earbuds have become the norm, they\u2019re now more reliable for basic things like consistent Bluetooth connectivity. Companies are still in a race to pack as much as they can into increasingly smaller designs. This typically means a longer list of features on the more premium sets of earbuds with basic functionality on the cheapest models. Carefully consider what you can\u2019t live without when selecting your next earbuds, and make sure key items like automatic pausing and multipoint connectivity are on the spec sheet. You\u2019ll also want to investigate the volume and touch controls as you\u2019ll often have to sacrifice access to something else to make that adjustment via on-board taps or swipes. Some earbuds even offer app settings to tweak the audio profiles or firmware updates to improve performance over time.\nFor those in the Apple ecosystem, features like auto-pairing with devices, especially with AirPods Pro 2, can be an added advantage, while Android users may want to look for models that offer similar cross-device functionality.\nWhen it comes to battery life, the average set of earbuds lasts about five hours on a single charge. You can find sets that last longer, but this is likely enough to get you through a work day if you\u2019re docking the buds during lunch or the occasional meeting. You\u2019ll want to check on how many extra charges are available via the case and if it supports wireless charging.\nCompanies will also make lofty claims about call quality on wireless earbuds. Despite lots of promises, the reality is most earbuds still leave you sounding like you\u2019re on speakerphone. There are some sets that deliver, but don\u2019t get your hopes up unless reviews confirm the claims.\nSound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. This is especially true if you're an audiophile. We understand this isn\u2019t easy when most of us do a lot of shopping online, but trying on a set of earbuds and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer's remorse. If a store doesn\u2019t allow a quick demo, most retailers have return policies that will let you take earbuds back you don\u2019t like. Of course, you have to be willing to temporarily part with funds in order to do this.\nWe also recommend paying attention to things like Spatial Audio, Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all earbuds support them, so you\u2019ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you, especially if you plan to use them for playback of high-quality audio.\nHow we test wireless earbuds\nThe primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don\u2019t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for earbuds is typically less than a full day, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent).\nTo judge audio quality, we listen to a range of genres, noting any differences in the sound profile across the styles. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess call quality, we\u2019ll record audio samples with the earbuds\u2019 microphones as well as have third parties call us.\nWhen it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds we\u2019re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we\u2019ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older buds. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of earbuds that we review.\nOther wireless Bluetooth earbuds we tested\nSony WF-C710N\nThe WF-C710N is a set of compact and comfy earbuds that offer several of Sony\u2019s best features. While the ANC performance is above average for this price ($120), sound quality isn\u2019t as good as the company\u2019s slightly more expensive options. Battery life fell below stated figures and call performance isn\u2019t good enough to use these buds for work.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2\nThe newest version of the Powerbeats Pro have an improved, comfortable design, balanced bass and new H2 chips and a heart rate sensor inside. But heart rate support is currently limited on iOS, and there's a possibility those capabilities make it onto the next AirPods Pro models.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3\nThe Galaxy Buds 3 combine ANC with an open-type design, which renders the noise-blocking abilities of the earbuds mostly useless. Still, there\u2019s great low-end tone with ample bass when a track demands it. There are also lots of handy features, most of which require a Samsung phone. But at this price, there are better options from Google, Beats and Sony\nSennheiser Momentum Sport\nI really like the overall shape of the Momentum Sport earbuds. They\u2019re more comfortable than the Momentum True Wireless 4 and fit in my ears better. What\u2019s more, the body temperature and heart rate sensors work well, sending those stats to a variety of apps. However, that sport-tracking feature works best with Polar\u2019s app and devices, so there\u2019s that consideration. Also, the audio quality and ANC performance isn\u2019t as good as the MTW4, and these earbuds are pricey.\nBeats Solo Buds\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about the Solo Buds for $80. For me, the primary perk is they\u2019re very comfortable to wear for long periods of time thanks to some thoughtful design considerations. You only get the basics here in terms of features and, as expected, the overall sound quality isn\u2019t as good as the pricier models in the Beats lineup. You will get 18 hours of battery life though, since the company nixed the battery in the case and beefed up the listening time in the buds themselves.\nBose Ultra Open Earbuds\nBose created something very unique for this set of earbuds that allows you to stay in-tune with the world while listening to audio content. The clip-on design is very comfortable, but sound quality suffers due to the open-type fit, especially when it comes to bass and spatial audio.\nAudio-Technica ATH-TWX7\nThese stick buds have a compact design that\u2019s comfortable to wear and the warm sound profile is great at times. However, overall audio performance is inconsistent and there\u2019s no automatic pausing.\nMaster & Dynamic MW09\nRetooled audio, better ambient sound mode and reliable multipoint Bluetooth are the best things the MW09 has to offer. They\u2019re expensive though, and you can find better ANC performance elsewhere.\nWireless earbud FAQs\nWhat is considered good battery life for true wireless earbuds?\nMost wireless earbuds will last five hours on a single charge, at the least. You can find some pairs that have even better battery life, lasting between six and eight hours before they need more juice. All of the best wireless earbuds come with a charging case, which will provide additional hours of battery life \u2014 but you'll have to return each bud to the case in order to charge them up.\nIs sound quality better on headphones or earbuds?\nComparing sound quality on earbuds and headphones is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. There are a lot of variables to consider and the differences in components make a direct comparison difficult. Personally, I prefer the audio quality from over-ear headphones, but I can tell you the sound from earbuds like Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 3 is also outstanding.\nWhich wireless earbuds have the longest battery life?\nWith new models coming out all the time, tracking the hours of battery life for each this can be difficult to keep tabs on. The longest-lasting earbuds we\u2019ve reviewed are Audio-Technica\u2019s ATH-CKS5TW. The company states they last 15 hours, but the app was still showing 40 percent at that mark during our tests. The only downside is these earbuds debuted in 2019 and both technology and features have improved since. In terms of current models, Master & Dynamic\u2019s MW08 offers 12 hours of use on a charge with ANC off (10 with ANC on) and JBL has multiple options with 10-hour batteries.\nWhat wireless earbuds are waterproof?\nThere are plenty of options these days when it comes to increased water resistance. To determine the level of protection, you\u2019ll want to look for an IP (ingress protection) rating. The first number indicates intrusion protection from things like dust. The second number is the level of moisture protection and you\u2019ll want to make sure that figure is 7 or higher. At this water-resistance rating, earbuds can withstand full immersion for up to 30 minutes in depths up to one meter (3.28 feet). If either of the IP numbers is an X, that means it doesn\u2019t have any special protection. For example, a pair of wireless earbuds that are IPX7 wouldn\u2019t be built to avoid dust intrusion, but they would be ok if you dropped them in shallow water.\nWhich earbuds stay in ears the best?\nA secure fit can vary wildly from person to person. All of our ears are different, so audio companies are designing their products to fit the most people they can with a single shape. This is why AirPods will easily fall out for some but stay put for others. Design touches like wing tips or fins typically come on fitness models and those elements can help keep things in place. You\u2019ll likely just have to try earbuds on, and if they don\u2019t fit well return them.\nWhat wireless earbuds work with PS5?\nPlayStation 5 doesn\u2019t support Bluetooth audio without an adapter or dongle. Even Sony\u2019s own gaming headsets come with a transmitter that connects to the console. There are universal options that allow you to use any headphones, headset or earbuds with a PS5. Once you have one, plug it into a USB port on the console and pair your earbuds with it.\nRecent updates\nMay 2025: Updated to ensure top picks and buying advice remain accurate.\nMarch 2025: Updated the top pick for the best sounding wireless earbuds - runner up.\nJanuary 2025: Updated the top pick for best sounding wireless earbuds.\nJuly 2024: Updated our list to include the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro."

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nThe best deals on MacBooks, AirPods, iPads and other Apple gear you can get right now\nYou can score a few record-low prices on some of the latest Apple devices.\nIt goes without saying that Apple devices tend to be fairly high-quality \u2014 the company's gear currently occupies the top spots in several of our buying guides, from laptops and tablets to smartphones and smartwatches. As a result, that gear usually doesn't come cheap. But that doesn\u2019t mean you always have to pay full price. Good Apple deals are often out there, so long as you know where to look.\nTo make things easier, we're keeping a running list of the best Apple deals you can shop right now on AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more. Just note that you\u2019ll almost always find the best Apple deals from third-party retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and the like, not from Apple's own online store. Unless you shop refurbished, you\u2019ll usually pay top dollar buying direct (though for some items like iPhones, that might be the best route to take).\nBest iPad deals\nThe latest iPad Air is a relatively minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still recommend this iPad over the base model in our iPad buying guide: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple\u2019s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. (Though both will benefit from the many changes coming with iPadOS 26.) This $150 discount is an all-time low and applies to each color and storage configuration. Also at Best Buy and Target.\nApple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nathan Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is another new low, and again, all color and storage configs are on sale.\nApple iPad Pro (13-inch, M4) for $1,099 ($200 off): The most powerful iPad is the iPad Pro. Both the 11- and 13-inch models have gorgeous 120Hz OLED displays, thinner and lighter designs, a repositioned front camera and the excessively powerful M4 chip inside. This 13-inch version is pricey, but it may be worth the extra cost if you plan to multitask regularly or just want more screen space for enjoying movies. While this isn't the absolute largest discount we've seen, it's a solid drop all the same. Be aware, though, that reports have said that Apple could release a new iPad Pro by the end of the year. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nApple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip \u2014 which is enough to support Apple Intelligence \u2014 along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As before, you\u2019d buy it if you value the smaller 8.3-inch display and want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is $20 more than the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nBest MacBook deals\nApple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major refresh overall, but that's not a bad thing \u2014 the design remains exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This drop ties an all-time low for base config with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD to a new low. Models with more memory or storage are also $200 off. Also at Best Buy.\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. $999 is the lowest price we've tracked.\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,199 ($500 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while stock remains available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review \u2014 outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal applies to the model with the larger 24GB of memory in the Starlight colorway.\nBest AirPods deals\nIf you don't need active noise cancellation, you can grab Apple's most affordable earbuds, the AirPods 4 without ANC. These came out last September at the same time as the latest iPhone. Engadget's Billy Steele reviewed them and appreciated their comfort, improved sound quality and advanced features like voice isolation for calls and Personalized Spatial Audio. This deal is $10 more than the pair's all-time low. Also at Walmart.\nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 ($80 off): The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple\u2019s best set of wireless earbuds for now, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid, though their six-hour battery life still isn\u2019t the best, and you should only get them if you\u2019re all-in on Apple hardware. But if that\u2019s the case, we consider them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners. This deal is $20 off the all-time low we saw last month, but it's still a ways below the set's usual going rate. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Exercise caution, though: If you're not in a rush, this is another Apple device that may see a refresh within the next couple of months.\nBest Apple Watch deals\nFor now, Apple\u2019s flagship wearable remains the best smartwatch you can buy. While the Series 10 is an iterative update, that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. It sports a slightly longer battery life, a slimmer design and wide-angle OLED screen for better viewing angles. It still tracks workouts accurately and delivers alerts to your wrist efficiently, though we will almost certainly see a new Series 11 model by the end of the year if you're not in any rush. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.\nApple Watch Ultra 2 for $650 ($149 off): Apple\u2019s most premium smartwatch, the Ultra 2 has a killer 36-hour battery life, a handy Low Power mode for extended use and cellular connectivity by default. It also has a compass app, water temperature gauge and a loud onboard siren that you can trigger in emergencies. This discount marks the lowest price we've tracked. But again, we wouldn't be surprised if Apple introduced an updated model in the coming weeks.\nApple Watch SE (GPS, 40mm) for $169 ($80 off): As with the more premium models, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see an update to Apple\u2019s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite a lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Target.\nBest Apple accessories deals\nThe highest-end option in Apple\u2019s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and support for Apple\u2019s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It\u2019s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it\u2019s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a decent discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Walmart and Best Buy.\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn\u2019t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you\u2019re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you\u2019ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also at Walmart and Best Buy.\nRead more Apple coverage:\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice."

Please reload the page.\n- Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024Style: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseI\u2019ve tried several hearing aid substitutes over the years, my past favorite being the now unavailable Bose Hearphones and costing $500. Rather than just a sound amplifier, these had several functions allowing you to filter and focus sounds in various ways and for various situations. They were pretty good.\nBut now Apple has added some great features to their AirPods 2\u2014features that function like far more expensive hearing aids and at less than half the price of the Bose product. I\u2019ve owned these for a month or so and am now just getting the hang of how to use them. If there is a downside to these earbuds it is the rather deep and confusing tech included in them (or, at least confusing for a grandfatherly type like me). Once they are Bluetooth connected to your iPhone (They connect very easily with the button on the front of the EarPod\u2019s charging case.) they should automatically connect every time you put them in your ears. You will then be able to access all the functions by tapping the \u201csettings\u201d app on your phone. You will find a heading near the top of the list just below the box with your name and iCloud options. Tapping on this will allow you to drill down through several pages of options. There are a lot of options there and it can be confusing, but experimenting with the various functions will help you figure out their purpose.\nThe key here is to drill down to find the hearing test. This will quickly test for hearing loss by leading you through a series of tones of varying in pitch and volume. The end result will be an audiogram that can be used to program your EarPods as hearing aids. As stated before, it took me several weeks to find and activate this feature, but when I did a whole new experience dawned. Just be patient and search around for this function. It works very well.\nOf course, these things also serve as EarPods to listen to music or podcasts. (May I recommend \u201cPat Gray Unleashed!\u201d if your bent is conservative commentary and just plain fooling around). The quality of sound is phenomenal and the buds are more comfortable than most to keep in your ears for an extended time. To control the volume for this function you can TRY to use the external control buttons located on those silly looking stems that hang out of your ears (good luck) OR just open the \u201cControl Center\u201d page (slide one finger upward on your iPhone screen to access this page) where you\u2019ll find the volume slider. If your EarPods are connected and in your ears you\u2019ll see the slider is marked as controlling the AirPods.\nI really like these things now that I\u2019m a little more familiar with them. The quality and value are exquisite. If I discover more, I\u2019ll edit this comment.\n4 MONTHS LATER: Apple has improved the controls for these in their latest iOS update. The functions I had to dig around to find are now more easily accessed. Getting to the hearing test is now fairly straight forward.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2025Style: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseThe AirPods Pro 2.0 earbuds are very close to perfection. I have four pairs. Two with the lightning connectors, and two with the now standard USB-C connectors. My USB-C pairs have the Mag-Lock charging as well. The sound is awesome! There are earbuds with more bass and higher volumes. But I believe for recreating quality live sound the Airpods produce clear sound that rivals listening to live music. They put out a reasonable amount of bass. I don\u2019t honestly think that folks will be satisfied if you want ear shattering bass. The vocals are crisp. The battery life is pretty darn good too! Even the first pair that I purchased in 2023 still runs for at least 4.5 hours playing music. If the Airpods are totally dead, they\u2019re recharged in about an hour. With the different sized silicone eartips, they will comfortably fit in most ears. Plus when they wear out, you can purchase replacements on Apple\u2019s store, or right here on Amazon. I think one of the best features is the sound dampening ability. I usually have this feature on. I believe that even with no music playing the Airpods cut noise down by at least 50%-70%. You can have the microphones set to when you start talking, they let sounds through. I think the microphones are of wonderful quality. The clarity is really good. It is very rare that someone says they\u2019re having a hard time hearing me. About the only negative is they are susceptible to interference from other devices every once in awhile. This is more prevalent in the summer than in the cooler months. They are discounted now to $169.00! This is much better than paying $249 or even $199. These are the best cordless earbuds I have ever purchased. I would definitely recommend these Airpods Pro 2.0 for the value they are.

YMMV\u2026 So, for those of us crusty old codgers with beat up ears, here's an interesting discovery I made today:\nI (unsurprisingly) listen to a lot of stuff while working out in my shop. And as a DOACA (\"Dude of a Certain Age\") who worked as a roadie & stage tech in the age of Grunge, I have pretty pronounced tinnitus, so I'm doubly careful about my hearing when using some of my larger shop tools, like my cabinet saw, mill, etc, which means I'm often putting hearing protection on, and taking it off repeatedly. I have a decent \"bone conduction\" headset that allows for environmental awareness, but the protectors don't work with those on. I have tried a few wireless earbuds (most recently the well reviewed certain-Lab \u201cMini\u201ds) but there was some problem or other with all of them (the Minis sound great, but have terrible connectivity).\nSo I finally sucked it up and got a set of Apple AirPod Pro 2s (yeah, mostly after hearing Adam Savage rave about them in a recent video you can easily find.) An interesting thing about them is that Apple actually worked with the US FDA (for those of you not in America, that's the federal agency that regulates medical devices here in the States\u2014you need to be certified by them to make any medical claims about a product or device) and got these to be certified as Class II hearing aids in the US and Canada. And in addition to a clinical-grade hearing test feature included that runs in the app, the Hearing Aid feature is easy to employ, and actually useful. But that's not what has me so jazzed about these.\nAside from the Bluetooth being rather astounding (my wife took my phone to the other end of the house about 40' away, with our chimney stack between us, and stuck it in her sock drawer\u2014totally fine), the noise cancellation is *shockingly* good. And this is where things get interesting, and where we get back around to my tinnitus.\nPutting these in my ears this morning while sitting in my dining area, next to our furnace closet with the HVAC running, the ANC immediately kicked in. And even with no music or sound playing, the furnace noise (I'd guess about ~50dB) just... *disappeared*. I literally had to take them out and put them back in a few times to see if I was going a bit bonkers. But not only did that sound disappear, but my tinnitus\u2014a group of between five and seven tones of various frequencies between 4kHz - 8/9kHz that has a perceived volume of about 40dB all the time\u2014suddenly had its volume \"turned down\" by about 10-15dB.\nIt was rather startling.\nI've heard those tones from the age of 17 on (I'm now 57). Incessantly. Unforgivingly. Perpetually.\nFor them to get quieter was pretty amazing.\nI suspect that the Active Noise Cancellation is at play here. If you're not aware, AirPods have microphones built into them. The main, obvious ones, are the little sticks that come off them outside your ears that listen to the environment around them. But there is a second set of microphones that detect the sounds *inside your ear canal when the buds are in them* that are likely the heroes here. The buds take both of those sound profiles (technically, it's *four* sound signatures\u2014two for each ear) and then uses machine learning combined with Apple's H2 chip to create \"anti-noise.\"\nNow, anti-noise is nothing new: I mean, *that's how ANC works*. It's also nothing new to tinnitus sufferers, either. \"Noise generators\" have been around for decades. There are even apps available that allow you to pump white, gray, pink, brown, or other noise \"colors,\" or other environmental sounds (ocean waves, rain, fireplace crackling, etc) into your ears -via- buds throughout the day to \"mask\" tinnitus. Many people have decent luck with this kind of tinnitus self-treatment\u2014I never have.\nI suspect that it's the inner microphones (Apple is one of a handful of current makers that have this) that are really helping to effectively mask the sound that gets past the bud seals, combined with (love 'em or hate 'em) Apple's crazy level of R&D that gets these buds to analyze not only the environmental noise profile *outside* the buds, but the sound that *gets past the buds*. This winds up being a broader noise profile, so the buds generate a broader palate of anti-noise, and then puts it *right in your ear*.\nNow to be clear, I can still hear my tinnitus tones. They're just less present in the... what? *\"auditory mix\"* in my head. But boy oh boy is the change noticeable. At least for now. It may be that in time my ears get used to the trick. But as of right now? I'm fine with being fooled.\nIt may be that other buds with ANC also do this, but I can't speak to any other solutions except the comparison to my -Labs. I get nothing if you buy these or any other buds. This is just my experience, but as someone who's lived with this affliction for so long, ANY positive change is important enough for me to take time, write down, and share my experience. YMMV.\nIf you have tinnitus, or hearing problems (or suspect you might) these are a serious consideration."

I\u2019ve been using them daily for about a month now, and they\u2019re holding up really well. When they arrived, the box was slightly scuffed, which initially had me a little concerned\u2014but it was fully sealed, and the AirPods themselves were spotless and clearly brand new.\nThe sound quality is fantastic\u2014crisp highs, solid mids, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such tiny earbuds. I upgraded from the 2nd generation, and the difference in sound is noticeable\u2014especially with how much clearer and fuller the low end feels. If you're someone who cares about audio quality, these are a huge step up.\nThey fit super well in my ears, which was something I was nervous about at first. For reference, I used to use the standard wired Apple EarPods, and these fit almost identically\u2014so if those worked for you, these likely will too. I move around a lot throughout the day, whether I\u2019m cleaning, working out, cooking, or getting ready, and I haven\u2019t had them fall out once. Super secure and really comfortable\u2014even after a few hours of continuous use.\nBattery life has been great so far. I use them for around 4 to 6 hours a day, and usually just pop them back into the case once during that time. They charge really fast, and when I take them out again, they\u2019re fully charged and ready to go. I only have to charge the case every couple of days\u2014usually every 1 to 3 days depending on my usage\u2014and even on the second day without charging, the case still has around 30% left. Really impressive battery performance overall.\nThey\u2019re also super convenient for everyday use and perfect for travel because they\u2019re so compact. Just a heads-up though: their small size does mean they\u2019re easier to misplace, so I\u2019d recommend being extra careful when out and about.\nOne thing I do want to point out is that if you accidentally drop the case, the AirPods tend to pop out. That\u2019s my only real complaint. I\u2019d highly recommend getting a protective cover for the case\u2014not just to help with that issue, but also because it\u2019s a fun way to personalize them to your style.\nThe pairing process was seamless. They connected to my iPhone instantly, no hiccups or delays. The microphone works great too\u2014clear on calls, and no one\u2019s had any trouble hearing me. Phone call quality overall is excellent, and switching between music and calls is smooth and fast.\nAlso, the range is solid. I\u2019ve been able to move around my apartment without losing connection, even with a few walls in between. The case feels durable and high-quality\u2014not flimsy or cheap at all.\nAll in all, I\u2019m super happy with this purchase. I was a little nervous at first because of some mixed reviews I\u2019d seen, but I\u2019m glad I trusted my gut. These AirPods have exceeded my expectations. I\u2019d give them a 10/10\u2014honestly, probably a 10000000/10 if I could. Comfortable, reliable, great sound, and easy to use.

Read more about how we evaluate products.\nApple AirPods 4 review: Pro features for everyone\nThe H2 chip unlocks ANC and several convenient tools.\nWith a big redesign to the \u201cregular\u201d AirPods, Apple delivers two new models. Sure, they have a similar look, and share a few features, but the biggest change from the third-gen version is the addition of active noise cancellation (ANC) for an added cost. The AirPods 4 with ANC ($179) option has more to offer in terms of conveniences, but the overhaul has greatly benefitted the AirPods 4 ($129) too. Apple has given its entry-level AirPods extra power, while also offering an option between those and the most expensive earbuds in its arsenal. However, your AirPods choice may still come down to whether you prefer an open-wear design or a fully-closed fit.\nApple offers useful noise cancellation while keeping your ears open on the AirPods 4 with ANC. There are also a lot of Pro features available.\n- Improved sound quality\n- Better fit\n- Effective ANC\n- Lots of advanced features\n- No onboard volume controls\n- Not a great deal when AirPods Pro 2 are regularly on sale\n- No hearing protection features\nImproved sound quality and the introduction of some advanced features are the key additions on AirPods 4. Plus, the redesigned shape offers a better fit.\n- Improved fit and comfort\n- Better sound quality\n- Advanced features from pricier models\n- Still pretty affordable\n- No onboard volume controls\n- No ANC\n- No wireless charging\n- No Conversation Awareness\nDesign\nA key difference between the AirPods 4 and Apple\u2019s previous model of \u201cregular\u201d AirPods is the shape of the housing that goes into your ears. The company says it analyzed thousands of ear shapes and over 50 million data points generated by 3D modeling to refine the curves on this new set of buds. Specifically, Apple adjusted the edge of the lower counter and narrowed the overall width for a more secure and more comfortable fit for more people. The company also put the H2 chip in the stem, allowing for a more compact design and improving both airflow and acoustics.\nThe revised shape does indeed lead to a better fit for my ears. The AirPods 4 are more comfortable and stay in place better than their predecessor. I never once felt like they were going to fall out when I was moving around, unless I turned my head completely to the side to lay down. Open-fit earbuds typically don\u2019t feel the most secure in my ears, but these do, and one less worry contributed to a better overall experience wearing them. Of course, the most secure fit remains with the AirPods Pro.\nThere\u2019s a force sensor on the stem of the AirPods 4. On both models, you can use that to control music, take calls and summon Siri. Of course, hands-free access to Apple\u2019s assistant is available on both models as well. And on the ANC set, you can long press on the stem to cycle through Noise Control modes (ANC and transparency).\nWhat you won\u2019t find here are onboard volume controls. On the AirPods Pro 2, you can slide your finger on the stem to adjust the level. That function is absent on the AirPods 4. Apple recommends you ask Siri to change the volume, use your iPhone\u2019s buttons, drag the slider on the Lock Screen player or swipe over to the Control Center. There\u2019s also the Digital Crown on the Apple Watch if you\u2019re on the Now Playing screen. Honestly, it\u2019s all a hassle. Siri is too slow and reaching for something that\u2019s not my earbuds just makes me mad. But, that hassle was there on the AirPods 3, so at least Apple is consistent.\nLooking at the earbuds themselves, you won\u2019t be able to tell the difference between the two versions of the AirPods 4. You can, however, tell them apart by looking at their cases. The ANC model has a speaker in the case to further assist Find My with beeps, so there are visible holes beside the USB-C port. On both AirPods 4, the LED indicator light is now hidden, so you don\u2019t see an extinguished dot when it\u2019s not on. What\u2019s more, Apple removed the back button for pairing and resetting the earbuds. Now, you\u2019ll double tap near the LED to put the AirPods 4 in pairing mode. And you\u2019ll double tap three times (six taps total) to trigger a reset.\nAirPods 4 features\nThe H2 chip from the AirPods Pro unlocks several notable advanced features on the AirPods 4. Sure, some of those are only available on the ANC model, but there are plenty of handy features on the $129 option. On that new entry-level set, you\u2019ll get Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking \u2013 immersive listening that\u2019s tailored to your hearing. The sound features also include 48kHz, \u201ccinema-quality\u201d audio for FaceTime and Adaptive EQ. And for calls, Apple\u2019s newly introduced Voice Isolation will offer some extra help when you\u2019re taking calls in less than ideal settings.\nThe last key piece is Siri Interactions, which allow you to accept or reject calls, respond or dismiss messages and engage or dismiss notifications. All of those are done with a nod or a shake of the head, so you\u2019re free to handle those tasks when you\u2019d rather not speak or can\u2019t reach your phone. And like everything else, you can disable them if you\u2019d rather do things the old fashioned way.\nThe AirPods 4 with ANC supports all those and then some. For $179, you\u2019ll also get Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, wireless charging and transparency mode. Adaptive Audio comes in handy when you encounter temporary environmental noise, like a coffee grinder or running water, as the tool automatically adjusts sound settings to maintain the overall listening experience. Conversation Awareness lends a hand for quick chats so you don\u2019t have to futz with the earbuds to participate. However, I still wish Apple would fully pause the audio rather than just lowering the volume. I find it distracting, and in some instances I felt I had to talk louder to project over sounds the other person couldn\u2019t hear. (Apologies to my coffee shop barista if I was shouting while I thanked you.)\nI\u2019ll also note that transparency mode and ANC go hand in hand, so it\u2019s not surprising that a feature to listen to ambient sound was omitted on the cheaper AirPods 4. And lastly, that case speaker on the ANC version will come in handy for Find My when you inevitably misplace the set. The ANC AirPods 4 case also only supports proximity view in Find My though, not the Precision Finding that AirPods Pro 2 offers.\nOf course, there are a few more mainstays from the AirPods lineup that return here. Audio Sharing with someone else wearing Apple or Beats earbuds or headphones is a great feature, as is automatic switching between Apple devices when you get a call or start playing music from your MacBook Pro instead of your iPhone. Both of the AirPods 4 are rated IP54 for moderate dust, sweat and water resistance \u2013 just like the AirPods Pro 2. And like that pair, that protection goes for both the earbuds and the case.\nSound quality\nApple equipped the AirPods 4 with a newly designed low-distortion 11mm driver and high dynamic range amplifier. The driver is built with a new membrane mesh as well as a new magnet, and overall, it has higher excursion \u2013 or distance the cone can travel. Importantly, Apple is able to offer better acoustic performance by directing the driver straight into the ear rather than positioning it off to the side. By doing this, the company has eliminated sound reflections that impacted overall clarity.\nThe \u201cricher bass, crisp highs and even more instrument separation\u201d are all claims that hold true when compared to AirPods 3. There\u2019s more low-end tone than the previous model right out of the gate, and the punchier treble opens the sound stage so it\u2019s wider and more immersive. The improved frequency response is on full display with Dolby Atmos content (movies, music and TV), but the AirPods 4 are also more sonically adept with non-spatial tunes and video.\nThat promised instrument separation is apparent on Tycho\u2019s synth-laden Infinite Health. Rather than seeming smashed together, the synths are all layered, reproducing the atmospheric soundscape the artist intended. Billy Strings\u2019 Live Vol. 1 isn\u2019t an Atmos album, but the AirPods 4 do an excellent job with the finer details of the live recordings. You get the reverb of the PA system, warmth of the upright bass and the subtle percussion in the bluegrass picking. The acoustic instruments stand on their own, with plenty of character studio tracks don\u2019t offer. And for bass-heavy styles, like Kaytrana\u2019s Timeless, the AirPods 4 have pleasant, thumping low-end that doesn\u2019t overpower. Vocals still cut through the mix, as does the rest of the electronic/hip-hop instrumentation.\nAudio performance is consistent on both sets of AirPods 4. Like I already mentioned, both are equipped with Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and Adaptive EQ. So, in terms of base sound performance, there are no sonic sacrifices between the two.\nANC performance on the AirPods 4\nActive noise cancellation on open-design earbuds is usually minimally effective. It\u2019s very difficult for the technology to provide the kind of relief from distractions you likely crave when your ears aren\u2019t sealed off with an ear tip. Apple isn\u2019t the first company to try this, but I\u2019d argue it is the first to offer a solution that actually makes a difference.\nApple employs the H2 chip and the same ultra-low-noise microphones from the AirPods Pro 2 to power the ANC setup on the AirPods 4. The primary goal is to reduce low-frequency noise, which means you\u2019ll notice the most impact on things like airplane cabin hum, HVAC systems and city traffic. The company promises you\u2019ll be able to listen to music and other media at lower volumes on the ANC model without distraction or sacrifices to audio quality, all thanks to this system.\nIt\u2019s not the world-blocking magic that Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM5 and other devices that seal off your ears offer, and it\u2019s not nearly as good as the AirPods Pro 2 either. But, for earbuds with an open-wear design, the difference when ANC is enabled is actually noticeable. The AirPods 4 struggle with TV noise and human voices, but they do well with constant, low rumbling distractions. On similar models I\u2019ve tested from other companies, active noise cancellation made little to no difference, and only served to drain the battery faster. If you\u2019re looking for something close to silence, the AirPods 4 won\u2019t give you that. However, the earbuds will deliver a noise reduction that will put a dent in raucous environments, and do so most effectively with low-frequency sounds.\nCall quality\nAirPods are popular options for hands-free calls, so Apple has improved how you sound when taking voice and video calls. Voice Isolation is an H2-powered tool that Apple says \u201cisolates and enhances your voice,\u201d and is a new feature for the AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2. Essentially, it removes background noise to keep you sounding your best when you\u2019re in loud environments.\nWith compatible AirPods, like the fourth-gen model, Voice Isolation is enabled by default for calls and FaceTime video, but you can turn it off in microphone settings on iOS, iPad and Mac. The feature also works with any third-party apps that use CallKit, like WebEx, Zoom, WhatsApp and more. Like the ANC, this is another impressive feat from Apple. Voice Isolation totally negates raucous fans, running water and other would-be distractions for the person on the other end. I did notice a very slight difference in overall voice quality, but it\u2019s a fair trade-off for sounding like you\u2019re in a silent room when you\u2019re not.\nThe AirPods 4 with ANC also have transparency mode, which is helpful for calls. This noise control setting pipes in the most natural ambient sound of any earbuds, just like the AirPods Pro 2.\nAirPods 4 battery life\nApple says you can expect five hours of battery life on both versions of the AirPods 4. With ANC active on the pricier model, you\u2019ll get one hour less of play time. Both of the AirPods 4 offer five charges in the case, which brings total usable time to 30 hours. Apple explains that all of its stated battery figures are at 50 percent volume with Spatial Audio off. For the ANC version, the company says the estimates also include disabling Conversation Awareness.\n50 percent volume won\u2019t be loud enough for most people on iOS, so I conducted my tests at around 70 percent there. Around 50 percent is good enough on Mac, though. Using a combination of those two settings across the devices, and employing a mix of both ANC and transparency mode while playing spatial audio and regular content, I got four hours out of the noise-canceling AirPods 4 with no problem. I had no issues hitting the stated figure on the non-ANC version either.\nAs a reminder, only the ANC version supports wireless charging. While that case will work with Apple Watch chargers, it doesn\u2019t support MagSafe accessories. If you find yourself in a pinch, both sets of AirPods 4 can offer an hour of use in five minutes.\nThe competition\nApple\u2019s main competition for the AirPods 4 is the company\u2019s other earbuds. The likes of Sony don\u2019t offer the deep iOS and macOS integration, which is a key selling point for any AirPods. That being said, the AirPods Pro 2 is the only other consideration if you\u2019re looking for another flavor of AirPods. The earbuds are two years old at this point, but the company is still adding new features. For example, AirPods Pro 2 is getting Voice Isolation and Siri Interaction today when iOS 18 drops. More importantly, Apple just got FDA approval for its Hearing Aid feature that will arrive alongside a Hearing Test tool this fall. Expanded Hearing Protection items are on the way as well.\nOf course, you\u2019ll get enhanced noise cancellation (with an ear tip seal) on AirPods Pro 2, and a transparency mode that handles your voice better. There\u2019s also two more hours of battery life over the ANC AirPods 4, a MagSafe-compatible case, Find My Precision Finding and, crucially, on-board volume controls. The second-gen AirPods Pro are available for $190 right now, and we\u2019ve seen them dip to $180 over the summer. If you can find them for the same price as the more expensive AirPods 4, you might want to go that route. I don\u2019t expect Apple will have a replacement before September 2025, so you don\u2019t have to worry about them becoming immediately obsolete if there\u2019s another hardware event next month or early next year.\nWrap-up\nWith the noise-canceling AirPods 4, Apple has bridged the gap between the entry level model and the AirPods Pro. The ANC version gets nearly all of what makes the AirPods Pro 2 so good, except for the most powerful noise cancellation, the upcoming hearing health features and a few other items. However, a $179 set of AirPods isn\u2019t a great deal right now with the AirPods Pro 2 available for nearly the same price if you catch them on sale. The $129 AirPods 4 is a big improvement over the previous version though, and they\u2019re a worthwhile update for fans of the basic, non-ANC formula. The question then becomes if you prefer the open design and can live without the Pro\u2019s extras. Both versions of the AirPods 4 have their merits, but for once, price won\u2019t be a deciding factor when choosing between two Apple products."

Please reload the page.\n- Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024Style: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseI\u2019ve tried several hearing aid substitutes over the years, my past favorite being the now unavailable Bose Hearphones and costing $500. Rather than just a sound amplifier, these had several functions allowing you to filter and focus sounds in various ways and for various situations. They were pretty good.\nBut now Apple has added some great features to their AirPods 2\u2014features that function like far more expensive hearing aids and at less than half the price of the Bose product. I\u2019ve owned these for a month or so and am now just getting the hang of how to use them. If there is a downside to these earbuds it is the rather deep and confusing tech included in them (or, at least confusing for a grandfatherly type like me). Once they are Bluetooth connected to your iPhone (They connect very easily with the button on the front of the EarPod\u2019s charging case.) they should automatically connect every time you put them in your ears. You will then be able to access all the functions by tapping the \u201csettings\u201d app on your phone. You will find a heading near the top of the list just below the box with your name and iCloud options. Tapping on this will allow you to drill down through several pages of options. There are a lot of options there and it can be confusing, but experimenting with the various functions will help you figure out their purpose.\nThe key here is to drill down to find the hearing test. This will quickly test for hearing loss by leading you through a series of tones of varying in pitch and volume. The end result will be an audiogram that can be used to program your EarPods as hearing aids. As stated before, it took me several weeks to find and activate this feature, but when I did a whole new experience dawned. Just be patient and search around for this function. It works very well.\nOf course, these things also serve as EarPods to listen to music or podcasts. (May I recommend \u201cPat Gray Unleashed!\u201d if your bent is conservative commentary and just plain fooling around). The quality of sound is phenomenal and the buds are more comfortable than most to keep in your ears for an extended time. To control the volume for this function you can TRY to use the external control buttons located on those silly looking stems that hang out of your ears (good luck) OR just open the \u201cControl Center\u201d page (slide one finger upward on your iPhone screen to access this page) where you\u2019ll find the volume slider. If your EarPods are connected and in your ears you\u2019ll see the slider is marked as controlling the AirPods.\nI really like these things now that I\u2019m a little more familiar with them. The quality and value are exquisite. If I discover more, I\u2019ll edit this comment.\n4 MONTHS LATER: Apple has improved the controls for these in their latest iOS update. The functions I had to dig around to find are now more easily accessed. Getting to the hearing test is now fairly straight forward.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2025Style: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseThe AirPods Pro 2.0 earbuds are very close to perfection. I have four pairs. Two with the lightning connectors, and two with the now standard USB-C connectors. My USB-C pairs have the Mag-Lock charging as well. The sound is awesome! There are earbuds with more bass and higher volumes. But I believe for recreating quality live sound the Airpods produce clear sound that rivals listening to live music. They put out a reasonable amount of bass. I don\u2019t honestly think that folks will be satisfied if you want ear shattering bass. The vocals are crisp. The battery life is pretty darn good too! Even the first pair that I purchased in 2023 still runs for at least 4.5 hours playing music. If the Airpods are totally dead, they\u2019re recharged in about an hour. With the different sized silicone eartips, they will comfortably fit in most ears. Plus when they wear out, you can purchase replacements on Apple\u2019s store, or right here on Amazon. I think one of the best features is the sound dampening ability. I usually have this feature on. I believe that even with no music playing the Airpods cut noise down by at least 50%-70%. You can have the microphones set to when you start talking, they let sounds through. I think the microphones are of wonderful quality. The clarity is really good. It is very rare that someone says they\u2019re having a hard time hearing me. About the only negative is they are susceptible to interference from other devices every once in awhile. This is more prevalent in the summer than in the cooler months. They are discounted now to $169.00! This is much better than paying $249 or even $199.

YMMV\u2026 So, for those of us crusty old codgers with beat up ears, here's an interesting discovery I made today:\nI (unsurprisingly) listen to a lot of stuff while working out in my shop. And as a DOACA (\"Dude of a Certain Age\") who worked as a roadie & stage tech in the age of Grunge, I have pretty pronounced tinnitus, so I'm doubly careful about my hearing when using some of my larger shop tools, like my cabinet saw, mill, etc, which means I'm often putting hearing protection on, and taking it off repeatedly. I have a decent \"bone conduction\" headset that allows for environmental awareness, but the protectors don't work with those on. I have tried a few wireless earbuds (most recently the well reviewed certain-Lab \u201cMini\u201ds) but there was some problem or other with all of them (the Minis sound great, but have terrible connectivity).\nSo I finally sucked it up and got a set of Apple AirPod Pro 2s (yeah, mostly after hearing Adam Savage rave about them in a recent video you can easily find.) An interesting thing about them is that Apple actually worked with the US FDA (for those of you not in America, that's the federal agency that regulates medical devices here in the States\u2014you need to be certified by them to make any medical claims about a product or device) and got these to be certified as Class II hearing aids in the US and Canada. And in addition to a clinical-grade hearing test feature included that runs in the app, the Hearing Aid feature is easy to employ, and actually useful. But that's not what has me so jazzed about these.\nAside from the Bluetooth being rather astounding (my wife took my phone to the other end of the house about 40' away, with our chimney stack between us, and stuck it in her sock drawer\u2014totally fine), the noise cancellation is *shockingly* good. And this is where things get interesting, and where we get back around to my tinnitus.\nPutting these in my ears this morning while sitting in my dining area, next to our furnace closet with the HVAC running, the ANC immediately kicked in. And even with no music or sound playing, the furnace noise (I'd guess about ~50dB) just... *disappeared*. I literally had to take them out and put them back in a few times to see if I was going a bit bonkers. But not only did that sound disappear, but my tinnitus\u2014a group of between five and seven tones of various frequencies between 4kHz - 8/9kHz that has a perceived volume of about 40dB all the time\u2014suddenly had its volume \"turned down\" by about 10-15dB.\nIt was rather startling.\nI've heard those tones from the age of 17 on (I'm now 57). Incessantly. Unforgivingly. Perpetually.\nFor them to get quieter was pretty amazing.\nI suspect that the Active Noise Cancellation is at play here. If you're not aware, AirPods have microphones built into them. The main, obvious ones, are the little sticks that come off them outside your ears that listen to the environment around them. But there is a second set of microphones that detect the sounds *inside your ear canal when the buds are in them* that are likely the heroes here. The buds take both of those sound profiles (technically, it's *four* sound signatures\u2014two for each ear) and then uses machine learning combined with Apple's H2 chip to create \"anti-noise.\"\nNow, anti-noise is nothing new: I mean, *that's how ANC works*. It's also nothing new to tinnitus sufferers, either. \"Noise generators\" have been around for decades. There are even apps available that allow you to pump white, gray, pink, brown, or other noise \"colors,\" or other environmental sounds (ocean waves, rain, fireplace crackling, etc) into your ears -via- buds throughout the day to \"mask\" tinnitus. Many people have decent luck with this kind of tinnitus self-treatment\u2014I never have.\nI suspect that it's the inner microphones (Apple is one of a handful of current makers that have this) that are really helping to effectively mask the sound that gets past the bud seals, combined with (love 'em or hate 'em) Apple's crazy level of R&D that gets these buds to analyze not only the environmental noise profile *outside* the buds, but the sound that *gets past the buds*. This winds up being a broader noise profile, so the buds generate a broader palate of anti-noise, and then puts it *right in your ear*.\nNow to be clear, I can still hear my tinnitus tones. They're just less present in the... what? *\"auditory mix\"* in my head. But boy oh boy is the change noticeable. At least for now. It may be that in time my ears get used to the trick. But as of right now? I'm fine with being fooled.\nIt may be that other buds with ANC also do this, but I can't speak to any other solutions except the comparison to my -Labs. I get nothing if you buy these or any other buds. This is just my experience, but as someone who's lived with this affliction for so long, ANY positive change is important enough for me to take time, write down, and share my experience. YMMV.\nIf you have tinnitus, or hearing problems (or suspect you might) these are a serious consideration."

I\u2019ve been using them daily for about a month now, and they\u2019re holding up really well. When they arrived, the box was slightly scuffed, which initially had me a little concerned\u2014but it was fully sealed, and the AirPods themselves were spotless and clearly brand new.\nThe sound quality is fantastic\u2014crisp highs, solid mids, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such tiny earbuds. I upgraded from the 2nd generation, and the difference in sound is noticeable\u2014especially with how much clearer and fuller the low end feels. If you're someone who cares about audio quality, these are a huge step up.\nThey fit super well in my ears, which was something I was nervous about at first. For reference, I used to use the standard wired Apple EarPods, and these fit almost identically\u2014so if those worked for you, these likely will too. I move around a lot throughout the day, whether I\u2019m cleaning, working out, cooking, or getting ready, and I haven\u2019t had them fall out once. Super secure and really comfortable\u2014even after a few hours of continuous use.\nBattery life has been great so far. I use them for around 4 to 6 hours a day, and usually just pop them back into the case once during that time. They charge really fast, and when I take them out again, they\u2019re fully charged and ready to go. I only have to charge the case every couple of days\u2014usually every 1 to 3 days depending on my usage\u2014and even on the second day without charging, the case still has around 30% left. Really impressive battery performance overall.\nThey\u2019re also super convenient for everyday use and perfect for travel because they\u2019re so compact. Just a heads-up though: their small size does mean they\u2019re easier to misplace, so I\u2019d recommend being extra careful when out and about.\nOne thing I do want to point out is that if you accidentally drop the case, the AirPods tend to pop out. That\u2019s my only real complaint. I\u2019d highly recommend getting a protective cover for the case\u2014not just to help with that issue, but also because it\u2019s a fun way to personalize them to your style.\nThe pairing process was seamless. They connected to my iPhone instantly, no hiccups or delays. The microphone works great too\u2014clear on calls, and no one\u2019s had any trouble hearing me. Phone call quality overall is excellent, and switching between music and calls is smooth and fast.\nAlso, the range is solid. I\u2019ve been able to move around my apartment without losing connection, even with a few walls in between. The case feels durable and high-quality\u2014not flimsy or cheap at all.\nAll in all, I\u2019m super happy with this purchase. I was a little nervous at first because of some mixed reviews I\u2019d seen, but I\u2019m glad I trusted my gut. These AirPods have exceeded my expectations. I\u2019d give them a 10/10\u2014honestly, probably a 10000000/10 if I could. Comfortable, reliable, great sound, and easy to use.

The battery life is amazing and lasts like a week. They lag sometimes but that also could be my slow Wi-Fi. The design is nice and fits in my ear well but if you sleep with them they are likely to fall out. The function is fine. They are easy to travel with and it\u2019s nice listening to Spotify on the airplane. I kinda just bought them because Apple is a name brand. I really like the sound quality though when you listen to music with both AirPods in it sounds like you\u2019re at a concert."
