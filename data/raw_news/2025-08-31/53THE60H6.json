  "title": "The Health Of Latinos And Its Socioeconomic Importance To The U.S.",
  "description": "A healthy Latino population is vital to social and economic fabric of the U.S. Continuation of these essential contributions is dependent on a healthy Latino population",
  "content": "Understanding the health of Latinos is vital due to their significant contributions to America\u2019s social and economic fabric. Latinos have the highest labor force participation rate and are driving increases in college enrollment, homeownership, and consumer spending. Those continued contributions to the nation\u2019s socioeconomic vitality are dependent on a healthy Latino population. At the same time, the health of this vital population is often not as good as it should be, due to factors such as income, employment, the cost of health insurance and care, environmental issues, and policies that cut or reduce public resources for healthcare.\n\nThe Health Of Latinos And Health Insurance\n\nThe story of Latinos\u2019 health is best understood through the lens of health care insurance, costs, and access for all Latinos. A 2024 report from the non-partisan Commonwealth Fund found that 55% of Latinos aged 19-64 are not adequately insured, compared to 42% of the non-Latino population. The highlighted that Latinos are either uninsured (16%), have gaps in coverage (18%), or have insurance with out-of-pocket expenses that make it virtually unusable (21%).\n\nThe report also found that due to care costs, 52% of working-age Latinos faced difficulties accessing health care, including not being able to fill a prescription (28%), skipping tests, treatment, or follow-up care (37%), not visiting a doctor (39%), or forgoing necessary specialty care (33%).\n\nOne Latina, who asked to remain anonymous to protect her identity, said in an interview, \u201cI work long hours, I am tired, do not feel good, and cannot afford to go to the doctor. I need to work, my family needs the money, and I just live with feeling sick a lot. I can\u2019t afford to be sick or to even find out why I am sick.\u201d\n\nThe Health Of Latinos And Income\n\nIncome, environment, and occupation are key factors that significantly influence health. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Latinos have the lowest per capita income among major racial and ethnic groups. Per capita income provides a snapshot of individual economic well-being and overall economic conditions. Being healthy is costly, accessing healthcare is costly, prevention and treatment for health are expensive, and for far too many Latinos, these are expenses they cannot afford. During a community conversation, a Latino who wished to remain anonymous to protect his identity said, \u201cI have a hard time paying the rent, I cannot afford luxuries like going to the doctor because I do not feel well.\u201d\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, immigrant Latinos are healthier than Latinos born in the United States. Since most Latinos are native-born, their health status is generally poorer compared to non-Latino populations and immigrant groups. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that about 12% of Latino adults have diabetes, which is 41% higher than among white adults.\n\nThe American Lung Association states that while Latinos have the lowest rates of cigarette smoking among racial and ethnic groups, their living, working, and childhood environments pose disproportionate risks to their lung health. The United States Environmental Protection Agency found that regardless of geographic region or income, exposure to air pollution is higher among people of color, including Latinos. The study\u2019s lead author, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Professor Christopher Tessum says, \u201cSome assume that when there is a systematic racial-ethnic disparity, such as the one we see here, that the underlying cause is a difference in income. Because the data shows that the racial disparities hold for all income levels, our study reinforces previous findings that race/ethnicity, independently of income, drives air pollution-exposure disparities.\u201d\n\nDuring a community forum, a Latina mother, who asked to remain anonymous to protect her privacy, said she was concerned about where her children play and the bad smells in her neighborhood, saying, \u201cThe playground near our house is dirty and dusty and only a block away from a factory. Sometimes, when we are sitting outside, the smell from the factory makes it hard to breathe, and you feel sick.\u201d She added that she and others have complained, but nothing has been done, and she wonders, \u201cAm I making me and my kids sick by where I live?\u201d\n\nA disproportionate number and percentage of Latinos work in physically demanding jobs that place excessive stress on their bodies. These jobs, whether indoors or outdoors, expose workers to toxic substances and pollution. Occupational risks for death, disability, and disease are common among Latinos. For example, a recent report from the AFL-CIO shows that Latino workers are more likely to die on the job than other groups. Additionally, the number of Latinos dying on the job has increased by 44% since 2003. Furthermore, anywhere from 5 to 9% of working Latinos are exposed to substances such as metals, solvents, and pesticides, which contribute to overall health declines.\n\nSpecial Consideration Should Be Paid To The Maternal Health of Latinas\n\nIn addition to understanding the broad health care issues facing Latinos, Dr. Melissa Simon, a Professor and the Vice Chair for Research in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Northwestern University, highlights why significant attention should be paid to the maternal health and welfare of Latinas. \u201cWhile the data show that maternal mortality rates are decreasing for Latinas, the real crisis for Latina maternal health is the Medicaid cuts. Medicaid covers about 6 out of 10 births to Hispanic women. With mounting social, economic, and immigration pressures on Latinas, combined with care cuts, these maternal mortality rates are likely to rise. Given the declining fertility replacement ratio in the U.S., which reflects the country\u2019s health, and considering that Latinas make up about 25-26% of all births in the U.S., the Trump administration and each of us should be concerned about the likely further harmful impact of Medicaid cuts on prenatal care for all women, especially Latinas, since these cuts are likely to lower the fertility replacement ratio further rather than improve it.\u201d\n\nElected officials and all of us must recognize that health policies need to address access to and affordability of healthcare, as both are essential for the nation's well-being. Moreover, daily living conditions, such as economic, environmental, or occupational hazards, should be incorporated into the development of health policies. Additionally, all health policies should be assessed with particular attention to their impacts on Latinos. This focus on the Latino community is justified because of the significant disparities they face in access to healthcare and health outcomes, as well as their vital contributions to population growth and the economy.",

      "text": "Study Finds Exposure to Air Pollution Higher for People of Color Regardless of Region or Income\nPublished September 20, 2021\nIn the United States, people of color breathe more particulate air pollution on average, a finding that holds across income levels and regions of the US, according to a study by researchers at the EPA-funded Center for Air, Climate, and Energy Solutions. The findings expand a body of evidence showing that African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and other people of color are disproportionately exposed to a regulated air pollutant called fine particulate matter (PM2.5).\nThe findings, published in April 2021 in Science Advances, have serious public health implications\u2013exposure to PM2.5 can cause lung and heart problems, especially for those with chronic disease, younger people, older people, and other more vulnerable populations.\nThe researchers conducted modeling and analyzed EPA data from the National Emissions Inventory for more than 5,000 emission source types for PM2.5 such as industry, agriculture, light- and heavy-duty vehicles, construction, residential sources, and road dust to determine which source(s) were causing inequal exposure to PM2.5 pollution by race-ethnicity.\nThey found racial-ethnic disparities for nearly all major emission categories. White people are exposed to lower than average concentrations from emission source types causing 60 percent of overall exposure, whereas people of color experience greater than average exposures from source types causing 75 percent of overall exposure. The disparity generally held across states and urban and rural areas and occurs for people at all income levels.\nIn other words, the study found that race appears to be an important factor for exposure in nearly all regions.\n\u201cSome assume that when there is a systematic racial-ethnic disparity, such as the one we see here, that the underlying cause is a difference in income,\u201d says lead author Christopher Tessum of the University of Illinois. \u201cBecause the data shows that the racial disparities hold for all income levels, our study reinforces previous findings that race/ethnicity, independently of income, drives air pollution-exposure disparities.\u201d\nTessum said the results have implications for how regulations might be designed to effectively address environmental injustice for people of color exposed to air pollution from multiple source types.\n\u201cWe find that nearly all emission sectors cause disproportionate exposures for people of color on average,\u201d said co-author Julian Marshall, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Washington. The authors noted in the paper that because of a legacy of housing policy and other factors, racial-ethnic exposure disparities continue to persist even with a decrease in the overall exposure.\n\u201cThe inequities we report are a result of systemic racism: Over time, people of color and pollution have been pushed together, not just in a few cases but for nearly all types of emissions,\u201d said Marshall.\nThe study results also comes with caveats including uncertainty in the models and in inputs to the models and notes the potential benefit of additional analysis using local data and expertise. In addition, the study focuses on outdoor concentrations at locations of residence; disparities in associated health impacts would also reflect racial-ethnic variability in mobility, microenvironment, outdoor-to-indoor concentration relationships, dose-response, access to health care, and baseline mortality and morbidity rates.\nEPA's goal is to provide an environment where all people enjoy the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards and equal access to the decision-making process to maintain a healthy environment in which to live, learn, and work. To help achieve this, EPA researchers are focused on understanding the air quality concerns in overburdened communities and the health impacts of the residents. They are providing scientific expertise and tools to assist states, tribes, and communities to address issues, so that all people can breathe clean air and enjoy improved quality of life.\nThis research was funded by an EPA Science to Achieve Results grant: https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.abstractDetail/abstract_id/10614\nReference:\nTessum, C.

      "text": "Public parks and school playgrounds hold a uniquely vital role in the Hispanic and Latino communities. These precious green spaces, most weekends and holidays filled with vibrant colors, lively music and diverse cuisines, are often a primary place for kids to experience their culture. Attending multigenerational events with my Mexican-American extended family shows me the important interplay between those relatives new to the country and those quite old in it.\nAt these events, I\u2019m far more likely to focus on what\u2019s happening at the park instead of why it\u2019s located next to a busy highway. Unfortunately, parks can be dangerous places for children of color because of polluted air. A study released this year by Harvard University reinforced what experts have known for some time, that air pollution in predominantly Latino zip codes is 14% higher than predominantly white areas for fine particulate matter and other contaminants. In fact, over the two decades examined in the study, fine particle levels decreased in white areas and either remained constant or increased in Latino communities. Disproportionate exposure to air pollution in communities of color is linked to premature death, childhood asthma attacks and a host of other chronic and debilitating health conditions.\nWhy Children Are More at Risk\nThe Lung Association\u2019s 2022 \u201cState of the Air\u201d report notes that children are both more susceptible and likely to be exposed to harm from air pollution than adults. The growth and development of a child\u2019s lungs and breathing ability start in utero and continue into early adulthood. Exposure to air pollution at any stage of that development process can have both immediate and lasting impacts on developing lungs and children\u2019s health. In addition, the body\u2019s defenses that help adults fight off infections are still developing in children. This may be why children have higher rates of respiratory infections, which may lead to shortness of breath or rapid breathing, particularly in polluted air.\nThe presence of unacceptably high levels of air pollution at the school playgrounds and parks in Hispanic and Latino neighborhoods is exacerbated by myriad of socio-economic factors. While community partners can and should make use of daily online air quality warnings, simply staying inside is often not a viable solution. Children spend more time at school than many other places, often transported by diesel buses, and receive a significant amount of their physical activity enjoying recess. They are more likely to spend time outdoors, running around, being active and breathing hard, consequently exposing them to harm.\nWhen not in school, the importance of neighborhood parks to Latino children and communities cannot be understated providing space for informal community convening and facilitating familial connections.\nHow Latino Communities Are Disproportionately Exposed\nNationwide, much of the harmful air pollution concentrated in Hispanic and Latino neighborhoods is tied to the transportation industry. Trucks, trains, naval shipping, and heavy construction equipment are far more likely to operate near school playgrounds and parks in communities of color. The National Institutes of Health has determined that children and adolescents of color are more likely to develop asthma than their white counterparts and Department of Transportation studies have shown that people living adjacent to highways, supply-chain hubs and industrial areas will suffers worse medical outcomes, including higher rates of cancer, than their more affluent neighbors.1 The American Lung Association\u2019s \u201cZeroing in on Healthy Air\u201d report highlights a critical part of the solution to discriminatory environmental injustice as the transition to zero-emission transportation and electricity generation by 2050.\nAnother contributor to the health threats facing these communities is the prevalence of western wildfires. Wildfires contribute additional particle pollution and other air pollution on top of that caused by the burning of fossil fuels like gas and diesel. Latino groups are disproportionately affected by smoke due to their significant populations in California, Arizona, Colorado and Nevada where the fires are particularly intense.\nWhile Hispanic and Latino Americans proudly enjoy the lowest smoking rates of any other group in our nation, air pollution poses disproportionate risks to lung health. Whether or not a person has health coverage and access to linguistically and culturally appropriate health information may influence their overall health status, and how they are impacted by environmental stressors like air pollution. Also, there is increasing evidence that non-physical stressors such as poverty, racial/ethnic discrimination and fear of deportation can amplify the harmful effects of air pollution.\nHow Can You Make a Difference\nIt\u2019s time to start working to improve the health and chances of success for Latino children. Actions at the local and state level can begin to have a significant impact on reducing air pollution around the places kids play. Tell your local school districts to convert their school buses to zero emission. Also, tell your elected officials to adopt the Advanced Clean Trucks Rule in your state. Getting the dirtiest old trucks off the road and replacing them with zero-emission options can help clean the skies in your neighborhood. Finally, Latino school-age children deserve to enjoy the fullness of nature and trees and vegetation have been shown to clean the air and lower temperatures, so you can also support urban planting projects, especially near where they play.\nBlog last updated: August 23, 2023"
