      "feedback": "Strong starting point, but to reach world‑class quality for a 3–6 month horizon you should (a) codify a formal catalyst map anchored to WISLWAJ15, with near‑term triggers and clear invalidations tied to AbbVie/Abbott/Pfizer events (LOEs for Eliquis/Ibrance/Xeljanz; pipeline milestones for Cibinqo, Elrexfio, Padcev; FDA/regulatory updates; and any shifts in dividend policy), (b) specify explicit timing windows and path dependence (0–2 weeks for quarterly data, 1–3 months for LOE/pipeline milestones, 3–6 months for regulatory/pipeline readouts) and show how outcomes feed valuation and income, (c) ground the analysis in first‑principles dividend sustainability by quantifying cash‑flow coverage (ABBV trailing FCF of about $18.2B vs ~\\$11.3B in dividends; ABBV payout >100% indicating sensitivity to FCF), Abbott’s 53‑year dividend growth, Pfizer’s 6.7% forward yield and 8.3x forward P/E, and explicitly link these to the near‑term dividend trajectory, (d) replace generic framing with a base case plus 1–2 explicit alts that include numerical return targets or price ranges and their drivers, (e) harden the risk/invalidation framework with concrete thresholds (e.g., if FCF payout coverage <80% or dividend growth <2% for two consecutive quarters, or LOEs accelerate beyond a stressed scenario, reprice the thesis), (f) enlarge the watch‑list to 6–8 concrete signals—regulatory dates, LOE schedules, pipeline milestones, quarterly FCF growth, dividend announcements, and pertinent macro/policy shifts—and (g) ensure every assertion is tied to the single source ID (WISLWAJ15) and address any conflicts between yields vs. growth narrative by reconciling the dividend safety with pipeline/FCF dynamics, ending with a tight base case, 1–2 actionable alts, clearly stated risks, watch‑list signals, and a concise confidence level.",
