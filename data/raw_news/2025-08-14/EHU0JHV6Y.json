Generate Key Takeaways\n\nLanguage interpreters for Washington state\u2019s labor agency sued last year alleging they were owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in missed payments.\n\nMore than a year later, they say the issue still hasn\u2019t been resolved.\n\nWhen they filed suit, the interpreters for the state Department of Labor and Industries alleged they were owed more than 3,500 payments, ranging from $6 to $494, totaling $280,000, dating back to 2021. The unpaid work continues to \u201cpile up\u201d for language access providers, according to a spokesperson for their union, Interpreters United.\n\nSpecifically, these interpreters serve those injured while working for an employer that is self-insured and does not participate in Washington\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system. Such companies must pay for medical services, including interpretation assistance, needed after workplace injuries.\n\nSelf-insurance allows the employers, including companies like Walmart, Costco and Tyson as well as some local school districts, to exert more control over workers\u2019 compensation claims.\n\nThe Department of Labor and Industries still manages the claims. It contracts with an outside company to handle the scheduling and paying of interpreters for self-insured claims. Until June 2024, that company was InterpretingWorks, which is named as a defendant in the ongoing wage theft lawsuit. Last year, L&I switched to SOS International, or SOSi.\n\nSelf-insured employers are required to compensate the interpreters through the outside company that acts as a middleman. The union is pushing Labor and Industries to pressure those firms to pay up.\n\n\u201cL&I has the authority and obligation to require self-insured companies to pay the compensation owed to LAPs, but has failed, refused, and neglected to do so,\u201d reads last year\u2019s lawsuit filed in Thurston County Superior Court.\n\nLabor and Industries spokesperson Matt Ross said the agency has \u201cthe same goal as the interpreters: We want to see them get paid what they are owed.\u201d\n\nSome interpreters don\u2019t want to work with the agency any more.\n\n\u201cI used to do a lot of interpreting for injured workers for L&I, but stopped doing it for over a year now,\u201d union president Quan Tran said in a statement.\n\nBarbara Robertson, a Swahili interpreter, said it\u2019s \u201cutterly ironic that the agency that investigates and litigates wage theft does not guarantee that interpreters will be paid.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m not inclined to interpret again for a client whose insurer hasn\u2019t paid me,\u201d she said.\n\nRoss, from L&I, said in an email, \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to find a resolution for those cases\u201d where interpreters haven\u2019t been paid.\n\nThe agency\u2019s new vendor, SOS International, has also contracted with the federal government to provide interpreters for immigration court proceedings. In 2017, the National Labor Relations Board found SOSi had misclassified those interpreters as independent contractors, enabling the Virginia-based company to avoid giving them benefits like overtime pay.\n\nA SOSi spokesperson said the company is \u201ccommitted to ensuring we meet our obligations to pay interpreters in accordance with the terms of our contract with the State.\u201d The company wasn\u2019t named as a defendant in last year\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\nRoss said since changing vendors interpreters are being paid on time.\n\n\u201cThe number of interpreters providing services for workers has also more than doubled, from 254 last June to 520 today,\u201d he said Wednesday.\n\nInterpretingWorks CEO Marisa Gillio said if interpreters didn\u2019t get paid, \u201cneither did we.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven after our contract ended over a year ago, we\u2019ve continued processing invoices and ensuring interpreters are paid as soon as the funds come in,\u201d Gillio said in a statement.\n\nThe contract interpreters for Labor and Industries had long fought for union representation. Last year, they secured their first contract with the state. It provides a 5% pay increase in the current two-year state budget. The union represents about 1,400 interpreters who work with state government, including L&I and other agencies, said spokesperson Patrick Sugrue.",

      "text": "Interpreters play a vital role in immigration courts \u2014 but their rights are being violated, labor board says\n- Share via\nThe company tapped by the federal government to provide interpreters in immigration court wrongly classified employees as independent contractors and fired those who spoke out, the National Labor Relations Board said in a complaint issued Wednesday.\nThe complaint alleges that SOS International, also known as SOSi, misclassified workers and engaged in unfair labor practices under the National Labor Relations Act, including coercion and retaliation. By misclassifying workers, SOSi circumvented labor laws that would require it to pay overtime and to provide certain benefits, such as workers\u2019 compensation.\nThe NLRB\u2019s complaint marks the first time a federal agency has recognized the contract interpreters as employees.\n\u201cAt a time when the climate is not union friendly, this is a major victory,\u201d said Hilda Estrada of Los Angeles, an interpreter who accused SOSi of retaliation. \u201cI\u2019m elated.\u201d\nThe Justice Department \u2014 which in 2015 awarded a contract to SOSi for up to five years and a maximum of $80 million \u2014 declined to comment on contract interpreters\u2019 employment status. Kathryn Mattingly, a spokeswoman for the department, said SOSi was selected in a competitive process based on \u201ctechnical evaluation and the best value to the government.\u201d\nSOSi, based in Reston, Va., said in a statement before the NLRB filed its complaint that subcontracting interpreters \u201cis not a new practice\u201d and that the views of \u201cthe small handful of disgruntled interpreters who have filed protests in various venues do not represent \u2026 the majority of qualified professional interpreters.\u201d\nThe case, which now goes to a hearing before an administrative law judge of the NLRB, will affect hundreds of interpreters who work in immigration courts nationwide. Those courts are currently saddled with a backlog of 585,000 cases, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, and they are set to become even busier as President Trump pursues an agenda of mass deportation.\nInterpreters play a crucial role in immigration court cases: Only 11% of such cases were completed in English in 2015, according to a Justice Department report.\nThough the department directly employs 65 interpreters to staff immigration courts, the vast majority \u2014 about 700 \u2014 are subcontracted by SOSi. The contractors who complained to the NLRB said they should have been classified as employees because SOSi controlled the means and manner in which they worked \u2014 a key test in determining whether a worker is an employee.\n\u201cI had no freedom at all,\u201d said Patricia Rivadeneira, 61, formerly a Spanish interpreter for SOSi. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can be an independent contractor when you are ordered to be in at a certain time. You cannot leave when you\u2019re ready to leave .\u2026You were told which restrooms to use. You were told how to dress. You were told you had to wear a badge. You were told you could not even say good morning to anybody.\u201d\nThe distinction between employee and contractor is \u201cthe dividing line between benefits applying to you and obligations being met by your employer, and essentially no legal protections or mandated benefits,\u201d said Seth Harris, a former secretary of Labor under President Obama.\nEmployers are legally required to pay workers\u2019 compensation and unemployment insurance premiums for their employees, adhere to minimum wage and overtime laws, and allow employees to organize and seek remedy from discrimination. In some circumstances they must provide health insurance and family leave, and they often offer paid time off, vacation and retirement benefits.\nIn general, there are no such requirements for contractors.\nThat a federal contractor is accused of skirting the law is particularly outrageous, Harris said. \u201cYou expect companies that are doing business with the federal government \u2014 and carrying out important government functions, getting paid with taxpayer money \u2014 would be held to a higher standard,\u201d he said.\nSOSi was not the first company commissioned by the Justice Department to provide interpreters that treated them as contractors. But some say it committed the worst offenses \u2014 and that\u2019s why they took up a fight.\nRivadeneira, for example, had worked in immigration court since 2002. She said she worked 4\u00bd days a week, first at Mira Loma Detention Center in Lancaster and later at Adelanto Detention Center, earning $60 per hour, with a guaranteed minimum of two hours\u2019 pay for each assignment.\nThough Rivadeneira relied on Medi-Cal for health insurance and never took vacation, she was able to support herself and her husband and rent a two-story house in Lancaster. But when SOSi took over the contract and offered her $35 an hour, with no guaranteed minimum, Rivadeneira balked.\n\u201cThe wage was so low that it was not worth my time,\u201d she said.\nRivadeneira and others began organizing and eventually negotiated a higher flat rate. They went to work for SOSi starting in December 2015. After that, Rivadeneira continued to organize, collecting interpreters\u2019 names, passing out fliers about their rights and trying to form a union \u2014 activities that cost her her job nine months later, according to the complaint.\nRivadeneira is not the only one. The Times spoke to five other interpreters who alleged retaliation, coercion and unfair discharge, and a lawyer for the interpreters said that as many as 40 directly participated in the NLRB action.\n\u201cWe treated our jobs as full-time jobs,\u201d said Diana Ilarraza of Los Angeles, who became an interpreter in 1999 and said she was retaliated against for complaining about not being paid on time. \u201cIt was very hard and disheartening for us to see our careers go away just like that \u2014 it was a loss of dignity.\u201d\nThe complaint names nine employees, including Estrada and Rivadeneira, who were allegedly terminated because of their organizing activities. It also alleges that SOSi interrogated and threatened employees over these activities, conducted surveillance, and ordered them not to communicate with one another or the media about the company or their work.\nNot all of the interpreters who work for SOSi are dissatisfied.\nRamesh \u201cRay\u201d Shrestha, a Nepali interpreter based outside San Francisco, travels weekly for SOSi, earning a flat day rate of $500 each time. He said he likes the flexibility and pay, which give him time to spend with his wife and two kids.\nShrestha has one advantage Spanish interpreters do not: He speaks what is known as an \u201cexotic\u201d language and could not be easily replaced. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a huge pool of Nepali interpreters,\u201d he said. \u201cI do have more negotiating power.\u201d\nThe dispute has had an effect in the courts. Ten immigration attorneys and one judge interviewed for this report said the quality of interpretation in immigration court has suffered since SOSi took over the contract, citing anecdotal evidence of no-shows and poor-quality interpretations as the ranks of veteran interpreters have thinned.\nHelen Sklar, an attorney based in Los Angeles, said she flew to Miami in January for a hearing that had been scheduled months earlier, only to find out the case couldn\u2019t go forward because there was no Spanish interpreter. \u201cNo Spanish. In Miami,\u201d she said in disbelief.\nAccording to Justice Department data, in 2016 \u2014 the first full year for which SOSI provided interpreters nationwide \u2014 2,457 hearings were adjourned due to interpreter no-shows. That number was up from 1,101 in 2015, when SOSi was being phased in, and 512 in 2014, when a different company, Lionbridge Technologies, held the contract.\nNot having an interpreter disrupts court cases and causes costly delays. It also wears on clients.\n\u201cEvery time they come to court they lose a school day, they lose a day of work, they pay for parking. Their friends and family come. And then finally they give up,\u201d Sklar said. \u201cThey stop asking their family and friends to come \u2014 and then they don\u2019t have witnesses.\u201d\nAttorneys also cited examples of interpreters who summarized rather than interpreted complete sentences, or interpreters who used the wrong word \u2014 such as \u201cfirearm\u201d instead of \u201cassault rifle,\u201d \u201cbeaten\u201d instead of \u201ckilled,\u201d \u201cinconvenient\u201d instead of \u201cnot in my best interest.\u201d\nThose distinctions matter in immigration court, where a single inconsistency in a claim can mean the difference between staying in the U.S. and getting deported.\n\u201cNuance is everything,\u201d said Dana Marks, a veteran judge in San Francisco and president of the National Assn. of Immigration Judges. \u201cIf things are said in different ways at different times, that can be an interpreter\u2019s fault, and yet, it makes the person look not credible.\u201d\nNot only must interpreters render testimony in a second language in real time, they must convey the class, education level, emotion and authority of the speaker, requiring a wide range of vocabulary.\nMany of the interpreters who had those skills have left immigration court since SOSi took over the contract, Marks said. But now that the NLRB has said they are employees who have the right to organize for better pay and working conditions, they hope to return.\n\u201cI plan to go back to work as soon as possible,\u201d Estrada said.\nTwitter: @AgrawalNina"
