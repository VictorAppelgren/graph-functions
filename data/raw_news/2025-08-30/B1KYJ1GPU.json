  "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) today is down by -0.74%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) is down by -0.43%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is down by -1.28%. September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are down -0.74%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are down -1.24%.\n\nStock indexes are moving lower today, weighed down by weakness in technology stocks. Marvell Technology is down more than -16% to lead semiconductor stocks lower after reporting that Q2 data center revenue missed estimates. Also, Dell Technologies is down more than -8% to lead computer hardware stocks lower after reporting tighter profit margins on AI servers.\n\nStocks added to their losses after the August MNI Chicago PMI fell more than expected and after the University of Michigan\u2019s US August consumer sentiment index was unexpectedly revised lower. Also, inflation pressures remain sticky after the US July core PCE price index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, rose by the most in five months.\n\nOn the positive side for stocks, US consumer demand remains resilient after July personal spending rose by the most in four months. Also, the University of Michigan\u2019s inflation expectations were unexpectedly revised lower. In addition, Autodesk is up more than +7% after reporting stronger-than-expected Q2 net revenue and forecasting Q3 revenue above consensus.\n\nUS July personal spending rose +0.5% m/m, the most in four months and right on expectations. July personal income rose +0.4% m/m, right on expectations.\n\nThe US July core PCE price index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high of +2.9% y/y from +2.8% y/y in June, right on expectations but well above the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target.\n\nThe US Aug MNI Chicago PMI fell -5.6 to 41.5, weaker than expectations of 46.0.\n\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s Aug US consumer sentiment index was revised lower by -0.4 to 58.2, weaker than expectations of no change at 58.6.\n\nThe University of Michigan Aug 1-year inflation expectations were unexpectedly revised slightly lower by -0.1 to 4.8%, weaker than expectations of an upward revision to 5.0%. The Aug 5-10 year inflation expectations were revised lower by -0.4 to 3.5% from the previously reported 3.9%.\n\nDovish comments late Thursday from Fed Governor Christopher Waller were supportive of stocks, as he stated that he supports a 25-bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months. He said, \u201cWith underlying inflation close to 2%, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, and the chances of an undesirable weakening in the labor market increased, proper risk management means the FOMC should be cutting the policy rate now.\u201d\n\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump late Monday threatened to impose new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology and semiconductors in retaliation against other nations\u2019 digital services taxes that hit American companies. Last week, Mr. Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect last Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit.\n\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on August 13 extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India\u2019s purchases of Russian oil. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 89% at the next FOMC meeting on September 16-17. The markets are discounting the chances at 52% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\n\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With Q2 earnings season winding down, over 95% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\n\nOverseas stock markets today are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 fell to a 2-week low and is down -0.49%. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.37%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.26.\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU5) today are down -3 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is up +2.1 bp to 4.225%.\n\nSep T-notes are under pressure today after the US July core PCE price index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, rose to a 5-month high of +2.9% y/y. T-notes also have carryover pressure from weakness in 10-year German bunds after the German Aug CPI rose more than expected.\n\nLosses in T-notes are limited after Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he supports a 25 bp rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and anticipates additional rate cuts over the next three to six months. Also, the University of Michigan\u2019s Aug inflation expectations were unexpectedly revised lower, a dovish factor for Fed policy.\n\nEuropean government bond yields today are moving higher. The 10-year German bund yield is up +1.9 bp to 2.714%. 10-year UK gilt yield is up +2.1 bp to 4.720%.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s July 1-year CPI expectations remained unchanged from June at +2.6%, which is stronger than the expected +2.5%. The ECB Jul 3-year CPI expectations unexpectedly climbed to +2.5%, stronger than expectations of no change at +2.4%.\n\nGerman Aug unemployment unexpectedly fell by -9,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of +10,000.\n\nGerman Jul retail sales fell -1.5% m/m, weaker than expectations of no change and the biggest decline in almost two years.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\n\nChipmakers are under pressure today, led by a -16% plunge in Marvell Technology (MRVL) to lead losers in the Nasdaq 100 after it reported Q2 data center revenue of $1.49 billion, below the consensus of $1.52 billion. Also, Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX) are down more than -4%, and Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are down more than -3%. In addition, ARM Holdings Plc (ARM), ASML Holding NV (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA Corp (KLAC), and Micro Technology (MU) are down more than -2%.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) is down more than -8% to lead losers in the S&P 500, and makers of computer hardware are lower after reporting Q2 operating income of $2.28 billion, below the consensus of $2.30 billion. Also, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is down more than -5% and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is down more than -2%.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) is down more than -4% to lead losers in the Dow Jones Industrials after warning that it faces a larger-than-anticipated tariff headwind of as much as $1.8 billion this year.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) is down more than -5% despite reporting better-than-expected Q2 net sales after it warned of a potential pullback by consumers.\n\nIonQ Inc. (IONQ) is down more than -3% after filing for a potential offering of up to 12.4 million shares of its stock by multiple shareholders.\n\nDollar General (DG) is down more than -2% despite reporting better-than-expected Q2 EPS after it said it expects \u201cmore pressure\u201d in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses in Q3 and warned of tougher gross margin comparison in Q4.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) is up more than +7% to lead gainers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after reporting Q2 net revenue of $1.76 billion, better than the consensus of $1.72 billion, and forecasting Q3 revenue of $180 billion-$1.81 billion, stronger than the consensus of $1.77 billion.\n\nAmbarella (AMBA) is up more than +17% after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of 15 cents, well above the consensus of 6 cents, and raising its 2026 revenue growth estimate to 31%-35% from a May forecast of +19%-25%.\n\nAffirm Holdings (AFRM) is up more than +12% after reporting Q4 revenue of $876.4 million, well above the consensus of $838.6 million.\n\nSentinelOne (S) is up more than +4% after raising its 2026 revenue forecast to $998 million-$1 billion from a previous forecast of $996 million-$1 billion.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) is up more than +4% after PepsiCo increased its stake in the company to approximately 11% on an as-converted basis and will nominate an additional director to serve on Celsius Holdings\u2019 board of directors.",

New delayed trade updates are updated on the page as indicated by a \"flash\".\nBarchart Symbol Notes Tutorial (8:43)\nQuoteboard data fields include:\n- Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session.\n- Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram.\n- Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session.\n- Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.\n- YTD High, Low, Change, %Change: The high and low price year-to-date, with the change and percent change year-to-date.\nChart Snapshot\nA thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.\nPrice Performance\nThis section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the \"See More\" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.\nOptions Overview\nHighlights important summary options statistics to provide a forward looking indication of investors' sentiment.\n- Implied Volatility: The average implied volatility (IV) of the nearest monthly options contract that is 30-days or more out. IV is a forward looking prediction of the likelihood of price change of the underlying asset, with a higher IV signifying that the market expects significant price movement, and a lower IV signifying the market expects the underlying asset price to remain within the current trading range.\n- 30-Day Historical Volatility: The average deviation from the average price over the last 30 days. Historical Volatility is a measurement of how fast the underlying security has been changing in price back in time.\n- IV Percentile: The percentage of days with IV closing below the current IV value over the prior 1-year. A high IV Percentile means the current IV is at a higher level than for most of the past year. This would occur after a period of significant price movement, and a high IV Percentile can often predict a coming market reversal in price.\n- IV Rank: The current IV compared to the highest and lowest values over the past 1-year.

Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy.\nThe Opinion will show on the Quote Overview Page for all asset classes with this exception: For all U.S. Stocks, the Market Cap must be greater than $1B.\nA symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:\n- Strong Buy (greater than \"66% Buy\")\n- Buy (greater than or equal to \"33% Buy\" and less than or equal to \"66% Buy\")\n- Weak Buy (\"0% Buy\" through \"33% Buy\")\n- Hold\n- Strong Sell (greater than \"66% Sell\")\n- Sell (greater than or equal to \"33% Sell\" and less than or equal to \"66% Sell\")\n- Weak Sell (\"0% Sell\" through \"33% Sell\")\nThe current reading of the 14-Day Relative Strength Index is also factored into the interpretation.

Historical Volatility is a measurement of how fast the underlying security has been changing in price back in time.\n- IV Percentile: The percentage of days with IV closing below the current IV value over the prior 1-year. A high IV Percentile means the current IV is at a higher level than for most of the past year. This would occur after a period of significant price movement, and a high IV Percentile can often predict a coming market reversal in price.\n- IV Rank: The current IV compared to the highest and lowest values over the past 1-year. If IV Rank is 100% this means the IV is at its highest level over the past 1-year, and can signify the market is overbought.\n- IV High: The highest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- IV Low: The lowest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- Put/Call Vol Ratio: The total Put/Call volume ratio for all option contracts (across all expiration dates).
