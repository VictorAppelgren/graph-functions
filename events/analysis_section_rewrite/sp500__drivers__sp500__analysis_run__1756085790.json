      "feedback": "Strong macro backbone and clear cross‑asset signals are the piece’s core strengths (ETH 4,000–5,000; BTC ~110k–125k; Ford EV metrics; RWA ~16T by 2030; Treasury tokenization ~$4.2B in 2025; oil regime numbers; 2025 revenue midpoint ~\\$900m; gross margin around the 4% area), but the draft needs a tighter, fully wired causal chain, complete Regime structuring, and explicit, source‑anchored watchpoints. Edit to (1) hardwire a first‑principles causal map: inflation path → Fed policy reaction function → discount rates and risk premia → crypto/AI infrastructure valuations, citing the same sources (e.g., OGK8WLL69; JPAIHPA4N; SGB2PAZGK) for each link; provide a minimal model or Sensitivity/Elasticity note rather than hand‑waving. (2) Align with SECTION FOCUS by delivering a single, explicit cross‑topic synthesis map: macro/inflation path, policy regime transitions, flows/positioning (RWA, tokenization, crypto inflows), and valuations/technicals, with each node tied to a source ID. (3) Complete the scenario structure: fix the truncated Regime B/Regime C line, supply a clean A/B/C definition, add explicit triggers (CPI momentum, wage growth, Jackson Hole signals, semiconductor capex cadence, crypto inflows) and clear invalidation points; optionally assign rough probability weights (e.g., A, B, C bands) tied to cited text. (4) Fortify quantification: repair incomplete numbers (e.g., confirm gross margin value; keep Ford Q2 metrics as given; retain 2025 revenue midpoint \\$900m; 16T RWA; \\$4.2B tokenization; 4k–5k ETH; 110k–125k BTC; Brent mid‑60s/WTI low‑60s) and ensure every factual claim has a source tag; avoid vague ranges that aren’t sourced. (5) Elevate citation discipline: attach the exact IDs to the corresponding claims, reconcile any conflicts (oil Regime A ~50% vs Regime B ~30% probabilities; crypto/subsection data), and ensure critical sources (OGK8WLL69; JPAIHPA4N; SGB2PAZGK; J99EM2TPZ; T1QE6JPIX; 22PL3Q360; Y6SQOEK69) cover the major assertions. (6) Fix drafting flaws and clarity: remove truncations (the “und” fragment); replace generic phrasing with concrete, sourced statements; and tighten prose so each sentence advances the causal narrative. (7) Add a decisive, compact watch‑list of signals (three to five items) with crisp thresholds and event windows (CPI momentum prints; policy guidance at Jackson Hole; semiconductor capex cadence timings; crypto inflow milestones; RWA/custody progress milestones). (8) Highlight fragility and flip points: specify what would derail the base path (e.g., hotter inflation delaying easing, energy shock sustaining higher oil, slower crypto/custody progress) and what signal would flip the view, with corresponding source anchors. This will yield a world‑class, fully sourced, quantitatively anchored, Regime‑aware narrative with a concrete watch‑list.",
