The Nasdaq dropped 1.5% and the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) fell 1.4%, led lower by weakness in the mega-cap semiconductor and software stocks. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) lost 1.6%, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) declined 2%, the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductor Index gave back 3%, the DJ U.S. Software Index was off 2%, and the iShares Tech-Software ETF (IGV) sank 2.6%. Many of the beloved IT names were whacked, including NVDA, AVGO, TSM, AMD, ARM, MSFT, ORCL, and PLTR, which all fell 1.4% to 9.4%. The QQQ as well as the SOXX and the SMH closed at or near their 21-day exponential moving averages. The software indices broke below their 50-day averages for the first time since early this year and broke down from short-term topping formations. In addition, the highflying (mostly IT) IPOs from 2025 were smacked hard. On the flipside, five of the 11 S&P 500 sectors rose between 0.6% and 1.8% -- and they were mostly defensive areas. Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Utilities led with gains of 1% to 1.8%, while Healthcare and Materials gained 0.6%. As of this writing, the QQQ has traced out multiple bearish divergences with respect to the daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) and there has been one divergence with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI). Volume was above average, creating a second distribution day. For big trouble, we need to see four to five days of heavy selling in a 10-day period.

In the US, same-store sales rose 1.4%, the third straight quarter that this measure saw year-over-year gains.\nCEO Ted Decker told analysts on Tuesday the company exited the second quarter with same-store sales rising 3.3% over the prior year in July; May's and June's increases were each less than 1%.\nTicket growth for the second quarter was up 1.4%, while transaction growth fell slightly, due to higher-priced goods like lumber and copper and a decrease in promotional activity.\nTickets worth over $1,000 were up 2.6% compared to the second quarter of 2024, executive vice president of merchandising Billy Bastek told investors on the earnings call.\nHe added, \"We continue to see softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund the renovation project.\"\nFor the second quarter, Home Depot reported revenue of $45.27 billion, versus the $45.41 billion expected, per Reuters.

It simply doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s cozying up to Xi Jinping, is what it\u2019s doing.\u201d\nA Chinese official voiced support for India regarding US tariffs on its exports, highlighting growing cooperation between the two Asian neighbors.\n\u201cThe United States has imposed tariffs of up to 50% on India, and it has even threatened for more. China firmly opposes this,\u201d said China\u2019s ambassador to India, Xu Feihong.\nOn Thursday, the US and the EU established a written framework for the trade deal agreed to on July 27. The terms include a 15% US tariff on most EU imports: These include autos, pharmaceutical goods, semiconductors, and lumber \u2014 but not wine and spirits.\nThe two sides also outlined the EU's promise to remove tariffs on US industrial goods and give better access to US seafood and agricultural products.\nOn Wednesday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the US is content with its current tariff setup with China, signaling the Trump administration wants stability ahead of the November trade truce deadline.\nIn a Fox News interview, Bessent said the status quo is \"working pretty well\" and called China the biggest source of tariff revenue.\nBessent went on to add in a further interview with CNBC that he expects tariff revenues under President Trump to exceed his earlier $300 billion estimate, with the money going to pay down the federal debt rather than rebate checks for Americans.\nEarlier this month, Trump unveiled \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of US trade partners (which you can see in the graphic below).\nThe biggest negotiations to watch in the coming months are Canada, Mexico, and China.\nHere are the latest updates as the policy reverberates around the world.\nLIVE1729 updates\nJenny McCall\nPostal services to stop sending low-cost parcels to US as duty exemption ends\nGlobal postal services are going to stop parcel deliveries to the US ahead of President Trump's deadline to end a tax exemption that allowed businesses to avoid import tariffs on small packages.\nCountries such as Sweden and Norway have already made the move to stop sending low-cost packages to the US.\nNavarro slams India again over Russian oil as 50% tariffs loom\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro has blasted India again for continuing to buy Russian oil and said he expects punitive tariffs of 50% on imports from the South Asian nation to kick in as planned next week.\nNvidia tells partners to halt work on H20 chip for China\nNvidia (NVDA) has told suppliers including Samsung (005930.KS) and Amkor (AMKR) to halt production of its H20 AI chip after Beijing urged firms to avoid the processor, according to a report in the Information. The move raises doubts over demand as Chinese buyers shift to Huawei and Cambricon (688256.SS).\nThe suspension adds pressure to US chipmakers and could complicate trade talks, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang saying any successor for China will hinge on US approval.\nTariffs are giving parents back-to-school sticker shock\nAs the summer holidays come to an end and children head back to school, parents are getting a nasty surprise when they check price tags for kids clothing due to President Trump's sweeping tariffs.\nWalmart CEO: Tariff impact has been 'gradual,' but we expect costs to increase\nWalmart (WMT) reassured investors that it's continuing to gain market share and generate healthy sales growth.\nBut even though executives said the company didn't see any \"dramatic shifts\" with consumer behavior last quarter, they did communicate that keeping costs low could become a greater challenge in the second half of the year as tariff-related price increases work their way through inventory.\n\"With regards to our US pricing decisions, given tariff-related cost pressures, we're doing what we said we would do: We're keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Walmart's earnings call.\n\"The way things have played out so far, the impact of tariffs has been gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments by the customer have been somewhat muted,\" McMillon continued. \"But as we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we've continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters.\"\nEconomic impact of US tariffs will be key for US rating\n(Reuters) \u2013 S&P Global Ratings' decision to affirm its U.S. credit rating reflected the impact of tariff revenues, but questions remain on the economic outcome of U.S. trade policies that could influence the country's rating in the next few years, the primary analyst on the U.S. said.\nS&P on Monday affirmed its \"AA+\" credit rating on the U.S., saying the revenue from President Donald Trump's tariffs has the potential to offset the fiscal hit from his massive tax-cut and spending bill. S&P, which became the first ratings agency to cut the pristine U.S. government rating in 2011, said the outlook on the U.S. rating remains stable.\n\"Outcomes are what's really going to weigh and inform the rating,\" Lisa Schineller, primary U.S. analyst at S&P Global Ratings, said in an interview.\n\"The outcomes of how you execute the budgetary legislation, how the tariff revenue comes, their combined impact on growth and investment that leads to either better or worse or similar fiscal out-turns, that's our focus,\" she said.\nEU-US trade deal does not include wine and spirits\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) \u2013 The EU-U.S. trade deal does not include wine and spirits, European Union Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said on Thursday, adding that the door was not closed to tariff reductions for the sector and others not included in the deal. ...\n\"This one we didn't get in. But I can tell you that there is clear commitment from the European Commission to put it on the table\", Sefcovic said, referring to wines and spirits.\nUS, EU lock in trade deal; US official sees auto tariff relief in weeks\nThe US and the EU on Thursday finalized a framework trade deal reached last month. The agreement keeps US tariffs on most EU imports, including autos, chips, pharmaceuticals and lumber.\nIn a joint statement, the two sides outlined their commitments. The EU pledged to remove tariffs on all US industrial goods and give preferential market access to a range of US seafood and agricultural products.\nChina turns against Nvidia\u2019s AI chip after \u2018insulting\u2019 Howard Lutnick remarks\nBeijing has restricted sales of Nvidia's (NVDA) China specific AI chip after US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made comments officials found \"insulting.\"\nChinese regulators, which include the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), are now trying to discourage domestic tech firms from buying the H20 processor.\nSouthwire praises copper tariffs it says will help US companies\nPresident Trump's tariffs may have rattled markets and nations alike, but one group have applauded Trump tariffs saying that adding import duties on aluminum and copper products will help American manufacturers.\nEU says draft joint statement on trade and tariffs sent back to US\nThe European Commission said it has sent back the US draft joint statement on trade and tariffs, with talks on going between top officials.\nWhile the EU and US agreed on a trade framework in July, only a 15% baseline tariff has been implemented so far, and Brussels is waiting for Washington to issue executive orders on sectors such as the auto industry."

      "text": "Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nMortgage rates barely budged today. According to Zillow, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is up one basis point to 6.53%, while the 15-year rate is down by a single basis point to 5.69%. While rates are calm, it might be a good time to lock in a mortgage rate.\nDig deeper: Mortgage rate predictions for the next five years\nToday's mortgage rates\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to our latest Zillow data:\n-\n30-year fixed: 6.53%\n-\n20-year fixed: 6.24%\n-\n15-year fixed: 5.69%\n-\n5/1 ARM: 6.84%\n-\n7/1 ARM: 6.81%\n-\n30-year VA: 6.07%\n-\n15-year VA: 5.53%\n-\n5/1 VA: 6.05%\nRemember that these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\nToday's mortgage refinance rates\nThese are the current mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n-\n30-year fixed: 6.59%\n-\n20-year fixed: 6.23%\n-\n15-year fixed: 5.89%\n-\n5/1 ARM: 7.19%\n-\n7/1 ARM: 6.70%\n-\n30-year VA: 6.04%\n-\n15-year VA: 5.54%\n-\n5/1 VA: 5.75%\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Refinance rates are usually higher than purchase rates.\nRefinance interest rates\nYahoo Finance mortgage calculator\nA mortgage calculator can help you see how various mortgage term lengths and interest rates will affect your monthly payments. Use this mortgage calculator to play around with different outcomes.\nThe Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when calculating your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n30-year vs. 15-year fixed mortgage rates\nAs a general rule, 15-year mortgage rates are lower than 30-year mortgage rates. When comparing 15- versus 30-year mortgage rates, know that the shorter term will save you money on interest in the long run. However, your monthly payments will be higher because you\u2019re paying off the same loan amount in half the time.\nFor example, with a $400,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.53% rate, you'll make a monthly payment of about $2,530 toward your mortgage principal and interest. As interest accumulates over decades, you\u2019ll end up paying $513,000 in interest.\nIf you get a $400,000 15-year mortgage with a 5.69% rate, you\u2019ll pay about $3,300 monthly toward your principal and interest. However, you\u2019ll only pay $195,585 in interest over the years.\nIf that 15-year mortgage monthly payment is too high, remember you can always make extra mortgage payments on your 30-year loan to pay off your mortgage faster and ultimately pay less interest.\nFixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages\nWith a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in from day one. However, you will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage.\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a set period of time. Then the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remainder of your term.\nAdjustable rates sometimes start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, you risk your interest rate going up. ARM rates have also been starting higher than fixed rates recently, so sometimes you don't get a rate break.\nDig deeper: Adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage \u2014 Which should you choose?\nWhen will mortgage rates finally drop?\nEconomists don't expect drastic mortgage rate drops before the end of 2025.\nIn 2024, mortgage rates trended downward from early August to the Sept. 18 Federal Reserve meeting, when the central bank announced a 50-basis-point slash to the federal funds rate. Since that announcement, mortgage rates have mostly increased or held steady.\nThe Fed decreased its rate again at its November and December meetings (by 25 bps each time). The trajectory of future mortgage rates will largely depend on the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on whether or not to cut the federal funds rate at its September meeting.\nThe Fed has not cut its rate at any of its 2025 meetings so far, including its July 30 meeting. Currently, the CME FedWatch tool predicts an 83% chance that the rate will decrease at the Fed's meeting in September. Mortgage rates may or may not react to a Fed short-term interest rate cut. However, a sudden financial setback \u2014 such as high inflation \u2014 could change that.\nDig deeper: Understanding the Fed's rate decisions \u2014 Do we want high or low interest rates?\nMortgage rates today: FAQs\nWhat is today's 30-year fixed rate?\nAccording to Zillow data, today's 30-year fixed rate is 6.53% for home purchases and 6.59% for refinances. These are the national averages, so keep in mind the average in your state or city could be different. Your rate will also vary depending on your personal finances.\nAre mortgage rates expected to drop?\nMortgage rates aren't expected to move much by the end of 2025. Even with a fed funds rate cut in September, other financial factors are likely to keep rates steady.\nWill mortgage rates go down in 2026?\nMortgage rates might ease a bit lower next year. Depending on the economy, inflation, and the Fed, any decreases may be relatively small."

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that the U.S. economy generated just 73,000 nonfarm jobs in July, well below our forecast of 112,000. The consensus was 110,000. June's payrolls were revised lower by 133,000 and May by 125,000. The July result and the revisions reduced the three-month average to 35,000 from a solid 150,000 before the report. The BLS Diffusion Index indicated 51.2% of 250 private industries are hiring, up from 47.2% in June. Manufacturing slumped to 43.8% from 48.6%. The July unemployment rate increased to 4.2%. Average hourly earnings increased 12 cents month to month and are 3.9% higher year over year. The average workweek rose by 0.1 hour to 34.3 hours. Employment showed little change in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction; construction; manufacturing; wholesale trade; retail trade; transportation and warehousing; information; financial activities; professional and business services; leisure and hospitality; and other services. The manufacturing sector lost a disappointing 11,000 jobs. Healthcare and social assistance added 73,300. Federal government employment fell by 12,000, and the decline of 84,000 since January is still below 292,000 federal layoffs announced this year, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The BLS reiterated that employees on paid leave or receiving ongoing severance pay are counted as employed in the establishment survey. After the report, stock futures were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury plunged by 13 basis points to 4.27%. Based on futures trading, the probability that the Fed will cut the funds target at its September meeting jumped to 66% from 41%. The probability that funds target will be 3.75%-4.0% or lower after the December meeting rose to 71% from 43%.\nThe Argus Min Vol Model Portfolio\nUncertainty over President Trump's new tariff policies almost knocked stocks into a bear market earlier this year.

It offers a wider range of items and smaller pack sizes than Costco and Sam's. The company posted total revenue of $20 billion in FY25, which ended on February 1, 2025. As of 1Q26, income from membership fees represented 2.3% of total revenue and 59% of operating income. The company sells name-brand merchandise and food to members, who are small business owners and consumers. Based in Westborough, Massachusetts, the company also offers specialty services, including tire installation, optical services, and photo developing. At the end of fiscal 1Q26, the company operated 255 BJ's clubs and 190 gas stations in 21 states. More than half of the clubs are in four states: New York, Florida, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. About 23% of FY25 sales were generated in the New York City metro area (down from 25% in FY21 and FY20). Clubs range from 43,000 to 177,000 square feet. BJ's sells a relatively narrow assortment of approximately 7,000 SKUs, which it has discussed trimming to about 6,000 to improve inventory turnover. Groceries represented 71% of the company's FY25 net sales (70% in FY24, 67% in FY23, 71% in FY22); general merchandise and services accounted for 11% in FY25, 11% in FY24, and 12% in FY23 and 14% in FY22. Gasoline rose to 21% in FY23 from 15% in FY22 and 9% in FY21. Gas was 19% of sales in FY24 and 18% in FY25. A predecessor company, BJ's Wholesale Club, traded as a public company until it was acquired on September 30, 2011, by an investor group led by Leonard Green & Partners and CVC Capital. On July 2, 2018, the company again went public as BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings on the NYSE. CVC and Leonard Green held no shares when the company published its FY21 annual report. The company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. The convention at Argus, Bloomberg, and other data service providers is to number the fiscal year based on the calendar year in which it ends. BJ's current fiscal will end on January 31, 2026. We thus call the current year FY26 while the company calls it FY25. The just completed year had 52 weeks.

      "text": "On Monday, KB Home (KBH) reporteda 17% drop in net orders from the year-earlier period for its fiscal first quarter ending Feb. 28. The company also dialed down its average selling price range for 2025 to $480,000 to $495,000. In January, it expected a range of $488,000 to $498,000.\nShares of KBH fell 4% in after-hours trading following the earnings report.\n\"While longer-term housing market conditions remain favorable, driven by demographics and an undersupply of homes, demand at the start of the spring selling season has been more muted than we have seen over the past few years,\" KB Home CEO Jeffrey Mezger told analysts and investors on the earnings call.\nMany real estate agents and builders consider Super Bowl weekend, which landed on Feb. 8-9 of this year, to be the unofficial kickoff for the peak homebuying and selling season, which lasts through early June.\nMezger noted that the company typically sees a pickup in net orders in late January and early February. This season, that did not materialize, reflecting the hesitancy among buyers to purchase a home.\nAs a result, KBH lowered its guidance for 2025 housing sales to $6.60 billion to $7 billion from its previous forecast of $7 billion to $7.5 billion.\nOverall, sales of new single-family homes rebounded slightly in February amid warmer weather and falling mortgage rates. But it's unclear if the momentum will last.\n\"If the builders can figure out what leverage to pull from an affordability standpoint, the buyers and the demand are out there, but it's not going to be as easy as it was,\" Wedbush Securities senior vice president of equity research Jay McCanless told Yahoo Finance in an interview.\nThis challenge is not unique to KB Home. The second-largest homebuilder, Lennar, reported a slight 1% increase in net new orders from the year-earlier period, totaling 18,355. However, the company projected lower-than-expected quarterly orders due to the tough housing market.\nWhen it reported Q1 results last week,Lennar (LEN) forecast new orders between 22,500 and 23,500 for its second fiscal quarter, lower than analysts' estimate of 23,800 homes. While mortgage rates have decreased slightly, they are still hovering around 6.7%, prompting the builder to reduce its average sales price, after incentives, to $408,000 in the quarter, marking a 1% decline from last year.\n\"During the quarter, as we move past the beginning of February, we do not see the seasonal pickup typically associated with the beginning of the spring selling season,\" Lennar CEO Jonathan Jaffe told analysts and investors on the earnings call.\nConsequently, Evercore ISI analyst Stephen Kim downgraded Lennar to In Line from Outperform, with a price target of $131, down from $159, following the fiscal first quarter report. The downgrade was driven by the second quarter gross margin guidance of 18%, which fell below expectations, with management attributing the decline to increased incentives compared to the first quarter.\nEvercore ISI argues that Lennar's strategy to sustain incentive volume will result in its profitability \"at dramatically depressed levels,\" Kim wrote.\nTo address affordability, builders may need to adjust home sizes, limit options, or \"find other ways to skinny the price,\" McCanless said. For example, they might replace more extensive home plans with smaller ones, such as swapping 2,500-2,600-square-foot plans for 1,700-1,800-square-foot alternatives.\nAnother concern for builders is President Trump's executive order, effective in April, imposing tariffs on construction materials from Canada and Mexico. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) warns that this could raise the cost of imported materials by over $3 billion, with builders estimating an average rise of $9,200 per home.\nThis growing pressure is contributing to increased uncertainty among smaller builders, who are becoming concerned about the housing market's outlook.\nWolfe Research highlighted this concern in its recent survey of private builders, noting that while orders increased by about 22% month over month in January, this growth was well below the typical 39% average seen in recent years. Smaller builders' confidence also took a hit in February, reflecting a three-point drop from January to its lowest level in seven months.\n\"At this point, for them to be able to drive much better demand without sacrificing margin, it's going to likely have to come in the form of lower mortgage rates or people regaining their confidence in the macroenvironment and in their employment situation, which both those parts are really out of builder's hands,\" Trevor Allinson, director and senior research analyst at Wolfe Research, told Yahoo Finance.\nD.R. Horton (DHI), the nation's biggest homebuilder, is slated to report its fiscal second quarter earnings on April 17.\nDani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @daniromerotv."

That helped counter slowing demand for smartphones.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n-\nWhy New York City Has a Fleet of New EVs From a Dead Carmaker\n-\nChicago Schools Seeks $1 Billion of Short-Term Debt as Cash Gone\n-\nTrump Takes Second Swing at Cutting Housing Assistance for Immigrants\n-\nA Photographer\u2019s Pipe Dream: Capturing New York\u2019s Vast Water System\n-\nA London Apartment Tower With Echoes of Victorian Rail and Ancient Rome\nXiaomi has previously described ambitions to go global, though it\u2019s never specified a target market. While Europe is a common destination for Chinese EV makers seeking to tap a more lucrative arena, considering they can often sell their cars with higher margins there, they do face punitive tariffs.\nWere Xiaomi to export its EVs to Europe, it would likely be subject to tariffs of up to 48%, including a base 10% import duty and additional countervailing levies of around 35% to 38%. Those measures were imposed by the European Union in response to what it deems unfair state subsidies provided to Chinese EV makers, which the bloc argues distorts market competition and threatens local manufacturers.\nChinese EV makers also face tariffs of 100% if they want to sell their cars in the US. That\u2019s effectively shut them entirely out of the market.\nRead: Europe Warms to China\u2019s Investments in Face of US Tariffs\nRegardless, strong demand for the YU7 sport utility vehicle, which co-founder Lei Jun released at the end of June, is propelling Xiaomi\u2019s $10 billion gamble on the increasingly crowded EV arena. The company aims to become one of the world\u2019s top five carmakers within 15 to 20 years, despite a production crunch that\u2019s testing its ability to scale up. Wait times for the SUV have stretched to more than a year.\n\u201cThe business model we have developed in China can also apply in overseas market when we get into Europe,\u201d Lu told analysts on a call. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the research and preparation.

      "text": "By Dan Burns\n(Reuters) -Groundbreaking for new U.S. single-family homes and permits for future construction ticked higher in July even as high mortgage rates and economic uncertainty continued to hamper home purchases, while overall residential construction was buoyed by a surge in new apartment projects.\nShop Top Mortgage Rates\nSingle-family housing starts, which account for the bulk of homebuilding, increased 2.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 939,000 units last month, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said on Tuesday. Permits for future single-family homebuilding edged up 0.5% to a rate of 870,000 units, snapping a four-month skid.\nOverall residential construction starts jumped 5.2% to a rate of 1.428 million units on the back of a second month of double-digit increases in apartment projects. Groundbreaking for multi-family projects of five or more units rose 11.6% to an annual rate of 470,000 units, the highest level since May 2023. New apartment construction, which had been in a protracted downtrend after peaking in 2022, has jumped more than 50% in the last two months.\nHow long that resurgence continues remains in question, though, as total permit issuance - a guide for future activity - fell 2.8% to a five-year low of 1.354 million units, led by a nearly 10% drop in multi-family project permits. Economists polled by Reuters had estimated housing starts would fall to an annual rate of 1.290 million and permits would dip to an annual rate of 1.386 million units.\nHIGH MORTGAGE RATES\nPresident Donald Trump's sweeping import tariffs have kept the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates this year, with most central bank policymakers wary of easing borrowing costs until they have more confidence the levies will not rekindle inflation, which has yet to return to the Fed's 2% target.\nRecent indications of softening in the job market, however, have largely convinced investors that the Fed will cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point when it meets in mid-September, and that expectation has helped bring down mortgage rates in recent weeks.\nThe average rate on the popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the most common U.S. home loan, fell to 6.58% last week, the lowest level since October, data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac showed. That rate is down by nearly half a percentage point since January.\nStill, mortgage rates are well above the levels that prevailed in the years just before and through the COVID-19 pandemic, and that change along with high home prices has kept a lid on demand. The slump in demand has increased the supply of homes on the market, discouraging builders from breaking ground on new housing projects. New housing inventory is near levels last seen in late 2007. A National Association of Home Builders survey on Monday showed more than a third of builders are cutting prices to attract buyers."

In the US, same-store sales rose 1.4%, the third straight quarter that this measure saw year-over-year gains.\nCEO Ted Decker told analysts on Tuesday the company exited the second quarter with same-store sales rising 3.3% over the prior year in July; May's and June's increases were each less than 1%.\nTicket growth for the second quarter was up 1.4%, while transaction growth fell slightly, due to higher-priced goods like lumber and copper and a decrease in promotional activity.\nTickets worth over $1,000 were up 2.6% compared to the second quarter of 2024, executive vice president of merchandising Billy Bastek told investors on the earnings call.\nHe added, \"We continue to see softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund the renovation project.\"\nFor the second quarter, Home Depot reported revenue of $45.27 billion, versus the $45.41 billion expected, per Reuters. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $4.68, $0.04 less than the expected $4.72.\nFor the second time this year, Home Depot reiterated its annual forecast, saying it expected net sales to grow by 2.8% and same-store sales to increase by 1% for the full fiscal year.\nRead more: Live coverage of corporate earnings\nDecker told investors on Tuesday, \"The momentum that began in the back half of last year continued throughout the first half as customers engaged more broadly in smaller home improvement projects.\"\nCFO Richard McPhail said the retailer has its eyes on the interest rate cut widely expected to come soon. But it is still waiting to see whether the cut will affect the borrowing rates that matter to consumers, such as mortgage rates, he told Yahoo Finance.\n\"They [rates] are still quite elevated, relative to recent history, and we know that is leading our customers to defer large projects,\" he said. \"It's hard to say what rates may have to do to unlock that spend on large projects, but our customers do tell us they're deferring, they're not canceling. So either rates decrease, or we all get used to this as a new normal.\"\nRead more: Best credit cards for home improvement in 2025\nTariffs will cause some prices to go up, though, according to McPhail."

That compared to a 1.3% jump Wall Street expected.\n\"We had solid growth and performance with both Pro and DIY,\" CEO Marvin Ellison told Yahoo Finance over the phone.\nSimilar to its peer Home Depot (HD), Ellison said, \"Throughout the quarter, [Lowe's] comps got better, ending July with a positive 4.7%\" as it leaned into promotions. On Tuesday, Home Depot stock rose after the company said it saw a 3.3% same-store sales increase in July to exit its second quarter.\nAs it leans into professional services to boost sales, Lowe's also announced a deal Wednesday morning to acquire Foundation Building Materials for approximately $8.8 billion. This is on top of the recent acquisition of Artisan Design Group.\n\"When you combine FBM with our recent acquisition of ... ADG, it's going to give us the ability to give a large Pro customer a full complement of interior finishes, drywall to doors, insulation, ceiling systems, flooring, countertops, and cabinets,\" Ellison said.\nThe home improvement chain reported earnings per share in the second quarter of $4.33 on an adjusted basis, better than the $4.24 Wall Street had expected. Revenue came in at $23.96 billion; the Street had forecast revenue of $23.98 billion, according to Bloomberg data.\nIn the quarter, the average ticket increased 2.9%, but shoppers visited stores less often, with transactions down 1.8%.\nEllison said that signals consumers are still deferring larger, discretionary projects as customers are \"waiting for more confidence in the economy before they spend.\"\n\"As an example ... getting a kitchen redesign in your home, getting your bathroom remodel, those are discretionary purchases. You can wait another six months. You can wait another year if need be.\"\nNotably, Lowe's raised its guidance for the 2025 fiscal year, with total sales now projected to be in a range of $84.5 billion-$85.5 billion, up from a prior range of $83.5 billion-$84.5 billion, while same-store sales are still expected to be flat to up 1% year over year.\nAs analysts have been banking on a turnaround in the housing market to reignite momentum, Ellison said, \"We're not planning for any type of inflection to happen in our guidance.\""

The tariff environment is dynamic, to say the least. The White House has levied tariffs or threatened to levy tariffs, but often paused, postponed, or withdrawn pledged tariffs. Most recently, China and the U.S. agreed to reduce baseline tariffs to 10% for 90 days (30% in the U.S. reflecting a 20% fentanyl penalty). More than the tariffs themselves, the lack of a finished tariff infrastructure complicates business planning, staffing decisions, and capital investment. Within this dynamic environment, companies are focused on taking actions in areas they can control and planning proactively for a range of tariff scenarios. Companies are anticipating both direct and indirect tariff impacts. Direct impacts would include higher costs for imported finished goods and components, foregone sales as a result of reciprocal tariffs in other nations, and other factors. For example, a manufacturing company would face direct impacts as it pays higher prices for imported parts. Indirect impacts would include a slowing in business related to a broad softening in the economy. All companies likely will feel indirect impacts. A utility, for example, could begin to see a slowing in industrial and commercial kilowatt-hour sales, particularly in niches such as warehousing, trucking and rail, and other freight-related functions. We asked Argus analysts to survey their companies for their commentary on direct and indirect tariff impacts, as well as actions these companies are taking to mitigate the challenging trade environment. Nearly every company in Argus analyst coverage has issued commentary regarding tariffs, much as (five years ago) nearly every company in coverage had something to say about the then-developing COVID-19 pandemic. Below we offer a sampling of company responses to the unfolding tariff environment across a range of sectors and industries. We intend to update our survey on a regular basis at least until the tariff environment, in whatever shape or form, becomes a stable part of the U.S. economy.\nSoft global demand and tariffs in China harm business\nEstee Lauder manufactures and markets skincare, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.

      "text": "By Anuja Bharat Mistry, Anshi Sancheti and Samantha Marshak\n(Reuters) -Estee Lauder said on Wednesday it would cut inventory and promotions to help mitigate rising costs, after the luxury cosmetic maker warned that a $100 million hit from tariffs would weigh on its annual profit forecast. The company's shares fell about 4% in afternoon trading after Estee Lauder also forecast annual profit below estimates.\nHigher costs related to the Trump administration's unpredictable trade policies have dampened consumer spending, hurting businesses, especially higher-end brands like Estee Lauder and Tapestry as the luxury sector struggles with sagging demand.\n\"This highlights broader pressures on the beauty industry since even those companies that don't rely on imports of finished goods still have to source the bulk of their ingredients, packaging, and other materials from overseas suppliers,\" said Sky Canaves, analyst with eMarketer.\nTo reduce the impact of US-China tit-for-tat tariffs on its margins, the company said in May it would sell fewer cosmetics in China that were sourced from its U.S. factories. For China sales, Estee would rely more on cosmetics made in its factories in Japan and Europe.\nThe company sources roughly 25% of its products sold in China and the EMEA regions from U.S. manufacturing plants.\nEstee Lauder's organic net sales for the fourth quarter fell 13%, after rising 8% a year ago, hurt by softness in the skincare and makeup segments. Estee is also grappling with weakness in the U.S. and China markets as well as in the large European markets of France and Germany.\nTravel retail sales continue to be muted, accounting for two-thirds of the 8% sales decline in the fourth quarter, though plans are in place to expand the company's duty-free presence in the Americas, according to chief financial officer Akhil Shrivastava.\nTo boost earnings, Estee Lauder has also accelerated new launches in categories including skincare, introduced new luxury price tiers, increased investment, and cut costs under new CEO Stephane de La Faverie, who took up the role earlier this year.\nThe company reported a wider quarterly loss of $546 million, up from $284 million a year ago, partly due to impairment charges tied to brand performance at Too Faced and skincare brand Dr.Jart+.\nOn an adjusted basis, it earned 9 cents per share, in line with estimates.\nIt sees full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.90 to $2.10, compared with analysts' estimates of $2.21, according to data compiled by LSEG."

But inflation is still an issue and trade war may still be in play. Is a recession in the offing? With all the puts and takes and ups and downs, is it time for investors to cash in their chips? Many market-watchers attuned to risk pay attention to the VIX Volatility Index. In April, as stocks sank, the index soared above 50. That is substantially higher than the normal risk environment, which is characterized by an average VIX reading of 20. Recent readings are in the 16-17 range, which is more characteristic of a bull market. As the market fluctuates between bull and bear, we note that investors exit equities at their own peril. That's because long-term returns from stocks consistently have outpaced long-term returns from other asset classes during times of high and low rates, global growth, and global recessions. So what's a potential equity strategy for investors amid all the uncertainty? Argus believes that Min Vol is an all-weather strategy that is timely in any investing climate. Academic literature and, more to the point, returns history, indicate that Min Vol can deliver market-matching returns on an absolute basis and superior returns on a risk-adjusted basis over various time periods."

Target\u2019s upscale and stylish image began to carry national merit in the 1990s\u2014a decade in which the brand saw its top line grow threefold to almost $30 billion\u2014and has since cemented itself as a leading US retailer.

That's above the 2.4% consensus and a rebound from the 0.5% decline in the fourth quarter. Our forecast was for an increase of 1.8%. Imports decreased 30.3% as trade normalized after the first quarter's 51.6% jump in goods purchases (in advance of the expected imposition of tariffs). Net exports of goods and services, aka the trade balance, raised 2Q GDP by 4.99 percentage points, reversing a 4.61-point drag in 1Q. Companies appear to be using the stockpiles built in 1Q. Inventories cut 3.17 points from GDP after adding 2.59 points in 1Q. Spending by consumers rose 1.4%, an improvement from the 0.5% increase in 1Q. Private investment declined 15.6%, led by a 10.3% decline in nonresidential structures. Consumer spending on goods rose 2.2%. Within goods, durables were up 3.7%, after a 3.7% decline in 1Q. Nondurables were up 1.3%. The huge services category was up 1.1% after an increase of just 0.6% in 1Q. That is a little softer than we would like. This steady category added 0.53 points of growth. Government consumption and investment rose 0.4%. The federal government was down 3.7%, with national defense up 2.2%. Nondefense was down a big 11.3%, State and local government was up 3.0%. Growth in real final sales to private domestic purchasers, which exclude net exports, inventory investment, and government spending, rose 1.2 % -- slower than 1.9% in 1Q. The GDP report also contains data on inflation, which slowed in 2Q. The PCE Price Index increased 2.1% in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 3.7 in the first quarter. Excluding food and energy, the index increased 2.5%, compared with an increase of 3.5% in the previous quarter. After the report, futures on the S&P 500 were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was up two basis points to 4.36%. Based on futures trading, the probability that the Fed will keep policy steady this afternoon remained at 98%.

Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 3.4%, the S&P 500 rose 5.3%, and the Nasdaq was up 7.2%. For the year to date, the DJIA and the S&P 500 have turned positive, up 0.3% and 1.3%, respectively. The Nasdaq, down 0.5%, is close to moving into the green. Earnings season is winding down. The list of reports this week includes Palo Alto Networks on Tuesday; Target, TJX, Lowe's, and Zoom Communications on Wednesday; Intuit, Analog Devices, Williams-Sonoma, and Ralph Lauren on Thursday; and Nordstrom on Friday. Some 92% of S&P 500 companies have reported, and earnings for the quarter are up 14% from the prior-year quarter. That is far above the consensus call for EPS growth of about 3%-8% and follows 17% growth in 4Q24 EPS and 9% growth in 3Q24, according to LSEG. For 1Q, Healthcare is the leading sector, up 46%, and Energy is at the bottom, down 17%. For all of 2025, the Argus full-year earnings estimate is for low-double-digit growth from 2024. On the economic calendar, Existing Homes Sales are due out on Thursday and New Home Sales on Friday. As well, multiple Fed officials will speak publicly. The Economic Call of the Week from Argus' Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, is for growth in home prices to slow further. Prices of new and existing homes are reported along with home sales. On Thursday, the National Association of Realtors will report existing home sales for April. We expect sales of 4.1 million homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. On Friday, the Department of Housing and Urban Development will report new home sales for April. We expect sales of 650,000 homes at an annual rate. In March, the 'months supply' of existing homes rose to a still-healthy 4.0 months from 3.5 in February, though growth in existing home prices eased to 2.7% from 3.4% on a year-over-year basis. In the new home market, supply declined to 8.3 months in March from 8.9 in February, but prices slumped 2.9%. The Zillow Home Value Index for all homes rose 1.4% in April, compared with 2.6% in January, this as mortgage rates near 7% strain affordability. For other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure forecasts 2.4% for 2Q. This follows the surprise decline of 0.3% for 1Q GDP. The Argus 2025 GDP growth estimate has been lowered to 0.5% from 1.3%. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast forecasts a 2.4% rate for CPI in May, higher than the April rate. Mortgage rates inched higher last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.81%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices ticked down three cents to an average of $3.12 per gallon for regular gas. Looking ahead, the next Fed rate decision is on June 18, with odds at 9% for a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. The next meeting after that is on July 30, when odds jump to 33% for a cut.\nRecent weakness provides buying opportunity\nCAVA Group, Inc., founded in 2006, owns and operates a chain of Mediterranean restaurants. The company has 10,300 employees.\nRatingPrice TargetLast week, we commented that corporate insiders had little time to react to\nLast week, we commented that corporate insiders had little time to react to the tariff-induced plunge in stock prices that took place at the very end of the April 4 trading week. But that is old news, as a suspension of tariffs on April 9 sent stocks soaring, a pullback was evident on April 10, optimism kicked in on April 11, and tariffs were modified for many technology products over the weekend. Traders reacting to the daily news flow likely have unprecedented whiplash. But so do most other investors, insiders included. But as we said above, current weekly insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research (complied before the weekend action on technology products) has morphed, and the change is exceedingly bullish. On a scale where any ratio below 2.00 is bullish, the neutral range runs from 2.00 to 6.00, and anything above 6.00 is bearish, Vickers' Total One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 1.31 (versus 2.72 last week). Drilling down to exchanges, the NYSE One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 0.95, versus 2.14, and the Nasdaq One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 1.99, versus 3.35. For comparison, the last time Vickers' one-week data was this bullish was in November of 2023. On a sector basis, insider buying exceeded selling in Consumer Discretionary last week, with shares valued at $38 million bought versus $1.5 million sold. Buying was also notable in Healthcare, as shares valued at $18 million were bought versus $10 million sold, as well as in Financials, Real Estate, and Energy. Selling was the greatest in Industrials over the last week, with shares valued at $28 million sold versus $14 million bought, as well as in Information Technology, Utilities, and Consumer Staples (though the volume of transactions in many of these sectors was low). This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Sinclair Inc. (NGS: SBGI) and Williams-Sonoma Inc. (NYSE: WSM)."

That was fewer than the 114,000 expected and below the 60,000 added in April. The result was the smallest increase in private payrolls since March 2023, with the financial press generally blaming uncertainty over trade wars and tariffs. ADP's chief economist noted the following. 'After a strong start to the year, hiring is losing momentum. Pay growth, however, was little changed in May, holding at robust levels for both job-stayers and job-changers.' The weak reading sets up for an even more closely-watched nonfarm payrolls report by the government on Friday.\nArgus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 06/02/2025: Companies Raising Guidance\nThis first-quarter earnings season has had a special tone. As usual, many companies have offered guidance. But they also have increasingly focused on the economy, tariffs, and overall uncertainty. On tariffs specifically, managements are detailing any likely impact on profits and any plans to pass price hikes on to customers and/or consumers. Our team of analysts is factoring all this fresh data into sector outlooks, earnings forecasts, and investment ratings. We track the list of companies raising guidance, and this quarter that list often features companies in sectors such as Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Industrial, and Information Technology. Often missing are companies the Financials, Energy, and Materials sectors. Companies that are still able to raise guidance despite the tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty could feature managements that have flexibility in a changing environment, and that is often a catalyst for market-beating returns. Indeed, \"Management Signals\" is one of our Investment Themes for 2025. The following is a list of some of the companies in our Fundamental Universe of Coverage where management recently increased guidance."

Consider that in 2024, market bulls were boasting about 24%-plus S&P 500 returns. No one was very focused on the broad market index's 1.2% dividend yield. But dividends are an important element of return, and 2025 is bearing that out. Through May, the S&P 500 was up a thin 1.1%; without dividends, there was essentially no returns at all. Indeed, dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. Not for nothing, in 2022, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices turned bearish as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates. We saw that pattern in 2018 as well. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main investment categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks.\nThe Argus Sustainable Growth Theme Model Portfolio\nSustainable Impact Investing is gaining traction not only with Argus Research clients but also with the global investment community. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. Given the strategy's focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead.\nSolid tax season and fiscal 3Q25 results\nIntuit Inc. provides financial management and compliance products for small businesses, self-employed individuals, consumers, and accounting professionals in the U.S. and worldwide. QuickBooks software and related products are widely used for payroll, payment processing, point of sale, and accounting.

As it relates to what we're experiencing with customers and members here in the US, their behavior has been generally consistent. We aren't seeing dramatic shifts.\"\nIn the second quarter, US same-store sales grew 4.6%. That's more than the 4.2% Wall Street predicted, per Bloomberg consensus estimates, and ahead of the 4.5% growth seen in the first quarter. Walmart's wholesale subscription business, Sam's Club, saw the same metric grow 5.9%; the Street had forecast a 5.3% increase.\nThe company now expects net sales in its fiscal 2026 to increase between 3.75%-4.75%, up from a prior range of 3%-4% growth that the company reiterated in the prior quarter.\nRead more: Live coverage of corporate earnings\nWalmart stock came under pressure after the results showed the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, below the $0.74 the Street had forecast.

Adjusted earnings per share are expected to come in between $0.58-$0.60 in the current quarter.\nFor the full year, the company expects adjusted earnings to come in the range of $2.52-$2.62. The Street was looking for $2.61.\nWalmart called out strength in its grocery and health and wellness categories, driving its US sales growth. The company saw share gains \"across income brackets led by upper-income households\" in its US stores.\nWalmart said \"like-for-like\" inflation was 1.1% in its US stores for the quarter as it navigates tariff uncertainty.\nRead more: 5 ways to tariff-proof your finances\nBy category, the company saw grocery sales rise by mid-single digits in US stores while the health and wellness category saw sales rise by a mid-teens percentage.

But Wall Street, corporate America, and consumers are still facing high interest rates. The fed funds rate is now targeting 4.25%-4.5%. Sure, rates have come down from their recent highs in the 1.5 years -- but not nearly at the pace that most economists expected. Many of them forecast four rate cuts in 2025. But at the halfway mark of the year, we have yet to see one and the current consensus is for two cuts, at best. Argus is in that camp and has been since 1Q25. Our Fixed Income Strategist Kevin Heal believes that the Federal Reserve wants to lower its target rate, but is being patient and prudent until there is greater clarity on the impact of tariffs. Given the stubbornness of rates, we turn back to the sectors that tend to do well in an elevated-rate climate. Here is a list of industries and companies that we believe should benefit from a sustained period of higher interest rates. All are BUY-rated at Argus."

Consider that in 2024, market bulls were boasting about 24%-plus S&P 500 returns. Few were focused on the broad market index's 1.2% dividend yield. But dividends are an important element of return, and 2025 is bearing that out. Through May, the S&P 500 was up a thin 1.1%; without dividends, there was essentially no returns at all. Indeed, dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. Not for nothing, in 2022, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices turned bearish as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates. We saw that pattern in 2018 as well. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main investment categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks. High-yield stocks typically have dividends that pay out in the 5%-8% range. Though the income appears attractive, the share prices of high-yield stocks may be at risk. Indeed, if interest rates drift higher, risk-averse equity investors could be drawn to the relative safety of bonds and may sell their high-yield stocks. In addition, it is worth noting that a yield in the 7%-10% range could signal a company is struggling and the dividend is in jeopardy. Former blue-chip companies such as 3M, General Electric, Boeing, and Kraft Heinz cut their high dividends in the past few years. Lastly, high dividend payouts likely constitute a high percentage of the cash a company earns, leaving little behind for management to deploy into value-enhancing activities. Dividend-growth stocks typically have lower yields, often in the 1.0%-2.5% range. But the lower-yielding dividends are not likely to be a huge component of cash flow, opening up other value-additive options for deploying to cash management teams -- such as share buybacks, M&A, the repayment of debt, or reinvestment in the core business. Further, while the yields are not as high, management teams may be more likely to boost the payouts over time, as earnings grow. Below is a list of the Argus BUY-rated stocks that were recently added to our Dividend Growth Model Portfolio.\nTop Analysts: WMT\nView MoreOverall Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest for WMT overall weighted by direction, price target, and price movement.\nLearn MoreDirection Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the directional movement of WMT.\nLearn MorePrice Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the price target of WMT.\nLearn More"

About 35% of the company's revenue is generated outside the U.S.\nRatingPrice TargetSector Rotation as Inflation Worries Percolate The U.S. stock market\nSector Rotation as Inflation Worries Percolate The U.S. stock market continued higher through August despite a pair of unsettling inflation reports and signs, some of them anecdotal, that consumers are pulling back on spending (i.e., Las Vegas foot traffic was down 11% year over year in June). Investors have been reassured by a stellar second-quarter 2025 earnings season, but concerns about the jobs economy linger, and the outlook for third-quarter GDP is fungible after the first two quarters were dominated by tariff pre-positioning. In one sign the market is getting a little more defensive, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average has done better in August than the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. At the sector level, July and early-August strength in growth sectors Information Technology and Communication Services has them out in front for the third quarter and now for the year to date. But the AI trade is looking a little crowded, and investors may be inclined to rotate to overlooked areas as the fall gets underway. Uncertainty Driving the Stock-Market Value Hunt With the third quarter of 2025 more than halfway done, two of traditional leadership sectors -- Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary -- are back in front for the period. As of the 8/18/25 close, Information Technology (IYW) was up 6.2% for 3Q25 to date. Consumer Discretionary is something of a comeback kid; after posting a negative first half, the sector is up by 5.8% in the third quarter. The other growth sector, Communication Services, is up 2.1% as AI fatigue inevitably hits mega-caps Alphabet and Meta. That puts it in fourth place among the 11 sectors for 3Q stock performance. Utilities are in third place for 3Q25 to date, building on first-half strength that has it the third-best sector for the year to date. Utilities have traditionally been a top five sector in periods of declining interest rates; and the wait for the year's first rate cut could be over as soon as September. Utilities have another driver, in that explosive growth in AI data centers is leading to soaring demand for electric power. One surprising winner is Materials, in fourth place for the quarter with a 3.7% gain. China and the U.S. have extended their uneasy trade truce for another 90 days. Top commodities consumer China is also finding ready buyers for its manufactured goods worldwide as it continues its policy of lessening reliance on American consumers -- a policy in place before tariffs came back into play in the second Trump administration. In descending order, four sectors -- Financial, Healthcare, Industrial, and Consumer Staples - are up in the 1%-2% range for 3Q25. Energy is fractionally positive for the period, and Real Estate is fractionally negative. Financial is building on year-to-date strength, while Healthcare is trying to rebound after a down first half. For all of 2025 to date, the top five sectors are Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, Materials, and Financial. Middling sectors include Consumer Staples, Consumer Discretionary, Real Estate, and Materials. The negative year-to-date sectors are Healthcare and Energy. There is little in the current investing environment to suggest that there will be much change in this marching order when the 2025 trading year ends. 2Q25 Earnings: Double-Digit Growth S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations for 2Q25 have blown conservative expectations out of the water. With big retailers and some tech laggards reporting over the next two weeks, there could be some individual drama to come; but that will not impact the big picture. For the calendar second-quarter period, S&P 500 earnings grew in solid double-digit percentages for a third straight quarter. Neither of the two preceding quarters began with such subdued expectations nor beat expectations so soundly. Prior to earnings season, blended EPS growth estimates for 2Q25 were in the 1%-4% range. We believe analysts were unusually cautious heading into second-quarter earnings season due to tariffs, signs of slowing consumer spending, impacts from immigration enforcement policies, and other factors. Yet the largest corporations are where they are for a reason. They adapted a range of tariff mitigation strategies, carefully assessing just how much of higher goods costs to absorb and how much to pass on. That has enabled them to beat unusually conservative expectations. Strong outperformance against expectations pushed earnings growth to the mid-single-digit to high-single-digit range by late July. Then came the heavy tech hitters such as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. Their huge net-income generation pushed earnings growth above 10% by the second week of August. According to Bloomberg, and with over three-quarters of companies having reported, second-quarter earnings are up 11% year over year from 2Q24. According to FactSet, earnings growth for the quarter to date is 11.8%; that increased by three percentage points in just a week after the AI monoliths weighed in. Early in August, Refinitiv was first to report double-digit second-quarter 2025 earnings growth. Refinitiv now estimates that 2Q25 S&P earnings are up 12.9% year over year. The three agencies may have different prior-year baselines and varying definitions of what constitutes continuing-operations earnings. As all the S&P 500 companies report, the three agencies' final growth rates tend to dovetail toward one another, as they are doing now. To date, 80%-82% of companies with positive earnings have reported results above consensus expectations. That compares with a long-run average of 75%. Analyst caution may also be contributing to the magnitude of the beat against consensus expectations. According to FactSet, companies are reporting earnings that are 8.4% above estimates, compared to the 10-year average of 6.9%. Bloomberg has a more conservative take on the magnitude of the earnings beat, calculating that EPS has come in at a still-strong 7% above consensus. At the sector level, the best earnings growth in 2Q25 is coming from Communication Services, Information Technology, and Financial; earnings for all three have increased in upper-teens percentages. Sectors with more moderate but still positive growth include Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Real Estate, and Utilities. Healthcare, Consumer Staples, and Materials are all around break-even for EPS growth, while Energy earnings are down in high-teen percentages. Digging down to the industry level, most of the growth in Communication Services is coming from media (up 22%); telecom services is up in mid-single-digits. In Financial, insurance earnings growth is strongest, perhaps reflecting a quiet claims season; with Hurricane Erin already churning, that may not last. The best growth in Information Technology is coming from semiconductors, followed by software & services and then by technology hardware and equipment; here too all industries are up in double-digits. Consumer Discretionary, one of the most diverse sectors, shows retailing earnings up over 25% but consumer durable and apparel down over 35%. The decline in Healthcare earnings, according to Bloomberg, is attributable to healthcare equipment and services, where the health insurance giants are struggling. Pharmaceutical and biotech earnings are fractionally higher year over year. Argus came into 2Q25 earnings season modeling the high-single-digit to low-double-digit earnings that are now being delivered. We are not making any changes to our forecasts for S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations, maintaining $270 for 2025 and $300 for 2026. Conclusion The Fed seeks to use its policy tools -- mainly changes in the fed funds rate, but also quantitative easing or tightening -- to serve its double mandate of maintaining full employment while keeping inflation around the 2% level. A weak employment environment coupled with resurgent inflation makes the dual mandate difficult to balance. After a very weak three-month stretch for jobs creation (based on revisions), a pair of recent inflation reports added to the Fed's quandary. The All-Items Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July rose 0.2% month over month and 2.7% year over year. The core CPI, however, rose 0.3% monthly and 3.1% annually. The annual change was the highest since February 2024, meaning that a year and a half of progress on inflation has been undone. The less-well-followed Producer Price Index (PPI) was even more unsettling, rising 0.9% monthly (its highest jump since June 2022) and 3.3% annually. Weak August payrolls and large prior-months jobs revisions increased the likelihood of a fed rate cut in September, with the CME FedWatch tool shooting to a high-80% probability immediately following jobs Friday. The two inflation reports lessened that probability on the CME FedWatch tool, but only slightly. Argus Fixed Income Strategist Kevin Heal continues to believe that the Fed will cut rates twice this year, with a 25-basis-point cut in both September and December. As of this writing, Fed officials, CEOs, economists, and policy wonks are heading to Jackson Hole, where they will try to discern the Fed's intention from likely opaque commentary from Fed Chairman Powell. The focus of the symposium this year is not rate policy, but 'Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy.' At a time of declining native-born growth rates worldwide and intense immigration debates, this focus will add piquancy to an already highly anticipated event.\nPalo Alto Earnings: Strong Finish to the Year as Next Generation Security Continues to Shine\nPalo Alto Networks is a platform-based cybersecurity vendor with product offerings covering network security, cloud security, and security operations.

Is this a developing trend? Possibly, but it is far too early to make that call. Every attempt by small-caps to take over leadership from the giants since August 2018 has failed miserably and thrown mud in the face of those (including us a time or two) calling for a rebirth of the little guys. There was one time when the small-caps led, and that was late 2020 until early 2021 when the stock market was still trying to recover from the pandemic. As such, that period is easy to dismiss. The S&P 500 added 0.3% on Wednesday; the S&P 100, Nasdaq, and Nasdaq 100 were flat; the S&P Small Cap 600 (SML) popped 2.1%; and the S&P Mid Cap 400 rose 1.6%. Over the past two days, the SML has jumped an impressive 5.4%, the largest two-day sprint since stocks were coming out of the April bottom. The daily Vortex Indicator has given a buy signal, the CTM Trend Meter is showing nice strength (the highest reading since December 2024), the 21-day rate-of-change (ROC) is positive, the daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) has turned higher, and the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has broken a downtrend that started in early July. Currently, 54% of SML stocks are above their 200-day average, the highest reading in six months. There was an uptick in small-cap volume over the past two days, with the above-average action leading to two accumulation days. Longer term, the SML chart remains a volatile mess, with the index in a trading range that goes back to late 2020.

But dividends are an important element of return, and 2025 is bearing that out. Through May, the S&P 500 was up a thin 1.1%; without dividends, there was essentially no returns at all. Indeed, dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. Not for nothing, in 2022, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices turned bearish as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates. We saw that pattern in 2018 as well. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main investment categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks. High-yield stocks typically have dividends that pay out in the 5%-8% range. Though the income appears attractive, the share prices of high-yield stocks may be at risk. Indeed, if interest rates drift higher, risk-averse equity investors could be drawn to the relative safety of bonds and may sell their high-yield stocks. In addition, it is worth noting that a yield in the 7%-10% range could signal a company is struggling and the dividend is in jeopardy. Former blue-chip companies such as 3M, General Electric, Boeing, and Kraft Heinz cut their high dividends in the past few years. Lastly, high dividend payouts likely constitute a high percentage of the cash a company earns, leaving little behind for management to deploy into value-enhancing activities. Dividend-growth stocks typically have lower yields, often in the 1.0%-2.5% range. But the lower-yielding dividends are not likely to be a huge component of cash flow, opening up other value-additive options for deploying to cash management teams -- such as share buybacks, M&A, the repayment of debt, or reinvestment in the core business. Further, while the yields are not as high, management teams may be more likely to boost the payouts over time, as earnings grow.
