  "title": "Nic Novicki's life looking up at the world helped him reach new heights in comedy",
  "description": "The comedian and actor known for 'The Sopranos,' 'Boardwalk Empire' and touring with stand-up superstar and longtime friend Nate Bargatze made it a mission to not let life as a little person get him down when it came to living his comedy dream.",
  "content": "Nearly two decades ago, Nic Novicki was another young comedian living in Queens, testing his mettle in the competitive New York City comedy scene. There, he shared not just an apartment, but a living room separated by a sheet with another up-and-comer trying to make a name for himself: Nate Bargatze. They shared an apartment with fellow comedians Dustin Chafin and Rich Aronovitch.\n\nFast forward 20 years, and Bargatze is one of the most popular comedians around, selling out arenas across the country. And, he hasn\u2019t forgotten his old friend. Novicki frequently tours with him, bringing those humble beginnings to larger audiences than they ever imagined, including taking their act to the high seas on the Nateland cruise this February.\n\n\u201cWe would perform shows together every night, and then I would stay with them when I would go back to New York [from L.A.],\u201d Novicki tells The Times over Zoom. \u201cIt started with five people at a show in New York, and then clubs, and suddenly, things got bigger and bigger. It\u2019s been one of my biggest thrills to step out on stage and see that many people.\u201d\n\nAs a little person standing 3 feet 10, Novicki has a unique perspective from a physical and emotional standpoint, which he brings to his comedy. Some of his most rewarding projects have involved his work with Easterseals, the nation\u2019s largest disability services organization. With them, he\u2019s organized the Disability Film Challenge, which launched nearly 13 years ago. It\u2019s an annual five-day filmmaking competition where people with disabilities are either in front of or behind the camera, and make a film related to a specific genre \u2014 this year, for example, the theme was thriller and suspense.\n\n\u201cI created this film competition 12 years ago because I was always making my own content,\u201d he says. \u201cThe story of my life has been, as a comedian, to get up on stage and do as much as you can rather than wait for the industry to come to me.\u201d\n\nIn addition to comedic endeavors, Novicki has made a name for himself as an actor. He was a regular on the HBO series \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d and appeared on \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cLoudermilk,\u201d \u201cThe Neighbors\u201d and \u201cDrop Dead Diva.\u201d\n\nWe spoke with the Culver City-based comedian ahead of his slot at the Burbank Comedy Festival next week, where he breaks down his stand-up routine, opening for Nate and his perspective on comedy as a little person, as well as why the work he\u2019s done with Easterseals has been so imperative.\n\nDo you have a different approach when you\u2019re performing in front of thousands at an arena show with Nate versus a club show?\n\nMy act is focused on storytelling. A lot of what I do is kind of story-based about my life and the interactions that have happened. Nowadays, it\u2019s with my family, and my daughters are a huge part of it. Regardless of the size of the venue. For example, if I\u2019m doing a late-night set at the Comedy Store or another comedy club, my act stays the same. Ultimately, I\u2019m at that stage in my life. I do the same bits, and there\u2019s no need for me to feel like I need to be edgier. The same bits will work late night or early in the day when Nate has an early show. Recently, I did a show that was really fun called BYOB \u2014 bring your own baby.\n\nWhere was that and what was it like?\n\nIt was at [Santa Monica comedy club] the Crow. My wife brought our baby. Ultimately, I\u2019ve always been able and comfortable talking about who I am. I\u2019ve always done well with kids, which was the origin [of comedy] for me. When I was 10 or 11 years old, I started doing speeches that raised money for the Little People of America. I would perform at Rotary Clubs, and I remember early on, I would be standing behind a podium, be like, \u201cOh, did you guys forget the stool here? What\u2019s going on?\u201d It would be the Invisible Man bit, and everybody laughed. I realized then that I had everybody, and they were paying attention.\n\nEven at that age, you understood showbiz. You knew how to work an audience.\n\nIt\u2019s funny. I didn\u2019t think of it as a comedian, but I was doing a version of stand-up comedy. Growing up on the East Coast and being a little person, I used comedy as a way to break the ice, and also be like, \u201cHey, let\u2019s be funny and lighten the situation.\u201d\n\nWhen did you decide to pursue comedy as a career?\n\nI started doing stand-up comedy during my freshman year of college at Temple University in Philadelphia. I went there to study business, but I was like, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d It\u2019s a great city for comedy, and now, in a full circle of wildness, we [Bargatze and he] are performing two shows at the Wells Fargo Center. There are these different places that I haven\u2019t been to in a long time, like Erie, Pa., where I have family. Thanks to comedy, going back there for the first time to perform in a giant arena with Nate is pretty wild.\n\nWhat is it about both of your comedic styles that appeals to so many?\n\nAside from Nate being one of my best friends, he\u2019s just the best at what he does. Both of us have very similar sensibilities and senses of humor. It\u2019s been great for me because I don\u2019t have to change my style of comedy to fit with his. When I was starting, I was never dirty, but maybe I\u2019d swear a little. I realized so much of my life is about being in the Little People of America. Little people and people with disabilities are asking me for advice about how I was able to create my own projects. Ultimately, that\u2019s the kind of comedy that I\u2019m drawn to, and it\u2019s part of my daily life. I\u2019m proud to be a little person. I\u2019m proud to be who I am, and I can\u2019t hide it.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy, though, to get the audience to laugh at something uncomfortable. In this case, laughing with you about your disability.\n\nI\u2019m 3-10. So it\u2019s not like I could be not 3-10, so it\u2019s part of what my world is. My wife is little, and I\u2019ve grown up in Little People of America. It\u2019s not entirely what I\u2019m about as a comedian \u2014 I like to talk about things other than my height, but it is a part of who I am. I\u2019m a storyteller, and the situations that happen involve my height. Whether it\u2019s dropping my daughter off at daycare \u2026 these are real-life situations that happen. Rather than be uncomfortable in the moment, I\u2019ve embraced it, laughed and been OK with just having that discussion in that moment. I look at the positive and the comedy of a situation because it\u2019s something that I find funny, rather than being upset by it, like being patient and asking someone to help me press a button in an elevator. This may sound crazy, but I\u2019ve met so many people by asking for help, like reaching for a plate. Now, I have a connection with this person that I wouldn\u2019t have had. As a comedian, I think you have to be open to life and what happens, and be able to comment on it.\n\nThe Easterseals Disability Film Challenge is a significant source of pride for you. Now, nearly 13 years later, what do you see as its legacy?\n\nIt\u2019s grown so much. Since partnering with Easterseals Southern California, we\u2019ve had 850 films created from around the world. We have our awards ceremony at Sony Pictures every year. Nate has presented alongside the Farrelly brothers, Phil Lord and Chris Miller. I feel like the disability community is a community, and it\u2019s something I\u2019m so proud to be a part of. I\u2019ve made so many friends and forged lifelong bonds with both little people and through the Film Challenge. Much like my comedy career, it\u2019s been a gradual climb. It\u2019s been the long game for me, as an actor and comedian with the Film Challenge. My whole vision is to do as much as you can, and I think the world wants to see more disability representation.\n\nI do a regular show at Flappers in Burbank where I headline, and it\u2019s Nic Novicki and friends. I always have a disabled comic from the Easterseals Disability Film Challenge perform to highlight them. I love having that world where people can get themselves out there, and that was always the mission. Initially, the Disability Film Challenge was going to be a one-off competition where I helped disabled friends who asked me for advice, and allowed them to make a film and tell their own stories. After that first one, right away, casting directors started reaching out to me asking how to get in touch with a guy in a wheelchair, and all of a sudden, we had five films that first year. All of these films are starring and created by people with disabilities. It\u2019s been great to see the number of jobs that have come from this, and something I\u2019m incredibly proud of.\n\nIt\u2019s funny. I was in New York City with a group of people, and I was like, \u201cI know every little person in the world,\u201d and they were like, \u201cYeah, sure, sure, you do.\u201d So we\u2019re walking on Madison Avenue, and a little person popped up out of nowhere and said, \u201cHey, Nick, what\u2019s up?\u201d I looked at them and said, \u201cYou see?\u201d I swear to God, it was sitcom-esque timing, but it really happened.",

      "text": "Being a special ed teacher taught Chinedu Unaka his biggest lesson in stand-up\n- Share via\nThere are some aspects of comedy you just can\u2019t teach. But for comedian Chinedu Unaka, plenty was learned while giving lessons in a classroom. As a kid growing up in South L.A., it wasn\u2019t planned that he would find his way to comedy by stepping up to the chalkboard to teach mild to moderate special education students how to do algebra. But looking back on it, he says, there was really no better training ground for practicing the basics of his future craft \u2014 keeping eye contact, learning crowd work, making entertainment out of boring subjects.\nFor over a decade, his passion-driven work that he fell into in college at UC Santa Barbara would become the day job that both funded his dream and gave him the tools to achieve it as he held the attention of kids with ADHD while making them learn while laughing. Coming at comedy from the lens of a charismatic instructor with a Nigerian American background, Unaka\u2019s quick wit and dry humor about life, relationships and his immigrant parents is on full display in his latest special, \u201cLOL Live With Chinedu Unaka,\u201d which premiered last month on Hulu. Unaka talked to The Times recently about his unique path into stand-up that also led to acting on shows like \u201cInsecure\u201d and \u201cAbbott Elementary.\u201d\nYour background as a special education teacher comes up a lot in your new special. What inspired you to take that career path before comedy?\nI think something like that has to be in you a little bit. I was always that kid in school who was trying to help my friends understand the material better or help my teammates try to pass classes and stuff like that. So I knew that part was always in me. I\u2019ve always been a person that had a desire to help and share what I know. When I was in college, I started stand-up comedy, and I knew I liked this art form, but I didn\u2019t necessarily know how to make money. Randomly, I saw a Teach for America group promoting in the quad at school. And so that\u2019s when I approached them. I figured \u201cOh, I could be a teacher. I\u2019m probably done by 3:30-4 o\u2019clock, and still have my nights and do what I need to do while figuring out stand-up.\u201d I applied to Teach for America and that\u2019s kind of how I got into education. I was pretty good at it, just because I think A) having a heart for it. And then, B) I think humor plays a big part in helping teachers become great. Teaching helped me become a better comedian as well. Teaching mild to moderate special education students algebra and trying to make that entertaining was a lot harder than performing at a comedy club.\nKids can definitely be a tough crowd.\nEspecially when you\u2019re trying to teach them something they are not necessarily in the mood to learn. So watching how students would relate to different lessons and why this lesson went well versus this lesson, etc., when it comes to a lot of those small things, I kind of applied it to doing stand-up. That included getting better at maintaining eye contact on stage with certain people, or moving across the stage a certain way, or knowing when is it time to actually go into a crowd and do some crowd work, to bring the energy back into the room.\nYou grew up in South L.A. and Harbor City, and then you went to college in UC Santa Barbara; definitely a culture shock in terms of diversity. What was your first experience with stand-up in college? How did that help you find your voice later as a comedian?\nIt definitely helped. Because being from Harbor City or the Carson area, it\u2019s super diverse. So my high school, Narbonne High, we had everybody there. \u2026 And so I was used to white folks, but I never met white folks that had never met Black folks until I got to UC Santa Barbara. I think that\u2019s kind of what helps my comedy too, because I have friends from different places, and because I\u2019m genuinely interested and curious about people\u2019s stories and their background. I think when I write to tell my own story it is easily digestible by everyone just because I have an understanding of many different types of people. And so when I started comedy in college, it was definitely something random that my friend Dion was constantly trying to get me to do because you thought I was just a little bit funnier than average, but it was something that I loved watching. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily be anything I wanted to do until I dared to try it, and the bug bit me. I was like, \u201cOh, my funny off-stage kind of translates onstage,\u201d and then the joke writing came quicker than usual, because I was writing a lot of poetry and music in high school, and so I was used to playing with words. So I was able to survive onstage because of that background of writing and then the performance came later.\nWhat areas of the L.A. scene helped you tighten your craft and what aspects of it are unique?\nThere were two comedy clubs that are now closed \u2014 the J Spot and the Comedy Union. Those were huge for me, because when I moved back to L.A., they were the first places to let me onstage. And it was historically, more of like a Black entertainment spot.\nHave any of your former students ever come see you perform material about them?\nA lot of my co-workers came to see me while I was working. A lot of them still come to see me after I left teaching [in 2015]. I had students being in the audience, like they\u2019re grown people. I\u2019ll be like walking down the street sometimes and I\u2019ll hear, \u201cMr. Unaka!\u201d\nWhat\u2019s been the best gig that you\u2019ve had so far as an actor?\nEither \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d or \u201cInsecure.\u201d I think just as an educator, to be on that show was really cool. I didn\u2019t play an educator on the show. I was a parent. But I know Quinta [Brunson] as well, and then director Justin [Halpern] as well, got to meet Janelle James on that set, and everybody\u2019s just super nice. So I do remember that being a really cool moment, being on that show as someone that cares so much about education. Then also \u201cInsecure\u201d was dope as well, because my good friend Yvonne Orji was one of the stars of that show. And so finally getting to be on that show was really cool.\nWith Yvonne being a fellow Nigerian American, did you guys ever talk about how your path in comedy might be different than other Black comics\u2019?\nOftentimes you\u2019re going to be the only person within your immediate family that kind of went that route [of doing comedy]. I have four other siblings. They\u2019re all service workers \u2014 have a sister who is a doctor. My little brother is a doctor. My older brother worked at probation services. So as a comic you\u2019re doing something, yeah, so different than what your parents might necessarily want. And so when you find someone of Nigerian descent, also kind of like taking a risk or just walking their own path that\u2019s like, true to their souls. It is cool and it is comforting to have that camaraderie and to kind of keep that energy around you. That way you could focus on what needs to be done versus on the thought of, \u201cDid I make a mistake?\u201d or something. Comedy definitely found me. I wasn\u2019t searching for it, but when it did find me, it felt like home. And, yeah, it\u2019s just something that I just genuinely enjoy doing and it has nothing to do with, like, anything that could necessarily come from it. I just genuinely always love making people laugh and then to get paid for that still feels crazy to me.\nTo get your own special on Hulu through Kevin Hart\u2019s LOL Network and Hartbeat must feel like a big moment for you. How did that come about?\nFirst, shout-out to Kevin for even putting vehicles like this out there, because he doesn\u2019t have to. And it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s done something like this before. I worked with him when he was booking comedians for his LOL Network to go to tape for Just for Laughs. And at that point, I never did Just for Laughs, only auditioned for the \u201cNew Faces\u201d showcase and stuff like that. But this was a thing that I didn\u2019t have to audition for. His people reached out to my people, like \u201cwe love Chinedu to do this for us.\u201d They paid us, they put us up, they flew us out. And it was during the festival, and it was an incredible feeling. So to work with him again on something similar but on a bigger scale was definitely like a dream come true; especially respect who Kevin is as an artist, but then also just his work ethic and how he goes about his business and how he\u2019s just very forthcoming and helping the younger generation get more eyes on them. So doing that, and then doing with the people at Hartbeat as well and seeing how much attention to detail they took to it, versus it being a rush job. It felt dope, just like the way it looked. They filled the room. Everything about it felt actually special. So to have an opportunity to be one of these comedians selected was incredible. And I\u2019m happy that I was ready for it, and that it went well. We basically had one shot to tape it too. I think I got it right.\nWhat do you think is next for you in your career?\nI think what\u2019s next for me is to definitely, you know, produce some TV show ideas that I have. I would love to get those out to people then definitely start having this podcast me and my boy, James Davis, are doing named after my first album, \u201cMostly Kidding,\u201d and so I\u2019ll be releasing that soon. And that\u2019s really just to give the audience another vehicle to understand my humor, understand more of who I am, what I\u2019ve been through. Then outside of that, just hoping to make comedy with friends.\nChinedu Unaka performs at 9:45 p.m. Thursday at the Laugh Factory in Hollywood."

      "text": "How a Westside love story hatched the Crow, Santa Monica\u2019s newest comedy club\n- Share via\nDespite being named after a jet-black bird, the Crow in Santa Monica offers the opposite of the dark brick-walled trope audiences envision when they think of a comedy club. Instead, you\u2019ll find light catapulting off of pristine white walls and seeping through the corrugated tin roof, spilling into corners and onto the warm, wooden stage. Lush, green plants, each one watered every Wednesday, sprawl and stretch toward the sun. Rows of velvet, midcentury chairs patiently wait for an audience. If you didn\u2019t know jokes were told here, you would think this was a space where artists huddle to discuss the nuances between Seurat and Signac or where book clubs commune over cups of coffee.\nThe three-part club, which houses a main stage, a \u201cnest\u201d on the second floor for smaller shows, and a green room with a charming reading nook, is the manifestation of Nicole and Mickey Blaine\u2019s lifelong dream. \u201cI started performing stand-up while pregnant with my second [child] and started going to open mics right after I had given birth,\u201d Nicole says, her elbow propped on the club\u2019s bar, which currently serves chocolate milk and apple juice.\n\u201cI was 34 years old when I started stand-up. I was literally pumping breast milk on the way to the Meltdown, which was the coolest spot in L.A. for open mics, and I felt like nobody looked like me,\u201d she says while surveying the stage. \u201cThey were all very young and very cool. And I would put these little bottles of breast milk in a freezer bag, walk in and hope that I wasn\u2019t leaking.\u201d\nFor Nicole, creating a safe and accessible space for comics at all stages of their careers was a vision she shared with Mickey since they began performing.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always believed in comedy. In our lowest points, somebody\u2019s always been there to rein us back in and make us feel comforted,\u201d Mickey says. \u201cWe wanted to provide this community space to provide an opportunity for people that maybe don\u2019t always have opportunities.\u201d\nCheer up at one of these spots for stand-up comedy in L.A.\nIf you ask the Blaines, who have been married for 20 years, how the Crow got its name, you will get a love story. The pair grew up on the Westside of Los Angeles in the \u201990s and bonded on the set of their high school\u2019s adaptation of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d Nicole, a munchkin, and Mickey, the scarecrow, talked for hours while painting a backdrop of the Wicked Witch\u2019s crows.\nWhen Nicole was 18, she said goodbye to her family, Mickey and friends and moved to UC Davis. Then in the middle of her freshman year, she got a call from her brother, who begged her to come home right away. \u201cMy stepdad had a severe nervous breakdown and became a crack addict,\u201d says Nicole. \u201cIn the midst of my mother trying to save him \u2014 his business, the house \u2014 she became addicted herself.\u201d\nIn a taping of \u201cPipe Dreams,\u201d a one-woman show Nicole performed at the Hudson Theatre in 2005, she brings her mother onstage for a Q&A. An audience member asks her mother about the time she offered her teenage daughter crack. \u201cIf you\u2019re an ex-crackhead, you know that there\u2019s a part of your brain that is not functioning with reality at all,\u201d her mother said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that I really wanted her to take it. I think that what I really wanted was for her to let me continue taking it.\u201d\nOn the day she was back in town from college, Nicole ran into Mickey while hanging out with a mutual friend. At the end of the night, in proper \u201990s courtship, he gave her his pager number, and when she returned to UC Davis, they talked every day. \u201cWe always found ourselves in deep conversations about the future and about the kind of person we want to be with,\u201d Mickey recalls. A die-hard optimist, Nicole credits that chance meeting to her mother. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for that tragedy, I wouldn\u2019t have run into him [Mickey] on that one day, on that one spot,\u201d she says. \u201cI would never have been home if it hadn\u2019t been for that phone call.\u201d\nTwo weeks later, Nicole\u2019s roommate told her a guy named Mickey had called and was waiting for her at the airport. \u201cI borrowed a friend\u2019s car and went to the airport,\u201d Nicole laughs. \u201cHe looked at me, and he\u2019s like, \u2018I just want to let you know, I love you. And I\u2019m gonna marry you one day.\u2019\u201d\nShe left Davis to move back to her childhood home in Santa Monica and take care of her 14-year-old brother. Mickey moved in with her, and he worked three jobs to help get Nicole and her brother through that tough period. Eventually, Nicole applied to Loyola Marymount University and went back to college. \u201c[Mickey] put me through college, and I said, \u2018As soon as I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll turn around and I\u2019ll get you in.\u2019 We only overlapped at LMU for about a year. But we did it.\u201d\nSince then, Nicole and Mickey have produced several projects together including \u201cLife\u2019s a Bit,\u201d Nicole\u2019s stand-up special on Prime Video, and \u201cVirgin Sacrifice,\u201d a live show at the Westside Comedy Theater, where first-timers shared the stage with the likes of Damon Wayans, Ali Wong and Jeff Garlin. \u201cI\u2019ve had almost a hundred virgins,\u201d jokes Nicole.\nYet it was the pandemic and the encouragement of Nicole\u2019s mother, who is now clean, that led to the creation of the Crow. When Nicole struggled with depression in 2020, her mother reminded Nicole of her dream of building a theater. \u201cShe goes, \u2018I will get you there,\u2019\u201d says Nicole. \u201c\u2018I will get you through this. I\u2019ll teach you how to do it. I\u2019ll co-sign whatever you need. I will watch your kids while you and Mickey work late. Let me gift it back to you.\u2019\u201d\nOver the next year, Nicole and Mickey searched for the Crow\u2019s home around L.A. \u2014 their hometown of Santa Monica, where comedy venues are sparse, drew them in. \u201cThere\u2019s something homegrown, being from somewhere and giving back to the community that gave so much to you,\u201d Nicole says. The duo settled on Bergamot Station, an artist colony owned by the city of Santa Monica since 1994 and a major stop for the Big Blue Bus, the city\u2019s main public transit.\nToday, the Crow offers a stage and a community for every type of comic. The lineup of shows is keenly aware of not just today\u2019s audience filling each of the club\u2019s 75 seats, but also the people who will be sitting there 10 years from now. A big focus of the Crow is a comedy summer camp where kids are taught how to write and perform their own material; it ends with a live performance for family and friends. \u201cI want you to have access to top-level comedians so that you can see the top pros and talk to them and ask them, \u2018Did this work?\u2019 \u201d says Nicole when describing the lessons taught during the camp. \u201cIt\u2019s integrating the professional level, seasoned comedians, and letting them connect to Gen Z, who is going to have so much to say, and we need to give them the tools for it.\u201d\nThe Blaines are also determined to dedicate weekly shows for regulars and newcomers to gather, whether they\u2019re first-timers or pros. Tuesdays are slated for \u201cBoys Drool,\u201d a 6 p.m. open mic for female and nonbinary comics where $5 gets you five minutes on the mic. Those same evenings, at 7:30 p.m., the Crow \u201cwelcomes all who welcome all\u201d during \u201cMurder at the Mic,\u201d where your name being plucked from a bucket gives you a three-minute set. There are also plans to host a BYOB comic night for mothers. \u201cThis is a place built for breastfeeding, old geriatric women. It\u2019s going to be called BYOB: Bring your own baby. Bring your own boob. Bring your own bottle,\u201d grins Nicole. \u201cFree stroller parking.\u201d\nOther shows on the docket include \u201cCall Me by My Hebrew Name,\u201d which will be hosted by Abby Feldman every month in honor of Shabbat \u2014 Nicole visualizes the stand-up as \u201ca full comedic Seder\u201d \u2014 and \u201cComedia en Espa\u00f1ol,\u201d a lineup celebrating Mexican Independence Day that will be 100% in Spanish. Veteran comics who have rolled through the Crow since it opened in June include Ian Edwards, Willie Macc, Jenny Zigrino, Jordan Conley, Danny Jolles and Dana Moon.\nOn a recent night, comic Kalea McNeill took to the stage for one of the an installment of the TV series \u201cLaugh After Dark\u201d to tape a sold-out, hourlong special. \u201cI knew that the special that we would shoot was going to be amazing because I was completely at home in that space,\u201d McNeill said after the show. \u201cIt just had a very grass-roots aesthetic that I love. I\u2019m a big DIYer. Sometimes you have to do it yourself within the seat that\u2019s working.\u201d\nThe Crow\u2019s knack for creating a haven for comics and audiences that translates from day to night or, as Mickey puts it, offers a place \u201cwhere you\u2019re not scared to turn on the lights,\u201d goes back to how it all started: two kids in love trying to figure life out.\nIf you ask the Blaines about their matching tattoos, they\u2019ll tell you the story behind the Crow. After their first weekend together in Davis, Mickey had a flight to catch. Outside the dorm, there was a taxi waiting, and the sky was dark, odd for the early morning. As the couple walked hand-in-hand toward the driver, suddenly the trees burst into life, and what they thought were leaves transformed into hundreds of black-winged birds taking flight. \u201cWhen the crows flew away, all the light poured in. There was no darkness, and everything turned to brightness,\u201d says Nicole. To remember that day, Nicole and Mickey inked their arms with a tree, half of its branches bare under a flock of crows.\n\u201cI want it to be the type of comedy club that makes an impact on the human experience and makes everyone realize that life is going to be OK,\u201d says Nicole. \u201cThis is one of the most powerful art forms. When you walk into my space, you should be flooded with love and joy. Let this be your home.\u201d"

      "text": "Here\u2019s everything we know about Taylor Swift\u2019s new album \u2018The Life of a Showgirl\u2019\n- Share via\nStep aside, tortured poets. It\u2019s a showgirl era now.\nOn Tuesday morning, Taylor Swift announced her new LP, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d and here\u2019s everything \u2014 a meager bounty, for now \u2014 that we know about it.\n1. Word arrived after a countdown clock to 12:12 a.m. \u2014 an apropos debut for news of her 12th album. Swift made the announcement on \u201cNew Heights,\u201d the popular podcast co-hosted by her boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 tight end Travis Kelce.\n2. While there\u2019s no information yet about a tracklist or collaborators, shortly after the news, a string of billboards in New York and Nashville directed fans to a Spotify playlist titled \u201cAnd, baby, that\u2019s show business for you.\u201d It\u2019s full of previously-released Swift hits produced by Max Martin and Shellback, suggesting the pop superproducers had prominent roles on the new record.\n3. There\u2019s no release date, but it\u2019s available for preorder on Swift\u2019s website now. The cover art is \u2014 assuming this isn\u2019t some misdirection \u2014 a cryptic minty green background and sparkly orange padlock.\n4. Swift has been relentless in releasing new music over the last few years. In 2024, she released \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d followed by a massive \u201cAnthology\u201d edition of bonus tracks, which made \u201cPoets\u201d the bestselling album of the year.\n5. Additionally, she re-purchased her back catalog of master recordings, first released through Big Machine Records, from investment group Shamrock Capital for a rumored nine-figure sum. Swift\u2019s rerecorded \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d editions of those albums were a popular rebuttal to her old nemesis Scooter Braun\u2019s purchase of her catalog.\nWhile two of those \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d LPs (her self-titled debut and \u201cReputation\u201d) remain unreleased or unfinished, she now plans to reissue the originals as well."

      "text": "- Share via\nFor the first episode of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d 50th season, Bowen Yang dressed up as Moo Deng, a baby hippo the internet was then obsessed with. Yang\u2019s all-in appearance during the series\u2019 \u201cWeekend Update\u201d segment conflated Moo Deng\u2019s journey with that of reluctant pop star Chappell Roan \u2014 a surprising combination that captivated the audience.\n\u201cI was surprised by the way it took off,\u201d Yang says, speaking over Zoom from New York. \u201cWe were juxtaposing these two cultural things, the ways that people were pushing through any sense of boundaries that these two living beings had. It was observational, and I think the response was this force-multiplying thing where people did not think these two lenses could be stuck on top of each other.\u201d\nAs with many of his popular sketches, Yang found it fascinating to follow the trajectory of the appearance after the episode aired. On one hand, he was thrilled by its levity. But he also describes having \u201ca self-flagellating instinct\u201d to worry it would lose its relevance. \u201cIt has all these different directional tensions to it, and I\u2019m proud of it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut a sketch is such a disposable medium that is both great and that feels like there is no bottom, so you constantly have to keep filling it.\u201d\nSince joining \u201cSNL\u201d as a writer in 2018 and then as a cast member in 2019, Yang has delighted viewers with his willingness to play everyone from a famous hippo to George Santos to Charli XCX. He\u2019s sung with Lady Gaga, kissed Ariana Grande and portrayed the iceberg that sank the Titanic. His eclectic approach has not only earned him four Emmy nods for supporting actor in a comedy series but also solidified him as a fan favorite.\n\u201cMy only intention at the show has been to try as many things as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cWith impressions, I\u2019m like, \u2018Let me just try it. Let me try my hand at these little dishes and go from there.\u2019 That was my approach even when I could have really specialized. And I have the show to thank for giving me an opportunity to try out different things.\u201d\nThere was one impression that Yang was less sure about. In Season 50, \u201cSNL\u201d creator Lorne Michaels asked Yang to play Vice President JD Vance. The comedian says he \u201cvery intentionally\u201d tried to talk Michaels out of it, but he wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cSo I put my best foot forward,\u201d Yang says. \u201cI hired a dialect coach. I requested a screen test to get the beard right. I tried color contacts. I feel like I\u2019ve developed this reputation where I will do my best even if I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the best person for it.\u201d\nThe guest hosts of NBC\u2019s comedy sketch host can help make or break and episode, so let\u2019s celebrate the ones who brought their A-game.\nYang says he will step back into Vance\u2019s beard again for Season 51 if he\u2019s called on to reprise the role, even if he would prefer to put his energy elsewhere. \u201cIt might sound like a complaint to say I really didn\u2019t want to do it, but it truly just is me reflecting on it,\u201d Yang says. \u201cI\u2019m really honored and proud to have done it. And I thought a lot about the legacy of other cast members who have done vice presidential impressions in the past, like Beck Bennett, Jason Sudeikis and Tina Fey. Those are all heroic comedians to me.\u201d\nBeing part of \u201cSNL\u201d has helped to hone Yang\u2019s comedic instincts, as well as his ability to pitch and write sketches on an impossibly fast-paced timeline. He\u2019s not sure if being on the late-night show has made him funnier, but it has made him quicker. \u201cYou are absorbing every kind of comedic sensibility and every kind of production instinct,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m a better comedian, but I do think I have a sense of how to bring something to the finish line.\u201d\nThis year, Yang made Emmy history by becoming the most-nominated Asian male performer, with a total of four acting nominations. The accolade wasn\u2019t something that occurred to Yang until it was published in a headline, but he is nonetheless pleased, calling it a \u201cgenuinely singular thing.\u201d He remembers Michaels telling him that \u201cpeople won\u2019t know what to make of you\u201d during his first season in the cast, and it\u2019s gratifying to know that his Asian and gay identities resonate with the audience.\n\u201cThe best thing about \u2018SNL\u2019 in the last few years is that it\u2019s this really representative cross-section of all different schools of comedy,\u201d Yang says. \u201cWe have club comedians, alt comedians, people who came up on TikTok, sketch people, improv people, Black people, queer people \u2014 every kind of comedy has a place in the show.\u201d\nIn November, Yang will return as Pfannee in \u201cWicked: For Good.\u201d He also hosts a podcast, \u201cLas Culturistas,\u201d with Matt Rogers. But after the whirlwind of \u201cWicked\u201d going to the Oscars and \u201cSNL\u201d celebrating its 50th anniversary, Yang is not planning to add anything else to his plate as he prepares for the next season of \u201cSNL.\u201d Still, he admits that he has considered what he might do next.\n\u201cEveryone starts thinking about life after \u2018SNL\u2019 as soon as they start \u2018SNL,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cYou constantly think about the outcome once you call it or once it\u2019s called for you. I could end up on the chopping block, who knows. That was brought to the fore during \u2018SNL 50.\u2019 No matter what happens here at this place, no matter what the political climate is or the cultural climate is, there\u2019s something beautiful about being able to gather and reflect and appreciate each other. I can\u2019t wait to be on a porch with James Austin Johnson or Sarah Sherman one day, decades from now, and be like, \u2018Wow. What a trip.\u2019\u201d"
