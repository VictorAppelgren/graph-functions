  "content": "And, last year, ESSEC Business School in France created the Institute for Geopolitics & Business as part of its 2024-2028 Transcend Strategy.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Cambridge Judge Business School introduced a new MBA module, \u201cGeopolitics and Financial Regulation,\u201d exploring how conflicts, trade wars, and regulatory divergence impact global finance.\n\nFrance\u2019s ESCP is creating a new school of governance that will operate alongside its business school as well as a new technology school under a restructured European University of Management.\n\nEDHEC is hardly alone. Across Europe and Canada, business schools are launching schools, centers, degrees, and courses to confront both new geopolitical challenges as well as those that have lingered for decades. Students are being taught how to navigate international trade wars, contested energy markets, fractured alliances, and misinformation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want the chair to be something which sees geopolitics only as risks. It is a matter of opportunity. Our motto for the chair is \u2018anticipate, act, and do not injure.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cUsually geopolitical issues are perceived through risk management. But, we are now in an environment which is much less stable. You need leaders prepared to not just react, but to anticipate and identify opportunities,\u201d de Rancourt tells Poets&Quants.\n\nDe Rancourt\u2019s new mission is to help students and business leaders decode global threats, anticipate military and diplomatic disruption, and craft corporate strategy amid geopolitical turbulence.\n\nIn June, Edhec Business School in France announced the creation of a new Chair of Geopolitics and Business Strategy , part of its strategic plan, Generations 2050 , which aims to teach students how to transform business for the common good. The chair is co-directed by de Rancourt and Mailys Vicaire, EDHEC\u2019s director of management education.\n\nLuc de Rancourt, a retired General of the Arm\u00e9e l\u2019Air et de l\u2019Espace (French Air and Space Force), spent nearly 40 years flying in and out of war zones. His first operational deployment was the Gulf War, his last to Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks. He ended his military career reporting directly to the French Minister of Defense. He was Deputy Commander of French Special Forces, served on NATO missions, and trained at the US Air Force Academy.\n\nLuc de Rancourt, co-director of EDHEC Business School\u2019s new Chair in Geopolitics & Corporate Strategy, was part of geopolitics panel for World In Progress on June 24 in Chantilly, France. Courtesy photo\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing the world\u2019s growing brutalization, placing companies directly on the battlefield of a hybrid war. Welcome to the dark age of post-globalization, which profoundly destabilizes economic and operational models. \u201d says Aur\u00e9lien Colson, an associate professor of political science and co-director of ESSEC\u2019s new institute.\n\n\u201cThis calls for major transformations across all corporate functions \u2013 CEOs, CFOs, CMOs, COOs, CTOs. It may even require the creation of a Chief Geopolitical Officer within executive committees.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, de Rancourt witnessed a series of geopolitical shocks with real economic consequences: the Russia-Georgia war, repercussions from China\u2019s first satellite strike, and the collapse of the Doha trade round. It was also the year of the global financial crisis, and the first meeting of the G20 to invite to the table leaders of emerging powers like Brazil, Mexico, Russia, and China.\n\n\u201cFor me, that really marks the entry into a new geopolitical era,\u201d de Rancourt says. \u201cThe end of what I would call a rather naive, or candid, globalization.\u201d\n\n2025\u2019s shocks are just as urgent. he describes the current moment as global anomie, a disorganized world without common values.\n\nHe sees the collapse of a unipolar order, rising U.S.\u2013China rivalry, a protracted war in Ukraine, and instability in the Middle East. The climate crisis remains an existential threat, but one the international community seems too divided to solve.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s artificial intelligence. \u201c(Business leaders) are entering the most acute information and governance crisis in my lifetime,\u201d says Alan Jagolinzer, vice-dean of programs at Cambridge Judge.\n\n\u201cPeople do not know what is real and what is fake\u2026 This will affect everything from what is purchased to who governs.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, Judge hosted the first Cambridge Disinformation Summit, convening scholars and policymakers to confront systemic information risks. It hosted the second this past April.\n\n\u201cOur students will also sadly be tempted by huge profit potential from building businesses that capitalize on people\u2019s addictions to these information and AI technologies. I have never seen a more acute need for this type of education and we need to deploy it urgently,\u201d Jagolinzer says.\n\n\u201cWe likely have the next Zuckerberg or Altman in our audiences. We have a responsibility to help frame their future work in the context of societal impact, before they launch.\u201d\n\nEliot Higgins, founder of Bellingcat, an investigative collective of researchers and citizen journalists speaks at Cambridge Judge\u2019s 2025 Cambridge Disinformation Summit. (Photo: Lina and Tom Photography)\n\nIn response, international business schools are building institutes, degrees, research partnerships, and full academic divisions aimed at the intersection of geopolitics and business. Others are doubling down on long-standing programs.\n\nIn 2025, IMD released \u201cFrom Blind Spots to Insights: Enhancing Geopolitical Radar to Guide Global Business,\u201d a whitepaper from a significant research initiative developed in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group and the World Economic Forum. Next year, ESCP will launch an Executive Master\u2019s in Strategy and Defense Studies working with industry, economic agencies and the French military.\n\nCanada\u2019s Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto has offered a Master of Global Affairs/Master of Business Administration (MGA/MBA) for several years in conjunction with the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy. This year, it is offering \u201cNavigating US/Canada Relations and Business Response to US/Canada Trade Tensions\u201d as an MBA elective. It is taught by the Hon. Bill Morneau, Canada\u2019s 39th Minister of Finance and former Governor at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\n\nJavier Solana, president of EsadeGeo, and Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president of the European Commission, at the 13th Annual Energy Conference hosted in May 2025 by EsadeGeo, the European Commission\u2019s delegation in Spain, and InnoEnergy at Esade Madrid.\n\nIn Spain, Esade Business School uses research from its Center for Global Economy and Geopolitics (EsadeGeo) in most of its programs. The center was founded in 2010 when Javier Solana, former Secretary General of NATO and EU High Representative for Common Security and Defense Policy, joined the business school. Today, scholars from the Department on Society, Policy and Sustainability and the Department of Strategy.\n\n\u201cWe currently are in a space where different geopolitical actors do not agree on what constitutes fair trade and legitimate economic policies. Until this new consensus is reached, volatility and uncertainty derived from geopolitics will endure,\u201d says Professor \u00c1ngel Saz, director of EsadeGeo.\n\n\u201cNext gen business leaders will have to internalize politics and policy into their business thinking and strategizing. When market rules are relegated to other political priorities \u2013 such as security, equality or sovereignty \u2013 policy logic takes over.\u201d\n\nThe table below shows a non-exhaustive roundup of geopolitical courses, degrees, research centers and other initiatives of select schools across Europe and Canada. (See a more detailed school-by-school breakout of geopolitical offerings and philosophies: 9 International Business Schools Where You Can Study Geopolitics)\n\nDON\u2019T MISS: 9 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SCHOOLS WHERE YOU CAN STUDY GEOPOLITICS\n\nNEXT PAGE: Student demand + Is this Europe\u2019s moment?\n\nAs part of the Global Manager Initiative course, Toronto-Rotman students supported Canadian companies on a trade mission at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March 2025. Another 16 MBAs and 8 Canadian companies will attend the IAA Mobility Conference in Munich in September.\n\nStudents seem to have gotten the message.\n\nAt ESSEC, more than 300 MIM students are enrolled in tracks with strong geopolitical components including international negotiation, defense, European affairs, and China\u2019s political economy.\n\n\u201cOur students recognize that understanding geopolitical dynamics is no longer optional, it\u2019s critical to leadership in an interconnected, unstable world,\u201d Colson says.\n\nThe most popular undergraduate dual degree at IE Business School is the BBA combined with a Bachelor in International Relations. That demand is strong enough that IE is now launching a second dual degree, BBA plus Political Science. Strategic foresight \u2013 the ability to analyze, understand, and predict forces of disruption \u2013 is one of three core pillars in the IE Brown Executive MBA and offered as a concentration in both IE\u2019s International MBA and Master in Management.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing significant and growing interest from students across all levels in geopolitics, foresight, and related areas,\u201d says Dean Lee Newman.\n\nAs an IE Global Executive MBA put it: \u201cFrom geopolitics and the unraveling of the global order, to AI-driven disruption and the future of ethics, democracy, and capitalism, we asked questions that don\u2019t have easy answers. But the times demand that we ask them anyway.\u201d\n\nThis year alone, Switzerland\u2019s IMD has developed 10 customized geopolitical programs for senior executive teams. It also launched \u201cGeopolitics Series: Navigating America\u2019s New Direction,\u201d to help executives interpret and respond to rapid shifts in U.S. domestic and foreign policy. The school has integrated geopolitics and security risk across its degree portfolio including its MBA, selected as Poets&Quants\u2019 2024 Program of the Year.\n\nResearch at IMD in Switzerland shows that 75% of corporate filings to the U.S. SEC in 2023 cited geopolitical risk as a factor in decision-making while trade barriers have doubled since 2020. \u201cProtectionism is now the American default, not a Trump-era detour,\u201d according to an analysis by Richard Baldwin, professor of international economics.\n\n\u201cThe next generation of business leaders will inherit a fundamentally different global operating environment than their predecessors \u2013 one where geopolitical considerations are permanently embedded in every strategic decision,\u201d says Misiek Piskorski, Dean of Executive Education and Professor of Digital Strategy, Analytics and Innovation at IMD.\n\n\u201cUnlike leaders who built careers during the era of seamless globalization, future executives will need to navigate a world of competing blocs, weaponized interdependence, and economic nationalism as the default rather than the exception.\u201d\n\nAt HEC\u2019s Paris MBA commencement in June, France\u2019s Minister for Foreign Affairs Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot stood before a sea of black gowns and blue sashes to passionately defend values U.S. universities once took for granted.\n\n\u201cWe stand for free and open science. We stand for academic freedom,\u201d said Barrott, who is an HEC Paris professor of finance on leave to serve as minister. He is also an HEC alumnus, earning a masters and his PhD there.\n\n\u201cFor there are places around the world, where a university is no longer a sanctuary, but an area of political control, where students protests can mean arrests, where classrooms may be watched, where a tweet can send a professor to jail, where books are removed from the shelves, where databases are erased, where research topics are forbidden, and where funding is used as political leverage.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s notable that he said this at a French university, not an American one. The Trump administration\u2019s sustained assault on US higher education undercut one of America\u2019s most effective tools of soft power: its universities\u2019 global reputation for academic freedom, openness, and free speech which for decades has attracted the best and the brightest students and faculty from around the world. That in turn, helped shape global business, science, and policy in ways that reinforced American influence.\n\n Trump\u2019s attacks are eroding that reputation with top research talent looking to relocate and international students rethinking their US applications.\n\nIs it Europe\u2019s time to claim the mantle?\n\nIn May, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron launched Choose Europe for Science, pledging \u20ac500 million through 2027 to position Europe as a global sanctuary for open research. France, Spain, Germany, and Austria have announced their own national versions of the initiative.\n\nManuel Mu\u00f1iz, provost of Spain\u2019s IE University, says that while it is premature to predict an irreversible decline in the US\u2019 academic leadership, it could mark the rise of a multipolar academic world.\n\n\u201cGlobal academic leadership is not a perpetual privilege. Other regions \u2013 including Europe, parts of Asia, and emerging economies \u2013 are investing substantially in their higher education systems and research capabilities,\u201d Mu\u00f1iz says.\n\n\u201cEurope can, and indeed must, serve as a sanctuary for open, pluralistic, and globally engaged intellectual inquiry.\u201d\n\nJagolinzer of Cambridge Judge agrees. He recently testified before the EU Parliament, describing the Trump administration\u2019s tactics as \u201cmilitary-grade hybrid.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will take at least a decade to recover because I sense they are just getting started,\u201d Jagolinzer says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve publicly stated that I sense this is intentional blunt-force trauma. My sense is that there is an insatiable appetite for pure capitulation.\u201d\n\nBack at HEC Paris, students there have engaged with geopolitics long before Trump, says Jeremy Ghez, professor of economics and decision sciences and co-director of the school\u2019s Center for Geopolitics. It integrates geopolitics through electives, systemic risk analysis, and a core Executive MBA course called Business Environment. The school just hosted its 10th summer school in Geopolitics, Globalization and Business Strategy and continues to position students at the center of global uncertainty.\n\nA large piece of that engagement is that HEC\u2019s student body is highly international. Close to 95% of its 2025 class were international, representing 49 different countries.\n\nBut Ghez says the engagement has shifted.\n\n\u201cI think the Trump game changer is that people just are increasingly and rightfully skeptical of the rule book,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the rule book is not as solid as it used to be \u2013 or is still being written to some extent \u2013 then you\u2019re going to have to show imagination. Open mindedness used to be the biggest clich\u00e9 that you could ever mention. Now they\u2019re starting to see the strategic importance of it.\u201d\n\nHe believes political choices made in Washington are opening doors elsewhere, including at European universities.\n\n\u201cThere is a kind of competition going on to the extent that political choices by this White House means opportunities for European institutions that they\u2019re looking to grab,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout a doubt.\u201d\n\nDON\u2019T MISS: 9 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SCHOOLS WHERE YOU CAN STUDY GEOPOLITICS\n\nThe post A New Geopolitics Push?

Pre-recorded sessions introduce participants to key concepts and principles to study at your own pace. This allows greater flexibility to maximize the experience on and off campus and respond to your personal study rhythm. In-person sessions take your learning to the next level through interactions with the professor and peers from around the world.\nOVERVIEW\nIn recent years, instability in the Middle East, the rise of populism and protectionism in the United States and in Europe and growing tensions in the South China Sea, among other crises, have reminded us of how relevant political and geopolitical risks remain for decision-makers, including those of the private sector. What seemed to be solid assumptions about how the world worked and how stable it was are now continuously challenged by events \u2013 predictable and unpredictable \u2013that can unfold very quickly. Perhaps even more crucially, geopolitics is not only a dimension of global risk but also a channel of contagion that can transform a sovereign or a liquidity crisis for instance into a worldwide, systemic failure of the international system. Some observers even wonder whether globalization, as a whole, may not come under challenge.\nThe real issue lies in drawing operational implications from geopolitical analysis for businesses and decision-makers. Business executives can become easily obsessed with their inboxes, and be tempted to micromanage, isolate issues and be excessively backward-looking in their analyses as a result. In the Geopolitics, Globalization and Business Strategy Summer School Program, participants will explore how geopolitics can help decision-makers broaden horizons and enrich their strategies by integrating in their thinking global political and macroeconomic issues.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\nA blended learning experience with pre-recorded sessions, face-to-face sessions, and group work for a comprehensive experience. Upon successful completion of the summer program, participants will be able to:\n- Understand the strategic landscape in which decisions are made;\n- Assess business risks and opportunities entailed by geopolitical dynamics;\n- Monitor changes in the international landscape, including the likelihood of low-probability and high-impact events (black swans);\n- Integrate geopolitical analysis in the firm\u2019s broader international and risk-mitigation strategies;\n- Develop a long-term, consistent strategy and vision, beyond mere day-to-day tactics.\nAssessment\nParticipants will be assessed based on the following:\n- presence and participation\n- group presentations\nParticipants who successfully complete the program will earn 5 ECTS credits. Full attendance is required to obtain the Program Certificate.\nAll students who are seeking credit are encouraged to consult their home academic institution to validate credit transfer."

      "text": "From consumers to code: America's audacious AI export move\nGlobal leaders should be wary of Washington\u2019s attempt to make its AI advantage the next global dependency....\nby Simon J. Evenett Published January 16, 2025 in Geopolitics \u2022 7 min read\nThis article is based on a related white paper by IMD, Boston Consulting Group and the World Economic Forum.\nIn today\u2019s volatile global landscape, the ability to discern and adapt to geopolitical shifts has become a business imperative. Now more than ever, companies are affected by geopolitical disruptions, from trade wars to sanctions, customer pressure to reconfigure supply chains, military conflict, and government turnover.\nThat geopolitics can harm companies with cross-border operations is no longer contested. An April 2024 study by analysts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that US export restrictions on certain technologies wiped $130bn off the stock market valuations of the affected American suppliers. Their employment and profitability also fell, highlighting the increasing necessity for businesses to move from reactive risk management to proactive geopolitical strategies.\nThe upshot: business leaders must develop sharper agility and foresight. Their ability to make informed decisions in this volatile environment hinges on the strength of their so-called geopolitical radar \u2013 their capacity to effectively track and assess these shifting dynamics. This was outlined in our recently published white paper \u2018From Blind Spots to Insights: Enhancing Geopolitical Radar to Guide Global Business,\u2019 the second edition of a three-part series published jointly by IMD, Boston Consulting Group, and the World Economic Forum.\nStaying on top of shifts in the global business environment always made sense for international business. Intensifying geopolitical rivalry upends parts of that environment and sophisticated firms are revising how they track and evaluate the ensuing threats and opportunities for their business. In short, upgrading their geopolitical radar to provide relevant, up-to-date insights for senior management is at a premium.\nCompanies sharpen their geopolitical radars by drawing on diverse sources, not only from mainstream English-speaking media but local news outlets, podcasts, and even fiction, to paint a holistic picture of the geopolitical landscape while avoiding selection bias. Several firms interviewed also highlighted the value of local offices as vital intelligence hubs.\nEngagement with customers and stakeholders can play a pivotal role too. One participant interviewed for this white paper emphasized tracking consumer sentiment, to identify reputational blowback stemming from geopolitical events. Others said they worked with local consultants to help refine their assessments, as well as engaged with think tanks and policymakers to provide insights into regulatory shifts and industrial policies.\nMany executives we spoke to recognized that this was a journey \u2013 requiring a fundamental shift in mindset, from relying on a backward-looking, experience-driven approach to embracing a more forward-looking way to track and assess geopolitics.\n\u201cTheir approaches ranged from establishing dedicated teams or working groups to holding frequent risk committee meetings dedicated to geopolitics.\u201d\nOnce a sound understanding of geopolitical drivers and events has been established, translating it into the \u201cso what?\u201d for senior executives and board members is a critical part of developing a commercially meaningful geopolitical radar. Today, systematically assessing how a company\u2019s operations are exposed to geopolitical factors should become standard practice \u2013 because it reveals in practical terms what\u2019s at stake.\nExposure analysis reveals how external geopolitical events affect current and potential future company performance if management stands pat and lets an external geopolitical event or trend wash over it.\nExposure analysis involves financial estimates, assessment of the impact on other performance metrics, and assessments of the impact on internal capabilities in affected geographies and business units. The purpose here is not an exact prediction. What matters is scaling the impact correctly. Does the fallout from a geopolitical event have a seven-digit, eight-digit, or nine-digit consequence for a business if no mitigating measures are taken?\nSome interviewees noted the importance of bringing the relevant people from across the firm together to assess impact. Their approaches ranged from establishing dedicated teams or working groups to holding frequent risk committee meetings dedicated to geopolitics.\nRarely can exposure analysis be done at arms-length \u2013 a firm must develop the needed internal capabilities and protocols. There\u2019s no assumption here that there\u2019s a one-size-fits-all solution in terms of how companies implement and operationalize their geopolitical radar.\nSeveral interviewees reported that their companies undertake scenario planning initiatives.\nAnother way companies are strengthening their geopolitical radars is by adopting methods that governments have employed for years, particularly when it comes to assessing the longer-term implications of geopolitical trends.\nSeveral interviewees reported that their companies also undertake scenario planning initiatives. Some acknowledged that they emulate the better practices of scenario planning employed by governments, international organizations, and leading independent experts in the field.\nOne interviewee noted that their company deploys an \u201ciceberg model\u201d to differentiate between geopolitical drivers and events to identify possible \u201cno-regret moves,\u201d in addition to informing strategy development.\nAnother interviewee emphasized the importance of articulating underlying assumptions, thinking through the possible sequences of outcomes and moves and associated feedback loops, and then assessing plausibility. Yet another interviewee called for imagination in identifying scenarios, which should draw from a wide range of sources, including fiction!\nIn turn, scenario planning initiatives can be augmented by gaming exercises of specific contingencies, most notably assessing the fallout following a potential escalated conflict in the Taiwan Strait.\nThe interviewed companies varied widely in how they communicated and preserved insights from geopolitical exposure analyses. Effective internal communication is critical for robust risk management. Some organizations rely on regular reporting cycles, such as quarterly updates, to brief senior management on geopolitical issues, while others share insights informally through ad hoc networks of executives with an interest in geopolitics.\nThese networks, however, tend to be fluid, and some companies have taken steps to integrate longer-term geopolitical scenario planning into their strategic processes. Few have established formal systems to store and track geopolitical developments and related assessments. All too often, whatever institutional memory there is relies heavily on the retention of individual team members, creating key person risks. In short, geopolitical radars require more systematic approaches to knowledge management.\nWithout a dedicated team, there is a risk that existing practices within a department influence what gets tracked and assessed.\nThe blurred line between geopolitical factors and general corporate political risks creates challenges in determining who oversees a company\u2019s geopolitical radar. Our interviews revealed a range of approaches, with responsibility spread across compliance, strategy, government affairs, sourcing, legal teams, and sometimes dedicated geopolitical units.\nWithout a dedicated team, there is a risk that existing practices within a department influence what gets tracked and assessed. For example, compliance teams may focus narrowly on adhering to sanctions and miss nascent geopolitical developments. Meanwhile, strategy teams might lack detailed insights from experts in operational units such as sourcing. Establishing a dedicated team helps centralize efforts but still requires input from across the organization, such as observations CEOs glean from engaging with policymakers and local managers that track on-the-ground developments.\nIntegrating geopolitical assessments into enterprise risk management (ERM) systems is increasingly common, but many ERM teams struggle with the less quantifiable nature of geopolitical risks compared to financial risks. Addressing this gap requires a collaborative, forward-thinking approach that ensures geopolitical insights are shared and acted upon effectively.\nThere is considerable interest in how firms with extensive cross-border operations are reacting to intensifying rivalry between governments in a multipolar world. Understanding how international businesses seek to capitalize on opportunities in a global economy shaped by increasing security considerations is of interest not only to corporate executives but also to analysts, officials, and critical stakeholders, such as customers and investors. Developing a robust geopolitical radar is a critical initial step. Ships and airplanes need radars \u2013 so do international businesses.\nMoving from an experience-driven, backward-looking identification of geopolitical risks to forward-focused tracking of geopolitical dynamics will shift decision-making from a reactive to a proactive posture \u2013 and could surface significant opportunities. Achieving this will require a deeper understanding of the drivers of such geopolitical dynamics. Armed with these insights, senior management is better placed to navigate geopolitics.\nEnsuring that the internal geopolitical function overcomes legacy attitudes, supports institutional memory, reduces key person risk, and facilitates timely information sharing are part and parcel of effective geopolitical radars. Done right, this critical capability could itself become a source of competitive advantage \u2013 and possibly a core competence as well.\nClick here to view the related white paper.\nProfessor of Geopolitics and Strategy at IMD\nSimon J.
