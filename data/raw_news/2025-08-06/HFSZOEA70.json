      "text": "Invest in the best tech stocks today with Webull or Robinhood.\nThe technology sector is made up of companies that operate in the semiconductor, artificial intelligence (AI), software, computer hardware, and other industries related to information technology. This sector includes some of the world\u2019s most well-known and largest companies, such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia.\nStocks in the tech sector, which are holistically represented by the Invesco S&P 500\u00ae Equal Weight Tech ETF (RYT), have gone down with the rest of the market as RYT has provided investors with a return of -18% over the past 12 months.\nHere are the top technology stocks with the highest growth, greatest value, strongest momentum, and most searches on Google.\nBest Technology Stocks Right Now\nStock Movers\nGainers\n| Ticker | Company | \u00b1% | Buy Stock | |||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\nNo Results |\nLoser\n| Ticker | Company | \u00b1% | Buy Stock | |||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\nNo Results |\nWhat are Tech Stocks?\nFrom 2007 to 2017, the tech industry zoomed from $65.2 billion to $263.6 billion. However, this phenomenal growth in the tech sector doesn\u2019t come without risks. Innovations constantly cause disruptions within the market. For example, in 2007, the introduction of the iPhone created many new businesses and ruined others. It caused the tech industry to evolve into what it is today.\nThis sector offers more than just sturdy mega-cap stocks and household brands like Amazon. The tech sector niche includes companies of all sizes, including start-ups. You must do your research to successfully invest in tech stocks.\nBest Online Brokers for Tech Stock\nA good online broker can make investing and trading tech stocks more efficient and can help you be more successful. Here are some great online brokers you should consider.\n- Best For:Active and Global TradersVIEW PROS & CONS:Securely through Interactive Brokers\u2019 website\n- Best For:Active Short Sellers With Modest CapitalVIEW PROS & CONS:securely through TradeZero's website\nFeatures to Look for in Tech Stocks\nHere are the top features investors should look for before investing in technology stocks.\n- Profitability: Hands down, the best way to determine whether you should buy a particular stock is to get a firm grasp on whether it can turn a profit. Look at its profitability ratios to find out how it stacks up.\n- Total addressable market (TAM): The total addressable market (TAM) reveals the maximum amount of money a company can earn in a select market \u2014 provided a company has 100% of the market share.\n- Growth capacity: When a company is in the process of releasing a new product, a new customer segment or plans to cross-sell an existing product to customers, you want to evaluate the company\u2019s potential growth capacity.\n- Revenue: Look at a company\u2019s operating revenue and nonoperating revenue and what tech companies make from their core business (operating revenue) and one-time business activities (nonoperating revenue). You\u2019ll want to carefully consider both before you pull the trigger on a tech stock.\nThings to Consider With Technology Stocks\nAs you look at a tech company, you should take pause when you run across certain issues. These issues might not prevent you from buying, but you need to know how certain tech startups, artificial intelligence outfits, semiconductor companies, etc operate. If you can\u2019t find good information, you may want to move on. Remember, the stock price is just one step in reading what\u2019s going on with Wall Street. The rest is buried in these little details:\nProducts\nWhen you invest in a company, it should have products that you can see people or businesses using. Sure, a chatbot or new style of wearables is cool, but do they have potential to grab some marketshare?\nVenture Capital\nWhere is the money coming from? Big tech companies don\u2019t need endless investment, but a new software company has developers and venture investors to satisfy. If the company isn\u2019t performing well, it could burn through its funding. Would it still be a good investment when it\u2019s behind schedule and over-budget?\nThe Supply Chain\nThe supply chain hits everyone from semiconductor companies to cloud computing firms and everyone in between. Venture capital investment can pay for the supplies, but if those supplies never come, what next? The parent company may need to put projects on hold, the company could go under or it could be delisted in a worst-case scenario. So, if cars are running low on semiconductors or parts, your favorite tech ventures could be struggling, too.\nPutting Tech Stocks in Perspective\nThe technology sector can attract you with its stability and growth potential. Investigate tech stocks\u2019 potential to expose you to lucrative returns.\nTo find other top-performing stocks see below:\nCompare online brokers, here are some of Benzinga's favorites:\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAre tech stocks a good investment?\nTech stocks add more risk to ones portfolio, however, this risk can come along with high returns. Keep in mind tech stocks may be more volatile in a bear market.\nAre all tech stocks the same?\nNo, the tech sector has many segments, and you need to decide which segment is best for your trading strategy.\nShould you hold tech stocks?\nMany tech stocks could grow so much that you can hold them for many years to come, but that\u2019s not true of every tech stock. Research your tech assets carefully to learn how much they can grow over time."
