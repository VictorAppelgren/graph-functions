      "feedback": "The draft hits the structural requirements (four movers in two Up / two Down, plus a Swing Trade line), but it overreaches the constraints and weakens world‑class quality through loose probabilities, sprawling prose, and mixed assets. Concrete, high‑signal edits to lift it:\n\n- Tighten the Movers to a strict, first‑principles, four‑line map that maps cleanly to the regime/story and uses precise, data‑driven watches. Each line should pair a single driving thread (base case/Regime A, bear, bull, tail risk) with a concrete market observable from the material (e.g., MSFTAzure growth +39% (GX057ADL7); Shopify GMV momentum (GX057ADL7); aging/health‑care cost tail risks (4, IGP1Q4ZEJ); tariff pass‑through dynamics (S15934PBQ)) and a numeric watch where possible. Avoid aggregating multiple, unmerged drivers in one line; keep 1 crisp mechanism per line and a single, verifiable watch phrase.\n\n- Fix probability treatment. The current 65/60/55/52% figures are not explicit evidence in the material. Either (a) convert them to evidence‑backed, regime‑weighted probabilities (e.g., “Base‑case ~60% given Regime A ease; Bear ~25% on persistent inflation/tariffs; Bull ~15% on AI capex acceleration”) with no separate, unsupported numbers, or (b) anchor each probability to a concrete, sourced datum (and place the citation next to the fact, not the probability). If you keep probabilities, add a short line tying each to the cited evidence and avoid mixing several unanchored claims in one line.\n\n- Align the Swing Trade line to a single tradable asset and a crisp, actionable risk framework. The current draft uses MSFT in the trade line, which is fine, but ensure the line reads exactly as required: Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100, with a single MSFT breakout trigger, a concrete stop, and a defensible R/R (and a sourced rationale for the probability and confidence). If you want the watchwords to reflect the movers, tie the trigger to the same data point you cited for MSFT (Azure growth) and keep the risk controls tight (e.g., stop below prior swing low).\n\n- Eliminate nonessential sections and tighten to format. The prompt requires exactly four movers lines and at most 1–2 swing/Outlook lines. The current draft contains extended narrative sections (0–3 weeks thesis, near‑term data points, multi‑paragraph base case, etc.). Remove those sections or condense into one brief, sourced outlook line, so the deliverable remains strictly within the required length/format and avoids filler.\n\n- Sharpen the “What to watch” and add concrete, source‑anchored triggers. Replace generic phrasing with precise, cited signals: e.g., “MSFT Azure growth +39% (GX057ADL7)” as a watchpoint; “Shopify GMV share >12% of US e‑commerce signal network effects (GX057ADL7)” as a corroborating data point; “core CPI trajectory” with the exact data you intend to monitor (S15934PBQ) and a threshold if permissible by the material. This improves numerical rigor and traceability.\n\n- Improve coherence and reconciliation of conflicts. If you keep a bear/bull/base framing, explicitly label each mover with the regime it tests and note any tensions among sources (e.g., inflation persistence vs policy easing; aging health costs vs cloud/AI monetization). A brief, sourced sentence that acknowledges these tensions will improve credibility without bloating the format.\n\n- Citation discipline and source coverage. Ensure each factual anchor within the movers lines has a matching in‑line ID from the SOURCE MATERIAL (IDs like GX057ADL7, S15934PBQ, IGP1Q4ZEJ, 0G3A676BP, etc.). Do not cite facts in the probabilities; keep citations tightly bound to specific numeric claims or verifiable facts. If multiple sources support a single watch, cite both, but avoid stringing many IDs loosely in one line.\n\n- If you want to preserve the broad regime narrative, compress it into a one‑line outlook: Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100, anchored to a single, defensible read (e.g., Regime A with AI moats driving MSFT/Shopify, conditional on inflation staying near target and tariffs remaining contained). Then present the Swing Trade line as a single, crisp instrument entry.\n\nIn short: restructure to four crisp, first‑principles movers with single drivers and concrete, data‑driven watches; ground all factual claims in the provided IDs; remove extraneous material to meet the exact 4‑line mover + 1–2 line swing/outlook format; fix probabilities to be evidence‑based or clearly caveated; and tighten the Swing Trade into a single, well‑justified MSFT setup with a precise risk framework.",
