Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov tried to defend his country\u2019s assault on Ukraine under sharp questioning from Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker, with Welker eventually asking, \u201cEither the Russian military has terrible aim or you are targeting civilians. Which is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis week, Russia escalated its attacks in Ukraine,\u201d Welker said at the start of the interview. \u201cJust this week. Russia bombed an American-owned factory near the Hungarian border. I\u2019ve spoken to people who, frankly, see that as a slap in the face to President Trump, to the entire peace process. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nLavrov said that Russia \u201cnever, ever\u2026 deliberately targeted any sites which are not linked to military abilities of Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an electronics factory though, sir. This is an electronics factory. I\u2019ve spoken to people on the ground there. It builds coffee machines, among other electronics. This is not a military site,\u201d Welker responded.\n\nTrump has told the press he expressed displeasure to Putin over the drone attack on the American-owned plant. \u201cI told him I\u2019m not happy about it,\u201d Trump said Friday. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not happy about anything having to do with that war.\u201d\n\nTrump and Putin recently met at a summit in Alaska, but no tangible progress toward peace appears to have come from the meeting, despite the administration\u2019s attempts to spin it as a success.\n\nThe president said on Friday that he would know more about progress toward a Ukraine-Russia agreement in two weeks. \u201cOver the next two weeks we\u2019re gonna find out which way it\u2019s going to go, and I better be very happy,\u201d he said. (Trump loves to claim that complex, intractable problems will be solved \u201cin two weeks.\u201d)\n\nUnder Welker\u2019s questioning, Lavrov stood firm in his stance that somehow an American-owned factory was producing equipment for Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI understand that some people are really naive and when they see a coffee machine in the window, they believe that this is the place where coffee machines are produced,\u201d he said. \u201cOur intelligence has very good information, and we target only \u2014 as I said \u2014 either military enterprises, military sites or industrial enterprises directly involved in producing military equipment for Ukrainian army.\u201d\n\nBut Welker continued to press. \u201cMr. Foreign Minister, here are the facts: close to 50,000 civilians have either been killed or injured in this war,\u201d she said. \u201cRussia has hit maternity wards, churches, schools, hospitals, a kindergarten just this past week. So either the Russian military has terrible aim or you are targeting civilians. Which is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, look, NBC is a very respectful structure, and I hope you are responsible for the words which you broadcast,\u201d Lavrov said, getting testy. \u201cI ask you to send us or to publicize the information to which you just referred because we never targeted the civilian targets of the kind you cited. You might be mixing, you know, the information because it is a fact that quite a number of churches were purposefully hit by the Ukrainian regime.\u201d\n\nLavrov continued by asking for proof. Welker said that \u201cwe have reporters on the ground who\u2019ve seen it with their own eyes.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s assaults on civilians appear to be escalating. According to the United Nations, this past June saw the highest number of civilian casualties in the three years of the ongoing conflict. Two hundred and eighty-six civilians were killed, while another 1,674 were injured, the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission (HRMMU) in Ukraine said.\n\nThe U.N. has documented a total of 13,883 civilian deaths, including 726 children, since the war began. Another 35,548 civilians have been injured, including 2,234 children.\n\n\u201cWhether you are in a hospital or a prison, at home or at work, close to or far away from the frontline, if you are in Ukraine today, you are at risk of getting killed or injured by the war,\u201d Danielle Bell, head of HRMMU said. \u201cThe risk is significantly higher than last year and it continues to rise.\u201d\n\u2022 None Jim Jordan Says He Believes Ghislaine Maxwell.

      "text": "Summary\n\u2022 With at least 1,674 civilian casualties (286 killed; 1,388 injured), the number of civilian casualties continued to rise in July, setting a new record for monthly overall casualties since May 2022.1 In July 2025, 22.5 per cent more civilians were killed or injured than in July 2024.\n\u2022 The increase in the number of civilian casualties between June and July 2025 mainly took place in areas controlled by the Government of Ukraine along the frontline, reflecting intensive military efforts by Russian armed forces to capture territory. Aerial bombs dropped by Russian armed forces accounted for the largest increase in civilian casualties with 276 casualties (67 killed; 209 injured) in July 2025 compared with 114 (34 killed; 80 injured) in June 2025.\n\u2022 While the number of casualties from long-range strikes with missiles and loitering munitions decreased by about 20 per cent in July compared with June 2025, they continued to pose a significant threat to civilians, causing almost 40 per cent of all civilian casualties, including in urban centres such as Kyiv, Dnipro and Kharkiv.\n\u2022 Short-range drones were the second leading cause of civilian casualties, after long-range weapons, accounting for 24 per cent of the casualties (64 killed; 337 injured)2.\n\u2022 Like in previous month, the vast majority of civilian casualties (98 per cent)3 occurred in areas controlled by the Government of Ukraine. Civilian casualties were recorded across 18 regions of Ukraine and the city of Kyiv.\n1 Based on data verified by HRMMU, July 2025 has seen the highest overall number of civilian casualties since May 2022 (1,741 civilian casualties: 589 killed and 1,152 injured).\n2 For an analysis of the use of short-range drones in Ukraine, see: The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Deadly drones: Civilians at risk from short-range drones in frontline areas of Ukraine, 24 February 2022 \u2014 30 April 2025, 26 June 2025.\n3 1,637 civilian casualties in territory controlled by Ukraine and 37 in territory occupied by the Russian Federation."

      "text": "Kyiv, 13 August 2025 \u2013 The number of civilian casualties in Ukraine reached another three-year high in July, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said today as it released its update on the protection of civilians.\nWith 286 civilians killed and 1,388 injured, the July casualty number was the highest since May 2022, topping also those for June 2025. HRMMU verified civilian casualties in 18 of the country\u2019s 24 regions in July.\n\u201cFor the second month in a row, the number of civilian casualties in Ukraine hits a new three-year high,\u201d said Danielle Bell, Head of HRMMU. \u201cOnly the first three months after the Russian Federation launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine saw more killed and injured than in this past month.\u201d\nThe use of long-range weapons such as missiles and loitering munitions accounted for nearly 40 per cent of the casualties \u2013 89 killed and 572 injured. On 31 July, for example, a missile and loitering munitions attack on Kyiv caused the highest verified number of civilian casualties in the capital since the start of the full-scale invasion, with 31 people killed and 171 injured. The majority of those killed, including five children, were in a residential building that was struck by a missile.\nThe increase, however, in civilian casualty numbers in July compared with the previous month mainly took place in areas controlled by the Government of Ukraine along the frontline, reflecting intensive military efforts by Russian armed forces to capture territory.\nShort-range drones were the second cause of civilian casualties, accounting for 24 per cent of the casualties \u2013 64 killed and 337 injured. Casualties from short-range drones have significantly increased since July 2024, as documented in a bulletin published by HRMMU in June 2025.\nAerial bombs dropped by Russian armed forces accounted for the largest increase in civilian casualties with 276 casualties (67 killed and 209 injured) in July 2025 compared with 114 (34 killed and 80 injured) in June 2025. On 28 July, for example, aerial bombs struck a penal colony in Bilenke, Zaporizhzhia region, killing 16 prisoners and injuring at least 43, all men. In another example, an aerial bomb struck an apartment building in Kramatorsk, Donetsk region, killing at least five civilians, on 31 July.\nThe high July casualty numbers continued a pattern of steadily increasing civilian casualties in 2025, HRMMU said. Casualty numbers for the first seven months of 2025 were 48 per cent higher than in the same period in 2024.\n\u201cWhether you are in a hospital or a prison, at home or at work, close to or far away from the frontline, if you are in Ukraine today, you are at risk of getting killed or injured by the war,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThe risk is significantly higher than last year and it continues to rise.\u201d\nSince the Russian Federation launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, HRMMU has documented the deaths of at least 13,883 civilians, including 726 children, and 35,548 injured, including 2,234 children."

      "text": "The Useful Idiots New Guide to the Most Stoned Moments of the 2020 Presidential Campaign\nSince we released the first edition of this list in early December, the news cycle has taken several hectic turns.\nThe president was impeached, and responded by issuing \u201cofficial movement permits\u201d to Santa Claus and his nine reindeer, so they could legally enter the United States (not a joke!). The U.S. embassy in Baghdad was overwhelmed, and we assassinated Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, a move Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described as a holiday present to the people of Iran (\u201cWe view the American action last night as giving them freedom\u201d).\nIn the campaign, onetime \u201cmomentum\u201d hopeful Julian Castro joined Kamala Harris, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Joe Sestak, Mark Sanford (you ask: who?) and others in the candidate glue factory. While Bernie Sanders posted boffo fundraising numbers and Joe Biden continued a stubborn claim on frontrunner status, news stories about primary-season \u201canxiety,\u201d \u201cfears\u201d and \u201cangst\u201d of Democrats multiplied. Nobody seems to know who is going to win, and insiders even seem torn on whom they want to win.\nThat anxiety has rippled down to the candidates, who are producing record amounts of bizarre campaign B roll, and we\u2019re chronicling it here. On each week\u2019s episode of Useful Idiots, Katie Halper and I recount the \u201cMost Stoned Moments\u201d of the presidential campaign: the video or scene from the trail that most made you feel like you\u2019ve been getting high all day. We then ask viewers to vote on which was the most stoned of these moments via Twitter polls. We started with ten entries: It\u2019s now up to fifteen, with the order re-arranged. Please note that we are trying hard to prevent this from becoming a Joe Biden tribute page.\nUpdated January 10th, 2020. Check out this week\u2019s episode, which featured an interview with Nina Turner, to get the full discussion. New entries marked:\n- MIKE BLOOMBERG: \u201cGET A DICTIONARY\u201d\nFormer New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent more than $147 million on ads already and has made great progress: his ads \u201cfound their way\u201d onto \u201cwhatever screens\u201d New York magazine columnist Jonathan Chait\u2019s kids look at. Minecraft instructional video demographic locked up!\nMeanwhile, when asked if Bernie Sanders was correct in terming the killing of Soleimani an \u201cassassination,\u201d Bloomberg snapped, \u201cIf he was talking about killing the general\u2026 this is a guy who had an awful lot of American blood on his hands, I think that\u2019s an outrageous thing to say.\u201d Pressed: but is it the right word? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean, get a dictionary.\u201d It usually takes candidates a year to go full Grumpy-Gus. Also, was he reaching for the name Qassem Soleimani when he retreated to the term, \u201cthe general\u201d?\nWhen asked if he would call Suleimani's death an assassination (by @alexrego_tweets) @MikeBloomberg said \"that's an outrageous thing to say.\" On the proper way to speak about his death, MB \"I don't know, get a dictionary and take your pick.\" https://t.co/JMOgO4zqVd pic.twitter.com/38IfwjTELP\n\u2014 Tim Perry (@tperry518) January 3, 2020\n- JOE BIDEN CHANGES SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM ALONG VENEZUELA-BOLIVIA \u201cBORDER\u201d\n\u201cIn Venezuela right now, what are we doing? Being irresponsible,\u201d said Joe Biden, in an interview with the Des Moines Register. \u201cYou know what\u2019s happening? Millions of people are crossing the border, destabilizing Bolivia.\u201d The Register interviewers showed admirable game faces in not reacting, or else they weren\u2019t aware Bolivia and Venezuela are separated by the Brazilian land mass.\nBiden says people are crossing Venezuela\u2019s border into Bolivia, which is actually 100s of miles awayhttps://t.co/eYG6twWAuy pic.twitter.com/JgAi8aVGqj\n\u2014 RNC Research (@RNCResearch) December 28, 2019\n- DONALD TRUMP: \u201cTOLEREITED\u201d\nThe headline in Spin summed it up: \u201cDonald Trump slurs and snorts through speech about Iranian missile strike.\u201d Much was made of the president\u2019s sniffing (58 times, @bubbaprog proclaimed!) and his rambling speech, which included word attempts like tolereited, accompliments, and the Charles Barkleyan turrrist. Hard to say whether the actual speech or the free-ranging pharmaceutical speculations on social media were more bizarre, but Useful Idiots viewers voted this more stoned than Biden\u2019s \u201cObamcare\u201d speech.\n- JOE BIDEN: \u201cNO ONE UNDERSTOOD OBAMACARE\u201d\nVintage, vintage Joe Biden in Washington, Iowa on December 28th. A man in a flannel shirt stood up in Q&A and asked why his father had to change his insurance to a more expensive plan after Obamacare, after Barack Obama promised this would not happen. \u201cSince you supported the plan, were you lying to my Dad?\u201d the man asked.\nBiden first mumbled a word-association-type response that sounded like, \u201cLying dog-faced pony show.\u201d Then he went on a long diatribe about the ins and outs of health care reform, saying ultimately: \u201cWell, because people, there\u2019s two ways people know when something is important,\u201d he continued. \u201cOne, when it\u2019s so clear when it\u2019s passed that everybody understands it \u2013 and no one did understand Obamacare, including the way it was rolled out.\u201d\n- JOE BIDEN\u2019S EYE FILLS WITH BLOOD\n\u201cWhat China\u2019s doing, they\u2019re building coal plants on their\u2026 their belt road era,\u201d said frontrunner Joe Biden in a town hall in September, while audience members leaned forward and frowned: what the hell is that? Americans soon learned the term \u201csubconjunctival hemorrhage,\u201d and learned that a former Vice President\u2019s eye can become engorged with blood if he rubs too much or \u201csneezes, coughs, strains while using the toilet, or otherwise experiences a spike in blood pressure.\u201d Update: former Obama doctor David Scheiner told the Washington Examiner in late December that Biden was \u201cnot a healthy guy.\u201d\n- KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: \u201cI\u2019M JUST TRYING TO GET SOME RANCH.\u201d\nThe 2020 race has seen some unusually painful candidate efforts to \u201cseem relatable,\u201d including a ghastly episode involving former New York Mayor Bill de Blasio in which he posted text messages with his son Dante, asking him how to come off as cool in a debate (Dante suggested he should \u201cclarify some NBA trade rumors\u201d). Few were more panned, however, than early-exit candidate Kirsten Gillibrand posting a video of herself lifting weights while wearing a specially-printed self-referential t-shirt that read, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get some ranch.\u201d The shirt referred to a non-memorable episode in which Gillibrand earlier in the campaign had, in a restaurant, approached a woman who was actually trying to get past her to get some salad dressing. \u201cDo you like my new workout shirt/\u201d Gillibrand\u2019s tweet read.\nGood to be back in Iowa.

The Texan-who-almost-but-didn\u2019t-beat-Ted-Cruz was a pioneer in Too Much Information campaigning, sharing visits to the dentist, solo drum sessions, and, most stoned of all, a visit to a barber that included an electric neck massage and commentary about dude\u2019s ear hair. Update: Politico put Beto last in a list of Democratic hopefuls who \u201clost it best,\u201d saying his presidential campaign \u201cincinerated his future in electoral politics.\u201d\n- DONALD TRUMP: \u201cWE DON\u2019T WANT TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT\u201d\nThis will be less funny later in the race when someone is pummeled to death under a pile of MAGA hats, but Donald Trump is already reprising his \u201cDid he really just say that shit?\u201d routine from 2016. In Hershey, Pennsylvania, a woman heckled Trump and was politely escorted out by security, prompting Trump to mock the guard: \u201cThat particular guy wanted to be so politically correct, oh-oh-oh!\u201d he said, recalling his Serge Kovaleski mime. Then, to a cheering crowd, he said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be politically correct!\u201d Update: when Fox News had Adam Schiff and James Comey on in mid-December, Trump blasted the station: \u201cFox is trying sooo hard to be politically correct!\u201d\n- ELIZABETH WARREN: \u201cI\u2019M GONNA GET ME A BEER.\u201d\nThe Massachusetts Senator and almost-frontrunner has pushed the envelope on the relatability-attempt front, slipping out of Harvard-speak and into Okie homilies about home and Mama with regularity. Here she posts a video of herself appearing to \u201cenjoy\u201d a beer-like beverage with her familial sharing unit, who amusingly declines. Update: press focus on Warren\u2019s \u201crelatability\u201d redoubled after a diffidently-received attempt at dancing, coupled with online activity surrounding her revelation that she does not wash her face (she does use Pond\u2019s cream twice a day).\n- MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: \u201cCORY IS VERY WELL-SPOKEN.\u201d\nThe New York Mayor, who spent a staggering $100 million on ads in the first few weeks of his campaign (earning about 5% in polls for his trouble), spoke on CBS about fellow Tri-Stater Cory Booker, who noted there will be twice as many billionaires on stage at the next Democratic debate as minorities. \u201cHe\u2019s very well-spoken, has got some good ideas,\u201d Bloomberg said. It wasn\u2019t quite \u201carticulate and bright and clean,\u201d but it was close. Update: Booker said he was \u201ctaken aback\u201d by Bloomberg\u2019s comment, which played into \u201cproblematic\u201d tropes. Bloomberg apologized.\nhttps://twitter.com/shaunking/status/1202944734534262784\n- JOE BIDEN: \u201cLEARN HOW TO PROGRAM. FOR GOD\u2019S SAKE!\u201d\nIn a town hall in Derry, New Hampshire, the ex-Veep scolded the post-NAFTA workforce for not reinventing itself. \u201cAnybody who can go down 3,000 feet in a mine can sure as hell learn to program as well,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody who can throw coal into a furnace can learn how to program, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Useful Idiots viewers voted this the most stoned recent episode of the campaign.\nBut Biden returns to the same point: \"Anybody who can throw coal into a furnace can learn how to program, for God's sake!\"\n\u2014 David Weigel (@daveweigel) December 30, 2019\n- JOE BIDEN: \u201cWHAT YOU DO HERE IN IOWA\u201d\nIt might be worth keeping track of how may times Joe Biden misidentifies the state in which he is currently standing. In Keene, New Hampshire, he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s not to like about Vermont?\u201d Then in Nashua, New Hampshire, while pacing in front of a sign that read BIDEN NEW HAMPSHIRE, he said, \u201cWhat you do here in Iowa\u2026\u201d On Useful Idiots, we discussed the concept of being \u201cBidenized,\u201d with John Kerry being one of the first to formally earn the dubious honor.

      "text": "Anatomy of a Fake News Scandal\nThis story was reported in partnership with The Investigative Fund and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting. Additional reporting: Aaron Sankin, Laura Starecheski, Michael Corey, Jaime Longoria and Jasper Craven.\nThe revelations overcame Edgar Maddison Welch like a hallucinatory fever. On December 1st, 2016, the father of two from Salisbury, North Carolina, a man whose pastimes included playing Pictionary with his family, tried to persuade two friends to join a rescue mission. Alex Jones, the Info-Wars host, was reporting that Hillary Clinton was sexually abusing children in satanic rituals a few hundred miles north, in the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant. Welch told his friends the \u201craid\u201d on a \u201cpedo ring\u201d might require them to \u201csacrifice the lives of a few for the lives of many.\u201d A friend texted, \u201cSounds like we r freeing some oppressed pizza from the hands of an evil pizza joint.\u201d Welch was undeterred. Three days later, armed with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, a .38 handgun and a folding knife, he strolled into the restaurant and headed toward the back, where children were playing ping-pong. As waitstaff went table to table, whispering to customers to get out, Welch maneuvered into the restaurant\u2019s kitchen. He shot open a lock and found cooking supplies. He whipped open another door and found an employee bringing in fresh pizza dough. Welch did not find any captive children \u2013 Comet Ping Pong does not even have a basement \u2013 but he did prove, if there were any lingering doubts after the election, that fake news has real consequences.\nWelch\u2019s arrest was the culmination of an election cycle dominated by fake news \u2013 and by attacks on the legitimate press. Several media outlets quickly traced the contours of what became known as Pizzagate: The claim that Hillary Clinton was a pedophile started in a Facebook post, spread to Twitter and then went viral with the help of far-right platforms like Breitbart and Info-Wars. But it was unclear whether Pizzagate was mass hysteria or the work of politicos with real resources and agendas. It took the better part of a year (and two teams of researchers) to sift through the digital trail. We found ordinary people, online activists, bots, foreign agents and domestic political operatives. Many of them were associates of the Trump campaign. Others had ties with Russia. Working together \u2013 though often unwittingly \u2013 they flourished in a new \u201cpost-truth\u201d information ecosystem, a space where false claims are defended as absolute facts. What\u2019s different about Pizzagate, says Samuel Woolley, a leading expert in computational propaganda, is it was \u201cretweeted and picked up by some of the most powerful faces of American politics.\u201d\nThe original Pizzagate Facebook post appeared on the evening of October 29th, 2016, a day after then-FBI Director James Comey announced that the bureau would be reopening its investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server while secretary of state. Data from the server had been found on electronics belonging to former Rep. Anthony Weiner (the husband of Clinton\u2019s close aide Huma Abedin), who had been caught texting lewd messages to a 15-year-old. On Facebook, a user named Carmen Katz wrote, \u201cMy NYPD source said its much more vile and serious than classified material on Weiner\u2019s device. The email DETAIL the trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary on their pedophile billionaire friend\u2019s plane, the Lolita Express. Yup, Hillary has a well documented predilection for underage girls. . . . We\u2019re talking an international child enslavement and sex ring.\u201d\nKatz\u2019s Facebook profile listed her residence as Joplin, Missouri. With a link to a story headlined \u201cBreaking: Hillary Clinton strategy memo leaked: \u2018Steal yard signs,\u2019 \u201d Katz posted, \u201cYou know how we handle yard sign theft or tampering in South Missouri? With a 3 prong garden hoe buried in the middle of the back.\u201d We found no record of anyone with the name Carmen Katz in the entire state. But searching through her online activity, we noticed another clue: Every time she posted petitions on Change.org, such as \u201cPut Donald Trump\u2018s Face on Mount Rushmore,\u201d the last signer was invariably Cynthia Campbell of Joplin. Campbell used the same profile picture as \u201cCarmen Katz\u201d on Facebook \u2013 that is, the same snapshot of the same cat.\nFor more than 20 years, a 60-year-old attorney named Cynthia Campbell has practiced law out of her bungalow-style home in Joplin. In April, I began trying to contact her, asking if she was behind the initial Pizzagate post. Within days, the Carmen Katz Facebook account disappeared. I went to Campbell\u2019s house to try in person. A large NRA sticker adorned the screen door; on the porch was feline statuary and gardening equipment, including a three-pronged hoe. She didn\u2019t answer but later texted and called me. Campbell said yes, she set up the Facebook account, but it was hacked two or three years ago. She never explicitly denied posting the comment that started Pizzagate. Instead, she told me to disregard the NRA sticker \u2013 she just \u201csupports hunting.\u201d She also claimed to be a rare Democrat in southwest Missouri. \u201cYou don\u2019t say much,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t stick signs out.\u201d\nSocial-media accounts are routinely- hacked, but the next morning, when Campbell texted me 21 times, she sounded every bit like the user behind the original Carmen Katz post. \u201cStalking and harassing innocent people who have done nothing to you is wrong, evil and illegal,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou should be helping people get their lives and health back going through such nightmares, not piling on, harassing them, making them feel unsafe and preyed upon.\u201d She threatened to report me to both the ACLU and Best Buy\u2019s Geek Squad.\n\u201c[P]eople like you don\u2019t give a shit that you destroy innocent humans\u2019 lives,\u201d she said. \u201cGo back to your soul-sucking job. . . . You are fake news!\u201d\nIt strains the imagination to think how Campbell \u2013 a cat lady in Missouri \u2013 had pieced together not only the story that Clinton was a sex-trafficking pedophile, but its details: NYPD officials, Weiner\u2019s laptop, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s private jet. According to Clint Watts, a cyber and homeland-security expert at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, Katz fits neatly into a well-worn blueprint for disinformation campaigns. For a story to gain traction, propagandists plant false information on anonymous chat boards, hoping real people will pick it up and add a \u201chuman touch\u201d to acts of digital manipulation. \u201cIf you want to sow a conspiracy, you seed it someplace \u2013 4chan or Reddit is a perfect vehicle,\u201d he says, and wait for someone like Katz to take the bait. \u201cSomeone or some group,\u201d Watts says, \u201cpossibly took this unwitting woman and made her the source that they need.\u201d\nOn a pair of anonymous message boards, we found several possible seeds of Pizzagate. On July 2nd, 2016, someone calling himself FBIAnon, who claimed to be a \u201chigh-level analyst and strategist\u201d for the bureau, hosted an Ask Me Anything forum on 4chan. He claimed to be leaking government secrets \u2013 \u00e1 la Edward Snowden \u2013 out of a love for country, but it wasn\u2019t always clear which country he meant. At various times, he wrote, \u201cRussia is more a paragon of freedom and nationalism than any other country\u201d and \u201cWe are the aggressors against Russia.\u201d FBIAnon\u2019s secrets were about the Department of Justice\u2019s inquiry into the Clinton Foundation, which federal prosecutors never formalized. \u201cDig deep,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBill and Hillary love foreign donors so much. They get paid in children as well as money.\u201d\n\u201cDoes Hillary have sex with kidnapped girls?\u201d a 4channer asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d FBIAnon answered.\nAnother possible germ of Pizzagate appeared online about 10 hours before Katz posted her story on Facebook. TheeRANT describes itself as a message board for \u201cNew York City cops speaking their minds.\u201d Virtually everyone on the site uses an identity-masking screen name. Favorite topics include police body cameras (bad) and George Soros (worse). On October 29th, 2016, someone calling himself \u201cFatoldman\u201d posted that he had a \u201chot rumor\u201d about the FBI investigation.\n\u201c[T]he feds were forced to reopen the hillary email case [because] apparently the NYPD sex crimes unit was involved in the weiner case,\u201d Fatoldman wrote. \u201cOn his laptop they saw emails. [T]hey notified the FBI. Feds were afraid that NYPD would go public so they had to reopen or be accused of a coverup.\u201d\nSomeone posted the news to a law enforcement Facebook group. From there, a user called Eagle Wings (@NIVIsa4031) posted it to Twitter. Eagle Wings\u2019 profile picture shows a smiling middle-aged woman above the description \u201cUSAF Vet believes Freedom Soars.\u201d Among her more influential followers are former deputy assistant to President Trump Sebastian Gorka and former national security adviser Gen. Michael Flynn, who actually shared a separate Eagle- Wings tweet last year. Eagle Wings\u2019 enthusiastic following likely has something to do with membership in \u201cTrumps WarRoom,\u201d a private group of online activists who share and amplify political messages. Participants told Politico\u2019s Shawn Musgrave that hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of pro-Trump rooms coalesced during the campaign. \u201cThe members aren\u2019t stereotypical trolls,\u201d Musgrave tells me. \u201cMost are baby boomers.\u201d A lot are women from the Midwest.\nBut Eagle Wings is not a typical political enthusiast, says Woolley, who directs research at the Institute for the Future\u2019s Digital Intelligence Lab. She tweets too often (more than 50,000 times since November 2015) to too many followers (120,000 as of November 2017). \u201cWithout a shadow of a doubt,\u201d he says, \u201cEagle Wings is a highly automated account [and] part of a bot network\u201d \u2013 a centrally controlled group of social-media accounts. To explain how they work, Ben Nimmo, a fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab, uses a shepherding analogy. \u201cA message that someone or some organization wants to \u2018trend\u2019 is typically sent out by \u2018shepherd\u2019 accounts,\u201d he says, which often have large followings and are controlled by humans. The shepherds\u2019 messages are amplified by \u2018sheepdog\u2019 accounts, which are also run by humans but can be default-set \u201cto boost the signal and harass critics.\u201d At times, the shepherds personally steer conversations, but they also deploy automation, using a kind of Twitter cruise control to retweet particular keywords and hashtags. Together, Nimmo says, the shepherds and sheepdogs guide a herd of bots, which \u201cmindlessly repost content in the digital equivalent of sheep rushing in the same direction and bleating loudly.\u201d\nWhether Katz repeated something a herd of bots was bleating, or repackaged tidbits found on other parts of the Internet, her Facebook post was the \u201chuman touch\u201d that helped the fake news story go viral. The \u201ctell,\u201d says Watts, was what happened next. Most of us post into Internet oblivion. But about 12 hours after Katz shared her story, a Twitter user named @DavidGoldbergNY tweeted a screenshot of her post, twice \u2013 adding, \u201cI have been hearing the same thing from my NYPD buddies too. Next couple days will be -interesting!\u201d\nOn Twitter, @DavidGoldbergNY described himself as a \u201cJew, Lawyer & New Yorker.\u201d The account went live around the time of the Republican National Convention, in July 2016, posting divisive tweets like \u201cAttacking the 1 percent is attacking 43 percent of the Jewish community.\u201d The account\u2019s profile picture \u2013 a man with a nose Photoshopped to look very large and hooked \u2013 has been used online for more than a decade. Based on the limited threads that have been archived, Woolley says, @DavidGoldbergNY appears to have been, like Eagle Wings, \u201chighly automated\u201d and part of \u201can organized effort\u201d \u2013 possibly a bot network \u2013 to spread disinformation. One of @DavidGoldbergNY\u2019s tweets about the Katz Facebook post was retweeted 6,369 times.\nWhat\u2019s nearly impossible to tell is who ran @DavidGoldbergNY. The handle is not among the 2,752 Twitter accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, a disinformation shop run by the Kremlin, which the House Intelligence Committee released in November. And Twitter has yet to make public the handles of an additional 36,746 bot accounts its attorney Sean Edgett told Congress have \u201ccharacteristics we used to associate an account with Russia.\u201d In any case, Russia is not the only one playing this game. \u201cWe\u2019ve also had sources tell us that using bot networks has become a common practice among U.S. political campaigns,\u201d says Woolley, a practice that is difficult to trace. \u201cThey do it with subcontractors,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd the Federal Election Commission doesn\u2019t require reporting for subcontractors.\u201d One thing that does stand out, he adds, is \u201cthe more sophisticated bot nets, the ones that are successful at spreading stories, are built by people with a lot of resources. In our experience, across multiple different countries, the people that have deep pockets are the powerful political actors.\u201d\nAccording to a sample of tweets with Pizzagate or related hashtags provided by Filippo Menczer, a professor of informatics at Indiana University, Pizzagate was shared roughly 1.4 million times by more than a quarter of a million accounts in its first five weeks of life \u2013 from @DavidGoldbergNY\u2019s tweet to the day Welch showed up at Comet Ping Pong. The vast majority of tweeters in our sample, just 10 percent of all possible hits, posted about the story only a few times. But more than 3,000 accounts in our set tweeted about Pizzagate five times or more. Among these were dozens of users who tweet so frequently \u2013 up to 900 times a day \u2013 that experts believe they were likely highly automated. Even more striking: 22 percent of the tweets in our sample were later deleted by the user. This could be a sign, Woolley says, of \u201csomeone sweeping away everything so that we can\u2019t follow the trail.\u201d\nNext, we decided to cross-reference the most frequent Pizzagate tweeters with a list of 139 handles associated with Trump campaign staffers, advisers and surrogates. We also ran our entire sample against the list of accounts linked to Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency. We found that at least 14 Russia-linked accounts had tweeted about Pizzagate, including @Pamela_Moore13, whose avatar is, aptly, an anonymous figure wrapped in an American flag; that account has been retweeted by such prominent Trump supporters as Donald Trump Jr., Ann Coulter and Roger Stone, the political operative who recommended Paul Manafort as Trump\u2019s campaign manager. (Special Counsel Robert Mueller recently indicted Manafort for money laundering as part of his investigation into possible collusion with Russian efforts to influence the presidential race.) \u201cWell! Well! Well!\u201d \u201cPamela Moore\u201d tweeted on November 19th, 2016, above the fake news headline \u201cFBI: Rumors About Clinton Pedophile Ring Are True.\u201d\nThe campaign\u2019s engagement went far deeper. We found at least 66 Trump campaign figures who followed one or more of the most prolific Pizzagate tweeters. Michael Caputo, a Trump adviser who tweeted frequently about Clinton\u2019s e-mails, followed 146 of these accounts; Corey Stewart, Trump\u2019s campaign chair in Virginia, who lost a tight primary race for governor in June, followed 115; Paula White-Cain, Trump\u2019s spiritual adviser, followed 71; Pastor Darrell Scott, a prominent member of Trump\u2019s National Diversity Coalition, followed 33. Flynn\u2019s son, Michael Flynn Jr., who followed 58 of these accounts, famously took the bait and was ousted from the Trump transition team in early December after tweeting, \u201cUntil #Pizzagate proven to be false, it\u2019ll remain a story.\u201d\nMany of the Pizzagate tweeters had the characteristics of political bots \u2013 Twitter handles made up of random or semi-random letters and numbers and twin passions for conservative politics and pets (puppies and kitties win audience, Watts says). Others were all too human. Crystal Kemp, a 50-year-old grandmother who lives in Confluence, Pennsylvania, tweeted about the story more than 4,000 times in five weeks. I reached out to her via Facebook to ask why. \u201cDidn\u2019t want Hillary to win at any cost,\u201d Kemp tells me, \u201cbut liked Trump from day one. I don\u2019t really know that much about the Pizzagate thing. Everything I tweeted or retweeted was stuff that I found through my own research or from another follower.\u201d\nKemp tweeted links to articles from well-known right-wing sites like Fox News and Breitbart. But she also shared stories from obscure outlets like ConservativeDailyPost.com, which appears to be among the fake-news sites that operated from Macedonia during the election. Buzzfeed had found that teenagers in the deindustrialized town of Veles published pro-Trump stories because they were profitable as click-bait. When I traveled to Macedonia last summer, Borce Pejcev, a computer programmer who has set up dozens of fake-news sites \u2013 for around 100 euros each \u2013 said it wasn\u2019t quite that simple. Macedonians don\u2019t invent fake news stories, he told me. \u201cNo one here knows anything about American politics. They copy and paste from American sites, maybe try to come up with more dramatic headline.\u201d Fox News, TruePundit.com, DailyCaller.com, InfoWars and Breitbart, he said, were among the Macedonians\u2019 most common source material (\u201cBreit-bart was best\u201d). Macedonians would\u2019ve happily copied anti-Trump fake news too, he said. \u201cUnfortunately, there weren\u2019t any good U.S. pro-Clinton fake-news sites to copy and paste.\u201d\nThat was exactly how the right-wing-media ecosystem worked during the 2016 campaign, explains Yochai Benkler, who directs the Berkman-Klein Center for the Internet and Society at Harvard. After the election, he and his colleagues mapped about 2 million campaign-news stories. He found that far-right-media outlets were organized extremely tightly around Breitbart and, to a lesser degree, FoxNews.com. \u201cThe right paid attention to right-wing sites, and the more right-wing they were, the more attention they got,\u201d Benkler says. More extreme sites would distort and exaggerate the claims, but they would use a \u201crelatively- credible source\u201d such as Breitbart as a validator. \u201cBecause they were repeated not only on the very far-fringe sites but also by sites that are at the center of this cluster, the right-wing disinformation circulated and amplified very quickly.\u201d\nDouglas Hagmann is a self-employed private investigator and host of HagmannReport.com, a webcast that exposes the \u201cNew World Order agenda.\u201d It was Hagmann who \u2013 four days after Carmen Katz first posted the story and six days before Election Day \u2013 brought Pizzagate from social media to fake news\u2019 largest stage. On the November 2nd broadcast of InfoWars, arguably the most influential conspiracy-theory outlet in the country, with 7.7 million unique visitors to its website a month, Alex Jones asked Hagmann to tell his audience what sources had revealed about the e-mails recovered on Weiner\u2019s computer. \u201c[T]he most disgusting aspect of this is the sexual angle,\u201d Hagmann said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be graphic or gross here. . . . Based on my source, Hillary did in fact participate on some of the junkets on the Lolita Express.\u201d\nThe story took off. Google Trends measures interest in topics among the 1.17 billion users of its search engine on a 0-100 scale. On October 29th, the day Katz posted the story on Facebook, searches for \u201cHillary\u201d and \u201cpedophile\u201d ranked zero. Ninety-six hours later, when Hagmann \u201cbroke\u201d the story on InfoWars, they scored 100.\nIn April, Hagmann agreed to meet with me for a look at his \u201ccourtroom-ready\u201d documents on Pizzagate. His split-level home in Erie, Pennsylvania, is on a quiet leafy street. In the front yard, there\u2019s a small waterfall, a rock garden and a large sign warning that the place is under surveillance. He greeted me in the foyer wearing a suit and tie, his hair slicked back with Brylcreem, and led the way downstairs to his basement broadcast center.\nIn October 2016, Hagmann claimed, he \u201ccommunicated\u201d with a friend who knows someone affiliated with the NYPD. The friend of the friend had been on the \u201ctask force\u201d that secured Weiner\u2019s computer and had copied documents onto a thumb drive \u201cproving\u201d Clinton and her associates were involved in pedophilia. \u201cNow, I can\u2019t get him to give me the thumb drive,\u201d he said. \u201cOr even admit to the fact that he had it.\u201d When I asked how he knew the files existed, he said, \u201cI trust my source.\u201d\nHagmann then launched into a synopsis of three decades of rumors that Clinton and her associates are lesbians and perverts. He started with the claims of Cathy O\u2019Brien, a conspiracy theorist from Muskegon, Michigan, who alleged that while held as a CIA sex slave, she was forced to service Hillary Clinton. Hagmann moved on to Clinton\u2019s \u201cclose\u201d relationship with Weiner\u2019s estranged wife, and the allegation that her campaign manager, John Podesta, and his brother Tony resemble sketches of the suspects in the 2007 disappearance of four-year-old Madeleine McCann in Portugal. \u201cSorry,\u201d Hagmann stopped himself. \u201cI know this case is difficult. Circumstantial.\u201d\nWhen I asked if he had verified anything, Hagmann shuffled some papers, lifting one sheet by a corner, like a poker player. With apparent reluctance, he turned over a color copy of an image showing a clean, uninjured boy wearing a green T-shirt in a dog cage. The child could have been playing or held hostage. \u201cThat might be a disturbing image,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see what it has to do with Hillary Clinton.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou could say I have dog crap for answers and dog crap for sources,\u201d he said, adding later, \u201cI hope you don\u2019t think this was a waste.\u201d\nThe following month, at Awaken to the Shakin\u2019, a Bible conference in Gurnee, Illinois, Hagmann presented his evidence to an audience of about 40 middle-aged churchgoers. His courtroom-ready exhibits included the Wikipedia entry for \u201cfake news,\u201d the New Oxford Dictionary definition of \u201cpost-truth,\u201d a quote by John Wayne, a photo of people sitting on a couch wearing horse masks, a photo of scars on the fingers of John Podesta. And the kicker \u2013 a photo of a decapitated body that Hagmann said was a victim of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer and another of a sculpture by Louise Bourgeois in Tony Podesta\u2019s home, ironically titled \u201cThe Arch of Hysteria.\u201d The two images, he said, are shockingly similar.\nAll the same, two days after Hagmann\u2019s appearance on InfoWars, Erik Prince, the brother of Trump\u2019s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, \u201cconfirmed\u201d that the terrible rumor was true in an interview on Breitbart. Prince is best known as the founder of the private military company Blackwater USA, whose mercenaries shot and killed 17 unarmed Iraqi civilians in Baghdad\u2019s Nisour Square in 2007. He donated $250,000 to the Trump campaign and became an informal adviser on intelligence and security issues, traveling to the Seychelles during the transition to meet with a Kremlin associate in an attempt to create back-channel communications between Moscow and the president-elect. On Breitbart radio, Prince painted a picture sure to stir the far right. \u201cBecause of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating,\u201d he said. \u201cThey found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money-laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times.\u201d\nThe right-wing-media system went into overdrive. Prince\u2019s story was picked up and embellished by other right-wing outlets, and made its way back to InfoWars that afternoon. Citing Prince\u2019s interview, Jones fumed, \u201cWhen I think about all the children Hillary Clinton has personally murdered and chopped up and raped . . . yeah, you heard me right. Hillary Clinton has personally murdered children.\u201d Jones\u2019 video was viewed on YouTube more than 427,000 times. Prince\u2019s interview was shared another 81,000 times. On Twitter, the numbers were increasing exponentially- \u2013 300 percent in just six days.\nLong before October 28th, 2016, when Comey wrote to Congress that the FBI would be reexamining Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server, her campaign knew they had a huge e-mail problem. In focus groups, voters conflated the case with the e-mails Russian operatives had hacked from the Democratic National Committee and Podesta, her campaign manager. Though U.S. intelligence agencies now agree that a Kremlin\u2013associated group, Fancy Bear, hacked the e-mails \u2013 which WikiLeaks began posting less than an hour after The Washington Post published Trump\u2019s \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d video \u2013 a senior Clinton campaign staffer tells me, \u201cThere was just more voyeuristic interest in the content of the e-mails than in how they were obtained.\u201d\nThe confusion was encouraged online by the likes of @DavidGoldbergNY. The e-mails on Weiner\u2019s laptop had nothing to do with Podesta\u2019s Gmail account, but one of his tweets of the Katz post included #podestaemails23. \u201cThat hashtag is a flag,\u201d Woolley says. \u201cIt suggests that @DavidGoldbergNY is attempting to get people to look at something.\u201d On message boards, amateur sleuths searched for encoded evidence in the Podesta e-mails. A particular source of fascination was an invitation from the performance artist Marina Abramovic for Podesta to attend a \u201cSpirit Cooking dinner.\u201d Allegations started circulating that Clinton consumed semen, breast milk and menstrual blood.\nThe story still hadn\u2019t penetrated Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters. They\u2019d become inured to the avalanche of fake news \u2013 the rumors that she was on her deathbed, funding ISIS, even dissed by the pope. But when a Clinton campaign staffer noticed \u201cPodesta Spirit Cooking Emails Reveal Clinton\u2019s Inner Circle as Sex Cult with Connections to Human Trafficking\u201d on DangerandPlay.com become \u201cPodesta Practices Occult Magic\u201d on the Drudge Report, and then saw Alex Jones shouting that Clinton \u201cis an abject, psychopathic demon from hell,\u201d who \u201csmell[s] like sulfur,\u201d he went straight into Podesta\u2019s office at the campaign\u2019s Brooklyn headquarters. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe it,\u201d the aide told him. \u201cNow you\u2019re a fucking witch.\u201d\nIt got even weirder after users on 8chan read a Podesta e-mail that revealed that Democratic activist David Brock had dated the owner of Comet Ping Pong pizzeria, James Alefantis. The citizen investigators considered Brock their archenemy \u2013 he\u2019d founded Correct the Record, a Super PAC that defended Clinton against defamation by online trolls. Suddenly, they saw sinister meaning in any mention of pizza; for instance, the first letters in the words \u201ccheese pizza\u201d are the same as in \u201cchild porn.\u201d\nUntil November 2016, the Pizzagate hashtag had mostly referred to Trump\u2019s use of a fork and knife to eat pizza. But on November 4th, two days after Hagmann\u2019s appearance on InfoWars, Cassandra Fairbanks, then a reporter for Sputnik News (which U.S. intelligence says spreads Kremlin-directed- disinformation), tweeted, \u201cI\u2019ve literally spent the last hour wondering if podesta ingested sperm mixed with breast milk with his brother.\u201d In response, another user, @GodlessNZ, appears to have launched the hashtag: \u201cTweets assembling under #JohnMolesta and maybe #PizzaGate.\u201d\nThat day, Alefantis got a phone call from a reporter at The Washington City Paper seeking a comment about a rumor going viral on Reddit. \u201cWhat\u2019s Reddit?\u201d Alefantis asked.\nIt was just beginning. Even as the election came and went, several Twitter accounts tweeted exclusively about Pizzagate to a number of alt-right \u201cinfluencers\u201d \u2013 among them InfoWars and Brittany Pettibone, one of a handful of alt-right \u201cgirls\u201d who regularly appear at the movement\u2019s events. At least one single-minded account, @Pizza_Gate, likely caught the attention of Mehmet Ali \u00d6nel, a Turkish TV anchor. The network \u00d6nel works for is linked to the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdoan, which was facing international condemnation (including from the Obama State Department) for proposing a law that would risk decriminalizing pedophilia for offenders who married their victims. \u00d6nel, who has 196,000 Twitter followers, was one of dozens of Turkish commentators who claimed Americans had no right calling out Turkey for sex crimes with Pizzagate erupting in their own capital. One of the most shared Pizzagate tweets was posted by the anchor on November 16th. Roughly translated, it reads, \u201cUSA #PizzaGate shaken by the pedophilia scandals.\u201d\nAmong the users who picked up the thread was Jack Posobiec, a well-known alt-right troll whom Trump himself has retweeted. During the campaign, Posobiec was special-projects director for Citizens for Trump, a never-officially-organized voter-fraud prevention group. Several hours after \u00d6nel sent his November 16th tweet, Posobiec went to investigate Comet Ping Pong and another nearby pizzeria. Live-streaming the visit on Periscope, he described evidence of \u201cwhat\u2019s really going on\u201d \u2013 a double pane of glass near an oven, security cameras, a texting cashier. Posobiec paused, worrying his viewers might not understand the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s like in the movie Jurassic Park,\u201d he said. \u201cNedry had the shaving cream bottle. And you could press the top and a little bit of shaving cream came out. . . . The bottom part is where they had the dinosaur embryos.\u201d\nThe Twittersphere went wild. The previous day, our sample indicates there were roughly 6,000 tweets about Pizzagate. Now, it was closer to 55,000. Alefantis tried and failed to get Facebook and Twitter to remove the posts. (Both companies declined to comment for this story.) When the restaurant started getting death threats, Alefantis called the police, then the FBI, and got nowhere. \u201cIt turns out you can say anything about anyone online,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s your First Amendment right to terrorize.\u201d\nAlefantis thought he\u2019d finally scored a victory when The New York Times published an article debunking Pizzagate. He learned what the Clinton campaign found out too late. As Harvard\u2019s Benkler puts it, \u201cThe right-wing-media ecosystem had become so hyperpartisan, so self-referential and so superinsular it often simply ignored information that\u2019s disconfirming.\u201d Instead, right-wing social media referenced mainstream coverage as a way to \u201clegitimate\u201d their claims. On November 21st, the day the Times published its story, our sample shows Twitter traffic about Pizzagate hit unprecedented levels: some 120,000 tweets.\nTrolls on message boards began posting whole \u201cdossiers\u201d of private information about Comet Ping Pong employees and top Democrats, down to the movies that Podesta ordered on Netflix. On November 22nd, when Reddit banned a Pizzagate subreddit for posting obviously stolen private information, a moderator responded, \u201cWe have all made life insurance videos. We have all vowed to continue this fight. You have only increased our number. This morning we were numerous, tonight we are legion.\u201d About 145,000 tweets flew that day.\nThe next day, InfoWars posted a video called \u201cPizzagate Is Real.\u201d On November 27th, Jones spent a half-hour explaining the story. \u201cSomething\u2019s being covered up,\u201d he told his audience. \u201cAll I know is, God help us, we\u2019re in the hands of pure evil.\u201d Hours later, he released another video, \u201cDown the #Pizzagate Rabbit Hole.\u201d On December 1st, the show posted \u201cPizzagate: The Bigger Picture.\u201d In North Carolina, Edgar Maddison Welch was obsessively watching much of this coverage. By the evening of December 4th, he was in solitary confinement in a Washington, D.C., jail.\nNearly a year after the election, in three separate hearings with members of Congress, executives from Twitter, Facebook and Google took turns expressing contrition for hosting Russia\u2019s attempts to manipulate U.S. public opinion. A Facebook vice president said it \u201cpains us as a company\u201d that foreign actors \u201cabused our platform.\u201d Twitter\u2019s general counsel said he too was \u201ctroubled\u201d that the power of Twitter was misused.\n\u201cThere was this concept of \u2018Social media is going to save democracy,\u2019 \u201d Woolley tells me. \u201cTwitter didn\u2019t envision that powerful political actors were going to use social media in attempts to spread propaganda.\u201d Among the many strange aspects of Pizzagate was the fact that the story went viral after the election. All of the Russia-linked tweets we found were sent after November 8th. Bot networks appear to be tweeting out the hashtag to this day. Woolley suggests it could be an attempt to \u201cbolster\u201d Trump\u2019s position, to \u201cwin over people\u2019s hearts and minds.\u201d Clinton had lost the presidency, he says, but \u201cshe was not done in terms of her ability to be a representative of democratic ideals, or of the ideals that were oppositional to Donald Trump.\u201d\nWatts, the cyber-security expert, doesn\u2019t know if Russia and the Trump campaign colluded on Pizzagate, or anything else. But both camps were clearly opportunistic. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that there was no indigenous support,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Russians don\u2019t create this whole [alt-right] movement. They just harness it.\u201d Of course, so did Trump. But Watts believes the Russians, at least, are playing for much higher stakes than one presidential election. \u201cThe goal is to create division between communities,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is making you not trust the state. It\u2019s eroding the mandate of elected officials so that they can\u2019t govern properly. It\u2019s making people want to not participate in democracy because they think it\u2019s corrupt. It\u2019s getting you to either believe that it\u2019s all stacked against you or you just opt out altogether because you don\u2019t know what to believe. When you don\u2019t know what to believe, you\u2019ll believe anything.\u201d\nTo learn more about how #Pizzagate spread, tune in to Reveal, distributed by PRX.
