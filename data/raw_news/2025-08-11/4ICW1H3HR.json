  "title": "Bolivia's election may spell the end of its long-ruling left. Here's what to know",
  "description": "Bolivia\u2019s governing Movement Toward Socialism party won\u2019t have a big-name presidential candidate on the ballot for the first time in two decades",
  "content": "But when Aliaga goes to the polls on Sunday to vote for Bolivia\u2019s next president, he won\u2019t see Morales' name on the ballot after electoral authorities excluded him.\n\nIn fact, for the first time in two decades, Aliaga won\u2019t see any big name from the governing Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party that Morales founded \u2014 not even President Luis Arce , Morales\u2019 protege-turned-rival, who withdrew from the race over his failure to halt an economic tailspin .\n\n\u201cThe right wing had its chance, and it was a disaster,\u201d he said, recalling the hardship of the 1990s, when Bolivia became a poster child for free-market economics and the two right-wing front-runners \u2014 businessman Samuel Doria Medina and ex-President Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga \u2014 built their careers.\n\n\u201cBut the left wing has proven to be the same, or worse,\u201d Aliaga said, referring to how the MAS strategy of nationalizing resources and redistributing tax receipts sputtered out with the end of the commodities boom.\n\nTensions within MAS can be traced to Morales\u2019 disputed 2019 reelection . Protests erupted and the leftist leader resigned under pressure from the military. He fled into exile and right-wing Senator Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez took office in what many view as a coup.\n\nBut their competing ambitions collided when Morales announced his intention to return to politics. Lawmakers loyal to Morales deprived Arce\u2019s government of its majority. Judges answering to Arce ordered Morales\u2019 arrest over his sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl and barred his 2025 presidential candidacy on account of his past terms.\n\nEver since, Quiroga has yearned for a term of his own. He ran three times \u2014 twice against Morales in 2005 and 2014. Now 65, he\u2019s hoping the fourth time\u2019s the charm.\n\nNow once-routine errands have turned into nightmares as Bolivians wait in fuel lines that wrap around city blocks, run from pharmacy to pharmacy in search of medicines and queue for subsidized bread that has shrunk to almost half its normal size.\n\n\u201cNull votes signal that these elections are not legitimate and the next government of Bolivia won\u2019t be legitimate,\u201d said Chris Velasco, an organizer close to Morales. \u201cThat will mean political instability, social instability.\u201d",

      "text": "Bolivia boosts lithium resources estimate, cementing spot as global leader\nLA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) \u2014 The total of Bolivia\u2019s confirmed lithium resources has increased 2 million tons to 23 million tons, the Andean country\u2019s president said Thursday.\nThe new estimate further cements Bolivia\u2019s position as the country with the world\u2019s biggest known deposits of lithium, which is in high demand for use in batteries.\n\u201cWe are the largest lithium reserve in the world, and we have to know how to manage it intelligently to exploit and transform this resource,\u201d President Luis Arce said at the Coipasa salt flat, around 280 kilometers (175 miles) south of the capital of La Paz.\nBolivia has stepped up its search for international partners to help develop its lithium reserves at a time when demand for the metal is soaring amid the transition to renewable energy around the world and the growth in electric vehicles powered by lithium batteries.\nThe increase in the estimate of Bolivia\u2019s reserves came after further geological studies in the Coipasa and Pasto Grandes salt flats, Raul Mayta, vice minister of exploration and exploitation of energy resources, told the state television channel, Bolivia TV.\nArce is pushing to boost Bolivia\u2019s role in the international lithium market after 14 years of little progress that left it lagging behind neighboring Chile and Argentina. The three countries are home to an area that contains a large share of the world\u2019s proven reserves of lithium.\nLast month, Arce\u2019s government signed an agreement with China\u2019s Citic Guoan and Russia\u2019s Uranium One Group to exploit Bolivia\u2019s lithium deposits. Together, they promised to invest $1.4 billion for the construction of two plants for the production and export of 50,000 tons of lithium annually starting in 2025 in the Pastos Grandes salt flats.\nA similar amount of investment was reported when the government signed an agreement in January with Contemporary Amperex Technology of China.\nArgentina has the world\u2019s second-largest lithium reserves, at 20 million tons, followed by the United States with 12 million tons and Chile with 11 million tons, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The world\u2019s top lithium producer is Australia, followed by Chile and China in third place, according to the U.S. agency."

      "text": "In Bolivia\u2019s scrappy highlands, proud Indigenous Cholas take the runway by storm\nIn Bolivia\u2019s scrappy highlands, proud Indigenous Cholas take the runway by storm\nVIACHA, Bolivia (AP) \u2014 In the huddled markets, sprawling farms and pulsing parties of Viacha, a town southeast of Bolivia\u2019s capital, it\u2019s typical for women to sport bowler hats, tiered skirts and fringed shawls.\nWhat\u2019s less typical is for the fashion spotlight to turn to these outfits \u2014 worn by \u201cCholas,\u201d Indigenous women from the highland Altiplano.\nBut late Friday in Viacha, some 22 kilometers (13 miles) from Bolivia\u2019s capital of La Paz \u2014 over 12,000 feet (3,650 meters) above sea level \u2014 awe-struck teenage boys and proud mothers throbbed the main square as the town\u2019s dirt roadway was briefly transformed into a runway.\nOne by one, the girls from Viacha \u2014 mostly students between 15-25 years old \u2014 strutted down the catwalk to a surprising soundtrack of early 2000s American pop music. Street vendors hawked hot dogs and empanadas. Supporters cheered in Spanish and the Indigenous Aymaran language.\nWearing glittering shoes and brightly colored, bunched-out skirts called \u201cpolleras,\u201d the amateur models of all heights and sizes twirled, tipped their hats and threw sultry glances at the crowd.\n\u201cYears ago, people would associate these skirts with the fields, they\u2019d look down on us as rural peasants,\u201d said Rogelia Canaviri, 42, who couldn\u2019t stop smiling as she watched her daughter, Carolina, stride down the runway in dangling pearl earrings, the sequins on her layer-cake red skirt catching the stage lights.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m proud of, to see my daughter and her friends enjoy what I\u2019ve worn for work my whole life,\u201d she said, pointing to the wool shawl, velvet hat and lower-key beige pollera she had on \u2014 the same clothes, she said, she still wears to milk her cows and sell her cheese at open-air markets. Her own mother did the same.\nGenerations ago, the Aymara were subject to waves of conquest and dispossession, first by the Inca, then by the Spanish, who forced the Indigenous communities to abandon their traditional way of dressing and adopt the style then-popular in the court of Seville.\nLegend has it that the jaunty felt bowler hat became critical to the get-up after being introduced by British railway workers in the 1920s.\nBolivia\u2019s whiter, more affluent population has used \u201cChola\u201d \u2014 and its diminutive, \u201cCholita\u201d \u2014 as dismissive racial epithets. But in recent decades that stigma has dissipated, with Indigenous Aymara proudly reclaiming the word and younger Bolivians rediscovering the charm of their mothers\u2019 and grandmothers\u2019 vibrant garments.\n\u201cI think the \u2018Cholita\u2019 has become something very interesting, very exciting in our current context,\u201d said Brittany Cantuta Valeria, 21, a first-time model, her hat brimmed upward and cheeks flushed a reddish gold.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now at the point of being respected because of everything that\u2019s been implemented, so I wear this to have fun, to show off, to go to parties and dances. I have nothing to do with working the fields.\u201d\nMost of the girls parading onstage Friday, in the show organized by the Viacha municipality, grew up during the tenure of former leftist President Evo Morales (2006-2019), the country\u2019s first-ever Indigenous president whose championing of Bolivia\u2019s Indigenous majority earned him fervent support across the cinderblock and adobe homes of the Altiplano.\nMorales instituted a new constitution, which, among other things, expanded recognition for Bolivia\u2019s 36 ethnic groups. He promoted the teaching of Indigenous languages and boosted state funding for folkloric arts. More Chola runway shows and beauty contests cropped up, widening the reach of Bolivia\u2019s native highland culture.\nBut fashion fanfare was largely limited to La Paz, the seat of the government. Before Friday, the town of Viacha, like most of the other villages across these austere mountain-rimmed plains, had never taken its turn on the runway.\n\u201cI was really nervous but I realized this is the first time for all of us,\u201d said 15-year-old Tomasa Ramirez. \u201cI feel so pretty. Now I know it\u2019s my dream to be a Cholita model.\u201d\nWith Bolivia\u2019s economic crisis closing like a vise on families whose money has diminished in value while the cost of food has doubled, many girls said walking the show was no easy feat.\nTop-notch velvet hats and shawls made from vicu\u00f1a wool with silk fringes can fetch thousands of dollars. Polleras cost a few hundred dollars. Then there\u2019s the jewelry \u2014 ideally made of real gold, pearls and diamonds when worn to these kinds of formal events.\n\u201cThis year there was no way I could have real ones,\u201d said Julieta Mamani, 16, pointing to her gold-colored earrings. \u201cI hope things will be different next year.\u201d\nWatching her 24-year-old daughter pose for selfies in her elaborate skirt, Canaviri, the dairy farmer, has another hope.\n\u201cI hope she doesn\u2019t like wearing pants,\u201d she said of her daughter. \u201cI tried on pants once in my life, and I felt naked. Never again.\u201d"

Some of the queues don\u2019t budge for days.\nWhile frustration builds, drivers like Victor Garc\u00eda now eat, sleep and socialize around their stationary trucks, waiting to buy just a few gallons of diesel \u2014 unless the station runs dry.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but we\u2019re going to be worse off,\u201d said Garc\u00eda, 66, who inched closer to the pump Tuesday as the hours ticked by in El Alto, a bare-bones sprawl beside Bolivia\u2019s capital in the Andean altiplano.\nBolivia\u2019s monthslong fuel crunch comes as the nation\u2019s foreign currency reserves plummet, leaving Bolivians unable to find U.S. dollars at banks and exchange houses. Imported goods that were once commonplace have become scarce.\nThe fuel crisis has created a sense that the country is coming undone, disrupting economic activity and everyday life for millions of people, hurting commerce and farm production and sending food prices soaring.\nMounting public anger has driven crowds into the streets in recent weeks, piling pressure on leftist President Luis Arce to ease the suffering ahead of a tense election next year.\n\u201cWe want effective solutions to the shortage of fuel, dollars and the increase in food prices,\u201d said Reinerio Vargas, the vice rector of Gabriel Ren\u00e9 Moreno Autonomous University in the eastern province of Santa Cruz, where hundreds of desperate truckers and residents flooded main squares Tuesday to vent their anger at Arce\u2019s inaction and demand early elections.\nIn a similar eruption of discontent, protesters shouting \u201cEverything is expensive!\u201d marched through the streets of the capital, La Paz, last week.\nBolivians say Arce\u2019s image has suffered not only because of the crisis but also because his government insists that it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\u201cDiesel sales are in the process of returning to normal,\u201d Economy Minister Marcelo Montenegro said Tuesday.\nArce has repeatedly vowed that his government will end the fuel shortages and lower the prices of basic goods by arbitrary deadlines. On Nov. 10, he again promised he would \u201cresolve this issue\u201d in 10 days.\nAs the deadlines come and go, the black market currency exchange rate has risen to nearly 40% more than the official rate.\nArce\u2019s office did not respond to interview requests.\n\u201cThe queues are getting longer and longer,\u201d said 38-year-old driver Ramiro Morales, who needed a bathroom after four hours in line Tuesday but feared losing his place if he went searching for one. \u201cPeople are exhausted.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a shocking turnaround for the landlocked nation of 12 million people that was a South American economic success story in the 2000s, when the commodities bonanza generated tens of billions of dollars under the nation\u2019s first Indigenous president, former President Evo Morales.\nMorales, Arce\u2019s one-time mentor, is his present-day rival in the fight to be the ruling party\u2019s candidate next year.\nBut when the commodities boom ended, prices slumped and gas production dwindled. Now, Bolivia spends an estimated $56 million a week to import most of its gasoline and diesel from Argentina, Paraguay and Russia.\nEconomy Minister Montenegro on Tuesday pledged that the government would continue providing fuel subsidies that critics say it can\u2019t afford.\nBanners from two years ago boasting that Bolivia\u2019s inflation is the lowest in South America still greet tourists arriving at El Alto International Airport. Now, inflation is among the highest in the region.\nFuel shortages prevent farmers from getting their produce to distribution centers and markets, triggering a sharp price hike for food staples.\nLast week in La Paz and neighboring El Alto, hungry Bolivians jostled in long lines to buy rice after much-delayed shipments finally arrived from Santa Cruz, the country\u2019s economic engine some 850 kilometers (528 miles) away.\nWith the diesel shortage affecting everything from the operation of tractors to the sourcing of machinery parts, the shortage is also hurting farmers during the crucial planting season.\n\u201cWithout diesel, there is no food for 2025,\u201d said Klaus Frerking, the vice president of the Eastern Agricultural Chamber of Bolivia.\nThe prices of potatoes, onions and milk have doubled in El Alto\u2019s main wholesale food market in the past month, vendors said, overshooting the country\u2019s nearly 8% inflation rate.\nNervous Bolivians are cutting back on their consumption.\n\u201cYou have to search a lot to find the cheapest food,\u201d said 67-year-old Angela Mamani, struggling to pull together meals for her six grandchildren at El Alto\u2019s open-air market Tuesday. She planned to buy vegetables but didn\u2019t have enough cash and went home empty-handed.\nThis week, Arce\u2019s government presented a 2025 budget \u2014 with a 12% increase in spending \u2014 that drew backlash from lawmakers and business leaders who said it would lead to more debt and more inflation.\nWhile the governing Movement Toward Socialism party tears itself apart in the power struggle between Arce and Morales, both politicians have seen the economic morass as a way to strengthen their positions ahead of 2025 elections.\n\u201cThey deny there are problems. They blame external contexts and conflicts,\u201d said Bolivian economic analyst Gonzalo Ch\u00e1vez.\nMorales\u2019 supporters last month launched 24-day protest partly targeting Arce\u2019s handling of the economy that blocked main roads and stranded commercial shipments, costing the government billions of dollars.\nSecurity forces broke up the rallies almost a month ago. But on Tuesday, Arce\u2019s government continued to blame Morales\u2019 blockades for spawning the ubiquitous fuel lines.\n\u201cWe need change,\u201d said Geanina Garc\u00eda, a 31-year-old architect scouring the grocery hub of El Alto for cheap deals \u2014 a once-routine errand that she said had turned into a nightmare.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t live off politics, they live day to day, off of what they produce and what they earn.\u201d\n____\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america"

That\u2019s why we\u2019re in the streets.\u201d\nBolivia\u2019s financial quagmire stems, at least in part, from an unprecedented rift at the highest levels of the governing party.\nPresident Luis Arce and his one-time ally, leftist icon and former President Evo Morales, are battling for the future of Bolivia\u2019s splintering Movement for Socialism, known by its Spanish acronym MAS, ahead of elections in 2025.\nThe political fight has paralyzed the government\u2019s efforts to deal with the deepening economic despair and analysts warn that the social unrest could explode in the historically turbulent nation of 12 million people.\nCracks in the governing party opened in 2019, when Morales, then Bolivia\u2019s first Indigenous president, ran for an unconstitutional third term. He won a contested vote plagued by allegations of fraud, setting off mass protests that caused 36 deaths and prompted Morales to resign and flee the country.\nAfter an interim government took control in what MAS called a coup, Morales\u2019 chosen successor, Arce, won election on a campaign promise to restore prosperity to Bolivia, once Latin America\u2019s mainstay source of natural gas.\nArce had been Morales\u2019 finance minister who oversaw years of strong growth and low inflation, but assuming the presidency in 2020, he encountered a bleak economic reckoning from the coronavirus pandemic. Diminished gas production sealed the end of Bolivia\u2019s budget-busting economic model.\nStill hugely popular among Bolivia\u2019s Indigenous communities, coca growers and union workers, Morales saw an opportunity. After returning from exile, the charismatic populist announced plans last year to run in the 2025 vote \u2014 setting himself on a collision course with Arce, who is expected to seek re-election.\n\u201cBolivia has an Indigenous majority and people will instinctively support someone like Morales based on what he represents,\u201d said Diego von Vacano, an expert in Bolivian politics at Texas A&M University and former informal adviser to Arce. \u201cNow they have the push factor, the lack of success of the Arce administration.\u201d\nEarlier this month, Morales drew tens of thousands of loyalists to Cochabamba southeast of La Paz, galvanizing his rural stronghold.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to win the elections and we\u2019re going to save Bolivia,\u201d a triumphant Morales bellowed in a stadium filled with cheering supporters waving wiphalas, the checkerboards of bright colors to represent Bolivia\u2019s many peoples.\nArce disputes the legitimacy of Morales\u2019 campaign, arguing a 2023 constitutional court ruling bars him from running.\nLegal experts say it\u2019s not so clear-cut.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen both the politicians manipulate the courts to decide political issues that have major bearing on the constitution,\u201d said Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez Veltz\u00e9, a Bolivian judge who served as president in 2005-2006.\nMorales, who proclaimed in his speech that \u201cwe have complied with the rules,\u201d has threatened to unleash mass unrest if he is disqualified from running.\nMeanwhile, with the cash crunch denying access to dollars to pay suppliers abroad, Bolivian merchants have produced extraordinary scenes on the border with Brazil and Peru by clamoring to buy the U.S. currency at inflated prices in the neighboring countries.\nWhen exchange shops in La Paz ran dry last year, Bolivians waited in line all night outside the Central Bank to get hard currency.\nIt\u2019s a striking contrast to Bolivia\u2019s boom at the turn of the 21st century. Buoyed by a windfall of export revenue, Morales\u2019 government pulled the poverty rate down to 15%, expanded the middle class and built up sprawling cities and roads.\nTrouble began in 2014 when commodity prices plunged and the government dipped into its currency reserves to sustain spending. Then it drew on its gold reserves and even sold its dollar bonds locally.\n\u201cWe ate up the savings and now we are scraping the pot,\u201d said Gonzalo Ch\u00e1vez, economics professor at Bolivia\u2019s Catholic University.\nWith the government forking out $2 billion a year to import heavily subsidized gasoline in an effort to quell public discontent, the squeeze has tightened. The Fitch rating agency in February downgraded Bolivia\u2019s debt deeper into junk territory, assigning it a CCC rating.\nAnd the fight over MAS is exacerbating economic woes.\nMorales\u2019 allies in Bolivia\u2019s Congress have consistently thwarted Arce\u2019s attempts to take on debt that would relieve the pressure. Bolivia sits on a treasure trove of lithium, but lawmakers won\u2019t give Arce approval to let foreign companies extract it.\nArce calls the gridlock an \u201ceconomic boycott\u201d aimed at subverting his presidency.\nSeeking to ease investor fears, Finance Minister Marcelo Montenegro denies there is any crisis. But the long lines of frustrated motorists outside gas stations suggest otherwise. In recent days, angry truckers have blocked roads and burned tires.\n\u201cArce has dismantled our social organizations while abandoning his management of the economy,\u201d said Jorge Cucho, an Indigenous leader and activist. \u201cPrices have increased by 70%. Our salaries are no longer enough to go to the market.\u201d\nThe tensions tearing at MAS offer Bolivia\u2019s opposition its first real shot at power since Morales won an unprecedented electoral majority in 2005. Centrist and conservative politicians have jumped into the field. But the opposition is fractured and its legitimacy is in question, with dozens of its politicians behind bars.\n\u201cThe opposition has far more opportunities now due to the division,\u201d said Fernando Mayorga, a sociologist at Bolivia\u2019s public university in Cochabamba. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve seen no signs that it can act on them.\u201d\nBolivians who are incensed by Morales but disappointed by Arce say the country stands at a perilous crossroads.\n\u201cThe people are asleep,\u201d said Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, the union leader. \u201cSoon they\u2019ll begin to rise up.\u201d\n___\nDeBre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina."

Speaking to officials from China and Latin America on Tuesday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping reiterated Beijing\u2019s stance that nobody wins a trade war and that \u201cbullying or hegemonism only leads to self-isolation.\u201d\nHaving moved to defuse antagonisms with the U.S., Xi said China stands ready to \u201cjoin hands\u201d with Latin countries \u201cin the face of seething undercurrents of pure political and bloc confrontation and the surging tide of unilateralism and protectionism.\u201d\n\u201cThere are no winners in tariff wars or trade wars,\u201d Xi said, reiterating a phrase China has used repeatedly when referring to Trump\u2019s policies.\nWhen Trump began raising tariffs on Chinese products during his first term in office, China retaliated by diversifying its purchases of key farm products, such as soybeans and beef, away from U.S. suppliers. Brazil and other Latin American countries have benefited from that strategy.\nAlso Tuesday, the head of the World Trade Organization appealed to Japan to fight disruptions to world commerce from Trump\u2019s fast-changing tariffs and other policies.\n\u201cTrade is facing very challenging times right now and it is quite difficult,\u201d Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director-general of the Geneva-based WTO, told Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba while on a visit to Tokyo.\nJapan, as \u201ca champion of the multilateral trading system\u201d must help maintain, strengthen and reform the WTO, the Japanese Foreign Ministry cited her as saying.\nJapan is among many countries yet to reach a deal with the Trump administration on hikes to U.S. tariffs, including those on autos, steel and aluminum.\nThe WTO played a pivotal role in past decades as the U.S. and other major economies crusaded for the more open markets that facilitated the growth of global supply chains, many of which are anchored in China.\nBy dismantling many protectionist barriers to trade, it has aided the ascent of Japan and China, and many other countries, as export manufacturing hubs.\nSince taking office for a second time, Trump has prioritized higher tariffs to try to reduce U.S. imports and compel companies to locate factories in the United States, doubling down on a trade war that he launched during his first term.\nThe realities of Trump\u2019s global trade offensive overshadowed an initial burst of optimism over the China-U.S. deal among investors, as rallies in stocks and oil prices faded on Tuesday.\nSpeaking to the China-CELAC, or Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, Forum, Xi, the Chinese leader, announced plans to build closer ties with Latin America through political, economic, academic and security exchanges.\nHe promised to boost imports from the region, to encourage Chinese companies to increase their investments, and said Beijing plans to expand cooperation in clean energy, 5G telecommunications and artificial intelligence. He also announced a new 66 billion yuan ($9.2 billion) credit line to support Latin American and Caribbean financing.\nChina\u2019s trade with the region has been growing rapidly, exceeding $500 billion for the first time last year, as it imported more farm products such as soybeans and beef, energy resources such as crude oil, iron ore, and critical minerals.\nBeijing\u2019s investments in the region through Xi\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, have included installing 5G networks and building ports and hydropower plants.\nColombian President Gustavo Petro announced Monday that his country would formally join the BRI \u2013 in a vote of confidence after several Chinese projects in Latin America hit snags in recent months.\nIn other pledges, Beijing plans to invite 300 members from Latin American political parties to China annually for the next three years and facilitate 3,500 government scholarships and various other types of exchanges.\nFive Latin American countries will receive visa exemptions for travel to China, with more to follow, Xi said. It was not immediately clear which countries would become visa exempt.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi contributed from Tokyo."

      "text": "A look at the Operation Condor conspiracy in South America\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 Argentina\u2019s last dictator and 14 other former military officials were sentenced to prison Friday for human rights crimes committed during the Operation Condor conspiracy. Here is a look at the clandestine program\u2019s main features:\nWHAT WAS OPERATION CONDOR?\nIt was a coordinated effort by the military dictatorships in Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia, Uruguay and Brazil to hunt down and eliminate opponents and leftists across the continent and beyond. It operated from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s.\nHOW DID IT WORK?\nOperation Condor officially began in 1975, when South America\u2019s dictatorships agreed to exchange information on political dissidents, trade unionists, students and anyone suspected of being a leftist, especially those who had sought refuge in other countries. According to declassified documents, various U.S. government agencies were aware of the plan.\nThe covert program involved the deployment of special transnational teams to kidnap subversive \u201ctargets,\u201d who were then interrogated and tortured in seven clandestine prisons located on military or police bases in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile. The dissidents were sometimes returned to their country of origin and disappeared.\nCondor\u2019s agents also assassinated political leaders seen as influencing public opinion against the military regimes. Some of their targets were in the United States and Europe. The September 1976 assassination of Orlando Letelier, the foreign minister under Chile\u2019s socialist President Salvador Allende, was the best-known case. Letelier and U.S. citizen Ronni Moffitt were killed by a bomb placed in his car in Washington D.C. Investigators found that the Chilean dictatorship\u2019s spy agency, known as DINA, and an anti-Castro group, many of whose members had been trained by the CIA, were behind the assassination.\nWHO WERE CONDOR\u2019S MASTERMINDS?\nChilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, Paraguayan strongman Alfredo Stroessner, Bolivia\u2019s Hugo Banzer, Argentine dictator Jorge Videla and Juan Maria Bordaberry of Uruguay. While no representative of Brazil signed the operation\u2019s charter, its government cooperated with the program and dissidents were killed and kidnapped in Brazilian territory.\nHOW MANY VICTIMS?\nAccording to a 2015 report by UNESCO\u2019s International Center for the Promotion of Human Rights, Operation Condor had 376 victims: 177 Uruguayans, 72 Argentines, 64 Chileans, 25 Paraguayans, 15 Peruvians, 12 Bolivians, five Brazilians, three Cubans, two Americans and a Spaniard.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Ronni Moffitt was not an aide to the former ambassador."

We will wage a social and legal battle.\u201d\nOn social media, he voiced alarm over \u201cthe grave threat facing democracy today.\u201d\nMorales has repeatedly promised that Bolivia would \u201cconvulse\u201d if the electoral tribunal bars him from the race, heightening a sense of crisis in the run-up to the deeply polarized vote scheduled for Aug. 17.\nPresident Arce dismissed their criticism, asking only that \u201cthe electoral dispute not generate political and economic instability.\u201d\nRodr\u00edguez \u2014 a fresh-faced 36-year-old candidate who generated excitement among voters disillusioned with Morales\u2019 fifth presidential bid and outraged with Arce\u2019s handling of Bolivia\u2019s worst economic crisis in 40 years \u2014 also called for protests against what he called \u201ca political decision\u201d to suspend his candidacy.\n\u201cNo ruling or judicial decision driven by political interests can overrule the sovereign will of the people,\u201d he wrote on X.\nThe Supreme Electoral Tribunal gave narrow, technical reasons for the decisions as the window closed for candidates to register their political parties.\nA power struggle between Morales and his former ally and finance minister, President Arce, has fractured their dominant Movement Toward Socialism party, or MAS, forcing Morales to break off and create his own political party.\nArce, whose popularity has plunged as inflation surges and fuel shortages paralyze the country, dropped out of the race last week and nominated his senior minister, Eduardo del Castillo, as the MAS party candidate.\nA stern-faced lawyer and loyalist of Arce who oversaw police crackdowns on anti-government protests over the last year, Del Castillo has struggled to summon the kind of support enjoyed by Morales and Rodr\u00edguez.\nDivisions are also splitting the vote on the right, which has left the anti-MAS movement without a clear front-runner to seize on what could otherwise be the opposition\u2019s first real shot at victory after almost two decades of left-wing rule.\nAccording to the list published Tuesday by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the successfully registered opposition candidates include Samuel Doria Medina, 66, a former cement tycoon notorious for his multiple unsuccessful presidential bids.\nThere\u2019s also Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga, who promoted market-friendly reforms as president from 2001-2002 after serving as vice president to the late military dictator, Hugo Banzer, in a government accused of widespread human rights abuses.\n\u201cMorales is out of the race,\u201d Tahuichi Tahuichi, a member of the board, declared on Tuesday.\nMorales\u2019 disqualification, though controversial, had been expected. His recently formed political faction, \u201cEvo Pueblo,\u201d lacks official party status, the electoral tribunal said, while an allied party that planned to host his candidacy failed to meet other legal requirements.\nEven as Morales continued to insist on the legitimacy of his candidacy, a divisive ruling by the Constitutional Tribunal that bans citizens from running for more than two presidential terms also complicates his path back to the presidency.\nSome analysts see that ruling \u2014 made by Arce-allied judges that interfered in judicial elections to extend their own terms \u2014 as emblematic of how the judiciary in Bolivia has been undermined by political wrangling.\n\u201cArce benefited from the rapid deterioration of the already weak justice system, failed to enact desperately needed reforms and manipulated the courts to his advantage,\u201d said Kathryn Ledebur, director of the Andean Information Network, a Bolivian research group.\n\u201cThis lack of due process and rule of law make the upcoming elections a free-for-all with an unpredictable, unsustainable outcome.\u201d\nMore surprising was the tribunal\u2019s decision to suspend Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s candidacy pending a hearing on the legality of his political alliance. Judges accepted his appeal and set a first tribunal session for Wednesday.\nThe new constraints on the candidates also drew criticism even from officials within the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.\n\u201cThe democratic system is at risk by legal actions affecting the normal development of elections,\u201d wrote Francisco Vargas, a member of the electoral body. \u201cI am alerting the country and the international community.\u201d\n___\nDeBre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n____\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america"

It\u2019s time for a return to the past.\nHis supporters are looking to Morales for a rescue from the five tumultuous years since his 2019 resignation. The country\u2019s first Indigenous president, Morales is credited with spreading the wealth of a commodities boom and ushering in a rare stretch of social and economic stability during his nearly 14 years in office.\nHis detractors say Morales \u2014 who built an economy uncomfortably dependent on natural gas reserves and sought to stay in power longer than Bolivia\u2019s constitution allows \u2014 bears responsibility for much of the turmoil that followed his tenure.\nAn ally turned rival\nA bitter political battle is looming between Morales, 65, and his former economy minister and once-prot\u00e9g\u00e9, President Luis Arce, over who will lead their long-dominant leftist Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, into the August 2025 election.\nArce has unleashed allies in the judiciary against Morales, with the Constitutional Court disqualifying Morales\u2019 candidacy and ousting him from the leadership of MAS, a party he helped found in the 1990s.\nProsecutors in mid-December charged Morales with statutory rape for fathering a child with a 15-year-old girl when he was 56 and president. Morales didn\u2019t deny the relationship but accused Arce of deploying a \u201cdirty, odious\u201d campaign to undermine him.\nFighting from the tropics\nSince talk of his arrest warrant surfaced in September, Morales has been holed up in Bolivia\u2019s coca-growing region of Chapare, ringed by loyal supporters.\nHere, the former coca farmer and fiery union leader \u2014 long considered one of the last of the so-called \u201cpink wave\u201d of leftist leaders who once dominated Latin American politics \u2014 is planning his comeback.\nFew outsiders are allowed inside his stronghold in Bolivia\u2019s steamy lowlands, but The Associated Press was invited last month for a look from behind the barricades.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want me to be the candidate because they know I\u2019ll win,\u201d Morales told the AP. \u201cWe\u2019re in a state of total siege, morally, legally and politically.\u201d\nThe four-hour drive to Chapare from Bolivia\u2019s third-biggest city of Cochabamba is steep and slick with mist.\nA narcotics checkpoint from the U.S.-financed war on drugs that wreaked havoc across this jungle is far less intimidating than the makeshift checkpoints manned by Morales\u2019 followers.\nIn the \u2018Land of Evo\u2019\nAs the van rumbled on, Pedro Cepita, a guide tasked with accompanying the AP, pointed out Morales\u2019 accomplishments in the long-stigmatized Chapare \u2014 university buildings, cell towers, an airport, a 25,000-seat soccer stadium.\nMorales\u2019 face adorns murals alongside cult heroes like Che Guevara and Fidel Castro. \u201cEvo 2025-2030\u201d slogans blanket brick houses.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in la Tierra de Evo,\u201d Cepita said \u2014 the Land of Evo.\nAt sandbagged checkpoints, Morales\u2019 supporters \u2014 some with batons on their belts \u2014 waved the van through only after recognizing Cepita.\nSecurity forces, chased out by Morales\u2019 followers, rarely venture here. Door-knocking census workers \u2014 even emergency rescuers responding to a deadly landslide last month \u2014 said they were harassed and kicked out by Morales\u2019 coca union activists.\nEarlier this month and after 40 days of negotiations, police began trickling back.\nAlmost divine reverence\nCoca farmers drying their leaves proudly recount how Morales kicked out U.S. anti-drug agents almost in the same breath as they extoll the benefits of the coca plant, cherished by Indigenous communities and maligned by the West as the raw material for cocaine.\n\u201cBrother Evo was in these fields with us,\u201d said Jose Luis Calicho, 39, nodding toward Morales\u2019 own plot of land. \u201cHe knows we\u2019re not criminals, we\u2019re not narco-traffickers.\u201d\nSince October, when gunmen opened fire at his convoy, Morales, who was unharmed, has slept inside the fortress-like compound of his coca-growing union. He says the shooting was an assassination attempt and blames Arce\u2019s government, which denies involvement.\nOutside the high walls, dozens of his followers lounge on tarps blocking the street. Some rest after all-night security shifts, others keep watch, their cheeks bulging with wads of coca \u2014 a mild stimulant.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility to Evo, we can\u2019t take chances,\u201d said Reyna Pe\u00f1aloza, 44. \u201cWith us, he\u2019ll return to power.\u201d\nA stark disconnect\nThose who believe Morales\u2019 comeback can close the door on years of political and economic paralysis are less clear about the kind of future he could bring.\n\u201cWhen I came to power in 2005, the nation was suffering, and I transformed it,\u201d Morales said. \u201cNow our crisis is even worse. We don\u2019t have fuel, we don\u2019t have dollars.\u201d\nMost Bolivians, stinging from surging inflation and waiting in long lines to fill their tanks, agree on that.\nBut attitudes toward Morales are starkly different in his remote redoubt in Chapare and the rest of the country of 12 million \u2014 especially when it comes to the 2016 statutory rape case that indelibly tarnished his reputation.\nIn the upscale districts of La Paz, the capital, residents say they\u2019re repulsed by his actions. Freshly painted graffiti asks: \u201cWould you vote for a pedophile?\u201d\n\u201cThe political damage to Evo\u2019s good image is devastating,\u201d said Romer Alejo, a criminal lawyer in La Paz.\nInformal efforts to gauge public opinion in La Paz suggests that two or three out of every 10 Bolivians would vote for him.\nHis critics condemn Morales\u2019 constitution-bending efforts to hold onto power longer than any leader in Bolivia\u2019s modern history.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a breaking point,\u201d said Mart\u00edn Sivak, the author of a biography on Morales. \u201cThere\u2019s a verdict from Bolivians on this idea of staying in power for too long.\u201d\nA long way to go\nLegal troubles aside, whether Morales can reclaim his party and the country\u2019s top job is unclear. His supporters say he\u2019ll find a way around the court ban \u2014 perhaps by launching a new party.\nBut the packed crowds of 2014 are no longer there.\nA recent MAS congress in Chapare declared Morales was the party\u2019s \u201conly legitimate candidate,\u201d but a \u201cViva, Evo!\u201d chant faded quickly in the half-full auditorium.\nStill, Bolivia\u2019s right-wing opposition is fractured. Protests are mounting over Arce\u2019s failure to halt a currency collapse. Morales\u2019 supporters threaten to convulse the country if he\u2019s not on the ballot.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll win through our struggle,\u201d Morales loyalist and lawmaker Alina Canaviri Sullcani said. \u201cThere\u2019s no alternative.\u201d\nEven if Morales has become too divisive, without him, many fear the long unstable Andean nation could veer back toward chaos.\nMorales\u2019 2019 ouster elevated a right-wing interim president, Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez, who cracked down on her political opponents and sought to purge Morales\u2019 legacy.\nOn a hot, sticky morning last month, Morales emerged from his hideout with heavy security, to check on his fields. As he hunched over to cut weeds, his aides pulled out their smartphones to film him \u2014 a throwback to the early 2000s, when videos of the son of llama famers in his humble alpaca sweater were a magnet for foreign media.\nBut Morales didn\u2019t seem to notice. When everyone had gone, he kept on working. He said he wasn\u2019t close to finishing."

They said the re-votes to be held Nov. 3 wouldn\u2019t change the outcome, but the development still added to the unrest over a long, contentious tally of ballots.\nWith 99.99% of votes counted, Morales had 47.07% to 36.51% for former President Carlos Mesa, who finished second in the nine-candidate field. That gave Morales a 10.56-point lead, a little more than a half point over the threshold he needed to win an outright victory and avoid a second-round ballot in December probably against a united opposition.\n\u201cWe won in the first round,\u201d Morales declared at news conference early in the day, after he first edged over the threshold during the night. The president, the region\u2019s longest-serving leader who is seeking a fourth consecutive term, said he was bolstered by the rural vote.\nMorales later backtracked a bit, saying he would be open to a runoff if he fell short of the 10-point lead when official totals were announced.\nA communique issued by Colombia\u2019s foreign ministry on behalf of the U.S., Brazil and Argentina said the governments of the four nations \u201cwill only recognize results that reflect the will of the Bolivian people.\u201d\nThe European Union took a similar stand, saying it backed a call by the Organization of American States for a second-round election that could help Bolivia regain its footing after days of sometimes violent protests by opposition supporters angered by the slow vote count and an unexplained 24-hour halt in the release of results.\n\u201cThe European Union shares the OAS\u2019 assessment that the best option would be to make a runoff to restore trust and ensure full respect for the democratic elections of the Bolivian people,\u201d the EU said in a statement that also called for the parties to refrain from further violence.\nThere was no comment from Morales about the outsiders\u2019 questions on the fairness of the election\u2019s opening round.\nOpposition leaders were united in rejecting Morales\u2019 victory claim as the president\u2019s supporters were out celebrating. Analysts have said a united opposition might stand a chance in a second round of defeating Morales, a leftist former coca-growers union leader who has governed the Andean nation for 14 years.\nFlanked by other opposition leaders, Mesa read a statement calling for \u201ccitizens and social groups to remain peacefully mobilized until they obtain respect for the will of the people.\u201d\nMorales, in turn, urged his supporters to defend his win and denied electoral fraud, demanding his detractors show proof.\n\u201cWe are at the start of a crisis that could affect the social, political and economic stability of the country,\u201d said political analyst Jorge Dul\u00f3n at Bolivian Catholic University.\nThe Andean nation has been on a knife-edge since the bitterly disputed vote.\nOpposition backers have stage rowdy protests since Monday and burned Supreme Electoral Tribunal offices in three cities. The opposition bastion of Santa Cruz has seen two days of a partial strike \u201cin defense of the vote and democracy.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Morales supporters announced marches in the coca-growing region of Chapare, a bastion of support for the president.\nInternational vote monitors have questioned the early daylong gap in reporting results before a sudden spurt in Morales\u2019 vote percentage. An OAS observer mission released a statement expressing its \u201cconcern and surprise over the drastic change and difficult to justify tendency in the preliminary results.\u201d\nMorales had repeatedly said since late Sunday that he won the vote outright and that his opponents are conspiring to oust him.\nSuspicions of electoral fraud rose when officials abruptly stopped releasing results from the quick count of votes hours after the polls closed Sunday. Morales was leading at the time, but also falling several percentage points short of the 10-ppoint edge he needed to avoid being forced into a runoff for the first time in his four election contests.\nTwenty-four hours later, the electoral body suddenly released an updated figure, with 95% of votes counted, showing Morales just 0.7 percentage point short of the 10-point advantage. Since then, results have slowly been updated.\nMorales, 59, a native Aymara from Bolivia\u2019s highlands, became the country\u2019 first indigenous president in 2006 and easily won the two following elections amid more than a decade of a commodities-fed economic boom in South America\u2019s poorest country. He paved roads, sent Bolivia\u2019s first satellite to space and curbed inflation.\nBut he has faced growing dissatisfaction, especially over his refusal to accept the results of a 2016 referendum to keep limits on presidential terms. The country\u2019s top court, considered by critics as friendly to the president, ruled that limits would violate Morales\u2019 political rights as a citizen."

Police said 20 people were detained.\nSanta Cruz, an eastern city that is a stronghold of opposition sentiment, has been paralyzed by protests.\nSupporters of Mesa say results from the Oct. 20 election were rigged to give Morales enough votes to avoid a second round that he might lose to a unified opposition.

Soon Mexico will, too, after former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador pushed through a highly contentious overhaul of the justice system in the face of mass protests.\nAs Bolivia\u2019s ex-President Evo Morales did when remaking the judiciary in 2009, L\u00f3pez Obrador has championed the overhaul as a way to purge the corrupt elite and boost democracy.\nBolivia\u2019s current President Luis Arce on Sunday hailed the elections as a \u201cmilestone in democracy\u201d as he cast his ballot in La Paz.\nBut apathetic Bolivian voters say the elections have so far had the opposite effect, turning their courts from neutral arbiters into political prizes.\n\u201cI\u2019ll flip a coin,\u201d said 25-year-old architecture student Marisol Nogales when asked how she would vote.\nVoting is mandatory in Bolivia, and long lines snaking from polling stations across the country exacerbated public frustration over the election.\n\u201cMost of us who came to vote don\u2019t know the candidates,\u201d said Franz Condori, queuing under the bright sun in the western highland town of Jesus de Machaca. \u201dThis has to change.\u201d\nIt\u2019s never easy to find supporters of Bolivia\u2019s system of electing judges, which, over a decade ago, replaced a nomination system rooted in qualifications and training.\nAcross the world, academics, investors and judges have warned that judicial elections can cement the dominance of the ruling party and gut checks and balances. Across Latin America, from El Salvador to Honduras, experts have characterized politicized judiciaries as profound threats to democracy.\nOver 50 countries go to the polls in 2024\n- The year will test even the most robust democracies. Read more on what\u2019s to come here.\n- Take a look at the 25 places where a change in leadership could resonate around the world.\n- Keep track of the latest AP elections coverage from around the world here.\nIn Bolivia, even senior judicial officials struggle to defend the election.\n\u201cCitizens don\u2019t like this system of electing judges, but it\u2019s what we have,\u201d said Oscar Hssenteufel, president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, as he kicked off Sunday\u2019s vote.\nFrancisco Vargas, the tribunal\u2019s vice president, strained to sound positive.\n\u201cIt should be a calm, easy and simple process,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cIt has become very litigious, very controversial.\u201d\nSunday\u2019s vote was supposed to take place in late 2023, but as that deadline approached the Constitutional Court \u2014 packed with allies of Arce \u2014 suddenly intervened to push it back a year, escalating his power struggle with his former mentor and current rival, Morales, over who will lead their long-dominant leftist party into Bolivia\u2019s 2025 presidential election.\nBoth understand that whoever wins over the Constitutional Court ensures their own political survival.\nArce cited the paralysis of their divided party in justifying the vote\u2019s delay. Morales\u2019 loyalists, who hold a majority in Congress and could have determined the shortlist of judicial candidates, accused Arce of illegally extending the mandates of friendly judges for fear of losing influence over the courts.\n\u201cWhat happened was disorder, the kind that can lead us to a greater conflict,\u201d said Iv\u00e1n Lima, a former minister of justice.\nWith voting underway, results are expected within a week. But there\u2019s a wrinkle: it\u2019s a partial election. Only four out of nine seats on the powerful Constitutional Court are up for grabs. The other five \u2014 the majority of sitting judges, as it happens \u2014 will stay in their posts.\n\u201cThe judges have turned the Constitutional Court into a sort of super power,\u201d said Bolivian political analyst Paul Coca.\nSunday marks the third time that Bolivia has held judicial elections. If the past two rounds under then-President Morales, in 2011 and 2017, are any indication, turnout will be low. Both times, the majority of Bolivians, outraged or simply baffled by the notion of endorsing unknown judges pre-selected by Morales\u2019 allies with little transparency, voted null.\nCritics questioned the legitimacy of the elected judges. But they nonetheless shaped the course of Bolivian democracy.\nIn 2016, Morales asked Bolivians in a legally binding referendum to decide whether to let him run for a fourth term, in defiance of a two-term limit established in the 2009 Constitution he had backed.\nWhen he didn\u2019t get the answer he wanted \u2014 a majority voted \u201cno\u201d \u2014 his party found a workaround through the Constitutional Court, where pliant judges ruled that denying Morales another term as president would violate his human rights.\n\u201cThis was his major mistake,\u201d said Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez Veltz\u00e9, a former chief justice of the Supreme Court.\nIt was Morales\u2019 decision to run again in 2019 that brought a precipitous end to his remarkable 14-year tenure and ushered in a surreal parade of crises. As allegations of electoral fraud sent angry crowds into the streets, Morales resigned under pressure from the military and went into exile.\nFive years after coming under fire for allegedly manipulating the courts, Morales now finds himself on the receiving end of the judiciary he overhauled.\n\u201cFirst Evo\u2019s party used the court to challenge the referendum\u2019s results to promote another candidacy. Then Arce\u2019s administration colluded with the same Constitutional Court to delay and reduce judicial elections to favor the self-prorogated judges running politics through judicial review,\u201d Veltz\u00e9 said.\nThe court endorsed a controversial ruling last year that Arce insists blocks Morales from running for president in 2025. Prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Morales in October 2023 after reviving a 2016 statutory rape case against him.\nAnd earlier this week, the country\u2019s top criminal court swiftly extradited Morales\u2019 former anti-drug chief to stand trial in the United States on charges of cocaine trafficking, despite criticism from legal experts unsatisfied by the court\u2019s review of evidence.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to destroy me morally, legally and politically,\u201d Morales told the AP.\nVargas is quick to insist that Bolivia is not some kind of strange outlier for electing judges. The U.S., Switzerland and Japan also hold judicial elections. But, he conceded, not in such a sweeping way as Bolivia does, or as Mexico will.\nMexico\u2019s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, bracing for fallout from the overhaul she inherited, is keen to see how Bolivia\u2019s vote plays out. The National Electoral Institute, the Mexican voting authority, sent a delegation to observe the process in La Paz this weekend, Vargas said.\nWhen asked whether he would recommend that Mexico follow Bolivia\u2019s example, Vargas let out a sharp laugh.\n\u201cIf you want me to tell you my personal opinion,\u201d he said, \u201cit might cause me some problems.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writer Carlos Valdez in La Paz, Bolivia, contributed to this report."

In a victory speech from the balcony of the presidential palace in La Paz, Morales dedicated his victory to Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro and the late Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez.\n\u201cIt is triumph of the anti-colonialists and anti-imperialists,\u201d Morales said in a booming voice. \u201cWe are going to keep growing and we are going to continue the process of economic liberation.\u201d\nMorales won eight of Bolivia\u2019s nine states, including the former opposition stronghold of Santa Cruz, an agribusiness center in the eastern lowlands where he polled 51 percent, according to Ipsos.\nMorales will now eclipse as Bolivia\u2019s longest-serving leader consecutively in office the 19th century Marshal Andres de Santa Cruz, a founder of the republic in power from 1829-1839.\nWhile known internationally for his anti-imperialist and socialist rhetoric, the 55-year-old coca growers\u2019 union leader is widely popular at home for a pragmatic economic stewardship that spread Bolivia\u2019s natural gas and mineral wealth among the masses.\nA boom in commodities prices increased export revenues nine-fold and the country has accumulated $15.5 billion in international reserves. Economic growth has averaged 5 percent annually, well above the regional average. A half a million people have put poverty behind them since Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president first took office in 2006.\nPublic works projects abound, including a satellite designed to deliver Internet to rural schools, a fertilizer plant and La Paz\u2019s gleaming new cable car system. His newest promise: to light up La Paz with nuclear power.\n\u201cI voted for Evo Morales because he doesn\u2019t forget the elderly,\u201d said Maria Virginia Velasquez, a 70-year-old widow. Universal old-age pensions \u2014 Velasquez gets $36 a month \u2014 are among the benefits instituted by Morales that have boosted his popularity.\nMorales had sought Sunday to improve on his previous best showing \u2014 64 percent in 2009 \u2014 and to maintain a two-thirds control of Bolivia\u2019s Senate and assembly. That would let him change the constitution, which restricts presidents to two 5-year terms, so he can run again.\nHe has not said whether he would seek a fourth term, only that he would \u201crespect the constitution.\u201d He did say in a TV interview last week, however, that he didn\u2019t believe people over the age of 60 should be president.\nA court ruled last year that Morales could run for a third term because his first preceded a constitutional rewrite. All seats were up for grabs in the 36-member Senate and 130-member lower house. Results were not immediately available.\nMorales\u2019 critics say he spent tens of millions in government money on his campaign, giving him an unfair advantage. And press freedom advocates accuse him of gradually silencing critical media by letting government allies buy them out. Morales didn\u2019t attend the campaign\u2019s lone presidential debate and state TV didn\u2019t broadcast it.\n\u201cThere is no functional opposition, left, right or otherwise,\u201d said Jim Shultz, executive director of the left-leaning Democracy Center based in Bolivia and San Francisco.\nMorales has capitalized on his everyman image while his Movement Toward Socialism party has consolidated control over state institutions. He long ago crushed and splintered the opposition, nationalized key utilities and renegotiating natural gas contracts to give the government a bigger share of profits.\nHis image-makers built a cult of personality around him. Stadiums, markets, schools, state enterprises and even a village bear Morales\u2019 name. In the center of the capital, crews are building a second presidential palace, a 20-story center complete with a heliport.\nYet Morales has alienated environmentalists and many former indigenous allies by promoting mining and a planned jungle highway through an indigenous reserve.\nAnd despite Bolivia\u2019s economic advancements, it is still among South America\u2019s poorest countries. Nearly one in five Bolivians lives on less than a dollar a day.\nMany analysts think Bolivia depends too much on natural resources and is especially susceptible to the current easing in commodities demand from China.\n\u201cEvo\u2019s balancing act will be increasingly tough to maintain,\u201d said Michael Shifter, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue think tank. \u201cAlthough Evo has proven to be a resourceful and resilient politician, who knows his country well, it would be surprising if the next five years go as swimmingly as the last five.\u201d\nMorales\u2019 dreams of converting its lithium reserves into battery factories have yet to be realized, as are plans to create a major iron foundry.\nThe underground cocaine economy gets credit for part of the economic boom. Peru\u2019s former drug czar, Ricardo Soberon, estimates its annual revenues at $2.3 billion, equal to about 7 percent of gross domestic product.\nMorales promotes coca\u2019s traditional uses and claims zero tolerance for cocaine.\nThe United States deems Bolivia uncooperative in the war on drugs and has halted trade preferences and cut all counter-narcotics aid. Morales expelled the U.S. ambassador and Drug Enforcement Administration in 2008, accusing them of inciting the opposition.\nLast year he threw out the U.S. Agency for International Development.\nRonald Velasquez, a 38-year-old computer specialist, said he voted for Morales because he didn\u2019t trust any of the other candidates. He said he trusts Morales but the president \u201cis surrounded by bad associates.\u201d\n\u201cHe has had a lot of problems in his government with corruption and influence-peddling,\u201d Velasquez said.\nMacario Chambi, a 54-year-old street vendor, said he would not vote for Morales, whose ruling clique he believes is getting rich off the economic bonanza without instituting the type of reforms that will actually create wealth.\n\u201cHe thinks we\u2019re all sheep, that we don\u2019t realize that they want to buy us with cheap sweets.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writers Paola Flores contributed from La Paz and Frank Bajak from Lima, Peru."

That was the engine of robust growth in the early 2000s, a period of booming exports and declining poverty that experts have termed Bolivia\u2019s \u201ceconomic miracle.\u201d\n\u201cThis marks the beginning of a new chapter for the northern sub-Andean region, offering hope of maintaining our country as an important gas exporter,\u201d said Arce, who is the alleged target of a military coup attempt last month and the main focus of anger among Bolivians over shortages of fuel and foreign currency. \u201cIt\u2019s the most important discovery since 2005.\u201d\nIn more recent years, investment in exploration projects by Bolivia\u2019s state-owned energy company has dwindled and natural gas extraction has faded fast.\nBolivian politicians spent much of the gas windfall on lavishly subsidized fuel. The economic model pioneered by then President Evo Morales, Arce\u2019s bitter political rival, quickly became unsustainable when commodity prices fell.\nIn a warning for the government, the Bolivian Institute of Foreign Trade reported last year that the country \u2014 once among the world\u2019s top 10 natural gas producers \u2014 had become a net importer of hydrocarbons, spending $2.9 billion on diesel imports while earning only $2 billion from natural gas exports.\nLast month, Arce described production as having \u201chit rock bottom.\u201d\nBolivia\u2019s state-controlled energy company, Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales Bolivianos, or YPFB, said Monday that the newly announced natural gas field was discovered thanks to a $50 million investment.\nThe field, it said, covers several regions north of La Paz, the administrative capital, and will add to Bolivia\u2019s existing gas reserves, which stood at 8.7 trillion cubic meters in 2019. There has been no publicly available data since.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new exploratory frontier,\u201d said Armin Dorgathen, YPFB president."

Opinion polls show that his pick for the presidency, senior minister Eduardo del Castillo, has inherited the president\u2019s unpopularity.\nArce\u2019s government insists that its main rival, Morales, is constitutionally barred from running. Morales accuses Arce of waging a \u201cjudicial war\u201d against him.\nIn leaving out Morales, the tribunal opened the potential for further turmoil: Morales has called on his supporters to take to the streets to demand his eligibility. Over the last week his followers have blockaded some of the main roads around the country, adding to a sense of crisis as merchants and truckers rise up in outrage over surging food prices and severe fuel shortages.\nMorales, who governed Bolivia from 2006 to 2019, has been holed up in the country\u2019s tropics for months, surrounded by fiercely loyal coca-farmers, as Arce\u2019s government seeks his arrest on charges relating to his sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl.\nA constitutional court filled with judges beholden to Arce has disputed the legality of Morales\u2019 fourth candidacy and barred him from the contest.\n\u201cThe constitutional court acts like a sniper ... restricting and enabling electoral participation upon request,\u201d he said in response to his disqualification. \u201cThe order is clear: Hand over the government to the right and legitimize the election with negotiated candidates who will protect their backs.\u201d\nMorales, whose own loyalists packed the same court when he was president, points to an earlier court ruling that paved the way for his 2019 presidential campaign, that said it would violate his human rights to stop him running. Morales\u2019 bid that year for an unprecedented fourth term ultimately sparked mass protests and led to his resignation and brief self-exile.\nThe conservative opposition to MAS is also fractured, with at least three right-of-center candidates vying for the presidency and no clear frontrunner.\nAll of them are little-known abroad but well-known within Bolivia, where they have run for president or served in government in the past: Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga, former president from 2001-2002, Samuel Doria Medina, a former cement tycoon and planning minister, and Manfred Reyes Villa, the mayor of Bolivia\u2019s major central city of Cochabamba.\nQuiroga and Doria Medina promoted privatizations of state-run companies in the 1990s before MAS took over."

The country\u2019s first indigenous chief of state upended politics in a nation long ruled by light-skinned descendants of Europeans and he vowed to reverse centuries of inequality. He succeeded on many fronts but was ultimately compelled to step down after both the military and even one-time supporters turned against him.\n___\nWHY WAS HIS PRESIDENCY SO NOTABLE?\nWhen Morales, the son of a llama herder, won Bolivia\u2019s highest office in a landslide 2006 election, it was hailed as a milestone achievement for the nation\u2019s sizeable indigenous population that had not gained the right to vote until 1952.\nAt the time, Bolivia\u2019s 36 indigenous groups represented 60% of its 8.5 million citizens. A native Aymara, Morales was the first leader for many Bolivians who looked and thought like they did.\nLike many Bolivians, Morales grew up in extreme poverty. Four of his six siblings died in childhood. On the campaign trail, he ditched the traditional politico\u2019s suit and tie, preferring casual short-sleeved shirts and even a leather jacket, while affectionately calling women \u201csister\u201d and men \u201cboss.\u201d\nHe earned a spot in the political limelight as the leader of a coca growers union who played an important role in protests that unseated two governments and vowed to reverse centuries of inequities against the disenfranchised.\n\u201cThe time has come to change this terrible history of looting our natural resources, of discrimination, of hate, of despise,\u201d he said after his triumph.\n___\nHOW DID HE CHANGE THE SOUTH AMERICAN NATION?\nUnder Morales\u2019 tenure, more than a half-million Bolivians climbed out of poverty, while schoolchildren, the elderly and mothers benefited from new subsidies. The economy grew strongly thanks to high prices for its commodities.\nAccording to the World Bank, moderate poverty stood at 59% of Bolivia\u2019s people two years before Morales became president and had fallen to 39% by 2014.\nHe ushered through a new constitution that created a new Congress with seats reserved for Bolivia\u2019s smaller indigenous groups and recognized the Andean earth deity Pachamama instead of the Roman Catholic Church. The charter also \u201crefounded\u201d Bolivia as a \u201cplurinational\u201d state, allowing self-rule for the nation\u2019s indigenous peoples.\nHowever, despite fears of some that Morales would oversee a stark turn to the left economically, he kept the nation dependent on extractive industries while negotiating more favorable terms that allowed greater distribution of gas and mineral wealth.\n___\nWHAT WAS HIS DOWNFALL?\nThere is no one easy moment to identify, but rather a series of missteps that led to his exit.\nThe same indigenous organizers who propelled Morales to power grew increasingly disenchanted with a president they felt betrayed promises to protect the environment and move away from reliance on big industries like mining. Thousands took to the streets in 2011 when he proceeded with plans for a highway across a protected Amazon reserve.\nAnd despite improving economic indicators, a substantial part of the new middle class found job opportunities hadn\u2019t expanded sufficiently and also grew fed up with corruption many felt the president did not combat.\nWhen Morales held a 2016 referendum on removing term limits, voters turned him down. He then upset many people by getting Bolivia\u2019s top court to throw out the limits, allowing him to seek a fourth term in this year\u2019s election.\nHe claimed victory in the Oct. 20 ballot, but unexplained lapses in reporting results drew allegations of vote fraud and set off weeks of protests by his opponents. His support weakened, and finally a push by the chief of the Bolivian military led him to resign.\n\u201cIf he had tried not to force the issue of running again, he probably would have been remembered fairly positively,\u201d said Alissandra Stoyan, a professor of political science at Kansas State University.\n___\nWHAT MIGHT BE THE RIPPLE EFFECT OF HIS DEPARTURE?\nHis resignation comes at a time of social upheaval around Latin America coinciding with what those on the left hoped might be a comeback.\nFrustrated citizens have staged mass protests against right-wing leaders in Honduras and Chile and voters in Argentina thrust the Peronist party back into power in a rejection of an incumbent backing free market reforms.\nBut Morales\u2019 party, the Movement for Socialism, now will likely face an uphill battle against an empowered opposition in a new presidential election.\n\u201cIt seems Latin America is getting more complex over the last few years and we can\u2019t talk about \u2018tides\u2019 like we used to,\u201d said Jorge Derpic, a University of Georgia sociology professor focused on Latin American social movements.\n___\nIS BOLIVIA\u2019S DEMOCRACY AT RISK?\nSome people are concerned Bolivia could be turning back a page to a turbulent time in its long history of political volatility, after nearly 14 years of relative stability under Morales.\nBy one count, Bolivia has had more than 190 coup attempts and revolutions since its 1825 independence in a repetitive cycle of conflict between political elites in urban areas and disenfranchised by mobilized rural sectors.\nThere is uncertainty over who will step in to fill the power vacuum before elections can be held. An opposition leader in the Senate proclaimed herself interim president Tuesday, though it isn\u2019t clear how much support she has.\nNancy Postero, an anthropology professor at the University of California, San Diego, is optimistic Bolivia\u2019s young and educated middle class will find a way out, recalling how over a decade ago Morales himself charted a path toward stability after the wave of upheaval the preceded him.\n\u201cThe Bolivian people wrote a new constitution, remade society and came up with a completely different way of thinking about the state,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no doubt that is going to happen again.\u201d"

Unlike American or European shoppers scrutinizing suspiciously capacious chip bags, Bolivians have no doubt that they\u2019re paying the same government-fixed price for a much smaller, lower-quality loaf.\nFor years, you could walk into a government-subsidized bakery like Castillo\u2019s anywhere in Bolivia and get a 100-gram (3.5 ounce) roll for 50 centavos (7 U.S. cents), but as a cash crunch cripples flour imports and inflation squeezes budgets, bakers have almost halved the size of their staple bread. Early last year, rolls shrank to 80 grams, then 70, now 60.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like eating a bit of air, a Communion wafer, it doesn\u2019t fill you up anymore,\u201d said Rosario Manuelo Chura, 40, dipping some crust into her morning coffee in Bolivia\u2019s administrative capital of La Paz.\nCastillo isn\u2019t particularly pleased about it either. Forced to sell his bread far below market price, he\u2019s barely breaking even. \u201cThis situation is not sustainable,\u201d he said, slamming the oven door open.\nBolivia\u2019s many harbingers of havoc ahead of its presidential election on Sunday seem to converge in this shrunken piece of subsidized bread that La Paz residents call \u201cpan de batalla\u201d \u2014 \u201cbattle bread.\u201d\nThe hallowed staple speaks to a state stuck in the past after 20 years under the state-directed economic model of ex-leader Evo Morales, and now struggling to pull itself out of its worst economic crisis in four decades.\nThe right-wing frontrunners, businessman Samuel Doria Medina and former President Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga, have proposed eliminating the politically combustible subsidies that underwrite Bolivia\u2019s social safety net.\n\u201cI say this openly, I\u2019ll remove subsidies because they\u2019re the greatest absurdity,\u201d Doria Medina told The Associated Press this month, referring to the fuel that Bolivia subsidizes to the tune of billions of dollars a year.\nShort on dough, literally\nLegend has it that the battle bread earned its nickname from troop rations in the country\u2019s Chaco War against Paraguay in the 1930s.\nToday, a battle over bread rages within Bolivia, which is running out of hard currency to import wheat because the country grows less than 25% of what it consumes.\nStruggling to clear a backlog of imports, the government has slowed or in some cases suspended subsidized flour deliveries. Loaves have vanished from shelves and bread lines have started to appear across La Paz.\nThe scarcity of U.S. dollars has also hampered diesel fuel imports, leading to fuel shortages and raising questions about the ability of import-dependent Bolivia to keep subsidizing its staples.\nNot only do farmers use diesel fuel to power machinery for irrigation, but diesel fuel also contributes to the price of imported foodstuffs.\nPrices rise and loaves shrink\nSome two years ago Bolivia had a lower annual inflation rate than Germany. Today it has among the region\u2019s highest, with the government reporting consumer prices rose 25% in July from a year earlier.\nBut the price of bread hasn\u2019t changed in 17 years.\nBolivia imports most of its wheat from Argentina, where prices have increased \u2014 along with the value of the Argentine peso \u2014 under libertarian President Javier Milei.\nBolivia\u2019s grain agency, EMAPA, distributes the subsidized flour to bakers at a fixed price while requiring them to sell battle bread for 50 centavos a loaf \u2014 about a fifth of what it would cost to bake the same loaf with ingredients bought at retail prices.\nAs the prices of other ingredients climb, many government-subsidized bakeries warn that they are facing bankruptcy. Scores of bakers last month staged a 24-hour strike demanding to sell their bread at market prices.\nBut a quick scan of history from the 1789 French Revolution to 1989 Venezuelan riots underscores why Morales\u2019 Movement Toward Socialism party, or MAS, hasn\u2019t dared tinker with the agreement.\n\u201cWhen the price of battle bread goes up, that\u2019s the day everything collapses,\u201d said Jacobo Choque, 40, an accountant waiting to buy bread rich in butter from a non-subsidized bakery. The line of Bolivians keen to shell out an extra 20 centavos for better-tasting, thicker rolls stretched almost two city blocks.\nNearby, cash-strapped customers scoured an open-air market, swarming around one of the few stalls selling battle bread.\n\u201cWe used to have breakfast with one roll, but now we need two to feel full,\u201d said Carmen Mu\u00f1oz, 65, fuming as she queued. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that socialism brought us here.\u201d\nA subsidy system gone bust\nWhen commodity prices surged in 2007, Morales, a coca-farming union leader elected the year before to his first of what would be three terms, harnessed revenues from booming natural gas exports to bankroll subsidies for bread and other essentials.\nBut as gas production plummeted about a decade later, MAS dipped into foreign reserves to keep spending. The model became ruinously costly \u2014 last year\u2019s food and fuel subsidies made up over 4.2% of gross domestic product.\nWith the government unable to pay suppliers on time and trucks trapped in fuel lines, EMAPA\u2019s monthly deliveries of milled wheat have hit snags, leaving subsidized bakeries suddenly without flour. Even as bakers eat into their savings to buy other ingredients, the subsidy agreement bars them from sourcing their own flour.\n\u201cRather than helping, subsidies are hurting us,\u201d Castillo said.\nSome bakers say that EMAPA \u2014 long accused of favoring MAS party members \u2014 has stopped supplying altogether.\nEMAPA denies cronyism, saying it has ramped up investigations into reports of bakers reselling subsidized flour at inflated prices on the black market, or trying to pass off rolls baked with low-cost additives like cassava starch.\n\u201cIn all my 30 years at this market, this is the most stressful,\u201d said Raquel de Quino, a 60-year-old bread vendor who now spends her mornings confronting customers outraged over the shrinkflation and shortages.\nOn Saturday, she asked one angry woman to take her rant to the government \u2014 at least for its final week in power.\n\u201cI\u2019m just the middleman,\u201d said De Quino, throwing up her hands in exasperation. \u201cLet\u2019s pray to God that under the next government, there will bread for our children.\u201d\n____\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america"

The interim government that replaced him has also been accused of undermining Bolivia\u2019s democratic institutions, including the judiciary.\nThe feud has reverberated outside the landlocked country of 12 million people, echoing ideological divisions from an era when the political left and right in Latin America were more clearly defined.\nIn a speech to the virtual U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday, interim President Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez accused neighboring Argentina, where Morales is in self-exile, of \u2033systematic and abusive harassment\u2033 of Bolivia\u2019s institutions and supporting a \u201cviolent conspiracy\u201d led by the former president.\nArgentina\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it was regrettable that \u00c1\u00f1ez, who has withdrawn from the Bolivian election race, would try to involve Argentina in her country\u2019s internal politics and urged her to focus energy on ensuring \u2033free and transparent\u2033 elections.\nIn a letter Tuesday to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Sen. Bernie Sanders and 27 other members of the U.S. Congress expressed concern that the Organization of American States, based in Washington, had been invited to monitor the Bolivian election. The letter alleged a \u201clack of accountability and transparency\u201d in an OAS audit that found evidence of fraud and other irregularities in 2019 election results indicating Morales had won.\nMorales, a 60-year-old former coca farmer and union leader, faces terrorism and other charges in Bolivia and is not an election candidate this year. Some human rights advocates believe the charges amount to political persecution of Morales, who is basically in campaign mode, talking up his past administration\u2019s achievements.\nThe party that he founded, Movement for Socialism, also known by its Spanish acronym MAS, controls the congress and is a powerful election contender. Its presidential candidate, Luis Arce, is a former economy minister who oversaw a nationalization program when Morales was president.\nThe other main candidates draw much of their support from Bolivia\u2019s urban, more affluent population and should benefit from \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s withdrawal from the race. Carlos Mesa is a former president who ran in last year\u2019s election against Morales, and Luis Fernando Camacho led protests against Morales and is strong in Santa Cruz, an eastern region that is Bolivia\u2019s economic engine and a counterweight to the political dominance of La Paz, in the west.\nSeveral polls indicate the Movement for Socialism would lead in the round of voting next month, but struggle for the support needed to avoid a runoff pitting the top two candidates against each other. If there should be a runoff, MAS would come under more pressure if its opponents united.\nThere is a high number of undecided voters, said Mar\u00eda Teresa Zegada, a sociology professor at the Universidad Mayor de San Sim\u00f3n, a Bolivian university.\nMorales\u2019 detractors fear a MAS election victory could open the way to the former president\u2019s return to Bolivia and his political rehabilitation.\nWhatever happens, Bolivians could face more weak governance, political volatility and economic hardship at a time when the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown measures are undoing years of progress toward alleviating poverty.\nIn a joint statement last weekend, Bolivian church leaders, the European Union and the United Nations welcomed \u2018\u2019the most active phase of the electoral process\u2019\u2019 in Bolivia and appealed for people to refrain from violence or intimidation.\nMany Bolivians are apprehensive.\n\u201cWe are not excited about the elections. We are interested in generating economic reactivation policies,\u201d said H\u00e9ctor Delgado, a carpenter and union leader in El Alto, a city next to La Paz that suffers high unemployment and a lack of basic services.\nThis week, Moody\u2019s Investors Service issued a ratings downgrade for Bolivia, noting the pandemic and weaker foreign exchange earnings because of lower demand for Bolivian oil and gas. Bolivia has a favorable debt structure and the outlook is stable, even as the country endures its first recession since the 1980s, the credit ratings agency said.\n\u201cGiven Bolivia\u2019s weak institutional and governance framework, a highly polarized society, and fragile social fabric, Moody\u2019s expects a prolonged period of political instability and policy uncertainty, even after the upcoming October election is held,\u2033 the agency said.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Carlos Valdez reported this story in La Paz, Bolivia, and AP writer Christopher Torchia reported from Mexico City."

A new system has now been established to buy the currency online. The physical lines have disappeared, but the problem remains and is reminding Bolivians of past economic woes.\nAlicia Meneses, 40, said she had converted her savings into dollars earlier this year, \u201cbecause I was afraid of getting stuck with the bolivianos like what happened to my dad in the \u201980s.\u201d\nShe needed some local currency this week and so she changed a bit of her savings back to bolivians on the black market in downtown La Paz, where she received 7 bolivianos per dollar, slightly more than the official rate of 6.96.\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to change a few dollars because of an emergency,\u201d Meneses said.\nLeftist President Luis Arce, who was economy minister from 2006 to 2017 during Bolivia\u2019s period of bonanza, has tried to calm the waters, insisting there will be no change to the country\u2019s managed exchange rate system in which the Central Bank has intervened to keep the local currency\u2019s value stable to the U.S. dollar over the past 12 years.\n\u201cThere will be no devaluation,\u201d Arce said this week in what was his first interview with a private television station since taking office in late 2020. \u201cThere is no need for it when we have a solid economy that is growing.\u201d\nThe president dismissed speculation he would do away with expensive fuel subsidies that mean Bolivians pay around half of international prices for gasoline \u2014 at the cost of draining the country\u2019s international reserves. And Arce painted an optimistic picture: \u201cWe\u2019re growing and have the lowest inflation in the region.\u201d\nBolivia\u2019s annual inflation of 2.5% in March marks a decline from late last year when it crossed the 3% mark and is far lower than its neighbors. The government insists Bolivia will grow 4.8% this year, a sharp contrast to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s prediction of 1.8%.\n\u201cI\u2019ll disappoint international projections again,\u201d Arce quipped.\nBolivia, an exporter of natural gas for the region, enjoyed a huge economic bonanza over the last decade on the back of high commodity prices, a trend that followed the arrival in power in 2006 of Evo Morales, the country\u2019s first Indigenous president. The landlocked South American country also exports minerals and agricultural products, including soybeans, and has recently seen a surge in gold sales abroad.\nMorales used the huge flow of money to reduce poverty, expand the middle class, and build roads. Buildings multiplied in cities, and cars ceased to be a luxury. But that came accompanied with lots of waste and corruption, according to his detractors.\nThe country\u2019s revenues tripled with the nationalization of hydrocarbon resources in 2006, but the sector stagnated due to a lack of investment, and the country went from being an exporter to an importer of hydrocarbons in 2022, according to the National Statistics Institute.\n\u201cThey have squandered the money. Now there\u2019s a lack of liquidity,\u201d said Rodrigo Paz, a senator with the center-right Comunidad Ciudadana party. \u201cPeople are buying dollars due to uncertainty, but those dollars don\u2019t return to the market, they stay under the mattress.\u201d\nThe commodity price boom ended in 2014, and Bolivia managed to stretch its savings for several years but now, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the country is almost out of reserves.\nThe government is optimistic it will be able to make up some of the shortfall with the growth in gold mining, but tax revenue from that sector is scant. Of the $3 billion in gold exports last year, public coffers received only $75 million in taxes, according to official data.\n\u201cWe\u2019re scraping the barrel,\u201d said analyst Gonzalo Ch\u00e1vez, who is an economics professor at Catholic University of Bolivia.\nBolivia can no longer rely on commodities to carry the economy, La Paz-based economic consultant Jaime Dunn said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exhausted economic model that based its success on capturing the surplus generated by natural resources, not on generating wealth. It worked when raw materials fetched high prices,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cThe only way to keep it alive is by burning more currency and increasing debt, which already stands at around 70% of GDP.\u201d\nDunn says the government should do more to promote the agricultural sector that has been silently growing its exports. But he says the government is not eager to promote an industry that is concentrated in the eastern region of Santa Cruz, led by an administration that is in opposition to the central government.\nEconomy Minister Marcelo Montengro has pushed back against criticism, saying the current economic model of subsidies and a fixed exchange rate have contributed to \u201ca robust productive apparatus with price stability and low inflation.\u201d\nSocial protests, though, are on the rise. Public school teachers, for example, have been taking to the streets for six weeks, demanding more funding. The government has said it can\u2019t meet the demands at a time when it\u2019s facing lots of friendly fire amid public criticisms of Arce\u2019s management by his political mentor, former President Morales, who is also the head of the ruling Movement for Socialism.\n\u201cWe were coming out of the pandemic that plunged us into crisis, and I feel like we\u2019re sinking again just as the economy was recovering,\u201d said Sofia God\u00ednez, a 54-year-old homemaker.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press journalist Daniel Politi contributed from Buenos Aires, Argentina."

He failed each time as Bolivia\u2019s leftist ruling party, founded by former President Evo Morales, maintained a tight grip over politics.\nWhat\u2019s unexpected is that next month, after almost two decades of the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party in power, the candidate who promises to arrest Morales and cozy up to U.S. President Donald Trump stands a real chance of victory.\nPolls show Doria Medina, owner of hotel chains and Bolivia\u2019s Burger King restaurants, as a front-runner in the Aug. 17 election.\n\u201cNot only are we going to change the president, but the political cycle,\u201d Doria Medina, a former cement magnate, told The Associated Press Wednesday from his sleek office on the 20th floor of one of Bolivia\u2019s tallest towers that he helped build. \u201cPart of that change will be the emergence of new figures.\u201d\nLuring voters desperate for change\nDoria Medina, a successful businessman and entrepreneur, is tapping public outrage over Bolivia\u2019s worst economic crisis since 1991.\nHe promises unity to voters frustrated by the fracturing of the MAS party between current President Luis Arce and his erstwhile ally, the larger-than-life Morales, who oversaw a so-called economic miracle of rising growth and falling poverty for much of his tenure from 2006-2019.\nBut Morales\u2019 statist economic model, built on natural gas exports, has gone bust. Now the landlocked nation of 12 million is approaching a watershed moment as crippling dollar shortages, mass unrest and fuel scarcity threaten the once-unquestioned dominance of the MAS party founded in the 1990s.\n\u201cWe have a population that wants the economic conflict and lack of fuel to be solved,\u201d Doria Medina said.\nMuch remains uncertain in the run-up to the highly anticipated vote, with Morales\u2019 large base of loyalists vowing to leave their ballots blank on account of the former president\u2019s contentious exclusion from the race \u2014 in part a result of his bitter political fight with Arce.\nFacing a humiliating defeat, Arce dropped out of the race.\nThe only leftist candidate leading polls is Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez, the 36-year-old president of the senate and vice president of Morales\u2019 coca-farming union. Rodr\u00edguez would be considered the political heir of Morales\u2019 MAS if it weren\u2019t for Morales branding him a traitor for running against him.\nWith other opposition candidates further to the right, analysts see the moderate Doria Medina as best-positioned to win over traditional MAS party supporters as he promises to put the brakes on the foreign exchange rate and resolve fuel shortages within his first 100 days.\nThe value of a boliviano on the black market is now around half the official exchange rate.\n\u201cThis type of crisis has to be resolved very quickly,\u201d Doria Medina said, citing as a model the shock adjustment of radical libertarian President Javier Milei that drove down Argentina\u2019s double-digit inflation.\nPromising a \u2018shock\u2019 fiscal adjustment\nTo achieve such a swift transformation, Doria Medina told AP he would first scrap fuel subsidies, which have long been a politically sensitive pillar of the MAS party\u2019s economic policy. When Morales tried to eliminate the generous subsidies in 2010, mass nationwide riots forced him to backtrack.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest absurdity that in Bolivia it\u2019s $0.30 per liter of gasoline and in all neighboring countries it\u2019s $1,\u201d Doria Medina said, dismissing possible fallout from the move. Bolivia hemorrhaged $3 billion subsidizing gasoline and fuel last year.\nDoria Medina said his overhaul of subsidies and state-owned companies would accompany a major foreign policy shift after years of Bolivia aligning itself with China, Iran and Russia.\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re going to seek rapprochement with the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously going to try to have an agreement so that Bolivian products can reach the largest market in the world.\u201d\nArguably the biggest potential prize for the U.S. is Bolivia\u2019s large stockpiles of strategic minerals, including lithium, a key component of renewable batteries. Chinese and Russian companies have sought stakes in Bolivian lithium mines that remain largely undeveloped despite Morales\u2019 attempts and Arce\u2019s ambitions.\nThe end of an era for Morales\nAfter being run out of the presidential election and hit with an arrest warrant on charges related to his sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl, Morales remains holed up in his tropical stronghold. He says the allegations are politically motivated.\nDoria Medina was blunt when asked about the fate of Morales if he were to be elected.\n\u201cOne must comply with the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an award for his arrest. I\u2019m going to comply with the law.\u201d\nPressed on whether this meant prison time for Morales, he said yes, adding that he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Morales fled the country first \u2014 as he did in 2019, after resigning under military pressure in the wake of protests over his disputed reelection to an unprecedented fourth term.\nDoria Medina dismissed concerns over Morales\u2019 threats to \u201cconvulse the country\u201d in protest over the elections.\n\u201cEvo Morales no longer has that political strength. If he did, it would be something else,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI travel all over the country and people are upset. They\u2019re telling me they will vote to punish him.\u201d\n___\nDeBre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n____\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america"

(AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)\nLA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) \u2014 Renewed clashes rocked Bolivia\u2019s capital Wednesday as the woman who claimed the presidency, a second-tier lawmaker thrust into the post because of a power vacuum, faced challenges to her leadership from supporters of the ousted Evo Morales.\nA day after Jeanine A\u00f1ez assumed power, violent clashes broke out between rock-throwing Morales\u2019 backers and police in riot gear, who fired volleys of tear gas to disperse the large crowd of protesters as fighter jets flew low overhead in a show of force.\nOpposition was also building in Congress, where lawmakers loyal to Morales were mounting a challenge to A\u00f1ez\u2019s legitimacy by trying to hold new sessions that would undermine her claim to the presidency. The sessions \u2014 dismissed as invalid by A\u00f1ez\u2019s faction \u2014 added to the political uncertainty following the resignation of Morales, the nation\u2019s first indigenous leader, after nearly 14 years in power.\nIn the streets, angry demonstrators tore off corrugated sheets of metal and wooden planks from construction sites to use as weapons, and some set off sticks of dynamite. Many along flooded the streets of the capital and its sister city of El Alto, a Morales stronghold, waving the multicolored indigenous flag and chanting, \u201cNow, civil war!\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want any dictators. This lady has stepped on us \u2014 that\u2019s why we\u2019re so mad,\u201d said Paulina Luchampe. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight with our brothers and sisters until Evo Morales is back. We ask for his return. He needs to put the house in order.\u201d\nThe 60-year-old Morales, who arrived in Mexico on Tuesday under a grant of asylum, has vowed to remain active in politics and said he would be willing to go back home. \u201cIf the people ask me, we are willing to return,\u201d he said at news conference Wednesday in Mexico City.\nAccording to the constitution, an interim president has 90 days to organize an election, and the disputed accession of A\u00f1ez, who until Tuesday was second vice president of the Senate, was an example of the long list of obstacles she faces. Morales\u2019 backers, who hold a two-thirds majority in Congress, boycotted the session she called Tuesday night to formalize her claim to the presidency, preventing a quorum.\nShe claimed power anyway, saying the constitution did not specifically require congressional approval. \u201cMy commitment is to return democracy and tranquility to the country,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can never again steal our vote.\u201d\nBolivia\u2019s top constitutional court issued a statement late Tuesday laying out the legal justification for A\u00f1ez taking the presidency \u2014 without mentioning her by name.\nBut other legal experts challenged the legal technicalities that led to her claim, saying at least some of the steps required Congress to meet.\nThe lingering questions could affect her ability to govern.\nEduardo Gamarra, a Bolivian political scientist at Florida International University, said the constitution clearly states that A\u00f1ez didn\u2019t need a congressional vote to assume the presidency. Even so, \u201cthe next two months are going to be extraordinarily difficult for President A\u00f1ez,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem likely\u201d that Morales\u2019 party will accept A\u00f1ez as president, said Jennifer Cyr, an associate professor of political science and Latin American studies at the University of Arizona. \u201cSo the question of what happens next remains \u2014 still quite unclear and extremely worrying.\u201d\nShe will need to form a new electoral court, find non-partisan staff for the electoral tribunal and get Congress, which is controlled by Morales\u2019 Movement for Socialism Party, to vote on a new election.\nMorales resigned Sunday following weeks of violent protests fed by allegations of electoral fraud in the Oct. 20 election, which he claimed to have won. An Organization of American States audit reported widespread irregularities in the vote count and called for a new election.\nBut his resignation came only after Gen. Williams Kaliman, the armed forces commander, urged him to step down \u201cfor the good of Bolivia\u201d \u2014 a move that Morales and his backers have branded a coup d\u2019etat.\nTen people have died since the protests began, Bolivia\u2019s prosecutor office said Wednesday.\nA\u00f1ez swore in a new Cabinet as well as new commanders-in-chief for all branches of the military Wednesday, replacing Kaliman, who had been a Morales loyalist, with Gen. Carlos Orellana. The move was seen as an effort to build an alliance with the military, although it was uncertain how much support she could count on from other Bolivian power centers.\nStill, she received a boost of international support Wednesday.\nMichael G. Kozak of the U.S. State Department\u2019s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs welcomed her as \u201cinterim constitutional president,\u201d saying on Twitter: \u201cWe look forward to working with her & Bolivia\u2019s other civilian authorities as they arrange free & fair elections as soon as possible, in accordance w/ Bolivia\u2019s constitution.\u201d\nBrazil, which is one of Bolivia\u2019s top trading partners, also congratulated her on her \u201cconstitutional\u201d assumption of the presidency and her determination to work for peace and hold elections soon. Colombia and Guatemala also recognized her as interim president.\nWhile Argentine President Mauricio Macri had not commented on the issue, Argentine lawmakers in both houses of Congress condemned what they called a coup.\nA\u00f1ez said on Twitter that she has also reached out to Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 and asked him to send an ambassador to La Paz. The current ambassador reports to President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has rejected her claim to the presidency saying it lacked the necessary quorum.\nFrom the start, A\u00f1ez has tried to set herself apart from Morales. Wearing the presidential sash of office, she greeted supporters at an old presidential palace Tuesday night instead of the modern 26-story presidential office with a heliport that was built by Morales \u2014 a project his foes called one of his excesses.\nShe also carried a Bible, which had been banned by Morales from the presidential palace after he reformed the constitution and recognized the Andean earth deity Pachamama instead of the Roman Catholic Church.\nMorales, a one-time llama shepherd from the Bolivian highlands and former coca growers\u2019 union leader, helped lift millions out poverty as president, increasing social rights and presiding over stability and high economic growth in South America\u2019s poorest country.\nBut even many supporters eventually grew weary of his long tenure in power \u2014 as well as his insistence on running for a fourth term despite a public referendum that upheld term limits. Bolivia\u2019s high court, which critics contend was stacked in his favor, threw out the limits. A\u00f1ez said Wednesday she would seek to have the 2016 court ruling overturned to keep Morales from running in the next election.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Carlos Valdez and Natacha Pisarenko in La Paz, Debora Rey in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Mark Stevenson in Mexico City contributed to this report."

For Evo to come back!\u201d\nSecurity forces barricading a road to the court held them back. Police reported that the clashes between rock-throwing protesters and tear gas-lobbing police forces injured two officers, a journalist and a local merchant.\n\u201cThey\u2019re using firecrackers and rocks that are hurting our forces,\u201d said police Commander Juan Russo. \u201cThis is not a peaceful march.\u201d\nThe authorities did not report on any injuries among the protesters, who were seen being pushed onto the ground, shoved into police cars and blasted with tear gas. Morales had promised to attend the march Friday but did not show up.\nThe court\u2019s unanimous decision Wednesday upheld an earlier ruling that bans presidents from serving more than two terms. Morales has already served three, and, in 2019, resigned under pressure from the military and went into exile as protests erupted over his bid for an unprecedented fourth term.\nMorales returned to Bolivia a year later as the 2020 elections vaulted to power his preferred candidate, President Luis Arce, from his long-dominant Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party.\nArce, who announced earlier this week that he would not seek re-election, insisted that the Constitutional Court had disqualified Morales, his mentor-turned-rival, from running in 2025.\nBut many experts doubt the legitimacy of that decision in a country where political conflicts undermine the courts and presidents have maneuvered to get their allies on the bench.\n\u201cThe Constitutional Court issues unconstitutional arbitrary rulings at the whim of those in power,\u201d said Morales, who himself reaped the benefits of favorable judges while seeking to run for a fourth consecutive term in 2017.\nAfter Morales lost a referendum seeking to do away with term limits while still in power, the Constitutional Court ruled it would be against Morales\u2019 human rights to stop him from running for another term.\nThat 2017 ruling allows Morales to register his candidacy, said Oscar Hassentoufel, the president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. \u201cThen the tribunal will decide whether he\u2019s eligible or not.\u201d\nIn defiance of the latest court ruling, Morales called a mass march that marshaled his loyal supporters in the rural tropics. They long have championed the Indigenous coca-grower for transforming the country during his tenure \u2014 redistributing Bolivia\u2019s natural gas wealth and seeking greater inclusion for its Indigenous majority.\nAlthough he had earlier promised to participate, it appeared that Morales remained holed up in his stronghold for fear of arrest on human trafficking charges that he claims are politically motivated.\nThe government confirmed that fear Friday. \u201cWe ask Mr. Morales to surrender voluntarily,\u201d said Eduardo del Castillo, a key minister in Arce\u2019s government whom the MAS party endorsed for president later Friday in place of Arce. \u201cIf we find him walking the streets, we will arrest him.\u201d\nInstead, scores of his supporters walked the capital\u2019s streets on Friday wearing masks of Morales\u2019 face.\n\u201cEvo Morales is each and every one of us. If they want to detain Evo Morales they would need to take every one of us, too,\u201d said David Ochoa, a representative of the marchers."

The crisis deepened dramatically when the country\u2019s military chief went on national television to call on the president to step down.\n\u201cI am sending my resignation letter to the Legislative Assembly of Bolivia,\u201d the 60-year-old socialist leader said, portraying his departure as the culmination of a \u201ccoup d\u2019etat.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI ask you to stop attacking the brothers and sisters, stop burning and attacking.\u201d\nBefore Morales had even finished his statement, people began honking their car horns in La Paz and other cities and took to the streets to celebrate, waving Bolivian flags and setting off fireworks.\n\u201cThis is not Cuba, nor Venezuela. This is Bolivia, and Bolivia is respected,\u201d a crowd in the capital shouted.\nLarge crowds formed in the main squares in the capital, with many people rejoicing and some crying tears of joy. Protesters lay down in front of the presidential palace and set a coffin on fire to symbolize the death of the Morales government.\n\u201cWe are celebrating that Bolivia is free,\u201d said one demonstrator near the presidential palace.\nIt was not immediately clear who would succeed Morales. His vice president also resigned as did the Senate president, who was next in line. The only other official listed by the constitution as a successor, the head of the lower house, already had resigned.\nMorales was the first member of Bolivia\u2019s indigenous population to become president and was in power for 13 years and nine months, the longest span in the country\u2019s history.\nBut his claim to have won a fourth term last month set off unrest that left three people dead and over 100 injured in clashes between his supporters and opponents.\nAfter nightfall, there were reports of tensions in La Paz and the neighboring city of El Alto, with reports of looting and burning of public property and some houses.\nEarlier Sunday, the Organization of American States said in a preliminary report that it had found a \u201cheap of observed irregularities\u201d in the Oct. 20 election and that a new vote should be held.\nMorales agreed to that. But within hours, the military chief, Gen. Williams Kaliman, made it clear that would not be sufficient.\n\u201cAfter analyzing the situation of internal conflict, we ask the president to resign, allowing peace to be restored and stability to be maintained for the good of our Bolivia,\u201d Kaliman said.\nThe leadership crisis escalated in the hours leading up Morales\u2019 resignation. Two government ministers in charge of mines and hydrocarbons, the Chamber of Deputies president and three other pro-government legislators announced their resignations. Some said opposition supporters had threatened their families.\nIn addition, the head of Bolivia\u2019s Supreme Electoral Tribunal, Maria Eugenia Choque, stepped down after the release of the OAS findings. The attorney general\u2019s office said it would investigate the tribunal\u2019s judges for possible fraud, and police later said Choque had been detained along with 37 other officials on suspicion of electoral crimes.\nMorales, whose whereabouts were unknown, went on Twitter late Sunday to claim authorities were seeking to arrest him, but police Gen. Yuri Calderon denied any apprehension order had been issued for the resigned leader. He called such rumors \u201cfake news.\u201d\nIn his tweet, Morales said: \u201cI report to the world and Bolivian people that a police officer publicly announced that he has instructions to execute an unlawful apprehension order against me; in addition, violent groups also stormed my home.\u201d\nArmed intruders did break into Morales\u2019 home in Cochabamba.\nMexico\u2019s government reported Sunday night that 20 members of Bolivia\u2019s executive and legislative branches were at the official Mexican residence in the capital seeking asylum.\nMexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard also said on Twitter that Mexico would offer asylum to Morales if should ask for it. There was no indication that Morales had done that.\nEarlier, Ebrard criticized the involvement of the Bolivian military in the day\u2019s events crisis, saying that \u201cwe reject it.\u201d\nIn a tweet, Ebrard said: \u201cMexico will maintain its position of respect for democracy and institutions. Coup no.\u201d\nJennifer Cyr, an associate professor of political science and Latin American studies at the University of Arizona, also voiced concern about the military commander calling on Morales to resign, calling it \u201cextremely troubling\u201d and \u201csad.\u201d\nThe OAS report and Morales\u2019 acceptance of a new election were positive steps that could have calmed Bolivia\u2019s divisions, she said. \u201cNow I am not sure what will happen.\u201d\nMorales was first elected in 2006 and went on to preside over a commodities-fed economic boom in South America\u2019s poorest country. The combative former leader of a coca growers union, he paved roads, sent Bolivia\u2019s first satellite into space and curbed inflation.\nBut many who were once excited by his fairy-tale rise grew wary of his reluctance to leave power.\nHe ran for a fourth term after refusing to abide by the results of a referendum that upheld term limits for the president. He was able to run because Bolivia\u2019s constitutional court disallowed such limits.\nAfter the Oct. 20 vote, Morales declared himself the outright winner even before official results indicated he obtained just enough support to avoid a runoff with opposition leader and former President Carlos Mesa. A 24-hour lapse in releasing results fueled suspicions of vote-rigging.\nThe OAS sent a team to look into the election. It called for a new contest with a new electoral tribunal.\n\u201cMindful of the heap of observed irregularities, it\u2019s not possible to guarantee the integrity of the numbers and give certainty of the results,\u201d the OAS said in a statement.\nThe U.S. State Department issued a statement calling for the OAS to send a mission to Bolivia to oversee the electoral process. \u201cThe Bolivian people deserve free and fair elections,\u201d it said.\nDuring the unrest, protesters torched the headquarters of local electoral tribunal offices and set up roadblocks that paralyzed parts of Bolivia.\nThe pressure on Morales had increased ominously Saturday when police on guard outside the presidential palace abandoned their posts, and police officers retreated to their barracks in at least three cities.\nThe state news agency ABI said Morales announced his resignation from Chapare province, where he began his career as a union leader. At the end of his speech, he said he was returning to Chapare.\n\u201cI return to my people who never left me. The fight goes on,\u201d he said.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Luis Andres Henao in Buenos Aires, Argentina, contributed to this report."

      "text": "Bolivia\u2019s president promises public votes on fuel subsidies and constitutionality of reelection\nLA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) \u2014 Bolivia\u2019s socialist President Luis Arce said Tuesday national referenda would be held soon on the removal of politically combustible fuel subsidies and on the constitutionality of presidential reelections, offering for the first time a concrete path out of the country\u2019s economic morass and political limbo.\nArce did not give a date for the votes in his speech from Sucre, the southern historical capital, as Bolivia marked the 199th anniversary of its independence. He defended the referenda proposal as a way to dispel some of the uncertainty Bolivians have endured for months, promising that the populist gesture wasn\u2019t about \u201celectoral calculations or personal ambitions.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the people, together with their government, to choose the path we wish to follow in view of the bicentennial,\u201d Arce said.\nA plan to vote on the elimination of fuel subsidies comes as incensed truckers and other protesters have blockaded roads leading to Bolivian cities in recent weeks over the scarcity of diesel, which is more than 80% imported. Fuel shipments from Bolivia\u2019s key ally Russia were stranded by a rainstorm last week at a Chilean port, adding to pressures on Arce\u2019s administration.\nThe government has nearly gone bankrupt importing and heavily subsidizing fuel. Bolivia would need $10 million a day to keep importing gasoline at international prices, selling it at half the price and remaining solvent, energy analyst Raul Velasquez said.\nWithout exporting natural gas anymore \u2014 once the mainstay of its booming economy \u2014 Bolivia is burning through its foreign currency reserves.\nBut curtailing the long-established subsidies risks triggering catastrophic price shocks \u2014 and further inflaming outrage among Bolivians already beset with economic woes.\nThe official exchange rate between the boliviano and the U.S. dollar has effectively collapsed. The black market rate has surged 50% above the official one. In his speech, Arce also said he would convene business leaders for discussions on whether to devalue the local currency.\nArce also announced a referendum on whether and how former presidents may seek reelection, an apparent attempt to resolve a dispute with powerful former President Evo Morales.\nArce\u2019s erstwhile mentor and ally, Morales has declared his intent to run against Arce in 2025 presidential elections \u2014 which Arce insists is unconstitutional.\nStanding for more than two consecutive terms is prohibited under Bolivian law. But Morales managed to serve three terms as president, from 2006-2019, because of a legal loophole.\nMorales\u2019 bid for a fourth term \u2014 which the constitutional court actually allowed at the time even though he lost a referendum on extending term limits \u2014 prompted allegations of fraud and unleashed mass unrest that compelled the leftist leader to resign and flee the country in 2019.\nMorales\u2019 power struggle with Arce since returning home to Bolivia and launching a comeback has created a rolling political crisis that has paralyzed the country\u2019s Congress, sunk plans to lure foreign investors to tap Bolivia\u2019s vast lithium reserves and blocked the government from taking on foreign debt that would alleviate the cash crunch.\n\u201cTo ensure that political actors do not once again affect the stability and economy of Bolivian families, it\u2019s important to clarify the nature of reelection,\u201d Arce said, without giving further details about the public vote. It wasn\u2019t clear whether the referendum would involve changing the constitution ahead of next year\u2019s elections.\nAlthough Independence Day speeches may typically offer leaders a chance to reflect on the year\u2019s political accomplishments, President Arce took the occasion to detail his many woes: Bolivia\u2019s fall in natural gas production, legislative gridlock, foreign currency shortage \u2014 even, he said, \u201cthe climate crisis.\u201d\nHis critics showed little pity.\n\u201cThe president again blames Congress for the country\u2019s crisis and avoids assuming responsibilities,\u201d opposition lawmaker Jairo Quinteros said.\nBolivia\u2019s anniversary comes just over 40 days after an alleged botched military coup brought the country to a standstill.\nIt remains unclear what exactly transpired on June 26 when General Juan Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga stormed the government headquarters surrounded by military vehicles and briefly faced down Arce before being dismissed and arrested, his alleged overthrow plot vanquished.\nArce \u2014 who has denied an eruption of allegations that he masterminded the coup to boost his own political fortunes \u2014 shed no more light on the matter Tuesday.\nWhat has become clearer, analysts say, is that Bolivia\u2019s economic and political crisis has only worsened.\nThe sight of tanks ramming into the presidential palace last month didn\u2019t quite help restore investor confidence. And amid the Independence Day festivities, trucks and buses idled for hours outside gas stations as the much-anticipated Russian fuel delivered last week failed to relieve the dire shortages.\nFew expect the promise of a referendum to solve the country\u2019s problems.\n\u201cArce has opted to get rid of his problems, to pass the hot potato onto others by asking the people to find the solution,\u201d prominent Bolivian political analyst Jos\u00e9 Luis Bedregal said. \u201cA new scenario has opened that will further complicate the political debate.\u201d\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s regional coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america"

      "text": "Bolivia\u2019s President Arce, polls slipping, quits 2025 presidential race\nLA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) \u2014 Facing the prospect of a humiliating defeat in Bolivia\u2019s presidential election in August, President Luis Arce, who assumed office in 2020 and was expected to seek a second term, said Tuesday he would withdraw from the race.\nThe decision, announced in a lengthy late-night televised address, comes as a rift deepens at the top of Bolivia\u2019s governing party, where Arce and his erstwhile ally, former President Evo Morales, struggle for control of their leftist bloc.\n\u201cI will not be a factor in dividing the popular vote,\u201d Arce said in his speech, warning that a fragmented base would give Bolivia\u2019s right-wing and centrist parties a shot at power after nearly two decades of socialist rule. \u201cMuch less will I facilitate the realization of a fascist right-wing project ... that seeks to destroy the productive social economic model.\u201d\nThe yearslong rivalry between Arce and Morales has been accelerating a slow-burning economic crisis that has working-class voters, who are the core constituency of MAS, up in arms.\nBolivia has gone from exporting natural gas to importing fuel and from boasting one of the region\u2019s lowest inflation rates to struggling with one of its highest. The value of Bolivia\u2019s local currency on the black market is now half the official exchange rate. Fuel shortages paralyze the country. The central bank has effectively run out of dollars.\nMany of these problems took root under Arce\u2019s iconic predecessor, Morales, but the majority of voters blame Arce for the economic chaos. Polls indicate that the embattled president has been falling further and further behind his left-wing rivals \u2014 Morales and Senate President Andronico Rodr\u00edguez.\nWith the MAS under Arce\u2019s control, Morales was forced to break away and create his own party to host his candidacy.\nIt\u2019s still unclear whether Rodr\u00edguez, a politically savvy 36-year-old from Morales\u2019 rural coca-growing stronghold, will join the MAS ticket or register with another party. The registration deadline is May 19.\nArce\u2019s decision to drop out Tuesday was also seen as a new chapter in his increasingly bitter enmity with Morales, whose renewed campaign pitch plays on nostalgia for the commodities-fueled public investment and falling poverty that characterized much of his almost 14-year tenure, from 2006 to 2019.\n\u201cI challenge former President Evo Morales not to insist on running,\u201d Arce said, \u201cbecause constitutionally he cannot do so and because the dispersion and fragmentation of the vote would favor the right.\u201d\nMorales, Bolivia\u2019s first Indigenous president, faces numerous obstacles on the road back to his country\u2019s highest office, six years after his bid for an unconstitutional fourth term led to mass protests and self-exile under pressure from the military.\nArce\u2019s government insists that a 2023 constitutional court ruling bars Morales from seeking another term. Ever since a judge ordered Morales\u2019 arrest on charges linked to a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl \u2014 allegations that he says are politically motivated \u2014 the ex-leader has been hunkered down in a remote tropical corner of Bolivia, protected by legions of fiercely loyal supporters.\nArce appealed to Rodr\u00edguez to rally their fractured socialist base against the opposition, leading some analysts to suggest the young, previously little-known politician may emerge as the most likely left-wing candidate.\n\u201cThe biggest winner is Rodr\u00edguez if Morales accepts Arce\u2019s challenge to abandon his aspirations,\u201d said Bolivian political analyst Marcelo Arequipa. \u201cThe (MAS party\u2019s) decision is between losing power or remaining in power. Which do they prefer?\u201d\nThere are at least four opposition candidates but no clear front-runner, paving the way for a tumultuous campaign season ahead of the August 17 election."
