  "description": "Ghost Adventures star Aaron Goodwin\u2019s ex, locked up for attempting to have him killed, said she was hopeful for a reconciliation, Us Weekly can exclusively report",
  "content": "Ghost Adventures star Aaron Goodwin\u2019s estranged wife, Victoria Goodwin, is hopeful that they can get back together only months after she was sentenced in a murder-for-hire plot to kill him, Us Weekly can exclusively report.\n\nOn August 1, Victoria, 32, who is currently serving a three to seven-year sentence in a Nevada prison, responded to Aaron\u2019s petition for divorce. In his petition, which was filed earlier this year, Aaron stated that \u201ctastes, likes and dislikes of husband and wife have become incompatible to the extent that it has become impossible for them to live together as husband and wife in marital harmony. That there is no possibility of reconciliation between husband and wife.\u201d\n\nVictoria\u2019s response, filed August 1, reads: \u201cWhile [Victoria] admits said paragraph, [she] believes the parties can reconcile.\u201d\n\nVictoria isn\u2019t trying to stop the divorce, however. She laid out her asks in the docs, including a counterclaim, demanding Aaron, 49, pay her monthly alimony, return personal property allegedly in his possession and pay her legal fees. In addition, Victoria also requested that she keep her married last name, which is Goodwin.\n\nThe exes wed on May 4, 2020. Victoria was taken into custody in March after she was accused of communicating with a Florida inmate named Grant Amato about hiring a third party to kill Aaron. TMZ reported that Amato was sentenced to life for killing his father, mother and brother inside their home.\n\nProsecutors obtained an alleged text from Victoria to Amato, 36, which read, \u201cAm I a bad person? Because I chose to end his existence. Not divorce.\u201d The duo talked about paying $11,000 to hire a hitman. The messages indicated Victoria and the inmate were in \u201clove\u201d with each other.\n\nVictoria pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder following a plea deal being reached. The prosecutors dropped the solicitation to commit murder charge. Aaron filed for divorce a couple of days after Victoria\u2019s arrest. He requested that neither party be awarded spousal support.\n\nIn an amended petition, Aaron demanded punitive damages against Victoria. He accused her of negligence, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\n\u201c[Victoria\u2019s] conduct was extreme or outrageous with either the intention of, or reckless disregard for, causing emotional distress to [Aaron],\u201d his petition read.\n\n\u201c[Victoria] acted, intending to confine [Aaron] within boundaries fixed by [Victoria]. [Victoria\u2019s] act directly or resulted in such a confinement of [Aaron] and [Aaron] was conscious of the confinement or was harmed by it,\u201d Aaron\u2019s lawyer wrote to explain the false imprisonment allegation.\n\nAaron demanded tens of thousands in damages and for Victoria to pay his legal bills.\n\nOn June 5, Victoria was sentenced in the case. Aaron gave a victim statement in court.\n\n\u201cShe made me feel so [much] more special,\u201d he told the court. \u201cNow, discovering she put a hit out to kill me more than once, got blackmailed and spent almost all our savings to keep it quiet, and [she] fell more in love with [Grant] Amato. They even got spiritually married, and now I was called \u2018the first husband.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe reality star said he \u201cfeared for his life\u201d due to Victoria\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve hired secure, armed security for weeks, not knowing it was over or not a lot, always looking over my shoulder and having to go through therapy and even trying to understand any of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a heartbreak no one should go through in life. I can\u2019t trust anything anymore. I cry every day. I feel so alone.\u201d\n\nThe TV star added, \u201cI thought whether she got minimum or maximum time, I still won\u2019t feel safe whenever she\u2019s released. I feel like this deserves prison time.\u201d",

The pair engaged in a subsequent affair, which led to the band breaking up and Joel battling a severe depression that included two suicide attempts. (The affair and its aftermath were discussed in the two-part HBO documentary Billy Joel: And So It Goes, which premiered in July.)\nThe pair later reconnected after Weber\u2019s divorce and married in 1973, going on to spend nearly 10 years together before ending their marriage in 1982. Joel went on to marry Christie Brinkley in 1985, welcoming daughter Alexa Ray Joel before calling it quits in 1994. Joel then married cookbook author Katie Lee in 2004 \u2014 the pair divorced five years later in 2009. In 2015, Joel married Alex Roderick. The pair share two children, Della Rose Joel and Remy Anne Joel.\nWeber, for her part, shares a son, Sean Weber-Small, with her first husband.\nWhile speaking with Us, Weber said that her son and her grandchildren also know and are even somewhat close to Joel.\n\u201cI have my grandchildren that he knows and they know him,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy granddaughter Ella taught Bill what TikTok was and showed him what was happening. And his relationship with Sean is important to both of them.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cSo, we\u2019re not distant but we\u2019re, you know, and he lives in Florida and I live in California. But it\u2019s all good. \u201c\nWeber said that her son Sean and Joel \u201cwere very close,\u201d adding that during their marriage the three \u201clived on top of the mountain.\u201d\n\u201cWe entertained each other,\u201d she explained. \u201cBill and I worked all day long and the whole writing process was never done \u2014 in the years that Bill and I were together \u2014 was never done remotely or in [a] studio. It happened in our living room, and Sean was an integral part.\u201d\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available. Call or text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org."

      "text": "The Ghost Adventures cast and crew were surprised by Aaron Goodwin\u2019s divorce from Victoria Goodwin following her arrest.\n\u201cThe rest of the cast was shocked by the news. No one knew anything was wrong in their relationship,\u201d a source exclusively tells Us Weekly. \u201cEveryone who works on the show can\u2019t believe this is happening. They are all currently in a state of shock.\u201d\nIn addition to Aaron, the paranormal investigation series stars Zak Bagans, Billy Tolley and Jay Wasley. Aaron, 48, and Bagans, 47, have been leading the show since its 2008 premiere. Tolley, 52, and Walsey worked behind the scenes before joining the main cast in 2012 and 2014, respectively.\nWhile filming for Ghost Adventures\u2019 upcoming season \u201crecently wrapped up,\u201d the team is rallying behind Aaron. According to the insider, the group is \u201ctrying to be supportive of Aaron by reaching out and offering to help in any way they can.\u201d\n\u201cThe cast and producers are all a tight knit group,\u201d the source adds.\nUs exclusively revealed on Thursday, March 13, that Aaron filed for divorce from Victoria, 32. According to the filing, the pair wed on May 4, 2020, the date Aaron previously shared was supposed to be the day of the wedding ceremony which was pushed back two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe paperwork also stated there was no chance for a reconciliation between the twosome.\n\u201cThe views, tastes, likes and dislikes of husband and wife have become incompatible to the extent that it has become impossible for them to live together \u2026 in marital harmony,\u201d the docs read. \u201cThere is no possibility of reconciliation.\u201d\nThe news of the pair\u2019s divorce comes days after Victoria was arrested on charges of soliciting to commit murder and conspiring to commit murder. Victoria was held on $100,000 bail. (TMZ was the first to report the news on Monday, March 10.)\nAccording to police reports obtained by Us, Victoria had been in contact with a prison inmate in Florida named Grant Amato about wanting to leave her and Aaron\u2019s marriage. Instead of seeking a legal way to end the relationship, Victoria allegedly sought out a hitman. One of her alleged text messages read, \u201cAm I a bad person? Because I chose to end his existence. Not divorce.\u201d\nIn October 2024, Victoria allegedly shared information about Aaron\u2019s whereabouts while he was away filming Ghost Adventures in California. She allegedly agreed to pay Amato $11,515 and had spoken about a $2,500 upfront payment.\n\u201cHe\u2019s asleep right now in the hotel room \u2026 I need to know what\u2019s going on. Can I get an update. Was it done?\u201d another alleged text read.\nLaw enforcement learned of the alleged murder plot when they seized Amato\u2019s phone at the prison. Victoria has denied wanting to have her husband killed and claimed that she didn\u2019t remember sending those messages, per the arrest report.\nWith reporting by Travis Cronin"

      "text": "Game of Thrones wrapped up its eight-season run in 2019, and there have been a few contenders to be the next GoT, including the prequel series House of the Dragon.\nHowever, Amazon Prime Video\u2018s upcoming miniseries King & Conqueror is giving off some serious Game of Thrones vibes, and there isn\u2019t a dragon in sight.\nThis story is based on the conflict between Harold Godwinson and William the Conqueror in 1066 for the throne of England.\nWhile only a few previews have been released so far, Watch With Us is sharing three reasons to watch King & Conqueror when it debuts on Prime Video later this year.\nThe \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Connection\nIf you thought William the Conqueror looked familiar in the trailer, you\u2019re not wrong. Game of Thrones\u2018 Nikolaj Coster-Waldau \u2014 who portrayed Jaime Lannister on the series \u2014 is playing William on this show. William is a vastly different character from the one that Coster-Waldau played for eight seasons, but the actor just seems to fit in well within a medieval setting.\nJames Norton is also leading the cast as William\u2019s rival, Harold Godwinson. The rest of the performers include several veteran British actors, including Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy, Emily Beecham, Luther Ford and Eddie Marsan. They may not be household names in America, but that\u2019s a solid cast by any standard.\n\u2018King & Conqueror\u2019 Looks Like It Has High Production Values\nAdmittedly, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of trailers from King & Conqueror yet, so our impressions may change. But even from the early look at the show, it looks like a big budget was spent to bring this show to life in a convincing way.\nEverything from the costumes to the battle scenes suggests that King & Conqueror is going all-out with its production. It may not hit on the same level as last year\u2019s incredible Shogun adaptation, but it seems very promising for now.\nThe Series Will Tackle One of the Most Famous Battles in History\nUnless you\u2019re a student of history, you may not be familiar with the Battle of Hastings. Nearly a thousand years later, that battle is still considered to be one of the bloodiest encounters in English history. William and Harold\u2019s forces met on the battlefield, and the winner went on to rule the country and consolidate their power.\nHistorical details about what happened at the Battle of Hastings are incomplete, and there are also conflicting accounts. So there will probably be some creative liberties taken with it. But we do know how it ends, and it should be entertaining to see this fight play out.\nKing & Conqueror will premiere on Prime Video later this year."

Sentenced in Nevada\n\"Ghost Adventures\" star Aaron Goodwin\u2019s wife just got her fate sealed -- she\u2019s been officially sentenced for plotting to have him murdered.\nVictoria Goodwin\u2019s been sentenced to a minimum of 3 years to 7.5 years in a Nevada prison, with 92 days of time already served knocked off the clock. This all comes after she copped a plea deal to dodge a full-blown murder-for-hire trial.\nThursday\u2019s emotional courtroom showdown had Victoria apologizing directly to Aaron for the chaos, heartbreak, and danger she put him through ... swearing she\u2019ll never forgive herself for the \"stupid\" choices that got her here.\nAaron broke down while reliving the nightmare -- saying Victoria\u2019s twisted murder-for-hire plot shattered his trust, destroyed his peace, and left him living with armed security. He told the judge he\u2019ll never truly feel safe ... no matter how long she\u2019s locked up.\nAs we first told you ... Victoria pled guilty back in April to conspiracy to commit murder -- after allegedly plotting to have Aaron killed, complete with disturbing play-by-play updates, per prosecutors.\nAccording to court docs, she struck a deal -- admitting to the conspiracy charge so prosecutors would drop the solicitation to commit murder count.\nTMZ broke the story ... Victoria was busted in March after cops say she was messaging Florida inmate Grant Amato, plotting Aaron\u2019s murder -- even giving him filming details for a \"Ghost Adventures\" shoot with Zak Bagans.\nAaron didn\u2019t waste time -- he filed for divorce just days after her arrest."

      "text": "New details surrounding the drowning death of Emilie and Brady Kiser\u2019s son Trigg, 3, have emerged following the release of the redacted police report.\nThe documents, obtained by Us Weekly on Friday, August 8, detail the events that led up to Trigg\u2019s death on May 18 after he was pulled unconscious from a pool at the influencer\u2019s home in Arizona.\nAlthough details of the security footage were redacted, the Chandler Police Report noted there were discrepancies between what the footage showed and Brady\u2019s initial recollection of events. The report also noted that the pool was unsecured at the time of the incident and that the toddler was not adequately supervised while outside playing near the uncovered pool and did not know how to swim.\nThe police report noted that Trigg had exited the home without being accompanied by a supervising adult and Brady was \u201caware\u201d that his son was playing outside alone.\nAccording to the report, Brady, 28, told officers at the scene who arrived after he called 911 that Trigg had been out of his sight for around \u201cthree minutes\u201d or \u201cfive minutes\u201d before he saw him in the pool and immediately jumped in to pull him out.\nPer Brady\u2019s statement, he told an officer, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a clock, obviously, I don\u2019t know the exact time, but it was moments, it wasn\u2019t minutes, it was moments, it wasn\u2019t that he\u2019d been out of sight for long.\u201d\nHowever, the police report also noted that the security footage did not appear to line up with Brady\u2019s versions of events. Discrepancies included how long Trigg was outside before Brady checked on him and Brady reporting instances that did not occur on the surveillance camera such as saying he saw Trigg \u201cplaying on the grass.\u201d Due to this, a second interview with Brady was undertaken.\nFollowing the second interview with Brady, the report concluded, \u201cThis tragic incident was the result of [Trigg] being in the backyard unsupervised while playing around the unsecured pool and unable to swim. It is clear from the video that he did not go into the water intentionally, rather he tripped and fell in while playing with an inflatable chair.\u201d\nThe Chandler Police Department conclusion continued: \u201c[Redacted] was in the backyard from 18:29:42 hours until Brady found him in the pool at 18:39:00 hours. He was in the water from 18:32:15 until 18:39:07. It is clear Brady\u2019s attention was divided, and he was not watching at all during the critical times mentioned. During two interviews he did not know what was doing before he fell in and did not see [redacted] struggling to swim.\u201d\nIn other statements to the Chandler Police Department, both Brady and Emilie, 26, noted that Trigg had limited swimming skills.\nBrady told police that Trigg had taken some lessons and \u201cknows how to kick his feet and swing his arms\u2026but he\u2019s not proficient.\u201d He added that his son \u201cknows not to go in the water without us.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Emilie also confirmed Trigg had taken some lessons but \u201cdidn\u2019t fully know how to swim.\u201d She added he knew \u201chow to swim to us and he knew how to climb the wall, but where he fell in there was no wall.\u201d\nThe documents also noted that there was no cover securing the pool at the time of the incident. Brady and Emilie both noted they usually use a \u201cKatchakid\u201d safety net, but this was not in place at the time of the incident. In addition, the documents noted there were four access doors to the backyard and the alarm systems did not sound on any of them, none were self-closing and one appeared to be malfunctioning.\nThe Chandler Police Department also included its reasons for submitting the case to Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office for a review into child abuse with criminal negligence claims.\n\u201cThis conclusion is based on several factors. Brady knew the pool net was not on the pool. He knew [redacted] was in the backyard and didn\u2019t know how to swim. According to video evidence, [redacted] was in the backyard unsupervised for more than nine minutes, and in the water for about seven of those minutes,\u201d the report read. \u201cBrady\u2019s statements do not match what is seen on the video; he did not accurately describe one thing did after he went outside. This leads to the conclusion that Brady was not aware of what was doing and was not watching him. The combination of these factors led to drowning, and a remedy to any of the contributing circumstances could have prevented the outcome.\u201d\nThe Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office released a statement on July 25, announcing Brady will not face child abuse charges due to there being \u201cno likelihood of conviction\u201d following review of the evidence.\n\u201cEvery case submitted to the Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office is evaluated using the same standard: whether there is a \u2018reasonable likelihood of conviction,\u2019\u201d the statement continued. \u201cAfter careful review of the evidence submitted by Chandler PD, it was determined this case does not meet that standard. MCAO\u2019s review of the case involved the attorneys assigned to it, along with highly experienced senior attorneys and the County Attorney herself.\u201d\nBrady\u2019s attorney Flynn Carey responded to the update in the case via a statement shared with multiple outlets at the time.\n\u201cWe are grateful to law enforcement and the county attorney for conducting a thorough investigation and confirming that this was a tragic accident,\u201d the statement read.\u201cBrady remains in the midst of the grieving process and is thankful to be with his family as they heal together. We appreciate the compassion and support shown during this difficult time.\u201d"

      "text": "The official cause of death for Kelly Clarkson\u2019s ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock, has been confirmed.\nSilver Bow County Coroner Dan Hollis told Us Weekly on Monday, August 11, that Blackstock\u2019s cause of death was melanoma, a form of skin cancer, and the manner of his death was natural causes. \u201cBrandon Blackstock passed away peacefully at his home in Butte, Montana on August 7th under hospice care surrounded by his family,\u201d Hollis said in a statement.\nBlackstock died on August 7 after privately battling cancer for three years. He was 48.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d a family rep told Us in a statement. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nOne day earlier, Clarkson, 43, alerted fans to Blackstock\u2019s illness when she put her Las Vegas residency on pause, though she didn\u2019t reveal the nature of his condition at the time.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,\u201d she announced via Instagram on August 6. \u201cWhile I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children\u2019s father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them. I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.\u201d\nClarkson and Blackstock wed in October 2013 and went on to welcome daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9. During their marriage, Blackstock worked as the singer\u2019s manager. Clarkson ultimately filed for divorce in June 2020 after nearly seven years. The pair finalized the proceedings in March 2022 following a messy legal battle.\nPrior to his relationship with Clarkson, Blackstock was married to Melissa Ashworth from 2001 to 2012. The exes shared daughter Savannah, 23, and son Seth, 18.\nIn January 2022, Blackstock became a first-time grandfather when Savannah gave birth to her and now-husband Quentin Lee\u2019s son, Lake. Savannah announced in July that the couple are expecting their second baby.\nOutside of his marriage to Clarkson, Brandon had another Hollywood connection via his father, Narvel Blackstock, who was Clarkson\u2019s manager earlier in her career. Narvel was previously married to Reba McEntire from 1989 to 2015, during which time she was stepmom to Brandon and his two sisters, Chassidy and Shawna. Narvel and McEntire\u2019s son, Shelby, who was born in 1990, was Brandon\u2019s half-brother."

      "text": "Ghost Adventures star Aaron Goodwin has filed for divorce from wife Victoria Goodwin amid allegations that she hired a hitman to kill him.\nAaron, 48, filed for divorce in Clark County, Nevada, on Wednesday, March 12, per records viewed by Us Weekly exclusively. In the filing, Aaron seeks to maintain his separate property and have their community assets divided equally. However, he does want to have the costs of the community assets reimbursed. He is also seeking to have his single status restored.\n\u201cThe views, tastes, likes and dislikes of husband and wife have become incompatible to the extent that it has become impossible for them to live together \u2026 in marital harmony,\u201d the docs read. \u201cThere is no possibility of reconciliation.\u201d\nAaron is also requesting that alimony not be rewarded to either him or Victoria, 32.\nIn the docs, Aaron listed the pair\u2019s wedding date as May 4, 2020 \u2014 the day the pair were initially scheduled to walk down the aisle which was then postponed for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, per his Instagram post that day.\nWhen contacted by Us Weekly, Aaron\u2019s attorney said he could not comment on pending litigation.\nThe filing came six days after Victoria\u2019s March 6 arrest on charges of soliciting to commit murder and conspiring to commit murder. Victoria was held on $100,000 bail.\nAccording to police reports obtained by Us, Victoria had been communicating with a Florida prison inmate named Grant Amato about wanting to leave her marriage. One of her alleged text messages read, \u201cAm I a bad person? Because I chose to end his existence. Not divorce.\u201d (TMZ was the first to report the news on Monday, March 10.)\nAn arrest report claimed that Victoria, who has been married to Aaron for nearly three years, shared information about his whereabouts while filming Ghost Adventures in California. She allegedly allotted $11,515 to pay Amato in October 2024 and had spoken about a $2,500 upfront payment.\n\u201cHe\u2019s asleep right now in the hotel room \u2026 I need to know what\u2019s going on. Can I get an update. Was it done?\u201d another alleged text read.\nThe police caught wind of the alleged murder plot after corrections officers found and seized the inmate\u2019s phone at the Florida prison. Per the arrest report, Victoria denied wanting to have her husband killed and claimed that she didn\u2019t remember sending those messages.\nWhen questioned by the police about her correspondences and the funds, Victoria allegedly admitted that she and Aaron were struggling in their marriage and said she believed the money would be traded for cell phones.\nAccording to TMZ, Aaron was reportedly blindsided by the news and thought that he and Victoria had a solid marriage. One week before her arrest, Victoria shared a cozy photo of the couple cuddling with their cat.\nAaron and Victoria exchanged vows at Disneyland in August 2022 after delaying their ceremony, which was initially set for May 2020. \u201cIt finally happened \ud83d\udc8d we got married,\u201d Aaron wrote via Instagram at the time. \u201cAfter postponing many times due to Covid we got our day. I couldn\u2019t be happier \u2764\ufe0f.\u201d"

      "text": "Aaron Goodwin and estranged wife Victoria Goodwin came face-to-face in court as she was sentenced following a murder-for-hire plot to allegedly kill the Ghost Adventures star.\nVictoria, 32, spoke directly to Aaron, 49, on Thursday, June 5, apologizing for her actions.\n\u201cFirstly, and most importantly, I would like to apologize to Aaron. I\u2019m so immensely sorry for the pain and anxiety I\u2019ve caused you and the betrayal you undoubtedly and rightfully feel by my actions,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cI need you to know that I will always hold love for you. I genuinely pray you find your joy and peace again, and I will bow out of your life forever to hopefully ease that process. I\u2019m sorry I broke us, and I\u2019m consumed with regret every day. My absolute promise to you is that you\u2019ll never see or hear from me.\u201d\nShe shared her intent to \u201cleave the state of Nevada\u201d so that he \u201cwill never be in danger\u201d of her again.\n\u201cSecondly, I\u2019d like to apologize to my parents. My actions are not a reflection of how you raised me with unwavering love and support, and I know I\u2019m better than this,\u201d she continued. \u201cNext, I\u2019d like to apologize to the court. I recognize and understand my stupidity, the terrible nature of my crime against Aaron, my regrettable choices and monumental lapse in judgment. This is my rock bottom, and I\u2019ll never forgive myself.\u201d\nVictoria was arrested in Nevada this past March on charges of soliciting to commit murder and conspiring to commit murder. She previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder. She was sentenced to a minimum of 36 months to a maximum of 90 months on Thursday.\n\u201cPrior to my arrest, I was taking steps toward mending my marriage and correcting my mistakes that led me here. Now, having spent 92 days in jail, I\u2019ve had plenty of time to reflect on my foolishness, and I\u2019m that much more committed to never getting in trouble again and doing better in every aspect of my life, especially with my mental health,\u201d Victoria\u2019s statement continued. \u201cI am truly ashamed, embarrassed, and disappointed with myself, and am deeply and sincerely remorseful for my actions. This is not a reflection of who I am, nor the person I want to be.\u201d\nAaron also spoke out in his own victim impact statement in court on Thursday.\n\u201cFor seven years I thought I was in the most loving relationship of marriage with my best friend, someone who I trusted in whole heart and laughed with every day,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cSomeone who made me feel like I was settled \u2014 like I was her one and only. I was loyal to her and [did] whatever I could to make her happy. I thought we were something very special, and so did everyone else.\u201d\nAaron stated that he found out in September 2024 that Victoria had been cheating on him with \u201cmultiple men,\u201d including convicted killer Grant Amato, who is currently serving a life sentence in Florida. (Police records obtained by Us in March revealed that Victoria was communicating with Amato about \u201chow much they are in love\u201d and seemingly discussed her alleged murder plot.)\n\u201cI gave her the option of divorce where we could work. We could try to work it out because I loved her so much. She felt so bad and I didn\u2019t want to and [she] didn\u2019t want to lose me every day. She made me feel so special and she was very \u2014 she was so sorry. At least that\u2019s what you told me,\u201d Aaron said, speaking directly to Victoria. \u201cNow discovering she put a hit out to kill me more than once, got blackmailed and spent almost all our savings to keep it quiet and fell more in love with Amato. They even got spiritually married and now I was called the first husband. They talked until she was arrested, and she sought out his help to kill me.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cThis has led me into fear of my life. I\u2019ve hired Secure Armed Security for weeks, not knowing it was over or not a lot, always looking over my shoulder and having to go through therapy and even trying to understand any of it. It\u2019s like a heartbreak no one should go through in life. I can\u2019t trust anything anymore. I cry every day. I feel so alone. She groomed me into a person I never was. I will wonder why, but worst of all she lied to me every day. I didn\u2019t know about any of the murder plot, hit man or the blackmail until the detectives told me after she was arrested. Now behind bars she\u2019s trying to manipulate through lawyers and trying to silence me and not come here today.\u201d\nAaron then spoke directly to the judge.\n\u201cThis person over here, I don\u2019t know at all. Not one bit. The fact that this person did all this to me with no worry, no care or love in her heart for me, I will never feel the same. I will never feel safe or be the same,\u201d he said. \u201cBut because of what she did, especially when she gets out one day, she claims she\u2019s remorseful now that she\u2019s been caught. But at no time before did she ever try to stop this from happening. She tried to have me killed. She gave my location to people. I truly believed we were trying.\u201d\nThe statement concluded: \u201cShe even asked for the updates on the murder and this was all when I was just a loving husband. I thought whether she got minimum or maximum time, I still won\u2019t feel safe whenever she\u2019s released. I feel like this deserves prison time. I don\u2019t know. So, I just leave it in your hands, Your Honor, and thank you.\u201d"

      "text": "Ghost Adventures star Aaron Goodwin believes that his estranged wife, Victoria Goodwin, is \u201cspiritually married\u201d to the man she allegedly hired to murder him.\n\u201cShe made me feel so [much] more special,\u201d Aaron, 49, said in his victim impact statement during Victoria\u2019s court hearing on Thursday, June 5. \u201cNow, discovering she put a hit out to kill me more than once, got blackmailed and spent almost all our savings to keep it quiet, and [she] fell more in love with [Grant] Amato. They even got spiritually married, and now I was called \u2018the first husband.\u2019\u201d\nAaron further claimed that Victoria, 32, and Amato \u201ctalked until she was arrested.\u201d (Victoria and Amato, who are both incarcerated, have not addressed Aaron\u2019s accusations.)\nVictoria was arrested in March, six days before Aaron filed for divorce, on charges of soliciting to commit murder and conspiring to commit murder. Victoria, who was held on $100,000 bail, has pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charges and was sentenced to 90 months in jail.\nIn police records obtained by Us Weekly, Victoria was communicating with Amato \u2014 who is serving a life sentence in a Florida prison for the murder of his parents and brother \u2014 about wanting to leave her marriage. She allegedly started a pen pal relationship with Amato, telling him that she wanted to \u201cend [Aaron\u2019s] existence\u201d instead of filing for divorce. Their text records also allegedly indicated that Victoria and Amato were \u201cin love.\u201d\nVictoria, who married Aaron in 2020, reportedly admitted in a police interrogation earlier this year that she and the reality TV star had been struggling in their marriage. She also claimed that the funds she transferred to Amato were meant to be used for cell phones.\nConfronting Victoria on Thursday, Aaron said that he \u201cfeared for his life\u201d amid her apparent threats.\n\u201cI\u2019ve hired secure, armed security for weeks, not knowing it was over or not a lot, always looking over my shoulder and having to go through therapy and even trying to understand any of it,\u201d he claimed in his statement. \u201cIt\u2019s like a heartbreak no one should go through in life. I can\u2019t trust anything anymore. I cry every day. I feel so alone.\u201d\nAaron further claimed that he was unaware of the alleged murder plot or hit man employment until Victoria\u2019s arrest.\n\u201cI thought whether she got minimum or maximum time, I still won\u2019t feel safe whenever she\u2019s released. I feel like this deserves prison time,\u201d he pleaded to the judge, arguing that he was a devoted and \u201cloving\u201d husband throughout their marriage."

      "text": "In the span of three years, Aaron and Victoria Goodwin went from Disneyland newlyweds to opposite sides of an alleged murder plot.\nVictoria was sentenced to 36 to 90 months in prison in June 2025 after pleading guilty to conspiring to commit murder. An arrest report obtained by Us Weekly appeared to show Victoria texting Florida inmate Grant Amato in a plan to have her Ghost Adventures star husband killed.\nShe was arrested in March 2025 and Aaron filed for divorce days later. Following her arrest, Aaron\u2019s Ghost Adventures costars expressed their shock at the news, saying they had no idea there were any problems in their relationship.\n\u201cThe rest of the cast was shocked by the news. No one knew anything was wrong in their relationship,\u201d a source exclusively told Us at the time. \u201cEveryone who works on the show can\u2019t believe this is happening. They are all currently in a state of shock.\u201d\nThe source added that the cast, which also includes Zak Bagans, Billy Tolley and Jay Wasley, rallied around Aaron after filming for the series\u2019 28th season ended.\nAaron and Victoria got married in 2022, but their relationship dates back at least three years prior, according to Aaron\u2019s Instagram page. Keep scrolling for more on the former couple\u2019s timeline.\nOctober 2019\nAaron popped the question in October 2019 in front of a Disneyland castle.\n\u201cShe said yes \ud83d\udc8d\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\ude01,\u201d he wrote via Instagram alongside a photo of Victoria looking shocked as she saw the ring.\nAugust 2022\nThough the couple planned to get married in 2020, the pandemic forced them to postpone. Finally, the two tied the knot in 2022, again at Disneyland. Fittingly for Aaron, they later took photos in front of the park\u2019s Haunted Mansion.\n\u201cIt finally happened \ud83d\udc8d we got married,\u201d he wrote via Instagram. \u201cAfter postponing many times due to Covid we got our day. I couldn\u2019t be happier \u2764\ufe0f.\u201d\n2024\nVictoria allegedly worked with Amato on a plan to have Aaron killed while he was traveling in 2024 to shoot Ghost Adventures. She began conversing with the Florida inmate in May, primarily over text message.\nOne message, allegedly from Victoria, read: \u201cAm I a bad person? Because I chose to end his existence. Not divorce.\u201d\nLaw enforcement uncovered the plot when they seized Amato\u2019s phone in prison.\nMarch 6, 2025\nVictoria was arrested on March 6, 2025 on charges of soliciting to commit murder and conspiring to commit murder. She initially denied the allegations and was held on $100,000 bail.\nMarch 13, 2025\nDays after Victoria\u2019s arrest, Aaron filed for divorce. The filing, obtained by Us, said there was no chance of reconciliation between the two.\n\u201cThe views, tastes, likes and dislikes of husband and wife have become incompatible to the extent that it has become impossible for them to live together \u2026 in marital harmony,\u201d the documents read. \u201cThere is no possibility of reconciliation.\u201d\nApril 2025\nVictoria pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit murder. As part of her plea deal, prosecutors dropped the soliciting to commit murder charge and she faced anywhere from two to 10 years in prison with the possibility for parole.\nJune 2025\nAaron spoke out in a victim impact statement on the day of Victoria\u2019s sentencing, alleging he learned in 2024 that Victoria had cheated on him with multiple men, including Amato. (Police records obtained by Us in March revealed that Victoria was communicating with Amato about \u201chow much they are in love\u201d and seemingly discussed her alleged murder plot.)\n\u201cFor seven years I thought I was in the most loving relationship of marriage with my best friend, someone who I trusted in whole heart and laughed with every day,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cSomeone who made me feel like I was settled \u2014 like I was her one and only. I was loyal to her and [did] whatever I could to make her happy. I thought we were something very special, and so did everyone else.\u201d\nVictoria was also able to address her estranged husband.\n\u201cFirstly, and most importantly, I would like to apologize to Aaron. I\u2019m so immensely sorry for the pain and anxiety I\u2019ve caused you and the betrayal you undoubtedly and rightfully feel by my actions,\u201d she said. \u201cI need you to know that I will always hold love for you. I genuinely pray you find your joy and peace again, and I will bow out of your life forever to hopefully ease that process. I\u2019m sorry I broke us, and I\u2019m consumed with regret every day. My absolute promise to you is that you\u2019ll never see or hear from me.\u201d"

It has really helped a lot and I appreciate you all,\u201d Aaron wrote.\nSocial media users continued to express well-wishes for Aaron in the comments section. \u201cI know it sounds weird coming from complete strangers, but we adore and care for you! Keep your chin up,\u201d one fan wrote, while another sent \u201cpositive healing energy\u201d to Aaron. Others noted that they were glad Aaron is safe.\nThe Instagram upload marked the first time Aaron has spoken out following Victoria\u2019s arrest on charges of soliciting to commit murder and conspiring to commit murder. According to police records obtained by Us Weekly earlier this month, Victoria was communicating with convicted killer Grant Amato, who is currently serving a life sentence in Florida for the murders of his parents and brother. Victoria allegedly began writing to Amato in March 2024 after watching the docuseries Ctrl + Alt + Desire, which chronicled Amato\u2019s case.\nVictoria subsequently began texting Amato, allegedly discussing \u201chow much they are in love.\u201d In another alleged message, Victoria brought up wanting to leave her marriage to Aaron, writing, \u201cAm I a bad person? Because I chose to end his existence. Not divorce.\u201d\nVictoria allegedly set aside $11,515 to pay Amato, and they had communicated about a $2,500 upfront payment. Corrections officers reportedly found and seized Amato\u2019s phone in prison, discovering Victoria\u2019s alleged murder plot, but she claimed she didn\u2019t remember sending the messages. She did, however, admit to experiencing trouble in her marriage when questioned by police. She was held on $100,000 bail.\nAaron and Victoria tied the knot in 2020. Us broke the news on March 13 that Aaron filed for divorce in Clark County, Nevada, seeking to maintain his separate property and have their community assets divided equally. He asked for the costs of the community assets to be reimbursed and for his single status to be restored.\nDays later, Aaron amended his divorce filing, accusing Victoria of negligence, false imprisonment and more. According to the March 19 petition, obtained exclusively by Us, Aaron is seeking punitive and exemplary damages totaling more than $10,000.\n\u201c[Victoria\u2019s] conduct was extreme or outrageous with either the intention of or reckless disregard for, causing emotional distress to [Aaron],\u201d the court filing reads. \u201c[He] suffered severe or extreme emotional distress as the actual or proximate result of [her] conduct.\u201d\nAaron further accused Victoria of assault and false imprisonment, claiming she made him \u201cfeel apprehension of harmful or offensive behavior.\u201d He alleged that his estranged wife intended to \u201cconfine [him] within boundaries,\u201d with the petition stating, \u201c[Aaron] was conscious of the confinement or was harmed by it.\u201d\nVictoria, meanwhile, has not publicly addressed the claims. The divorce news came as a surprise to Aaron\u2019s Ghost Adventures costars Zak Bagans, Billy Tolley and Jay Wasley.\n\u201cNo one knew anything was wrong in their relationship,\u201d a source exclusively told Us earlier this month, adding that the cast and crew are \u201ctrying to be supportive of Aaron by reaching out and offering to help in any way they can.\u201d\nIf you or someone you know are experiencing domestic violence, please call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential support."

The owner didn\u2019t like that too much,\u201d he said.\nBagans told Us of a frightening encounter in February that he had with another doll that left him scared and fighting for his life.\nHe explained, \u201cIt was a demonic infestation and severely affected me, and I was literally in the hospital the next day. It was a two-month-long attachment and one of the worst experiences of my life.\u201d\nBagans said in his 21 years of paranormal investigation, the February encounter was one of \u201cthe top two worst attachments I have ever had in my career.\u201d\nHe said a family in Las Vegas and the owner came under possession of the doll \u2014 and shockingly, two members of the doll owner\u2019s family tried to take their lives.\nBagans said he was trying to \u201ccast the demon out of this doll\u201d himself after his exorcist wasn\u2019t able to take on the \u201curgent\u201d case.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when it backfired. I have never seen a doll like this in my life. I brought it to my house that night and I was projectile vomiting the next morning and had pain in my side,\u201d he told Us.\nThe terrifying aftermath led the famed investigator to frequent the chapel at his home to say prayers and blessings 10 times a day.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how bad my attachment was and I had very dark thoughts.\u201d\nBagans said something in his house told him he was \u201cgoing to die\u201d for two weeks. He added, \u201cThere was a black shadow-type figure that I would see in my bedroom. It affected my assistant who had tumors in their neck. My relationship got messed up. It affected my mom. But those things went away. And it all happened around the same time. How did that happen?\u201d\nHe said his doctors ran tests and took an MRI, but his severe health issues later \u201cdisappeared.\u201d\nHe told Us the \u201chorrible\u201d months-long experience caused him to take a break from paranormal demonic investigations. \u201cIt goes to show you as someone who does this for a living, dolls can be vessels for demonic possession and attachment,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cDo I believe that dolls can be vessels for demons? Absolutely. Do I feel they can affect people? Yes, I do.\u201d\nOn July 13, Rivera died while on the Devils on the Run tour in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where the reportedly haunted doll Annabelle was being displayed.\nThe police confirmed they responded to a call at the hotel where the tour was being held over a report of a dead man.\n\u201cThe decedent was discovered in his hotel room by workers,\u201d the police said. \u201cNothing unusual or suspicious was observed at the scene.\u201d\nAccording to Francis Dutrow, Adams County coroner, Rivera\u2019s autopsy is completed. A cause of death has been deferred pending toxicology, which could take eight to 10 weeks.\nThe New England Society for Psychic Research said it planned to continue its scheduled tour across the United States despite Rivera\u2019s death.\nAnnabelle has been described as \u201cdemonically possessed.\u201d People reported that the New England Society for Psychic Research, where Rivera worked and which was founded by famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, said the doll\u2019s history goes back to 1968.\nA woman was gifted the doll, a fictional version of which is depicted in the Conjuring film franchise. After the woman\u2019s roommates claimed to notice weird things happening with the doll, a medium reportedly told them the doll was possessed by a young girl named Annabelle.\nEd and Lorraine took the doll from the woman and kept it locked up for years. The Warren family later displayed the doll in their museum and occasionally lent it out for tours like the one Rivera was part of at the time of his death."

      "text": "'Ghost Adventures' Star's Wife Plotted His Murder With Convicted Killer, Cops Say\n'Ghost Adventures' Aaron Goodwin Wife Enlisted Convicted Killer ... In Murder-for-Hire Plot, Cops Say\nThe Florida inmate who cops say was communicating with the wife of \"Ghost Adventures\" star Aaron Goodwin as part of her alleged murder-for-hire plot is a convicted killer himself ... TMZ has learned.\nPolice say Aaron's wife, Victoria Goodwin, hatched a plan to off her husband to get out of her marriage ... and she allegedly enlisted a prisoner named Grant Amato to help her see the diabolical plan through.\nWell, we did some digging and discovered Amato is serving a life sentence for a triple murder involving his family. A former nurse, Amato was found guilty in 2019 of fatally shooting his father, mother and brother in their Florida home.\nBefore the murders, Amato was accused of stealing $210,000 from his family and spending the funds on a webcam model from Bulgaria who he met on a pornographic website.\nCops say Victoria told them she first learned about Amato in a true-crime documentary and became pen pals with him while he was behind bars.\nPolice say Victoria told Amato she wanted to kill Aaron and provided information about Aaron's location and set times in California while he was filming \"Ghost Adventures\" with Zak Bagans.\nCops say Aaron's wife and Amato set aside $11,515 to pay the alleged hitman ... and Amato messaged someone about the alleged plot, texting them ... \"He's asleep right now in the hotel room ... I need to know what's going on. Can I get an update. Was it done?\"\nThe murder never happened ... but as we first reported, Victoria was arrested last week and charged with solicitation to commit murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\nAaron told us he was blindsided by the developments, and now he's getting court-ordered protection from her. According to new legal docs, obtained by TMZ, Victoria is barred from contacting Aaron for the next 3 months.\nTMZ also spoke with Amato's former defense attorney, Jared Shapiro, who repped him in his triple murder case, which was the subject of a Paramount+ documentary, \"CTRL+ALT+DESIRE.\"\nShapiro described Amato as a \"normal person\" until he committed the homicides, adding that he has a calm demeanor and nothing really phases him, including jail.\nShapiro also says Amato believes he's always the smartest person in the room and comes off as \"arrogantly intelligent.\"\nFurthermore, Shapiro says Amato enjoys the spotlight and was speaking to Paramount+ producers about the documentary while he was in jail for the murders.\nWhat's more, Shapiro says he's not surprised Amato was allegedly involved in the murder-for-hire plot because he likes the attention and wants to feel useful.\nSo far, Vegas prosecutors have yet to charge Amato in the attempted contract killing."

Aaron Goodwin then delivered a statement, speaking through tears about his \"fear.\"\n\"This has led me to fear for my life,\" he said of discovering that his wife had put a hit out on him. \"I can't trust anything anymore. I cry every day, I feel so alone. She turned me into a person I never was.\"\nGoodwin was originally arrested in March on suspicion of two felony charges: solicitation to commit murder and conspiring to commit murder, according to county court records.\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Goodwin hired, commanded or otherwise solicited up to two people to \"commit the murder of Aaron Goodwin.\" They say she conspired with a man via cell phone communications to have her husband \"killed by a third party by providing the location of the victim and providing funds to pay for the murder.\"\nInvestigators uncovered the alleged plot through Victoria Goodwin's text and Facebook message communications with an inmate in Florida, discovered on his phone when it was seized by correction officers in October.\nDuring an interview with detectives before her arrest, Goodwin revealed she had become aware of the Florida inmate \"through a true crime documentary and began writing to him.\"\n\"Victoria explained at the time of the text messages,\" with the inmate, \"she and Aaron were going through problems in their marriage. She further described being lonely and began connecting\" with the Florida inmate, the report states. When asked about \"texts soliciting and conspiring to murder Aaron,\" police said \"she denied wanting her husband to be killed\" and denied remembering those specific messages.\nWho are Victoria and Aaron Goodwin?\nAaron Goodwin is a camera operator and star of the Discovery+ paranormal and reality TV series \"Ghost Adventures\" led by paranormal investigator Zak Bagans.
