  "description": "Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love says it was the right choice to have surgery to repair a torn ligament in the thumb of his non-throwing hand because the season hasn't started.",
  "content": "WESTFIELD, Ind. (AP) \u2014 Jordan Love showed up to Thursday\u2019s practice wearing a red jersey and a bucket hat, his injured left thumb in a protective cast.\n\nA short distance away, on a second field, Anthony Richardson and Daniel Jones resumed their battle to become the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 starter.\n\nYes, the joint practice between the Green Bay Packers and Colts just outside Indianapolis went just like any other training camp practice \u2014 with all eyes studying the good, bad and ugly of the quarterbacks.\n\n\u201cHad a torn ligament in my thumb and we did a surgery to repair it. So on the road to recovery,\u201d Love said in his first public comments since having the procedure earlier this week on his non-throwing hand. \u201cIf this was in the middle of the season, we probably would have been doing something that we didn\u2019t get the surgery on. But with it still being early, having time to recover and be fully ready for Week 1, the recommendation was for surgery.\u201d\n\nThe hope is Love begins working his way back next week and will have a couple of additional weeks to recover before Green Bay\u2019s Sept. 7 season opener against Detroit. Love said it hasn\u2019t been decided whether he\u2019ll participate in next week\u2019s joint practice with Seattle.\n\nSo for now, Malik Willis is running the offense. Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst told reporters Tuesday that Love would be out at least a week.\n\n\u201cI think easing back into it, we might do some things differently just to protect the thumb for now,\u201d Love said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of those things where, after having the surgery, you don\u2019t want to go back out there and re-injure it before the season. So we\u2019ll be smart with it.\u201d\n\nLove was injured on the final play of Green Bay\u2019s second series in last week\u2019s loss to the New York Jets. Initially, he said he didn\u2019t think anything was wrong, but he talked with trainers to see what they thought. While he practiced Monday, Love was making handoffs with his right hand instead of his left.\n\nMeanwhile, the Colts still haven\u2019t announced who will start their opener against Miami.\n\nRichardson is expected to get his most extensive action of the preseason when the Colts and Packers square off Saturday. Coach Shane Steichen said earlier this week he plans to use Jones for the first two series and let Richardson take most of the first-half snaps.\n\nThat assumes Richardson stays healthy. He missed some of Indy\u2019s offseason workouts with a sore throwing shoulder, and then dislocated the pinkie on his throwing hand during last week\u2019s preseason loss at Baltimore. Trainers popped the finger back into place, but Richardson didn\u2019t take another snap against the Ravens because he couldn\u2019t grip the ball properly.\n\nBy Saturday, he was back on the practice field.\n\nJones and Richardson continued to split snaps Thursday, with both taking turns with the starters and the backups.\n\nBut as another week nears its end, no starter has been named.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s natural,\u201d Jones said when asked if he wonders when a winner will emerge. \u201cI think in this position, obviously, you\u2019re aware of it and are thinking about it. But I think you know that strategy for me and anyone in this situation is kind of focus as much as you can on what you need to do.\u201d\n\nColts coach Shane Steichen and Packers coach Matt LaFleur were watching more than just quarterbacks, especially after miserable opening-week performances from both teams.\n\nNear the end of practice, the Packers were credited with a sack of Jones, who then threw an interception as play continued.\n\nHe was far from alone in making a mistake.\n\n\u201cI think our youth showed a little bit today in some instances with the injuries we have,\u201d Packers tight end Tucker Kraft said. \u201cWe\u2019re out here, full pads, expecting big things from some of the guys we\u2019re elevating and I think we just left some meat on the bone.\u201d\n\nColts receiver Josh Downs suffered a hamstring injury during the practice. Steichen did not have an update on the severity of the injury. Steichen also said defensive end Samson Ebukam has a back injury.",

      "text": "How Rattler and Shough handled live pass rush will be another data point in Saints\u2019 QB competition\nHow Rattler and Shough handled live pass rush will be another data point in Saints\u2019 QB competition\nCARSON, Calif. (AP) \u2014 If there was one constant for New Orleans Saints quarterbacks Spencer Rattler and Tyler Shough during their stay in Southern California, it was pressure.\nNot just the pressure of the competition to be the Saints\u2019 starter, but pressure from pass rushers of the two Los Angeles teams, first in a preseason loss to the Chargers on Sunday and again in a joint practice with the Rams on Thursday.\nEvaluating how Rattler, who started six games as a rookie last season, and Shough, a second-round NFL draft pick in April, handled that steady duress could go a long way in deciding who starts the season opener on Sept. 7.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be process-focused,\u201d coach Kellen Moore said. \u201cJust make sure they\u2019re going through the right process. And so a couple of those plays, sack, no sack, we\u2019ll see. Certainly there may have been (sacks), but you just got to finish the play.\u201d\nThe two young quarterbacks split work with the first-unit offense against Los Angeles\u2019 starters in a quickly arranged workout, which came together over the weekend after the Rams had a previously scheduled session with the Chargers canceled.\nThat meant subjecting Rattler and Shough to the Rams\u2019 fierce defensive line four days after they took five sacks combined against the Chargers in a 27-13 defeat. Rattler immediately found himself staring down a free rusher in the first period of the scrimmage, only being spared from having to pick himself up off the grass because defensive tackle Tyler Davis ran past him.\nBut in the infrequent instances where the pocket was kept clean, Rattler and Shough were able to move the ball. Rashid Shaheed caught a deep go route from Rattler for the Saints\u2019 biggest gain of the day, while Shough was able to drive the offense into position to kick a field goal during an unscripted two-minute drill.\n\u201cWhen you play in some un-scouted situations, it\u2019s great work,\u201d Moore said. \u201cYou got to respond, you got to trust yourself, you got to react. And so there\u2019s plenty of opportunities to grow, I think, first and foremost. But they did respond, and they kept fighting, and they kept making some plays, and so it\u2019ll be great film for our guys to watch.\u201d\nMoore, a first-time head coach after stints as offensive coordinator for the Dallas Cowboys, Chargers, and Philadelphia Eagles, would like to pick a quarterback as soon as possible. At the same time, he doesn\u2019t want a rushed decision to impair the development of the 24-year-old Rattler and the 25-year-old Shough.\n\u201cThey need experience, they need exposure,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThere\u2019s some things they are doing for the first time, maybe the second time, and so we just need time on task for them.\u201d\nGetting to run 83 plays on offense against another opponent helped in that process. There were also chances for Rattler and Shough to experience everything that comes when things aren\u2019t going well, with their leadership and attitudes being factors that will help determine who gets the first snap against the Arizona Cardinals in less than a month.\n\u201cBecause you know there\u2019s going to be highs, there\u2019s going to be lows within drives and games, and how you kind of get the guys rallied together, I think it\u2019s an important aspect,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThese guys have done a nice job. They just got to keep getting better.\u201d\nMoore has certainly had a good look at the resilience of Rattler and Shough this week. Center Erik McCoy acknowledged the struggles in pass protection, saying the Saints started \u201ca little slow\u201d but felt there was improvement as the practice went on. How the offensive line fares will go a long way in determining how much success whoever gets the nod at quarterback has.\n\u201cI think our quarterbacks have done a nice job of facing adversity, experiencing adversity, and then responding,\u201d Moore said. \u201cNow, we just got to limit the adversity as much as we can and keep growing.\u201d\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL"

(AP) \u2014 The 49ers bottled up Raiders running back Ashton Jeanty for the most part Thursday, similar to what Seattle did in a preseason game a week earlier in holding him to minus-1 yard on three carries.\nBut Jeanty still provided a reminder in the joint practice of why he was drafted sixth overall this year by Las Vegas.\nHe found an opening to the left side of the offensive line, hit the hole hard and was off and running for a 72-yard touchdown.\n\u201cHe learns and he grows with every single experience,\u201d Raiders quarterback Geno Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s going to make him a great player because he\u2019s getting better (each) day. He definitely took another step today.\u201d\nThe teams practiced in front of more than 2,000 fans at the Raiders\u2019 facility, and they will meet in a preseason game Saturday at Allegiant Stadium. The domed stadium will provide a much different atmosphere than the outside fields in which the temperatures pushed 100 degrees.\nSan Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan said he is planning to play at least some starters on Saturday, including possibly quarterback Brock Purdy for the first time this preseason. But the banged-up 49ers are missing several potential starters to injuries that kept them out of the practice Thursday and also will for the upcoming game.\nDefensive end Nick Bosa (neck) was among those not practicing, a list that included safety Jason Pinnock (heel), cornerback Tre Brown (heel), guard Ben Bartch (elbow), cornerback Upton Stout (calf), wide receiver Jordan Watkins (ankle) and defensive end Robert Beal (abductor). Then on Thursday, defensive tackle C.J. West hyperextended his knee and is expected to miss at least one week.\n\u201cI think there are three healthy starters on defense right now, so I have to decide on those three guys,\u201d Shanahan said about the game Saturday \u201cBut it does put a lot more pressure on the threes. The twos become the ones, the threes become the twos, and we don\u2019t really have threes right now. I look at it all and how much time you\u2019re getting in the next few weeks, and I\u2019d like to get a lot of work for as many guys as I can on Saturday.\u201d\nThe Raiders are much healthier, but rookie wide receiver Dont\u2019e Thornton \u2014 who has been practicing with the starters \u2014 banged his head and left practice. Raiders coach Pete Carroll said he didn\u2019t think the injury was serious.\nKeeping it mostly calm\nThe intensity between the former Bay Area rivals increased as the temperatures rose, but the four skirmishes were minor.\n\u201cWe were out here missing 20 guys,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cWe have some positions that don\u2019t really have enough to go. If you get punched and you throw a punch back, I told the guys, it shows how mentally weak you are because all you\u2019re going to do is leave five guys left to do the whole practice.\u201d\nCarroll said it was important for the focus to be on the tasks at hand.\n\u201cWe come here to play good football and get better, and I think both sides did a great job of showing that,\u201d Carroll said.\nPumping up a teammate\nRaiders wide receiver Tre Tucker dropped a pass at one point in the practice, and Smith immediately went over and gave him a pep talk.\nTucker responded by making two outstanding touchdown catches, one falling on his back in the end zone and the other over 49ers standout cornerback Deommodore Lenoir.\n\u201cWe strive for perfection, but we\u2019re all human,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe main thing whenever a guy makes a mistake or anything happens out there that we don\u2019t want to happen, it\u2019s about showing that we have each other\u2019s back. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for, and they do it for me as well.\u201d\nSeattle in Las Vegas\nThe 49ers and Seahawks are NFC West rivals, so it should be a little surprise that the Raiders\u2019 defense looked a little familiar to San Francisco players.\nCarroll is in his first season in Las Vegas after 14 years in Seattle where he made the Legion of Boom defense among the NFL\u2019s fiercest.\n\u201cYou could see them doing that now, which is pretty cool,\u201d Purdy said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to continue to get better with it when you\u2019ve got (Raiders defensive end) Maxx Crosby and those guys rushing the pocket. They had a couple good reps today of getting in there, so disruptive, but still pretty good scheme-wise overall. So it was good going up against them.\u201d\n___\nFreelance writer W.G.

(AP) \u2014 The Indianapolis Colts quarterback competition is back in full swing after Anthony Richardson returned to practice Saturday.\nHis return comes two days after he dislocated the pinkie on his right hand in Thursday\u2019s 24-16 preseason loss to the Baltimore Ravens.\nRichardson was injured on Indy\u2019s second possession when unblocked linebacker David Ojabo drove Richardson into the ground. Richardson said he noticed the pinkie was bent at an awkward angle when he got up and headed immediately to the sideline where trainers popped the finger into place.\nHe attempted to throw on the sideline but did not return.\nIt\u2019s the latest chapter in a short career that has been beset by injuries.\nRichardson is 8-7 in 15 starts since the Colts drafted him No. 4 overall in 2023. Richardson also has been unable to finish several other games because of injuries and was benched for two games last season after leaving a game because he needed a breather.\nHis other problem; Accuracy. Richardson completed 47.7% of his passes last season, the lowest rate among the league\u2019s regular starters, while throwing 13 career interceptions compared with 11 TD passes.\nThe combination prompted Indy to sign free agent Daniel Jones to a one-year, $14 million free agent deal in March, setting up a competition between the incumbent and Jones, who was selected sixth overall by the New York Giants in the 2019 draft.\nJones was released during last season less than two years after he was rewarded for taking the Giants to the playoffs with a four-year, $160 million contract extension.\nJones was 10 of 21 with 144 yards at Baltimore while Richardson was 2 of 3 with 21 yards.\nPrior to the game, coach Shane Steichen said he intended to start Richardson against Baltimore and let him play more than one quarter before flipping the script next Saturday against Green Bay.\nBut afterward, Steichen acknowledged the plan could change \u2014 if Richardson could play against the Packers. Steichen was not scheduled to meet with reporters at training camp until Sunday.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl"

Love started the game and went 1 of 5 for 7 yards with neither of the two drives he led resulting in points.\nThe injury is to Love\u2019s non-throwing hand and occurred, coach Matt LaFleur said, when he was sacked for a 3-yard loss by Jay Tufele on the quarterback\u2019s final snap from scrimmage.\nLaFleur said he\u2019s been informed the recovery process is a quick one, with the expectation Love will be back at practice in some capacity next week. Green Bay travels to play Indianapolis on Aug. 16, and LaFleur has already ruled out Love from playing in the Packers\u2019 final preseason game against Seattle on Aug. 23.\nThe decision for Love to have the procedure came after he took part in practice Monday.\nLaFleur credited the third-year starter for \u201cpowering through\u201d the session while exclusively handing off the ball with his right hand.\nMalik Willis is the Packers primary backup and had two starts in seven appearances last year after being acquired in a trade from Tennessee.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl"

(AP) \u2014 The top quarterbacks in last year\u2019s NFL draft accounted for six of the top 12 picks, and they had a wide range of results in their rookie year, from award-winning to not applicable.\nDrake Maye, though picked as an injury replacement for the Pro Bowl, had a bumpy debut while the New England Patriots went 4-13. J.J. McCarthy didn\u2019t play at all for the Minnesota Vikings, after he was sidelined by a torn meniscus in his right knee.\nThe bright side for both players was plenty of room for real progress, which became a bit easier to envision this week during joint practices between the Patriots and Vikings.\nMcCarthy stole the show on Thursday, producing perhaps his finest performance of training camp in terms of accuracy, decisiveness and head-turning completions during full-team drills, particularly in 11-on-11 red zone situations.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be some throws where you\u2019ve got to squeeze it in a window, some throws where he threw it up and over some guys and found some open grass with the ability to throw the football in different ways,\u201d Vikings coach Kevin O\u2019Connell said. \u201cAll things we\u2019ve been working on, all things he\u2019s talented and capable of doing, but to do it in this setting should give him some confidence moving forward.\u201d\nO\u2019Connell has been stressing to McCarthy the importance of \u201clayering\u201d his throws, depending on where the defenders are and what route his receivers are running, so that every pass doesn\u2019t leave his hand with the same velocity.\nThe Vikings have raved at every turn about McCarthy\u2019s eagerness to learn and improve since he was first injured a year ago, and that has shown up in practices with the way he\u2019s thrown the ball at different angles and speeds to the right places. The 10th overall pick last year was particularly proud of the touch he had on a pass to Jordan Addison on Thursday in the back of the end zone.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m one of the most accurate guys out there,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cJust being able to take it day by day and really hone in on every single throw.\u201d\nMaye made strong throw after strong throw down the field on Wednesday against a Vikings defense well-known for causing confusion for opponents, but the production by the first-team Patriots offense on Thursday left more to be desired, with the pass rush spearheaded by Jonathan Greenard frequently causing problems for an offensive line that has plenty to prove this season.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to give him time, period,\u201d center Garrett Bradbury said. \u201cAs much time as he needs.\u201d\nLearning to lead\nNew Patriots coach Mike Vrabel has been leaning on Maye, the third overall pick last year, to become more demonstrative in huddles and meetings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s lacking. I always want more. I think I have to as a coach,\u201d Vrabel said. \u201cWe always want to try take a player and meet them where they\u2019re at and then be able to improve on that.\u201d\nMaye said he has been embracing the challenge.\n\u201cI want somebody to push me to do more for the team, have more of an impact with the guys around me,\u201d Maye said. \u201cI feel like if I have that and if I feel like I\u2019m not showing it myself, then I need somebody to push me along.\u201d\nMcCarthy has turned plenty of heads with the Vikings for his beyond-his-years leadership potential.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel like a young guy,\u201d tight end T.J. Hockenson said. \u201cThe way he controls the huddle, his energy in the huddle, how he talks about the game and the mentality is high-level thinking.\u201d\nHappy birthday, dear coach ...\nVrabel celebrated his 50th birthday on the practice field, naturally, but he did have a favorite dessert in mind for later to mark the milestone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s carrot cake. That\u2019s it. There\u2019s one answer. There\u2019s no hemming and hawing,\u201d Vrabel said.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL"
