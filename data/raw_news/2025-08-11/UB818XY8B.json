  "description": "\u201cA Gambler and his Cowboys\u201d is Netflix\u2019s big, shiny ode to the \u201890s Cowboys, and a must-watch for Dallas fans.",
  "content": "In the early going of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Team: A Gambler and His Cowboys,\u201d there\u2019s a moment when Jerry Jones, far and away in the starring role, drops one of his many lines that might give Cowboys fans an eye twitch.\n\nWhen reflecting upon the Cowboys\u2019 watershed victory over the San Francisco 49ers in the 1992 NFC Championship, the Cowboys owner tied the emotion of the moment to his time with the Arkansas football team, when he, teammate Jimmy Johnson and a few dozen other Razorbacks defeated Nebraska in the 1965 Cotton Bowl to secure the national championship.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d been almost 30 years since I\u2019d had that same feeling,\u201d Jones tells the viewer in the series\u2019 third episode. \u201cAnd now with the Dallas Cowboys, it wasn\u2019t just a dream to be a part of winning.\u201d\n\nBad news for the 1993 version of Jerry. Another 30-year wait is in your future.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s Team,\u201d the eight-episode docuseries set for release Aug. 19, is a lot of what you might expect from a documentary about Jerry Jones and the most valuable sports franchise in the world. It\u2019s big, bold, shiny, glamorous. A former President of the United States makes an appearance less than 10 minutes into the first episode.\n\nBut the series is also laced with moments where the viewer, especially if they so happen to be a Cowboys fan of a certain age, will be hit over the head with ironic quotes and cold reminders of how long it\u2019s been since this franchise has achieved anything close to the level of greatness required to win three Super Bowls in a span of four seasons.\n\nWhether it\u2019s Jones reminiscing about the P.T. Barnum-esque words of wisdom from his father (\u201cYou gotta make it look like it works whether it does or not, by mirrors or smoke or wire, you got to look the part.\u201d), or a comment from a local former sports broadcaster who had a longstanding feud with the Cowboys owner.\n\n\u201cWho the hell\u2019s he hired?\u201d asks former WFAA sports anchor Dale Hansen, who was interviewed for the series. \u201dCoaches that nobody wants?\u201d\n\nAnd that was even before Hansen knew Jerry\u2019s pick to lead the Cowboys into the 2025 season.\n\nThat said, \u201cA Gambler and His Cowboys\u201d is sure to be an informative and enjoyable watch for sports fans in general, and it\u2019s a virtual must-watch for Cowboys fans, of any age. Co-directed by brothers Maclain and Chapman Way, who are also responsible for the \u201cUntold\u201d documentary series on Netflix, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Team\u201d is packed with entertainment value, thanks in large part to the staggering amount of access given to the Way duo.\n\nJerry, Jimmy, Barry Switzer, Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Michael Irvin, Deion Sanders \u2014 they\u2019re all major players in the series, sharing open and honest stories with a fun, spaghetti-western style backdrop that\u2019s so perfectly befitting for the series\u2019 subject matter.\n\nBut the web of storytelling also stretches to outrageous characters such as Charles Haley, longtime foes like Steve Young and Jerry Rice, titans of industry like Phil Knight and Rupert Murdoch. Assistant coaches, old staff, former beat reporters ... if they were anywhere around the \u201990s Cowboys and they\u2019ve still got a pulse in 2025, there\u2019s a good chance they are in this documentary.\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot of new ground covered, not many shocking revelations, but behind testimony from Johnson, Switzer, Aikman, Smith and especially Irvin, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Team\u201d does delve quite deeply into the old ground. Nearly entire episodes are devoted to the Jerry-Jimmy rise and fall, the acquisition of Sanders, Irvin\u2019s trial for cocaine possession and how Jones came to purchase the Cowboys franchise in the first place.\n\nAnother thing it makes clear: Jones and Johnson still disagree on quite a bit of stuff. To this day if you tried to get them in a room to nail down which one gets credit for the Herschel Walker trade, you\u2019d be in that room for a while.\n\nJones obviously gets more screentime than anyone else, and while his quotes are sometimes frustrating, there are more humanizing moments from the now 82-year-old Cowboys owner, too.\n\nJones\u2019 kids, Stephen, Charlotte and even Jerry Jr., offer a lot to the series, and the patriarch of the Jones family gets emotional numerous times while discussing his relationship with them, or with his wife, Gene, or with Johnson or Irvin or a number of others.\n\nThere are many tearful moments from Jerry. And there are a few quick shots of his famous JerryDoodles during his interviews as Jones scribbled away absentmindedly on a pad throughout the series. Something for sharp-eyed fans to keep watch for.\n\nJones makes clear that the 30-year wait cuts him deeply. And he\u2019s not the only one. Aikman, Irvin and Smith all share disappointment that often borders on grief when telling of how their time with the team ended, and where things have gone since. At one point Smith recalls being the last man standing during his record-breaking run in 2002 that set the NFL\u2019s all-time rushing record, the championship \u201990s teams having mostly dissolved by then.\n\n\u201cI was thinking when it happened,\u201d a tearful Smith said. \u201cTroy Aikman\u2019s gonna put the ball in my stomach. Daryl Johnston\u2019s gonna be the guy who leads me up the hole. And we\u2019ll all celebrate together. That\u2019s what I was thinking, but as life would have it, things don\u2019t always work out the way you think.\u201d\n\nThere are high highs, and there are low lows, all broken down throughout an eight-episode span that emphasizes in no uncertain terms what a giant strike of lightning in a bottle the 1990s Cowboys were. When things were going well, when Jimmy and Jerry were buds, Aikman, Emmitt and Irvin were cooking and the talent on the field matched the level of the drama surrounding it? This thing was an absolute machine.\n\nIt\u2019s crumbled under Jones\u2019 reign in the 30 years since, leaving Dallas fans with fodder that makes for an easily digestible eight hours on Netflix but isn\u2019t much of a substitute for the greatness of what once was.\n\nFind more Cowboys coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.",

      "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Jerry Jones has cited the time when the Cowboys didn\u2019t have Hall of Fame running back Emmitt Smith for two games amidst a contract negotiation and how the Cowboys still won the Super Bowl that year. He\u2019s cited it often this camp as the Cowboys deal with star pass rusher Micah Parsons, who\u2019s issued a trade request while he doesn\u2019t practice.\nWhile the teams of the \u201990s hang over the Cowboys amid their nearly 30-year Super Bowl drought, the negotiations with Parsons hold over the current team.\nThey even held over Monday\u2019s premiere of the Cowboys\u2019 upcoming Netflix docuseries to a certain extent.\nEmmitt Smith said on Monday that he wanted to \u201cset the record straight\u201d about his negotiation with the Cowboys. He said it should\u2019ve never been called a \u201choldout,\u201d in his words, because he was a free agent and the Cowboys had negotiating rights of him.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest: there\u2019s not a distinct difference between the two,\u201d Smith said about the comparisons between his negotiations and the current negotiations with Parsons. \u201cI didn\u2019t sign until two games in. That\u2019s the only difference. It is what it is. I just hope Parsons get his deal done, because for me, it\u2019s more important to have all this business stuff behind so the team itself can start to do the things they came to do. They came to training camp to work on what? Coming together as a team, forging ahead as a brotherhood, building the chemistry that they need to be. All the other distractions need to be gone.\u201d\nSmith agreed that negotiations with star players can be a distraction to the rest of the locker room, too.\n\u201cThey have to answer these questions every day,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSo they have to deal with something that has nothing to do with the game of football. You see what I\u2019m saying? It\u2019s a distraction. These questions right now have nothing to do with this movie tonight. It\u2019s a distraction. It\u2019s what you want to talk about; it\u2019s not really why I\u2019m here.\u201d\nAnd plenty of people showed up on Monday for that exact reason. Plenty of former Cowboys were there. So was Al Michaels and Marshawn Lynch, among others.\nAnd of course there was the star: the titled gambler of the Cowboys. Plenty of people talked extensively about how the Cowboys became a dynasty. No one perhaps talked more and was followed around the last couple years than Jones himself.\nThere were lessons to take away about how that team came together. Perhaps no one knows that better than the current owner and general manager of that same franchise.\nFind more Cowboys coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

      "text": "Brothers Maclain and Chapman Way grew up in Thousand Oaks, Calif., longtime training site of the Cowboys, but like most of their generation, they have little recall of the last time the franchise was dominant.\nChapman was born in 1986; Maclain in 1991. The Cowboys\u2019 last Super Bowl win, and appearance, was in 1996. And besides, the brothers mostly were Lakers and soccer fans.\nActually, all of the above made them ideal co-directors and executive producers of Netflix\u2019s eight-part documentary, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys.\u201d\nThat\u2019s because in their minds they were starting with a blank canvas and were fascinated to learn every morsel about the 1990s Cowboys dynasty and subsequent downfall.\nWhen you combine natural curiosity with obvious talent the brothers have shown with the likes of 2014\u2019s \u201cThe Battered Bastards of Baseball,\u201d 2018\u2019s \u201cWild Wild Country\u201d and Netflix\u2019s sports documentary series \u201cUntold,\u201d you get the masterfully done \u201cAmerica\u2019s Team.\u201d\nAnd, no, we\u2019re not just saying nice things because Maclain and Chapman cheerfully connected with us for a virtual interview, both bearing resemblances to their uncle, actor Kurt Russell.\nOr because in the series\u2019 Part 1 \u2013 \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d \u2013 the directors for whatever reason used about 2 seconds of footage of yours truly at the Feb. 25, 1989, news conference announcing Jerry Jones\u2019 purchase of the Cowboys.\nOr because Maclain made a point to thank The Dallas Morning News for providing Netflix access to an estimated 20,000 photo negatives.\n\u201cI think they were in the proverbial basement, or the real basement of The Dallas Morning News,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day about six months ago, about four boxes showed up at our office.\n\u201cThey were an absolute game-changer. I mean, there\u2019s the NFL Films footage, but I\u2019d say almost every photo you see in this documentary is from The Dallas Morning News.\u201d\nOK, if you insist, we\u2019ll take a brief bow, but only while standing well behind the Way brothers and Netflix\u2019s production staff.\nHere\u2019s part of our conversation, edited for brevity and clarity.\nWhat thing about the project would you say you are most proud of?\nMaclain Way: I think the thing that we were most proud about, which I think it would have come to anyone that was researching the story early, was the relationship between Jimmy Johnson and Jerry Jones. The thing that stood out early to us is I didn\u2019t know that they were teammates at the University of Arkansas. And I didn\u2019t know that they went 1-15 in their first [Cowboys] year. And so those were two things that on Day One that stood out as \u2018Wow.\u2019\nThose are remarkable milestones for an owner and a head coach to go through \u2026 So I remember interviewing Jerry and Jimmy at length. We did multiple days with Jerry. We did one marathon six- or seven-hour day with Jimmy. And I remember walking off set those days really feeling accomplished, that both of them played ball.\nThey gave really interesting answers about the formation of their relationship with one another; the tension of their relationship; the deterioration of their relationship; their three-year feud; and ultimately some reconciliation that they\u2019ve recently had. I think they didn\u2019t just give stock answers. I was really proud about spending that much time getting those answers.\nChapman Way: I think the thing that we\u2019re most proud about is capturing the humanity of the story. These are such public figures, and they\u2019re so famous. Athletes in a certain way are trained not to open up and not to be vulnerable and talk about a lot of the things that we kind of dove into. And so I think besides just covering the thrilling sports aspect of it, we were really able to kind of capture the humans at the center of this drama. And I\u2019m really, really, really happy with what we walked away with.\nHow and when did the project start?\nMaclain Way: Almost exactly two years ago, we got a phone call from an executive at Netflix that we\u2019ve done a lot of work with, Gabe Spitzer. We\u2019ve done multiple volumes of \u201cUntold\u201d with Gabe. He said, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve landed this project.\u2019 They had been circling it for a while, but Netflix secured the distribution deal on this project.\nI think we were his first phone call that he made in terms of the directors. For us, I think our first reaction was like, \u2018Let us dive in and look at it.\u2019\nI think the thing that stood out was the access to all the characters. Jimmy, Jerry, Troy, Michael, Emmitt, Barry, Charles Haley \u2026 and then also the opportunity to talk to these peripheral characters in Rupert Murdoch and Phil Knight and George W. Bush.\nAs a documentary filmmaker, you look at that whole kind of cast of characters in a way, and you feel confident that you can go in and make something special. And then the second thing that really happened was looking at the NFL Films footage, and how impressed we were from the first time that we ever jumped into and looked at hours and hours of this raw 16 millimeter film.\nI mean, these guys that shot this stuff were so good. They were so technical. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever really get another project like this again, that has this wealth of material \u2014 and local news as well that just covered the Cowboys day-in and day-out. When you look at all these kind of components, I think the project started to become irresistible for us.\nAny idea how many interviews you did?\nMaclain Way: Upwards of 40, I think.\nHow many hours of interviews did you have to cull?\nMaclain Way: I know Jerry did over 40 himself. I would put it over 200 hours of interviews.\nAny interviews you hoped to land but didn\u2019t get?\nMaclain Way: I know that we were interested in trying to talk to Roger Staubach, but his schedule was tough. It took us a while to figure out what opposing teams we wanted to really explore, and we kind of had the obvious ones on our board early.\nBut as the series started to come together, I was really pleased. It wasn\u2019t early on that we went and got interviews with Jerry Rice and Steve Young and Carmen Policy and the 49ers POV. But that was certainly a big component of this \u2013 of what the series ended up becoming, especially in those middle episodes.\nAnd then also Buffalo Bills with Jim Kelly. So those interviews we got, but those weren\u2019t the immediate ones that we knew from Day One that we wanted to get.\nWhat do you think the series\u2019 biggest revelations are?\nChapman Way: I think it\u2019s the depth and sensitivity of the relationship between Jimmy Johnson and Jerry Jones. As a filmmaker, you\u2019re looking back at a story that happened 30 years ago. Your fear is that people have moved on; they don\u2019t care about these things anymore.\nBut to sit down and spend time with them both, intimately, and see how much this relationship has stayed with them over the years and how much it still affects them in modern day, I think as a storyteller was something that really jumped out at us.\nIt was a little bit of a guiding star for us in some ways in telling the story.\nMaclain Way: We grew up in the \u201990s and had an awareness of this, but I think that as the NFL has just grown year after year after year in my lifetime in influence and power and viewership, it seems to be the one thing that kind of grows more and more.\nAnd I look back at this early \u201890s team -- and I know that there\u2019s decades of NFL history that predates this team -- but my experience making this documentary was I looked at the star celebrity of these players.\nOf Emmitt, of Michael and Troy, of Jerry and Jimmy and Charles Haley and Barry Switzer and these cast of characters. And I just felt like that this is where a lot of the power and the reach and the star-celebrity and the media-driven landscape that incorporates the NFL started. In the early 90s. In Dallas, Texas. With this dynasty team.\nI think that this team put the NFL on the path that it is on today. So it\u2019s a very interesting process for me that I didn\u2019t know a lot about this team necessarily, but we knew a lot about the NFL to look back and trace a lot of the DNA of what we know the NFL to be back to this team.\nEven Jerry coming in as, I would say, one of the first fan-owners in the league. There were these legacy owners that kind of operated their teams and they were OK kind of losing money and they spread the risk. It was a little bit more of a civic obligation.\nJerry came in and needed to make money, because he had kind of spent all of his money on this team, and he was certainly one of the first to operate in the wild, wild west of these days of the NFL. And he kind of came in and was certainly a disruptor in the league, and would kind of go against league consensus in a certain way. And so all of that was a big part of the stew that we didn\u2019t necessarily know about, but found out about.\nChapman Way: You know what? I change my answer. The biggest revelation for me was upon meeting Jerry and realizing his flair or drama and storytelling. I think you\u2019re always nervous as a documentarian or a journalist. \u2018Are they going to really dive into this stuff? Are we going to be walking on eggshells?\u2019\nUpon meeting Jerry, man, he understands story. He understands drama and conflict. He knows what makes a good story. For us it was kind of a dream for us to work with a main subject who understands that. I think that was the biggest revelation. We maybe came in a little bit more safe and timid -- and Jerry kind of blew the doors open, upon meeting him. It opened everything up for us to tell the story.\nMaclain Way: We\u2019d ask questions and we would go in a million different directions. It was one of the most fun interviews I think we\u2019ve ever done. Like Chap said, there was never a sense that we were going to offend Jerry or step on his toes in any way. We could have articulate conversations with him and push him on certain areas.\nNowhere on your level, obviously, but when I write a longer story I try to look for an arc where there\u2019s a happy ending or something uplifting, redemption, something at the end. I was racking my brain, like, how are y\u2019all going to come up with that type of ending given what\u2019s happened the last 30 years?\nMaclain Way: Obviously it\u2019s been a tough last 30 years. They haven\u2019t had the success they want. Where does the blame land and who\u2019s responsible for that? It definitely gets into that in episode eight. And like I said, nothing was off limits with Jerry. There were no questions we couldn\u2019t ask, no topics we couldn\u2019t talk about.\nHe gives his POV. We talked to some media people who give their POV. Ultimately episode eight kind of wraps up the Jerry-Jimmy storyline and the Ring of Honor. We were there filming the whole time. We\u2019ve kind of had exclusive access to all that as it was unfolding and there\u2019s some really powerful moments there.\nFind more Cowboys coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

      "text": "Jerry Jones felt it was important to deliver the bad news in person.\nThe decision had been made to move on from Terrell Owens. The Dallas Cowboys owner appreciated what the star receiver had done for the franchise and arranged for him and his son, Stephen, to sit down with Owens and agent Drew Rosenhaus.\nIt was a cordial yet difficult conversation. Jones kept saying how much he thought of Owens. The receiver kept pleading his case to stay. Jones was doodling on a napkin that sat on the table in front of him the entire time.\nWhen the meeting was done and the men stood up to shake hands, Owens had a request.\n\u201cCan I keep that napkin?\u201d he asked.\nStephen laughed as he recounted the story. He doesn\u2019t give his father\u2019s indecipherable scribbling much thought after all these years. But he understands the fascination.\nJerry Jones presides over the most valuable sports property in the world. He\u2019s had a profound impact on the NFL and adroitly leverages the Cowboys brand to expand and diversify his financial empire beyond sports.\nAnd his scribbling?\n\u201cIt\u2019s as logical as what\u2019s going on in his mind,\" said Charlotte Jones, the Cowboys chief brand officer and his daughter. \u201cIt\u2019s as clear to others as the way he speaks.\nA viral sensation\nJones was relaxing in the hallway outside a conference room before last month\u2019s NFL owners meetings got underway. What began as a chat turned into an impromptu interview.\nIn making his points about how the salary cap works and why the club is taking the approach it has this offseason, Jones doodled on a legal pad. Four pages into the interview, he was still doodling.\nA photo of the session was posted on X, along with the owner\u2019s quote about Dak Prescott. Rather than react to what Jones had to say about the Cowboys quarterback, the vast majority of responses focused on the notepad.\nThe post has generated 7.2 million views.\n\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t have any bad words on it,\" Jones joked two days later when informed he had gone viral.\n\u201cI think there are a handful or more of quarterbacks playing who haven\u2019t won a Super Bowl that will win a Super Bowl.\n\u2014 David Moore (@DavidMooreDMN) March 24, 2024\n\u201cI think Dak is one of them. I\u2019m firm there. He\u2019s one of the ones who can.\u201d\n_ Cowboys owner Jerry Jones on Dak Prescott. pic.twitter.com/pZjDACIQqA\nThe Cowboys were drilled by a young, inexperienced Green Bay team in the playoffs three months ago. The organization has been bleeding talent in free agency and hasn\u2019t done much to replace it.\nIt\u2019s not surprising that most of the comments were negative. Some zoomed in on the notepad and flipped it to give a better look at his \u201cnotes.\"\nA sampling of the responses:\n\u201cLooks like the Cowboys offseason plans were leaked.\"\n\u201cCowboys draft plans:\"\n\u201cSomeone get this little guy a juice box and some crayons.\"\n\u201cHey Jerry! Can you show us an outline of your vision for the Cowboys the next few years to address the NFC title game drought?\u201d\nThe responses provided a glimpse into the frustration felt by the Cowboys fan base. But what does it say about Jones and how his mind works?\n\u2018A Beautiful Mind\u2019\nJones remembers applying for a $6 million loan at a bank in the early 1980s. He had gone through several pages of what the bankers were looking for in their application. He began to doodle as he explained his approach and what he had put together.\nTwo or three pages into the chaotic etchings, he wanted to emphasize something he said earlier. He flipped back in his notepad, went about a third of the way down the page and stopped his pen to make a point.\n\u201cLike I said right here, this is what I\u2019m capable of doing with this project,\" Jones told the bankers.\n\u201cYou can read that stuff?\" one of the bankers marveled. \u201cThat\u2019s a miracle.\n\u201cThat actually stands for something with you?\"\nJones looked her right in the eye.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t it stand for something with you?\" he asked.\nHe got the loan.\nJones loves to talk with a pen in his hand. Stephen has seen it in meetings time and time again.\nHis father\u2019s hand will find a point on the paper to start. As he starts to explain or illustrate a point, he usually begins to draw a line that dips. That\u2019s when the scribbling begins.\n\u201cHe can decipher it a little bit on his own, he will tell you,\" Stephen said. \u201cBut I can never translate what it says.\n\u201cWhat is that movie? A Beautiful Mind.\u201d\nThe Academy Award winning film for Best Picture of 2001 depicts the life of John Nash, a renowned mathematician who won a Nobel prize in economics. He suffered from schizophrenia, sometimes becoming lost in an alternate reality created by his delusions and hallucinations.\nStephen isn\u2019t the only one who refers to the movie when talking about his father\u2019s scribbling. So does Charlotte.\nSo do people who work at the Star now and those who no longer work for the organization. They refer to how Jones sees things in what he scrawls that others don\u2019t.\nIt makes sense to him.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter if anyone found his notes,\" Stephen said, recalling how he laughed when someone came across the points of an agreement his father put to paper when ending Emmitt Smith\u2019s holdout in \u201893. \u201cYou can\u2019t make heads or tails out of it.\"\nLose the clutter\nCharlotte remembers asking her parents to sign her work when she was in grade school. That role usually fell to her mother, who had perfect penmanship.\nOne day Charlotte got to school and realized she had forgotten to get a signature. She quickly scrawled something across the top of the page and handed it in.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\" the teacher asked.\n\u201cMy Dad signed it,\" Charlotte responded.\nIt worked.\n\u201cThe funny thing about it is Dad does not like clutter,\" said Charlotte, who now works alongside her father on multi-million dollar projects. \u201cI always seem to have some piles scattered out. Even into adulthood, he\u2019ll walk in and say \u2018clean your office.\u2019 He can\u2019t stand it.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t tolerate visual clutter. Maybe it impedes his ability to create and pull things together. I think to have things structured around him allows him to make more sense of the way he thinks within that structure.\n\u201cHow his mind comes together with an idea is different from how most people think.\"\nIncomprehensible is different from incoherent. The patriarch of the Jones family is frequently asked to bounce from a complex issue in one area of his business to another without missing a beat.\n\u201cI just think that\u2019s really how his mind goes,\" Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy said. \u201cHe jumps in and out of conversations on any topic on a daily basis.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a huge part of his greatness.\"\nJason Cohen is the Cowboys\u2019 general counsel. He\u2019s seen how his employer\u2019s mind works. He will tell you that Jones is constantly doodling, literally and figuratively.\nThe question: Do those doodles carry any legal standing in a court of law?\n\u201cAs to the legal aspect, technically speaking all those scribbles could be discoverable unless they were an attorney-client communication,\" Cohen said.\nStill skeptical?\nThe doodle that had gone viral was a topic of conversation on the family\u2019s flight back to Dallas from the league meetings. Charlotte and Stephen pressed the issue.\n\u201cCan you really read anything you write down?\" Charlotte asked.\nTheir father paused a second for effect.\n\u201cOh yeah,\" he said. \u201cEvery bit of it.\"\nCharlotte and Stephen looked at each other, shook their heads then began to talk about something else.\n\u201cIn some weird way, he\u2019s Picasso,\" Charlotte said. \u201cIt makes sense to him.\"\nCatch David Moore periodically on The Ticket (KTCK-AM 1310 and 96.7 FM) during the offseason.\nTwitter/X: @DavidMooreDMN\nFind more Cowboys coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

      "text": "It\u2019s been a long time since the Dallas Cowboys have appeared in a Super Bowl.\nWith their NFC Championship Game drought at 29 years and counting, the Cowboys haven\u2019t exactly gotten close to that goal. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t relive some of the memories from the past.\nAhead of Super Bowl LIX, let\u2019s take a look back at each of the Cowboys\u2019 Super Bowl appearances and some of the standout moments from each matchup:\n1971: Super Bowl V in Miami\nBaltimore Colts 16, Dallas Cowboys 13\nThe Dallas Cowboys\u2019 first Super Bowl appearance came in the 1970-71 season.\nLed by head coach Tom Landry and their vaunted Doomsday Defense, the Cowboys hit their stride in the postseason to claim an NFC title and a spot in Super Bowl V. That year\u2019s battle for the Lombardi Trophy took place at the Miami Orange Bowl.\nDespite holding a 13-6 halftime lead over Johnny Unitas and the Colts, a sloppy second half saw the Craig Morton-led Cowboys offense go scoreless over the final 30 minutes. Baltimore\u2019s Jim O\u2019Brien kicked a 32-yard field goal with five seconds left to give the Colts a last-second 16-13 win over Dallas.\nOften referred to as the \u201cBlunder Bowl,\u201d Morton threw three interceptions (two in the fourth quarter, with one setting up the game-winning kick) and the Cowboys set what was at the time the record for most penalties committed by a team in the Super Bowl.\nCowboys linebacker Chuck Howley (two interceptions) was named Most Valuable Player, the only Super Bowl in which the award was given to a member of the losing team.\n1972: Super Bowl VI in New Orleans\nDallas Cowboys 24, Miami Dolphins 3\nAfter Super Bowl V the young franchise was building a reputation as one that couldn\u2019t win big games (we\u2019ve come full circle in that aspect). It was to the degree that they were given the nickname of \u201cNext Year\u2019s Champions.\u201d\nBut lying in wait for the struggling Craig Morton was a 27-year-old quarterback returning from a tour of duty in Vietnam with the U.S. Navy. After starting three games the previous season, Roger Staubach forced a quarterback controversy on the 1971 Cowboys. Alternating games between the two resulted in a 4-3 record to start the season, but after Landry stuck with Staubach as the starter the Cowboys won their final seven games of the regular season.\nBehind Staubach, Dallas cruised through the playoffs with relative ease and throttled Miami in the Super Bowl, capturing the first championship in team history. Staubach was named Super Bowl MVP.\nFlashback: Read The Dallas Morning News\u2019 story from the Cowboys\u2019 Super Bowl VI win here.\n1976: Super Bowl X in Miami\nPittsburgh Steelers 21, Dallas Cowboys 17\nAfter a disappointing 1974 season, the first in nine years that the Cowboys failed to make the playoffs, Staubach led Dallas to a 10-4 record and another postseason berth in 1975-76.\nAfter saying a Hail Mary or two, Dallas would meet the defending champion Pittsburgh Steelers for the first of three meetings between the two teams in the Super Bowl. Unfortunately for the Cowboys, this one would be a heartbreaker.\nDallas trailed 21-10 in the fourth quarter after Terry Bradshaw\u2019s 64-yard touchdown pass to Lynn Swann. Staubach and the Cowboys attempted a frantic comeback in the final 3:31 of the game, scoring a touchdown to cut the deficit to 21-17, then forcing a three-and-out by the Steelers to immediately get the ball back.\nThe Cowboys even drove down to the Steelers\u2019 38-yard line with a chance to win the game, but on the final play of the season Staubach\u2019s end zone-bound pass was picked off by Glen Edwards. The Steelers were back-to-back Super Bowl champs.\n1978: Super Bowl XII in New Orleans\nDallas Cowboys 27, Denver Broncos 10\nIn a game that was all about a quarterback grudge match (Staubach and the Cowboys battled a Broncos team now led by Craig Morton), it was the Cowboys\u2019 Doomsday Defense that lifted Dallas to its second Super Bowl championship.\nThe Cowboys forced four interceptions from Morton, who was lifted for Norris Weese in the second half. Morton finished the game with a QB rating of 0.0.\nFor the first time in Super Bowl history, a defensive lineman was named Super Bowl MVP -- two of them, actually. Defensive end Harvey Martin and defensive tackle Randy White were named co-MVPs.\nIt was the last time the Landry-Staubach-era Cowboys would lift the Lombardi Trophy.\nFlashback: Read The Dallas Morning News\u2019 story from the Cowboys\u2019 Super Bowl XII win here.\n1979: Super Bowl XIII in Miami\nPittsburgh Steelers 35, Dallas Cowboys 31\n\u201cJackie Smith ... bless his heart, he has to be the sickest man in America.\u201d\nThat iconic call is the lingering memory from another heartbreaking Cowboys loss to the Steelers, this time in Super Bowl 13. If it\u2019s any consolation to still-grieving Cowboys fans, it\u2019s widely regarded as one of the best Super Bowls ever.\nDallas, again, got down to Pittsburgh early and was attempting to fight back all game. At one point the Cowboys could\u2019ve tied the game on a wide-open pass to Smith in the end zone, and Smith -- a future Hall of Famer, 11th all-time in receiving yards among tight ends -- inexplicably dropped the ball, forcing Dallas to settle for a field goal instead.\nThe Steelers would score two touchdowns in a 19-second span in the fourth quarter to end the Cowboys\u2019 chances. And not just in that game: It would be 14 years before Dallas would make it back to the Super Bowl, at which point Staubach and Landry were long gone from the franchise.\n1993: Super Bowl XVII in Pasadena\nDallas Cowboys 52, Buffalo Bills 17\nIt was the beginning of a new era in Dallas -- and it was off to a dominant start.\nThe Dallas Cowboys franchise roared back to life under Jerry Jones, Jimmy Johnson and \u201cThe Triplets\u201d -- Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin -- and took the NFL by storm. Under Johnson, the Cowboys went from a 1-15 record three seasons prior to an absolute steamrolling of the Buffalo Bills in the Super Bowl.\nThe only lowlight for the Cowboys was Leon Lett\u2019s infamous flub on a long fumble return for what should\u2019ve been a touchdown. Otherwise, Cowboys fans were treated to a four-touchdown performance from the MVP Aikman, a halftime show from Michael Jackson and the team\u2019s first of what would be three championships in a span of four years.\nFlashback: Read The Dallas Morning News\u2019 story from the Cowboys\u2019 Super Bowl XVII win here.\n1994: Super Bowl XVIII in Atlanta\nDallas Cowboys 30, Buffalo Bills 13\nWhile the scoreboard makes this one appear like the Cowboys trounced the Bills in a second straight Super Bowl, it was more of a nail-biter than the year prior. Dallas even trailed 13-6 going into halftime before the lockdown defense and a punishing run game led by eventual MVP Emmitt Smith took over.\nIt started with a 48-yard fumble return touchdown by James Washington to tie the score. Then it was all Emmitt.\nAfter the fumble return, Dallas held Buffalo to a three-and-out. When the offense came back on the field, they\u2019d hand it off to Smith six straight times. No fuss, no flash, just running No. 22 up the gut the entire length of the field. They offered him a break for one play (a 3-yard pass to Daryl Johnston) before handing it back to Smith again, at which point he finished the drive with a 15-yard touchdown run to give the Cowboys a lead they wouldn\u2019t lose.\nIt was an incredible display of power and will from Smith and the Cowboys\u2019 offense, one that secured Dallas\u2019 first back-to-back titles.\nEmmitt Smith\n\u2014 Kevin Gallagher (@KevG163) January 31, 2025\nSUPER BOWL XXVIII\nThe Game-Winning Drive\nAfter tying the score at 13 early in the third quarter, the #DallasCowboys steamroll the #Bills and take over the game.\nEmmitt \u2014 the NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP \u2014 carries the ball seven times for 61 yards on the #Cowboys'\u2026 pic.twitter.com/yxKgMG1dUd\nOn a side note, you can\u2019t help but feel for the Bills. Four straight Super Bowl appearances, four straight losses, and they haven\u2019t been back since.\nFlashback: Read The Dallas Morning News\u2019 story from the Cowboys\u2019 Super Bowl XVIII win here.\n1996: Super Bowl XXX in Tempe\nDallas Cowboys 27, Pittsburgh Steelers 17\nFinally. The Cowboys get one over on the hated Steelers.\nOn their third try against Pittsburgh in the Big Game, Aikman put up a very Aikman line of 15-for-23 with 209 yards and a score, Smith rushed for another pair of touchdowns and the defense took over from there.\nCowboys cornerback Larry Brown, a 12th-round draft pick in 1991, became one of the unlikeliest MVPs in Super Bowl history after picking off a pair of passes in the second half that set up two Dallas touchdowns. At the time, Brown was still grieving from the loss of his infant son two months prior. He was the first cornerback to win MVP.\nIt was also the first, and only, Super Bowl Barry Switzer would win in Dallas after taking over for Jimmy Johnson, though over the years much of the credit for this championship would end up going to Johnson anyway.\nFlashback: Read The Dallas Morning News\u2019 story from the Cowboys\u2019 Super Bowl XVIII win here.\n29 years ago today: Barry Switzer won the Super Bowl.\n\u2014 The REF (@KREFsports) January 28, 2025\nThe King is one of only three coaches to win both a National Championship and a Super Bowl. pic.twitter.com/w0W8E7fTiW\nAnd that\u2019s where we leave off. The Dallas Cowboys had eight Super Bowl appearances and five wins through the first 36 years of the franchise.\nNearly 30 years later, they\u2019re still stuck on that number.\nFind more Cowboys coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

      "text": "For about 48 hours, maybe longer, the Cowboys allowed the leaked news to hover in the air. A team that makes national headlines for not closing its drapes on game day was about to make 51-year-old Brian Schottenheimer its 10th head coach, and it didn\u2019t even cause a ripple.\nThis was the biggest \u201cwho cares\u201d hire the team has ever made. In other words, this was Jerry Jones at his best, which, for Cowboys fans, generally means the worst. To him, the hiring of a head coach, which became official when the team announced the move Friday night, ranks alongside announcing last summer that Michaels is the team\u2019s official creative store sponsor.\n(No disrespect to Michaels, they have great deals on reading glasses).\nJones wasn\u2019t kidding all those years ago in Orlando, Fla., when he said 500 coaches could win a Super Bowl with Dallas\u2019 roster. In his mind, his cynical hire of Barry Switzer even proved as much two years later. The problem is that that roster \u2014 created by Jimmy Johnson and his recent college assistants \u2014 isn\u2019t here now and never will be again unless the league does away with free agency. Now Jones is simply proving that 500 coaches can\u2019t win a Super Bowl here (or make it to an NFC championship) working under the thumb of an awkward management style of his own creation.\nThis was the weakest hire Jones has made since Dave Campo was brought in essentially to be the fall guy while the team maneuvered its roster out of salary cap hell in 2000. The fundamental difference is that this team has CeeDee Lamb and Micah Parsons and it at least hopes quarterback Dak Prescott has one healthy foot planted in his prime. It does not have major salary cap issues. It has major Eagles and Commanders issues within its division, and after five years of Mike McCarthy, it was decided \u2014 by Jones \u2014 that the club could not commit to remaining on that course he had plotted. And so the way to solve that is to promote McCarthy\u2019s longtime buddy and assistant who didn\u2019t even call the plays?\nDoes anyone still think the Cowboys\u2019 logo can\u2019t be found in the dictionary next to the word \u201cunserious?\u201d\nLet me say this about Schottenheimer. He has never been a head coach so we don\u2019t know with any certainty how he will do. Surprises happen. Sure things sometimes turn out terribly (Urban Meyer in Jacksonville?) and a two-time retread like Pete Carroll can suddenly find his Super Bowl mojo in his 60s in Seattle. There are no guarantees either way with Ben Johnson in Chicago or Mike Vrabel in New England or even Carroll (74 in September) in Vegas or the son of Marty Schottenheimer right here in Dallas.\nHaving said that, this is a disingenuous hire on its surface. After meeting and haggling with McCarthy for a week before cutting him loose, Jones wants to put Cowboys fans on notice that the problem here was McCarthy all along. We are to assume Schottenheimer has the brilliant, imaginative offensive schemes to set Dak free and McCarthy was simply holding him back, refusing to implement them?\nAnyone really buying that?\nOn top of that, I don\u2019t believe Schottenheimer has been approached for an NFL head coaching position since Buffalo showed interested in 2010 and he declined. That\u2019s when he served as offensive coordinator under Rex Ryan with the Jets \u2014 a lifetime ago in terms of NFL coaching moves. Apparently, among 32 teams, only the Cowboys (meaning Jones) understand Schottenheimer\u2019s unlocked potential.\nThus, the Cowboys are once again going back to the \u201cthankful for the opportunity, Jerry\u201d hire that did not work with Chan Gailey or Campo. Jason Garrett isn\u2019t in this category because, as a play-calling coordinator in Dallas, he had established his bona fides to the point he was getting not just interviews but job offers before replacing Wade Phillips.\nThe Cowboys did not even participate in the hunt for Vrabel. I thought his playoff experience with a Tennessee franchise that is at the opposite end of the revenue spectrum from Dallas along with his toughness would appeal to Jones. I thought Ben Johnson, who coordinated a dynamic offense around an immobile quarterback, would provide an excellent blueprint for the Cowboys and Prescott, who was lost for the season the first time he tried to showcase his former running skills.\nJerry was too late and apparently not interested, anyway.\nKeep in mind with all of this that there is no salary cap on coaches. Denver pays Sean Payton $18 million a year and the second most popular team in Los Angeles is giving Jim Harbaugh $16 million. Those teams at least made the playoffs this year. Those owners are swinging for the fences because they can.\nThe Cowboys could pay a coach $25 million a year and the NFL could not stop them. It\u2019s not something the league has to worry about with Jones in charge. Jones has hired another coach that does not appear to rank with the young Kyle Shanahan-Sean McVay-Matt LaFleur crowd in the NFC that the Cowboys can\u2019t beat.\nAll in a day\u2019s work for Jerry. Now it\u2019s on to that next sponsor.\nTwitter/X: @TimCowlishaw\nFind more Cowboys coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

      "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 The Netflix premiere was minutes away from beginning, and the night\u2019s biggest star was still on the blue carpet. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had already done numerous interviews as he made his way toward the entrance of the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood. He had already taken plenty of photos. He spent roughly 45 minutes shaking hands and doing what stars do.\nThen, despite the urging of urgent Netflix staffers wishing to whisk him away to the show, Jones made time to speak with the local media. He had already walked the carpet and now it was time to quickly walk down memory lane.\n\u201cI relived some of those when looking at this,\u201d Jones said about the filming and viewing process of his documentary. \u201cAnd I realized just exactly what good things happened to us. I looked at the contributions of so many people and what made this thing go.\u201d\nThen he talked about one moment in particular that was a catalyst for the three Super Bowls they would win in the 1990s.\n\u201cThat Herschel Walker trade was the biggest miracle to come down the pike,\u201d Jones said, \u201cbecause it gave us the ability to cut and shoot. I took two of those picks ... and traded for Alonzo Highsmith and he never ran a down. It caused you to have a going-to-Las Vegas, throw-the-dice attitude, which you kind of need some of if you\u2019re building a team.\u201d\nFittingly, as the Netflix documentary of Jones is similarly titled, Jones needed to gamble to have success with his Cowboys.\nNow, as the team prepares for the 30th anniversary of their last Super Bowl \u2014 and their last run to the conference title game, even \u2014 it\u2019s hard to not feel like memory lane is hanging over them, too.\nFor the record: one of those Cowboys, Hall of Famer Michael Irvin, disagreed with that sentiment from the blue carpet on Monday night.\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy any of that hanging over,\u201d Irvin said.\n\u201cI remember even when I was playing people would ask that same question about the \u201970s. I don\u2019t subscribe to that notion ... really, we\u2019re stacking on. I just want them to stack on. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nHow the Cowboys go about doing that remains an elusive mystery. The stars of Monday\u2019s Netflix premiere did offer some clues, however.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what anybody says: there are times when we\u2019ve played football where I think this team has the talent to get to a Super Bowl,\u201d Irvin said. \u201cNow, do they have the unity? That\u2019s what they\u2019ve been missing. Hopefully they can figure that part out.\u201d\nThe Cowboys of the \u201990s did. Jones has even cited the time when the Cowboys didn\u2019t have Hall of Fame running back Emmitt Smith for two games amidst a contract negotiation and how the Cowboys still won the Super Bowl that year. He\u2019s cited it often this camp as the Cowboys deal with star pass rusher Micah Parsons, who\u2019s issued a trade request while he doesn\u2019t practice.\nWhile the teams of the \u201990s hang over the franchise, the negotiations with Parsons hold over the current team.\nThey even held over Monday\u2019s premiere to a certain extent.\nSmith said on Monday that he wanted to \u201cset the record straight\u201d about his negotiation with the Cowboys. He said it should\u2019ve never been called a \u201choldout,\u201d in his words, because he was a free agent and the Cowboys had negotiating rights of him.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest: there\u2019s not a distinct difference between the two,\u201d Smith said about the comparisons between his negotiations and the current negotiations with Parsons. \u201cI didn\u2019t sign until two games in. That\u2019s the only difference. It is what it is. I just hope Parsons get his deal done, because for me, it\u2019s more important to have all this business stuff behind so the team itself can start to do the things they came to do. They came to training camp to work on what? Coming together as a team, forging ahead as a brotherhood, building the chemistry that they need to be. All the other distractions need to be gone.\u201d\nSmith agreed that negotiations with star players can be a distraction to the rest of the locker room, too.\n\u201cThey have to answer these questions every day,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSo they have to deal with something that has nothing to do with the game of football. You see what I\u2019m saying? It\u2019s a distraction. These questions right now have nothing to do with this movie tonight. It\u2019s a distraction. It\u2019s what you want to talk about; it\u2019s not really why I\u2019m here.\u201d\nAnd plenty of people showed up on Monday for that exact reason. Plenty of former Cowboys were there. So was Al Michaels and Marshawn Lynch, among others.\nAnd of course there was the star: the titled gambler of the Cowboys. Plenty of people talked extensively about how the Cowboys became a dynasty. No one perhaps talked more and was followed around the last couple years than Jones himself.\nThere were lessons to take away about how that team came together. Perhaps no one knows that better than the current owner and general manager of that same franchise.\nFind more Cowboys coverage from The Dallas Morning News here."

      "text": "Twenty five year ago, on Jan. 17, 1993, a euphoric Jimmy Johnson rhetorically exclaimed \"How 'Bout Them Cowboys!?\" in a jubilant postgame locker room following his team's 30-20 win over the 49ers at Candlestick Park.\nThat's right. Today is the 25th anniversary of the 1992 NFC championship game, one of the greatest victories in Cowboys postseason history.\nThe victory propelled the Cowboys to Super Bowl XXVII where Dallas would win the first of three Super Bowl championships in four seasons and cement themselves as the NFL's Team of the 90s.\nThe victory over the 49ers is recalled as a \"changing of the guard\" in the NFC. The 49ers had won four Super Bowl championships: Three of them in the 1980s and one following the 1990 season. The 49ers were the NFL's Team of the 1980s, and still among the cream of the crop in the early 1990s.\nMeanwhile, the Cowboys were a talented, up-and-coming team full of young players led by a brash head coach. \"The Triplets\" -- WR Michael Irvin, RB Emmitt Smith and QB Troy Aikman -- were future Hall of Famers on offense. The defense was overshadowed by the star power on the offensive side of the ball, but finished the 1992 season with the league's top-ranked unit.\nHow much do you remember about that game? Did you know that a Cowboys defensive lineman sacked Steve Young three times in the contest? Do you remember who it was? No, it wasn't Charles Haley...not even Tony Tolbert of Jim Jeffcoat.\nWhich wide receiver caught a touchdown pass from Troy Aikman in that game? Hint, it wasn't Michael Irvin or Alvin Harper.\nWho scored the first touchdown for the Cowboys that day? No, not Emmitt (although he did score two TDs later in the game). Hmmm...I'm trying to think but I'm being distracted by distant Moose calls.\nTo help jog out collective memories, let's go back 25 years.\nHere are some Fun Facts (per the Cowboys' 5PointsBlue.com) and memories from the NFC championship game, the first of three straight championship games between the Cowboys and 49ers following the 1992, 1993 and 1994 regular seasons.\n-- In the 1992 NFC championship game, the teams were so evenly matched, the Cowboys' offense gained 416 yards and the 49ers gained 415! The final score was more lopsided: Cowboys 30, 49ers 20.\n-- The difference in the game was takeaways by the Cowboys. Fullback Daryl Johnston recovered a fumbled punt by 49ers punt returner Alan Grant that was forced by linebacker Dixon Edwards. The recovery set up the Cowboys' first score of the day, a Lin Elliott 20-yard field goal in the first quarter to give the Cowboys a 3-0 lead.\nThe next takeaway was by Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith who recovered a fumble by 49ers running back Ricky Watters. After the takeaway, the Cowboys' offense drove for a score that was capped by an Emmitt Smith 5-yard touchdown run in the second quarter.\nLinebacker Ken Norton Jr. and safety James Washington each recorded an interception in the fourth quarter to thwart 49ers' rallies. Washington's pickoff occurred on the final play before the Two Minute Warning.\n-- The 49ers should have scored first: Future Hall of Fame receiver Jerry Rice caught an apparent 63-yard touchdown pass on the 49ers' first offensive possession, but the score was negated by a holding penalty on offensive lineman Guy McIntyre. The 49ers had to punt rather than kick an extra point.\n-- 49ers torch passed from \"Joe Cool\" to Steve Young: Future Hall of Fame QB Joe Montana watched this game from the sideline. A year earlier, an elbow injury sidelined him for the 1991 season and Steve Young had taken over as starting QB.\nYoung was nearly traded early in the 1992 season to the Raiders, but Montana's elbow injury was not yet fully healed. Good thing the 49ers didn't trade Young. He was amazing in 1992 and won NFL MVP. It was his first Pro Bowl season. It was also his first season to work with new 49ers offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan who played to Young's strengths and utilized his running skills.\n-- Young could not escape the grip of Tony Casillas: Young was fast and elusive, but he couldn't escape from Tony Casillas who recorded 3 sacks in the game. Defensive tackles like Casillas normally do the dirty work and don't get a lot of glory. Known more as a run-stopper, Casillas was a force as a pass rusher in this game and recorded all three of the Cowboys' sacks.\n-- Aikman & Young, two Pro Bowl QBs, battled it out: Young scored the first 49ers touchdown of the day on a 1-yard QB sneak in the first quarter. Young finished the game with 313 passing yards, his touchdown run, plus a touchdown pass to Jerry Rice. But he also threw the two interceptions which lowered his passer rating to 84.6. Meanwhile, Aikman protected the football. He finished with 322 passing yards, two touchdown passes, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 120.0.\n-- Troy Aikman put up great numbers, but was harassed all day: Aikman was sacked even more times (4) than Steve Young (3).\n-- K-Mart Was Open! That would be K-Mart, the wide receiver, not the store. Kelvin Martin was Cowboys a backup wide receiver who caught a 6-yard touchdown pass from Aikman in the fourth quarter to help seal the win. It was Martin's one-and-only catch of the day, but he sure made it count! Starting wide receivers Alvin Harper and Michael Irvin finished with 117 and 86 yards, respectively. Tight end Jay Novacek caught three passes for 28 yards.\n-- The Moose was loose: Fullback Daryl \"Moose\" Johnston carried only twice for 7 rushing yards and caught four passes for 26 receiving yards, but one of his rushes was a 4-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. It put the Cowboys up by a score of 17-10.\n-- Smith was a dual-threat: In addition to Smith's 5-yard touchdown run in the second quarter, he also caught a 16-yard touchdown pass from Aikman. Smith finished the day with 24 carries, 114 rushing yards, 1 rushing touchdown, 7 catches, 59 receiving yards, 1 touchdown reception.\n-- Kicker Lin Elliott missed twice: Elliott not only missed a field goal attempt (he was 1 of 2 for the game), he also missed the extra point after Smith's fourth-quarter touchdown reception. 49ers kicker Mike Cofer also missed a field goal attempt. He finished 2 of 3 on field goals and 2 for 2 on extra points.\n-- The head coaches were Jimmy Johnson (Cowboys) and George Seifert (49ers).\n-- The Cowboys' starting offense featured six players elected to the Pro Bowl (noted in bold): QB Troy Aikman, RB Emmitt Smith, FB Daryl Johnston, WRs Michael Irvin and Alvin Harper, TE Jay Novacek, LT Mark Tuinei, LG Nate Newton, C Mark Stepnoski, RG John Gesek, and RT Erik Williams.\n-- The Cowboys' starting defense was the top-ranked during the NFL 1992 regular season: DE Tony Tolbert, DT Tony Casillas, DT Russell Maryland, DE Charles Haley, LBs Ken Norton Jr., Robert Jones and Vinson Smith, CBs Kevin Smith and Larry Brown, and safeties Thomas Everett and James Washington.\n-- Future Hall of Fame pass rusher Charles Haley Was Playing Against His Old Team: Defensive end Charles Haley started the 1992 season with the 49ers, but ended it as a member of the Cowboys. Haley was traded from San Francisco to Dallas on Aug. 26th, 1992, in exchange for a second-round pick in 1993 (used by the 49ers to select Vincent Brisby) and a third-round pick in 1994 (used to select Alai Kalaniuvalu).\n-- The game was broadcast on CBS with Pat Summerall and John Madden on the call.\n-- Two weeks after beating the 49ers in San Francisco, the Cowboys returned to California, this time Pasadena, to the site of Super Bowl XXVII. The Cowboys would go on to defeat the Buffalo Bills for the first of three Super Bowl titles in a four-year period."
