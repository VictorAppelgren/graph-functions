No injuries were reported.",

      "text": "Israel has carried out its first strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen since the Israel-Iran ceasefire, attacking ports and a power plant around midnight local time Sunday night into Monday morning.\nThe strikes come after at least three Houthi ballistic missiles were launched at Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), including one missile that was intercepted Saturday.\nThe Iran-backed Houthis also claimed responsibility for an attack on the bulk carrier \u2018Magic Seas\u2019 in the Red Sea on Sunday, the first on commercial shipping in the region by the rebels this year.\nIsrael struck the ports of Hodeida, Ras Isa, Salif and the Ras Kanatib power plant along the Red Sea. The IDF also hit the Galaxy Leader, a cargo ship seized by the Houthis in November 2023.\n\u201cHouthi forces installed a radar system on the ship and have been using it to track vessels in the international maritime arena to facilitate further terrorist activities,\u201d the IDF said in a statement following the strikes.\nA short time before the wave of attacks, the IDF\u2019s Arabic language spokesman, Avichay Adraee, issued an evacuation warning for the ports and the power station.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz said the strikes were part of the newly named Operation \u201cBlack Flag.\u201d In a statement on social media, Katz said, \u201cThe Houthis will continue to pay a heavy price for their actions\u201d and promised more attacks would follow if the Houthis kept launching drones and ballistic missiles at Israel.\nThe Houthi military confirmed the strikes but said, \u201cYemeni air defenses effectively confronted the Israeli aggression,\u201d using, \u201ca massive barrage of locally manufactured surface-to-air missiles,\u201d in a short statement on early Monday morning.\nThere are no immediate reports of casualties from the strikes.\nHouthi political bureau member Mohammed Al Farah said targeting Yemeni ports, power stations, and other \u201ccivilian facilities is an attempt to harm civilians and has no connection to any military activity,\u201d according to the Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV.\nSince Israel\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza started in October 2023, the country has come under fire from missiles and rockets from Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, who claim to strike Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians.\nOn Sunday, the Houthis attacked the \u2018Magic Seas\u2019 ship, claiming that the its owner had used Israeli ports.\nThe rebels said they had struck the vessel with unmanned boats, missiles and drones, and it had now sunk. They have warned that they will target shipping that uses ports in Israel, which they describe as \u201coccupied Palestine.\u201d\nThe vessel\u2019s operator \u2013 Stem Shipping \u2013 told Reuters that the \u2018Magic Seas\u2019 had made a port call to Israel in the past, but the latest transit of the region appeared low-risk as it had nothing to do with Israel.\nThe \u2018Magic Seas\u2019 crew of 19 left the boat on Sunday and were being taken by another ship to Djibouti.\nThe United Arab Emirates foreign ministry said an Emirati operation rescued everyone aboard the ship, in close coordination with organizations like the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO). A vessel responded to a distress call from the \u2018Magic Seas\u2019 after it came under attack and sustained \u201cdamage\u201d to its structure, causing its crew to abandon ship under \u201cdifficult maritime conditions\u201d the ministry said.\nIn May, the Houthi group \u2013 which controls much of northern and central Yemen \u2013 agreed to halt attacks on US warships in the Red Sea after more than a month of airstrikes by US forces on its strongholds and missile infrastructure.\nBut it did not pledge to end attacks on other shipping with alleged connections to Israel and has continued to fire ballistic missiles at Israel in support of the Palestinian population in Gaza.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

  "argos_summary": "Israel launched airstrikes on Yemen\u2019s Houthi targets, hitting a military site near the presidential palace, two power plants, a fuel storage site, and several ports along the Red Sea, in retaliation for a new missile type fired at Israel. The strikes were part of Operation \u201cBlack Flag\u201d and involved more than 10 fighter jets, with the furthest target about 2,000\u202fkm away. The Houthis vowed continued support for Gaza and claimed to have intercepted Israeli aggression with surface\u2011to\u2011air missiles, while also attacking the bulk carrier \u201cMagic Seas\u201d in the Red Sea. No casualties were reported from the Israeli strikes, but the Houthis warned that they would keep targeting shipping linked to Israel. The incident underscores the broader escalation between Israel and Iran\u2011backed groups amid the Gaza conflict.",
