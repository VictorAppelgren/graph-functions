      "summary": "The Washington, D.C. police chief has initiated increased cooperation with federal immigration officials, allowing officers to share information and transport immigration agents, which marks a significant shift from the district's previous policy against such collaboration. This change comes amid heightened federal law enforcement presence in the city, as President Trump deploys National Guard troops to assist with crime control and public safety. Mayor Muriel Bowser has expressed concern over the federal takeover of local law enforcement but is attempting to navigate the situation pragmatically, suggesting that the increased federal resources could benefit public safety despite the unsettling nature of the intervention.",
