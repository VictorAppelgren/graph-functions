  "content": "SINGAPORE, Aug 29 (Reuters) - The dollar wobbled on Friday, poised for a 2% drop in August against major currencies on rising odds of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates next month while worries about the threats to the U.S. central bank's independence linger.\n\nPresident Donald Trump 's campaign to exert more influence over monetary policy, including attempts to fire Lisa Cook, one of the Fed's governors, has weighed on the dollar. Cook filed a lawsuit claiming Trump has no power to remove her from office.\n\nThe legal battle is the latest chapter in Trump's attempts to reshape the central bank after repeatedly criticising the Fed and its Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates.\n\n\"If markets perceive the FOMC\u2019s independence as compromised, inflation expectations could become unanchored, driving long-term interest rates higher,\" said Carol Kong, currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n\nCurrency markets were tentative on Friday, with the euro easing a bit to $1.16625, but on course for a 2% gain in August. Sterling last bought $1.3509 and the Japanese yen fetched 147.01 per dollar.\n\nThe Australian dollar was steady at $0.6533, set for a 1.6% gain in the month, while China's yuan hit its strongest level in 10 months against the dollar as steady central bank fixings and a hot domestic stock market drive the currency higher.\n\nThe dollar index , which measures the U.S. currency against six major peers, was at 97.917, on course for a 2% decline for the month. The index is down nearly 10% this year as erratic U.S. trade policies drove investors towards alternative assets.\n\nTrump's push to place hand-picked, dovish-leaning candidates on the central bank's decision-making committee has pressured short-term yields lower, while longer-term yields have risen.\n\n\"While President Trump may be able to lower the Fed Funds rate by influencing the makeup of the interest rate setting committee, longer-term interest rates may not respond in kind,\" said CBA's Kong.\n\nA politically influenced Fed that keeps interest rates lower than it otherwise might could result in higher inflation and reduce foreign demand for the debt due to credibility fears, while a worsening fiscal outlook is also expected to weigh on longer-dated bonds.\n\nThe yield curve differential between two-year and 10-year notes was last at 57 basis points, after hitting the steepest level since April earlier in the week.\n\nStill, market reaction to the battle between Trump and the Fed's Cook has been relatively muted, with slight dollar selling and curve steepening.\n\n\"The market is looking through the amplified theatre and noise with regard to the robust opinions circulating regarding the independence of the US Fed,\" said George Boubouras, head of research at K2 Asset Management.\n\n\"The market is not complacent about these developments, it is simply being pragmatic.\"\n\nFed Governor Christopher Waller said on Thursday he wants to start cutting rates next month and \"fully expects\" more rate cuts to follow to bring the central bank's policy rate closer to a neutral setting.\n\nMarkets are currently pricing in an 86% chance of a rate cut in September, up from 63% a month earlier, CME FedWatch showed. Traders are wagering on more than 100 basis points of easing by June next year.\n\nData on Thursday showed the U.S. economy grew faster than initially thought in the second quarter, but tariffs on imports continued to cloud the picture.\n\nInvestors will parse through the PCE price index report, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, later on Friday. On a year-over-year basis, headline PCE inflation is estimated at 2.6%, after rising at the same rate in June.\n\nWhile a reading of 3% or higher will raise eyebrows after the Fed\u2019s dovish pivot, the key data remains next Friday\u2019s labour market report ahead of the September FOMC meeting, said Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG.",

      "text": "The Trust Principles\nThomson Reuters is dedicated to upholding the Trust Principles and to preserving its independence, integrity, and freedom from bias in the gathering and dissemination of information and news.\nTrust Principles \u2013 the history\nThe Trust Principles were created in 1941, in the midst of World War II, in agreement with The Newspaper Proprietors Association Limited and The Press Association Limited (being the Reuters shareholders at that time). The Trust Principles imposed obligations on Reuters and its employees to act at all times with integrity, independence, and freedom from bias.\nReuters Directors and shareholders were determined to protect and preserve the Trust Principles when Reuters became a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A unique structure was put in place to achieve this. A new company was formed and given the name 'Reuters Founders Share Company Limited', its purpose being to hold a 'Founders Share' in Reuters.\nThe legal structure has evolved over time and the Founders Share and other contractual arrangements now confer a number of special rights upon the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company. For example, (i) the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company has enhanced voting rights in circumstances where someone is seeking to obtain a significant shareholding in, or acquire control of, Thomson Reuters and (ii) the prior consent of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company must be sought prior to undertaking any sale of, or other material transaction involving, the Reuters news business unit.\nThomson Reuters itself is obliged and committed to apply the Trust Principles to its operations. The charter documents of Thomson Reuters Corporation include provisions to safeguard the Trust Principles as they apply to the Thomson Reuters business and require Thomson Reuters Directors, in the performance of their duties, to have due regard to the Trust Principles, by the proper exercise of their powers and in accordance with their other duties as Directors.\nThe Trust Principles are:\n- That Reuters shall at no time pass into the hands of any one interest, group, or faction;\n- That the integrity, independence, and freedom from bias of Thomson Reuters shall at all times be fully preserved;\n- That Reuters shall supply unbiased and reliable news services to newspapers, news agencies, broadcasters, and other media subscribers and to businesses, governments, institutions, individuals, and others with whom Reuters has or may have contracts;\n- That Thomson Reuters shall pay due regard to the many interests which it serves in addition to those of the media; and\n- That no effort shall be spared to expand, develop, and adapt the news and other services and products of Thomson Reuters so as to maintain its leading position in the international news and information business\nThomson Reuters Founders Share Company was established in 1984 when Reuters became a public company. The directors of Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company (known as \u2018Trustees\u2019) have a duty to ensure, to the extent possible, that the Trust Principles are complied with.\nThe Trustees are experienced and eminent people from diverse arenas in politics, diplomacy, media, public service and business. The Trustees are selected by a nomination committee and proposed to the board of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company for appointment. The nomination committee assists in scrutinizing candidates\u2019 suitability and its members include two persons appointed by the chairman after consultation with the European Court of Human Rights and representatives of certain press associations. The Thomson Reuters Corporation board has two representatives on the nomination committee. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company Board are members of the nomination committee, and the Chairman appoints three other directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company as members of the nomination committee. The Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company acts as chairman of the nomination committee.\nThe number of Trustees has to be at least 14 and not more than 18. Trustees have a minimum of two meetings per year, and receive reports on our activities in the different fields in which we operate (including Reuters news). The Trustees meet with both the Thomson Reuters Board and representatives of senior management. Through Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company's Chairman, regular contact is maintained with our company. The relationship is one of trust and confidence.\nIndependence of Thomson Reuters\nCustomers across the world depend on us to provide them with reliable and objective news and information.\nThis means that we have a special need to safeguard our independence and integrity and avoid any bias which may stem from control by specific individuals or interests.\nThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles were adopted in 1941 and include the preservation of integrity, reliability of news, development of the news business, and related principles.\nToday, the Trust Principles are fundamental to our entire business.\nMore information\nContact us\nBrian Moss\nFor inquiries pertaining to Reuters reporting standards and the Trust Principles please email: brian.moss@thomsonreuters.com."
