  "title": "5 unnecessary bloatware apps you can easily delete on your Samsung Galaxy",
  "description": "Samsung Galaxy phones come with many pre-installed apps, and if you don't use these ones, it's best to uninstall them.",
  "content": "If you have a Samsung Galaxy phone, you're probably familiar with One UI, Samsung's custom Android interface. I've been using One UI 7 on the Galaxy S25+ and One UI 8 on the Z Fold 7 recently, and I've thoroughly enjoyed both experiences, as it's a refreshing change from iOS. While I appreciate One UI's extensive settings menu and deep customization options on the home screen and lock screen, one ongoing issue I've encountered on both of my new devices is the abundance of pre-installed bloatware apps.\n\nSamsung ships its phones with many preloaded apps, some of which are quite useful, like Samsung Health, which manages health data, and the Wear app, which connects your device to a smartwatch. However, the vast majority of these pre-installed Samsung apps are probably unused or unknown to most users.\n\nIf you don't use any of these apps and have no plans to use them in the future, there's little reason to keep them. Uninstalling them frees up storage, lowers background activity, and conserves memory and battery life. Here are five Samsung bloatware apps that I have uninstalled from my Galaxy devices, which you may also want to consider.\n\nIf I want to buy a new Samsung device, I'll just use its website\n\nWhenever I get a new Samsung device, the first app I uninstall is the Samsung Shop. As its name implies, it's designed for buying Samsung products, kind of like the Apple Store app on an iPhone. You can browse the latest Samsung phones, tablets, smartwatches, monitors, and more through the app, and get special deals.\n\nI've never actually used this app to buy anything, and you can easily access the same store online by visiting Samsung's website. For me, buying expensive products is better done on my PC, where I have a bigger screen, and it's easier to read about, watch videos, and make a purchase. So, the Samsung Shop app is a no-brainer for me to uninstall and free up some storage space, and you might feel the same way.\n\nIt's a useful app if you have kids, but if you don't, it's pointless\n\nNext, there's Samsung Kids. This app is useful if you have a child, as it allows you to create a safe space on your phone for your kid to play. It offers interactive apps, games, and content designed to help children develop their thinking skills. According to Samsung, the goal of the Kids app is to create a \"child-friendly zone\" on a Galaxy phone or tablet. Parents can customize the app's settings, including playtime, screen time, bedtime, and which apps within it their kids can use.\n\nWhile the app has good intentions, it's not worth keeping if you don't have a young child. I had trouble uninstalling it because it was pre-installed and didn't show up in my app drawer. I had to go to Settings > Apps > Samsung Kids and tap Uninstall at the bottom of the app's details page to remove it.\n\nIf you're not into mobile gaming, you don't need Gaming Hub\n\nWhile I'm not big on mobile gaming, I don't mind playing the occasional game on my phone from time to time. Samsung's Gaming Hub app, which comes pre-installed on all its phones, allows you to launch games you've already downloaded or play games directly through the app without needing to download them.\n\nIf you have a lot of mobile games, Gaming Hub might be useful, but since I only have a few, I don't see a need for a hub to manage them. So, it's an easy uninstall for me. If you don't play games on your phone or don't mind launching them from the app drawer, I recommend uninstalling Gaming Hub as well and reclaiming some of that precious storage space.\n\nThere are plenty of other free streaming apps I already use\n\nI'm a big fan of free, ad-supported television (FAST) streaming services, but I never watch any channels through Samsung's FAST app, called Samsung TV Plus. If you don't subscribe to streaming services like Netflix or Prime Video, Samsung TV Plus could be a useful option because it offers over 200 live TV channels to watch for free.\n\nHowever, I have a few streaming subscriptions and already use a couple of free FAST TV apps on my phone like Pluto TV and Roku, so I've never seen the need for Samsung TV Plus. If you're in a similar situation and have never used it, it's probably best to uninstall it so it doesn't unnecessarily take up space on your device.\n\nIt has good intentions, but I would rather support the causes directly\n\nFor the longest time, I'd seen the Global Goals app icon pop up in my app drawer, but I never bothered to check it out. That is, until recently, when I accidentally opened it and realized I didn't need it on my phone. Samsung's Global Goals has good intentions -- it's meant to promote sustainability efforts around the world. The app shows 17 different sustainable development goals, along with tons of information on each one. You can also donate to charities through the app or watch ads, and the ad earnings get donated to charity.\n\nAs I said, the app's purpose is honorable, and it supports a good cause. But I don't think every Samsung user wants this on their phone. Personally, I prefer to support charities directly, not through an app. If you feel the same way, it's probably worth uninstalling the Global Goals app on your phone and freeing up storage space. However, I do recommend taking a look through it before getting rid of it and learning about some of the causes it promotes.\n\nYou can easily reinstall any of these apps\n\nIf you choose to delete any of the apps mentioned in this story and want them back later, it's simple to do. Just open the Galaxy Store on your Samsung device and search for the app. You should be able to find it easily and redownload it if you'd like.",

      "text": "Summary\n- Samsung is expanding its free sports offerings on Samsung TV Plus with five new channels.\n- The Roku Sports Channel, NASCAR, PBR RidePass, and more, are now available on Samsung TV Plus.\n- Samsung TV Plus now has over 50 FAST channels, allowing sports fans to watch select live games, recaps, talk shows, and other content for free.\nIf you own a Samsung smart TV, you can now access a broader range of sports content for free, courtesy of the latest update to Samsung TV Plus.\nSamsung has announced the expansion of its sports content lineup on Samsung TV Plus, introducing five new channels. These channels feature NHL games from Dallas and Anaheim, the Roku Sports Channel, NASCAR, and PBR RidePass.\n\"We're tearing down the paywalls that have kept fans from the sports they love,\" said Salek Brodsky, Global Head of Samsung TV Plus, in a press release. \"By teaming up with top leagues and bringing live games and iconic moments to our platform, we're giving every fan a front-row seat.\"\nSamsung TV Plus\nYou can download the Samsung TV Plus app from the Samsung Galaxy Store app on your device.\nWhat is Samsung TV Plus?\nIt has over 50 FAST channels available to stream\nIf you're unfamiliar with Samsung TV Plus, it's the company's FAST (free ad-supported television) offering. The app is available exclusively on Samsung devices, including its smart TVs, Galaxy smartphones, Smart Monitors, and the Family Hub appliance lineup (aka its refrigerators).\nThe biggest addition to Samsung TV Plus with this update is undoubtedly the Roku Sports Channel, as it offers a lot of great sports content, such as live MLB games, Formula E races, and sports talk shows. The NASCAR channel is another great addition, featuring the latest racing news and original programming. The PBR RidePass stands out, as it includes professional bull riding content from the PBR (Professional Bull Riders), showcasing events like the Unleash The Beast Tour, PBR Team Series, Ultimate Bull Fighting, and much more.\nIf you live in Anaheim or Dallas, this update to Samsung TV Plus will also allow you to catch live games from your local NHL teams starting in the 2025-26 season. If you're in Anaheim, the Victory+ Anaheim channel lets you stream live Anaheim Ducks games, and if you're in Dallas, Victory+ Dallas lets you stream live Dallas Stars games. Both channels feature additional programming beyond live games, such as highlights and recaps.\nThese new channels join Samsung's growing FAST channel offerings, with over 50 channels now available on Samsung TV Plus to watch. Some highlights include the NFL Channel, MLB, FIFA+, Formula 1 Channel, PGA TOUR, and UFC. Samsung TV Plus might not be the largest FAST app, especially compared to Pluto TV or the Roku Channel, but in a world where sports streaming is becoming increasingly popular, it's certainly on the right track. Samsung is also teasing \"more exciting additions\" to Samsung TV Plus later this year."

      "text": "Summary\n- Samsung Galaxy devices have a bunch of useful settings hidden away in their menus, like lift to wake, which wakes your phone when you pick it up.\n- You can also customize what happens when you double-press the side button, like setting it to launch your favorite app.\n- Adaptive battery protection safeguards your phone's battery, and Samsung's Good Lock app unlocks a plethora of additional customization options.\nThe settings menus on our phones today are filled with many useful features. With so many options to browse, it's easy to overlook some of the hidden gems that can significantly improve your experience with your device. This is especially true for Samsung Galaxy phones, which offer a wide range of settings to explore and test thanks to One UI, whether you have a standard model or a foldable.\nIf you have a Samsung Galaxy device and want to enhance your experience with minimal effort, consider checking out these six settings. I've been using them on my Galaxy S25+ (with One UI 7) and while testing the Fold 7 (with One UI 8), and they've made using both devices more enjoyable.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\n- Brand\n- Samsung\n- SoC\n- Snapdragon 8 Elite\n- Display\n- 6.5-inch 120Hz 2520 x 1080 Dynamic AMOLED 2X Cover Display, 8-inch 120Hz 2184 x 1968 Dynamic OLED 2X Main Display\n- RAM\n- 12GB\nSamsung's next-generation Galaxy Z Fold 7 is its thinnest and lightest foldable yet.\n- Storage\n- 256GB, 512GB, 1TB\n- Battery\n- 4,400mAh\n1 Wake your phone by simply picking it up\nNo more tapping the screen to wake it\nThis is a handy setting that makes it easier to pick up your device to unlock it or check your notifications. It's called Lift to wake, and as the name suggests, when you enable it, it detects when you pick your phone up and turns on the screen. Usually, when you pick up your Galaxy phone, you have to tap the screen to wake it or press the power button. However, this setting does it instantly. If you don't use Always on Display, this setting is even more helpful, allowing you to see your screen exactly when you need it. You can find it under Settings > Advanced Features > Motions and gestures > Lift to wake.\n2 Customize the side button's double-press action\nYou can double-tap the side button to open your favorite app\nThis is another setting you can find under Advanced Features on your Galaxy phone, allowing you to customize the action that occurs when you double-tap the side button (also known as the power button) on your device. By default, it's set to the camera app, but you can change it to open any other app on your device, such as Google Messages, YouTube, Spotify, or any other app you prefer. I have mine set to open Google Wallet, which makes it easier to access any of my cards when I need them quickly. To customize this setting on your device, head to Settings > Advanced Features > Side button > Double press. Additionally, under the same side button menu, you can customize what happens when you long-press it. However, there aren't as many options, as it's limited to selecting a digital assistant, Bixby, or the Power off menu.\n3 Enable Adaptive Battery Protection\nProlong your battery's lifespan\nI've been enjoying using my Galaxy S25+ since I got it at launch, and I want to do everything I can to make it last as long as possible. That's why I enabled a feature called Adaptive Battery protection in Settings. This feature prevents your phone's battery from charging past 80 percent while you're sleeping and then charges it back to 100 percent just before you wake up. It achieves this by learning your usage habits. So, if you usually stop using your phone around 10pm and wake up at 6am, it recognizes this and adjusts it's charging accordingly. The goal of this feature is to improve your phone's battery health and extend its lifespan. To activate it, go to Settings > Battery > Battery protection > Adaptive. By default, battery protection is set to Basic. There's also another option called Maximum, which stops charging your battery once it reaches 80 percent.\n4 Get rid of the Edge Panel\nIf you don't use it, you can hide it\nIf you don't use the Edge Panel on your Samsung phone to access Galaxy AI features or apps, removing it can improve your screen's appearance. If you're unfamiliar with the Edge Panel, it is the small, transparent tab you see in the upper right corner of your screen. Tapping it opens the Edge Panel, where you can access Galaxy AI features such as AI Select, Now Brief, Drawing Assist, and more, along with app shortcuts. I never use the Edge Panel, so having the tab constantly visible in the corner can be distracting. If you don't use it either, it's worth hiding. To do this, go to Settings > Display > Edge panels and toggle it off.\n5 Access secret Wi-Fi settings\nSamsung has a hidden menu called Connectivity Labs\nWhile Samsung's devices already offer a variety of Wi-Fi settings, did you know that they also have an entire menu that is secretly hidden away, allowing you to test your Wi-Fi's connectivity and access additional settings? The menu is called Connectivity Labs, and can be found under Settings > Connections > Intelligent Wi-Fi > Connectivity Labs. However, when you first attempt to access it, the option won't be available. This is because you have to manually unlock Connectivity Labs by tapping the Intelligent Wi-Fi button five times. Once you've done this, it will magically appear as a menu to access.\nIn Connectivity Labs, there are several handy features, including a Home Wi-Fi Inspection tool that allows you to test the signal strength of your home's Wi-Fi. Another setting is called Switching to mobile data faster, which, as the name suggests, enables your phone to switch to mobile data more quickly if it detects an insufficient Wi-Fi signal. You can read more about Samsung's Connectivity Labs here.\n6 Download the Good Lock app\nSamsung's Good Lock app offers different modules to customize your device\nGood Lock\nSamsung's Good Lock unlocks additional customization features on Galaxy devices.\nFinally, if you want to enhance your experience with your Galaxy device further, downloading Samsung's Good Lock app is a great place to start. It's not really a secret, but it's definitely a hidden gem. The app lets you download modules to customize parts of the user interface, such as ClockFace, which lets you modify the clock on the Always On Display/lock screen, and Theme Park, which enables you to create your own custom theme. Overall, there are more than 15 different modules to explore, giving you the ability to tailor the experience on your Galaxy device to your preferences.\nMy favorite module in the Good Lock app is RegiStar, which allows you to customize the settings menu and add extra gestures. One of these is a back-tap action, which lets you double-tap or triple-tap the back of your phone to perform a specific action, like opening an app. I have it set so that double-tapping the back of my phone opens the camera app."

      "text": "Summary\n- The easiest way to try out One UI 8 early is to download the beta, if your device is eligible.\n- A more costly way to get your hands on One UI 8 is to get one of Samsung's newest foldable devices, the Fold 7, Flip 7 or Flip 7 FE.\n- The Galaxy S25 FE is rumored to launch in September with One UI 8, so that's another way to get it likely before S24 or S23 users.\nSamsung unveiled One UI 8 earlier this year, and since then, it has been gradually rolling it out to an increasing number of users through its beta program. If you're unfamiliar with One UI 8, it's Samsung's Android 16 update for its Galaxy smartphones. While One UI 7 (Samsung's Android 15 update) had a lengthy rollout period marred by issues, so far it appears that One UI 8 won't share the same fate (hopefully), with September already announced as the launch date.\nOne UI 8 has been in beta for the past couple of months, and an official stable version was launched on Samsung's newest foldable devices, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7, which came out in July. If you're excited about One UI 8 and want to get it faster, here are three ways to be one of the first.\nGalaxy Z Fold 7\n- Brand\n- Samsung\n- SoC\n- Snapdragon 8 Elite\n- Display\n- 6.5-inch 120Hz 2520 x 1080 Dynamic AMOLED 2X Cover Display, 8-inch 120Hz 2184 x 1968 Dynamic OLED 2X Main Display\n- RAM\n- 12GB\nSamsung's next-generation Galaxy Z Fold 7 is its thinnest and lightest foldable yet.\n1 Join the One UI 8 beta program\nThe cheapest and simplest option if your device qualifies\nIf you have a Galaxy S25 or S24 series device, the beta is undoubtedly the easiest way to try out One UI 8 now, before its official launch. Samsung started the beta program for One UI 8 on the Galaxy S25 series in May and recently began rolling it out to the Galaxy S24 series, with the beta now available for download in the US, UK, Korea, and India.\nAlso, if you have a Galaxy Z Fold 6 or Z Flip 6, you can download and try the beta as well. Unfortunately, if you own a Galaxy S23 series device, Fold 5, or Flip 5, Samsung won't roll out the One UI 8 beta for them until September, so you'll need to wait a bit longer.\nTo sign up and download the beta on your eligible device, just follow these simple steps:\n1. Open the Samsung Members app (you can get it from the Galaxy Store if you uninstalled it).\n2. Log in to the app with your Samsung account if you haven't already done so.\n3. Tap the One UI Beta Program banner at the top of the screen to enroll in the beta.\n4. Once you've enrolled, head to Settings > Software update > Download and install to check for updates and download the One UI 8 beta.\nIt's recommended you back up your device before installing the beta.\n2 Give Samsung's latest foldable models a try\nIt's not the cheapest route, but it's still a way to get One UI 8\nIf you don't want the One UI 8 beta or your device isn't eligible, and you're eager to try an official release of One UI 8, the only option currently is to get one of Samsung's latest foldable devices. When Samsung announced the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7, one of the key benefits it highlighted was that these new foldable phones come with a stable version of One UI 8 pre-installed out of the box.\nSo, if you've been waiting to upgrade your device or just have $2,000 to spend on a Galaxy Z Fold 7, this is currently the only way to experience an official, non-beta version of One UI 8 until Samsung begins rolling out the official update in September. While it's certainly not the easiest or cheapest option available, it's still a way to experience One UI 8 before anyone else and get the update faster. On the bright side, if you do choose to go down this route and get one of Samsung's new foldables, both the Fold 7 and Flip 7 have some pretty big upgrades, which make them worth the cost if you're coming from a much older device.\nAdditionally, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE also comes with One UI 8, making it one of the cheapest ways to officially get the update now, as the phone costs $900, which is more affordable than the Flip 7's $1,100 price tag.\n3 Get the Galaxy S25 FE\nLeaks suggest it will launch in September\nAn alternative way to get One UI 8 sooner is by waiting for the Galaxy S25 FE. Although Samsung hasn't officially announced it yet, leaks indicate it will launch in late September with One UI 8 pre-installed, like the Fold 7 and Flip 7.\nFor those unfamiliar, Samsung's FE series offers more affordable versions of its flagship phones released earlier in the year. For example, last year's Galaxy S24 FE was a simplified version of the S24, featuring a slower chipset (Exynos S2400E instead of Snapdragon 8 Gen 3), slightly inferior cameras, and slower charging. The S25 FE is expected to follow the same pattern, being a more budget-friendly variant of the S25.\nIf you own an older Samsung Galaxy phone and prefer not to pay for the S25, S25+, S25 Ultra, or the new foldables, waiting for the S25 FE could be a good option. It\u2019s likely you'll receive One UI 8 earlier if it launches in September, as the S24 and S23 series may not be updated until after its release. FNN News, a South Korean news outlet, reported that the S25 FE could be launched on September 19 in Korea, which means the US launch could be the same day or follow soon after. For reference, the Galaxy S24 FE launched last year for $650, so the S25 FE could be around the same price range.\n4 Play the waiting game\nThis isn't exactly a faster way to get it\nLastly, this isn't exactly a faster way to get One UI 8, but it's really the only other option to try it out eventually: playing the waiting game.\nSamsung has already said that One UI 8 will officially launch in September, first rolling out to the Galaxy S25 series. It didn't share an exact date of when to expect it for the Galaxy S24 series or the Galaxy S23 series, but it did say it \"will be rolled out sequentially to other eligible devices.\" Therefore, it's possible that other Galaxy devices could receive the update in late September or October.\nHere's a list of the Samsung Galaxy smartphones expected to support One UI 8:\nGalaxy S Series\n- Galaxy S25, S25+ S25 Ultra, S25 Edge\n- Galaxy S24, S24+, S24 Ultra, S24 FE\n- Galaxy S23, S23+, S23 Ultra, S23 FE\n- Galaxy S22, S22+, S22 Ultra\n- Galaxy S21 FE\nGalaxy Z Series\n- Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7, Z Flip 7 FE\n- Galaxy Z Fold 6, Z Flip 6\n- Galaxy Z Fold 5, Z Flip 5\n- Galaxy Z Fold 4, Z Flip 4\nA bunch of Samsung's mid-range devices are also expected to get the One UI 8 update, including the Galaxy A33, A53, A73, A24, A34, A54, A15, A25, A35, and A55. Samsung has not officially confirmed all the devices getting One UI 8 yet, but these devices are the most likely to get it at the present time."

      "text": "Summary\n- While the rollout of One UI 7 has been bumpy, it's well worth the wait for the new widget and home screen customization options.\n- One of my favorite new features is the Now Bar, which displays live activities, like Spotify, on your phone's lock screen.\n- Notifications and quick settings are now separated into two distinct menus on One UI 7.\nThe release of One UI 7 has been anything but smooth for Samsung. After beginning to roll out the update on April 10 in the US, the tech giant paused it only a few short days later to address a serious bug.\nNow, over a week later, Samsung has finally resumed the rollout, allowing users to start downloading One UI 7 again on eligible devices, beginning with the Galaxy S24 series and the latest Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip models. More devices, such as the S23 series, will receive it soon.\nWhile the wait for One UI 7 has been long, the features it's been packed with are well worth the wait. I've been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to test One UI 7 on the Galaxy S25+ for a few months now, and here are five of my favorite features that made me not miss my iPhone, and that you should try out once you receive the update on your Galaxy device.\nSamsung Galaxy S25+\n- Brand\n- Samsung\n- SoC\n- Snapdragon 8 Elite\n- Display\n- 6.7-inch\n- RAM\n- 12GB\n- Storage\n- 256GB, 512GB\n- Battery\n- 4,900mAh\n5 New widget options\nYou now add a countdown widget to your home screen/app pages\nIf you enjoy customizing your phone screen with various widgets, you'll love the new widget options Samsung has introduced with One UI 7. For starters, Samsung has added three new widget size options for its default apps, such as Calendar, Clock, Weather, and more, allowing you to adjust their size to your preference. Once you place the widget, you can drag its corners to resize it.\nAnother new widget feature is the option to customize its shape, which means your widgets no longer have to resemble rounded rectangles and squares; you can add a bit of flair if you wish. Simply tap the widget, select settings, and you'll see all the different shape options available.\nMy favorite new widget option is the countdown feature for Calendar, which allows you to add an event to the Calendar widget that counts down to specific occasions, such as birthdays, holidays, and special events. For instance, I created a countdown widget that tracked the days until the Andor season two premiere.\n4 Now Bar\nYou view live activities on your lock screen\nOne of the first new things you'll notice immediately with One UI 7 is the Now Bar. It's a new pill-shaped widget on the lock screen that displays all the live activities happening on your phone. For example, if you're playing a song on Spotify, it will be displayed in the Now Bar, allowing you to pause playback, navigate backward, or forward in your playlist, all without needing to unlock your phone or open the app.\nWhat I like most about the Now Bar is its placement. It's located right at the bottom of the lock screen, making it super easy to access, especially when you're using your phone with one hand. If you tap on any of the live activities, you can expand them to see more options available. It also supports Google Sports, so if you follow any sports teams on Google, the scores of their games will be displayed in the Now Bar. If you're watching the Stanley Cup Playoffs right now (go Leafs), this is a must. Some of the apps that support the Now Bar are Spotify, YouTube Music, Google Maps, Clock, Voice Recorder, Samsung Notes, Live Interpreter, and Samsung Health. More third-party apps are expected to support the Now Bar in the future.\n3 New quick settings menu\nQuick settings and notifications have been separated\nWith One UI 7, Samsung has adopted a notably Apple-like approach to the notification center and quick settings menu, splitting them into two distinct menus. Previously, when you swiped down from the top of the screen, you'd be greeted with quick settings options and notifications. Now, with One UI 7, when you swipe down from the top-left or middle of the screen, you only see notifications. However, when you swipe down from the top-right, you access the quick settings menu, allowing you to adjust your Wi-Fi settings, activate Airplane mode, turn on the flashlight, and more.\nI appreciate this change, as I find myself rarely using the options in the quick settings menu unless I'm traveling or changing my screen brightness. Having one screen entirely dedicated to notifications is much more convenient, making it feel more like iOS 18, which I'm accustomed to coming from my iPhone. Samsung has also made additional changes to the quick settings menu, allowing you to add more settings and rearrange the panels on the screen.\nIf you prefer the old style, where quick settings and notifications are combined into one screen, you can change it back by opening the Quick Settings menu, tapping the pencil icon, selecting Panel Settings, and choosing the Together option rather than Separate.\n2 Lock screen customization\nYou can adjust the Clock widget more freely now\nThe lock screen is also receiving some love with One UI 7, featuring new customization options that can make yours even more unique and personalized. You can now add a gallery widget to the lock screen, allowing you to display images from your phone's gallery on it. So if you want a picture of your annoying but adorable cat on your lock screen at all times, you can now do that. You can even add PNGs to the lock screen's gallery widget, so the images will be transparent and blend in better with your lock screen's background.\nMy favorite new lock screen addition with One UI 7 is the ability to move the clock face around even more freely. This feature is available in One UI 6, but One UI 7 introduces many more options, allowing you to adjust and scale the clock to match your phone's lock screen background much better. Samsung has also added a new thickness option that lets you modify the thickness of the clock's font, along with new animated clock style options. If you remember that countdown widget for the home screen I mentioned earlier, you can also add it to the lock screen for any events you're excited for.\n1 Home screen upgrades\nNew app icons and sizes\nWith One UI 7, Samsung has updated all its default app icons with fresh appearances that make them stand out and look more modern overall. But that's not all Samsung has done with app icons. If you go to the Settings app and select Home screen, you can now change the size of all your app icons. You can choose between small, medium, and large icons, with the default setting set to medium.\nTwo other new settings have been added to further customize the home screen: the ability to turn off app labels and widget labels. This means that if you no longer want to see the names of apps under their icons, you can disable them. The result is a super-clean, minimalistic look for all your apps on the home screen and different app pages.\nAdditionally, you can now enlarge the size of app folders, enabling you to access apps within them without needing to open the folders themselves. This is game-changing and something I hope Apple adopts for iOS in the future. The App Drawer has also undergone some modifications, with Samsung relocating the search bar from the top of the screen to the bottom for better usability. Further, it's now possible to view apps in the App Drawer vertically instead of horizontally by adjusting the sort option to Alphabetical.\nThere are a couple of other honorable mentions I want to give for other new One UI 7 features, including the redesigned camera app and new battery protection modes."
