  "description": "TAG Immobilien Swings to Net Profit Due to Strength of Rental Business in Germany, Poland",
  "content": "TAG Immobilien swung to net profit in the first half of the year on a strong performance of its rental business in Germany and Poland.\n\nThe MDAX-listed real-estate company on Tuesday posted a net profit of 151.1 million euros ($175.5 million) for the six-month period compared with a net loss of 7.1 million euros in the same period of last year.\n\n\"TAG got off to a very good start in 2025 and this positive development continued in the second quarter of 2025,\" Claudia Hoyer, chief operating officer and co-chief executive officer of TAG, said. \"We are pleased with the very good operating results, which confirm that both the German and Polish residential markets continue to show high demand.\"\n\nRental income rose to 184.2 million euros for the period, up from 178.2 million euros, TAG said. Of this, 9.16 million euros came from its rental business in Germany and Poland, which grew 4% on year.\n\nThe company stuck to its full-year guidance for 2,800 apartments sold in Poland. TAG sold 1,158 apartments in the country in the first half, down from 1,936 units in the prior-year period, but said it expects this figure to be higher between July and December because of continued strong market momentum and Poland's falling interest rates.",
