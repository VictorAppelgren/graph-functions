Experts recommend starting with virtual trading, using demo accounts, and gradually scaling positions while maintaining emotional discipline and clear entry/exit plans. The piece underscores that day trading should not be seen as a get‑rich‑quick scheme but as a high‑risk strategy requiring careful preparation and risk tolerance assessment.",
