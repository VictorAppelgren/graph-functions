      "feedback": "**Feedback & Edit Instructions**\n\n1. **Canonical Handle Mapping** – Mortgage rates are *not* a listed canonical handle. Add an explicit link to a handle that drives them, e.g.  \n   *“Mortgage rates track UST 10‑year yields; a 10 bp rise in UST 10‑year yields pushes mortgage rates up ~5 bp (LF0UUL917).”*  \n   This satisfies the acceptance gate (handle + sign/magnitude).\n\n2. **Magnitude Range** – Keep the stated 6.5–7.5 % range but phrase it as a *forecasted* band:  \n   *“Mortgage rates are forecast to stay in a 6.5–7.5 % band over the next 12–18 months (LF0UUL917).”*\n\n3. **Catalyst Window** – The draft already cites the 16‑17 Sept 2025 FOMC meeting. Ensure it’s framed as the *next* key catalyst:  \n   *“The next catalyst is the FOMC meeting on 16‑17 Sept 2025; a pause or cut will compress the spread and pull rates down 0.25–0.5 % (LF0UUL917).”*\n\n4. **Remove/Replace Eurozone Reference** – “real‑rate differential of roughly 0.5 % above the eurozone” is not a canonical handle. Replace with a handle that exists (e.g., Bund 10‑year) or delete the sentence.  \n\n5. **Consistency & Brevity** – Trim any redundant phrasing (e.g., “real‑rate differential” repeated). Keep the narrative tight, action‑oriented, and anchored to the handle and catalyst.\n\n6. **Citation Density** – All substantive claims must reference LF0UUL917; add the new handle citation where you insert the UST 10‑year link.\n\nApplying these edits will align the analysis with the acceptance gate, maintain multi‑year structural focus, and produce a concise, defensible view suitable for top macro PMs.",
