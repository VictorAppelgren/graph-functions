  "title": "Why Leeds can draw 50,000-plus fans in Ireland: \u2018Saturday will feel like a home game\u2019",
  "description": "Leeds take on Milan in Dublin on Saturday and a big crowd is anticipated at the Aviva Stadium",
  "content": "Leeds United will conclude the preparation for their Premier League return 194 miles away from Elland Road, but it will feel like a home game. On Saturday, they face Milan at Dublin\u2019s Aviva Stadium, where the majority of the 50,000-plus crowd will be in Leeds colours.\n\nThis will feel like a home away from home for Daniel Farke and his side. There is an almost mythical, fanatical connection between the Republic of Ireland and Leeds. The club is like a family heirloom, passed through generations in Limerick, Galway, Cork and every corner of the Emerald Isle.\n\nWhy, though? What is it about this football club from West Yorkshire that has so convincingly won hearts and minds on the other side of the Irish Sea?\n\nLike so many, Gerry Lynch inherited the passion from his father, Donal, who had been an avid fan from the 1960s onwards, enraptured by Don Revie\u2019s iconic team.\n\nLynch was born in Cork in 1981 and grew up in Dublin. He had no say in the matter. After a sister who did not like football and a brother who took to Aston Villa and their Irish contingent, Lynch would be handed the Leeds fan baton.\n\nLeeds fans may recognise Lynch\u2019s name from his channel on YouTube, The Leeds View. That\u2019s his outlet for a passion that began during childhood walks alongside his father, who regaled him with the glory years.\n\n\u201cHe would have always talked about this classy image of the all-white kit taken from really wanting Leeds to be like Real Madrid,\u201d he tells The Athletic. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a top side in Europe and be seen as the best in the world, you\u2019ve got to look like the best in the world.\n\n\u201cThey had this pristine white kit, and then you had players like John Giles, who was Irish and was a big hero in Ireland. Then you had the grit and the brawn of Billy Bremner in a hard-hitting Leeds side.\n\n\u201cLeeds were different from everybody else, and Leeds put it up to everyone else. They weren\u2019t the favoured side, and people in England didn\u2019t always like Leeds.\n\n\u201cThat was maybe part of the reason (why Irish people followed Leeds) as well. It\u2019s nice to be following an underdog that can put it up to these teams. Leeds did. It all stems from that.\u201d\n\nPatrick Savage, 32, speaks to The Athletic with a strong Irish accent, but he was born in Bradford. He is a member of the club\u2019s Dublin supporters group, but did not move to the Irish capital until he was eight years old in 2000.\n\nPatrick\u2019s Irish father had moved to Leeds in the 1960s and, like Lynch\u2019s father Donal, fell in love with Revie\u2019s United. As Patrick grew up near the city, he would frequently go to Elland Road with his dad, who also gave him all the best stories from the previous decades.\n\n\u201cHe would have got to witness the best Leeds team around (growing up there in the 1960s and \u201970s),\u201d he said. \u201cI would get the stories from him, going to the games, queuing up for tickets. He always said he met Revie outside the ground.\n\n\u201cHe still talks like it\u2019s a childhood memory for him. We used to go to Peter Lorimer\u2019s pub all the time, and he\u2019d be acting like a little schoolboy around him.\u201d\n\nAfter the move to Dublin, the trips, inevitably, became less frequent. Still, he had been bitten by the bug. Ireland, he says, is full of generation after generation just like him.\n\n\u201cThe connection for us is all through the parents growing up, watching the team in the \u201970s and all the Irish players,\u201d he said. \u201cThe connection\u2019s really strong.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get into a taxi in Dublin without the taxi man being a Leeds fan. It\u2019s impossible. The whole journey home is just chatting to the man about Leeds.\u201d\n\nGerry McDermott is arguably one of the best-known Leeds fans in Ireland. He says he set up the club\u2019s first supporter groups in Cork, Galway, Dublin and Limerick.\n\nHe is 65 now and in that same generation as Lynch and Patrick\u2019s fathers. He did not inherit his Leeds passion from a relative. It came down to picking the team in white when he watched the 1970 FA Cup final, between Leeds and Chelsea, on television as a 10-year-old.\n\nThe presence of an Irish legend like Giles only cemented that love as he watched on in awe of what Revie\u2019s side did on the pitch. This is where the generational pull started.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s from grandfathers to their sons and now it\u2019s passed on to their grandsons as well,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the 1980s approached, McDermott became old enough to start making his own pilgrimage to Elland Road to see his beloved side in the flesh. It\u2019s a route that has become well-trodden over the years. Taking that trip has become a badge of honour for so many Irish fans.\n\nLike many others, McDermott began with ferries in the 1980s and then transitioned into flights through the mid-1990s and onwards. The increasing convenience of travel between Ireland and Leeds played a significant part in retaining that core of support for decade after decade.\n\nIt\u2019s still an expensive and time-consuming endeavour, but for those who have time and money to spare, the trip to Elland Road is a rite of passage. McDermott worked for the supermarket chain Tesco for 42 years and would regularly save up his year\u2019s holiday for a four-week splurge on Leeds United in the UK.\n\nLynch\u2019s first trip to Elland Road came in May 2005, when Leeds played out a 0-0 draw in the Championship with Rotherham United. It\u2019s a stadium that has kept him coming back. Even when he has failed to get a match ticket, Lynch has journeyed to watch the game on TV in The Old Peacock pub across the road from Elland Road.\n\nHe sees Dublin airport packed with Leeds fans whenever he has flown over on a matchday. There were so many making the trip that you would unexpectedly bump into neighbours, 200 miles from home, he said.\n\n\u201cThe Irish following, especially during the League One days, when it was much easier to get tickets for Elland Road\u2026 the volume of people was huge,\u201d said Lynch. \u201cYou\u2019d be over to see the game and you\u2019d be seeing people you live on the same street with in the ground, but you wouldn\u2019t have told you were going.\u201d\n\nLeeds is a city that has grown to mean everything to Lynch. Like so many families, and not just Irish ones, United brought him closer to his relatives. Those shared experiences are priceless to him, just as visiting Billy Bremner\u2019s statue is to him now.\n\n\u201cMy dad and I had some amazing times going,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had so much fun. As I got older, as a kid, I got closer to my dad because of the time we spent together going to Leeds games. He passed away eight years ago. There\u2019s a stone beside Billy Bremner\u2019s statue. I got a stone put down for him.\n\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s buried in Galway, but I never feel like he\u2019s buried in Galway. I feel like he\u2019s in Leeds because, when I go there, I make sure I go and see the stone and always get a feeling he\u2019s around the ground. There\u2019s just a connection there with it now, to my family and to me.\u201d\n\nThose Elland Road connections will be felt far closer to home, in Dublin, on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIn Dublin on Saturday, the stadium will feel like a home game,\u201d said Lynch. It\u2019s a prediction shared by the other fans we speak to.\n\nFor McDermott, it\u2019s a crucial moment for the next generation of Irish fans to feel the full force of what this club means. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, personally, it\u2019s for the kids, really. I\u2019ve been through it all, but it\u2019s the look on the kids.\n\n\u201cIf we can replicate the atmosphere inside the Aviva that you get in Elland Road, can you imagine a 12-year-old or 11-year-old, what his feelings are going to be in the middle of that?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about getting kids into loving football and loving their team and the atmosphere and the noise. Every kid likes that.\u201d\n\nLeeds are the talk of the town. For thousands of natives, this will be their first chance to see the team in the flesh.\n\nEven for those who do not consider themselves Leeds fans, they want to experience the legend first-hand. They have heard all about the atmosphere created inside Elland Road.\n\n\u201cFor the fans that can\u2019t realistically afford to do it every season, it\u2019s the beauty of them being able to go to the game, watch Leeds in Ireland and then go home by seven o\u2019clock,\u201d said Patrick. \u201cThere\u2019s a serious buzz about it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve mates who are reaching out to me asking for tickets. They don\u2019t even support Leeds. They just want to see Leeds play in the Aviva. They know the atmosphere is going to be electric.\u201d\n\nPatrick\u2019s daughter is an example of the next generation of fans coming through. Much in the same way her grandfather was infected by Revie\u2019s Leeds and her dad by the David O\u2019Leary era, the sensory overload of Saturday\u2019s homecoming may be what has her taking her own kids to Elland Road in 30 years.",

      "text": "\u201cI honestly can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been 20 years,\u201d David O\u2019Leary says. \u201cI\u2019m wondering where the time has gone.\u201d\nHe is casting his mind back to May 8, 2001, a day that dragged on interminably as he and his young Leeds United team prepared for a date with destiny in Valencia. They were 90 minutes away from the Champions League final, so close they could almost touch it.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI had played in many semi-finals as a player and I got to a few different ones as a manager, but a Champions League semi-final is something else,\u201d he says. \u201cThe press conference the day before, the number of people there, the focus, it all builds up and it\u2019s so nerve-racking because you know you\u2019re so close to something really special.\n\u201cIt was just the longest day. From the moment we got up, kick-off seemed so far away. We went for a walk with the players, came back, had a meal together, went back to our rooms. I remember sitting in my room for ages, looking at my notes, going over it in my mind.\u201d\nThere was the short journey through the packed streets to Mestalla, where the colour and the noise were an assault on the senses. \u201cAn incredible atmosphere,\u201d O\u2019Leary says. \u201cThat stadium, where the crowd is packed in so tight and it feels like it\u2019s on top of you.\u201d\nThe longest of seasons, the longest of days\u2026 and then it was all over in a flash. Valencia, inspired by the wonderful Gaizka Mendieta, were too strong. \u201cSo near yet so far,\u201d he says.\nO\u2019Leary said something after that game about how, after the heartbreak of losing a UEFA Cup semi-final and a Champions League semi-final, he and his players would be stronger and wiser for the experience next time. It would, he said, be third time lucky. But, as every Leeds fan knows all too well, there was not a next time. From living the dream \u2014 the infamous phrase of their chairman Peter Ridsdale \u2014 the club was plunged into a nightmare, from which it has only recently begun to emerge.\nRather than the prelude to something special, that night in Valencia came to be seen as the ultimate false dawn, the beginning of the end. Those \u201cliving the dream\u201d years became tainted. But perhaps now, 20 years on, with the club\u2019s fortunes revived by Marcelo Bielsa, Leeds\u2019 supporters can look back with fondness rather than through the prism of everything that followed. They were, undeniably, good times.\nThe story begins on the west coast of Sweden, where Leeds staged a pre-season training camp in July 2000. There was an extra intensity to their preparations because they were due to play the first leg of a Champions League qualifying tie on August 9, 10 days before the Premier League season began. Still, they were seeded in the draw. Looking down the list of possible opponents, such as Herfolge, Dunaferr, Zimbru Chisinau and Inter Bratislava, there was not too much to fear.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI was gutted when we were drawn against 1860 Munich,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone was celebrating qualifying for the Champions League at the end of the previous season, but we hadn\u2019t. We still had a qualifying round to play and there weren\u2019t many tougher teams in that draw than 1860 Munich. We knew it was going to be very tough.\u201d\nOn top of that, Leeds\u2019 pre-season preparations were dogged by injuries. By the time the first leg at home came around, they were without six of their leading players, including Jonathan Woodgate, David Batty and Harry Kewell. They took a 2-0 lead, but then Olivier Dacourt and Eirik Bakke were sent off for second bookable offences \u2014 \u201ca joke\u201d, O\u2019Leary called it at the time \u2014 and the German team pulled a goal back in the final minute.\nO\u2019Leary was downbeat in his post-match press conference, asking how he was going to be able to field a team, particularly a midfield, now that he would be another two midfielders down for the second leg. \u201cI\u2019m not being defeatist,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m just being realistic.\u201d\nLeeds lined up in the Olympic Stadium with full-back Gary Kelly on the right-hand side of midfield, and Lee Bowyer, usually right-sided, on the left. At the heart of midfield were Lucas Radebe, the veteran central defender, and Matthew Jones, a teenager who would be sold to Leicester City a few months later. The odds were against Leeds, but almost as soon as the second period began, Nigel Martyn pumped a ball upfield and Mark Viduka won a tussle with two opposition defenders before teeing up Alan Smith, who calmly put Leeds 3-1 up on aggregate.\n\u201cAnd that,\u201d O\u2019Leary says, \u201cwas where the adventure started.\u201d\nSmith was the perfect symbol of that young Leeds team. He had just passed his 18th birthday when O\u2019Leary, who had just taken over as manager from George Graham, threw him in at the deep end as a substitute against Liverpool at Anfield in November 1998. Three minutes into his Premier League debut, Smith scored, an early illustration of his fearlessness and his refusal to be daunted, whatever the opposition, wherever the venue.\nAdvertisement\nAnother was Woodgate, who, like Smith, was unexpectedly elevated to the first team as an 18-year-old after O\u2019Leary\u2019s appointment. By the end of that 1998-99 season, his first at senior level, he would be playing for England. A period of stagnation had followed Leeds\u2019 league title success in 1992, but suddenly, with homegrown players such as Woodgate, Kewell, Smith, Ian Harte and Stephen McPhail thriving under O\u2019Leary, a vibrant, exciting, young team was emerging.\nO\u2019Leary found himself derided for constantly emphasising how young they were \u2014 \u201cmy babies\u201d, he liked to call them. But the accent on youth was genuine. Beyond the experienced trio of Martyn, Radebe and Batty, the majority of the squad was 24 or under when the season began. Kewell was 21 and Woodgate and McPhail were 20, as was goalkeeper Paul Robinson, who would make some significant contributions to the Champions League campaign. When reinforcements arrived a few months into the season, they were Rio Ferdinand, 21, in an \u00a318 million move from West Ham United and Robbie Keane, 20, on loan from Inter Milan.\n\u201cI tried to answer honestly by saying it was a young team,\u201d O\u2019Leary says. \u201cThat helped us a little bit. I remember when I got into the Arsenal team as a young player, going to all these places, I loved it. They were the same. Alan Smith was a wonderful lad. A young player, but a fearless player. Lee Bowyer was excellent all through that campaign. It was a group of players who, wherever we went, whoever we played against, they would never be fazed by anything.\u201d\nNot even that resounding 4-0 defeat by a Rivaldo-inspired Barcelona in the opening group game? \u201cThat was a tough night,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had a lot of injuries that season. I thought to myself, \u2018Is it me? Is it something we\u2019re doing in training?\u2019 But we had six players missing for that game and, to be honest, I went down to Barcelona fearing for my life because I knew how good they were and I knew there would be no hiding place there. I feared we would get a good hiding that night. And we did.\u201d\nThe Independent called it \u201ca torrid initiation\u201d to the Champions League. The BBC called it a \u201cpainful lesson\u201d. It was both of things. Three days later, Leeds lost at home to Ipswich Town. By the time AC Milan rolled into town the following week, O\u2019Leary and his youngsters were up against it.\nThe names roll off the tongue. Paolo Maldini, Alessandro Costacurta, Demetrio Albertini, Oliver Bierhoff, Andriy Shevchenko. At that time, Milan were the great aristocrats of European football. But on a night when the rain lashed down at Elland Road, in an atmosphere that is recalled as one of the loudest and most partisan the old place has witnessed in several decades, they were taken far from their comfort zone \u2014 the conditions, the noise and the sheer intensity of Leeds\u2019 performance.\n\u201cI had played against Paolo Maldini in the past,\u201d O\u2019Leary says. \u201cHe came up to me at half-time and saying, \u2018David, what are you feeding your players on? They\u2019re mad, the way they charge around\u2019.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe liked to play at a high tempo, similar to how the Leeds team play now. We didn\u2019t go man-to-man, the way Marcelo\u2019s team does, but it was the same high tempo in training every day. We trained hard. There were people who said, \u2018You can\u2019t train at that intensity. You won\u2019t be able to keep it up\u2019. I think you can if you have the right players. We had players like Alan Smith and Mark Viduka, who were our first line of defence, Lee Bowyer non-stop in midfield.\n\u201cI had a simple message for the players: win the ball back as quickly and go and express yourselves. We had a way. I believe in a way of pressing from the front, getting in your faces. I don\u2019t think the teams we played that year enjoyed that. Top players don\u2019t like it when you get in their face.\u201d\nThe memories come flooding back for O\u2019Leary: Smith giving Maldini such a rough time much that the great Italian defender, usually so impeccable, was shown the yellow card for dragging him to the ground; Danny Mills sliding across the turf to produce a perfect tackle to deny Shevchenko what looked like a certain goal; and the noise that reached a crescendo late on when Bowyer\u2019s shot squirmed through Dida\u2019s grasp to give Leeds a precious victory.\n\ud83d\udcc5 | #OnThisNight in 2000, #LUFC defeated @acmilan 1-0 in the Champions League. 35,000 watched Lee Bowyer score the decisive goal at Elland Road pic.twitter.com/0rKZy8PqS4\n\u2014 Leeds United (@LUFC) September 19, 2019\nWith that, they were up and running. They thrashed Besiktas 6-0 before a tense 0-0 draw on their return to Istanbul, where two Leeds supporters, Kevin Speight and Christopher Loftus, were fatally stabbed the night before the UEFA Cup semi-final against Galatasaray earlier that year. All the focus in the build-up to that game was about security and the behaviour of both sets of supporters, including the 138 who had travelled from West Yorkshire. The match passed peacefully and, in the circumstances, that mattered far more than the point Leeds gained on a night when eight of their starters, including Robinson and midfielder Jacob Burns, were aged 23 or under.\nIn the return game against Barcelona, Rivaldo and his team-mates saw a very different Leeds to the one that had collapsed at Nou Camp just six weeks earlier. O\u2019Leary\u2019s team took an early lead from Bowyer\u2019s free kick and, chasing a victory that would have taken them through to the second group stage at Barcelona\u2019s expense, they hung on defiantly until the fourth minute of stoppage time when the outstanding Robinson was finally beaten by Rivaldo.\nAnd so to Milan for the final group game in one of the great cathedrals of European football. \u201cThey were a group of players who, wherever we went \u2014 Barcelona, Istanbul, Milan, Rome, Madrid \u2014 we would go out onto the pitch and have a look around the night before and they would say, \u2018Yeah, I like the look of this\u2019,\u201d O\u2019Leary says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the younger players. Mark Viduka was similar. If you were playing AC Milan, you knew you would get a great performance from Mark. If it was Middlesbrough, you couldn\u2019t be sure. But the whole team, really, they were never in awe of anyone. They just wanted to go out and enjoy the occasion.\u201d\nThey certainly enjoyed it at San Siro, where, as Leeds\u2019 fans still like to sing, Dominic Matteo scored \u201ca f***ing great goal\u201d to earn a 1-1 draw that took them through with Milan, leaving Barcelona to drop down into the UEFA Cup. \u201cIt was a great night,\u201d O\u2019Leary says. \u201cBoth Milan games were really great nights. Their coaches called us in afterwards and we chinked beer bottles with them. I think they were pleased we had got through and Barcelona hadn\u2019t. They probably felt Barcelona were contenders to win it and we weren\u2019t.\u201d\nThe scenes after the final whistle, as Leeds\u2019 players enjoyed a singalong with their supporters on the pitch, will live long in the memory. O\u2019Leary\u2019s \u201cbabies\u201d had come of age.\n\ud83d\udc4f \u201cA prestige goal, in a prestige match for Leeds United!\u201d https://t.co/ujRMELRKpq pic.twitter.com/6wEndc7tYO\n\u2014 Leeds United (@LUFC) March 22, 2020\nThe Champions League campaign alone made for a rich storyline. But there was so much more going on at Leeds at that time. That included the case involving Woodgate and Bowyer, who were charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent and affray following an incident near a Leeds nightclub in January 2000, in which an Asian student, Sarfraz Najeib, was left with severe injuries.\nAdvertisement\nThat unedifying story was revisited extensively by The Athletic in 2019. Woodgate was given 100 hours of community service after being found guilty of affray at Hull Crown Court in December 2001. Bowyer was cleared of all charges but later agreed a \u00a3170,000 out-of-court settlement of a civil action for damages brought by Najeib and his brother, who was also injured in the assault. Paul Clifford, a friend of Woodgate\u2019s, was jailed for six years after being found guilty of grievous bodily harm.\nThe internal and external damage done by the Bowyer-Woodgate trial would come to be regarded as significant factors in the unravelling that followed, but in the short term Leeds \u2014 Bowyer in particular \u2014 seemed unaffected by the negative publicity. In O\u2019Leary\u2019s book Leeds United on Trial he describes Bowyer\u2019s performances throughout that period, particularly during the trial, as phenomenal.\nDespite the dark cloud hanging over the club and over himself and Woodgate in particular, Bowyer continued to inspire Leeds in the second group stage. They were beaten 2-0 at home by Real Madrid, but bounced back with a 1-0 victory in Rome over Lazio, whose coach Sven-Goran Eriksson was about to become England\u2019s first overseas manager.\nWhen the tournament resumed in February, they beat Anderlecht home and away, the latter a terrific 4-1 win. Once more Smith was among the goals, his fourth and fifth of the Champions League campaign. Once more Bowyer was outstanding. The off-the-field scrutiny was increasing by the week, but with two games still to play in the group, Leeds had clinched their place in the quarter-finals.\nOn April 4, 2001, in the Champions League quarter-final first leg against Deportivo La Coruna, Leeds produced a performance that is regarded as one of the finest since the club\u2019s heyday under Don Revie in the 1960s and 1970s. As they toyed with their opponents, like a champion matador with a tiring bull, the crowd started to taunt the Spanish champions \u2014 ole, ole, ole \u2014 before a new chant took hold. \u201cThree-nil to the weakest link,\u201d to the tune of Go West.\nThe weakest link? That is how Victor, the Deportivo forward, had referred to Leeds after the quarter-final draw. \u201cWe were very pleased when we heard Leeds would be our opponents,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the weakest team in the competition. When you compare them to the others, we have got the easiest draw.\u201d\nAnd yet here Deportivo were, 3-0 down and being dominated in midfield by Dacourt, tormented by Kewell and dragged this way and that by the ebullient Smith. \u201cI would have to say that was our best performance,\u201d O\u2019Leary says. \u201cEvery player, from one to XI, was nine out of 10 on the night. It was a wonderful performance against a really strong team.\n\ud83d\udcc5 | #OnThisDay in 2001, #LUFC defeated Deportivo de La Coruna 3-0 at Elland Road in the Champions League Quarter Finals pic.twitter.com/r8JsbIeCxq\n\u2014 Leeds United (@LUFC) April 4, 2019\n\u201cI said I was delighted we got three because I knew how difficult it was going to be for us in the second leg. Everyone probably thought, \u2018There goes David, talking them down again\u2019, but I\u2019d seen a lot of tapes of them and I knew they were a really good team. We were poor in the second leg. They scored twice and we just about hung on to reach the semi-finals. If someone had predicted that back in August, I think they would have been locked up.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe semi-final first leg against Valencia was on O\u2019Leary\u2019s 43rd birthday. \u201cI got a cake and everyone was making a fuss,\u201d he says. \u201cMy dad came over for the game, bless him. Again, the atmosphere at Elland Road that night was amazing. Valencia had a wise old coach, Hector Cuper. He wasn\u2019t the friendliest, but he had a really good team. We were a bit disappointed with 0-0 because we would have liked to score, but we hadn\u2019t conceded an away goal. That was important, we felt. Looking at our record that season, I felt we could go there and score an away goal. I kept saying that. \u2018Keep it tight. And if we score one goal\u2026\u2019\u201d\nIn the space of seven days, Leeds faced Valencia at home, Arsenal away in an important Premier League match and then Valencia away. It was while holed up in the Sopwell House hotel in Hertfordshire after a 2-1 defeat at Highbury, a blow to their hopes of qualifying for the following season\u2019s Champions League, that their players had the bright idea of shaving their heads. The only exceptions were Bowyer and Woodgate, who were advised not to go for that shaven-headed look with a court case looming, and Harte, who decided he would rather have a full head of hair when his wedding photos were taken a few weeks later.\nO\u2019Leary was not impressed by the shaven heads. \u201cI didn\u2019t like it,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought it was them being young and stupid. I went absolutely mad with them. They were young boys and they thought, \u2018Let\u2019s look lean and mean going into battle\u2019. I\u2019m not sure about that. I didn\u2019t approve. They thought I was an old prude.\u201d\nBeyond that, O\u2019Leary felt that it played towards a certain unwelcome narrative. In the build-up to the second leg, the Spanish media portrayed Leeds, an increasingly familiar and increasingly bullish opponent, as thugs. A few eyebrows were raised in the Leeds camp at one particular report which suggested that Ferdinand and Matteo were notorious for being two of the dirtiest players in the Premier League. Maybe it was just propaganda.\nThere was, though, another twist the day before the second leg when Leeds learned that UEFA\u2019s disciplinary body had suspended Bowyer for three matches \u2014 which would also include the final if they got there \u2014 after appearing to stamp on Juan Sanchez during the game at Elland Road. \u201cThat was a massive blow for us,\u201d O\u2019Leary us. \u201cIt was a right kick in the teeth. Lee was such an important player for us.\u201d\nAnd so to the longest day \u2014 the pre-match walk, the pre-match meal, back to his hotel room to read and then re-read his notes. O\u2019Leary had made a point of saying in his pre-match press conference the night before that his players had to seize the moment. He talked of how, as a young player at Arsenal, he played in three FA Cup finals by the time age of 22. When Arsenal lost the third of those finals to Ipswich, he took it for granted there would be another one before long. There wasn\u2019t. By the time he reached another FA Cup final, he was 35.\nHe kept telling his players to enjoy the moment, but to seize the moment. They had done that all the way from Munich via Milan, Rome, Brussels and, in a roundabout way, A Coruna, showing absolutely no fear, but now, at Mestalla, came a different type of test. The pressure was on now. The stakes were so high.\nAdvertisement\nIt was a bridge too far. Valencia ran out comfortable 3-0 winners. Might it have been different if referee Urs Meier had spotted that Sanchez appeared to use his arm to convert Mendieta\u2019s cross for the opener? \u201cI didn\u2019t want to mention that,\u201d O\u2019Leary says, not entirely convincingly. \u201cDid it change the result? Look, the better team won. I said to the players afterwards, \u2018You should be really proud of what you\u2019ve done this season\u2019.\u201d\nHe could not contain his frustration, though, when it came to Smith, who at 3-0 down was sent off for a wild lunge at Vicente. Smith was in tears when O\u2019Leary came into the dressing room, but the manager was not in forgiving mood. Looking back, O\u2019Leary is inclined to blame himself. \u201cI probably made a poor man-management decision there,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were losing and we could see he was getting frustrated. I should have taken him off at that point. Sometimes aggression got the better of Alan. But he was a winner.\u201d\nA bad night got worse when the team\u2019s police escort to the airport didn\u2019t arrive. They had to wait on their bus outside the stadium while Valencia\u2019s supporters celebrated all around them. Talk about adding insult to injury. \u201cHave a look at what you could have won,\u201d as they used to say on Bullseye. And now, despite seeing a huge improvement in their Premier League form since the turn of the year, Leeds were fighting a losing battle to make sure they were back in the Champions League the following season.\nTwo days after Leeds were beaten 2-0 at Elland Road by Real Madrid, in their opening game of the second group stage in November 2000, the club agreed to break the British transfer record by signing Ferdinand from West Ham in a deal worth \u00a318 million. It was a deal, according to Ridsdale, that signalled confirmation of Leeds\u2019 status as a serious emerging force in English and European football.\nO\u2019Leary was conspicuous by his absence from the press conference to parade the new signing. He was delighted the club had signed Ferdinand, whom he had recommended to the board that summer as the ideal long-term replacement for Radebe, but he was shocked and alarmed by the size of the fee \u2014 so much so that, according to Ridsdale, the manager refused to attend the press conference because he \u201ccalled it obscene and said he wasn\u2019t prepared to be part of it. As an employee of a PLC, when we had just spent a world record fee (for a defender) to get him a player he wanted, that was not appropriate.\u201d\nThere is no love lost between O\u2019Leary and Ridsdale, whose manager-chairman relationship soured and has never healed. As Leeds descended into financial meltdown over the years that followed, Ridsdale pointed the finger at O\u2019Leary for requesting signings such as Ferdinand, Dacourt, Viduka, Keane and, later, Robbie Fowler and Seth Johnson as the club gambled more and more money in pursuit of Champions League qualification. O\u2019Leary portrays the situation rather differently.\n\u201cThey asked me to recommend players,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had a great defender and captain in Lucas Radebe \u2014 a great player and just a fantastic man \u2014 but he was playing on one knee at times. He was willingly playing on one knee because that\u2019s the kind of man he is. They asked me for a long-term scenario to recommend three players. The one I put at the top of my list was Rio Ferdinand. I said it would probably cost \u00a310 million to get him from West Ham.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThere was a lot of negativity around Rio at the time. A lot of people said he was too casual and made mistakes. But David O\u2019Leary knows a bit about centre-backs and I said that if money was no object going forward, Rio was going to be a top-class player and he would be top of my list. I didn\u2019t think we had the money to go that way. It dragged on for months \u2014 so much so that I was convinced Manchester United would come in and whisk him away \u2014 and then I was told one day we had done a deal. When I was told it was \u00a318 million, I was in shock. I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t ask me if I was prepared to spend \u00a318 million on him. If they had, my bottle would have gone.\u201d\nThis does not mean O\u2019Leary was in any way unhappy that Leeds signed Ferdinand. He says he was delighted and that the defender, \u201ca great player and a really good lad with it\u201d, exceeded his high expectations. But at the end of a truly memorable season, Leeds came fourth in the Premier League \u2014 two points behind second-placed Arsenal, one point behind third-placed Liverpool \u2014 and missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the campaign.\nThe following season, which was overshadowed by the Bowyer-Woodgate trial, they finished fifth and narrowly missed out again. And it was then that the extent of Leeds\u2019 financial difficulties began to emerge. By the end of the 2001-02 the club\u2019s debt had soared to \u00a378 million, with the club taking out a \u00a360 million loan secured against future season ticket sales, O\u2019Leary says he had no idea of the extent of the gamble that Ridsdale and the board took out with every big-name signing added to the squad \u2014 not to mention the \u00a320 a month spent on an aquarium for the chairman\u2019s office.\n\u201cI swear on my mum\u2019s bible, I did not have a clue about the finances,\u201d O\u2019Leary says. \u201cI never felt I was under pressure to get into the Champions League because I never knew about the gamble the club had taken,\u201d O\u2019Leary says. \u201cThey never said anything to me about needing to get into the top three or the top four and qualify for the Champions League. The last game of the (2001-02) we beat Middlesbrough to finish above Chelsea and qualify for the UEFA Cup and everyone seemed happy. Nobody ever said to me, \u2018Yes, but we\u2019re not in the Champions League\u2019.\n\u201cThe shock came to me when I got the sack (in the summer of 2002) and things started to come out in the wash. I was astounded when people told me what people were earning at the club. Nothing was ever hidden from me \u2014 I could have gone and asked \u2014 but I was astounded. I played no part in any of that. My part was the way I described it with Rio.\u201d\nWith no Champions League revenue to help pay the bills and ease their debt burden, Leeds faced meltdown. O\u2019Leary was sacked; the club initially announced he had departed by mutual consent, but then issued another statement, later that day, saying he had been sacked. The line that came out of the club at the time was that O\u2019Leary had lost the dressing room, notably with the publication of that book and with his observations on the Bowyer-Woodgate case, after which he said \u201cit would have made it easier (for the club) if they had both gone inside.\u201d\nMills, notably, has been scathing about O\u2019Leary over the years, criticising his tactics and man-management. \u201cSome players might be against you because they\u2019re not playing or they haven\u2019t got the contract they want,\u201d O\u2019Leary says. \u201cThat\u2019s normal. But the fans never bought into the cheap shots about losing the dressing room. That was sickening, the way they (the club) tried to peddle that. You would be amazed how many of those players called up afterwards to say how disappointed they were.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBy the time O\u2019Leary returned to Elland Road as Aston Villa manager on Boxing Day 2003, Ferdinand, Woodgate, Keane, Fowler, Bowyer, Kewell, Dacourt and Martyn had been sold as the club cleared the decks. Terry Venables, who succeeded O\u2019Leary as manager, had been sacked, as had Peter Reid, who came next. Even Ridsdale had gone. Leeds were hurtling towards relegation.\n\u201cIt was sad to see from a distance,\u201d O\u2019Leary says. \u201cI remember going back with Villa and everyone in the stadium coming to greet you, but you\u2019re trying to beat them because you\u2019ve got a job to do. I couldn\u2019t believe they were going down. I remember later in the season reading a newspaper article by Patrick Collins about the state of things at Leeds, how bad it had got, and I was shocked reading it. I remember Villa had a game at Southampton at the end of that season. We were challenging for Europe and on that same day Leeds were relegated. It was very sad to see.\u201d\nO\u2019Leary\u2019s short-lived managerial career is a curiosity. The way that Leeds team came together in the late 1990s and early 2000s \u2014 yes, that young team, his \u201cbabies\u201d \u2014 was impressive. It was fiercely competitive at the top of the Premier League around that time, up against Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s Manchester United, Arsene Wenger\u2019s Arsenal, Gerard Houllier\u2019s Liverpool, Gianluca Vialli\u2019s (and later Claudio Ranieri\u2019s) Chelsea and Sir Bobby Robson\u2019s Newcastle United. To get into Europe took some doing. To reach UEFA Cup and Champions League semi-finals in consecutive years was highly impressive.\nHe admits he made mistakes at Leeds. He feels he was a better, wiser manager at Villa, whom he led to sixth place in the Premier League in his first season, but that the ambitions were thwarted by financial constraints as Doug Ellis prepared to sell the Midlands club. He never imagined when he was sacked by Villa in the summer of 2006, at the age of 48, that he would never manage in the Premier League again. His only managerial job in the past 15 years was a season at Al-Ahli in the UAE Pro League. These days he is an ambassador and adviser at Arsenal (something he prefers not to go into in an interview looking back at that Champions League campaign 20 years ago).\nHe turned 63 last week and, if there were times when he expected to return to management in the Premier League, he suspects that ship has sailed. \u201cI never had an agent,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the time I left Villa things had changed in football and it had started to be all about agents being in with chief executives, pushing your name. I never had that. I probably should have. But you don\u2019t have four years at Leeds, got to two European semi-finals, if you\u2019re not doing something right. You don\u2019t manage three years at Villa under Doug Ellis if you\u2019re not doing something right.\u201d\nThere is one job that got away. He was interviewed by Newcastle in the summer of 2009, after their relegation, and while his gut feeling told him it wasn\u2019t the right job, he does occasionally wonder what might have been. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right, but I probably should have taken it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was probably a mistake. It\u2019s a big club, another one-club city like Leeds, great support. That would have been a good job.\u201d\nO\u2019Leary still lives in Harrogate, north of Leeds, and, while Arsenal was his first love, he retains great affection for the club where he enjoyed his best years as a manager. \u201cI go there when Arsenal aren\u2019t playing,\u201d he says. \u201cI fell in love with the club, the people, the area. It\u2019s a one-club city. Everything is about that club. The way it builds up through the week, you feel that pressure. I enjoyed that pressure.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe pressure of managing Leeds proved overwhelming for some of the managers who came and went during the wilderness years that followed his departure. For years there was dysfunction, disconnect and disappointment after disappointment. And then, in the summer of 2018, came Bielsa.\n\u201cThe club seems to be run the right way now,\u201d O\u2019Leary says. \u201cThat\u2019s the impression I have of the people behind the scenes. And they have a really good manager. He\u2019s at the perfect club, where they let him do what he wants to do and he has a group of players who do what he wants them to do. He does it his way. They\u2019re a perfect fit for each other. It\u2019s a great fit for the Premier League.\n\u201cI never had any doubt they would do well this year. I did an interview with BBC at the end of last season and I said this manager isn\u2019t going into the Premier League just to survive. They\u2019ve been excellent, the football they play. Stuart Dallas has been a revelation. Raphinha has been an absolutely fantastic signing. Patrick Bamford speaks so well and has done so well this season. I feel maybe there\u2019s a bit of pressure taken off him without the fans there. I\u2019m delighted for him. I thought he might struggle to take chances, but they\u2019ve taken their chances.\u201d\nO\u2019Leary hesitates. \u201cI nearly ran him down the other day, you know,\u201d he says\nWhat?! Bamford?!\n\u201cNo, Marcelo! I was going through Wetherby. I nearly ran him down. I gave him a beep and he shouted back at me.\n\u201cWe go to the same church. I wouldn\u2019t say I know him, but it\u2019s amazing he has ended up at Leeds because, funnily enough, I went to Argentina many years ago when he was coaching their national team. I was introduced to him then. I always admired him. I always tried to play a similar way to how he plays. High-octane, in-your-face football.\u201d\nO\u2019Leary is proud of that Leeds team 20 years ago. He regrets that they did not win a trophy \u2014 he feels maybe they should have tried harder for an FA Cup or a League Cup \u2014 but he looks back fondly on those times and on a team who, by upsetting the establishment and ruffling so many feathers, came so close to doing something truly extraordinary.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI remember playing golf out in Girona with Johan Cruyff, great man, and he told me we were like \u2018football rock and roll\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are great to watch and we were a bit mad with it. We had a style of play that was completely different to the way others were playing at that time.\u201d\nAnd he still sometimes finds himself reflecting on that night 20 years ago when Leeds really did find themselves \u201cliving the dream\u201d. It was so close, only to slip through their fingers, never to return. \u201cI went back to Valencia with Arsenal two seasons ago,\u201d he says. I was sitting with the chairman, Sir Chips Keswick, before the game and I must have just been very quiet looking around at the stadium. He said to me, \u2018David, are you alright?\u2019 And I was just reminiscing. They were great times.\u201d\n(Main image: Photos: Getty Images; design \u2013 Sam Richardson)"

      "text": "The fictional aspects of The Damned Utd \u2014 the parts of David Peace\u2019s novel that swim in artistic licence \u2014 ring no less true in spirit. On his second day as Leeds United manager, Brian Clough takes an axe to Don Revie\u2019s desk and sets fire to the wood in the car park at Elland Road. \u201cI light a cigarette and take a couple of drags before I throw it on the pile and watch it all bloody burn,\u201d he says. An old era, up in smoke.\nAdvertisement\nRegardless of the accuracy of that tale, you can imagine Clough being sorely tempted. Revie\u2019s aura was everywhere at Leeds and Clough wanted rid of it. \u201cAll the photos and the files, all the bloody dossiers,\u201d he thinks to himself. \u201cEvery other fucking thing in that office. Burn, burn, burn.\u201d\nNothing had more of Revie about it than the dossiers. This was England in 1974 and everyone knew about them, friend and foe. Page after page detailed the ins and outs of opposition teams and the files were an extension of Revie\u2019s personality: ambitious, visionary, tinged with paranoia and laced with a compulsion to turn over every stone. Each Leeds game yielded typewritten paper, neatly prepared by his faithful secretary, who waited each week for the latest batch of notes to arrive.\nAs Revie\u2019s players learned, the significance of individual matches was incidental to his appetite for knowledge. He tried not to make exceptions when it came to scouting ahead. \u201cThe dossiers could be useful, especially in Europe, where the teams were unfamiliar,\u201d Peter Lorimer once told me, \u201cbut when it came to games against lower-league players, cup ties and so on, they could make the full-back you were playing against sound like the best player in the world. I knew he was nowhere near that good. Just let me go out there and beat the arse off him!\u201d\nFootball today is firmly on Revie\u2019s side of the fence. The depth of his analysis and intelligence-gathering was modern thinking, decades before the birth of Prozone and the arrival of data scientists at professional clubs.\nLast week, The Athletic was passed the contents of a dossier written for Revie while he was in charge of England \u2014 a document which has never been seen before. It covers the European Championship third-place play-off between Holland and Yugoslavia in 1976 and consists of more than 10 pages of typed and hand-written observations. I show some of them to Brian McDermott, the ex-Leeds manager, who works as a senior scout for Arsenal. \u201cHonestly,\u201d he says, \u201cif you stuck that in a dressing room in 2020, it wouldn\u2019t look out of place at all. Put that in front of any current player and they\u2019d get it.\u201d\nRevie wanted to know everything he could about the teams he might face; everything and more. He wanted information on individual players, the tactical variations used by other managers, drills employed at set-pieces and specific strengths and weaknesses, irrespective of how minor the findings were. The part in The Damned Utd where Clough chastises Maurice Lindley, Revie\u2019s assistant, for producing a dossier for a pre-season game against Huddersfield \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s a bloody testimonial. A fucking friendly!\u201d \u2014 inadvertently acknowledged Revie\u2019s devotion to his craft. Those of us who sat through Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s \u201cSpygate\u201d press conference last year and listened to Bielsa saying that excessive analysis controlled his anxiety could almost hear Revie speaking.\nAdvertisement\nThe 1976 dossier was compiled by Les Cocker, a coach who Revie grew to trust unconditionally at Leeds and who went with him to the England camp in 1974. Revie\u2019s backroom team at Elland Road \u2014 Cocker, Lindley and Syd Owen \u2014 shared scouting responsibilities and Cocker would sit up until the early hours after a midweek game, using the same LP cover to lean on and jot down his thoughts. The Hit Makers cover, which his family still has, is covered in doodles drawn by Cocker as he went. Not one of Revie\u2019s lieutenants was prone to cutting corners.\nThe production line was organised and efficient. A handwritten version of a scouting report would be passed to Jean Reid, Revie\u2019s secretary, to be reproduced with a typewriter. Revie retained Reid\u2019s secretarial services after he quit Elland Road for the England job. The document from 1976 is marked \u201cLC/JKR\u201d (Les Cocker/Jean Reid) and dated July 5, two and a half weeks after Cocker sat through Holland\u2019s win over Yugoslavia at Stadion Maksimir in Zagreb on June 19. Cocker came home from the former Yugoslavia with 11 pages of observations, some of them scribbled on headed paper from the Hotel InterContinental where he was staying. Holland, who had lost to eventual winners Czechoslovakia in the semi-finals, earned a 3-2 victory in extra-time.\nRevie\u2019s England team had been eliminated in the qualifying stages for the Euros but were scheduled to play Holland in a friendly at Wembley the following February. There were no plans to meet Yugoslavia but football in eastern Europe was on an upward trajectory, so Cocker outlined everything about them regardless: the 1-3-3-3 system in which Josip Katalinski played as a sweeper, the team\u2019s reluctance to man-mark, full-backs committing too high up the pitch and a lengthy paragraph spelling out the quality of each player.\nHis comments range from cutting to complimentary but offer insight either way. He describes Drazen Muzinic as \u201ca joke at left-back\u201d but reminds Revie that Muzinic normally plays in midfield or the centre of defence. Danilo Popivoda is a \u201cgood, fast attacking player whose runs must be picked up\u201d and Jovan Acimovic is \u201ca real fatty\u201d who is \u201cstruggling to play\u201d due to his physical state. Cocker has his ear to the ground and can predict which of Yugoslavia\u2019s players might fall by the wayside before the World Cup in 1978, the next major tournament aimed for by Revie until he and England acrimoniously parted company in 1977. Branko Oblak is one. \u201cWill not be around for 1978, according to the grapevine,\u201d Cocker writes. And the midfielder did, indeed, retire from international football before the World Cup.\nCocker\u2019s overview of the Yugoslav tactics looks closely on Oblak, who drops too deep too often and invites Holland to apply a high press. Do that, he says, and you\u2019re in trouble. He picks apart corners and free kicks: how Yugoslavia defend them and how they attack from them. The sweeper Katalinski (whom Cocker is glowing about) is key in both scenarios. Deliveries to the back post are the best way of taking out his aerial dominance. \u201cHe\u2019s so big and powerful,\u201d Cocker says. \u201cHe\u2019s as big as Ron Yeats (Liverpool\u2019s centre-half).\u201d When Yugoslavia win free kicks, they like to catch you out by taking them from the wrong place. \u201cReferees in this competition allowed that to be done,\u201d Cocker reports. As his career went on, Revie took to analysing match officials, too.\nAdvertisement\nThe observations are made in real-time and without any access to video replays. Cocker\u2019s only opportunity to pick Yugoslavia and Holland apart is the fast-flowing game in front of him. \u201cFor me, it would be like going back to when I was managing Slough or Woking,\u201d McDermott says. \u201cIt\u2019s analysis without any technology to help, which is why it\u2019s so impressive.\n\u201cThe detail\u2019s incredible and the best thing about it is the simplicity of the language. It\u2019s easy to understand and you can tell it\u2019s been written by a football man \u2014 someone who loves the game, knows all about it and knows what his manager wants him to look for. Everything in there is common sense.\u201d\nHolland get the same treatment. They\u2019ve fallen short of the European final, so their coach, George Knobel, makes changes for the third-place play-off. Johan Cruyff, Johan Neeskens, Willem van Hanegem and Johnny Rep drop out of the Dutch squad but Cocker notes how the quality of their midfield remains intact. It is also obvious that the entire Holland camp are tuned into one style of play. \u201cThe Dutch must be well off for midfield players if these lads are not regulars,\u201d Cocker reflects and that is where they hurt Yugoslavia. Rob Rensenbrink, Cocker warns, will \u201cskin you alive\u201d if he goes one-v-one. He spots that both Ruud Krol and Rene van de Kerkhof are right-footers playing on the left. Stand off Krol and he\u2019ll play square passes all day. \u201cHe wants you to have a bite at him so he can go past you,\u201d Cocker says.\nThere are shortcomings as well. Yugoslavia\u2019s fightback from 2-0 down comes after they throw Katalinski up front and cause havoc with his height. Cockers says this \u201crevealed one of their weaknesses and had the Dutch team on the rack\u201d and he suggests to Revie that England could profit from set-pieces against Holland if the service is good enough. Goalkeeper Piet Schrijvers rarely leaves his line or catches the ball and the back post is always left unmarked. Adrie van Kraay looks prone to leaving space behind him. But Cocker is in no doubt. Holland were excellent, fit and should have put Yugoslavia to the sword in normal time. They can stretch you out wide or through the middle and their performance \u201ccould have have been exploited far more than it was in this game\u201d.\nThe feedback Cocker was able to provide from one 120-minute match in the Eastern Bloc in the mid-1970s is extraordinary, a complete Who\u2019s Who of two of Europe\u2019s stronger nations. Parts of it are particularly perceptive. He is effusive in his praise of midfielder Jan Peters, calling him \u201ca great player on and off the ball\u201d. When England and Holland met at Wembley eight months later, Peters scored twice in a 2-0 win for the Dutch.\nSome in the England squad, however, were unimpressed by Revie\u2019s research and analytical brain. To them, the detail was excessive and unnecessary and his team selections had a habit of confusing them. At Leeds, everything worked for him like clockwork. With England, his dossiers were contentious and ridiculed by the media. \u201cThe problem for the England boys was that they weren\u2019t used to them,\u201d says Eddie Gray. \u201cAll of us at Leeds, we\u2019d grown up with them.\u201d\nIn the foreword to a biography called Revie: Revered and Reviled, Kevin Keegan \u2014 Revie\u2019s England captain \u2014 wrote that \u201c75 per cent of the England players bought into the dossier idea but the other quarter didn\u2019t. Unfortunately for Don, the press picked up on the 25 per cent\u201d. But time has been kind and the 1976 report from Yugoslavia shows him embracing analytical techniques that football was decades from grasping properly. Other managers would make notes pre-match but none of their preparation was so complex.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cFrom the point where I joined the club, it was part of what we did,\u201d Gray says. \u201cEach player would get a dossier before a match and it would tell you just about everything. They weren\u2019t so in-depth at first but they got more and more detailed as the Revie era went on. It could be monotonous reading them but that\u2019s just how it was and I found them helpful in Europe. When it came to Don and England, I don\u2019t think the England boys could see the point. It wasn\u2019t in their make-up.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say every player at Leeds loved them either. With Lorimer, you couldn\u2019t have got him to read Sporting Life! He was probably kidding on that he\u2019d taken in all the information. But that was just Peter. They were something different and there were useful bits in them. It was something no other English manager was doing at the time, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\nAs a rule, the players at Leeds were receptive when Revie spent the last couple of hours before kick-off running through his inner thoughts. \u201cMind you,\u201d says former Leeds striker Mick Jones, \u201cwe didn\u2019t think too much about the opposition. We were a top team and we didn\u2019t worry about anyone else. In fairness to Don, he never complicated things too much with me. When I signed from Sheffield United, the only instruction I got, to begin with, was \u2018keep doing what you\u2019ve been doing\u2019.\n\u201cHe\u2019d send Maurice Lindley and the others to watch every team before we played them. Maurice would come back with all the information for Don to dish out. It was all in there but to be quite honest, with the great players we had we expected to beat whoever we played. I don\u2019t think we were a great team because of the dossiers. We were a great team anyway. But Don was ahead of his time.\u201d\nA pile of the dossiers survives to this day, many of them in the possession of Cocker\u2019s son Dave. They are rarely disclosed for public consumption. Would current footballers or coaches relate to them? Bielsa might. The Argentinian\u2019s Spygate press conference was awash with laptops, iPads, projectors and video clips but under the main screen beside him, laid out on a shelf, were piles and piles of folders holding paper copies of the information his staff were collating for him \u2014 dossiers for the modern day.\nThe Damned Utd depicted Clough setting fire to Revie\u2019s labours of love. Bielsa, most likely, would have taken them home and read them, every word, cover to cover.\n(Photo: PA Images via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Strange to think of it now but this time last year, senior people at Newcastle United were referring to Bruno Guimaraes in the past tense. The team had just lost 2-0 to Manchester City in the FA Cup \u2014 one shot on target, 28 per cent possession \u2014 and the 7,800 fans who travelled to the Etihad Stadium sang: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win f*** all again\u201d, which was indisputable; 69 years without a domestic trophy was now destined to become 70.\nAdvertisement\nOut of the cups and 10th in the Premier League after a brutal run of injuries, the concept of Newcastle\u2019s inevitable progress post-takeover was dented. Off the pitch, there had been little movement on big infrastructure projects (some things don\u2019t change) and, on it, Eddie Howe\u2019s team had stalled. As The Athletic reported that day, 13 months on from their first, losing Carabao Cup final, Newcastle were \u201cnot bigger, better, stronger\u2026 Brutally put, they have regressed\u201d. It was an existential wobble and the tremors were felt internally.\nAs far as Guimaraes was concerned, Newcastle were already deep into added time. The Brazilian, who joined Newcastle from Lyon for \u00a340million ($51.7m) in January 2022, had never pushed to leave and nobody was attempting to push him out, but there had been a gentle, honest conversation the previous summer about him seeing out the club\u2019s return to the Champions League. The \u00a3100m ($129m) escape clause in his contract loomed over everything.\nAfter City, the likelihood of Guimaraes remaining at St James\u2019 Park shrivelled further. Newcastle were hurtling towards a reckoning in terms of the Premier League\u2019s profit and sustainability rules (PSR), and with the club desperate to build around Alexander Isak, their prize asset, Guimaraes became their most likely departure. One leading figure speculated in private about him joining City or Paris Saint-Germain. Their verdict: Bruno was gone.\nTo repeat: it is funny to think of now. Guimaraes, like his team-mates, is forever enshrined in Newcastle\u2019s history, instant legends after their 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Wembley a little over a week ago. He is the man who finally allows Bob Moncur to lay down his 56-year burden as the club\u2019s last captain to raise a significant piece of silverware. He is the team\u2019s heartbeat and tempo-setter, which was never more apparent than eight days ago.\nAdvertisement\nIf Dan Burn\u2019s goal and elevation to the England squad became the individual story of the weekend and Isak\u2019s goal carried a tang of inevitability \u2014 so good, so unstoppable \u2014 then Newcastle\u2019s midfield felt like the crux of it. Liverpool had no answer to Guimaraes, Joelinton and Sandro Tonali, and their combination of energy, physicality, chaos, disruption and delivery. They played like warriors and both Guimaraes and Joelinton, his great friend, celebrated tackles like gladiators.\nAfterwards, he wept (let\u2019s face it, pretty much everybody wept). He spoke about receiving a text message from Alan Shearer, the club\u2019s record goalscorer, that morning which read: \u201cBring that trophy back to the Toon please skipper\u201d followed by a series of black and white hearts.\nGuimaraes told reporters: \u201cWhen you taste it once, you want to taste more. When I came to the club, we were in a different moment but I always said I would like to put my name in the club\u2019s history. I think I did this. I did a big step.\u201d\nAnd at this point, it is worth marking just what a leap of faith was required from Guimaraes to make that big step a possibility. Of all the players who arrived in that first transfer window post-takeover \u2014 the others were Burn, Kieran Trippier, Chris Wood and Matt Targett \u2014 he was the one who pointed to a shimmering future. He was what they could become. Yes, the club now had money, but when Guimaraes signed, they had won two games all season. They were still in the bottom three. It was a risk.\nBruno believed.\nAnother strange thought (everything feels strange in the context of Newcastle\u2019s identity as serial non-winners finally being banished): this season has brought episodes of real struggle for Guimaraes.\nReturn to last summer and there were no takers for him at \u00a3100m and, as it turned out, no takers full stop. If anybody at Newcastle thought that Guimaraes would be an easy, obvious answer to their \u00a360m ($77.5m) PSR black hole, they were rudely disavowed of it and instead, the club faced an unedifying scramble to sell Elliot Anderson and Yankuba Minteh in the frantic hours before the end of the accounting period on June 30.\nAdvertisement\nThere was a feeling within the dressing room that Guimaraes was bruised by this; again, not because he sought to go but more because those around him had told them there would be options. Everybody wants to feel wanted and wanted by the best, but there was no substantive contact with Newcastle from anybody. By contrast, there had been negotiations with Liverpool over Anthony Gordon while Chelsea registered their interest in Isak.\nIt was this which partially informed Howe\u2019s decision to name Guimaraes captain ahead of the first match of this season. On the face of it, he did not feel like a natural choice in the traditional sense; he is not a shouter, English is not his first language, and he can be an emotional player. It said more about appeasement and his prominence.\nWhen he was booked in the 3-2 league defeat by City in January last year, it was his sixth yellow card in as many matches in all competitions. It left him one more away from a two-game suspension in the Premier League. Guimaraes promised there would not be another. Howe \u201cdidn\u2019t believe a word of it\u201d, he said later, but the 27-year-old was good on his promise, demonstrating that he could play with maturity.\nNewcastle\u2019s established leadership group, in which Guimaraes did not figure, was also changing. Matt Ritchie left on a free transfer last summer, Jamaal Lascelles, the club captain, and Callum Wilson were injured and no longer mainstays and Trippier had been usurped as first-choice right-back by Tino Livramento. Burn was the only member of the group to accompany the squad on their pre-season tour to Japan and quipped \u201cit\u2019s a bit lonely\u201d before one of their matches there.\nPromotion to the captaincy brought a positive response from Guimaraes. \u201cAnother dream came true, to be captain here where I am loved and love to be\u2026 there are many ways to be a leader,\u201d he said but it was not without ramifications. Now it was Trippier\u2019s turn to feel hurt, albeit he had been open to leaving Newcastle, largely for personal reasons.\nThere was a general note of disquiet throughout the dressing room. Gordon felt it after the Liverpool move fell through. In Japan, Sean Longstaff spoke to journalists about everybody feeling like they \u201chad their price\u201d. Nobody arrived to improve the first XI. It was unsettled.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for Bruno,\u201d someone close to the dressing room says, speaking anonymously to protect relationships. \u201cHe has had some resistance, as you always get with change.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe fact he could barely win a coin toss at St James\u2019 became a joke, although it meant Newcastle would be turned around and face playing uphill in the second half. Games would regularly start with a groan.\nThere have been episodes when he has looked fatigued, which is hardly surprising when last summer brought six appearances for Brazil, both in the Copa America and in preceding friendlies. He has played more minutes for Newcastle in the Premier League than anybody else, just as he did last season. Availability is one of his great strengths and it is just as well when you consider that since his first start, the team has not won a league game without him, but it does not always serve him well.\nWhen Tonali returned from his long suspension for betting offences in late August, a big question \u2014 asked regularly of Howe \u2014 was whether he and Guimaraes could play together, and which one of them might miss out. The two of them were similar, looking to control matches, and when Tonali was moved into a deeper holding role, with Guimaraes shunted forward, it was the Italian who suddenly looked like the irreplaceable one.\nA bitty, inconsistent start to the season had included a miserable 3-1 defeat at Fulham, when the big players like Guimaraes, Gordon and Isak scarcely turned up.\nSocial media, and specifically X, was pretty brutal that day.\nDavid: \u201cBruno isn\u2019t captain material. There, I dared say it out loud!\u201d\nNUFC Kobe: \u201cBruno is the most overrated player in our history.\u201d\nNUFCTony: \u201cIs Bruno the right captain for the team?\u201d\nRachael: \u201cFor me, there has been a shift in team dynamic since the captaincy has changed and I don\u2019t think it done us any favours.\u201d\nAnonymous performances \u2014 Guimaraes was not alone \u2014 against mid-ranking teams became entrenched as a theme and, in the weeks leading up to Wembley, that expanded to games against both City and Liverpool in the Premier League.\nAdvertisement\nAfter the latter fixture, right at the end of last month, John Anderson, the former Newcastle player, was scathing about Guimaraes on BBC Newcastle. \u201cHe has been awful lately,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were times when he looked like he couldn\u2019t run. He was chasing shadows at times \u2014 (Ibrahima) Konate strolled past him as if he wasn\u2019t there. He looked like he had no legs at all. I think he has been poor for a while.\u201d\nThe words were harsh but the logic was not unreasonable.\nAt his next press conference, Howe was asked about resting Guimaraes and about how much he was suffering physically. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult because I\u2019m sure if you asked Bruno, he would say he doesn\u2019t need a rest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is up to us to look at his schedule and try and find ways to do that. We have tried but he\u2019s such an important player, we have turned to him more often than we would ideally want to because of his strengths and qualities.\u201d\nDid he remain as vital as ever? \u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d Howe said. \u201cHe\u2019s in the middle of everything, really. He is behind a lot of our good play still. He is an outstanding player and will continue to be. We just need to help him in those moments where we can keep him fresh and get him to his best levels.\u201d\nThis was less than a month ago.\nIf the tone of all this seems negative, then it shouldn\u2019t because it is absolutely born of love and sometimes, love hurts. To become winners, Newcastle have had lose, both historically and this season, and Guimaraes has been required to grit his teeth and battle through. There may have been matches where he has laboured or failed to make an impact, but he has always \u2014 always \u2014 sought the ball and sought prominence. He never hides.\nSince Anfield on February 26, something has altered around Guimaraes, or at least that is how it looks. After Newcastle\u2019s 1-0 victory against West Ham United on March 10, crucial for momentum and confidence after a difficult spell, he told Sky Sports that the Carabao Cup final was \u201clike the World Cup\u201d. While much of the club\u2019s preparations were about making sure the team (and fans) would peak at Wembley, he made no attempt to play down its significance.\nAdvertisement\nIt was noticed. \u201cBruno has grown into the captaincy role, especially in and around the final,\u201d the dressing-room figure says. \u201cHe has become more vocal in the group setting and I sense the players now look at him as the leader, which is really the acid test.\u201d\nThen came the match itself. Newcastle roared and Guimaraes drove them on, prodding and pushing and perpetual motion. He was everywhere and everything. When the time came to lift the trophy, he could be seen beckoning to his left and then suddenly, there was Lascelles, who has not played a second of football this season because of an ACL injury, holding it aloft with both him and Trippier. It was a big little moment nestling within the biggest moment of all.\n\u201cIt is easy to be selfish when things like that are happening but Bruno thought of others,\u201d says the aforementioned dressing-room figure. \u201cThat is true leadership.\u201d\nSomething a bit less strange: nobody at Newcastle is talking about Guimaraes in the past tense now. Who knows what might happen in the summer and how much might depend on securing a place in the Champions League, but their PSR position is much stronger and his contract stretches until 2028. They are already guaranteed a place in next season\u2019s UEFA Conference League and have shown they can win trophies. Progress is self-evident.\nEventually, the past tense will come, though. Guimaraes will be sold, move on or retire, and a page will turn. In decades to come, he will be spoken of as Moncur\u2019s successor, as kin to Shearer, as the man who believed when nobody believed. As the perfect captain, a leader by example and a leader full stop, who looked to involve and celebrate others at the precise moment when the world was looking at him. As Newcastle\u2019s history boy.\n(Top photo: Stu Forster/Getty Images)"
