      "feedback": "The draft leverages the two near‑term legal/liquidity overhangs (Biohaven BHVN and Spirit Aviation FLYY) plus a geopolitical overlay (Israel–Yemen/Houthis) to frame a plausible 0–3 week regime, but it needs a world‑class upgrade in structure, specificity, and quantify-to-translate into tradable think, and it should tighten sourcing discipline. Key actionable edits: restructure into an explicit 0–3 week framework with a base, bear, and bull case, each tied to defined catalysts and numeric thresholds; make the catalysts and invalidations crystal clear (for BHVN: lead‑plaintiff deadline Sept 12, 2025 and the fact that no class has yet been certified; for FLYY: substantial going‑concern doubt and debt/debt‑covenant pressures; for the Yemen angle: escalation/deescalation signals and shipping/commodity risk); quantify the link between disclosures and price/volatility (cite the 40.7% one‑day drop for Spirit and the go/no‑go nature of class certification for Biohaven, and specify the 12‑monthGoing Concern caveat) and use those exact data points as the anchors of your range expectations; add explicit invalidation events (e.g., BHVN: no certification or settlement by Sept 12; FLYN: no liquidity relief or debt renegotiation within the window) and outline immediate reaction functions (probable heightened volatility, spreads on spreads, and potential trading ranges around key dates); strengthen the causal chain from regulator/class action dynamics to equity pricing by naming the mechanism (certification creates tail risk/settlement upside; liquidity news creates funding risk/credit risk reprice); deepen first‑principles grounding by noting why small‑cap going‑concern disclosures tend to drive outsized moves in 0–3 weeks absent relief; explicitly map next data points to monitor (regulatory filings, potential interim court actions, any updates on Spirit’s liquidity covenants, and any new Houthi‑related shipping disruption headlines); ensure discipline in citation: anchor every factual claim to one of the IDs (Z5IA1CYUF, 4VN4UTWX1, I2SJU04DF) and avoid mixing in non‑source assumptions; and tighten the prose to deliver a concise, calibrated watchlist with the three sources clearly reconciled in a single, testable narrative (no unresolved conflicts).",
