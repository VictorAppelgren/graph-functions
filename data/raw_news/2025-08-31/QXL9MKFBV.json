  "title": "What happened to 90s boyband lothario Andy Scott Lee",
  "description": "Unlucky-in-love Andy Scott-Lee appears to have finally found the 'one' after facing a string of hardship over the years.",
  "content": "As a boyband star with a sister in Steps, a brother-in-law in Hear'say, two reality shows and many a glossy photoshoot with OK! magazine, Andy Scott-Lee was the poster boy for a certain brand of cheesy noughties celebrity.\n\nIn addition to fronting 3SL, with his two brothers Steve and Ant, the Rhyl-born singer also starred in Totally Scott-Lee on MTV, which followed his sister Lisa's attempts to launch a solo career and documented his proposal to girlfriend Michelle Heaton of Liberty X fame.\n\nThat marriage ended acrimoniously after just two years and Andy quickly took up with dancer Lydia Louise, who went on to appear on Big Brother.\n\nNot much has been seen of him since and fans feeling nostalgic for the days when the Scott-Lees and their popstar circle were the UK's answer to the Kardashians might well wonder what happened to Andy, who was at one time never out of the headlines.\n\nAfter ditching fame for a quieter life, the 45-year-old now works in the property industry and welcomed his first child, Rome Alexander, in August 2024 with his glamorous girlfriend Amy - who he met after his second marriage to the aforementioned Lydia Louise broke down.\n\nHe's expressed his joy at finally becoming a father and it's no wonder after the drama that surrounded his marriage and divorce from Michelle - with Andy wrongly branded a 'love rat' before they had even made it down the aisle.\n\nA newspaper accused Andy of being unfaithful to the Liberty X star during the Barcelona stag do for Hear'Say singer Johnny Shentall, who married Steps star Lisa Scott-Lee.\n\nAfter denying the report, his and Michelle's Winter Wonderland wedding in 2006 - which was documented on ITV reality show Michelle and Andy's Big Day - went ahead, but hopes for a fairytale ending were dashed, and their marriage ended after just 19 months.\n\nThe divorce was acrimonious, with Andy accusing Michelle of cheating on him with several men, including one of his best friends and EastEnders actor Matt Di Angelo.\n\n'She\u2019s cheated on me, and once she started she just couldn\u2019t stop', a heartbroken Andy told the Sunday Mirror.\n\nHe claimed Michelle, who he met in 2002, cheated several times with several different men throughout their relationship. The first time he caught her was in 2007 after they had only been married for seven months.\n\nHe allegedly caught her out after she accidentally left her Facebook page open on their computer and he saw a message from one of her lovers - an ex boyfriend of one of her friends - talking about a 'mint' sex act that they did together.\n\nIt was alleged that the tryst took place while she was performing in the panto Cinderella in Sunderland.\n\nAndy shared other messages which revealed she cheated during a girls' holiday in Marbella, Spain, in 2007 with the nephew of an ex-England player.\n\nMichelle admitted in court papers that her adultery was the reason the marriage fell apart.\n\nBut she did insist to OK! Magazine that she didn't sleep with Andy's friend Matt and also denied accusations that she had relationships with Big Brother 8 stars Ziggy Lichman and Liam McGough.\n\n'I didn't sleep with Matt. The only thing I did wrong was that I found him really attractive and cute - which woman wouldn't - and as a married woman I shouldn't be thinking this.'\n\nRevealing the moment he confronted Michelle about her cheating, he told the Mirror: 'There was no way I could ignore it. I had to confront her. I brought up all the other times I knew about. She tried to deny it but there was no point.\n\n'I told her the marriage was over. We decided I\u2019d stay in the house and she moved out. We don\u2019t talk any more except by email to sort out the house'.\n\nHowever, the warring exes were more than happy to fire shots at each other publicly, with Michelle saying: 'I'm just disappointed in Andy as he has said loads of bitchy things about me over the past few months, but I've never said anything bitchy about him and I feel I have walked out of this situation with my head held high.'\n\nAndy declared in an interview that he was 'able to move on quite quickly' from the failed marriage.\n\nHe was true to his word when later that same year, he met dancer and reality star Lydia Louisa.\n\nWhen I first came out of my relationship I found it hard to trust anyone, but now I'm in my current relationship, I trust her 100pc,' he said.\n\nConfirming that he was not still in love with Michelle, he added: 'Definitely not. Good luck to the next guy.'\n\nLydia went on to compete on the 13th series of Big Brother in 2012.\n\nThroughout her time in the house, she teased her relationship with a star, but insisted she would keep his name under wraps because he was just a 'normal' bloke.\n\nHer housemates were distinctly underwhelmed when they found out the celebrity in question was Andy.\n\nThe dancer, now 39, was the fourth housemate to be evicted from Big Brother.\n\nA year later, the pair tied the knot in Las Vegas but they later went their separate ways.\n\nThird time lucky, Andy who 'never thought this day would come' is now happier than ever with his gorgeous girlfriend and their one-year-old son.\n\nThe pop icon introduced the adorable tot on his Instagram alongside pictures with his partner, whom he has chosen to share little details of.\n\nHe wrote: 'Introducing our beautiful baby boy Rome Alexander Scott-Lee. Born: 8.57 am on Thursday 25/07/24. Weight 6 lbs 5oz.\n\n'Mother and son are doing amazingly. Honestly, I never thought this day would come! I can't even put into words how it feels to become a Dad. I promise you Son, I will ALWAYS look after you and do my best to raise you properly!\n\n'Thank you to our families & friends for all your love and support. Rome is certainly going to be loved.\n\n'Finally, Thank You to my beautiful Girlfriend Amy, for making ALL my dreams come true. You are incredible! I love You and Rome very much and can't wait to start making wonderful memories together as a family.\n\n'To those reading this who still hope to have kids one day, don't give up! Your time will come!'\n\nAndy's pop group 3SL reached number 11 on the UK Singles Chart with their debut single Take It Easy in 2002.\n\nThey released one more single which charted at number 16 and were subsequently dropped by their record label Sony.\n\nAndy later appeared on the second series of Pop Idol in 2003 where he finished in seventh place.\n\nThe singer also took part in the qualifying rounds to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2005 and finished in third place.\n\nThe former pop star is reported to be in the property industry and often performs in local gigs after ditching showbiz for a quiet life away from fame.",

      "text": "Michelle Heaton's ill-fated first marriage - cheating, spats and a dumped wedding dress\nMichelle Heaton's short-lived marriage to Andy Scott-Lee blew up in a storm of cheating claims and ended with the Liberty X singer flogging her princess wedding gown to a burger van vendor at a car boot sale\nIt's been 14 years since Liberty X siren Michelle Heaton tied the knot with Andy Scott-Lee in a lavish winter Wonderland themed wedding.\nIt was a marriage of UK pop and reality royalty with Michelle shooting to fame on TV talent show Popstars and her heartthrob hubby being a member of boyband 3SL as well as the brother of Steps singer Lisa Scott-Lee.\nThe couple's fairytale wedding was the focus of ITV reality show Michelle and Andy's Big Day and a glossy magazine cover shoot, but despite the hype the marriage was over just 19 months later.\nThe split sparked a bitter war of words in the media, with Andy accusing Michelle of cheating on him with several men, including one of his best friends and former EastEnders actor Matt Di Angelo.\n\"She\u2019s cheated on me, and once she started she just couldn\u2019t stop,\" a heartbroken Andy told the Sunday Mirror at the time.\nHe claimed he first caught wind that Michelle was doing the dirty just seven months into their marriage.\nHe said he made the discovery when his wife left her Facebook page open and he saw a message from one of her 'lovers' bragging about a 'mint' sex act.\nMichelle admitted in court papers that her adultery was the reason the marriage fell apart.\nAmong the numerous infidelities Andy accused Michelle of was cheating on a girls holiday to Marbella with the nephew of a former England footballer player.\nMichelle admitted she had snogged another man on the last night of the holiday but described the kiss as a 'stupid and drunken' mistake.\nWracked with guilt, Michelle said she told Andy about it as soon as she got home.\nHowever, she denied that she had an affair with soap star Matt Di Angelo.\n\"I didn't sleep with Matt. The only thing I did wrong was that I found him really attractive and cute - which woman wouldn't - and as a married woman I shouldn't be thinking this,\" Michelle told OK! Magazine.\nMichelle also denied accusations that she had relationships with Big Brother 8 stars Ziggy Lichman and Liam McGough.\nRecalling the explosive row that ended their marriage, Andy told the Mirror: \"There was no way I could ignore it. I had to confront her. I brought up all the other times I knew about. She tried to deny it but there was no point.\n\"I told her the marriage was over. We decided I\u2019d stay in the house and she moved out. We don\u2019t talk any more except by email to sort out the house,\" he explained.\nMichelle later hit out at her husband for speaking to the press.\n\"I just feel it\u2019s sad that he feels the need to earn a living through me,\" she told new! magazine.\nFollowing her divorce from Andy, Michelle took the drastic decision to sell her princess wedding gown at a car boot sale.\nShe said the dress had been hanging in her wardrobe for some time and she was going to give it to charity before deciding to make some money out of it.\nShe went on to accept an offer of \u00a3225 from burger van vendor Natalie, who also threw in a sausage to seal the deal.\nMichelle then donated the cash to Cancer Research UK, after having been diagnosed with the mutated BRCA2 gene herself.\nMichelle is now married to Irish businessman Hugh Hanely, who she started dating shortly after her split from Andy.\nThe pair tied the knot in the Bahamas in 2010, two years after they met.\nThe couple are now parents to Faith Michelle, eight, and Aaron Jay, six.\nWhile Andy went on to marry Lydia Louise, who competed in the Big Brother UK in 2012."
